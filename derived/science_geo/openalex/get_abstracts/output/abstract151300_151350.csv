Normally COX-2 expression is tightly regulated, however, constitutive overexpression plays a key role in colon carcinogenesis. To understand the mechanisms controlling COX-2 expression, we examined the ability of the 3′-untranslated region of the COX-2 mRNA to regulate post-transcriptional events. When fused to a reporter gene, the 3′-untranslated region mediated rapid mRNA decay (t 12 = 30 min), which was comparable to endogenous COX-2 mRNA turnover in serum-induced fibroblasts treated with actinomycin D or dexamethasone. Deletion analysis demonstrated that a conserved 116-nucleotide AU-rich sequence element (ARE) mediated mRNA degradation. In transiently transfected cells, this region inhibited protein synthesis approximately 3-fold. However, this inhibition did not occur through changes in mRNA stability since mRNA half-life and steady-state mRNA levels were unchanged. RNA mobility shift assays demonstrated a complex of cytoplasmic proteins that bound specifically to the ARE, and UV cross-linking studies identified proteins ranging from 90 to 35 kDa. Fractionation of the cytosol showed differential association of ARE-binding proteins to polysomes and S130 fractions. We propose that these factors influence expression at a post-transcriptional step and, if dysregulated, may increase COX-2 protein as detected in colon cancer.

The committed step in the conversion of free arachidonic acid to prostaglandins is catalyzed by cyclooxygenase (COX),1 also termed prostaglandin H synthase (4.Smith W.L. Garavato R.M. DeWitt D.L. J.

There are two isoforms of cyclooxygenase; the type 1 (COX-1) isoform is present under resting conditions in many cells, and presumably makes prostaglandins for physiological functions. The type 2 (COX-2) is not normally present under basal conditions, or present in very low amounts, but is rapidly induced by cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters to result in prostaglandin synthesis associated with inflammation and carcinogenesis (5.Kujubu D.A.

Early studies of the regulation of inducible COX activity identified time-dependent modulation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional phases of the COX biosynthetic pathway (9.Raz A. Wyche A. Needleman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1657-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Since the molecular cloning and characterization of COX-2, extensive studies identified transcriptional regulation of COX-2 (10.Inoue H. Nanayama T. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T.

COX-2 also may be regulated at the post-transcriptional level since the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of its mRNA contains multiple copies of adelylate- and uridylate-rich (AU-rich) elements (AREs) composed of the sequence 5′-AUUUA-3′. This element, which is present within the 3′-UTRs of many proto-oncogene and cytokine mRNAs, confers post-transcriptional control of expression by acting as a mRNA instability determinant (14.Caput D.

To further understand the molecular mechanisms that control the expression of the COX-2 protein, we examined the ability of the ARE-containing 3′-UTR of the COX-2 message to mediate post-transcriptional regulation of expression. The results presented here demonstrate that the 3′-UTR of COX-2 can influence mRNA stability along with controlling translation efficiency. Analysis of the sequences within the 3′-UTR identified a conserved 116-nucleotide AU-rich element responsible for rapid mRNA turnover and translational inhibition. Using RNA gel shift assays and label transfer analysis, we identified cytoplasmic proteins with apparent molecular masses ranging from 90 to 35 kDa that bound specifically to the COX-2 ARE. WI38, a human lung fibroblast cell line, was maintained in Eagle's basal medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in normal medium, then growth-arrested by incubation in Eagle's basal medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. Subsequent serum stimulation was initiated by the addition of fetal bovine serum to 20%. COS7 and HeLa cells were passed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. RNA half-life experiments were initiated by adding ActD (5 μg/ml) or Dex (1 μm) to the growth medium. Stable transfections of COS7 cells were accomplished by plating cells at a density of 1 × 105 cells per 60-mm culture dish 18–20 h prior to transfection. Five μg of luciferase+3′UTR reporter cDNAs contained in the pcDNA3.1/Zeo expression vector (Invitrogen) were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the vendor's instructions. Stably transfected cells were selected in normal growth medium containing 400 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) for 2–3 weeks. Several hundred zeocin-resistant colonies were pooled and subsequently used in the indicated experiments. Transient transfections of COS7 cells with full-length COX-2 or COX-2Δ3′-UTR expression plasmids were carried out similarly except 1 μg of expression plasmid was co-transfected with 0.5 μg of the pSV-β-Gal (Promega) plasmid using 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 6-well tissue culture plates. The transfection medium was replaced after 6 h with normal growth medium and the cells were incubated for 24 h before analysis. Transient transfections of lacZ+3′UTR reporter cDNA constructs contained in the pcDNAI/Amp expression vector (Invitrogen) were done identically except transfections were carried out in 12-well tissue culture plates and all reagents were scaled accordingly. The full-length human COX-2 cDNA contained in the vector pBlueScript II (KS+) (Stratagene) was inserted into the EcoRI site of the expression vector pcDNA3. Deletion of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 was accomplished by standard PCR techniques using primers to amplify the 5′-UTR and coding region of COX-2. The PCR amplified product (COX-2Δ3′-UTR) was subcloned into the vector pCRII by T/A cloning (Invitrogen) and then inserted into theBamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3. β-Gal reporter expression constructs illustrated in Fig. 4 were created as follows. The pβ-GalΔ 3′-UTR expression construct containing the lacZ cDNA without a 3′-UTR was created by PCR amplification of the β-Gal coding region from pSV-β-Gal; the 5′-end of the product was flanked by a HindIII site and the 3′-end contained a BamHI site adjacent to the stop codon. The fragment was subsequently cloned into the HindIII andBamHI sites of pcDNAI/Amp. The 3′-UTR of COX-2 was amplified by PCR from full-length COX-2 cDNA contained in pBlueScript II (KS+) using a forward primer to place a BamHI site at the 5′-end of the 3′-UTR and the M13 reverse primer used for the 3′-end. The product was digested with BamHI andXhoI and subcloned into pBlueScript (KS+). The full-length 3′-UTR was inserted into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pβ-GalΔ3′-UTR to create pβ-Gal+3′UTR. The pβ-GalΔ234 and pβ-GalΔ892 constructs were made by digesting pβ-Gal+3′UTR withSphI to remove 216 bp or partial digestion withHindIII to remove 874 bp, respectively. Complete plasmids containing the 3′-UTR deletions were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and religated. The plasmid pβ-Gal+3′UTR was digested with HindIII and ScaI to generate a 3469-bplacZ+ARE fragment that was agarose gel-purified and inserted into the HindIII and EcoRV sites of pcDNAI/Amp to create pβ-Gal+ARE. The construct pβ-GalΔARE was made by digesting pβ-Gal+3′UTR with XhoI and partial digestion with ScaI. The remaining 3′-UTR fragment (1392 bp) was inserted into the filled-in BamHI site and theXhoI site of pβ-GalΔ3′-UTR. Luciferase reporter expression constructs illustrated in Fig. 2 were prepared in the vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) containing the luciferase cDNA from pGL3-Basic (Promega) cloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites to yield pLucΔ3′-UTR. Addition of the COX-2 3′-UTR was accomplished by PCR amplifying the COX-2 3′-UTR usingXbaI-tailed primers and inserting it adjacent to the luciferase coding region to yield pLuc+3′UTR. The constructs pLuc+ARE and pLucΔARE were prepared similarly as the pβ-Gal+ARE and pβ-GalΔARE, respectively. All DNA constructs were analyzed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Plasmid DNAs were purified by two rounds of cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation (36.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The plasmid pBlueScript II (KS+) containing the 5′-end region of the COX-2 cDNA (bases 11–424; (8.Jones D.J. Carlton D.P. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9049-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was linearized with XbaI; transcription from the T3 promoter yielded a 508-nucleotide antisense riboprobe. A 383-bp region of the neomycin resistance gene from pcDNA3 was cloned into pLitmus-29 (New England Biolabs) and a 381-bp region of the luciferase cDNA from pGL3-Basic was cloned into pBlueScript II (KS+); transcription from the T7 promoter on linearized plasmids yielded riboprobes of 495 and 425 nucleotides in length, respectively. Linearized plasmids used to generate riboprobes for human c- myc and GAPDH were purchased from Ambion. In vitro transcription reactions incorporating [α-32P]UTP (50 μCi) were performed using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Template DNA was removed by incubating the reaction with 2 units of RNase-free DNase I (Ambion) for 15 min at 37 °C. Purification of radiolabeled riboprobe was accomplished using Elutip-R purification columns (Schleicher & Schuell) or TE Midi Select-D G-25 spin columns (5 Prime-3 Prime, Inc.) and quantitated by scintillation counting. The specific activity was typically 106-107 cpm/μg of RNA. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and chloroform extraction according to the vendor's RNA isolation protocol for use in RNase protection assay or reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). RNase protection assay was done according to the RPA II kit (Ambion) with the following modifications (37.Dixon D.A. Vaikus D.L. Prescott S.M. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 732-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Total RNA samples (5 μg) were incubated at 37 °C in 1× NEBuffer 2 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) (New England Biolabs) containing 2 units of RNase free-DNase I for 15 min. 32P-Labeled antisense riboprobe was added and both the sample RNA and probe were co-precipitated in ethanol. The RNA/riboprobe pellet was dissolved in hybridization buffer and incubated overnight at 45 °C. Subsequent RNase A and T1 digestions were done and the protected riboprobe fragments were separated on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The protected riboprobes yielded fragments of 413, 383, 316, and 250 nucleotides for COX-2, neo, GAPDH, and c-myc mRNAs, respectively. Quantitation of the relative mRNA levels was accomplished by PhosphorImager analysis using the STORM 860 system (Molecular Dynamics). RT-PCR analysis of mRNA was accomplished as follows. One μg of total RNA served as template for single strand cDNA synthesis in a reaction using oligo(dT) primers and SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) under conditions indicated by the manufacturer. The sequences for the following PCR primers used were: luciferase sense, 5′-ACGGATTACCAGGGATTTCAGTC-3′ and luciferase antisense, 5′-AGGCTCCTCAGAAACAGCTCTTC-3′; β-actin sense, 5′-GAAAATCTGGCACCACACCTTC-3′ and β-actin antisense, 5′-GCTCATTGCCAATGGTGATGAC-3′; GAPDH sense 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′ and GAPDH antisense 5′-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′. PCR of cDNA samples was performed as described previously (8.Jones D.J. Carlton D.P. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9049-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with samples amplified for 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The amplified PCR products for luciferase had a size of 367 bp. PCR reactions from COS7 cell cDNA containing β-actin and GAPDH primers yielded products of sizes similar to reactions using human cDNA (514 and 600 bp, respectively). PCR products were analyzed by 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis containing ethidium bromide and quantitated digitally using 1D Image Analysis Software (Kodak). Northern blot analysis was carried out according to Sheng et al. (38.Sheng H. Williams C.S. Shao J. Liang P. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22120-22127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Total RNA (20 μg) was extracted at the indicated time points and separated on 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels. The RNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and fixed to the membrane by UV cross-linking. Membranes were prehybridized in NorthernMax prehybridization-hybridization buffer (Ambion) and then hybridized for 16 h with 1 × 106 cpm/ml of a32P-labeled antisense riboprobe specific for luciferase at 65 °C. Blots were then washed twice for 15 min at room temperature with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and 3 times at 65 °C with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min prior to autoradiography and PhosphorImaging. 18 S rRNA signals were used as controls for RNA loading and integrity. Luciferase mRNA levels were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis and normalized to signals for 18 S rRNA. COS7 cells transfected with COX-2 expression constructs were lysed in 250 μl of cell lysis buffer (39.Habib A. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23448-23454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis after separation of 25 μg of cell lysate on 10% SDS-PAGE. Protein content was determined using a BCA protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard (Pierce). Detection of COX-2 protein was accomplished using a mouse monoclonal antibody against human COX-2 as described (39.Habib A. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23448-23454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control β-Gal protein expression was detected on the same blot using a monoclonal antibody against β-galactosidase according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The blots were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to Bio-Max MR film (Kodak); quantitation of the relative COX-2 and control β-Gal protein levels was accomplished by digital analysis using 1D Image Analysis Software (Kodak). Cells transfected with β-Gal expression constructs were lysed in 150 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and chemiluminescent detection of enzymatic activity was used to quantitate β-Gal protein expression. Aliquots (0.5 μl) of cell extract were assayed for β-Gal activity using Galacto-Light (Tropix) and control luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). β-Gal activity was normalized to luciferase activity and all results reported are the averages of three independent experiments done in triplicate. The pβ-Gal+3′UTR plasmid was digested with BamHI and ScaI to release the 116-bp COX-2 ARE sequence, which was cloned into theBamHI and EcoRV sites of pBlueScript (KS+). Complementary oligonucleotides containing the GM-CSF AU-rich element (15.Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar) were annealed and cloned into the BamHI site of pBlueScript (KS+). pTRI-CAT (Ambion) was used to create a control CAT RNA. In vitro transcription reactions incorporating [α-32P]UTP (50 μCi) were performed using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase as indicated above to yield sense RNAs for COX-2 and GM-CSF AREs of sizes 188 and 151 nucleotides, respectively; the control CAT RNA is 213 nucleotides in size. Unlabeled competitor RNAs were made using the Ribomax kit (Promega). Cytoplasmic cell lysates were prepared as indicated (22.Gillis P. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3172-3177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. COS7 and HeLa cells were grown in p150 tissue culture dishes until confluent, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before 4 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40) was added and the cells frozen at −70 °C. Thawed cells were scraped from the plate, vortexed briefly (15 s), and centrifuged at 14,000 × gfor 10 min. The supernatant was assayed for protein concentration using a BCA protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard and used immediately or snap frozen at −70 °C. For native gel mobility shift assay, 5 μg of COS7 cytoplasmic lysate was incubated with 1 × 104 cpm of RNA in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) in a total volume of 20 μl. The mixture was then incubated for 15 min at room temperature, heparin was added to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml and incubation continued for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were electrophoresed in 4% polyacrylamide gels (60:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 0.5 × TBE (Tris borate-EDTA) buffer containing 5% glycerol, dried, and exposed overnight with Kodak Bio-Max MS film and an intensifying screen. For competition experiments, unlabeled amounts of the stated RNAs were added to labeled COX-2 ARE prior to the addition of 1 μg of lysate. For UV cross-linking experiments, 10 μg of lysate from COS7 or HeLa cells were incubated with 1 × 105 cpm of labeled RNAs in a 40-μl reaction as described above. Where indicated, cytoplasmic lysates were digested with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of RNA. Reaction mixtures were UV-irradiated in 96-well trays in a Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene) for 5 min and then incubated with 10 μg of RNase A and 5 units of RNase T1 (Ambion) for 30 min at 37 °C. Laemmli buffer containing dithiothreitol was added and the samples were boiled for 3 min and electrophoresed in 10% denaturing SDS-PAGE with prestained or low-range molecular size markers (Bio-Rad). The 32P-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Confluent cultures of COS7 cells grown in p150 tissue culture dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Cells were removed from dishes by scraping and pelleted at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Polysomes were isolated as described previously (40.Rajagopalan L.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23882-23888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Crude cytoplasmic lysates were prepared by adding 2 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 per p150 dish of cells and centrifuged (12,000 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was layered on a sucrose cushion composed of Buffer A containing 30% sucrose and centrifuged 36,000 rpm for 135 min at 4 °C in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor. The postribosomal supernatant (S130 fraction) was separated from the sucrose cushion and the polysome pellets were resuspended in Buffer A. The cytoplasmic lysate, S130 fraction, and polysome fraction was assayed for protein concentration using a BCA protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard and used immediately or snap frozen at −70 °C. The expression of COX-2 has been demonstrated to occur through transcriptional activation that is induced by cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters (5.Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C.

Yet, growing experimental evidence has demonstrated that COX-2 expression is also regulated on a post-transcriptional level (38.Sheng H. Williams C.S. Shao J. Liang P. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. J.

To determine if the AU-rich 3′-UTR of COX-2 mediates post-transcriptional regulation by changing mRNA stability, we measured COX-2 mRNA half-life (t[ifrax,1/2]) values in serum-stimulated human lung fibroblasts that also were treated with actinomycin D (ActD). Total RNA was isolated at various times after ActD treatment, and the stability of COX-2 mRNA was examined by RNase protection analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the level of COX-2 mRNA decayed significantly during the initial 2 h after ActD treatment; however, at later time points (>120 min) COX-2 mRNA stabilization was observed. This may have resulted from the ability of ActD to interfere with degradation (20.Rajagopalan L.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19871-19876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 44.Esnault S. Jarzembowski J.A. Malter J.S. Proc. Assoc. Am.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5777-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Using the observed initial decay values, we determined the half-life of the COX-2 mRNA to be approximately 90 min (Fig. 1 B). This rate is greater than the inducible proto-oncogene of c-myc(t 12 = 27 min), but is similar to the half-lives of the induced cytokine mRNAs of interleukin-6 (t 12 = 67 min), interleukin-8 (t 12 = 44 min), and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF;t 12 = 61 min) (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). The ability of the COX-2 mRNA to be rapidly degraded in the absence of ActD treatment was demonstrated using the glucocorticoid Dex (Fig. 1). In serum-stimulated fibroblasts rapid decay of COX-2 mRNA occurred following the addition of Dex (t 12 = 39 min), whereas Dex did not influence the turnover of c-myc(t 12 > 240 min). The ability of Dex to influence COX-2 mRNA stability was also seen in phorbol ester-stimulated HeLa cells. However, transcription was necessary for Dex-mediated mRNA turnover since the addition of ActD attenuated COX-2 mRNA degradation. 2D. A. Dixon, T. M. McIntyre, G. A. Zimmerman, and S. M. Prescott, unpublished observations. These findings agree with other results that show a rapid turnover of COX-2 mRNA and that glucocorticoids increase the rate of degradation (47.Evett G.E. Xie W."

During angiogenesis this membrane undergoes many alterations and these changes are speculated to influence the formation of new capillaries. Type IV collagen is a major component of vascular basement membrane, and recently we identified a fragment of type IV collagen α2 chain with specific anti-angiogenic properties (Kamphaus, G. D., Colorado, P. C., Panka, D. J., Hopfer, H., Ramchandran, R., Torre, A., Maeshima, Y., Mier, J. W., Sukhatme, V. P., and Kalluri, R. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 1209–1215). In the present study we characterize two different antitumor activities associated with the noncollagenous 1 (NC1) domain of the α3 chain of type IV collagen. This domain was previously discovered to possess a C-terminal peptide sequence (amino acids 185–203) that inhibits melanoma cell proliferation (Han, J., Ohno, N., Pasco, S., Monboisse, J. C., Borel, J. P., and Kefalides, N. A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 20395–20401). In the present study, we identify the anti-angiogenic capacity of this domain using several in vitro and in vivo assays. The α3(IV)NC1 inhibited in vivoneovascularization in matrigel plug assays and suppressed tumor growth of human renal cell carcinoma (786-O) and prostate carcinoma (PC-3) in mouse xenograft models associated with in vivo endothelial cell-specific apoptosis. The anti-angiogenic activity was localized to amino acids 54–132 using deletion mutagenesis. This anti-angiogenic region is separate from the 185–203 amino acid region responsible for the antitumor cell activity. Additionally, our experiments indicate that the antitumor cell activity is not realized until the peptide region is exposed by truncation of the α3(IV)NC1 domain, a requirement not essential for the anti-angiogenic activity of this domain. Collectively, these results effectively highlight the distinct and unique antitumor properties of the α3(IV)NC1 domain and the potential use of this molecule for inhibition of tumor growth.

In the present study we characterize two different antitumor activities associated with the noncollagenous 1 (NC1) domain of the α3 chain of type IV collagen.

Ann. Surg. 1972; 175: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). In the adult, new blood vessels arise via angiogenesis, a process critical for normal physiological events such as wound repair, the ovarian cycle, and endometrium remodeling (2.Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, uncontrolled neovascularization is associated with a number of pathological disorders including diabetic retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, as well as tumor growth, and metastasis (3.Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7217) Google Scholar, 4.Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). Tumor growth and metastasis require angiogenesis (1.Folkman J. Ann. Surg. 1972; 175: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar), and this process is pivotal to the survival and subsequent growth of solid tumors beyond a few mm3 in size (3.Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7217) Google Scholar). Expansion of tumor mass occurs not only by perfusion of blood through the tumor but also by paracrine stimulation of tumor cells by several growth factors and matrix proteins produced by the new capillary endothelium (3.Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7217) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of angiogenesis inhibitors have been identified, namely angiostatin, endostatin, restin, and pigment epithelium-derived factor (5.O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C.

Basement membranes are thin layers of a specialized extracellular matrix that provide the supporting structure on which epithelial and endothelial cells grow and that surround muscle, fat, etc. (9.Paulsson M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 93-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). They are always associated with cells, and it has been well demonstrated that basement membranes do not only provide a mechanical support but also influence cellular behavior such as differentiation and proliferation. The major macromolecular constituents of basement membranes are type IV collagen, laminin, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, fibronectin, and entactin (10.Timpl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Vascular basement membrane constitutes an insoluble structural wall of newly formed capillaries and is speculated to play an important role in regulating pro- and anti-angiogenic events (11.Madri J.A. Transplant. Immunol. 1997; 5: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In general, type IV collagen promotes cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and growth (11.Madri J.A. Transplant. Immunol. 1997; 5: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Type IV collagen is expressed as six distinct α-chains, namely, α1-α6 (12.Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar), assembles into triple helices, and further forms a network to provide a scaffold for other macromolecules in basement membranes. These α-chains are composed of three domains, the N-terminal 7 S domain, the middle triple helical domain, and the C-terminal globular noncollagenous domain (NC1)1(13.Timpl R. Wiedemann H. van Delden V. Furthmayr H. Kuhn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 120: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The α1 and α2 isoforms are ubiquitously present in human basement membranes (9.Paulsson M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 93-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The other four isoforms exhibit more tissue and organ-specific distributions (14.Kalluri R. Shield C.F. Todd P. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2470-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 15.Kashtan C.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1736-1750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution of the α3 (IV) chain is limited to certain basement membranes, such as glomerular basement membrane, several basement membranes of the cochlea, ocular basement membrane of the anterior lens capsule, Descemet's membrane, ovarian and testicular basement membrane (16.Frojdman K. Pelliniemi L.J. Virtanen I. Differentiation. 1998; 63: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and alveolar capillary basement membrane (15.Kashtan C.E. J. Am. Soc.

This chain is absent from epidermal basement membranes of the skin and the vascular basement membrane of liver (15.Kashtan C.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1736-1750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α3(IV) NC1 domain has been shown to bind and inhibit the proliferation of melanoma and other epithelial tumor cell linesin vitro (19.Han J. Ohno N. Pasco S. Monboisse J.C. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20395-20401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Han et al. (19.Han J. Ohno N. Pasco S. Monboisse J.C. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. J. Biol.

Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against this site were able to block melanoma cell adhesion and inhibition of proliferation (19.Han J. Ohno N. Pasco S. Monboisse J.C. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20395-20401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). They also found that the specific sequence, -SNS-, located within amino acids 189–191, was required for both the melanoma cell adhesion and inhibition of proliferation (19.Han J. Ohno N. Pasco S. Monboisse J.C. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20395-20401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Additionally, these investigators did not use the isolated human α3(IV) NC1 domain in these studies (19.Han J. Ohno N. Pasco S. Monboisse J.C. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20395-20401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In these studies, the 185–203 α3(IV) NC1 synthetic peptide was not tested on other cell types, including endothelial cells. Recent studies have illustrated the anti-angiogenic properties associated with inhibitors of collagen synthesis, supporting the notion that basement membrane collagen assembly and organization is important for blood vessel formation (20.Maragoudakis M.E.

Tsopanoglou N.E. Pipili-Synetos E. Microvasc. Res. 1995; 50: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the NC1 domain of type IV collagen is speculated to play a crucial role in the assembly of type IV collagen to form trimers and thus influence basement membrane organization and modulation of cell behavior (10.Timpl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 11.Madri J.A. Transplant. Immunol. 1997; 5: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22.Madri J.A.

Biol. 1994; 164: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These prior observations coupled with the identification of endostatin as the type XVIII collagen NC1 domain (6.O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R. Folkman J. Cell. 1997; 88: 277-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine the anti-angiogenic property of the NC1 domain of type IV collagen. In this regard, recently our laboratory identified a novel type IV collagen-associated inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth, termed canstatin. Canstatin (NC1 domain of α2 chain) was identified as an endothelial cell-specific apoptotic agent (25.Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A. Maeshima Y. Mier J.W. Sukhatme V.P. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1209-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate the pivotal role of the NC1 domain of the α3 chain of human type IV collagen (13.Timpl R. Wiedemann H. van Delden V. Furthmayr H. Kuhn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 120: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 26.Turner N. Mason P.J. Brown R. Fox M. Povey S. Rees A. Pusey C.D. J. Clin.

We named this domain “tumstatin” (for its unique property of causing “tumor stasis”) to add another member to the newly discovered family of endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis derived from larger proteins, such as angiostatin, endostatin, restin, and canstatin (5.O'Reilly M.S.

Among the six NC1 domains of type IV collagen, three exhibited promising anti-angiogenic activity with distinct mechanisms of action (25.Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2520-2526PubMed Google Scholar). The NC1 domain of the α3 chain (tumstatin) was most potent in inhibiting the proliferation of endothelial cells and causing apoptosis when compared with the other α(IV) chain NC1 domains. This newly discovered anti-angiogenic property of tumstatin, coupled with the previously reported antitumor cell activity, makes tumstatin a potentially useful therapeutic molecule in inhibiting tumor growth. The sequence encoding tumstatin was amplified using polymerase chain reaction from the α3(IV)NC1/pDS vector (28.Neilson E.G. Kalluri R. Sun M.J. Gunwar S. Danoff T. Mariyama M. Myers J.C. Reeders S.T. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8402-8405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting cDNA fragment was ligated into pET22b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). This placed tumstatin downstream of the pelB leader sequence, allowing for periplasmic localization and expression of soluble protein. The 3′-end of the sequence was ligated in-frame with the polyhistidine tag sequence. Plasmid constructs encoding tumstatin were first transformed into E. coli HMS174 (Novagen, Madison, WI) and then transformed into BL21 for expression (Novagen). Overnight bacterial culture was used to inoculate a 500-ml culture in LB medium (Fisher). This culture was grown for ∼4 h until the cells reached an A 600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After a 2-h induction period, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g and lysed by resuspension in 6 m guanidine, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Resuspended cells were sonicated briefly, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant fraction was passed over the nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). Nonspecifically bound protein was removed by washing with both 10 and 25 mm imidazole in 8 m urea, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Tumstatin protein was eluted from the column with increasing concentrations of imidazole (50, 125, and 250 mm) in 8m urea buffer. The eluted protein was dialyzed twice against PBS at 4 °C and separated into insoluble and soluble fractions. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). Recombinant deletion mutants of tumstatin, tum-1–4, were produced in E. coli using pET28a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified as described above. Mouse endostatin was produced inE. coli using pET vector system and purified as described previously (29.Dhanabal M. Ramchandran R. Volk R. Stillman I.E. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Simons M. Sukhatme V.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble tumstatin was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described previously (30.Kalluri R. Sun M.J. Hudson B.G.

Rabbit antibody raised against human α3(IV)NC1 was prepared as described previously (14.Kalluri R. Shield C.F. Todd P. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. J. Clin.

We used the pDS plasmid containing α3(IV)NC1 (28.Neilson E.G. Kalluri R. Sun M.J. Gunwar S. Danoff T. Mariyama M. Myers J.C. Reeders S.T. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

The leader sequence from the 5′-end of the full-length α3(IV) chain was cloned 5′ to the NC1 domain to enable protein secretion into the culture medium. The tumstatin containing recombinant vectors were sequenced, and error-free cDNA clones were further purified and used for in vitro translation studies to confirm protein expression (data not shown). The tumstatin-containing plasmid and control plasmid were used to transfect 293 cells using the calcium chloride method (25.Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A.

The cells were passed for three weeks in the presence of the geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) until no cell death was evident. Clones were expanded into T-225 flasks and grown until confluent. Then, the supernatant was collected and concentrated using an amicon concentrator (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the tumstatin expression. Strong binding in the supernatant was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot using a tumstatin (α3(IV)NC1) -derived synthetic peptide antibody raised in rabbit (14.Kalluri R.

A renal clear cell carcinoma line (786-O), a human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line (PC-3), bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (C-PAE), human primary prostate epithelial cells (HPE); human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and a mouse aortic endothelial cell line (MAE) were all obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines were maintained in DMEM (786-O and C-PAE; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin, or in EGM-2 (human umbilical vein endothelial cells and MAE; Clonetics, San Diego, CA). HPE cells were cultured in keratinocyte-SFM supplemented with bovine pituitary extract and recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Life Technologies, Inc.). The melanoma cell line W-164 was obtained from Dr. Meenhard Herlyn at the Wistar Institute (Philadelphia, PA). The melanoma cell line was cultivated in medium MCDB-153 (78%) with L-15 medium (10%), tryptose phosphate broth (10%), fetal bovine serum (2%), and 50 units/ml insulin, as described previously by Herlyn et al.

Polymyxin B (Sigma) at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml was used to inactivate endotoxin (32.Liu S. Tobias R. McClure S. Styba G. Shi Q. Jackowski G. Clin. Biochem. 1997; 30: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Briefly, C-PAE cells (passages 2–4) were grown to confluence and kept contact inhibited for 48 h. 786-O, PC-3, HPE, and WM-164 cells were used as nonendothelial controls. Cells were trypsinized and a suspension of 12,500 cells in DMEM with 0.1% FCS was added to each well of a 24-well plate precoated with fibronectin. The cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, and medium was replaced with DMEM containing 20% FCS. Unstimulated control cells were incubated with medium containing 0.1% FCS. Cells were treated with various concentrations of tumstatin or deletion mutants. All wells received 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine 12 h after the beginning of treatment. After 24 h, thymidine incorporation was measured using a scintillation counter. The methylene blue staining method was performed as described previously (25.Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J.

Matrigel (Collaborative Biomolecules) was added (320 μl) to each well of a 24-well plate and allowed to polymerize. A suspension of 25,000 MAE cells in EGM-2 without antibiotics was seeded into each well. The cells were treated with either tumstatin, BSA, or the 7 S domain of a α3 chain of human type IV collagen. The 7 S domain was extracted from human placenta basement membrane. Control cells were incubated with sterile PBS. Cells were incubated for 24–48 h at 37 °C and viewed using a CK2 Olympus microscope (magnification of × 3.3 ocular, × 10 objective). The cells were then photographed using 400 DK-coated TMAX film (Kodak). Cells were stained with diff-quik fixative (Sigma) and photographed again (33.Grant D.S. Kibbey M.C. Kinsella J.L. Cid M.C. Kleinman H.K. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1994; 190: 854-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Ten fields were viewed, and the number of tubes was counted by two investigators blinded for the experimental protocols and averaged. Annexin V, a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein with a high affinity for phosphatidylserine was used to detect apoptosis (34.van Engeland M. Nieland L.J. Ramaekers F.C. Schutte B. Reutelingsperger C.P. Cytometry. 1998; 31: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). This assay was performed as described previously (25.Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H.

CPAE cells (0.5 × 106/well) were seeded onto a 6-well plate in 10% FCS-supplemented DMEM. On the next day the fresh medium containing 10% FCS was added together with tumstatin ranging from 0.02 to 20 μg/ml or 80 ng/ml TNF-α. Control cells received an equal volume of PBS. After 18 h of treatment, medium containing floating cells was collected, and attached cells were trypsinized and centrifuged together with floating cells at 3000 × g. The cells were then washed in PBS and resuspended in binding buffer (10 mmHEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmCaCl2). Annexin V-FITC (CLONTECH) was added to a final concentration of 150 ng/ml, and the cells were incubated in the darkness for 10 min. The cells were washed again in PBS and resuspended in binding buffer. Annexin V-FITC-labeled cells were counted using a Becton-Dickinson FACStar plus flow cytometer. For each treatment 15,000 cells were counted and stored in listmode. These data were then analyzed using Cell Quest software (Becton-Dickinson). Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide assay, as described previously (35.Sugiyama H. Kashihara N. Maeshima Y. Okamoto K. Kanao K. Sekikawa T. Makino H. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1188-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). C-PAE cells (7000 cells/well) were plated to a 96-well plate in 10% FCS containing DMEM. The next day a varying concentration of tumstatin or deletion mutants was added and incubated for 24 h, and cell viability was evaluated. TNF-α (80 ng/ml) was used as a positive control. CPAE cells (0.5 × 106/well) were plated in 10-cm Petri dishes precoated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) onto a 6-well plate in 10% FCS-supplemented DMEM overnight. On the next day, medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2% FCS and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Then cells were stimulated with basic fibroblast growth factor (3 ng/ml) in DMEM (2% FCS) also containing tumstatin (10 μg/ml) or deletion mutants (5 μg/ml) and incubated for 24 h. Controls received PBS buffer. TNF-α (80 ng/ml) was used as a positive control. After 24 h, the supernatant cells were collected, and attached cells were trypsinized and combined with the supernatant cells. Cells were counted and resuspended in cell lysis buffer (CLONTECH) at a concentration of 4 × 107 cells/ml. The rest of the protocol followed the manufacturer's instruction (CLONTECH). A specific inhibitor of caspase-3, DEVD-fmk, was used to confirm the specificity of the assay. The absorbance was measured in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at 405 nm. Similarly nonendothelial cells (PC-3) were used and analyzed. This assay was repeated three times. Five- to six-week-old male C57/BL6 mice (The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were obtained. All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the animal care and use committee of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and are in accordance with the guidelines of the Department of Health and Human Services. Before injection into mice, matrigel (Collaborative Biomolecules) was mixed with 20 units/ml heparin (Pierce), 150 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (R&D), and 1 μg/ml tumstatin (E. coli-produced, soluble). Control groups received no angiogenic inhibitor. The matrigel mixture was injected subcutane"
https://openalex.org/W2077038946,"Osteopontin (OPN) is a non-collagenous, glycosylated phosphoprotein associated with biomineralization in osseous tissues, as well as ectopic calcification. We previously reported that osteopontin was co-localized with calcified deposits in atherosclerotic lesions, and that osteopontin potently inhibits calcium deposition in a human smooth muscle cell (HSMC) culture model of vascular calcification. In this report, the role of phosphorylation in osteopontin's mineralization inhibitory function was examined. The ability of OPN to inhibit calcification completely depended on post-translational modifications, since bacteria-derived recombinant OPN did not inhibit HSMC mineralization. Following casein kinase II treatment, phosphorylated OPN (P-OPN) dose-dependently inhibited calcification of HSMC cultured in vitro about as effectively as native OPN. The inhibitory effect of osteopontin depended on the extent of phosphorylation. To determine the specific structural domains of OPN important for inhibition of calcification, we compared OPN fragments (N-terminal, C-terminal, and full-length), and compared the inhibitory effect of both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated fragments. While none of the non-phosphorylated OPN fragments effected calcification, P-OPN caused dose dependent inhibition of HSMC calcification. P-OPN was treated with alkaline phosphatase to create dephosphorylated OPN. Dephosphorylated OPN did not have an inhibitory effect on calcification. The expression of OPN mRNA and P-OPN secretion by HSMC were decreased in a time-dependent manner during culture calcification. These results indicate that phosphorylation is required for the inhibitory effect of OPN on HSMC calcification, and that regulation of OPN phosphorylation represents one way in which mineralization may be controlled by cells.

Lansing A.I. Wheeler P.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1944; 20: 665-687PubMed Google Scholar). In diabetic patients and individuals with renal failure, vascular calcification contributes to both the morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases (2.Frink R.J. Achor R.W. Brown A.J. Kincaid O.W. Brandenburg R.O. Am. J. Cardiol. 1970; 26: 241-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For example, vascular calcification is positively correlated with increased risk of myocardial infarction and increased risk of dissection following angioplasty (3.Fitzgerald P.J. Ports T.A. Yock P.G. Circulation. 1992; 86: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Moreover, calcification is a major cause of failure for both native and tissue prosthetic heart valves, affecting 1–2% of the aging population (4.Loecker T.H. Schwartz R.S. Cotta C.W. Hickman J.J. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1992; 19: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Until recently, vascular calcification was considered to be a passive, degenerative, and end-stage process of vascular disease. However, bone morphogenetic proteins including bone morphogenetic proteins-2, and noncollagenous bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin, osteonectin, osteocalcin, and matrix Gla protein have been demonstrated in calcified vascular tissues (5.Tanimura A.

In addition, vascular cell calcificationin vitro was regulated by calcitropic hormones such as parathyroid hormone-related peptide (9.Jono S. Nishizawa Y. Shioi A. Morii H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and vitamin D (10.Jono S. Nishizawa Y. Shioi A. Morii H. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1302-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), as well as lipid oxidation products (11.Parhami F. Morrow A.D. Balucan J. Leitninger N. Watson A.D. Tintut Y. Berliner J.A. Demer L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the process of vascular calcification may share some mechanisms with mineralization seen in bone, cartilage, and teeth, and that vascular calcification is in fact an actively regulated process. OPN1 is a secreted, glycosylated phosphoprotein found normally in mineralized tissues such as bones and teeth, in addition to kidney, urine, and epithelial lining cells of numerous organs. OPN is associated with calcified deposits in soft tissues, such as Monckeberg's sclerosis, aortic stenosis, prosthetic valves, renal stones, and tumor-associated calcifications. We and others have reported that OPN is abundant at sites of calcification in atherosclerotic plaques and in calcified aortic valves (7.Giachelli C.M. Bae N. Almeida M. Denhardt D.T. Alpers C.E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24871-24878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OPN can exist in multiple forms depending on the extent of post-translational modification. In addition to sulfation (16.Nagata T. Todescan R. Goldberg H.A. Zhang Q. Sodek J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), glycosylation (17.Sorensen E.S. Hojrup P. Petersen T.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2040-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and transglutamination (18.Beninati S. Senger D.R. Cordella-Miele E. Mukerjee A.B. Chakalaparampil M. Shanjugan V. Singh K. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), osteopontin can undergo extensive phosphorylation. A highly phosphorylated form of OPN can be isolated from the mineralized extracellular matrix of bone tissue (19.Prince C.W. Oosawa T. Butler W.T. Tomana M. Bhown A.S. Bhown M. Scrohenloher R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 262: 2900-2907Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and is synthesized by osteoblasts (20.Gerstenfeld L.C. Lian J.B. Gotoh Y. Lee D.D. Landis W.J. McKee M.D. Nanci A. Glimcher M.J.

Commun. 1994; 198: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In some cells, OPN phosphorylation is highly regulated. For example, normal rat kidney cells as well as smooth muscle cells secrete both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated OPN (23.Singh K. DeVouge M.W. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18696-18701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Giachelli C.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 760: 109-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Likewise, JB6 epidermal cells treated with phorbol esters secrete phosphorylated OPN while JB6 cells treated with vitamin D3 secrete non-phosphorylated OPN (25.Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2144-2150PubMed Google Scholar). While an extensive tissue survey has yet to be performed, it is likely that tissue-specific expression of OPN differs not only in protein levels but phosphorylation state. Such differences in the extent of phosphorylation of OPN may be important in OPN's physiological function, in particular, in the formation of mineralized tissues. Previously we reported that native smooth muscle derived-OPN inhibited calcium deposition in a bovine smooth muscle cell calcification system, and that OPN was localized to the surface of calcified deposits (26.Wada T. McKee M.D. Steitz S. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role of phosphorylation in OPN's ability to inhibit calcification in vitro. We found that bacterial-derived recombinant OPN (reOPN) containing no post-translational modifications did not inhibit HSMC mineralization, while native OPN derived from rat neonatal smooth muscle cells inhibited HFSMC culture calcification. The ability of OPN to inhibit mineralization could be restored to reOPN using casein kinase II (CKII) to generate phosphorylated OPN (P-OPN). P-OPN dose dependently inhibited calcification and was about as effective as native OPN. The inhibitory effect of osteopontin on HSMC culture calcification was strictly dependent on the number of phosphorylated sites. Moreover, phosphorylated OPN treated with alkaline phosphatase to generate dephosphorylated OPN did not inhibit HSMC culture calcification. Finally, both the expression of endogenous OPN mRNA and phosphorylated OPN secretion decreased in a time-dependent manner during HSMC culture calcification. These results indicated that phosphorylation of OPN is required for its inhibitory effects on HSMC biomineralization, and that this is an actively regulated process in HSMC probably contributing to the propensity of the cultures to calcify. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, 4.5 g/liter of glucose) (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Casein kinase II was purchased from Calbiochem (LA Jolla, CA). H3[32P]O4, [γ-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]dCTP were obtained from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). Unless otherwise mentioned, all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Native OPN was purified from the conditioned medium of rat neonatal smooth muscle cell cultures as described previously (29.Kiefer M.C. Bauer D.M. Barr P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This preparation was judged to be >95% pure, on the basis of Coomassie staining and N-terminal sequence analysis. Goat anti-rat osteopontin antibody OP-199 and non-immune goat serum were prepared, and IgG fractions were purified as described previously (27.Liaw L. Almeida M. Hart C.E. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Full-length human reOPN was generated as described previously (27.Liaw L. Almeida M. Hart C.E. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). An expression plasmid containing histidine-tagged protein was generated by cloning a polymerase chain reaction fragment containing the full-length splice variant of human OPN (OPN10), amino acid residues 1–317, into theBamHI site of vector pQE30 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).Escherichia coli transformed with the His-OPN plasmid was grown in LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C to express the histidine-tagged protein. The reOPN was purified from bacterial cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (QIA expression kit, Qiagen), chromatographed on Ni2+-nitrilotriaacetic acid resin, and eluted with 0.2m imidazole. The purified reOPN was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Osteopontin N- and C-terminal proteins were generated by thrombin cleavage of bacterially expressed GST-OPN fusion proteins. Expression plasmids containing GST-OPN were generated by cloning polymerase chain reaction-amplified N-terminal (amino acid residues 17–169) and C-terminal (amino acid residues 170–317) osteopontin fragments intoBamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The N-terminal 10N and 30N fragments were amplified from cDNAs encoding two different splice forms of OPN, OP10, and OP30, respectively. The 30N fragment is identical to the 10N fragment except that it includes the alternate splice exon 5 (amino acid residues 59–72). The C-terminal 10C fragment was amplified from OP10. The plasmid OP10 was provided by Dr. Larry Fisher (28.Young M.F. Kerr J.M. Termine J.D. Wewer U.M. Wang M.G. McBride O.W. Fisher L.W. Genomics. 1990; 7: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). OP30 was obtained from ATCC (29.Kiefer M.C. Bauer D.M. Barr P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The GST-OPN fusion constructs were DNA sequence verified. E. coli JM109 cells transformed with these GST-OPN plasmids were grown in LB with 150 μg/ml ampicillin and then induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C to express the fusion proteins. The GST-OPN fusion proteins were purified basically according to the manufacturer's instructions (GST gene fusion system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The OPN N- or C-terminal fragments were separated from GST-bound beads by treating with 0.1 unit of biotinylated thrombin/μg of GST-OPN (Novagen, Madison, WI) for 2 h. The cleavage reaction was stopped with biotinylated-PPACK (400 ng/unit of biotinylated thrombin). Supernatants were collected and biotinylated thrombin and PPACK were removed by incubation with streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) and separation of beads from supernatant. HSMC were obtained by enzymatic digestion as described previously (30.Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 172-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Briefly, medial tissues were separated from segments of human fetal aorta obtained at autopsy. Small pieces of tissue (1 to 2 mm3) were digested overnight in DMEM supplemented with 165 units/ml collagenase type I, 15 units/ml elastase type III, and 0.375 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor at 37 °C. Single cell suspensions were placed in 6-well plates and cultured for several weeks in DMEM supplemented with 20% FCS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cultures which formed colonies were collected at confluence and maintained in growth medium (DMEM containing 15% FBS and 1 mm sodium pyruvate supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin; final inorganic phosphate concentration = 1.4 mm). Purity of cultures was assessed by positive immunostaining for α-SM actin and calponin, and absence of von Willebrand factor staining as described previously (30.Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 172-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). HSMC up to passage 8 were used for these experiments. HSMCs were routinely subcultured in growth medium. At confluence, the cells were switched to calcification medium (DMEM containing 15% FBS in the presence of 2 mm inorganic phosphate (unless otherwise stated) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) for up to 14 days. The medium was replaced with fresh medium every 2 days. For time course experiments, the first day of culture in calcification medium was defined as day 0. Cells were decalcified with 0.6 n HCl for 24 h. The calcium content of HCl supernatants was determined colorimetrically by theo-cresolphthalein complexone method (Calcium Kit; Sigma) as described previously (9.Jono S. Nishizawa Y. Shioi A. Morii H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After decalcification, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with 0.1n NaOH, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The protein content was measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The calcium content of the cell layer was normalized to protein content. The reOPNs (10 μg) were phosphorylated in the presence of 0.3 mm ATP with or without [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 1 μCi/mmol) and 100 ng of CKII in 100 μl of assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 15 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2). At various times during the reaction, incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into proteins was monitored by spotting 1 μg of proteins on glasswool, followed by washing with 5% trichloroacetic acid to remove unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP and counting incorporated 32P in 5 ml of liquid scintillant. Incorporation of 32P into proteins was evaluated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, and radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Western blot confirmed that the isolated protein was OPN. Total RNA was isolated from HSMCs by extraction with Trizol as suggested by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty micrograms of total RNA were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde, and transferred to a nylon filter (Zeta-Probe GT, Bio-Rad). Blots were prehybridized at 42 °C for 1 h in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 0.75 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, 20 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 1× Denhardt's solution and then hybridized at 42 °C for 24 h with cDNA probe for human OPN which was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/ml; NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA) by use of a random priming method (Megaprime cDNA labeling system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were washed and autoradiographed with x-ray film at −70 °C. The amounts of RNA were quantified by densitometric scanning and normalized by comparison with GAPDH. 5 μg of P-OPN was dephosphorylated in the presence of 2 units of alkaline phosphatase in 50 mm HEPES (pH 10), 1 mm MgCl2 for up to 24 h at 37 °C. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, and radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. HSMCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS until confluent and then switched to calcification medium containing 2 mm phosphate. HSMC were grown in the calcification medium for 10 days to promote mineralization. To detect phosphorylated OPN, HSMC were incubated in phosphate-free DMEM for 30 min, followed by incubation in phosphate-free DMEM (1 ml/dish) containing [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi of 32P/dish) for 6 h. After 6 h incubation, the medium was carefully collected. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-OPN antibody (OP-199) or a goat IgG as a negative control at 4 °C. Immune complexes were recovered by binding to protein A-Sepharose and washing five times with IP wash buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The immunoprecipitated proteins were suspended in 20 μl of sample buffer (0.07 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, and radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Western blot confirmed that the isolated protein was OPN. Data were analyzed for statistical significance by ANOVA with post-hoc Scheffe's F analysis, unless otherwise stated. These analyses were performed with the assistance of a computer program (StatView version 4.11, Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). We have developed an in vitro model for human vascular calcification. In this system elevating inorganic phosphate to the hyperphosphatemic range (2 mm) induced matrix calcification. We first examined the effect of native smooth muscle cell-derived OPN (native OPN) on HSMC calcification. Native OPN was previously shown to be both phosphorylated and glycosylated (24.Giachelli C.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 760: 109-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Native OPN inhibited HSMC calcification in a dose-dependent manner (calcified control (vehicle-treated cells) versus 15 nm native OPN-treated cells: 153.4 ± 27.1versus 62.7 ± 4.8 (μg/mg protein), mean ± S.D. (n = 3)) (Fig.1 A). This finding was consistent with previous studies showing that native OPN inhibited bovine smooth muscle cell calcification (26.Wada T. McKee M.D. Steitz S. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of bacterial-derived rat and human reOPNs on HSMC calcification. In contrast to native OPN, both rat and human reOPNs dose dependently promoted calcification (calcified control (vehicle-treated cells)versus 15 nm rat reOPN-treated cells: 153.4 ± 27.1 versus 244.6 ± 31.5 (μg/mg of protein), mean ± S.D. (n = 3)) (calcified control (vehicle-treated cells) versus 15 nm human reOPN-treated cells: 153.4 ± 27.1 versus 254.4 ± 14.9 (μg/mg protein), mean ± S.D. (n = 3)) (Fig. 1, B and C). Since the bacterial products contain neither phosphorylation nor glycosylation, these data suggested that the ability of OPN to inhibit calcification was dependent on post-translational modification. In order to compare the bioactivity of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated OPN, human reOPN was phosphorylated with CKII. CKII phosphorylated OPN in a time-dependent manner for up to 90 min (Fig. 2). A mean molar ratio of phosphate:OPN of approximately 20 was achieved (TableI). This is in good agreement with the number of putative CKII phosphorylation sites found in the human OPN sequence (23.Singh K. DeVouge M.W. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18696-18701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIncorporated phosphate per mole of OPNOPNMol of phosphate/mol of OPNFull-length20.0 ± 0.430N12.1 ± 0.410N9.7 ± 0.310C8.6 ± 0.4Phosphorylation was performed by incubation of 10 μg of human recombinant OPN with CKII for 90 min as described under “Materials and Methods.” Incorporation of 32P into proteins was evaluated by spotting 1 μg of proteins on glasswool, followed by washing with 5% trichloroacetic acid to remove unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP and counting incorporated 32P in 5 ml of liquid scintillant.

Open table in a new tab Phosphorylation was performed by incubation of 10 μg of human recombinant OPN with CKII for 90 min as described under “Materials and Methods.” Incorporation of 32P into proteins was evaluated by spotting 1 μg of proteins on glasswool, followed by washing with 5% trichloroacetic acid to remove unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP and counting incorporated 32P in 5 ml of liquid scintillant. The data indicate mean molar ratio of phosphate:OPN and are presented as mean ± S.D., n= 3. We next examined the effect of P-OPN on HSMC calcification. P-OPN inhibited calcification in a dose-dependent manner, and at 75 nm P-OPN, calcium deposition decreased to 31% of control cultures (calcified control (vehicle-treated cells)versus 75 nm phosphorylated OPN-treated cells: 142.2 ± 2.5 versus 42.8 ± 5.0 μg/mg of protein, mean ± S.D. (n = 3)) (Fig.3 A). To determine whether the extent of OPN phosphorylation effected its inhibitory potential, we prepared differentially phosphorylated OPNs by incubating reOPN with CKII for limiting periods of times. OPN was phosphorylated with CKII for times ranging from 5 to 90 min. As shown in Fig. 3 B, P-OPN inhibited calcification in proportion to the extent of phosphorylation (calcified control vehicle-treated cellsversus 15 nm OPN phosphorylated with CK II for 90 min-treated cells: 169.6 ± 1.5 versus 73.8 ± 7.9 μg/mg of protein, mean ± S.D. (n = 3)) (Fig. 3 B). To identify the specific phosphorylated domain of OPN important for inhibition of calcification, we made use of reOPN N- and C-terminal fragments. These fragments represent the fragments that result from thrombin cleavage of osteopontin at serine 169. The N-terminal fragment contains amino acids 1–169 and the C-terminal fragment contains amino acids 170–317 of human OPN. In addition, two different N-terminal fragments were prepared, 10N and 30N, representing two alternative splice variants described for human OPN (28.Young M.F. Kerr J.M. Termine J.D. Wewer U.M. Wang M.G. McBride O.W. Fisher L.W. Genomics. 1990; 7: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 29.Kiefer M.C. Bauer D.M. Barr P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The 10N fragment differs from the 30N fragment by deletion of exon 5. This exon encodes 14 amino acids including potential sites for phosphorylation (28.Young M.F. Kerr J.M. Termine J.D. Wewer U.M. Wang M.G. McBride O.W. Fisher L.W. Genomics. 1990; 7: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 29.Kiefer M.C. Bauer D.M. Barr P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Each fragment was phosphorylated by incubating with CKII for 90 min. As shown in Table I, mean molar ratios of phosphate:30N-terminal, 10N-terminal, 10C-terminal OPN fragments of 12.1, 9.7, and 8.6, respectively, were achieved. The slightly lower level of phosphorylation of the 10N fragment compared with the 30N fragment is likely due to the extra phosphorylation sites present in the 30N fragment that contains exon 5 (29.Kiefer M.C. Bauer D.M. Barr P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The effect of N-terminal and C-terminal P-OPN fragments on HSMC calcification was then investigated. Whereas nonphosphorylated OPN fragments did not significantly decrease calcification, all phosphorylated OPN fragments potently inhibited calcification (calcified control (vehicle-treated cells)versus 15 nm phosphorylated OPN (full-length)versus 15 nm phosphorylated 30N-OPNversus 15 nm phosphorylated 10N-OPNversus 15 nm phosphorylated 10C-OPN-treated cells: 145.0 ± 10.2 versus 27.3 ± 3.1versus 25.8 ± 0.6 versus 27.6 ± 3.5versus 20.6 ± 0.6 μg/mg protein, mean ± S.D. (n = 3)) (Fig.4 A). These data suggested that the organization of phosphate groups guided by OPN primary structure in both the N- and C-terminal fragments were most critical for anticalcification properties of OPN. Furthermore, these data indicate that anticalcification properties of OPN are RGD-independent in thisin vitro model system. This is consistent with previous observations that OPN's ability to bind and block hydroxyapatite crystal growth most likely explains its ability to inhibit biomineralization in vitro (26.Wada T. McKee M.D. Steitz S. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 31.Boskey A.L. Maresca M. Ullrich W. Doty S.B. Butler W.T. Prince C.W. Bone Miner. 1993; 22: 147-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of alkaline phosphatase on OPN's ability to inhibit HSMC calcification. P-OPN was dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase treatment as confirmed by 10% SDS-PAGE (Fig.5 A) with no loss of osteopontin protein (Fig. 5 B). Although P-OPN inhibited calcification, after treatment with alkaline phosphatase, calcium deposition was restored (calcified control (vehicle-treated cells)versus recombinant OPN versus phosphorylated OPNversus dephosphorylated OPN-treated cells: 147.3 ± 9.6versus 172.5 ± 5.8 versus 44.6 ± 5.2versus 162.4 ± 10.4 μg/mg of protein, mean ± S.D. (n = 3)) (Fig. 5 C). These data suggested that alkaline phosphatase could be a physiological regulator of OPN's anticalcification activity. Finally, we examined the expression and phosphorylation state of endogenous OPN during in vitro calcification of HSMC cultures by Northern blot analysis. A 1.6-kilobase OPN mRNA was detected in both calcified and non-calcified HSMC. The expression of OPN mRNA was clearly decreased during the calcification process (Fig. 6). To determine the phosphorylation state of OPN during culture calcification, HSMC were metabolically labeled by the addition of [32P]orthophosphate to the culture medium. The labeled osteopontin in the medium was immunoprecipitated and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. While a strong band corresponding to phosphorylated OPN was visualized in non-calcifying HSMC, no phosphorylated OPN was detected calcifying HSMC (Fig.7 A). This was not due to the inability of the antibody to detect non-phosphorylated OPN since Western blot analysis indicated that OPN protein was present in both noncalcified and calcified HSMC culture supernatants (Fig.7 B). Consistent with the mRNA data, somewhat less OPN was detected in calcified versus noncalcified cultures. These data suggest that decreased synthesis and secretion of phosphorylated OPN may contribute to calcification of HSMC under the conditions used in this study.Figure 7Immunoprecipitation of OPN during HSMC calcification. Confluent HSMCs were cultured in calcification medium (+) or growth medium (−) for 10 days. HSMCs were incubated in phosphate-free DMEM (1 ml/dish) containing [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi of 32P/dish) for 6 h. After 6 h incubation, the medium were carefully collected and immunoprecipitated with the anti-rat OPN antibody or a goat IgG as a negative control at 4 °C. Immune complexes were recovered by binding to protein A-Sepharose and washing five times with IP wash buffer. All samples were evaluated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, transferred the membrane, and detected by autoradiography (upper panel). Western blot analysis confirmed that the protein isolated by immunoprecipitation from HSMC was osteopontin (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we have demonstrated that the ability of OPN to inhibit calcification of HSMC cultures is dependent on post-translational modification. Although bacteria-derived reOPN did not inhibit HSMC culture mineralization, rat native OPN showed strong anticalcification activity. We found that reOPN phosphorylated by CKII dose dependently inhibited calcification. Inhibition of calcification was proportional to the number of phosphorylated sites in OPN. While nonphosphorylated N-terminal and C-terminal reOPN fragments did not effect HSMC culture calcification, phosphorylated versions of these fragments strongly inhibited HSMC calcification. Furthermore, OPN dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase did not have an inhibitory effect on HSMC culture calcification. Finally, the expression of OPN mRNA, secretion of protein, and fraction of phosphorylated osteopontin decreased during calcification. These results indicate that phosphorylation of OPN is required for its inhibitory effect on HSMC culture calcification. We previously found that the major mineral deposited in bovine smooth muscle cell cultures was hydroxyapatite (HA) (26.Wada T. McKee M.D. Steitz S. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). OPN has a high affinity for HA (31.Boskey A.L. Maresca M. Ullrich W. Doty S.B. Butler W.T. Prince C.W. Bone Miner. 1993; 22: 147-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and was previously shown to inhibit de novo HA formation in both metastable calcium phosphate solutions, and steady state agarose (32.Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 90: 175-179Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and gelatin (33.Salih E. Ashkar S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1461-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) gels. In contrast, OPN showed no ability to nucleate HA (32.Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 90: 175-179Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, native OPN inhibited calcification of both human (present study) and bovine smooth muscle cell cultures (26.Wada T. McKee M.D. Steitz S. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and was shown by immunogold electron microscopy to bind to growing hydroxyapatite crystals within the extracellular matrix (26.Wada T. McKee M.D. Steitz S. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the ability of OPN to bind to HA and block crystal formation underlies its potent effect on vascular smooth muscle calcification in vitro. OPN is highly anionic due to its elevated content of the acidic amino acid, aspartate, and its high degree of phosphorylation. The primary structure of OPN contains over 20 potential phosphorylation sites for various protein kinases (28.Young M.F. Kerr J.M. Termine J.D. Wewer U.M. Wang M.G. McBride O.W. Fisher L.W. Genomics. 1990; 7: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 29.Kiefer M.C. Bauer D.M. Barr P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Not all of these sites appear to be utilized, however, since it has been reported that rat bone OPN contains 12 phosphoserines and 1 phosphothreonine (19.Prince C.W. Oosawa T. Butler W.T. Tomana M. Bhown A.S. Bhown M. Scrohenloher R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 262: 2900-2907Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), bovine milk OPN contains 27 phosphoserines and 1 phosphothreonine (17.Sorensen E.S. Hojrup P. Petersen T.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2040-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and chicken osteoblast OPN contained 7 phosphoserine and 1 phosphothreonine (33.Salih E. Ashkar S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1461-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The majority of the phosphorylations occur on serines within consensus phosphorylation motifs for casein kinases such as mammary gland Golgi casein kinase and CKII (34.Salih E. Ashkar S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13966-13973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Indeed, in purified systems, CKII was the predominant enzyme capable of phosphorylating chicken OPN (35.Salih E. Ashkar S. Zhou H.Y. Gerstenfeld L. Glimcher M.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and Golgi kinase had strong activity toward rat recombinant OPN (36.Lasa M. Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Pinna L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Consistent with those findings, human recombinant OPN was phosphorylated with CKII and a mean molar ratio of phosphate:OPN of 20 was achieved in the present studies. Which of these enzymes phosphorylates OPN in vivo, however, is still controversial. Our studies indicate that the presence of phosphorylated residues is particularly important for OPN's anticalcification effects in HSMC cultures. We found that bacterial-derived recombinant OPN, devoid of any post-translational modification, did not inhibit HSMC culture calcification, and on the contrary, showed a slight stimulatory effect. However, following phosphorylation with CKII, bacterial OPN was as potent as native OPN in inhibiting HSMC calcification. Furthermore, the anticalcific potency of OPN depended on the extent of phosphorylation, with minimal inhibition occurring unless >9 mol of phosphate were incorporated per mole of osteopontin. While the precise sites of phosphorylation in our CKII-treated bacterial OPN have not yet been identified, these data suggest that either specific phosphorylated sequences or arrangement of phosphorylated sequences is required for OPN function in anticalcification. In addition, dephosphorylation of P-reOPN with alkaline phosphatase completely inhibited calcification inhibitory activity. These studies are consistent with previous observations in cell-free systems, showing that treatment of OPN with alkaline phosphatase removed 84% of the covalently bound phosphate and reduced HA inhibiting activity by more than 40-fold (37.Hunter G.K. Lawrence K. Goldberg H.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation has also been suggested to regulate the cell binding activity of OPN. In one study, partial dephosphorylation of bovine OPN by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase resulted in decreased osteoclast binding (38.Ek-Rylander B. Flores M. Wendel M. Heinegard D. Andersson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14853-14856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, CKII treatment of recombinant rat OPN enhanced osteoclast adhesion, even though only low mean molar ratio of phosphate:OPN of approximately 1.5 was achieved (39.Katayama Y. House C.M. Udagawa N. Kazama J.J. McFarland R.J. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The present studies are the first to use defined OPN peptide fragments to examine sequences important for OPN's calcification inhibitory activity. The data indicate that OPN's inhibitory activity on HSMC calcification is independent of the RGD sequence and polyaspartic acid domain since a fragment lacking both the RGD and polyaspartate sequences (10C) exhibited inhibitory potency equivalent to fragments which contained both domains (30N and 10N). This was somewhat unexpected, since previous studies in a cell-free system showed that poly-l-aspartic acid was nearly as potent as bone-derived OPN in inhibiting HA formation (37.Hunter G.K. Lawrence K. Goldberg H.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). One explanation of this discrepancy is that the calcium binding properties of OPN may be more important in inhibiting HA formation in cell-free systems than in our cell culture system, since the polyaspartic acid sequence and both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of OPN have been shown to bind calcium with specificity (40.Singh K. Deonarine D. Shanmugam V. Senger D.R. Mukherjee A.B. Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Finally, to determine whether regulation of OPN phosphorylation might occur during the development of HSMC culture mineralization, we examined endogenous OPN mRNA, OPN protein, and phosphorylated OPN levels with time in mineralizing cultures. Our data indicate that OPN mRNA levels and total as well as phosphorylated OPN protein levels decline as HSMC cultures calcify. Thus OPN synthesis as well as phosphorylation are inversely correlated with tissue culture mineralization. Our findings suggest that regulation of phosphorylation state may be a common mechanism controlling OPN's functional activities. Several recent studies support this notion. Normal rat kidney cells secrete both the phosphorylated (pp69) and non-phosphorylated (np69) form of OPN. pp69 is cell surface-associated, whereas np69 is not. On the other hand, np69 can form a heat-dissociable complex with fibronectin, while pp69 cannot (23.Singh K. DeVouge M.W. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18696-18701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, phorbol ester stimulation of P-OPN in JB6 epidermal cells was correlated with tumorigenic morphological changes and anchorage independent growth. On the other hand, calcitriol stimulated synthesis and secretion of nonphosphorylated OPN in JB6 cells, and these transformed cells lacked the tumorigenic properties observed in phorbol ester-treated cells (25.Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2144-2150PubMed Google Scholar). These observations, combined with our studies, suggest that phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of OPN have different functional properties. Identification of mechanisms controlling OPN phosphorylation state is thus of paramount interest in future studies."

After translocation of the precursor protein to the periplasm the signal peptides are normally removed by the enzyme signal peptidase. The majority of periplasmic proteins are exported via the Sec apparatus. A major feature of the Sec apparatus is that proteins are translocated in an extended conformation and are often bound by SecB or other cytoplasmic chaperones to prevent folding prior to export (1.Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 59-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 3.Fekkes P. Driessen A.J.M.

Although conserved amino acid sequences are absent, Sec signal peptides possess a common tripartite structural organization comprising a positively charged amino-terminal (n-)1 region, a central hydrophobic (h-) region with a high propensity for α-helix formation, and a carboxyl-terminal (c-) region that carries the cleavage site for the signal peptidase (4.von Heijne G.

Remarkably and uniquely this translocase functions to transport folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane, a feat that must be achieved without rendering the membrane freely permeable to protons and other ions. The thylakoid membrane of plant chloroplasts contains protein transport systems homologous to both the Sec and Tat pathways of bacteria (15.Keegstra K. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Targeting to the Tat-analogous thylakoid ΔpH-dependent transport pathway is, like its bacterial counterpart, mediated by signal peptides (“transfer peptides” or “lumen-targeting domains”) with paired arginine residues (16.Chaddock A.M. Mant A. Karnauchov I. Brink S. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and indeed bacterial Tat signal peptides have been shown to direct efficient thylakoid import specifically by the ΔpH-dependent system (17.Mori H. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11405-11408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18.Wexler M. Bogsch E.G. Klösgen R.B. Palmer T. Robinson C. Berks B.C.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) the signal peptide alone is capable of mediating mutually exclusive sorting of precursor proteins between the Tat and Sec pathways. Thus, even though they conform to the tripartite structure of Sec signal peptides, Tat signal peptides avoid functional interactions with the Sec apparatus. Recent studies in bacteria suggest that the low h-region hydrophobicity of Tat signal peptides relative to that of Sec signal peptides is the major structural feature precluding targeting of Tat substrates to the Sec pathway (6.Cristóbal S. de Gier J.-W. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2982-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and the same mechanism may apply in chloroplasts (23.Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, basic residues commonly found in the c-region of bacterial and thylakoid Tat signal peptides, but characteristically absent from the c-region of Sec signal peptides, have been shown in thylakoids to operate as a “Sec-avoidance” determinant (24.Bogsch E.G. Brink S. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A similar function is likely for these residues in bacterial Tat signal peptides given the longstanding observations that introduction of positive charges in the vicinity of the leader peptidase site slows transport of Sec-targeted precursors (e.g. Refs. 6.Cristóbal S. de Gier J.-W. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2982-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar and 25.Li P. Beckwith J. Inouye H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7685-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Targeting to the Tat apparatus in chloroplasts exhibits an absolute dependence on the invariant twin arginine pair within the signal peptide (16.Chaddock A.M. Mant A. Karnauchov I. Brink S. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 23.Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Studies with bacterial Tat signal peptides suggest that the twin arginine residues are also important in targeting to the bacterial Tat pathway (6.Cristóbal S. de Gier J.-W. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2982-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 26.Nivière V. Wong S.-L. Voordouw G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2173-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27.Dreusch A. Burgisser D.M. Heizmann C.W. Zumft W.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28.Gross R. Simon J. Kröger A. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 172: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29.Halbig D. Wiegert T. Blaudeck N. Freudl R. Sprenger G.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, a major difference between bacterial and plant Tat signal peptides is that the bacterial signal peptides contain additional conserved amino acids surrounding the paired arginines. A consensus for this extended twin arginine motif has been defined as SRRXFLK where the arginine residues are invariant, and the frequency of occurrence of the other amino acids exceeds 50% (7.Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The observation of an extended n-region motif immediately raises the question of the role and importance of the non-arginine consensus residues in the bacterial Tat transport process. A further obvious question is whether these additional potential targeting determinants reduce the importance of the arginine pair that is essential for thylakoid Tat transport. In an attempt to address these questions we have undertaken a systematic site-directed mutagenesis study of the extended bacterial Tat consensus motif and assessed the effect of these signal peptide alterations on protein export. In addition, we have investigated the importance of the c-region charge in targeting to the bacterial Tat apparatus. Strain BUDDY (MC4100 ΔtatC::ΩSpecR) was constructed as follows. The interposon fragment carrying the spectinomycin/streptomycin resistance gene from pHP45 (30.Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar) was subcloned following EcoRI digestion into plasmid pFAT23, which carries an in-frame deletion in the tatC gene (13.Bogsch E.G. Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Robinson C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18003-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid, pFAT25, was digested with XbaI andKpnI and the marked deletion allele of tatCcloned into the polylinker of pMAK705 (31.Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to give plasmid pFAT27. The marked deletion allele of tatC was subsequently recombined into the chromosome of MC4100 (F− ΔlacU169 araD139 rpsL150 relA1 ptsF rbs flbB5301) (32.Casadaban M.J. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4530-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) as described (31.Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain NRS-1 was constructed by P1 transduction (33.Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar), of thetatC::ΩSpecR allele into K38, (HfrC phoA4 pit-10 tonA22 ompF 627 relA1 spoT1 l +) (34.Lyons L.B. Zinder N.D. Virology. 1972; 49: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). During all genetic manipulations E. coli strains were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani medium (35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Concentrations of antibiotics were as described previously (12.Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Plasmids for the in vivosynthesis of pre-SufI and pre-YacK were constructed as follows. A 1,430-base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment covering the region from 18 nucleotides upstream of the start codon of sufI, including the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, to the stop codon was amplified using the primers 5′-GCGCGAATTCGTTTTACATGGAGCAAATATG-3′ and 5′-GC GCTCTAGATTACGGTACCGGATTGACC-3′ with MC4100 chromosomal DNA as the template. The product was digested with EcoRI andXbaI and cloned into the polylinker of pT7.5 (36.Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar) to give plasmid pNR14, which was used as the template for all subsequent mutations in the signal peptide coding portion of sufI. A 1,464-base pair DNA fragment covering the region from 16 nucleotides upstream of the start codon of yacK to the stop codon was amplified from MC4100 chromosomal DNA using the primers 5′-GCGCGAATTCGAATAAGGAAATAACTATG-3′ and 5′-GCGCTCTAGATTATACCGTAAACCCTAAC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with EcoRI and XbaI and cloned into the polylinker of pT7.5 to give the construct pNR19, which was used as the template for the introduction of mutations into the signal peptide-coding portion of yacK. Site-specific mutations in pNR14 and pNR19 were constructed either by polymerase chain reaction methods or using the QuikChangeTM system (Stratagene). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing using the Applied Biosystems PrismTM BigDyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PE Applied Biosystems). An overnight culture of K38 containing both pGP1-2 (36.Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar) and the appropriate pT7 recombinant plasmid was grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani medium at 30 °C with the appropriate concentrations of antibiotics (12.Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The strain was subcultured at a 1:80 dilution in fresh Luria-Bertani medium and grown until the A 600 nm reached 0.2. At this point 1 ml of culture was harvested and washed once in M9 medium (35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The washed cells were resuspended in 5 ml of M9 medium supplemented with 0.002% thiamine, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and a methionine- and cysteine-free amino acid mix (0.01%). The cells were grown for a further hour at 30 °C. During this period, and for the remainder of the experiment, the cells were incubated in 5 ml of M9 plus supplements in a 25-ml universal tube. Synthesis of the plasmid-encoded Tat-dependent precursor proteins, which are under the transcriptional control of the T7 φ10 promoter, was induced by a temperature shift from 30 °C to 42 °C for 15 min. This was followed by the addition of 400 μg/ml rifampicin to inhibit theE. coli RNA polymerase. The samples were maintained at 42 °C for a further 10 min and then transferred to 30 °C for 20 min prior to labeling. 0.05 mCi of [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) was added to each 5-ml culture. For the pulse-only experiments the initial 0.5-ml sample was taken immediately. For the pulse-chase experiments the initial 0.5-ml sample was collected after a 5-min labeling period followed by the immediate addition of 750 μg/ml unlabeled methionine. In both types of experiment additional 0.5-ml samples were removed at defined time points during the subsequent incubation. Samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen as they were collected. The samples were subsequently thawed and the cells pelleted by centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in 75 μl of SDS loading buffer, and the samples were analyzed by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE (37.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 280-285Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) on 12.5% acrylamide gels. Quantification of the gel bands was undertaken using a Fuji BAS-1000 PhosphorImager and the software package MacBAS version 2.0. The cells to be fractionated were prepared as for the pulse-chase experiments with the exception that only 2 ml of cell culture was labeled. After the appropriate chase period the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of cell fractionation buffer (30 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mmNa2EDTA), and incubated at 20 °C for 10 min. The cells were centrifuged, the supernatant discarded, and the pellet resuspended in 133 μl of ice-cold 5 mm MgSO4. After 10 min on ice the cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant was retained as the periplasmic fraction. To assess the effect of mutagenesis of the twin arginine consensus region upon protein export it was first necessary to establish an appropriate assay. Since it has not so far proved possible to develop an in vitro transport assay for the bacterial Tat system we investigated methods for studying Tat translocation in whole cells. We chose the precursor of the E. coli protein SufI as the experimental substrate for our in vivo assay. SufI was originally identified on the basis that, when overproduced, it suppressed the cell division defect of an ftsI mutant (38.Kato J.-I. Nishimura Y. Yamada M. Suzuki H. Hirota Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3967-3977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SufI is clearly homologous to the multicopper oxidase superfamily (39.Messerschmidt A. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1993; 40: 121-185Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, SufI is unlikely to bind copper cofactors because it contains only 2 of the 12 consensus copper-binding ligands, and neither of these is conserved in the SufI protein from the closely related organismHaemophilus influenzae. In addition, purified recombinant SufI does not contain detectable copper binding sites. 2N. Stanley, B. C. Berks, and T. Palmer, unpublished observations. It is thus reasonable to expect that the observed export kinetics of SufI will not be complicated by the kinetics of cofactor insertion processes. The use of SufI as the assay substrate has a number of additional practical advantages. SufI is a sufficiently small protein that the mass difference between precursor (51.9 kDa) and mature (49.1 kDa) forms is readily detectable by denaturing electrophoresis, and therefore export can be routinely and conveniently monitored using a SDS-PAGE-based assay. SufI, in contrast to the majority of E. coli Tat substrates, is a water-soluble rather than peripheral membrane protein, which allows export to be confirmed by subcellular fractionation. Use of an indigenous substrate of the E. coli Tat pathway helps ensure that the experimental data obtained in our studies are relevant to the export of physiological substrates. The twin arginine region of the SufI signal peptide (Fig.1, top) exhibits a close match to the Tat consensus sequence differing only in conservatively substituting an isoleucine for the consensus leucine (this is the most frequently observed replacement at this position in Tat signal peptides; see Ref. 7.Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) and substituting a glutamine for the consensus lysine residue. Two additional sequence features typical of bacterial signal peptides (6.Cristóbal S. de Gier J.-W. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2982-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), a proline at the end of the h-region (Pro-22) and a basic residue in the c-region (Lys-24), are also present in the SufI signal sequence. A plasmid, pNR14, was constructed in which expression ofsufI is under the control of the T7 φ10 promoter. Upon provision of T7 RNA polymerase, and in the presence of rifampicin to block transcription from E. coli promoters, this construct allows specific in vivo radiolabeling of the SufI precursor protein. A pulse-chase experiment using the sufI-bearing plasmid pNR14 is shown in Fig. 1 a. After induction of T7 polymerase coded by the helper plasmid pGP1-2, the cells were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine, followed by the addition of excess unlabeled methionine. Over time a labeled protein with the apparent molecular mass of pre-SufI is converted to a smaller mature form. Neither form is present when a plasmid lacking thesufI insert is used (not shown), confirming that these proteins correspond to precursor and processed forms of SufI. Subcellular fractionation experiments showed that the mature form represents protein that has been exported to the periplasm (Fig.1 b, lanes 2 and 3). A strain bearing a deletion in the tatC gene has been shown previously to be completely defective in the correct localization of proteins with Tat signal peptides (13.Bogsch E.G. Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Robinson C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18003-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). When the pulse-chase experiment was repeated in this ΔtatC background only the precursor protein was visible after a 60-min chase (Fig. 1 b,lane 1), indicating that processing of pre-SufI is exclusively Tat-dependent and that no export of this protein occurs via the Sec pathway. Although export of wild-type precursor is essentially complete within minutes (Fig. 1 a), precursors with mutated signal peptides were anticipated to have slowed rates of export. It was therefore important to establish that export continued to occur for extended time periods under our assay conditions. In the experiments shown in Fig.1 c, labeling of newly synthesized pre-SufI was initiated by the addition of [35S]methionine and allowed to continue throughout the experiment. The mature protein continued to accumulate over the full 60-min time period, demonstrating that export occurs throughout the time scale of the experiment. A range of site-specific amino acid substitutions was introduced into the signal peptide coding region ofsufI. The resulting engineered precursors have been given shorthand designations made up of the substituted amino acid type and position followed by the replacement amino acid. Thus precursor SufI-R5K carries a lysine substitution of the arginine at position five in the SufI signal peptide. The effects of the various site-specific mutations on the export kinetics of pre-SufI were assessed by pulse-chase assays. The averaged export data for a minimum of three independent cultures expressing each engineered precursor are plotted in Fig. 2. Fractionation studies were used to verify that the mature protein observed in the pulse-chase experiments was located in the periplasm (data not shown). These experiments confirm that the slow processing exhibited by some of the signal peptide mutants represents a genuine export event and is not a consequence of nonspecific proteolysis of the unexported precursor protein. No processing was observed over a 60-min chase for any of the mutant precursors when the export experiments were repeated in a ΔtatC background (data not shown). Thus, none of the signal peptide mutations investigated in this study caused the precursor protein to default onto the Sec export pathway. This phenotype may not, however, reflect the true potential for interactions between the altered signal peptides and the Sec apparatus but may instead originate from an incompatibility between the Sec pathway and the mature SufI protein. Indeed, there is now clear evidence that some Tat pathway proteins are inherently refractory to transport by the Sec apparatus (20.Rodrigue A. Chanal A. Beck K. Müller M. Wu L.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13223-13228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 24.Bogsch E.G. Brink S. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The invariant arginine residues of pre-SufI were conservatively replaced both individually and in combination by the amino acid lysine. The individual arginine to lysine mutations severely retard export of pre-SufI, whereas export was blocked completely when both arginines were replaced (Fig. 2 a). These results are in marked contrast to the behavior of Sec signal peptides where mutations that conserve the n-region charge have no effect on the transport process (40.Sasaki S. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4358-4363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and argue that both Tat consensus arginine residues play a specific and critical role in mediating the interaction between the signal peptide and the Tat apparatus. That the single lysine for arginine mutations in the SufI signal peptide still permits transport by the Tat pathway was surprising because equivalent mutations had been found to block both the Tat-dependent export ofZymomonas mobilis glucose-fructose oxidoreductase (29.Halbig D. Wiegert T. Blaudeck N. Freudl R. Sprenger G.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and the import of wheat pre-23K protein via the plant thylakoid Tat system (16.Chaddock A.M. Mant A. Karnauchov I. Brink S. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, a further study using a Tat signal peptide:β-lactamase chimera expressed in E. coli suggested that the first consensus arginine residue could be replaced not only by lysine but also by glutamate, valine, or isoleucine without completely blocking export (26.Nivière V. Wong S.-L. Voordouw G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2173-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It should be kept in mind though that there is no evidence that the transport observed in this early study was mediated by the Tat pathway. These variations in the severity of a single lysine for Tat consensus arginine substitutions observed in different studies could be indicative of genuine differences in the behavior of disparate signal peptides. Alternatively, they could be a consequence of the variable sensitivity of the export assays employed by different investigators. In an attempt to distinguish between these two possibilities we produced an additional lysine for arginine mutation in another E. coli Tat substrate, pre-YacK, a multicopper oxidase (39.Messerschmidt A. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1993; 40: 121-185Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) of unknown physiological function. YacK is homologous to SufI (37% amino acid sequence identity), and the two proteins have quite similar Tat signal peptides (Figs. 1 and 3). A pulse-chase export assay analogous to that used for pre-SufI was established for pre-YacK with the processed mature form of YacK shown to be located in the periplasm (Fig. 3 a, lanes 2and 3), and export demonstrated to betatC-dependent (Fig. 3 a, lane 1) and to continue for at least 60 min after labeling was initiated (data not shown).

Reactive oxygen species also cause activation of JNK; however, the signaling cascade that leads to JNK activation remains to be elucidated. Because recent reports showed that expression of Cas, a putative Src substrate, stimulates JNK activation, we hypothesized that the Src kinase family and Cas would be involved in JNK activation by reactive oxygen species. An essential role for both Src and Cas was demonstrated. First, the specific Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP2, inhibited JNK activation by H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and p38 activation. Second, JNK activation in response to H2O2 was completely inhibited in cells derived from transgenic mice deficient in Src but not Fyn. Third, expression of a dominant negative mutant of Cas prevented H2O2-mediated JNK activation but had no effect on extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and p38 activation. Finally, the importance of Src was further supported by the inhibition of both H2O2-mediated Cas tyrosine phosphorylation and Cas·Crk complex formation in Src−/− but not Fyn−/− cells. These results demonstrate an essential role for Src and Cas in H2O2-mediated activation of JNK and suggest a new redox-sensitive pathway for JNK activation mediated by Src. c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) is activated by a number of cellular stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines and environmental stresses.

Recently, it has been shown that ROS stimulate intracellular signal events similar to those activated by growth factors including members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, namely extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 kinase (3.Devary Y.

Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The ERKs are involved in anabolic processes (cell growth, division, and differentiation). In contrast, the JNKs and p38 appear to be involved primarily in the responses of cells to cytotoxic agents and interventions. It has been reported by several investigators that ROS also increase JNK activation (5.Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Three family members (c-Src, Fyn, and Yes) are expressed ubiquitously and appear to have partially overlapping functions on the basis of studies with transgenic mice (9.Pascal S.M. Singer A.U.

Functional domains shared by Src family kinases include an amino-terminal myristoylation sequence for membrane targeting, a unique domain, SH2 and SH3 domains, a kinase domain, and a carboxyl-terminal noncatalytic domain. These regions participate in a complex tonic inhibition of Src family kinases which can be overcome when cells are exposed to mitogens. One of the residues that appears to be critical for regulation of c-Src is Tyr527, which is not present in v-Src. Phosphorylation of Tyr527 by COOH-terminal Src kinase inhibits c-Src activity (10.Klages S. Adam D. Class K. Fargnoli J. Bolen J.B. Penhallow R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2597-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas dephosphorylation of this residue appears to be an activating mechanism. Autophosphorylation of Tyr416 in the catalytic domain may be another activating signal. Src activity is also inhibited via intramolecular interactions of the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domains with both the SH2 and SH3 domains (11.Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). These SH2 and SH3 domains probably also stimulate c-Src activity through interactions with regulators and downstream/kinase substrates.Src-dependent signal events are mediated by assembly of signal transduction complexes that involve the adapter molecule p130 CT-10 regulated kinase (Crk)-associated substrate (Cas). Cas has a single SH3 domain followed by multiple SH2 binding motifs in a well defined substrate domain. Cas localizes to focal adhesions and associates not only with focal adhesion proteins such as focal adhesion kinases, paxillin, and tensin (12.Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine the specific role of Src family kinases, we utilized specific Src family kinase inhibitors and cells derived from animals deficient in Src and Fyn. We show here that H2O2-mediated activation of JNK, but not ERK1/2 or p38, is regulated by Src but not by Fyn. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Src is required for H2O2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas and Cas·Crk complex formation. Thus, the Src-Cas-Crk-JNK signaling pathway described here may represent a new redox-sensitive mechanism.DISCUSSIONThe major findings of this study are that H2O2 stimulates JNK via a pathway that is dependent on Src and p130Cas but not Fyn. Redox-sensitive regulation of Cas/JNK is thus a new function for Src. Data to support an essential role for Src and Cas in H2O2-mediated JNK activation include the following findings. 1) PP2, a specific Src family kinase inhibitor, prevented H2O2-mediated activation of JNK, but not ERK1/2 or p38, in VSMC and fibroblasts. 2) In Src−/− fibroblasts, there was no JNK activation in response to H2O2. In contrast, in Fyn−/− fibroblasts, H2O2-mediated JNK activation was similar to wild type fibroblasts. 3) Cas tyrosine phosphorylation and Cas·Crk complex formation by H2O2 were also inhibited in Src−/− fibroblasts but not in Fyn−/− fibroblasts. 4) A dominant negative mutant of Cas which fails to bind Crk blocked H2O2-mediated activation of JNK but not ERK1/2 and p38. Our results are the first to show that Src, but not Fyn, is involved specifically in oxidative stress-mediated JNK activation, via a Cas/Crk signaling pathway.Based on the present study, as well as previous work from our laboratory (4.Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 8.Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.-D. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

Science. 2000; 287: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we propose a scheme (Fig. 8) for ROS-mediated signal transduction leading to activation of Cas and JNK. A novel aspect of this model is the specific role of Src but not Fyn. Previously we found that Fyn but not Src was required for H2O2-mediated janus kinase 2 activation in fibroblasts (29.Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21003-21010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the present study, we found that Src but not Fyn was required for H2O2-mediated JNK activation in fibroblasts. These results indicate that c-Src and Fyn have separate roles in ROS-mediated signal transduction. Src family kinases share several functional domains including an amino-terminal myristoylation sequence for membrane targeting, a unique domain, SH2 and SH3 domains, a kinase domain, and a carboxyl-terminal noncatalytic domain. Functional properties of the amino-terminal unique region have not been well defined. Current data indicate that this domain may be required for specific interactions between particular Src family kinases and downstream targets. We have also found that Src and Fyn specifically regulate big mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (BMK1) and janus kinase 2, respectively (8.Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.-D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 29.Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

Future studies will be required to define the precise nature of the downstream substrates for c-Src and Fyn.In addition to activation of JNK by Src, the present study demonstrates that H2O2-mediated Cas tyrosine phosphorylation and Cas·Crk complex formation are dependent on Src but not Fyn (Fig.8). Once phosphorylated, Cas acts as a docking protein to recruit Crk and its effectors (14.Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24479-24484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The SH3 domains of Crk may bind several effectors capable of activating JNK, including C3G, DOCK180, and Sos (34.Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1281-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have reported that the Crk-dependent stimulation of JNK requires C3G, a guanine nucleotide exchange protein for the Ras family of small G proteins. Transient expression of C3G in 293T cells induced JNK activation without a significant effect on ERK, whereas mSos activated both JNK and ERK1/2 equally. Coexpression of the dominant negative form of Ras-N17 did not suppress C3G-induced JNK activation but reduced the activity of JNK induced by mSos, suggesting that Ras is not required for JNK activation by C3G. Ras-independent activation of JNK was supported by the finding that C3G-induced JNK activation was not inhibited by the dominant negative forms of Rac or PAK, which are components of the signaling pathway from Ras leading to JNK activation (34.Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Dolfi et al. (22.Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) have also found that transient expression of Crk induces JNK activation, and this activation was dependent on both the SH2 and SH3 domains of Crk. Expression of p130Cas also induced JNK activation, which was blocked by the SH2 mutant of Crk. In contrast to Tanaka and Hanafusa (37.Tanaka S. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1281-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), Dolfi et al.(22.Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) reported that JNK activation by Cas and Crk was effectively blocked by a dominant negative form of Rac, suggesting a linear pathway from the Cas·Crk complex to Rac-JNK activation. Thus, the role of C3G in JNK and cytoskeletal reorganization remains controversial. DOCK180 has been implicated previously in up-regulation of the Cas·Crk-mediated signaling pathways and was shown to activate Rac1 and JNK (22.Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the Cas·Crk signaling complex functions as a “molecular switch” for cell migration because overexpression of the two molecules stimulated cell migration. Significantly, Klemke et al. (19.Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) found that dominant negative forms of Cas and Crk were able to block both integrin-mediated and cytokine-induced migration. An important role for Src in Cas-dependent cell migration is suggested by our findings that Src is the major tyrosine kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Cas by angiotensin II, thrombin, and shear stress. We have found that expression of kinase-negative Src reduced the rate of VSMC spreading on collagen, whereas wild type Src enhanced cell spreading, indicating an essential role for Src in cell adhesion and morphology (39.Ishida T. Ishida M. Suero J. Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cas plays a key role in cytoskeletal reorganization because it is localized to focal adhesions, binds to Src via its SH3 domain, and to other signaling molecules such as Crk, Nck, FAK, and PTP-PEST via SH2 binding motifs. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas by H2O2 was completely dependent on Src, indicating the importance of Src in H2O2-mediated events. Further studies will be required to determine the role of JNK activation in cell migration and other downstream events activated by ROS. Reactive oxygen species (ROS),1 including H2O2, O2−, and OH−, have been identified as important chemical mediators that regulate signal transduction, and the importance of ROS in pathological events is becoming increasingly apparent. Because increased ROS may be a risk factor for cardiovascular events such as unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden death, understanding the biological processes that generate ROS and the intracellular signals elicited by ROS will be useful for gaining insights into the pathogenesis of these diseases (1.Halliwell B.

A novel aspect of this model is the specific role of Src but not Fyn. Previously we found that Fyn but not Src was required for H2O2-mediated janus kinase 2 activation in fibroblasts (29.Abe J.

In contrast, in the present study, we found that Src but not Fyn was required for H2O2-mediated JNK activation in fibroblasts. These results indicate that c-Src and Fyn have separate roles in ROS-mediated signal transduction. Src family kinases share several functional domains including an amino-terminal myristoylation sequence for membrane targeting, a unique domain, SH2 and SH3 domains, a kinase domain, and a carboxyl-terminal noncatalytic domain. Functional properties of the amino-terminal unique region have not been well defined. Current data indicate that this domain may be required for specific interactions between particular Src family kinases and downstream targets. We have also found that Src and Fyn specifically regulate big mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (BMK1) and janus kinase 2, respectively (8.Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.-D. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

Future studies will be required to define the precise nature of the downstream substrates for c-Src and Fyn.In addition to activation of JNK by Src, the present study demonstrates that H2O2-mediated Cas tyrosine phosphorylation and Cas·Crk complex formation are dependent on Src but not Fyn (Fig.8). Once phosphorylated, Cas acts as a docking protein to recruit Crk and its effectors (14.Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell.

Transient expression of C3G in 293T cells induced JNK activation without a significant effect on ERK, whereas mSos activated both JNK and ERK1/2 equally. Coexpression of the dominant negative form of Ras-N17 did not suppress C3G-induced JNK activation but reduced the activity of JNK induced by mSos, suggesting that Ras is not required for JNK activation by C3G. Ras-independent activation of JNK was supported by the finding that C3G-induced JNK activation was not inhibited by the dominant negative forms of Rac or PAK, which are components of the signaling pathway from Ras leading to JNK activation (34.Tanaka S.

Thus, the role of C3G in JNK and cytoskeletal reorganization remains controversial. DOCK180 has been implicated previously in up-regulation of the Cas·Crk-mediated signaling pathways and was shown to activate Rac1 and JNK (22.Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the Cas·Crk signaling complex functions as a “molecular switch” for cell migration because overexpression of the two molecules stimulated cell migration. Significantly, Klemke et al. (19.Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) found that dominant negative forms of Cas and Crk were able to block both integrin-mediated and cytokine-induced migration. An important role for Src in Cas-dependent cell migration is suggested by our findings that Src is the major tyrosine kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Cas by angiotensin II, thrombin, and shear stress. We have found that expression of kinase-negative Src reduced the rate of VSMC spreading on collagen, whereas wild type Src enhanced cell spreading, indicating an essential role for Src in cell adhesion and morphology (39.Ishida T. Ishida M. Suero J. Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cas plays a key role in cytoskeletal reorganization because it is localized to focal adhesions, binds to Src via its SH3 domain, and to other signaling molecules such as Crk, Nck, FAK, and PTP-PEST via SH2 binding motifs. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas by H2O2 was completely dependent on Src, indicating the importance of Src in H2O2-mediated events. Further studies will be required to determine the role of JNK activation in cell migration and other downstream events activated by ROS. The major findings of this study are that H2O2 stimulates JNK via a pathway that is dependent on Src and p130Cas but not Fyn. Redox-sensitive regulation of Cas/JNK is thus a new function for Src. Data to support an essential role for Src and Cas in H2O2-mediated JNK activation include the following findings. 1) PP2, a specific Src family kinase inhibitor, prevented H2O2-mediated activation of JNK, but not ERK1/2 or p38, in VSMC and fibroblasts. 2) In Src−/− fibroblasts, there was no JNK activation in response to H2O2. In contrast, in Fyn−/− fibroblasts, H2O2-mediated JNK activation was similar to wild type fibroblasts. 3) Cas tyrosine phosphorylation and Cas·Crk complex formation by H2O2 were also inhibited in Src−/− fibroblasts but not in Fyn−/− fibroblasts. 4) A dominant negative mutant of Cas which fails to bind Crk blocked H2O2-mediated activation of JNK but not ERK1/2 and p38. Our results are the first to show that Src, but not Fyn, is involved specifically in oxidative stress-mediated JNK activation, via a Cas/Crk signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2090033907,"We report here a characterization of two families of calcium-activated K+ channel β-subunits, β2 and β3, which are encoded by distinct genes that map to 3q26.2–27. A single β2 family member and four alternatively spliced variants of β3 were investigated. These subunits have predicted molecular masses of 27.1–31.6 kDa, share ∼30–44% amino acid identity with β1, and exhibit distinct but overlapping expression patterns. Coexpression of the β2 or β3a–c subunits with a BK α-subunit altered the functional properties of the current expressed by the α-subunit alone. The β2 subunit rapidly and completely inactivated the current and shifted the voltage dependence for activation to more polarized membrane potentials. In contrast, coexpression of the β3a–c subunits resulted in only partial inactivation of the current, and the β3b subunit conferred an apparent inward rectification. Furthermore, unlike the β1 and β2 subunits, none of the β3 subunits increased channel sensitivity to calcium or voltage. The tissue-specific expression of these β-subunits may allow for the assembly of a large number of distinct BK channels in vivo, contributing to the functional diversity of native BK currents.

Calcium-activated K+ channels (KCa)1 modulate cellular electrical excitability. These channels are gated by both cytoplasmic calcium and membrane potential and, therefore, provide feedback mechanisms to modulate Ca2+ influx. Activation of KCa channels hyperpolarizes cells, and the way in which this hyperpolarization regulates Ca2+ entry is dependent upon the nature of the influx pathway. For example, entry through voltage-gated calcium channels (e.g. in myocytes) may be decreased, due to voltage-dependent deactivation of the calcium channels (1Heppner T.J. Bonev A.D. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C110-C117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Marrion N.V. Tavalin S.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 3Vergara C. Latorre R. Marrion N.V. Adelman J.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). However, influx through voltage-independent channels (e.g. in endothelial cells) may be enhanced due to an increase in the driving force for Ca2+ (4Sharma N.R. Davis M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H156-H164PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sullivan R. Koliwad S.K. Kunze D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1342-C1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the regulatory roles of KCachannels are context-dependent and may vary with cell type. KCa currents have been recorded from a variety of tissues and have traditionally been classified into broad categories based on single channel conductance (e.g. large, intermediate, or small conductance). However, in addition to these differences in unitary current amplitude, distinct KCa currents may also vary in terms of their calcium- and voltage dependence, kinetics, or pharmacologic properties (3Vergara C.

Native KCa channels, therefore, comprise a large and functionally diverse family. In recent years, the structural basis of this diversity has been investigated. Significant progress in this regard has been made with large conductance (BK) KCa channels in particular, some of which have been both biochemically purified and cloned (8Ferrer J. Wasson J.

BK channels have been purified from tracheal and aortic smooth muscles and demonstrated to be composed of two distinct types of subunits in those tissues: a large pore-forming α-subunit and a smaller modulatory β-subunit (13Knaus H.G.

Two distinct genes encoding BK β-subunits have been identified: KCNMB1, which encodes the β1 subunit originally isolated from airway smooth muscle (11Knaus H.G. Folander K. Garcia-Calvo M.

Although functional BK channels can be expressed from α-subunits alone, coassembly with β-subunits can alter the biophysical and pharmacologic properties of the channel (15Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L.

However, the properties of some native BK currents are not well reproduced by combinations of currently known α- and β-subunits, suggesting the possibility that novel subunits of these channels may still exist. We identified two families of BK β-subunits. The first, which, to date, contains only a single member (β2), is identical to that recently identified in a lung carcinoid EST library (15Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 16Xia X.M. Ding J.P. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second, the β3 family, comprises four distinct subunits (β3a–d) that arise by alternative splicing of a single gene. Coexpression of the β2 or β3a, -b, or- c subunits with a BK α-subunit alters the functional properties of the current from that of the α-subunit expressed alone. However, unlike the β2 subunit, which both inactivates the channel and increases its calcium and voltage sensitivity, the β3 subunits do not increase the calcium or voltage sensitivity of the current. The differential expression of these novel β-subunits may underlie part of the large functional diversity observed in native BK currents. Sequence encoding the β1 subunit (U61537) was used to search the GenBank™ data base for homologues using the BLASTN and TBLASTN algorithms of the GCG software package (Wisconsin Genetics Group). This search identified an EST (AA904191) that, when completely sequenced, was demonstrated to encode a full-length KCaβ-subunit, β2. A fragment of this cDNA containing the coding region and 105 bp of the 3′-UTR was amplified by PCR using gene-specific oligonucleotide primers, cloned into pMVpl+ (a modified version of pSP64T (20Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) containing an expanded polylinker), and confirmed by complete sequencing of both strands. The open reading frame and deduced amino acid sequence of β2 were then used to query the GenBank™ data base again. Iterative searches identified several human ESTs (AA195381, AA236930, AA236968,AA279911, AA761761, and AA934876) encoding partial sequences of novel putative BK β-subunits (β3). Commercially available cDNAs encoding these ESTs (AA195381, AA279911, and AA761761) were purchased and sequenced, which demonstrated that none encoded a full-length protein. To isolate the entire coding regions, 5′-RACE (21Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar) was performed using Marathon-Ready spleen cDNA (CLONTECH) and nested gene-specific antisense primers, both of which were derived from the 3′-UTR of the putative β3. Specifically amplified products were identified in two ways: 1) by cloning and sequencing the major PCR products identified by agarose gel electrophoresis and 2) by cloning the products of the entire unfractionated amplification reaction and probing resultant colonies with a β3-specific probe (nucleotides 84–449 of AA195381). The amplification reactions were performed several times on two different lots of spleen cDNA. RACE products obtained in this manner were sequenced on both strands and shown to encode four distinct members of a novel family of β-subunits, β3a–d. For functional expression, the coding regions of the β3 cDNAs were amplified by PCR using sense primers that removed the 5′-UTR and improved the translation initiation sequence. The amplified fragments were cloned into pMVpl+ and confirmed by sequencing both strands. Sequences encoding β3a–d were used to search the high through put genomic sequence data base, resulting in the identification of several β3 gene fragments (AA195511, AA279608, AC007823, AQ093921, AQ096353,AQ590923, and AQ673110). Sequence comparisons showed thatAC007823 contains the alternatively spliced exons and the beginning of the conserved domain of the β3 cDNAs. The other genomic sequences each contain different amounts of the conserved core. To obtain the complete coding sequence, an arrayed human genomic DNA library was screened by PCR (Genome Systems) for the β3 gene using two sets of primers, one pair annealing in the β3b 5′-UTR and the other in the conserved core domain. Four BACs, each encoding part of the β3 gene, were identified and analyzed by PCR for exons encoding the splice variant-specific and conserved domains. These amplifications also enabled approximation of intron/exon boundaries and sizes within the gene. Appropriate regions of each clone were then sequenced to confirm and refine the results. The chromosomal locations of the β2, β3, and GCF2 genes were mapped by radiation hybrid analysis, which was carried out using DNAs isolated from the Stanford G3 (22Stewart E.A. McKusick K.B. Aggarwal A. Bajorek E. Brady S. Chu A. Fang N. Hadley D. Harris M. Hussain S. Lee R. Maratukulam A. O'Connor K. Perkins S. Piercy M. Qin F. Reif T. Sanders C. She X. Sun W.L. Tabar P. Voyticky S. Cowles S. Fan J.B. Cox D.R. et al.Genome Res. 1997; 7: 422-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and GeneBridge4 (23Walter M.A. Spillett D.J. Thomas P. Weissenbach J. Goodfellow P.N. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) radiation hybrid panels (Research Genetics). The presence or absence of the human gene in each of the DNA samples was determined by amplification of a fragment of that gene by PCR. Control experiments demonstrated no amplification of homologous hamster genes by any of the primer pairs used. To distinguish between amplification of the β3b and GCF2 genes, a BsaBI restriction fragment length polymorphism was utilized. This enzyme distinguishes β3b from GCF2 by virtue of a BsaBI site unique to the β3b gene. Thus, only fragments cleaved by BsaBI were scored as positive for the presence of the β3b exon. Similarly, a complementaryPstI restriction fragment length polymorphism, unique to the GCF2 gene, was used to score fragments as GCF2-positive. Scoring data were transferred electronically to the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research or the Stanford Human Genome Center for analysis with the LOD score cutoff set to 15. The β3 gene was also mapped by fluorescence in situhybridization (FISH) in experiments performed by Genome Systems. Briefly, BAC DNA was isolated from clones B716 (β3c and conserved core), B766 (β3a–c unique exons), and B767 (β3b-core) and labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP by nick translation. Labeled probe was combined with a biotin-conjugated probe specific for centromeric sequences of chromosome 3 and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2% SSC. Probe detection was accomplished by incubating the slides with fluoresceinated antidigoxigenin antibodies and Texas Red avidin, followed by counterstaining with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). First strand cDNAs, prepared from human heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, thymus, prostate, testes, ovary, small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood leukocyte mRNAs, were purchased from CLONTECH and used as templates for PCR amplification reactions using subunit- and splice variant-specific primer pairs. To enable differentiation of fragments amplified from cDNA and contaminating genomic DNA (or incompletely spliced RNA), primer pairs were designed to span at least one intron. To improve specificity, β3 sense primers were designed to anneal in the splice variant-specific domains, which prevented amplification of cDNAs derived from chromosome 22 transcripts. Additionally, antisense primers were designed to anneal within the core domain, which prevented amplification of GCF2 fragments. PCR reactions were assembled according to the Advantage cDNA Polymerase Mix protocol (CLONTECH) and cycled 23 times for 30 s at 94 °C and 4 min at 68 °C. Positive controls for cDNA integrity were performed with primers derived from β-actin (the actin primers did not span an intron and, therefore, amplify fragments from both cDNA and genomic DNA). Products were identified by Southern analysis of blots that were probed with randomly primed,32P-labeled cDNAs specific for β2 (nucleotides 268–1080), β3a (nucleotides 70–384), β3b (nucleotides 463–797), or the core region common to all the β3 splice variants (nucleotides 1158–1450 of β3c). Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C in 0.25 m NaPO4, 0.5 mNaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Blots were washed twice in 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min and twice in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min each and then exposed to x-ray film. Positives were scored as tissues exhibiting a specifically amplified cDNA fragment of the expected size that also hybridized to the cognate probe. Expression analysis was repeated once using a different lot of template cDNAs with consistent results. In situ hybridization experiments were performed using an oligonucleotide probe derived from the sequence unique to β3c. The antisense probe corresponded to nucleotides 907–857, and the control sense probe to nucleotides 825–875 of the β3c sequence. Probes were labeled at their 3′ ends using the DIG oligonucleotide tailing kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with biotin-16-dUTP (Roche) substituted for digoxigenin-dUTP. Formalin fixed human pancreas specimens (National Disease Research Interchange) were processed to paraffin, sectioned at 8 μm, and mounted on Superfrost plus slides (Fisher). In situ hybridization was carried out as described previously using 2 pmol of labeled probe/ml of hybridization buffer (24Lynch K.R. O'Neill G.P. Liu Q. Im D.S. Sawyer N. Metters K.M. Coulombe N. Abramovitz M. Figueroa D.J. Zeng Z. Connolly B.M. Bai C. Austin C.P. Chateauneuf A. Stocco R. Greig G.M. Kargman S. Hooks S.B. Hosfield E. Williams D.L.J. Ford H.A. Caskey C.T. Evans J.F. Nature. 1999; 399: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The hybridization signal was amplified using the TSA Direct Red FISH tyramide reagent (NEN Life Science Products) according to manufacturer's directions. Immunohistochemistry was performed sequentially following in situ hybridization. Sections demonstrating optimal β3c mRNA signal were incubated with either guinea pig anti-human insulin sera (Dako) or rabbit anti-human glucagon sera (Dako) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch; 15 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) or donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch; 15 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline), respectively. Sections were counterstained with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole, and images were obtained and processed using a Nikon E1000 microscope, Micromax CCD camera (Princeton Instruments), and Metamorph imaging program (Universal Imaging). The cDNA encoding the BK α-subunit was a kind gift from Ligia Toro (identical in sequence to U11058 with one exception: this clone contains the conservative R1112K mutation) (25Wallner M. Meera P. Ottolia M. Kaczorowski G.J. Latorre R. Garcia M.L. Stefani E. Toro L. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 185-199PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding channel subunit cDNAs were linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes and cRNA synthesized by standard procedures (26Goldin A.L. Sumikawa K. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 279-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Swanson R. Folander K. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). cRNAs were injected into Xenopusoocytes using 1.5 ng of α-subunit RNA/oocyte ± β-subunit RNA at equimolar concentration, 5-fold, or 10-fold molar excess. The molar ratio of the β/α RNAs in coinjection experiments was varied from 1 to 10 in attempts to maximize stoichiometric assembly of the two subunits. Preliminary comparisons of the magnitudes of functional effects induced by β-subunits demonstrated saturation of effects at <5-fold molar excess of β RNA. Therefore, all subsequent studies were done with β-subunit RNA in 10-fold molar excess over α. Oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in ND-96 (28Goldin A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 266-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and macroscopic KCa currents were recorded from inside-out patches 3–14 days following injection. Recordings were performed in symmetrical potassium; the standard pipette and bath solutions contained 116 mm potassium gluconate, 4 mm potassium chloride, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. CaCl2 was added to the bath solution to yield a final concentration of free ionized calcium of 30 μm, taking the stability constant for calcium gluconate (15.9 m−1) into account (29Adelman J.P. Shen K.Z. Kavanaugh M.P. Warren R.A. Wu Y.N. Lagrutta A. Bond C.T. North R.A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 209-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Currents were recorded using an EPC-7 amplifier (HEKA) and pClamp6.0 software (Axon Instruments). Most current records were filtered at 2 kHz using an 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices) and sampled at 5 kHz, but some records, included in group data, were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 3 kHz. Currents were elicited in the presence of 30 μm bath Ca2+ using a voltage command consisting of a holding potential of −80 mV, followed by a 200-ms prepulse to −160 mV, and finally 500-ms step depolarizations from −80 to +80 mV in 10-mV increments. Tail currents were recorded for 120 ms after returning to the −80 mV holding potential. The hyperpolarizing prepulse was needed to remove steady state inactivation at the holding potential when an inactivating β-subunit was coexpressed. Peak currents were measured, transformed to macroscopic conductances, and plotted as a function of test potential to assess changes in the voltage dependence of activation at 30 μm Ca2+. Where appropriate, Boltzmann equations were fit to these data to estimate midpoints of activation. Maximal inactivation parameters, fractional non-inactivating current, and inactivation rates were measured from current traces acquired in 30 μm Ca2+ at +80 mV. These values were used to calculate saturation of β-subunit effects after coinjection of β- and α-subunit cRNAs at increasing ratios. Inactivation rates were determined from single exponential fits to the data. Fractional non-inactivating current was calculated as steady-state current/peak current, and fractional inactivating current was estimated as peak current minus steady-state current divided by peak current. Values are presented as mean ± S.E. Rabbit anti-peptide antisera was raised (Genosys) against the amino-terminal 15 amino acids of β3b, and initially characterized by immunoprecitpitation of in vitro translated β-subunits. Proteins were translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), in the presence of translation grade [35S]Met (NEN Life Science Products) and canine microsomal membranes (Promega), according to the manufacturers' recommended protocol. Immunoprecipitations were then carried out as described previously (30Deal K.K. Lovinger D.M. Tamkun M.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1666-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 1% Triton X-100 to solubilize the proteins and a 1/100 dilution of either preserum or antiserum. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by fluorography. To investigate the synthesis of β-subunits in Xenopusoocytes, cells were injected with cRNAs encoding β3b or β3d and incubated overnight at room temperature in 1 ml ND-96 supplemented with 0.5 mCi of ICN Tran35S-label (1175 Ci/mmol) to metabolically label newly synthesized proteins. Solubilization and immunoprecipitation (from batches of 24–30 oocytes) was carried out as described previously (31Khorana H.G. Knox B.E. Nasi E. Swanson R. Thompson D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7917-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), using 1% Triton X-100 as the detergent and a 1/100 dilution of preserum or antiserum. Immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by fluorography. A combination of data base searching and classical molecular biological techniques resulted in the identification of two families of β-subunits, β2 and β3. The initial data base searches were carried out using the amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the BK β-subunit purified from airway and vascular smooth muscle (β1) (11Knaus H.G. Folander K. Garcia-Calvo M. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Smith M. Swanson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17274-17278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as the query and identified an EST encoding a full-length homologue (β2). Subsequent searches with the β2 sequence then identified several ESTs encoding parts of another putative β-subunit (β3). None of these latter cDNAs encoded a full-length protein, so 5′-RACE was performed to complete the coding sequences. Because many of these ESTs were derived from a tonsil preparation enriched for B cells, cDNA from spleen (an available tissue that is also rich in B cells) was used as the template. A novel family of 4 β-subunits (β3a–d) was cloned from the products of that reaction. The PCR reactions were repeated several times using two different spleen cDNA preparations with consistent results. Although differing in primary sequence, the overall structure of the β2 and β3 subunits is similar to that of β1, containing two hydrophobic, putative transmembrane domains (Fig.1). The deduced amino acid sequence of the β2 subunit is 235 residues in length, predicting a 27.1-kDa protein that shares 44% pairwise amino acid identity with β1. The β3 family consists of four related subunits (Fig. 1), ranging in length from 257 to 279 amino acids (29.1–31.6 kDa) that are approximately 32% and 41% identical to β1 and β2, respectively. The β3a–d subunits vary only in their cytoplasmic, amino-terminal sequence and share 256 carboxyl-terminal amino acids. A single nucleotide polymorphism was identified within this conserved domain of the β3 family. The nucleotide (at position 1350 of the β3c cDNA sequence) was found to be either G or A (11 G and 9 A in 20 independent cDNAs), resulting in either a Ser or an Asn in the encoded protein (position 161 in the β3c amino acid sequence), and this single nucleotide polymorphism was found in cDNAs encoding each of the β3 splice variants. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of BK β-subunits (Fig.1) demonstrates that sequence conservation between families is strongest within the two putative transmembrane domains and, to a lesser extent, in the connecting extracellular loop. The unique amino-terminal sequences of the β2 and β3 variants are longer than that of β1 and contain consensus sequences for phosphorylation by several different protein kinases, including some that are found in all of the subunits (e.g. protein kinase A sites) and some that are restricted to particular family members (e.g. tyrosine kinase sites in β3). Each of the β-subunits contains potentialN-linked glycosylation sites within the extracellular loop, but the number is subunit-dependent, ranging from 1 to 3. The carboxyl-terminal domain of the β3 subunit is also longer than that found in either β1 or β2, and contains a leucine zipper motif that starts in the second transmembrane domain. Data base searches with the nucleotide sequences encoding β2 and β3a–d resulted in the identification of two additional DNAs that are homologous to different regions of the β3 gene. The first, homologous to the β3b domain, is a cDNA (U69609 and AJ223075) encoding a transcription factor, GCF2 (32Reed A.L. Yamazaki H. Kaufman J.D. Rubinstein Y. Murphy B. Johnson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21594-21602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 33Wilson S.A. Brown E.C. Kingsman A.J. Kingsman S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3460-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although transcribed from an independent gene (see mapping data below), this cDNA is ∼95% identical to exon 1b and parts of the 2 flanking introns of the β3 gene (Fig.2 A). However, since exon 1b encodes only the 5′-UTR and the initiating methionine of the β3b subunit, there is no homology between GCF2 and any of the BK β-subunits at the amino acid level. The second sequence, a fragment of chromosome 22q11.2 (AP000365 and AP000547), is homologous to the conserved core region of the β3 variants. Sequence analysis revealed >95% nucleotide identity between this region of chromosome 22 and exons 3, 4, and the intervening intron of the β3 gene (Fig. 2). However, there is no further homology to any of the other introns or exons of the β3 gene in the additional >100 kilobase pairs of chromosome 22 sequence available in AP000365 or AP000547. Analysis of the structure of the gene encoding β3a–d demonstrated that this family of subunits arises from alternative splicing of a single gene. A search of the high throughput genomic sequence data base revealed a single entry (AC007823) that contains the unique (5′) sequences of the β3a, β3b, β3c, and β3d cDNAs. All of these sequences, as well as the first 191 bp of the conserved core domain, are present on a 37-kilobase pair fragment of human genomic DNA in the following order: β3a-β3b-β3c/d-core(1–191) (Fig. 2). The sequences unique to the β3a and β3b subunits are present on distinct exons (1a and 1b), whereas the unique β3c and β3d sequences arise by"
https://openalex.org/W2048155476,"UVB radiation-induced formation of dimeric photoproducts at bipyrimidine sites within DNA has been unambiguously associated with the lethal and mutagenic properties of sunlight. The main lesions include the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and the pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone adducts. The latter compounds have been shown in model systems to be converted into their Dewar valence isomers upon exposure to UVB light. A new direct assay, based on the use of liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, is now available to simultaneously detect each of the thymine photoproducts. It was applied to the determination of the yields of formation of the thymine lesions within both isolated and cellular DNA exposed to either UVC or UVB radiation. The cis-syn cyclobutane thymine dimer was found to be the major photoproduct within cellular DNA, whereas the related (6-4) adduct was produced in an approximately 8-fold lower yield. Interestingly, the corresponding Dewar valence isomer could not be detected upon exposure of human cells to biologically relevant doses of UVB radiation."

We demonstrated previously that the cell cycle-related cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6/retinoblastoma protein pathway is required for AB-mediated death. However, the downstream target(s) of this pathway are unknown. We show here that neurons lacking E2F1, a transcription factor regulated by the retinoblastoma protein, are significantly protected from death evoked by AB. Moreover, p53 deficiency does not protect neurons from death, indicating that E2F1-mediated death occurs independently of p53. Neurons protected by E2F1 deficiency have reduced Bax-dependent caspase 3-like activity. However, protection afforded by E2F1, Bax, or caspase 3 deficiency is transient. In the case of E2F1, but not with Bax or caspase 3 deficiency, delayed death is accompanied by DEVD-AFC cleavage activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate the required role of E2F1, Bax, and caspase 3 in AB evoked death, but also suggest the participation of elements independent of these apoptosis regulators.

Alzheimer's disease B-amyloid cyclin-dependent kinase retinoblastoma base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction terminal nucleotidyl transferase Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairment (1.Cotman C.W. Pike C.J. Terry R.D. Katzman R. Bick K. Alzheimer's Disease. Raven Press, New York1994: 305-315Google Scholar). Although the etiology of AD is not fully understood, an increasing body of evidence suggests the importance of B-amyloid in the initiation/progression of the disease. B-amyloid (AB), a 39–43-amino acid peptide, assembles into insoluble aggregates forming plaques characteristic of AD (2.Jarret J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar, 3.Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol.

Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) demonstrated neuronal loss by an apoptotic pathway. However, the mechanism by which AB causes neuronal apoptosis is not well understood. Recent evidence has suggested that cell cycle molecules that normally control cell proliferation play an important required role in some forms of neuronal death. Of particular relevance to AD, numerous reports demonstrate abnormal up-regulation of a variety of cell cycle proteins/activity in brains from AD patients. These include cyclin B, D, and E, cdc2, and Cdk4 (11.Busser J. Gelmacher D.S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2801-2807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Vincent I. Jicha G. Rosado M. Dickson D.W.

In addition, phosphoepitopes, including phosphorylated tau, common to both mitotic cells and degenerating AD neurons, have been described (12.Vincent I. Jicha G. Rosado M. Dickson D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3588-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In support of the potential importance of cell cycle in AD, we have shown that flavopiridol, a pharmacological inhibitor of Cdks, as well as expression of dominant negative Cdk4/6 but not 2 or 3, protects cultured cortical neurons from death evoked by AB (14.Giovanni A. Wirtz-Brugger F. Keramaris E. Slack R. Park D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19011-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This evidence supports the idea that Cdk4/6 activation plays an obligatory role in death of neurons evoked by AB. These previous observations raise the question of the relevant target of Cdk4/6 in neurons and whether the activity of such targets is required for neuronal death. The only known substrates for Cdk4/6 are members of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) family (15.Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. nevins J.R.

Although the function of Rb family members is likely complex, its role in cell cycle regulation by interaction with E2F family members is best characterized (18.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). In this regard, phosphorylation of Rb members by Cdks results in release and activation of the transcription factor E2F, which then activates genes required for S phase transition. Transcriptional activation by E2F requires association with its obligate binding partner DP1/2 (19.Girling R. Partridge J.F. Bandara L.R. Burden N. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. La Thangue N.B.

Interestingly, the role of Rb and E2F in control of apoptosis has also been suggested. In numerous cases, expression of Rb is protective against death (22.Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J.

Finally, we reported previously that Rb becomes phosphorylated during AB-evoked death and that expression of dominant negative DP1 is neuroprotective (14.Giovanni A. Wirtz-Brugger F. Keramaris E. Slack R. Park D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19011-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that E2F family members may play a required role in death of neurons evoked by AB. Accordingly, we examined whether E2F1 deficiency is protective against AB-evoked death. In addition, we explored the potential role of three common apoptotic elements, the tumor suppresser p53, the BCL2 family member Bax, and the cysteine protease caspase 3, and determined how E2F1 may be ordered in relation to these apoptotic elements. We show here that E2F1 transiently protects cortical neurons from AB-evoked death in a p53-independent manner. In addition, we show that E2F1 acts upstream of Bax-dependent caspase 3 activation required for acute, but not delayed, neuronal death.

BAF and DEVD-AFC were purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). p53, Bax, and caspase 3-deficient (C57BL/6 background) neurons were obtained from embryos derived from heterozygous pairings. E2F1 (B6/129 background)-deficient neurons were obtained from embryos of E2F1 (−/+) × E2F1 (−/−) breedings. For each experiment, neurons obtained from heterozygote or wild type littermate embryos were used as controls. Genotyping of each individual embryo was performed by PCR as follows. p53 was genotyped using GTATCTGGAAGACAGGCAGAC (O-p53–1) and TGTACTTGTAGTGGATGGTGG (O-p53–2) primers to detect the wild type allele (450 bp) and TATACTCAGAGCCGGCCT (O-p53-X7) and TTCCTCGTGCTTTACGGTATC (O-neo-2) primers to detect the targeted allele (533 bp). PCR conditions are as follows: 94 °C, 5 min (1 cycle); 94 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min (30 cycles); 72 °C, 10 min. E2F1 was genotyped using GGATATGATTCTTGGACTTCTTGG (E2F1–5′), CTAAATCTGACCACCAAACGC (E2F1–3′), and CAAGTGCCAGCGGGGCTGCTAAAG (PGKB) primers. The primers were used in one PCR to amplify an untargeted 170-bp fragment and a targeted 230-bp fragment. PCR conditions are as follows: 94 °C, 1 min (1 cycle); 94 °C, 5 s; 92 °C, 4 s; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min (30 cycles); 72 °C, 5 min.

F108 and WCPR21 were used to amplify a 1,733-bp fragment from the wild type caspase 3 allele. F108 and LZ1 were used to amplify a 1,605-bp fragment from the targeted caspase 3 allele.

Mouse cortical neurons were cultured from embryonic day 16 mice as described previously (30.Park D.S. Morris E.J. Padmanabhan J. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). For the knockout studies, each individual embryo was dissected and plated individually. The neurons were plated into 24-well dishes (approximately 200,000 cells/well) coated with poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml) in serum-free medium (N2:Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) supplemented with 6 mg/ml d-glucose, 100 μg/ml transferrin, 25 μg/ml insulin, 20 nm progesterone, 60 μmputrescine, 30 nm selenium). Under these conditions, cultures typically contain more than 99% neurons as assessed by staining with antibody directed against phosphorylated neurofilament (RT97, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). 2–3 days after initial plating, the medium was exchanged with serum-free medium supplemented with preaggregated AB (50 μg/ml), or camptothecin (10 μm) and flavopiridol (1 μm) where appropriate. AB was preaggregated by incubation in serum-free medium at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml at 37 °C overnight. At appropriate times of culture under the conditions described, cells were lysed, and the numbers of viable cells were evaluated as described previously (30.Park D.S. Morris E.J. Padmanabhan J. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 200 μl of cell lysis buffer (0.1 × phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm MgCl2, and cetyldimethylethylammonium bromide (0.5 g/100 ml)), which disrupts cells but leaves the nuclei intact. Numbers of healthy nuclei were evaluated by phase microscopy. Nuclei that displayed characteristics of blebbing, disruption of nuclear membrane, phase bright apoptotic bodies, and chromatin margination were excluded. All experimental points are expressed as a percentage of cells present at day of treatment and are reported as mean ± S.E. (n = 3). Cortical neurons were dissociated and cultured as described above. Neurons were harvested, and 10 μg of protein was loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were probed with anti-Bax (Santa Cruz), anti-p53 (Pharmingen), or anti-actin (Sigma) antibodies as indicated. TUNEL analyses were performed using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals kit. Briefly, cortical neurons were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde for 15 min. The cells were permeabilized in 1:1 methanol:acetone for 10 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with Hoechst 33258 (0.5 ng/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. TUNEL labeling was performed per the manufacturer's instructions. Cortical neurons were harvested at the indicated times for caspase activity. Briefly, cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and collected in caspase lysis buffer as described previously (31.Stefanis L. Park D.S. Yan C.Y.I. Farinelli S.E. Troy C.M. Shelanski M.L. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30663-30671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated on ice for 20 min and sonicated briefly for 3 s. The extract was then centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm on an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant was then collected and assayed for protein by Bradford (Bio-Rad), and 5 μg of protein was incubated with DEVD-AFC. The increase in fluorescence was measured using a fluorometer (400 nm excitation, 505 nm emission) as described previously (31.Stefanis L. Park D.S. Yan C.Y.I. Farinelli S.E. Troy C.M. Shelanski M.L.

Total RNA was extracted from rat brains using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNAs were reverse transcribed from 4 μg of total RNA. The same amounts of cDNAs were subsequently used for PCR amplification for a total of 25 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min of each cycle. These optimal amplification conditions and cycle numbers were determined experimentally to ensure specific and linear signal generation, and expression of B-actin mRNA was used as a standard to quantify the relative amount of expression of E2F1 as described previously (32.Hou S.T. Tu Y. Buchan A.M. Huang Z. Preston E. Rasquinha I. Robertson G.S. MacManus J.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mouse specific E2F1 PCR primers (GACTGTGACTTTGGG ACC and TGTTCACCTTCATTCCC) and B-actin primers (AACACCCCAGCCATGTAC GTAG and GTGTTGGCATAGAGGTCTTTACGG) were used to generate an E2F1 PCR product of 434 bp and B-actin fragment of 509 bp. The PCR products were fractionated on a 2% agarose gel, photographed, and quantitated by scanning laser densitometry. The authenticity of the PCR products was confirmed by cloning into a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequencing using an automated Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. Our previous results implicated the Cdk4/6/Rb pathway as an obligate component for death of cortical neurons evoked by AB (14.Giovanni A. Wirtz-Brugger F. Keramaris E. Slack R. Park D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19011-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Our finding that dominant negative DP1 also protected neurons from death suggested that E2F members may play a required role in signaling death under these circumstances. Accordingly, we examined whether E2F1, the E2F member most associated with pro-apoptotic activity, plays a role in death of cortical neurons exposed to AB. As shown in Fig.1 A, treatment with preaggregated AB results in approximately 60% death of embryonic cortical neurons cultured from mice heterozygous deficient for E2F1 (−/+) at 24 h and 80% death of neurons at 48 h. In contrast, significant protection is observed in AB-treated neurons cultured from E2F1 knockout (−/−) littermates (approximately 75% survival after a 24-h AB treatment). This protection is transient and reduced, but significant protection is still observed at 48 h (40% versus 20% in the controls). As shown in Fig.2, more healthy neurons with intact processes are present in cultures of E2F1 (−/−) neurons exposed to AB than in identically treated control cultures that mostly contain apoptotic bodies and degenerating neuritic processes.Figure 2Phase-contrast micrographs of E2F1 (−/+) (panels A and B) or E2F1 (−/−) (panels C and D) cortical neurons untreated (panels A and C) or treated with AB (panels B and D) for 24 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Death of cortical neurons evoked by AB treatment is accompanied by an increase in caspase 3-like activity as reflected by DEVD-AFC cleavage activity, which peaks 12–24 h after AB treatment (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig. 1 B, DEVD-AFC cleavage activity in AB-treated E2F1(−/−) neurons is significantly lower than in E2F1 (−/+) neurons 12 and 24 h after AB treatment. As with survival, however, the differences in DEVD-AFC cleavage activity in E2F1 (−/−) neurons and E2F1(−/+) controls diminish 48 h after AB treatment. The decrease in DEVD-AFC cleavage activity observed in AB-treated E2F1 (−/−) neurons places E2F1 involvement biochemically upstream of caspase 3-like activity. It is important to emphasize, however, that although a reduction in DEVD-AFC cleavage activity is observed in the E2F1 knockouts, it is not eliminated; only a 50–55% reduction in DEVD-AFC cleavage activity is observed at 12 and 24 h. Strikingly, inhibition of death by the Cdk inhibitor flavopiridol results in neuroprotection (14.Giovanni A. Wirtz-Brugger F. Keramaris E. Slack R. Park D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19011-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) accompanied by nearly complete reduction in DEVD-AFC cleavage activity 18 h after AB treatment (data not shown). These data suggest that Cdk activation after AB treatment activates both E2F1-dependent and -independent pathways of caspase activation. Finally, an increase in E2F1 transcript levels, as measured by reverse transcription-PCR, was observed 3 h after AB treatment (Fig. 3). Because E2F1 is known to regulate its own transcription (16.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar), this evidence provides further support for the role of E2F1 in death. Taken together, these observations indicate that E2F1 plays an important role in neuronal death and caspase-3-like activation. However, it shows that signals downstream of Cdk activity other than E2F1 also participate in death evoked by AB. Previous studies demonstrated that E2F-mediated apoptosis can be p53-dependent or -independent (25.Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Adams P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 91: 10918-10922Crossref Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 33.Holmberg C. Helin K. Sehested M. Karlstrom O. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 34.Phillips A.C. Bates S. Ryan K.M. Helin K. Vousden K.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined whether p53 deficiency would lead to protection from AB-evoked death. As shown in Fig. 4 A, cortices cultured from p53 (−/−) embryos are not significantly protected from AB treatment compared with littermate controls. Similarly, no difference in cleavage activity is observed in p53 (−/−) neurons treated with AB (Fig. 4 B). As a control, p53- deficient cultures treated with the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin showed dramatic protection from death and no DEVD-AFC activity by the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin as reported previously (Fig. 4 A). Finally, p53 protein was undetectable in AB-treated cortical neurons (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the actions of E2F1 in AB-evoked neuronal death occur in a p53-independent manner. Our present results indicated that E2F1 acts upstream of DEVD-AFC cleavage reflective of caspase 3-like activity. This observation led to the question of whether caspase 3-like activity was required for AB-induced neuron death. As shown in Fig.5 A, caspase 3 (−/−) neurons are resistant to AB-evoked death (80% survival in caspase 3 (−/−) neurons versus 35% in the controls at 24 h). Neurons from caspase 3 (−/−) or caspase 3 (−/+) neurons show low background levels of TUNEL labeling and healthy nuclei as observed by Hoechst staining. In contrast, numerous caspase 3 (−/+) neurons but not caspase (−/−) neurons treated with AB for 24 h show bright TUNEL labeling and condensed shrunken nuclei as observed by Hoechst (Fig.6). AB-treated neurons from caspase 3 (−/−) mice also lack DEVD-AFC cleavage activity compared with littermate controls (Fig. 5 B). This indicates that the DEVD-AFC cleavage activity observed upon AB treatment is caused by caspase 3 or caspases downstream of caspase 3. As with E2F1 deficiency, the protection observed in caspase 3 (−/−) neurons is transient, and no significant protection is observed at 48 h after AB treatment. Interestingly, prolonged survival is not observed in AB-treated neurons cotreated with the general caspase inhibitor BAF (data not shown). These results suggest that caspase 3 is functionally important for AB-induced neuronal death. In addition, the delayed death that occurs in caspase 3-deficient neurons occurs in a manner independent of caspases.Figure 6AB-treated caspase 3-deficient neurons display impaired DNA fragmentation and condensed nuclei compared with AB-treated control cultures. Untreated (panels A,B, E, and F) or 24-h AB-treated (panels C, G, D, and H) cultures from caspase 3 (−/−) mice (panels B,F, D, and H) or caspase 3 (−/+) mice (panels A, E, C, and G) were analyzed by TUNEL (panels A–D) or Hoechst staining (panels E–H) as descr"
https://openalex.org/W2111395353,"The determinants of ""basal"" activity of signaling pathways regulating cellular responses are poorly defined. One possibility is that cells release factors to establish the set-point of such pathways. Here we show that treatment of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with the nucleotidase apyrase decreases basal arachidonic acid release and cAMP production 30–40% and that inhibitors of P2Y receptor action also affect basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Changing medium prominently increases extracellular levels of ATP in Madin-Darby canine kidney, COS-7, and HEK-293 cells. Mechanical stimulation of ATP release likely occurs in virtually every experimental protocol with cultured cells, implicating such release and P2Y receptor activation as critical in establishing the set-point for signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1981231641,"Mcl-1 is a member of the Bcl-2 family that is regulated transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally, with expression of the full-length Mcl-1-encoded gene product resulting in enhanced cell survival. As reported here, the human Mcl-1 gene can also undergo differential splicing, which yields an internally deleted, death-inducing gene product, Mcl-1s/ΔTM. Whereas full-length Mcl-1 derives from three coding exons (instead of the two present in Bcl-2 and other anti-apoptotic members of this family), the Mcl-1s/ΔTM splice variant results from the joining of the first and third exons with skipping of the central exon. Because of the skipped exon and a shift in the reading frame downstream, the Bcl-2 homology domain (BH3) remains intact, whereas the BH1-, BH2-, and transmembrane-encoding domains do not. Mcl-1s/ΔTM thus has features similar to BH3 only, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and, accordingly, was found to promote cell death. In addition to a variety of other types of regulation, the Mcl-1 gene appears ideally designed for the generation of either a Bcl-2-like viability promoting or, as reported here, a BH3 only death-inducing gene product.

Bcl-2 homology transmembrane myeloid leukemia 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction kilobase 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid base pairs Apoptosis is a genetically determined cell death program that is critical for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in the healthy organism. Alterations in apoptosis contribute to the pathological effects seen in a variety of diseases, including cancer and inflammatory disease (1.Rudin C.M. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 267-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is controlled by evolutionarily conserved sets of genes with the Bcl-2 family playing a pivotal role (2.Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1693-1700PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 632-640Crossref Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). The members of this family fall into two groups with opposing functions. Pro-survival family members (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) inhibit apoptosis, whereas death-inducing members (e.g. Bax, Bid, and Bad) have the opposite effect. The family is characterized by domains of high sequence conservation, termed the Bcl-2 homology (BH)1 domains. Bcl-2 and other pro-survival family members contain BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains, which form a hydrophobic cleft (4.Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.L. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar) and appear critical for anti-apoptotic function (5.Yin X.M. Oltvai Z. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Whereas some death-inducing family members contain all three of these domains (e.g. Bax, Bak, and Bok (6.Hsu S.Y. Kaipia A. McGee E. Lomeli M. Hsueh A.J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This suggests that BH3 is a minimum requirement for pro-apoptotic function (9.Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 1998: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 10.O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), which probably relates to the fact that the exposed BH3 domain can bind to the hydrophobic cleft of pro-survival family members (11.Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan L.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). In addition to the BH domains, many family members contain a transmembrane (TM) domain at the C terminus. This anchors the protein to intracellular membranes, such as to the outer surface of mitochondria (12.Nakai M. Takeda A. Cleary M.L. Endo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13.Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol.

Although this domain may aid in targeting certain family members for function (16.Tanaka S. Saito K. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10920-10926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Borner C. Martinou I. Mattman C. Irmler M. Schaerer E. Martinou J.-C. Tschopp J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), a TM domain is not present in some death-inducing members, namely Bid and Bad (3.Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 632-640Crossref Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). In sum, the BH1/BH2/BH3 hydrophobic cleft and the TM anchor appear to contribute to anti-apoptotic activity, whereas the BH3 domain is critical for pro-apoptotic function. Mcl-1 is a Bcl-2 family member that was originally identified as a gene rapidly up-regulated early in the differentiation of a human myeloid leukemia cell line (ML-1) upon induction with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (PMA) (18.Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Mcl-1 expression has since been found to exhibit differentiation stage-specific expression in a variety of hematopoietic lineages as well as in epithelial tissues (19.Krajewski S. Bodrug S. Gascoyne R. Berean K. Krajewska M. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 515-525PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Krajewski S. Bodrug S. Krajewska M. Shabaik A. Gascoyne R. Berean K. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1309-1319PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Mcl-1 can be rapidly induced through anti-apoptotic cytokine-mediated pathways, such as those stimulated by hematopoietic cell colony-stimulating factors and interleukins (21.Townsend K.J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4883-4898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in neutrophils (26.Chuang P.I. Yee E. Karsan A. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), external stimuli that prolong the neutrophil life span (such as lipopolysaccharide and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) cause an increase in Mcl-1 expression (23.Moulding D.A. Quayle J.A. Hart C.A. Edwards S.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 2495-2502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Klampfer L. Zhang J. Nimer S.D. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An increase in Mcl-1 expression can be induced through a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent signal transduction pathway acting on SRF/Elk-1(21, 28), as well as through an Akt/ cAMP-response element-binding protein-regulated pathway (29.Wang J.M. Chao J.-R. Chen W. Kuo M.-L. Yen J.J.Y. Yang-Yen H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6195-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to regulation at a transcriptional level, the Mcl-1 mRNA can be rapidly turned over (30.Yang T. Buchan H.L. Townsend K.J. Craig R.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the upstream half of Mcl-1 contains PEST sequences, and the protein is likewise subject to rapid turn-over (15.Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The downstream half of the protein contains the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains and terminates in a TM domain (15.Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 18.Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Overall, Mcl-1 is a highly regulated gene product and is frequently expressed during particular stages of cell differentiation and/or in response to specific signals. Increased expression of the endogenous full-length Mcl-1 protein is associated with the maintenance of cell viability, and decreased expression with cell death (22.Lomo J. Blomhoff H.K. Jacobsen S.E. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Smeland E.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 4415-4424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Moulding D.A. Quayle J.A. Hart C.A. Edwards S.W.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Accordingly, transfection with a construct representing the full-length gene product results in enhanced cell survival, as seen both in the FDC-P1 hematopoietic cell line and in Chinese hamster ovary cells (32.Reynolds J.E. Yang T. Qian L. Jenkinson J.D. Zhou P. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6348-6352PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Reynolds J.E. Li J. Craig R.W. Eastman A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 34.Zhou P. Qian L. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. Blood. 1997; 89: 630-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enhancement of cell survival is seen in the presence of a variety of apoptosis-inducing stimuli and at levels of the introduced protein that are readily attainable endogenously. Conversely, loss of the expression of Mcl-1 is associated with cell loss (28.Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34.Zhou P. Qian L. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. Blood. 1997; 89: 630-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Rinkenberger J.L. Horning S. Klocke B. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 21-27Google Scholar). Similarly, in mice that express full-length Mcl-1 as a transgene in hematopoietic tissues (36.Zhou P. Qian L. Bieszczad C.K. Noelle R. Binder M. Levy N.B. Craig R.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 3226-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lymphoid (B and T) and myeloid cells exhibit enhanced survival, and the life span of mast cells and monocytes is dramatically prolonged. In sum, expression of the full-length BH1/BH2/BH3/TM-containing Mcl-1 gene product results in enhanced cell survival. Alternative splicing is increasingly being recognized to play a significant role in the regulation of proteins involved in cell death, occurring in a variety of death receptors, Bcl-2 family members, and cell death effectors such as caspases (37.Jiang Z.H. Wu J.Y. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 64-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-x can undergo alternative splicing to yield two forms (Bcl-xL and Bcl-xs) that have opposing biological functions. Bcl-x and Bcl-2 contain two coding exons separated by a conserved intron in the BH2 domain near the C terminus (38.Grillot D.A.M. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Bcl-xL, which is anti-apoptotic, derives from both of the coding exons in their entirety. Bcl-xS, which is pro-apoptotic, results from the use of an alternate upstream splice donor site that does not lie at an intron/exon border but rather lies within the first coding exon (38.Grillot D.A.M.

Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Other splice forms of Bcl-x also exist, and thus alternative splicing to a variety of different isoforms can occur even with a relatively simple gene structure (37.Jiang Z.H. Wu J.Y. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 64-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Fang W. Rivard J.J. Mueller D.L. Behrens T.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4388-4398PubMed Google Scholar). We are interested in the role that the Bcl-2 family plays in controlling cell life span in differentiating tissues, such as in the myeloid lineage (both monocytic and granulocytic branches) (42.Whyte M.K. Renshaw S.A. Lawson R. Bingle C.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 802-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and in epithelial tissues. Mcl-1 is of particular interest because of its highly regulated pattern of expression in these tissues (20.Krajewski S. Bodrug S. Krajewska M. Shabaik A. Gascoyne R. Berean K. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1309-1319PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Townsend K.J. Zhou P. Qian L. Bieszczad C.K. Lowrey C.H. Yen A. Craig R.W. J. Biol.

Chou C.K. Kuo M.L. Yen J.J. Yang-Yen H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4883-4898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the research presented here, we describe Mcl-1s/ΔTM, a splice variant of Mcl-1 that derives from exon skipping. Although the full-length human Mcl-1 gene product was found to consist of three coding exons (rather that the two coding exons seen in Bcl-2 and Bcl-x), the Mcl-1s/ΔTM variant represented joining of the first and third exons. This does not affect the BH3 domain in the first exon but does affect the BH1, BH2, and TM domains downstream because of the skipped second exon and a change in the reading frame downstream. The features of the Mcl-1s/ΔTM-encoded gene product are thus reminiscent of BH3 only pro-apoptotic family members such Bid and Bad. Accordingly, transfection with Mcl-1s/ΔTM was found to result in cell death. In addition to regulation at the level of both transcription and turn-over, the Mcl-1 gene appears ideally designed for the generation of either a Bcl-2-like viability promoting or a BH3 only death-inducing gene product. Human peripheral blood neutrophils and mononuclear cells were isolated from normal healthy donors by dextran sedimentation and plasma-Percoll gradient centrifugation as described previously (43.Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.A. Johnston R.B. Hennson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured in RPMI and 10% fetal calf serum in Teflon pools. Monocyte-derived macrophages were obtained by purification of peripheral blood neutrophils and mononuclear cells and adherence to tissue culture plasticware in serum-free medium for 1 h followed by culture for 4–5 days in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and 10% autologous serum (44.Savill J.S. Wyllie A.H. Henson J.E. Walpoort M.J. Henson P.M. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Established cell lines, ML-1, BL41–3, K562, Jurkat, A549, H441, HepG2, and MCF-7 were cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and penicillin. PMA stimulation of BL41–3 cells was performed using 1–50 ng/ml PMA applied for 2 or 6 h. Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood cells and cell lines by the RNAeasy system (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was generated by oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and under standard conditions (1 μg of RNA in a total volume of 50 μl). Aliquots (5 μl) were subjected to amplification with one of several sets of primers (Mcl-1-F3, 5′-GTT GGT CGG GGA ATC TGG TA; Mcl-1-F4, 5′-ATC TCT CGG TAC CTT CGG GA; Mcl-1-F5, 5′-GTA AGG AGT CGG GGT CTT CCC; Mcl-1-R4, 5′-AAA TTA ATG AAT TCG GCG GG; Mcl-1-R7, 5′-TCC TCT TGC CAC TTG CTT TTC). Reactions used the following primer combinations F3 and R4, F4 and R4, or F5 and R7. PCR was performed in a PCT2000 thermal cycler (MJ Research) for 30 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 60 s, annealling at 60 °C for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. Aliquots of the reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis in 1 or 2% agarose gels (Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer) and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The bands obtained with the F4/R4 and F5/R7 primer combinations were excised and cloned using the TOPO pCR II and bidirectional eukaryotic (pCR3.1) TA cloning systems (Invitrogen). Representative minipreps were chosen for sequence analysis using an ABI 373 automatic sequencer. A complete sequence was obtained from multiple clones. A 32P-labeled probe containing the entire Mcl-1 coding region (p3.2; (18.Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HL1006d (Palo Alto, CA)), using standard techniques. The resulting positive clones were characterized by restriction enzyme mapping. Selected restriction enzyme fragments were isolated from agarose gels, subcloned into the pBluescript SKII+ vector (Stratagene), and sequenced on both strands. Primer extension was carried out using an oligonucleotide primer complementary to the Mcl-1 coding region in its upstream portion (primer #105C primer, 5′-CCCCACAGTAGAGGTTGAGTCCGATTACCG-3′). Counting the ATG of the initiator methionine as the first through third nucleotides, the primer used represents nucleotides 23–52 (or nucleotides 77–106 of the p3.2 Mcl-1 cDNA (18.Kozopas K.M.

After 5′-end-labeling with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase, the primer (∼2 × 105 cpm) was hybridized to total RNA (20 μg) from ML-1 cells that had been treated with PMA to increase expression of the Mcl-1 mRNA (18.Kozopas K.M.

Hybridization was carried out at 30 °C for 14 h in 10 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 150 mm KCl and 1 mm EDTA. Reverse transcription with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) was carried out at 42 °C for 90 min in 50 mmTris-Cl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, deoxynucleotide triphosphates (0.25 mm each), and 0.15 μg/μl actinomycin D. After stopping the reaction by the addition of EDTA (to 20 μm), samples were treated with RNase A (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min, extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and subjected to gel electrophoresis. The S1 nuclease protection assay was carried out using a32P-labeled single-stranded DNA probe complementary to Mcl-1 in the upstream portion of the coding sequence and extending into the 5′-flanking region immediately upstream. This probe was prepared using a template representing single-stranded Mcl-1 genomic DNA derived from an M13 subclone containing the transcript strand of a 567 baseSacI-NotI Mcl-1 genomic subclone from this region (clone SN0.6, which extends from the NotI site within Mcl-1 exon 1 (see Fig. 2) to a SacI site ∼0.6 kb upstream). The32P-labeled #105C oligonucleotide primer used above was annealed to this template, and the extension reaction was carried out.

After alkaline-denaturing gel electrophoresis, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation, the resultant 5′-end-labeled single-stranded probe, 205 bases in length (2 × 105 CPM), was hybridized with total RNA (30 μg) from ML-1 cells treated with PMA (18.Kozopas K.M.

As a control, the probe was hybridized in parallel to yeast tRNA (20 μg). Hybridization (20 μl/reaction) was carried out at 30 °C in 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, containing 80% formamide, 400 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. After 14 h, the hybridization reaction mixture was diluted by the addition of 300 μl of S1 nuclease buffer (50 μm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, containing 0.28 m NaCl and 4.5 mmZnSO4) to which denatured calf thymus DNA (0.02 μg/μl) had been added. Digestion with S1 nuclease (300 units) was carried out at 30 °C for 60 min and was terminated by the addition of 80 μl of stop buffer (4 m ammonium acetate, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm EDTA and 40 μg/ml yeast tRNA). After ethanol precipitation and resuspension in formamide, the size of the protected fragments was assessed by gel electrophoresis on a DNA sequencing gel alongside a sequencing reaction carried out with the 105C primer and the SN0.6 M13 clone as template. The products of the primer extension reaction (above) were analyzed on the same gel.Figure 3Mcl-1 transcription initiates adjacent to tandem initiator sequences directly upstream of the first coding exon. A, Mcl-1 transcriptional start sites were mapped using primer extension analysis (products in lane 3, yeast tRNA control in lane 4) and S1 nuclease digestion (protected fragments in lane 2, yeast tRNA control in lane 1, probe in lane 5). The sequencing ladder (lanes A, T, G, and C) was generated using the #105C primer employed in the mapping (see “Materials and Methods”). The RNA used was from PMA-treated ML-1 human myeloid leukemia cells, the cell line from which Mcl-1 was originally cloned (18.Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Arrows to the left of the sequencing ladder indicate the two major positions where primer extension products were seen (120 and 130 bp upstream from the 5′-end of the #105C primer). The more abundant primer extension products were found at the position of thelower arrow, as opposed to the upper arrow 10 bp upstream. The lower position was thus designated +1. This position is indicated with an asterisk on the Mcl-1 coding sequence, which is listed in the column at the left. The sequence as listed includes the two tandem initiator sequences at 69–82 bp upstream of the start site of Mcl-1 translation (see Bbelow). The sequence of these initiators is CCACTTCTCACTTC, where the consensus for initiator sequences is YYAX(T/A)YY. The sequence in the right column is that of the complementary strand, which was that sequenced. The distance (bp) indicated at the right side of the gel represents the distance from 5′-end of the #105C primer. B, the sequence of the immediate 5′-flank of the human Mcl-1 gene is shown in comparison to the comparable region of the mouse Mcl-1 5′-flank. The tandem initiator sequences located 69–82 bp upstream of the start site of translation of the human gene aredouble underlined, where a similar sequence is present in the mouse sequence. The site designated as +1 in human Mcl-1 (seeA and under “Results”) is in bold and is indicated with an asterisk. The +1 site for mouse Mcl-1 is similarly indicated. The tandem initiator sequences lie in break between an upstream CpG-rich area (labeled and indicated with anarrows) and the G/C-rich first exon downstream (see Fig.2 A). The GGCCCC repeat region is dot underlinedand CpG pairs are in italics. The numbering inbold (in parentheses) indicates the position relative to the +1 site. The numbering that is not in bold refers to the numbering of the 8253 kb of sequenced human genomic Mcl-1 (diagrammed in Fig.2 A) or the corresponding sequenced area of the mouse Mcl-1 gene (25.Chao J.R.

A specific probe set was generated which contained probes to Bcl-x, A1, and Mcl-1. The Mcl-1 probe corresponded to positions 961 to 1107 in the human Mcl-1 cDNA sequence; this spans a region of the cDNA containing sequence from exons 2 and 3, part of which is deleted in Mcl-1s/ΔTM. Full-length wild-type Mcl-1 transcripts would be expected to yield a protected product of 146 bp, and the deleted Mcl-1s/ΔTM transcript a protected product of 109 bp. For positive controls in the hybridization reactions, mRNA was transcribed from the TOPO pCR II constructs containing wild-type Mcl-1 and Mcl-1s/ΔTM. tRNA was used as a negative control. As a control for RNA loading, samples were also hybridized with the hAPO-2 probe set (Pharmingen). The RNase protection analysis reactions were carried out as described in the protocol provided by the manufacturer, using 1–3 μg of total cell RNA and dilutions of the positive control RNAs. The reaction products were resolved on 5% sequencing gels in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA, which were then dried and exposed to film at −80 °C. For Western blotting, cell extracts were prepared using a bromphenol blue lysis buffer (containing 80 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 1 μm leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Electrophoresis (12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) was carried out with the equivalent of 1–3 × 105 cells being loaded in each lane, prestained rainbow markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) being run with each gel.

https://openalex.org/W2004547176,"The bacterial cell division protein FtsZ fromEscherichia coli has been purified with a new calcium precipitation method. The protein contains one GDP and one Mg2+ bound, it shows GTPase activity, and requires GTP and Mg2+ to polymerize into long thin filaments at pH 6.5. FtsZ, with moderate ionic strength and low Mg2+concentrations, at pH 7.5, is a compact and globular monomer. Mg2+ induces FtsZ self-association into oligomers, which has been studied by sedimentation equilibrium over a wide range of Mg2+ and FtsZ concentrations. The oligomer formation mechanism is best described as an indefinite self-association, with binding of an additional Mg2+ for each FtsZ monomer added to the growing oligomer, and a slight gradual decrease of the affinity of addition of a protomer with increasing oligomer size. The sedimentation velocity of FtsZ oligomer populations is compatible with a linear single-stranded arrangement of FtsZ monomers and a spacing of 4 nm. It is proposed that these FtsZ oligomers and the polymers formed under assembly conditions share a similar axial interaction between monomers (like in the case of tubulin, the eukaryotic homolog of FtsZ). Similar mechanisms may apply to FtsZ assembly in vivo, but additional factors, such as macromolecular crowding, nucleoid occlusion, or specific interactions with other cellular components active in septation have to be invoked to explain FtsZ assembly into a division ring.

Despite this information, FtsZ ring structure and assembly are still poorly understood. FtsZ binds guanine nucleotides and has GTPase activity (15.de Boer P. Cossley R. Rothfield L.

FtsZ self-assembles in vitro to form filaments and rings (23.Erickson H.P. Taylor D. Taylor K. Bramhill D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Electron microscopy studies of FtsZ filaments show that the longitudinal spacing in the polymers is close to the 4-nm spacing found in microtubules (23.Erickson H.P. Taylor D. Taylor K. Bramhill D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 24.Löwe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2364-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Similarly to microtubules (29.Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar) FtsZ assembly depends on divalent cations and guanine nucleotides and involves GTP hydrolysis (26.Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These physiological ligands have an important role in the control of the structure, associations, and assembly of tubulin. A high affinity Mg2+ bound to the non-hydrolyzable GTP of α-tubulin regulates the structural stability of the αβ heterodimer (30.Menéndez M. Rivas G. Dı́az J.F. Andreu J.M. J. Biol.

The hydrolyzable GTP bound to β-tubulin regulates tubulin assembly and microtubule dynamic instability, where several lower affinity Mg2+-binding sites are also implicated (31.Correia J.J. Baty L.T.

The processes of association and assembly seem to be relevant in the biological function of FtsZ. We have addressed the question whether the smallest association state of FtsZ in solution is a monomer or an oligomer. We have quantitatively characterized the effect of Mg2+ and Ca2+, ionic strength, and guanine nucleotides on the self-association of Escherichia coli FtsZ by means of analytical centrifugation (sedimentation equilibrium and velocity), and we have investigated the nature of the oligomeric species. CaCl2, MgCl2, EDTA, Tris, and glycerol, all of analytical grade, were from Merck. Guanine nucleotides, GDP and GTP, were from Sigma and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively.N-Acetyltyrosinamide was from Serva; guanidine hydrochloride was from Calbiochem, and fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate was from Molecular Probes Inc. Other analytical grade chemicals were from Merck or Sigma, except as otherwise indicated. In order to optimize FtsZ purification, in terms of protein purity, yield, and nucleotide bound, two methods have been compared. The first of them (Method 1) is a modification of the standard FtsZ purification by precipitation of this protein with ammonium sulfate followed by ion exchange (17.RayChaudhuri D. Park J.T. Nature. 1992; 359: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 44.Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The second one (Method 2), developed in this work, takes into account the dependence of FtsZ solubility on divalent cations (28.Yu X. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and the methods of tubulin isolation by cycles of Mg2+-induced association (45.Williams R.C. Lee J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The steps of cell growth and lysis were essentially the same in both methods. Briefly, FtsZ was overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with the plasmid pMFV56, which contains the E. coli ftsZ gene cloned in a pET-28a vector (Novagen). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB culture media (46.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with kanamycin, to anA 600 of 0.5–0.6. Expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside during 90 min (in Method 2, 180 min). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, during 15 min at 4 °C), and pellets were resuspended either in 50 ml of Tris glycerol buffer (Tris glycerol buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0) (Method 1) or in 20 ml of PEM buffer (PEM buffer, 50 mmPIPES,1 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5) (Method 2), and then the cells were lysed on ice using an MSE sonicator. The soluble fraction, containing the FtsZ protein, was separated from the cell debris by centrifugation (100,000 × g, for 2 h at 4 °C). In Method 1, the protein from the soluble fraction was precipitated with 30% ammonium sulfate. The sample was centrifuged (50,000 ×g, for 35 min at 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of Tris glycerol buffer. In Method 2, the protein was extracted by two cycles of Ca2+-induced precipitation. In the first cycle, 1 mm GTP and 20 mm CaCl2were added to the solution, and the sample was incubated during 15 min at 30 °C and then centrifuged (11,000 × g, for 15 min at 4 °C). The pellet, which contains FtsZ, was resuspended in 20 ml of PEM buffer and centrifuged as in the previous step to eliminate any insoluble material. The supernatant was subjected to an identical second cycle of Ca2+-induced precipitation. The final FtsZ pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of PEM buffer. The materials from the previous step, highly enriched in FtsZ protein but contaminated with nucleic acid, were further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a 5-ml Hi-Trap Q-Sepharose column (in an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min), equilibrated in Tris glycerol buffer either without adding MgCl2 (Method 1) or with 5 mm MgCl2(Method 2). FtsZ, due to its negative charge, was retained in the column and was eluted with a 0–100% gradient of 1 m KCl in the same buffer. In both cases the protein eluted around 500–600 mm KCl. The purified FtsZ aliquots were dialyzed either in Tris-200KCl buffer with 1 mm EDTA and 10% glycerol (Method 1) or in Tris-250KCl buffer with 10% glycerol (Method 2) and stored at −80 °C. We have chosen Method 2 to isolate FtsZ because of the following: (i) the purity in SDS-PAGE was >98%, whereas was only >95% for Method 1; (ii) the stoichiometry of nucleotide binding was also higher for FtsZ purified using Method 2 (1.1 ± 0.1 mol of bound GDP/mol of FtsZ, whereas only 0.6 ± 0.1 for FtsZ Method 1); and (iii) the protein yield (∼40 mg of protein/liter culture) was higher than that obtained with Method 1 (∼20 mg/liter). The GTPase activity of FtsZ purified by both methods was ∼120 nmol Pi·min−1·mg−1, which corresponds to 5 molecules of GTP hydrolyzed at 37 °C per min and molecule of FtsZ (at 5 μm protein). The determination of FtsZ concentration is not straightforward because the E. coli protein has few aromatic residues (only three tyrosines and no tryptophans (47.Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6024) Google Scholar)), and the bound nucleotide dominates the UV absorption spectrum. The nucleotide content of the protein was determined, after extraction with perchloric acid, by HPLC with an internal standard of guanosine, using an extinction coefficient of guanine nucleotides at 254 nm of 12,400 m−1cm−1 (31.Correia J.J. Baty L.T. Williams Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17278-17284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Dı́az J.F. Andreu J.M.

Two methods were employed to measure accurately the concentration of FtsZ at a given wavelength in the desired working buffer. This is important, for example, to measure the protein concentration gradients in analytical centrifugation experiments. FtsZ concentration was first measured by taking its UV spectra in 6 m GdnHCl. From these spectra the concentration of the protein (which has three Tyr) was calculated after subtracting the GDP contribution at 280 nm, using the following molar extinction coefficients: 1280 m−1cm−1 for Tyr (49.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar, 50.Pace C.N. Schmid F.X. Creighton T. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 253-259Google Scholar) and 8,100m−1 cm−1 for GDP. 2J. M. Andreu and J. F. Dı́az, unpublished data. Comparison with the spectra in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.5, buffer yielded practical molar extinction coefficients for the native protein-GDP complex at 280 (13,800 ± 900m−1 cm−1) and 254 nm (17,100 ± 1,100 m−1 cm−1). Note that these coefficients are only valid for FtsZ which has 1.1 ± 0.1 molecules of bound GDP. The intrinsic fluorescence signal of the Tyr residues of FtsZ was used to quantify FtsZ at low concentrations, since the emission spectra of the protein showed no fluorescent contaminants. The spectrofluorimetric measurements of FtsZ samples (diluted to <5 μm to avoid inner filter effects) in 6 m GdnHCl were performed at 20 °C in a Shimadzu RF-540 fluorimeter (λex = 275 nm; λem = 305 nm), with 0.5 × 1 cm cells, using N-acetyltyrosinamide (1–40 μm) as standard. This simple procedure gave the same results as UV spectroscopy within experimental error. Quantitative amino acid analysis (51.Ozols J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 587-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) was used to confirm the FtsZ quantitation methods previously described. The amino acid content of the protein was measured after acid hydrolysis (6 n HCl with norleucine as internal standard, at 110 °C, during 20 h) in a Beckman 630 automatic amino acid analyzer. The amino acid composition, in particular the number of phenylalanine and tyrosine residues, was in agreement with that calculated from the E. coli FtsZ gene sequence (47.Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6024) Google Scholar). By taking into account the total amino acid residues of FtsZ from sequence (as well as using the content of several reference residues, like alanine, glutamine + glutamate, and asparagine + aspartate), the number of moles of FtsZ in the original sample was calculated. This method understimated the FtsZ concentration by around 10% with respect to the spectrophotometric method. Finally, a colorimetric protein assay, using the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-25 reagent (Bio-Rad) had, in our hands, a poor reproducibility and overestimated the FtsZ content around 20%. The divalent cation content of FtsZ was measured in aliquots of 2 ml (25–50 μm) either directly from the stock solution stored in Tris glycerol buffer or after equilibrium dialysis in Tris-50KCl buffer (Tris-50KCl buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.5) at 20 °C. Measurements were performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (52.Martin M.T. Shapiro R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (53.Boss C.B. Fredeen K.J. Concepts, Instrumentation, and Techniques in Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry. Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT1997Google Scholar). Standard solutions of Mg2+ were purchased from Sigma, and Ca2+ stock solutions were prepared from a known amount of CaCO3. Only plasticware containers were employed, and all the solutions were prepared with fresh MilliQ grade water (Millipore Inc.). The GTPase activity of FtsZ (5 μm in Tris-100KCl buffer with 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mmGTP) was measured at 37 °C by quantitation of the inorganic phosphate with the malachite green-molybdate reagent (54.Hoenig M. Lee R.J. Ferguson D.C. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1989; 19: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 55.Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). The formation of large FtsZ polymers, after incubation of the protein (∼12.5 μm, in MES buffer (MES buffer, 50 mm MES-KOH, 50 mm KCl, pH 6.5)) with 1 mm GTP and 10 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C, was followed by 90° angle light scattering monitored with a High-Tech Scientific SS-51 stopped-flow device with a fluorescence detection system, employing 350 nm incident light and a filter with a cut-off below 330 nm for the scattered light. The dead time of the instrument was 2.5 ms, calibrated with the reaction ofN-bromosuccinimide with N-acetyltryptophanamide (56.Peterman B.F. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 442-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Light scattering at 90° was also monitored, using a Shimadzu RF-540 fluorimeter. FtsZ polymers were adsorbed to carbon-coated grids, negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and inspected with a Jeol 1200 EX electron microscope. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 20 °C in an Optima XL-A (Beckman-Coulter) analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with UV-visible optics, using An50Ti and An60Ti rotors, with either 12-mm double sector or six-channel centerpieces of Epon charcoal. FtsZ (loading concentration between 5 and 100 μm) was equilibrated in Tris-50KCl buffer, with 20 μm GDP and the desired concentration of divalent cations and KCl, except otherwise indicated (i.e. experiments at pH 6.5 in PIPES or MES buffers). Omission of GDP in the buffer resulted in the partial dissociation of the GDP bound to the protein within the experiment time interval. Short column (50–60 μl), low speed sedimentation equilibrium was performed at three successive speeds (5, 8, and 15,000 rpm), and the equilibrium scans were taken (typically after 10 h) at the most appropriate wavelength (240, 280, or 290 nm), depending upon the FtsZ concentration. Attention was given to the conservation of protein mass in soluble form during the experiment, and control sedimentation velocity experiments showed no aggregation within a 12-h time interval. In all cases, the base-line signals were measured after high speed centrifugation (40,000 rpm). Whole-cell apparent weight average molecular weights of FtsZ were obtained using the program EQASSOC (57.Minton A.P. Schuster T. Laue T. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar). The partial specific volume of FtsZ was 0.738 ml/g, calculated from the amino acid composition with the program SEDNTERP (retrieved from the RASMB server (58.Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S. Rowe A. Horton J. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar)). In order to quantitatively characterize the effect of Mg2+ on FtsZ self-association, the dependence of the weight average molecular weight ( Mw) of FtsZ on protein concentration was calculated 3The Turbo Pascal source code for this calculation and the MS-DOS executable program and the MATLAB scripts are available from one of the authors (A. Minton) upon request. from the local slopes of the transformed linearized data (lnc versus r 2) at defined radial intervals (57.Minton A.P. Schuster T. Laue T. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar). Data from different loading protein concentrations and equilibrium speeds were superimposed and averaged over an interval of ±0.1 log concentration units (59.Muramatsu N. Minton A.P. J. Mol. Recognit. 1989; 1: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 20 °C on parallel samples at 30,000, 40,000, and 50,000 rpm. Sedimentation coefficients were calculated either from the rate of movement of the solute boundaries, using the program XLAVEL (supplied by Beckman), or by globally fitting of multiple sedimentation velocity profiles with the program SVEDBERG (retrieved from the RASMB server (60.Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar)). From both methods we obtained similar apparent sedimentation coefficient values, which correspond to the maxima of the distribution of the apparent sedimentation coefficients, g(s*), calculated with the program DCDT (61.Stafford W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 478-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), also taken from the RASMB server. The average sedimentation coefficients were calculated by integration as shown in Equation 1. sw=∫0∞s∗g(s*)ds*∫0∞g(s*)ds*Equation 1 (See for example Ref. 62.Lobert S. Frankfurter A. Correia J.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8050-8060Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar.) These coefficients were corrected to standard conditions to get the correspondings 20,w values using the SEDNTERP program. Different self-association models containing adjustable parameters (see under “Theory”) were fitted to the weight average molecular weight versus concentration data via Marquardt-Levenberg minimization of χ2 (63.Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in Pascal: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, MA1989Google Scholar). Goodness of fit was evaluated from the statistical distribution of χ2for an identical number of degrees of freedom (see Chapter 14 of Ref.63.Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in Pascal: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, MA1989Google Scholar).3 The far-UV circular dichroism spectra of FtsZ (5–50 μm, equilibrated in Tris-50KCl buffer, with 20 μm GDP and a known concentration of MgCl2) were acquired at 20 °C in a JASCO J720 dichrograph, using 0.1- and 0.01-cm cells. Changes in FtsZ secondary structure were estimated by deconvolution of the CD spectra using Yang (64.Yang J.T. Chuen-Shang C.W. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar) and LIMCOMB (65.Perczel A. Parck K. Fasman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) methods, as described (19.de Pereda J.M. Leynadier D. Evangelio J.A. Chacon P. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14203-14215Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The nucleotide bound to FtsZ was exchanged by incubating GDP-FtsZ with a large molar excess of GTP and further removal of the unbound nucleotides by gel filtration, as described for tubulin (48.Dı́az J.F. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In the case of FtsZ, the gel filtration step was performed in Tris-50KCl buffer, with only 50 μm GTP, which permits us to follow the protein with the absorption optics in an analytical centrifuge. FITC labeling of FtsZ was performed essentially as described (66.Waggoner A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 362-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, FtsZ (∼30 μm) equilibrated in 20 mm phosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0, was incubated with the fluorophore (∼20 mol FITC/mol FtsZ) during 20–30 min at 20 °C. The unincorporated dye was separated from the labeled protein by gel filtration using a HiTrap desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in Tris-50KCl buffer. The degree of labeling (∼1–2 fluorescein/FtsZ) was determined spectrophotometrically. The purity of FtsZ was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrop"

The effect of these proteins on exon 9 exclusion was strictly dependent on the composition of the TGm and Tn polymorphic repeats.

This region, defined as the CFTR exon 9 intronic splicing silencer, is a target for serine-arginine-rich protein interactions. Thus, the nonevolutionary conserved CFTR exon 9 alternative splicing is modulated by the TGm and Tn polymorphism at the 3′ splice region, enhancer and silencer exonic elements, and the intronic splicing silencer in the proximal 5′ intronic region.

At this locus a variable number of dinucleotide TG repeats (from 9 to 13) followed by a T repeat (T5, T7, or T9) can be found in the normal population, and it has been suggested that the T5 allele is a disease mutation with incomplete penetrance that could be modulated by the simultaneous presence of other mutations and/or polymorphisms (3.Cuppens H. Lin W. Jaspers M. Costes B. Teng H. Vankeerberghen A. Jorissen M. Droogmans G. Reynaert I. Goossens M. Nilius B. Cassiman J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The pathologic effect of the T5 allele has been associated to the alternative splicing of the CFTR exon 9, which is extremely variable in humans among different individuals (9.Chu C.S. Trapnell B.C. Curristin S. Cutting G.R. Crystal R.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Interestingly, exon 9 skipping is absent in mouse, and it has been reported not to be evolutionary conserved (10.Delaney S.J. Rich D.P. Thomson S.A. Hargrave M.R. Lovelock P.K. Welsh M.J. Wainwright B.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This exon encodes part of the functionally important first nucleotide-binding domain, and its skipping produces a nonfunctional CFTR protein (10.Delaney S.J. Rich D.P. Thomson S.A. Hargrave M.R.

In CBAVD patients and normal subjects, several studies have established a good correlation between the number of TG (3.Cuppens H. Lin W. Jaspers M. Costes B. Teng H. Vankeerberghen A. Jorissen M.

Genet. 1993; 3: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) in the polymorphic locus and the amount of CFTR mRNA lacking exon 9. A high number of TG repeats and a low number of T repeats have been shown to favor the exclusion of exon 9 in the mRNA (3.Cuppens H. Lin W. Jaspers M. Costes B. Teng H. Vankeerberghen A. Jorissen M. Droogmans G. Reynaert I. Goossens M. Nilius B. Cassiman J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). However, the proportion of exon skipping does not correlate in some cases to the polymorphic alleles at the 3′ end of intron 9 (9.Chu C.S. Trapnell B.C. Curristin S. Cutting G.R. Crystal R.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), and it varies among tissues of the same subject (7.Teng H. Jorissen M. Van Poppel H. Legius E. Cassiman J.J. Cuppens H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This suggests that other factors operate in conjunction with the polymorphic locus to regulate the amount of exon 9 skipping. Multiple factors are indeed known to be involved in the regulation of alternative splicing through a complex network of interactions between splicing factors and pre-mRNA elements with both positive and negative effects on the exon recognition. In the last few years, different splicing factors belonging to the serine-arginine-rich (SR) family and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) have been shown to regulate the alternative splicing of many pre-mRNAs (12.Zahler A.M.

In general, SR proteins interacting with specific RNA elements located in exons positively regulate alternative splicing, whereas hnRNPA1 has an antagonistic effect commonly inhibiting splicing (12.Zahler A.M.

The characterization of the splicing factors and cis-acting elements involved in the regulation of human CFTR exon 9 alternative splicing is of key importance for the determination of the molecular basis of the skipping and consequently for the analysis of the phenotypic variability in patients with monosymptomatic forms of CF. To this end, we have developed an in vivo model system consisting of a reporter minigene by means of which the effect of the different CFTR alleles can be experimentally analyzed. With this system we have previously shown that the TGm and Tnrepetitions are directly involved and cooperate in exon 9 skipping and that intron 9 sequences can modulate the alternative splicing. In the present study we have carried out a functional analysis of the role of the regulatory trans-acting factors hnRNPA1 and members of the SR family on the alternative splicing of CFTR exon 9. Human genomic DNA was amplified with hcfIVS8dir 5′-ttttcatatggggccgctctaggacttgataatgggcaaatatctta-3′ and hcfIVS9rev 5′-cccctcgaccatatgctcgccatgtgcaagatacag-3′ to generate a fragment that contains exon 9 along with part of the flanking introns (154 bp for intron 8, 183 bp for exon 9, and 209 bp for intron 9). This fragment, which contains two additional NdeI sites at the ends, was subcloned in Sma-digested pBluescript plasmid. The mouse genomic regions containing exon 9 (154, 183, and 209 bp for intron 8, exon 9, and intron 9, respectively) were amplified from mouse genomic DNA with mCF8idir 5′-ttttcatatgtctagaaaccatgtgctttatagt-3′ and mCF9rev 5′-aaaacatatgataggttatccaatcttaagtgatcagttctaaacacgtgta-3′, which contain additional NdeI sites and subcloned in pBluescript plasmid. In both mouse and human constructs, at position +15 of exon 9, an EcoRI site was introduced by PCR-mediated site directed mutagenesis (A → C) to facilitate subsequent cloning procedures. By PCR-mediated site directed mutagenesis different Tn and TGm alleles were introduced at the 3′ end of intron 8 in the human construct with the use of antisense primers 5′-aaagaattccccaaatccctgtt(a)n(ca)mtcaaaaataaaagatgagtt-3′ (19.Niksic M. Romano M. Buratti E. Pagani F. Baralle F.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2339-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The construct hmCF was prepared cloning the humanEcoRI/XbaI cassette into the corresponding sites of the mouse construct. hm intron 9 plasmid was created by amplification of the mouse construct with M2CF9dir 5′-ctggatccactggagcaggcaaggtagt-3′ and an external primer in the pBS vector. The resulting fragment was digested with byBamHI/KpnI and subcloned in hCF TG11-T5. hm intron 9 3′ was created by two-step PCR overlap extension with CFPSTdir 5′-ttgtagtgctgcagtatcttactccttccatg-3′ and CFPSTrev 5′-agatactgcagcactacaaactagaa-3′ primers. To generate the expression vectors, we have previously used the α-globin-fibronectin EDA minigene (19.Niksic M. Romano M. Buratti E. Pagani F. Baralle F.E. Hum. Mol.

The CFTR intron 8-exon 9-intron 9 cassette between NdeI sites (both for human and mouse) was cloned in a modified version of the α-globin-fibronectin EDB minigene (17.Muro A.F. Caputi M. Pariyarath R. Pagani F. Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2657-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the original α-globin-fibronectin EDB minigene, the EDB exon along with part of the flanking introns (from NdeI in intron −1 toXbaI in intron +1) were deleted, and in the uniqueNdeI site created the CFRT inserts were cloned. Human CFTR gene was amplified with the direct primer int/A 5′-ctggatccactggagcaggca-3′ and the reverse primers h-int117 5′-atggtaccatatgtctcctaatgctcatgtaag-3′ or h-int 77 5′-atggtaccatatgccagcactacaaactaga-3′. The resulting fragments, digested with BamHI-KpnI, were subcloned in the corresponding sites of hCF Tg11-T5 to generate hCF Δint1 and hCF Δint2, respectively. Deletions inside CFTR exon9 were prepared by exchanging the EcoRI-BamHI cassette with amplified fragments obtained by PCR overlapping method with the following oligonucleotides: Sp1dir 5′-acttctaatggtaccctcttcttcagtaat-3′ with Sp1rev 5′-aagagggtaccattagaagtttttctattg-3′ for hCF Δ1 and Sp2dir 5′-tgaaagatatagaaagaggacagttg-3′ with Sp2 rev 5′-ctttctatatctttcaggacaggagt-3′ for hCF Δ2. The constructs hCF Δ2Δint1 and hCF Δ2Δint2 were obtained subcloning the hCF Δ2EcoRI/BamHI exon in the corresponding sites of hCF Δint1 and hCF Δint2, respectively. Hep3B cells were transfected with the DOTAP reagent with 3 μg of each reported plasmid and the control empty vector pCG (0.5 μg) (16.Caceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) or different amounts of splicing factors codifying plasmids. RNA extraction was performed after 48 h, and RT-PCR was done as described (17.Muro A.F. Caputi M. Pariyarath R. Pagani F. Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2657-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with the oligo 2–3 α 5′-caacttcaagctcctaagccactgc-3′ and B2 5′-taggatccggtcaccaggaagttggttaaatca-3′. For quantitation of the PCR reactions, [α-32P]dCTP was included in the PCR reaction mixture, and the products were loaded on 6% native polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager. The counts of each splicing band were corrected by the number of C/G present in the PCR product sequence. Because other regulatory elements, like the promoter architecture (20.Cramer P. Pesce C.G.

To generate the human intron 9 competitor RNAs, human CFTR gene was amplified with the direct primer int/A 5′-ctggatccactggagcaggca-3′ and each of the following reverse oligonucleotides: h-int 5′-atggtaccatatgctcgccatgtgcaagatacag-3′, h-int176 5′-atggtaccatatgaactagagtaaattatcag-3′, h-int117 5′-atggtaccatatgtctcctaatgctcatgtaag-3′, and h-int 77 5′-atggtaccatatgccagcactacaaactaga-3′. Mouse CFTR gene was amplified with int/A and m-int 5′-atggtaccatatgtgatcagttctaaacacgtgta-3′. The PCR products were digested with BamHI/KpnI and subcloned in the same restriction sites of pBS SK plasmid. The UV cross-linking assay was performed by adding [α-32P]UTP-labeled RNA probes (1 × 106 cpm/incubation) for 15 min at 30 °C with 20 μg of HeLa nuclear extracts prepared according to Ref. 22.Zerivitz K. Akusjarvi G. Gene Anal. Tech. 1989; 6: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar in 30 μl of final volume. Final binding conditions were 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 72 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.78 mm magnesium acetate, 0.52 mm dithiothreitol, 3.8% glycerol, 0.75 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, and 2 μg of Escherichia coli tRNA as a nonspecific competitor. In the competition experiments cold RNA (20-fold molar amount) was also added as a competitor 5 min before addition of the labeled RNAs. Samples were then transferred in the wells of an HLA plate (Nunc, InterMed) and irradiated with UV light on ice (800,000 kJ, approximately 5 min) using a BIO-LINK (Euroclone). Unbound RNA was then digested with 30 μg of RNase A (Sigma) and 6 units of RNase T1 (Sigma) by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in a water bath. Samples were then analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography.

To generate the RNA probe, human CFTR exon 9 gene was amplified with the direct primer h77dir 5′-tagagctcggaaggtatttttggagaaattctt-3′ and h-int, and the resulting fragment was subcloned in pBS SK. Electromobility retardation assay was performed by adding [α-32P]UTP-labeled h-int3 RNA probes (1 × 106 cpm/incubation) in a water bath for 15 min at 30 °C with the different protein extracts (both nuclear and SR protein preparations from HeLa cells). In 30 μl of final volume for each experiment, we used 18 μg of total nuclear extract and 1.5 μg of purified SR proteins. SR proteins were prepared from HeLa cells as described previously (25.Zahler A.M. Lane W.S. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). After 15 min we added to the reaction mixtures the specific mAb hybridoma supernatants followed by the incubation at 30 °C for a further 15 min. The reactions were performed in 1× bind shift binding buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) in the presence of heparin to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml and electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide 29:1) at 150 V for 3.5 h in 75 mm Tris-glycine buffer (1 m Tris-glycine buffer is 121.1 g of Tris base, 75 g of glycine, H2O up to 1 liter) at 4 °C. The gel was then dried on 3MM Whatman filter paper and exposed for 10–20 min with autoradiographic XAR film (Kodak). The alternative splicing of many pre-mRNAs is affected by the intracellular concentrations of antagonistic splicing factors of the SR family and hnRNPA1 (12.Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Lane W.S. Roth M.B. Science. 1993; 260: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 14.Mayeda A. Krainer A.R.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2657-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of these factors in the regulation of human CFTR exon 9 alternative splicing, we have prepared hybrid minigenes containing this exon as well as part of the flanking introns, including the different polymorphic TGmTn alleles (Fig.1 A). These variants were inserted in the well characterized α-globin/fibronectin reporter system (17.Muro A.F. Caputi M. Pariyarath R. Pagani F. Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2657-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Different cDNA plasmids coding for SF2/ASF, hnRNPA1, SRp20, SRp30c, SRp40, SRp55, SRp75, and SC35 were transiently expressed in Hep3B cells simultaneously with the transfection of reporter CFTR constructs. The effect of the expression of these regulatory proteins on the splicing of CFTR exon 9 was analyzed by RT-PCR amplification using specific primers. This procedure generates two bands of 239 and 422 bp that correspond to the exclusion or inclusion of exon 9, respectively. In the absence of overexpressed splicing factors, the construct containing TG11 and T5 repeats at the 3′ end of intron 8 produced about 65% of exon 9 inclusion. Overexpression of different splicing factors caused an increase in human CFTR exon 9 skipping (Fig. 1, B and C). SF2/ASF, SRp40, SRp55, and SRp75 inhibited the most, resulting in only ∼25% of mRNA containing the exon 9 (Fig. 1, B andC). These results provided the first evidence that different SR proteins and hnRNPA1 are important inducers of aberrant human CFTR exon 9 skipping in vivo. To analyze the effect of the polymorphic locus at the 3′ end of intron 8 on the negative role of splicing factors, minigene variants with different numbers of TG and T repeats were cotransfected along with the splicing factor SF2/ASF. To evaluate the relative sensitivity to inhibition by SF2/ASF of different alleles, we conducted dose-response studies (Fig.2). Increasing amounts of SF2/ASF plasmid transfected resulted in a greater amount of CFTR mRNA without exon 9 in all cases. However, the proportion of exon 9 exclusion was strictly dependent on the composition of the polymorphic locus. In fact, the number of TG and T repeats affected independently both basal and splicing factor-induced levels of exon 9 skipping (Fig. 2). For instance, the TG11-T9 construct produced 88% exon 9 inclusion with the addition of 500 ng of SF2/ASF plasmid, which was only 50 and 24% in the case of TG11-T7 and TG11-T5, respectively (Fig. 2, A andC). On a T5 background, an increasing number of TG repeats further reduced exon 9 inclusion (from 24% for TG11 to 3% for TG13) (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar dose-response curves were obtained with SRp55 and SRp75, whereas a lower efficiency of inhibition was observed for hnRNPA1 (data not shown), suggesting a different mechanism of splicing inhibition by this ribonucleoprotein as recently reported (26.Blanchette M. Chabot B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1939-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As a control, we cotransfected a hybrid minigene containing the fibronectin EDA exon along with the CFTR and ASF/SF2 constructs. The analysis of the splicing pattern of the EDA exon showed, as previously shown (21.Cramer P. Caceres J.F. Cazalla D. Kadener S. Muro A.F. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 251-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), that SF2/ASF produced a dose-dependent increase of exon inclusion, whereas the splicing of the CFTR exon was affected in the opposite way, as described above (Fig. 2 A). This indicates that the exon skipping of the human CFTR minigene induced by SR proteins is specific to the sequence of exon 9 and/or of its flanking introns and is modulated by the polymorphic locus. To identify the RNA elements in human CFTR mediating the negative regulation induced by the splicing factors, we have compared the human and mouse CFTR genes. As previously reported, the mouse gene is significantly different from the human one within the flanking introns of exon 9. Both TG and T repeats are absent at the intron 8-exon 9 junction, and in addition there are substantial sequence differences in the intron 9 (19.Niksic M. Romano M. Buratti E. Pagani F. Baralle F.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2339-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The mouse CFTR exon 9 and its flanking sequences were cloned in the same minigene construct used for the human exon and transfected along with increasing amounts of SF2/ASF splicing factor. Contrary to the human counterpart, the mouse CFTR exon 9 was not significantly skipped in the presence of SF2/ASF overexpression (Fig. 3,A and B, mCF). This result is consistent with the observed lack of alternative splicing of this exon (10.Delaney S.J. Rich D.P. Thomson S.A. Hargrave M.R. Lovelock P.K. Welsh M.J. Wainwright B.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We then prepared hybrid minigene constructs with parts of the human homologue inserted in the mouse context. These mouse-human hybrids were transiently transfected along with increasing amounts of SF2/ASF. The human intron 8 with the polymorphic repeats did not confer an SR protein-mediated inhibitory effect to the mouse exon, indicating that the human polymorphic tract is not by itself the target of this splicing factor (Fig. 3, A and B,hmCF). When intron 9 of the human construct was substituted with the corresponding intron from mouse, overexpression of SF2/ASF did not induce exon 9 skipping (Fig. 3, hm int9 3′). Similar results were obtained with SRp55 and SRp75 (data not shown). These data indicate that the inhibitory splicing effect of SR proteins is mediated by sequences present in the human but not in the mouse intron 9. To evaluate the functional significance of the human intron 9 in mediating the splicing inhibition the intronic sequences were progressively deleted and the corresponding hybrid minigenes transiently transfected in Hep3B cells. The partial or complete deletion (up to 77 bp from the 5′ splice site) of the intronic sequences leads to the complete disappearance of the CFTR exon 9 minus form, indicating that this regions behave like an intronic splicing silencer (ISS). When increased concentration of SF2/ASF plasmid were cotransfected, the CFTR exon 9 minus form was induced at a significant lower level than the amount present in the minigene, which contains the entire intronic element (Fig.4, minus lanes for Δint1 and Δint2). The splicing inhibition was related to the length of the deletion of the intron, suggesting the presence of multiple regulatory elements with inhibitory properties. These data are consistent with the role of the ISS in mediating the inhibitory activity, although the data also indicate that this is not the only element involved. Exonic regulatory elements have been found in different alternative spliced genes; hence we evaluated the presence of such elements in the CFTR exon 9 and their putative role in splicing inhibition. Deletion analysis was carried out on exon 9 selected chosen taking into account the RNA secondary structure of this region (19.Niksic M. Romano M. Buratti E. Pagani F. Baralle F.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2339-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), which in some cases have been found to be of critical importance (17.Muro A.F. Caputi M. Pariyarath R. Pagani F. Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2657-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cotransfection experiments in Fig. 4 identified two key exonic regulatory sequences behaving like an exonic splicing enhancer (hCFΔ1) and an exonic splicing silencer (hCFΔ2), respectively. Both elements modulate the response to SF2/ASF splicing inhibition. In fact the splicing inhibition mediated by SF2/ASF was completely prevented when both the exon (ESS) and the intron (ISS) silencers were deleted. Similar results were obtained with SRp55 and SRp 75 (data not shown). These data suggest that the two silencer elements are necessary for the splicing inhibition mediated by SR proteins. The"

Thus, sphingolipid-enriched microdomains could represent a site within the plasma membrane where different molecules (both lipids and proteins) involved in signal transduction and/or cell adhesion and cell-cell interactions are specifically sorted and concentrated, allowing reciprocal interactions of functional significance. Recent studies have revealed that gangliosides in membrane sphingolipid-enriched domains associate closely and specifically with single or multiple signal transducer molecules.

They are generally based on the characteristic low density of the domains, which allows their separation by density gradient centrifugation after cell disruption in the presence of detergent (Triton X-100), in hypertonic conditions or by mechanical procedures. Despite the variety of density gradient steps and of cell lysis procedures, results obtained with different methods are similar and lead to similar conclusions (1.Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A.

Most data concerning the structure and functional role of sphingolipid-enriched domains have been obtained from studies performed on non-neuronal cells such as Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (17.Brown D.A.

The lack of information on sphingolipid-enriched domains in the nervous system is mainly due to the complexity of this tissue at the cellular and compositional level. Moreover, the need to utilize primary cultures for neurons implies difficult work to collect enough cells for the analytical procedures. With this investigation we studied the composition of sphingolipid-enriched microdomains obtained from rat cerebellar granule cells differentiated in culture. To overcome the analytical problems related to the relatively limited number of cells, we radiolabeled the cellular lipids and proteins using appropriate radioactive precursors, namely [3H]sphingosine, [32P]ortophosphate, and [35S]methionine. Commercial chemicals were the purest available, common solvents were distilled before use, and water was doubly distilled in a glass apparatus. Trypsin, crystalline bovine serum albumin, and all the reagents for cell culture were from Sigma, except for basal modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum, which were purchased from Flow Laboratories. Anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal IgG2bantibody and protein A/G PLUS-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Sphingosine was prepared from cerebroside (37.Carter H.E. Rothfus J.A. Gigg R. J. Lipid. Res. 1961; 2: 228-234Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Sphingolipids and glycerolipids to be used as standards were extracted from rat brain, purified, and characterized (38.Tettamanti G. Bonali F. Marchesini S. Zambotti V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 296: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). [1-3H]Sphingosine was prepared by specific chemical oxidation of the primary hydroxyl group of sphingosine followed by reduction with sodium boro[3H]hydride (39.Toyokuni T. Nisar M. Dean B. Hakomori S. J. Labeled Compd. Radiopharm. 1991; 29: 567-574Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (radiochemical purity, >98%; specific radioactivity, 2 Ci/mmol). [32P]Orthophosphate (carrier-free) and [35S]methionine (specific radioactivity, 1175 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and NEN Life Science Products, respectively. 3H-Labeled lipids, ceramide, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine, and lactosylceramide were extracted from [1-3H]sphingosine-fed cells, purified, characterized, and used as chromatographic standards. Granule cells obtained from the cerebellum of 8-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared and cultured as described (40.Gallo V. Ciotti M. Coletti A. Aloisi F. levi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). It is reported (40.Gallo V. Ciotti M. Coletti A. Aloisi F. levi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at a density of 9 × 106 cells/dish and cultured with 10 ml of basal modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 8 days. Experiments were performed between 6th and 8th day in culture. Typical protein content at this time was 700 μg of protein/dish. Viability was assessed by the Trypan blue exclusion method. Cells at the 6th day in culture were incubated in the presence of 3 × 10−8m[1-3H]sphingosine (5 ml/dish) in cell-conditioned medium for 2 h (pulse). After the pulse, medium was replaced with cell-conditioned medium without radioactive sphingosine, and cells were further incubated for 48 h (chase). Under these conditions all sphingolipids (including ceramide, sphingomyelin, neutral glycolipids, and gangliosides), and phosphatidylethanolamine (obtained by recycling of radioactive ethanolamine formed in the catabolism of [1-3H]sphingosine) were metabolically radiolabeled (42.Chigorno V. Riva C. Valsecchi M. Nicolini M. Brocca P. Sonnino S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells at the 7th day in culture were preincubated in methionine-free medium for 2 h and subsequently incubated in the presence of 25 μCi/ml l-[35S]methionine (5 ml/dish) for 20 h to radiolabel proteins (18.Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 43.Fries E. Ahlström E. Jonasson I. Persson R. Biochem. Int. 1988; 16: 737-745PubMed Google Scholar). Cells at 8th day in culture were incubated in the presence of 50 μCi/ml carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (5 ml/dish) in phosphate-free culture medium for 4 h (44.Sarafian T. Verity A.M. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, glycerophospholipids (with the exclusion of phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen and including the minor inositol containing compounds) and phosphoproteins were radiolabeled. After metabolic radiolabeling, at the 8th day in culture, cells were subjected to ultracentrifugation on discontinuous sucrose gradient after lysis and homogenization in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 or in hypertonic sodium carbonate medium as described previously (2.Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 3.Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells (5–8 × 107) harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4 mmNa3VO4, were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 75 milliunits/ml aprotinin, allowed to stand on ice for 20 min, and treated with a Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes, tight). Cell lysate was centrifuged (5 min at 1,300 × g) to remove nuclei and large cellular debris. The postnuclear fraction was mixed with an equal volume of 85% sucrose (w/v) in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm Na3VO4. The resulting diluent was placed at the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose concentration gradient (30–5%) in the same buffer and centrifuged (17 h at 200,000 × g) at 4 °C. Cells were harvested as described above, suspended (8–10 × 107 cells/ml) in 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0, and homogenized using a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes) and a probe sonicator (three 10-s bursts). 1.5 ml of the cell homogenate thus obtained was mixed with an equal volume of 90% sucrose in 25 mmMES,2 pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl and overlaid with a discontinuous sucrose gradient (30–5%) in the same buffer containing 250 mm sodium carbonate. Samples were subjected to ultracentrifugation as described above. Using both procedures, a white light-scattering band under light illumination located at the interface between 5 and 30% sucrose was detectable. After ultracentrifugation, eleven 1-ml fractions were collected starting from the top of the tube. The light-scattering band corresponded to fraction 5 and was regarded as the sphingolipid-enriched fraction. The bottom fraction (fraction 11) contained a pellet that was carefully homogenized before analysis. The entire procedure was performed at 0–4 °C in ice immersion. Cell lysates and sucrose gradient fractions obtained after labeling cerebellar granule cells with [32P]orthophosphate or [35S]methionine were analyzed to determine protein content and pattern. In the case of [32P]orthophosphate labeling, samples were extensively dialyzed to remove free [32P]phosphate, and phospholipids were removed by chloroform/methanol extraction (45.Riboni L. Bassi R. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) before analysis. Similar amounts of protein for each sample (0.2–1 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels followed by radioactivity detection. The qualitative and quantitative determination of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins was by immunoprecipitation. Aliquots of each fraction obtained from cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate or [35S]methionine (containing ∼15–30 μg of protein) were diluted 10-fold in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 75 milliunits/ml aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100), mixed with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (40 μl packed), and stirred on a rotary stirrer for 2 h at 4 °C to preclear nonspecific binding. After centrifugation (270 × g for 2 min), 2 μg/ml mouse anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal IgG2b or 2 μg/ml normal mouse IgG (as negative control) was added to the supernatants. The mixtures were placed on a rotary stirrer overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by adding protein A/G-Sepharose beads (40 μl packed) and mixing for 2 h. Beads were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, recovered by brief weak centrifugation (270 ×g for 2 min), suspended in 50 μl of SDS-sample buffer, heated to 95 °C for 3 min, and centrifuged (1000 ×g for 2 min). Supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and dried gels were analyzed to determine the radioactive protein patterns. The radioactivity associated with immunoprecipitates was quantitatively determined by liquid scintillation counting. The total amount of immunoprecipitable radioactivity was calculated for each fraction and for the cell lysate. Data were expressed for each fraction as the percentages of total immunoprecipitable radioactivity present in the amount of cell lysate loaded on gradient. Radioactivity associated with negative controls never exceeded 5% of radioactivity found in immunoprecipitates. The cell lysate, postnuclear supernatant, and sucrose gradient fractions obtained after cell metabolic radiolabeling were analyzed to determine the content of radiolabeled lipids. Samples were dialyzed for 4 days against distilled and decarbonated water (changed two times a day). We found that a long dialysis of samples before lipid extraction is necessary for effective removal of sucrose and that the removal of sucrose is critical for the quality of lipid extraction and analysis. After dialysis, samples were lyophilized, and lipids were extracted twice with 0.5 ml of chloroform/methanol, 2:1 (v/v) (45.Riboni L. Bassi R. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The total lipid extract was not subjected to partitioning to avoid any possible loss of material. Aliquots of the lipid extract were analyzed by HPTLC as described below, followed by radioactivity imaging for quantification of radioactivity Identity of lipids separated by HPTLC was assessed by co-migration with standard lipids and confirmed by susceptibility of compounds to the following enzymatic and chemical treatments. A sample of the lipid extract was treated at 37 °C for 2 h in 50 μl of water in the presence of 1 milliunit of Vibrio cholerae sialidase to yield GM1. Sphingomyelin and phosphatidylethanolamine were purified according to the HPTLC blotting technique previously reported (46.Taki T. Handa S. Ishiwaka D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); they were separated by HPTLC, identified by spraying with primulin, blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane where the corresponding bands were cut, and subjected to elution. Sphingomyelin was treated at 37 °C overnight in 30 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, in the presence of 11 milliunits of Bacillus cereussphingomyelinase, to yield ceramide; phosphatidylethanolamine was characterized following its degradation under alkaline conditions. The enzymatic or chemical reaction mixtures were separated by HPTLC, and the reaction products were identified by chromatographic comparison with standard lipids. 3H-Labeled lipids were separated by monodimensional HPTLC carried out with the solvent systems chloroform/methanol/0.2% aqueous CaCl2, 50:42:11 or 55:45:10 (v/v/v).32P-Labeled lipids were separated by mono- or bidimensional HPTLC using the following solvent systems and conditions. For monodimensional HPTLC, chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water, 30:20:2:1 (v/v/v/v) and chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water, 40:15:13:12:8 (v/v/v/v) were used to specifically analyze the content of phosphatidylinositol phosphates. The separation was carried out on HPLTC plates that were previously impregnated with a 1.3% solution of potassium oxalate in methanol/water, 2:3 (v/v), dried at room temperature, and activated at 110° for 15 min. For bidimensional HPTLC, in the first run, chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water, 30:20:2:1 (v/v/v/v) was used; after the run plates were dried and exposed to HCl fumes for 15 min, they were dried again. For the second run, chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water, 10:2:4:2:1 (v/v/v/v) was used; this bidimensional HPTLC system allowed the analysis of plasmalogens in the glycerophospholipid mixture. Also for bidimensional HPTLC, for a first run, chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water, 30:20:2:1 (v/v/v/v) was used. For the second run chloroform/methanol/water/32% NH4OH, 48:40:7:5 (v/v/v/v) was used. Cholesterol was separated by monodimensional HPTLC using the solvent system hexane/diethylether/acetic acid, 80:20:1 (v/v/v). Cholesterol was quantified after separation on HPTLC followed by visualization with 15% concentrated sulfuric acid in 1-butanol. The quantity of cholesterol was determined by densitometry and comparison with known amounts of standard cholesterol using the Molecular Analyst program (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The protein content was determined according to Lowry (47.Lowry O.H. Rosebro"
https://openalex.org/W2157230199,"Myeloperoxidase is a heme enzyme of neutrophils that uses hydrogen peroxide to oxidize chloride to hypochlorous acid. Recently, it has been shown to catalyze nitration of tyrosine. In this study we have investigated the mechanism by which it oxidizes nitrite and promotes nitration of tyrosyl residues. Nitrite was found to be a poor substrate for myeloperoxidase but an excellent inhibitor of its chlorination activity. Nitrite slowed chlorination by univalently reducing the enzyme to an inactive form and as a consequence was oxidized to nitrogen dioxide. In the presence of physiological concentrations of nitrite and chloride, myeloperoxidase catalyzed little nitration of tyrosyl residues in a heptapeptide. However, the efficiency of nitration was enhanced at least 4-fold by free tyrosine. Our data are consistent with a mechanism in which myeloperoxidase oxidizes free tyrosine to tyrosyl radicals that exchange with tyrosyl residues in peptides. These peptide radicals then couple with nitrogen dioxide to form 3-nitrotyrosyl residues. With neutrophils, myeloperoxidase-dependent nitration required a high concentration of nitrite (1 mM), was doubled by tyrosine, and increased 4-fold by superoxide dismutase. Superoxide is likely to inhibit nitration by reacting with nitrogen dioxide and/or tyrosyl radicals. We propose that at sites of inflammation myeloperoxidase will nitrate proteins, even though nitrite is a poor substrate, because the co-substrate tyrosine will be available to facilitate the reaction. Also, production of 3-nitrotyrosine will be most favorable when the concentration of superoxide is low."
https://openalex.org/W1999684167,"Chemokines are a group of small proteins that have a variety of functions, including the activation and recruitment of immune cells during episodes of inflammation. In common with many cytokines, it has been observed that chemokines have the potential to bind heparin-like glycosaminoglycan molecules, which are normally expressed on proteoglycan components of the cell surface and extracellular matrix. The significance of this interaction for chemokine activity remains a subject of debate. In this study, Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected separately with the human chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5, and these receptors were shown to induce an intracytoplasmic Ca2+ flux and cellular chemotaxis following stimulation with the natural CC chemokine ligands (MIP-1α, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed), and MIP-1β). In further experiments, mutant CHO cells, with a defect in normal glycosaminoglycan (GAG) expression, were also transfected with, and shown to express similar levels of, CCR1 and CCR5. Although these receptors were functional, it was found that the mutant cells required exposure to higher concentrations of ligands than the wild-type cells in order to produce the same intracytoplasmic Ca2+ flux. Radioligand binding experiments demonstrated that specific chemokine receptors expressed by wild-type cells had a significantly greater affinity for MIP-1α than similar receptors expressed by GAG-deficient mutants. However, there was no significant difference between these cells in their affinity for RANTES or MIP-1β. In conclusion, it has been demonstrated clearly that GAG expression is not necessary for the biological activity of the chemokines MIP-1α, RANTES, or MIP-1β. However, the presence of cell surface GAGs does enhance the activity of low concentrations of these chemokines by a mechanism that appears to involve sequestration onto the cell surface.

Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar, 2.Butcher E.C. Picker L.J. Science. 1996; 272: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar, 3.Kirby J. Tilney N.L. Strom T.B. Paul L.C. Transplantation Biology: Cellular and Molecular Aspects. Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 137-149Google Scholar). It is becoming clear that this process is regulated principally by cytokine molecules termed the chemokines (4.Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar). The chemokines are a family of small chemoattractant proteins that are capable of activating and promoting vectorial migration of a variety of leukocytes. They can be grouped into four subfamilies on the basis of the disposition of conserved cysteine residues; these are termed the C, CX3C, CC, and CXC groups (5.Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Advances Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar, 7.Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B.

The C and CX3C groups each have only one known member, whereas the CC and CXC groups have many members. The CC (or β-) chemokines, in which the first two conserved cysteine residues are adjacent, are believed to be the most important mediators of mononuclear cell inflammation. Chemokines bind to receptors of the seven-transmembrane-spanning type and also bind to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs),1 including heparan sulfate (9.Witt D.P. Lander A.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 394-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 10.Tanaka Y. Aso M. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1998; 10: 153-160Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Nine receptors for CC chemokines (CCRs) have been identified (11.Husman A.M.D. Schuitemaker H. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 244-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12.Bonini J.A. Martin S.K. Dralyuk F. Roe M.W. Philipson L.H. Steiner D.F.

Med. 1996; 2: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar); however, in vitro studies have shown some redundancy with more than one chemokine binding to a given receptor and several receptors being able to bind a single chemokine. Previous in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated clearly that chemokines provide directional cues. However, the mechanism by which the chemokine concentration gradient required for cellular chemotaxis is maintained remains unclear. A gradient of soluble chemokine would not be expected to remain stable in vivo, particularly under conditions of blood flow at the endothelial surface, although it is known that the CXC chemokine, IL-8, retains its ability to induce neutrophil migration after adsorption onto a solid phase support (14.Rot A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the potential for binding to GAG components of proteoglycans, either at the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix, might allow formation of an immobilized chemokine gradient for presentation to leukocytes. In support of this, Gilat et al.(15.Gilat D. Hershkoviz R. Mekori Y.A. Vlodavsky I. Lider O. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4899-4906PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that MIP-1β and RANTES bind to an ex vivoextracellular matrix preparation in a heparinase-sensitive manner, and that these bound chemokines are capable of stimulating leukocyte activation. A number of growth factors and proinflammatory cytokines have been shown to bind to GAGs (16.Tanaka Y. Kimata K. Adams D.H. Eto S. Proc. Assoc. Am. Phys. 1998; 110: 118-125PubMed Google Scholar); these include acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (17.Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar), several chemokines (18.Luster A.D. Greenberg S.M. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), interferon-γ (19.Lortatjacob H. Grimaud J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and several of the interleukins (10.Tanaka Y. Aso M. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1998; 10: 153-160Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). While the functional implications of these interactions are not fully understood, it has been proposed that proteoglycans protect these small molecules from degradation, act as cytokine storage sites, or aid presentation to specific cell-signaling receptors. The presentation hypothesis suggests that chemokines are presented to leukocytes in the form of a solid-phase gradient while bound to immobile GAGs. Hence, it is possible that chemokine-GAG interactions are important not only for receptor presentation but also for target cell activation in vivo. The relationship between chemokine-GAG interactions and activity has been addressed in only a few studies. Maione et al. (20.Maione T.E. Gray G.S. Hunt A.J. Sharpe R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2077-2083PubMed Google Scholar) have presented evidence that a non-GAG binding mutant of the CXC chemokine PF4, in which four basic residues in the C-terminal helix are changed to acidic or neutral residues, retains both in vitroanti-angiogenic activity and in vivo anti-tumor activity. These results indicate that for PF4, heparin binding capacity and biological activity is not directly related. By contrast, IL-8 with a truncated C-terminal helix fails to bind heparin and has impaired cell activation and receptor binding properties (21.Webb L.M.C. Ehrengruber M.U. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Rot A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7158-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). It is known that the heparin binding site on human IL-8 is spatially distinct from the residues involved in receptor binding, which suggests that GAGs may play a role in presenting IL-8 to its receptors (22.Kuschert G.S.V. Hoogewerf A.J. Proudfoot A.E.I. Chung C-W. Cooke R.M. Hubbard R.E. Wells T.N.C. Sanderson P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11193-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) in a manner similar to that proposed for basic fibroblast growth factor (23.Moy F.J. Safran M. Seddon A.P. Kitchen D. Bohlen P. Aviezer D. Yayon A. Powers R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4782-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, a recent study used a non-heparin-binding mutant of the CC chemokines MIP-1α and MIP-1β to demonstrate that GAG binding is not a prerequisite for receptor ligation and signal transduction in vitro (24.Koopmann W. Krangel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10103-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25.Koopmann W. Ediriwickrema C. Krangel M.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2120-2127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, a GAG-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant (745-CHO) and the corresponding wild-type cell (K1-CHO) were each transfected separately with the human chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5. This allowed examination of ligand-induced signaling through a single receptor and direct investigation of the contribution of GAG molecules to receptor affinity and cellular activation. Professor Jeffrey Esko (Department of Biochemistry, University of Alabama at Birmingham) kindly supplied the CHO cell lines used in the present study. Wild-type CHO cells (K1-CHO) and the proteoglycan-deficient variant pgsA-745 (745-CHO), which makes little if any cell surface proteoglycan (26.Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), were each maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum; the cells were subcultured every 3–4 days. A DNA fragment encoding the entire open reading frame of human CCR1 was amplified by reverse transcription-coupled PCR using RNA prepared from freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a healthy adult volunteer. The sense and antisense primers used for the amplification were (5′-CCATGGAAACTCCAAACACC-3′ and 5′-CCTACATCAGTGTCTCC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was subsequently cloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) before CCR1 was excised on aBamHI/BglII restriction fragment and subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pSRα. The sequence of the resulting construct was verified by DNA sequence analysis. A plasmid containing the full-length human chemokine receptor CCR5 was kindly provided by Dr. M. Parmentier (IRIBHN, Universite libre de Bruxelles, Belgium). CCR1 and CCR5 transfectants were generated for both the mutant and wild-type CHO cell lines by electroporation. Stable transfectants were selected by culture in medium supplemented with G418 (600 μg/ml; Calbiochem). Individual G418-resistant colonies were picked and expanded. The antibodies used for immunofluorescence flow cytometric analysis were 2D7/CCR5 (anti-CCR5, murine monoclonal; Becton Dickinson) and H-52 (anti-CCR1, rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Control and transfected cells were labeled with an optimal concentration of the appropriate antibody at 4 °C for 20 min, washed, and counterstained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for a further 20 min. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSort; Becton Dickinson). Data analysis was performed using Lysis II software (Becton Dickinson). An irrelevant, isotype-matched antibody (IgG1, X931; Dako) was used as a negative control in each labeling experiment. Chemotaxis assays were performed using CCR-transfected and untransfected K1-CHO cells. MIP-1α was obtained from R & D Systems (Abingdon, Oxon, UK), dissolved at 10 μg/ml in sterile phosphate-buffered saline and diluted to between 1 and 10 nm in HEPES-buffered RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. This chemokine was placed in the lower well of a 24-well transwell system (Falcon). The CHO cells were suspended at 2 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 1% bovine serum albumin and added to the upper chamber in a volume of 50 μl. The two chambers were separated by a polycarbonate filter with 8-μm pores, which was precoated with type IV collagen. The chamber was incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After this time, the filter was stripped to remove cells from the upper surface, and the cells on the underside were fixed with methanol and stained with hemotoxylin. Quantification of the chemotaxis was performed by counting the mean number of migrant cells per high power field. All assays were performed in triplicate. Wild-type and mutant CHO transfectants were grown on 10-mm coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates until confluent. The coverslips were then removed and transferred in Petri dishes, and the cells were loaded with Fura-2 (Sigma) by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of medium containing 3 μg/ml of the acetoxymethylester form of the dye (diluted from 1 mg/ml stock in dimethyl sulfoxide). The cells were then washed with fresh medium to remove excess dye before the coverslips were mounted in a superfusion chamber on the stage of a microspectrofluorimeter based on a Nikon Diaphot epifluorescence microscope fitted with an excitation filter changer and multipoint imaging system. Up to 16 single cells were monitored per experiment. Cells were temperature-equilibrated for 5 min and superfused with balanced salt solution (140 mm NaCl, 4.5 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNaH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at a rate of approximately 5 ml/min. During this time, the basal fluorescence spectrum was observed. Chemokines were added to the chamber at concentrations between 0.5 and 100 nm, and the fluorescence was monitored. The results were collected every 1.5 s as the ratio of the fluorescence signal at 500 nm following excitation at 340 nm to that at 380 nm. ATP (1 μm; Sigma) was used at the end of each experiment for positive control. Each experiment was repeated three times on different days with similar results for each clone. Before assay each of the transfectant cell lines was seeded in flat-profile 96-well plates at 5000 cells/well in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and allowed to attach for 48 h. After this period, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was removed by aspiration. Cold ligand competition assays were performed in a total volume of 150 μl (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 10 mmHEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) using 100 pm125I-MIP-1α, 125I-RANTES, or125I-MIP-1β and a variable concentration of the corresponding unlabeled chemokines. After incubation of the cells at 37 °C for 90 min, the plate was washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES and 0.5 m NaCl to remove the unbound 125I-chemokines. The cells were then lysed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h in a solution containing 1% SDS and 1 m NaOH. The lysed cells were transferred to test tubes, and the radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. Radioligand binding parameters were calculated using Prism 3 software (GraphPad). The effect of the soluble GAGs, heparin, heparan sulfate, and CS-A on chemokine binding was investigated by the addition of these molecules at concentrations between 0 and 250 μg/ml at the time of radioligand binding. All results are expressed as mean ± S.D. (or S.E.) of the corresponding replicates. The significance of changes in receptor affinity by various ligands was assessed by the application of Student's t test. Data were stored and analyzed using Prism 3 software. The K1-CHO and 745-CHO cell lines formed monolayers in culture and showed cobblestone morphology typical of epithelioid cells. The plasmids pSRα-CCR1 and -CCR5 were transfected separately into the K1-CHO and 745-CHO cell lines. Following selection for G418 resistance, at least 20 colonies from each transfection of each cell line were picked for expansion. Clones were examined by immunofluorescence flow cytometry to compare surface expression of CCR1 or CCR5; those expressing approximately equal levels of each receptor were chosen for further study. Neither CCR1 nor CCR5 was detectable in mock-transfected cell lines. Representative immunofluorescence results for CCR5 expression are shown in Fig. 1; in each case, the median fluorescence for the transfected cells was similar. Similar data (not shown) was collected for the CCR1 transfectants. This assay was performed to determine whether the CCR-transfected CHO cells contained all the intracellular molecules required for chemokine-receptor signal transduction. The results showed that both K1-CCR1 and K1-CCR5 cells were able to migrate in response to chemotactic stimulation by MIP-1α and RANTES or MIP-1α, RANTES, and MIP-1β, respectively. Wild-type untransfected cells were unresponsive to chemokine stimulation in this assay. These experiments were carried out with agonist concentrations between 0.01 and 100 nm; limited migration occurred at 1 nm, but it reached a maximal level at 10 nm. Representative results for K1-CCR1- and K1-CCR5-expressing cells are shown in Fig.2. Having established that K1-CHO transfectants have all the components necessary for chemokine-mediated intracellular signal transduction, a series of chemotaxis experiments was performed to compare the chemokine sensitivity of CCR-expressing wild-type cells (K1-CHO) with that of the 745-CHO transfectants. At an agonist concentration of 10 nm, the number of cells (745-CCR1 and 745-CCR5) migrating in response to chemotactic stimulation were significantly less than number of migrating wild-type transfectants (Fig. 2). 745-CCR5 and 745-CCR1 did not yield a typical bell-shaped dose-response curve, and the number of migrating cells was still increasing at agonist concentrations of 100 nm (data not shown). A series of experiments was performed to determine whether the transfected CCR1 and CCR5 receptors could induce an intracellular Ca2+ flux following stimulation by MIP-1α at 100 nm. Control cells, which had been transfected with vector alone, did not respond to MIP-1α (Fig.3 a). However, it was found that both the K1-CCR1 and K1-CCR5 cells showed a rapid and transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ following stimulation with this chemokine (Fig. 3, b and c). All of these cells showed a positive control response following stimulation with ATP. Following stimulation with a high concentration (100 nm) of MIP-1α, both the K1-CCR1 and the 745-CCR1 cells showed a similar Ca2+ flux (Fig.4 a); similar results were observed for K1-CCR5 and 745-CCR5 cells (Fig. 4 b). However, examination of the MIP-1α dose-response curve for both CCR1 and CCR5 transfectants (Fig. 4) showed an EC50 for K1-CCR1 and 745-CCR1 of 1.5 and 8 nm, whereas the corresponding EC50 values for the K1-CCR5 and 745-CCR5 were 1.10 and 10.0 nm, respectively. Table I shows that significant differences in EC50 were also observed for these cells following stimulation with RANTES (CCR1 transfectants) or both RANTES and MIP-1β (CCR5 transfectants). These data show that the expression of GAGs is not a prerequisite for CCR1 or CCR5 signaling in vitro. However, the presence of GAG molecules does appear to increase the sensitivity of the transfectants to chemokine stimulation by between 4- and 9-fold.Table IDose-response curves showing changes in the intracellular Ca 2+ concentration were measured for each transfectant following chemokine stimulationChemokinesK1-CCR1745-CCR1K1-CCR5745-CCR5nmMIP-1α1.581.110RANTES281.57MIP-1βNDaND, not determined.ND37.5The calculated EC50 values are shown.a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The calculated EC50 values are shown. A series of experiments was performed to determine whether heparin can directly antagonize the activity of MIP-1α. It was found that pretreatment of MIP-1α (30 nm) with heparin (250 μg/ml) resulted in 64 and 66% (mean values from at least 16 separate cells) blockade of the potential chemokine-mediated Ca2+mobilization in the CCR1- and CCR5-expressing K1-CHO transfectants, respectively (Fig. 5). Heparin alone had no effect on the intracellular concentration of Ca2+(results not shown). In view of the significant blockade of the chemokine-mediated Ca2+mobilization by heparin, the effect of heparin, heparan sulfate, and CS-A on binding of 125I-RANTES to its receptor CCR5 was also studied. Fig. 6 compares the antagonistic properties of weight-matched doses of a range of GAG molecules (50–250 μg/ml). These results indicate that CS-A had no effect on the RANTES binding to its specific receptor in both K1-CCR5 and 745-CCR5 transfectants (p > 0.07). However, both heparin and heparan sulfate produced a significant inhibition of the binding of RANTES to K1-CCR5 (Fig. 6 a) and 745-CCR5 (Fig.6 b) transfectants. Heparan sulfate also inhibited RANTES binding to K1-CCR1 cells at a concentration of 100 μg/ml (p < 0.05), while heparin was inhibitory at 50 μg/ml (p < 0.05). A study of basic fibroblast growth factor has shown that a low concentration (40 ng/ml) of free heparin can reconstitute ligand binding to GAG-deficient cells (27.Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this report, an additional series of experiments was performed to examine this possibility for chemokines. The binding of 125I-RANTES or125I-MIP-1α to K1-CCR1, K1-CCR5, 745-CCR5, or 745-CCR1 cells was examined in the presence of low concentrations of soluble heparin (20–320 ng/ml). However, there was no potentiating effect of this range of concentrations of heparin on the high affinity binding of these chemokines to their receptors on either GAG-deficient 745-CHO transfectant or the wild-type transfectants. A similar study of the Ca2+ flux induced by these chemokines in mutant CHO transfectants also failed to demonstrate a significant increase in biological activity (data not shown). To determine whether the presence of GAG molecules on the cell surface can alter the apparent affinity for ligands of CCR1 or CCR5, a series of radioligand binding assays were performed using 125I-MIP-1α,125I-RANTES, and 125I-MIP-1β. An initial experiment demonstrated that incubation of untransfected K1-CHO or 745-CHO with a high concentration (5 nm) of125I-MIP-1α resulted in approximately 3 times more binding to the wild-type cells than to a similar number of GAG-deficient mutant cells (p < 0.01). Detailed radioligand binding experiments were then performed using the full panel of transfected cell lines. Representative homologous cold-ligand competition curves for125I-MIP-1α are shown in Fig.7. In all cases, the data were consistent with a single class of receptors, but it is possible for additional low affinity sites to exist beyond the range of this assay. TheK d value for K1-CCR1 and K1-CCR5 was found to be 116 ± 26 and 196 ± 82 pm (mean ± S.D.,n = 3), whereas 745-CCR1 and 745-CC5 hadK d values of 688 ± 364 and 5090 ± 1700 pm, respectively. A further series of experiments was performed to assess the effect of GAGs on the binding affinities of RANTES and MIP-1β to these receptors (Table II). TheK d values measured for RANTES binding to CCR1 and CCR5 receptor on K1-CHO cells were not significantly different from those on 745-CCR1 and 745-CCR5 (p = 0.17 for K1-CCR1 and 745-CCR1, and p = 0.14 for K1-CCR5 and 745-CCR5) cells. MIP-1β, which is a ligand for CCR5, also did not demonstrate a significant difference in binding affinities between K1-CCR5 and 745-CCR5 cells (p > 0.09).Table IIBinding affinities for RANTES and MIP-1β to CCR1- and CCR5-transfected K1-CHO and 745-CHO cellsChemokinesK1-CCR1745-CCR1K1-CCR5745-CCR5pmMIP-1α116 ± 26688 ± 364196 ± 825090 ± 1700RANTES592 ± 10910362 ± 44322 ± 88721 ± 21MIP-1βNDaND, not determined.ND232 ± 15274 ± 55a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab These data show that GAGs increase the affinity for MIP-1α of both CCR1 and CCR5; the increase for CCR1 was 6-fold, while that for CCR5 was 26-fold (p < 0.05). In all cases, the maximal specific ligand binding was similar (data not shown), indicating that all the transfected cells expressed between 6.8 × 105and 1.2 × 106 receptors per cell. These results were consistent with the similarity between the immunofluorescence profiles (Fig. 1). This series of experiments was performed to define the role played by GAGs in a cellular response elicited by specific stimulation of the receptors CCR1 and CCR5 by their respective ligands. The system chosen for study employed CHO cells, which were shown in this investigation and others (28.Samson M. Labbe O. Mollereau C. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3362-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) to be unresponsive to stimulation by human chemokines. However, wild-type K1-CHO cells acquired the capacity to respond to MIP-1α and RANTES after transfection with CCR1 or to MIP-1α, RANTES, and MIP-1β after transfection with CCR5. This response was measured in terms of the induction of an intracellular Ca2+flux and the stimulation of cellular migration; these are properties shared by human cells such as monocytes, which show a physiological response to CC chemokines. A potential role for GAGs in the chemokine-signaling process was demonstrated clearly by inhibition of the induction of the Ca2+ flux in CHO transfectants by mixture of MIP-1α with the soluble GAG molecule, heparin. Heparin is structurally and biosynthetically related to the common cell surface GAG, heparan sulfate, and is known to bind a range of growth factors and cytokines with high affinity. The exact nature of the interaction between chemokines and heparin is unknown. However, it is unlikely that this is simply a nonspecific ionic interaction between cationic protein sequences and anionic GAGs. This is supported by the observation that 50–250-pg/ml quantities of heparin and heparan sulfate could inhibit the binding of RANTES to its receptor, while similar amounts of the anionic GAG, CS-A, did not prevent binding. Hence, the charge distribution on the GAG appears to be of critical importance for interaction with protein molecules (29.Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) In many cases, a GAG-binding motif has been identified with a consensus BBXB sequence, where B is a basic residue and Xis any other amino acid. Site-directed mutagenesis of MIP-1α has shown that three noncontiguous arginine residues are critical for GAG binding, with a further lysine residue also contributing to the affinity of this interaction (24.Koopmann W. Krangel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10103-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Significantly, two of these arginine residues and the contributing lysine form a BBXB motif. Koopmann and Krangel (24.Koopmann W. Krangel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10103-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have shown that a singly substituted MIP-1α mutant that fails to interact with heparin displays wild-type binding to CCR1 and produces wild-type Ca2+ signaling. However, a non-heparin-binding mutant of MIP-1α generated by Graham et al. (30.Graham G.J. Wilkinson P.C. Nibbs R.J. Lowe S. Kolset S.O. Parker A. Freshney M.G. Tsang M.L. Pragnell I.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6506-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) failed to bind to or signal through CCR1. To investigate further the role of cell surface proteoglycans in chemokine activity, our group has performed a series of experiments using the mutant 745-CHO cell line. These cells were produced by chemical mutagenesis with ethylmethane sulfonate followed by screening for colonies of cells showing a reduced incorporation of sulfated GAGs into cell surface proteoglycans (26.Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Detailed study revealed that the 745-CHO cell line is deficient in xylosyltransferase, which prevents coupling and, hence, initiation of GAG chain formation on serine residues of the proteoglycan core protein (31.Esko J.D. Elgavish A. Prasthofer T. Taylor W.H. Weinke J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, wild-type CHO cells express both heparan sulfate and CS-A on their surface. As a consequence, the transfection of 745-CHO mutants with human CCR1 or CCR5 receptors provides an excellent system for investigation of the role of GAG molecules in the response to MIP-1α. The normal Ca2+-flux observed following stimulation of both CCR1- and CCR5-expressing 745-CHO transfectants with a high concentration of chemokines (MIP-1α, RANTES, MIP-1β) demonstrated the absence of an absolute requirement for GAG expression for chemokine responsiveness. This observation is consistent with the potential of non-GAG-binding, mutant MIP-1α molecules to activate both monocytes and CCR1-expressing human epithelial cells (24.Koopmann W. Krangel M.S. J.

However, despite the selection of CHO transfectants expressing approximately equal numbers of receptors, at lower ligand concentrations it was found that both CCR1- and CCR5-expressing wild-type cells were more responsive than the corresponding 745-CHO transfectants. Previous studies by our group have shown that soluble, heparin-like GAGs are able to antagonize the biological activity of IFN-γ in vitro (32.Douglas M.S. Rix D.A. Dark J.H. Talbot D. Kirby J.A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 107: 578-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mixture of heparin and MCP-1 prior to incubation with mononuclear leukocytes effectively antagonized the tyrosine phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase and cellular migration produced by MCP-1 alone (33.Douglas M.S. Ali S. Rix D.A. Zhang J.G. Kirby J.A. Immunology. 1997; 92: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There is also a precedent for heparin to increase the affinity of FGF molecules for their high affinity receptors on GAG-deficient cells. However, in the current study low concentrations of heparin did not have a potentiating effect on the binding of chemokines to their receptors on GAG-deficient cells, while high concentrations of heparin-like GAGs were always inhibitory. A series of radioligand binding experiments demonstrated that both CCR1 and, to a greater degree, CCR5 showed a higher affinity for MIP-1α when expressed in wild-type CHO cells than when in the GAG-deficient mutant cells. These results are consistent with the Ca2+flux data and support the notion that expression of cell surface GAGs is not an absolute requirement for CCR1 or CCR5 ligation or signaling but does improve the sensitivity of cells to chemokine stimulation. However, when these experiments were repeated with RANTES and MIP-1β, the absence of GAGs had no significant effect on the binding affinity to their receptors CCR1 and CCR5. The data showing a decreased affinity for MIP-1α to seven-transmembrane receptors CCR1 and CCR5 in GAG-deficient cells is consistent with the results recently published by Hoogewerf et al. (34.Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S.V. Proudfoot A.E.I. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I. Power C.A. Wells T.N.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) showing a lower affinity for MIP-1α and RANTES binding to CCR1 on cells pretreated with glycosidase enzymes. In contrast, results published by Graham et al. (30.Graham G.J. Wilkinson P.C. Nibbs R.J. Lowe S. Kolset S.O. Parker A. Freshney M.G. Tsang M.L. Pragnell I.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6506-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) using a dimeric sequence variant of MIP-1α show for both wild-type and GAG-deficient CHO cells transfected with CCR1 that proteoglycan presentation is not important for interaction of MIP-1α. Furthermore, this group demonstrated that neither heparin nor heparan sulfate inhibited binding at concentrations up to 2 mg/ml. The binding affinity reported by Graham et al. was 185-fold greater than that in the current report, suggesting that wild-type MIP-1α may behave differently from the modified dimeric species. In both Ca2+ flux and chemotaxis assays, CCR1- and CCR5-expressing wild-type cells were more responsive than corresponding 745-CHO transfectants when stimulated with RANTES and MIP-1β. Paradoxically, however, there was no significant difference between the binding affinities of RANTES or MIP-1β to wild-type or 745-CHO transfectants. The mechanism by which cell surface GAGs can potentiate the sensitivity of cells expressing CCR1 or CCR5 to stimulation by MIP-1α, while soluble heparin can antagonize this chemokine, remains unclear. However, the binding of MIP-1α to the surface of untransfected GAG-expressing CHO cells was greater than to the GAG-deficient mutant cells. This finding is consistent with the decreased binding of MIP-1α to cells expressing neither CCR1 nor CCR5 following treatment with glycosidase enzymes, which remove heparan sulfate and CS-A (34.Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S.V. Proudfoot A.E.I. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I. Power C.A. Wells T.N.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). These results suggest that binding to noncognate GAG sites provide a mechanism for the sequestration of chemokines onto the cell surface. Further studies have shown that cell surface GAGs potentiate the multimerization of chemokines such as MIP-1α, although the biological relevance of this remains unclear (34.Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S.V. Proudfoot A.E.I. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I. Power C.A. Wells T.N.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Multimerization of MIP-1α can also occur in solution (24.Koopmann W. Krangel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10103-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), where it is enhanced by the presence of heparin. It is possible that inappropriate GAG binding in solution will change a chemokine's conformation, resulting in failure of the normal binding to cell surface receptors. The chemokine binding to GAGs may be important for stabilization of chemokines in the form of solid phase gradients for presentation to passing leukocytes. However, recent experiments suggest that there is even greater and more fundamental involvement of GAGs in chemokine function. In support of this idea, enzymatic removal of cell surface GAGs results in a significant reduction in apparent affinity of RANTES and MIP-1α for cell surface receptors (34.Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S.V. Proudfoot A.E.I. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I. Power C.A. Wells T.N.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate synergizes with RANTES to inhibit HIV-1 replication in monocyte (35.Wagner L. Yang O.O. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Ge Y. Kalams S.A. Walker B.D. Pasternack M.S. Luster A.D. Nature. 1998; 391: 908-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the removal of cell surface GAGs has been shown to block the inhibitory effect of RANTES on human immunodeficiency virus-1 replication in PM1 T cells (36.Oravecz T. Pall M. Wang J. Roderiquez G. Ditto M. Norcross M.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4587-4592PubMed Google Scholar) and to block intracellular signaling in PBL (37.Burns J.M. Gallo R.C. DeVico A.L. Lewis G.K. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1917-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, an IL-8 mutant that binds poorly to GAGs displays reduced activity in a neutrophil chemotaxis assay that is thought to depend on both receptor binding and solid phase immobilization, but the mutant displays normal activity in a neutrophil elastase release assay that is thought to depend only on receptor binding (38.Middleton J. Neil S. Wintle J. Clark-Lewis I. Moore H. Lam C. Auer M. Hub E. Rot A. Cell. 1997; 91: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1997; 272: 10103-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and MIP-1β (25.Koopmann W. Ediriwickrema C. Krangel M.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2120-2127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that the ability of these chemokines to bind to GAGs is not essential for functional interaction with its receptor. In summary, it has been shown that high concentrations of MIP-1α can stimulate CHO cells through human CCR1 and CCR5 and that this process is independent of the presence or absence of cell surface GAGs. However, the sensitivity of these cells to low concentrations of MIP-1α was enhanced by the presence of cell surface GAGs, which increased the effective affinity of the specific CC chemokine receptors. The sensitivity of these cells was also enhanced by the presence of cell surface GAGs when stimulated with RANTES and MIP-1β in functional biological assays, but the presence or absence of GAGs did not alter the apparent affinity for these ligands. It is possible that cell surface GAGs play an important role in vivo by sequestering chemokines onto a multiplicity of relatively low affinity sites, thereby raising the effective ligand concentration or altering the conformation of chemokines within the microenvironment of their specific receptors. Hence, it is possible that the parameters for receptor binding and cell activation by chemokines may vary according to biological assay, the receptor type, and the local type and distribution of GAGs."

To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of a new synthetic domain peptide DP4 corresponding to the Leu2442–Pro2477 region of the central domain. DP4 enhanced ryanodine binding and induced a rapid Ca2+release. The concentration for half-maximal activation by agonists was considerably reduced in the presence of DP4. These effects of DP4 are analogous to the functional modifications of the ryanodine receptor caused by MH/CCD mutations (viz. hyperactivation of the channel and hypersensitization of the channel to agonists). Replacement of Arg of DP4 with Cys, mimicking the in vivoArg2458-to-Cys2458 mutation, abolished the activating effects of DP4. An N-terminal domain peptide DP1 (El-Hayek, R., Saiki, Y., Yamamoto, T., and Ikemoto, N. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 33341–33347) shows similar activation/sensitization effects. The addition of both DP4 and DP1 produced mutual interference of their activating functions. We tentatively propose that contact between the two (N-terminal and central) domains closes the channel, whereas removal of the contact by these domain peptides or by MH/CCD mutations de-blocks the channel, resulting in hyperactivation/hyper-sensitization effects.

This signal is transmitted to the trans-membrane channel domain to activate the channel by a yet-unidentified mechanism. The RyR Ca2+ channel is also activated by a variety of types of chemical reagents and polypeptides (8.Coronado A. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 35: C1485-C1504Crossref Google Scholar, 9.Cifuentes M.E. Ronjat M. Ikemoto N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10.Valdiva H.H.

Thus, there must be intricate mechanisms, which mediate the transmission of various types of signals received at various sites of the RyR to its channel domain. However, very little information is available regarding the putative intra-molecular signal transduction mechanism. The concept that interactions among several regions of the RyR might be involved in the intra-molecular signal transduction mechanism is suggested from several pieces of evidence as follows.

An antibody raised against the N-terminal region altered the Ca2+-dependence of channel gating, and the construct containing the epitope to this antibody reacted with other regions of the RyR (27.Zorzato F.

Chemical modification, under conditions that would produce oxidation-induced channel activation in fact altered the intra-molecular cross-linking pattern (28.Aghdasi B. Zhang J. Wu Y. Reid M.B.

We have paid a particular attention to an interesting relation existing between the distribution of the mutation sites of the RyR and the altered function of the RyR in MH and CCD. Namely, most of the reported mutations are localized in either of the two restricted regions of the RyR: one, the domain including several mutation sites in the Cys35-Arg614 region (designated as N-terminal domain to facilitate discussion), and the other, the domain including the Arg2168 - Arg2458 region (designated as central domain). Furthermore, mutations at different positions of these domains produce the same type of functional modification characterized by two common features: (a) hyperactivation of the Ca2+channel and (b) an increase in the sensitivity of the RyR to agonists (26.Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 30.Endo M. Yagi S. Ishizuka T. Horiuchi F. Koga Y. Amaha K. Biomed.

Physiol. 1989; 256: C358-C367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most feasible hypothesis to account for such unique situations would be as follows. The interdomain interactions between the N-terminal domain and the central domain (defined above) may play an important role in the channel regulation mechanism. Thus, mutations in either domain produce the same type of functional abnormality, since the interdomain interaction rather than the domain property itself is the critical factor. To investigate the above hypothesis, we recently embarked on a series of studies using synthetic peptides corresponding to various regions of the N-terminal domain or the central domain described above. The strategy of such peptide probe studies is as follows. Suppose thatx-region is interacting with y-region serving as a regulatory mechanism. Then, a synthetic peptide corresponding to thex-region, i.e. peptide x, would bind to the y-region, producing interference with the in vivo x-y domain-domain interaction. If the x-yinterdomain interaction is playing a key role in channel regulation, then peptide x would produce appreciable effects on the mode of regulation of the RyR channel. Such peptide probes will not only permit us to identify the putative regulatory domains, but also permit us to characterize the mode of channel regulation. Our recent study revealed several interesting RyR-domain peptides (35.El-Hayek R. Saiki Y. Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33341-33347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For instance, synthetic peptide corresponding to a portion of the N-terminal domain, DP1 (see Table I), activated the RyR2 significantly and the RyR1 to a lesser extent. Another N-terminal domain peptide DP3 was without effect on both RyR1 and RyR2.Table IAmino acid sequence of the synthetic peptides corresponding to the selected subdomains of rabbit RyR1Domain peptideCorresponding domain of the RyR1DP1590LDKHGRNHKVLDVLCSLCVC609DP3324DTAPKRDVEGMGPPEIKYGESLCFVQHV351DP42442LIQAGKGEALRIRAILRSLVPLDDLVGIISLPLQIP2477DP4-mut2442LIQAGKGEALRIRAILCSLVPLDDLVGIISLPLQIP2477DP52149VEDTMSLLECLGQIRSLLIVQMGPQEENLMIQSIGNI2185DP62038LLAHCGIQLEGEEEEPEEETSLSSRLRSLL2067Sequence is from Ref. 45.MacLennan D.H.

One is the Leu2442–Pro2477 region of the RyR1, which contains the C-terminal region of the central domain and the putative FK506-binding protein binding segment (36.Cameron A.M. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Fung E.T. Livingston D.J. Aldape R.A. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27582-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and a peptide, DP4, corresponding to this region, was synthesized. The other is the Val2149–Ile2185 region, which contains an N-terminal region of the central domain, and a peptide, DP5, corresponding to this region, was synthesized. DP4 was found to exert the most conspicuous effect on the RyR1 among the domain peptides we have investigated so far. As shown here, DP4 produced a significant enhancement of ryanodine binding and induced a rapid Ca2+release from the SR. Furthermore, this peptide increased the sensitivity of the RyR to agonists such as peptide A (the activating II-III loop peptide) and polylysine (Ca2+ release-inducing RyR-specific ligand). Both of these effects are essentially identical to the types of functional alterations seen in MH/CCD conditions described above (viz. hyperactivation of the channel and hypersensitization of the channel to agonists). Interestingly, replacement of Arg of DP4 with Cys, in the same way as it happens in the MH/CCD mutation (i.e.Arg2458-to-Cys2458 mutation (37.Manning B.M. Quane K.A. Lynch P.J. Urwyler A. Tegazzin V. Krivosic-Horber R. Censier K. Comi G. Adnet P. Wolz W. Lunardi J. Muller C.R. McCarthy T.V. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)), abolished the activating function of DP4. These findings suggest that the Leu2442–Pro2477 region of the RyR plays a critical role in the Ca2+ channel regulation and that a single amino acid residue (Arg2458) mutation produces crucial effects on the function of this domain. Another central domain peptide DP5 produced no appreciable effect on the RyR if added alone. When added together with DP4, however, it produced a considerable suppression of the activating function of DP4. In this study, we also re-investigated two N-terminal domain peptides, DP1 and DP3, described in our recent report (35.El-Hayek R. Saiki Y. Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33341-33347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). DP1, although weaker in its ability to activate the RyR1 than DP4, produced a significant increase of the sensitivity of RyR to both peptide A and polylysine in the same way as seen with peptide DP4. Thus, both of the two peptides (DP4 and DP1), corresponding to different domains (the central and N-terminal domains, respectively), mimic MH/CCD modifications. DP3 was found to produce the same type of effects as DP5; namely, it by itself produces no appreciable effect but suppresses the function of DP4. These findings, together with other pieces of evidence shown here, suggest that the interdomain interaction specified in the above hypothesis is involved in the channel regulation mechanism, and changes in this mechanism will result in the abnormal channel regulation. Triad-enriched microsomal fractions were prepared from the rabbit back paraspinous and hind leg skeletal muscle by a method of differential centrifugation as described previously (38.Ikemoto N. Kim D.H. Antoniu B. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Microsomes from the final centrifugation were homogenized in 0.3 m sucrose, 0.15 m potassium gluconate, proteolytic enzyme inhibitors (0.1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.8 μg/ml antipain, 2.0 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), 20 mmMES, pH 6.8 to a final concentration of 20–30 mg/ml, frozen immediately in liquid N2, and stored at −78 °C. Cardiac microsomes were prepared from dog ventricular cardiac muscle as described previously (35.El-Hayek R. Saiki Y. Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33341-33347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Six domain peptides were used in this study. The amino acid sequence and the residue numbers of the corresponding sequence of thein vivo domain are shown in Table I. The number assigned to the domain peptide (DP) represents the chronological order of the synthesis. DP4, DP4-mut, DP5, and DP6 were used for the first time in this study. Other peptides (DP1, DP1–2, and DP3) were already investigated (35.El-Hayek R. Saiki Y. Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33341-33347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but DP1 and DP3 were used again with a new perspective in this study. DP1, which is the N-terminal half of DP1–2, retains the function of DP1–2 (35.El-Hayek R. Saiki Y. Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33341-33347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); hence DP1–2 was not used in this study. Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 431 A synthesizer employing Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) as the α-amino-protecting group. The peptides were cleaved and deprotected with 95% trifluoroacetic acid and purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Dog cardiac or rabbit skeletal (0.5 mg/ml) microsomes were incubated in 0.1 ml of a reaction solution containing 10 nm[3H]ryanodine (68.4 Ci/ml, NEN Life Science Products), 0.3 m KCl (unless specified in the figure legends), CaCl2 (10 μm except for [Ca2+] dependence assay), 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, for 16 h at 22 °C in the presence of various concentrations of peptides and/or modulators. Samples were filtered onto glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/A) and washed twice with 5 ml of distilled water. Filters were then placed in scintillation vials containing 10 ml of scintillation mixture Ecoscint A and counted in a Beckman LS 3801 counter. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between the binding in the absence (total binding) and in the presence (nonspecific binding) of 10 μm nonradioactive ryanodine. Assays were carried out in duplicate, and each datum point was obtained by averaging the duplicates (39.El-Hayek R. Lokuta A.J. Arevalo C. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28696-28704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal microsomes (0.4 mg/ml) were incubated in a solution containing 0.15 m potassium gluconate, 1 mm MgATP, an ATP-regenerating system, 20 mm MES, pH 6.8 (Solution A) for 5 min to load the SR moiety with Ca2+. Then one volume of Solution A was mixed with one volume of Solution B containing 0.15m potassium gluconate, 20 mm MES, pH 6.8, and various concentrations of peptides. The Ca2+ concentration in both solutions was ∼ 0.25 μm. The time course of SR Ca2+ release was monitored in a stopped flow apparatus (Bio-Logic SFM-4) using 2.5 μm fluo-3 as a Ca2+ indicator as described previously (40.El-Hayek R. Yano M. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15634-15638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ten to 15 traces (each representing 1,000 data points) of the fluo-3 signal were averaged for each experiment. Fig.1 depicts the data of ryanodine binding to the SR vesicles isolated from skeletal and cardiac muscle in the presence of different concentrations of DP4. As seen, DP4 produced significant enhancement of ryanodine binding to both RyR1 and RyR2 in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the extent of enhancement in skeletal SR (maximal enhancement: 380% control) was much larger than that in cardiac SR (240% control). The concentration for the half-maximal activation (AC50) was 28 μm for the RyR1 and 100 μm for the RyR2. DP4 induced a rapid Ca2+ release from the SR. Fig.2 depicts the time courses of Ca2+ release from skeletal muscle SR induced by various concentrations of DP4. With no added DP4, stopped-flow mixing produced negligible Ca2+ release. At low concentrations (e.g. at 2 μm), DP4 produced a slow Ca2+ release. Upon increasing the concentration of DP4 up to 100 μm, both the rate and the size of Ca2+release increased. The AC50 of the initial rate of Ca2+ release was 34.0 ± 5.7 μm, which is comparable to the AC50 of RyR1 activation in ryanodine binding experiments. These results indicate that DP4 is a potent activator of both RyR1 and RyR2 and is capable of inducing a rapid Ca2+ release from the skeletal muscle SR. Judging from the rapid induction of Ca2+ release by high concentrations of DP4, it appears that this domain peptide is readily accessible to its target domain within the RyR. The general pattern of the biphasic [Ca2+] dependence of activation in the lower [Ca2+] range (0.01–10 μm) and inhibition at higher range (10 μm–3 mm) is nearly identical in the absence and the presence of 100 μm DP4 (see Fig. 3), although the magnitude of ryanodine binding activity is considerably different as described above. However, there are few important differences. First, in the presence of DP4 there is a significant enhancement of ryanodine binding at 0.01 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 3). This suggests that there are [Ca2+]-independent and [Ca2+]-dependent components in the mechanism of activation by DP4. Second, the AC50 for the [Ca2+]-dependent activation by DP4 was 0.15 μm Ca2+, which is significantly smaller than that of control (0.4 μm). Conversely, the concentration for half-maximal inhibition (IC50) in the presence of DP4 (0.8 mm Ca2+) was significantly larger than that in its absence (0.4 mm). Thus, [Ca2+]-dependent activation/inhibition of the RyR by DP4 is characterized by three aspects: the presence of a [Ca2+]-independent component of activation, the enhanced affinity for activating Ca2+, and the reduced affinity for inhibitory Ca2+. Fig. 4 shows the [Mg2+]-dependent inhibition pattern of the ryanodine binding activity of the RyR1 in the absence and the presence of 100 μm DP4. Interestingly, there was a small but consistent difference in the IC50 for Mg2+in each experiment as well. Namely, the IC50 was shifted to the higher [Mg2+] in the presence of DP4; the IC50 calculated from the averaged data being 0.33 mm and 0.48 mm at 0 and 100 μmDP4, respectively (Fig. 4). As shown in our recent studies, peptide A (a synthetic peptide corresponding to the Thr671–Leu690region of the dihydropyridine receptor α1 subunit II-III loop) activates the RyR1 in an isoform-specific manner and induces Ca2+ release from skeletal muscle SR (41.El-Hayek R.

Biochemistry. 1995; 37: 7015-7020Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). On this basis, we proposed that this peptide mimics the voltage-dependent induction of skeletal muscle-type excitation-contraction coupling (41.El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 42.El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the experiments shown in Fig. 5, we investigated the possibility that DP4 might affect the modes of activation by this peptide. As seen, peptide A alone produced a concentration-dependent enhancement of ryanodine binding, with an AC50 of ∼20 μm. In the presence of DP4 (100 μm), peptide A produced further activation in an additive fashion. Interestingly, the [peptide A] dependence of activation showed a considerable shift to the left in the presence of DP4, resulting in an apparent AC50 of ∼5 μm. As described previously (41.El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 42.El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7825-7832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), excessively higher concentrations of peptide A becomes inhibitory, resulting in a biphasic activation/inhibition profile. The inhibitory phase was also shifted to the left in the presence of DP4. Fig. 6 shows the results of similar experiments with polylysine. Polylysine is the RyR-specific ligand that induces Ca2+ release at much lower concentrations than other release-inducing reagents such as caffeine and serves as an excellent agonist in terms of its specificity and potency (40.El-Hayek R. Yano M. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15634-15638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As seen, in the presence of DP4 the AC50 for polylysine decreased from 7 μm to 4 μm, and the inhibition by higher concentrations polylysine (9.Cifuentes M.E. Ronjat M. Ikemoto N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 42.El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1995; 37: 7015-7020Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was also shifted to the left. Thus, DP4 produced common effects on the two different types of agonists: peptide A and polylysine. Namely, (a) DP4 potentiated the peptide-induced Ca2+ release in an “additive” manner, and (b) it shifted the biphasic activation/inhibition curve to the left. These effects correspond to the changes in the activity pattern in MH/CCD conditions;i.e. (a) hyperactivation of the release channel activity and (b) the increased affinity to the release triggering reagents. As deduced from the above finding, DP4 mimics several abnormalities of the Ca2+ channel seen in MH and CCD, namely the abnormalities caused by site-specific mutations. The RyR domain corresponding to DP4 contains one Arg2458-to-Cys2458 (MH) mutation site (37.Manning B.M. Quane K.A. Lynch P.J. Urwyler A. Tegazzin V. Krivosic-Horber R. Censier K. Comi G. Adnet P. Wolz W. Lunardi J. Muller C.R. McCarthy T.V. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We made the same mutation in DP4 and synthesized a peptide DP4-mut as shown in Table I. Interestingly, this mutation completely abolished the activating effect that DP4 must have produced. Thus, as shown in Fig.7, DP4-mut produced no appreciable effects on ryanodine binding even at high concentrations equivalent to the maximally activating concentrations of DP4. Furthermore, 100 μm DP4-mut produced no appreciable effect on AC50 for peptide A activation either, the AC50value for peptide A being 12 ± 8 μm and 12 ± 10 μm at 0 μm and 100 μmDP4-mut. This indicates that the highly specific amino acid sequence is required for the regulatory function of the in situ domain and that the corresponding synthetic peptide DP4 represents this situation. As described in the Introduction, another domain peptide DP1 (the peptide corresponding to the N-terminal MH/CCD domain) activated the RyR and induced Ca2+ release in an RyR2-specific manner, as described in our recent report (35.El-Hayek R. Saiki Y. Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33341-33347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In view of the new finding that DP4 has two effects (activation and sensitization to agonists), we investigated whether this is also the case with DP1. As shown in Figs. 8 and9, 100 μm DP1 produced a small but appreciable enhancement of ryanodine binding to the RyR1 (see binding in the absence of peptide A or polylysine). In the presence of DP1, the activation/inhibition curves of peptide A (Fig. 8) and polylysine (Fig. 9) were both shifted to the left in the essentially identical manner as seen with DP4.Figure 9DP1 increases the sensitivity of the RyR to polylysine activation. [3H]Ryanodine binding assays were performed in the presence of 100 μm DP1 at various polylysine (M r ≈ 4,000) concentrations (solid line), with reference to that of polylysine alone (dotted line is the control curve shown in Fig. 6). Each datum point represents the mean ± S.D. of at least three assays carried out in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) According to our working hypothesis (see the Introduction), the interaction between the two MH/CCD domains (the N-terminal domain and the central domain) may be involved in the channel regulation mechanism. Both DP4 (central domain peptide) and DP1 (N-terminal domain peptide) produced similar effects as described above. We investigated whether the addition of both peptides produces additive effects or some other effects. Fig. 10 depicts the ryanodine binding data obtained with various concentrations of DP1 in combination with 100 μm DP4. As seen, DP1 alone produced appreciable enhancement of ryanodine binding in a concentration-dependent manner (up to 2.5-fold). DP4 alone produced about 4.5-fold enhancement (see the activation level of DP4 at 0 μm DP1). Interestingly, however, upon the addition of increasing concentrations of DP1, the level of enhancement of ryanodine binding that had been produced by DP4 decreased, and reached a plateau at the level nearly identical to the level of maximal activation by DP1 alone. This indicates that the combined effects of the two activating domain peptides are not additive, but competitive. Another unique feature seen in Fig. 10 is that the IC50 for the DP1 inhibition of DP4 (∼6 μm) is more than one order of magnitude lower than the AC50 for the activation by DP1 alone (∼100 μm), suggesting that there is a unique counteraction between these domain peptides (see “Discussion”). As described in the Introduction, we synthesized another new peptide DP5 corresponding to the N-terminal region of the central domain. As shown in Fig. 11, DP5 alone produced virtually no effect on ryanodine binding in a broad concentration range investigated. However, if added together with 100 μm DP4, which produced a nearly maximal activation of the RyR, increasing concentrations of the added DP5 produced progressive suppression of the activating function of DP4. Similarly, another N-terminal MH/CCD domain peptide, DP3, had no appreciable effect on the ryanodine binding in a wide concentration range examined, as shown in Fig. 12(cf. Ref. 35.El-Hayek R. Saiki Y. Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33341-33347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, when DP3 was combined with DP4, it inhibited the DP4 activation in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, the domain peptides so far examined fall in either of the two categories: those mimicking MH/CCD-like effects (DP4 and DP1) and those removing MH/CCD-like effects (DP5 and DP3). In the present study, we tested a control peptide DP6, which does not belong to either the N-terminal domain or the central domain (see TableI). This peptide neither mimicked MH/CCD-like effects nor removed MH/CCD-like effects (data not shown). The RyR opens its Ca2+ channel in response to various types of stimuli acting on its cytoplasmic region. Especially, the binding of the dihydropyridine receptor II-III loop to the RyR, the main physiologic stimulus in skeletal muscle-type excitation-contraction coupling (44.Rios E. Ma J. Gonzalez A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1991; 12: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), takes place presumably in a region of the RyR in the near vicinity of the transverse tubular system membrane. The important unsolved question is how the stimuli received at the cytoplasmic domains of the RyR control the opening of its channel. Our current working hypothesis to approach the above question has been deduced from the literature on the unique distribution of the mutation sites in MH-susceptible animals and in MH and CCD-susceptible human patients. As described in the Introduction, most mutations occur in either of the two domains of the RyR defined as the N-terminal domain (∼600 residue long) and the central domain (∼300 residue long). Furthermore, it appears that mutations at different positions in either domain result in the same type of functional modifications: namely, hyperactivation of the Ca2+ channel and hypersensitization to agonists (26.Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 30.Endo M. Yagi S. Ishizuka T. Horiuchi F. Koga Y. Amaha K. Biomed.

Physiol. 1989; 256: C358-C367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most feasible hypothesis to account for these unique features would be as follows. The mutual interactions between these domains play a key role in the regulation of the RyR channel; hence, mutations occurring in different positions of either domain would produce a common effect, viz. interference with the interdomain interaction. One of the most important aspects in this study is the finding that the newly synthesized peptide corresponding to the C-terminal portion of the central domain, DP4, showed two major effects on the RyR relevant to the hypothesis. First, it produced significant activation of the RyR (both RyR1 and RyR2), as shown by its high potency of enhancing ryanodine binding activity and inducing SR Ca2+ release. Second, it increased the sensitivity (i.e. the apparent affinity) of the RyR1 to the Ca2+ release-inducing peptides (peptide A and polylysine and activating Ca2+), as shown by the appreciable left-shift of the concentration dependence of activation. Interestingly, these two effects of DP4 correspond to the two major functional modifications of the RyR seen in MH/CCD,viz. hyperactivation of the Ca2+ channel and hypersensitization of the RyR to various agonists. This suggests that DP4 is mimicking a causative mechanism of the MH/CCD conditions. According to the principle of our peptide probe approach (see the Introduction), this would indicate that the in vivo domain, with the same structure as that of DP4 (i.e. domain 4, a part of the central domain), is involved in the interdomain interactions. We propose the following mechanism to account for the observed effects of DP4. The added DP4 will presumably compete with domain 4 for the binding to their common binding site(s) (i.e. the domain 4 counter domain). This will interfere with the interaction between domain 4 and its counter domain; in turn, the contact between these domains will be loosened. Since the outcome of such interference was activation of the channel as seen here, the tight interaction between these domains must have contributed to the channel closing. In the case of MH and CCD, the Arg2458-to-Cys2458 mutation that has taken place in domain 4 will also interfere with the interdomain interaction, resulting in the hyperactivation of the channel. The most important evidence supporting the above mechanism is the present finding that the same Arg-to-Cys mutation made in DP4 completely abolished both hyperactivation and hypersensitization effects that must have been produced by DP4. This would indicate that this specific mutation resulted in the loss of the ability of the peptide to bind to the counter domain, in turn resulting in the loss of the ability to interfere with the interdomain interaction. This is in accord with the above concept that the Arg2458-to-Cys2458 mutation in domain 4 reduces the ability to bind to its counter domain. The result also indicates that the observed activation of the RyR by DP4 requires a very specific amino acid sequence. In the context of this discussion, it should be noted that another domain peptide DP1, which corresponds to a part of the N-terminal domain, also produces hyperactivation and hypersensitization effects similar to those of DP4. Again, this would indicate that domain 1 is also involved in the interdomain interaction and the added DP1 competes with domain 1 for the binding to their common counter domain. In light of the interdomain interaction concept, it would be interesting to speculate that the domain 4 of the central domain interacts with the N-terminal domain; conversely, the domain 1 interacts with the central domain. Additional evidence for this hypothesis has been revealed in the present study. First, the addition of both activating domain peptides DP4 and DP1 together produced a much lower level of activation than the level achieved by DP4 alone. As a matter of fact, higher concentrations of DP1 almost completely reversed the activation by DP4. This is consistent with the view that the two peptides are competing to the common “de-blocking” mechanism mediated by the interdomain interaction (see above) but is inconsistent with the view that both peptides bind to activating sites. Second, the IC50 for the DP1 block of DP4 was much lower than the AC50 for DP1 activation, suggesting that the competition between the two domain peptides is highly cooperative. Putting the above pieces of evidence altogether, we tentatively propose the following mechanism. In the normally operating RyR, contact between the N-terminal domain and the central domain would correspond to an Off position of a regulator switch of the channel. In MH/CCD conditions, this putative blocking mechanism is altered (i.e. loosening of the interdomain contact) by the mutations in either of these domains, resulting in the apparent activation and hypersensitization that actually represents a de-blocking phenomenon. The exogenously added domain peptides will bind to their designated interaction sites and interfere with the interdomain contact, resulting in functional alterations similar to those in MH/CCD. This mechanism accounts for the fact that the competition between the two domain peptides is highly cooperative, since loosening of the interdomain contact by one peptide would facilitate further loosening by the other peptide. The sensitization of the RyR to Ca2+ release-inducing peptides by DP4 shown here suggests an interesting new concept as follows. The interdomain interaction postulated here might be used as a device for the intramolecular signal transduction mechanism mentioned above. For example, binding of the activating II-III loop peptide (peptide A) or the in vivo II-III loop to the RyR would remove the interdomain contact, changing the regulator switch from the Off position (see above) to the On position. Thus, the presence of DP4 or DP1, which removes the interdomain contact and, hence, catalyzes the Off-to-On action, would facilitate the peptide A-induced signal transduction process and would increase the apparent affinity for peptide A as seen in this study. Another important piece of information obtained in the present study is that one of the new central domain peptides investigated here, namely DP5, by itself produced no appreciable effect, but if added together with DP4, it produced almost complete suppression of the DP4 activation. Similarly, an N-terminal domain peptide DP3 (35.El-Hayek R. Saiki Y. Yamamoto T. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33341-33347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) also produced almost complete suppression of the DP4 activation. Thus, it appears that at least four subdomains represented by these peptides (DP4, DP1, DP5, and DP3) are involved in the postulated interdomain interaction. In conclusion, the data shown here are consistent with the following model. The mode of interaction between the two MH/CCD domains (defined as N-terminal domain and central domain) controls the functional state of the RyR Ca2+ channel: the interdomain contact produces the blocked state of Ca2+ channel, and the removal of such contact produces the activated state. Synthetic peptides DP4 and DP1 corresponding to two of such domains produced both activation of the channel and hypersensitization to agonists, mimicking the functional alterations produced by MH/CCD mutations occurring in these domains. According to the above model, these are produced by de-blocking caused by the interference of the interdomain interaction by domain peptides or mutations. We thank Dr. Renne C. Lu, Dr. Paul Leavis, Gina Pagani, and Elizabeth Gowell for their help in the synthesis and purification of the peptides."

The mammalian Kv gene family that encodes these channels is comprised of more than 30 genes that produce subunits that differ in gating and permeation properties, subcellular distribution, and regulation of expression (1.Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 2.Levitan E.S. Takimoto K. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 37: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, certain Kv channels require auxiliary subunits to be efficiently expressed on the cell surface, while many members of this family express well as homotetrameric complexes (3.Shi G.

The importance of efficient trafficking to the plasma membrane has been recently revealed by the finding that genetic diseases can be caused by mutations that alter processing and cell surface expression of voltage-gated K+ channels (4.Zhou Z.

However, despite intense structure function analysis and studies of subunit multimerization and processing (6.Deal K.K. Lovinger D.M. Tamkun M.M. J.

Recent studies suggest that C-terminal sequences are significant for expression of functional voltage-gated K+ channels. Human genetic diseases such as juvenile epilepsy, Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome, Romano-Ward syndrome, and episodic ataxia are associated with loss of large stretches of the native C-terminal region of KCNQ2, KvLQT1, HERG, and Kv1.1, respectively (9.Biervert C.

In the case of HERG, it is known that a 104-amino acid C-terminal sequence is critical for production of functional channels (13.Kupershmidt S. Snyders D.J. Raes A. Roden D.M. J. Biol.

Here we identify a new 3-amino acid motif located in a highly variable C-terminal region of Kv1 subunits that influences cell surface expression. Loss of the motif disrupts plasma membrane localization and glycosylation. Variations in this motif found in wild type Kv1 family members cause differences in basal and Kvβ-dependent cell surface expression. Thus, this new motif is a major determinant of Kv channel processing and cell surface expression.

GFP-Kv1.5 cDNA was made by subcloningBglII-3′end HindIII fragment of rat Kv1.5 cDNA (Kv1 pGEMA, nucleotides 299–2431) (16.Swanson R. Marshall J. Smith J.S. Williams J.B. Boyle M.B. Folander K.

The reading frame was shifted by digestion withBglII and filling-in with Klenow. The resulting fusion protein lacks the first two amino acids (ME) of rat Kv1.5 polypeptide and contains SGLRS in the border between EGFP and Kv1.5. GFP-Kv1.2 was constructed using polymerase chain reaction with primer containing the 5′ end of the rat Kv1.2 cDNA (17.McKinnon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8230-8236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a BglII site. The resultant fusion protein consists of EGFP, the linker sequence SGLRS, and all of the Kv1.2 coding sequence. Deletion, interchange, and mutation constructs were prepared from GFP-Kv1.4, GFP-Kv1.5, or GFP-Kv1.2 using endogenous restriction enzyme sites and/or by polymerase chain reaction-based methods. All the obtained constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. HEK 293 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After trypsinization, they were plated on polylysine-coated glass coverslips in a 35-mm plastic dish at ∼10% confluency for confocal microscopy and patch clamp recording. One day after passage, cells were transfected with a total of 2.0 μg of DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Transfinity, Life Technologies, Inc.). For low temperature growth conditions, the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without bicarbonate was supplemented with 25 mm hemisodium Hepes (pH 7.5), and cells were grown at 26 °C in air. GFP-tagged channel proteins were imaged using a 2001 scanning laser confocal microscope (Molecular Dynamics) using 488 nm illumination (15.Burke N.A. Takimoto K. Li D. Han W. Watkins S.C. Levitan E.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,18.Levitan E.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). GFP-positive cells that displayed a clear ring of fluorescence on an equatorial optical section that corresponded with the location of the cell surface as viewed by standard light microscopy were scored positive for cell surface expression. The number of such positive cells out of the total counted (∼100 cells) in at least two independent experiments yielded the reported percentage of cells with cell surface expression. Similar morphological measurements have been shown to correlate with biochemical and electrical determinations of cell surface expression of Kv channels (3.Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J.

Voltage-gated K+ currents in fluorescent cells were measured by the standard whole cell patch clamp method 2 days after transfection. The bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm NaHepes (pH 7.5). The pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1 mm Na3EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KHepes (pH 7.2). A holding potential of −60 mV was used, and recordings were performed at room temperature. Cells were grown in 100-mm plastic tissue culture dishes and transfected with a total of 20 μg of DNA. Two days later, the cells were washed and collected with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2 mm EDTA and then lysed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm iodoacetamide, and 0.1 mm phenylmethyl sulfoxide (Buffer A) (19.Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20.Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14149-14156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A total membrane fraction was obtained by centrifugation of the cell lysate at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The pelleted material was then suspended in a small volume of Buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 and sonicated for 10 s. Solubilized material was obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. Protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay solution with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Each sample (20 μg of protein) was separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was coated with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 2 h. The coated membrane was probed with polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Watertown, MA) at 1:2000 to 1:3000 dilution in the coating solution for overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed four times with Tween-containing phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with secondary peroxide-conjugated antibody, and washed four times with the same washing solution. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (NEN Life Science Products). For glycosidase treatment, the total membrane fraction was resuspended in Buffer A containing 0.25 m sucrose with a Dounce homogenizer. A nuclei-free membrane fraction was then obtained by differential centrifugation as described previously (20.Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14149-14156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The pelleted membrane was suspended in a small volume of solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and 1% SDS and boiled for 2 min, followed by 10-fold dilution with solution containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.2), 50 mm EDTA, 10 mmNaN3, and 0.5% Triton X-100. An aliquot of the diluted sample was incubated with or without endoglycosidase F for 2–3 h at 37 °C. Digested samples were then subjected to immunoblot analysis, following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To test for coassembly between deletion mutants and wild type Kv1.4 proteins, cells were transfected with Kv1.4 cDNA and GFP-tagged Kv1.4 or Kv1.5 cDNA. Membrane extracts were prepared 3 days after transfection using 1% Triton as described above. Extracts were precleared with protein A-containing fixed bacteria (Pansorbin, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and mixed with anti-GFP antibody (Medical and Biological Laboratories) and Pansorbin overnight at 4 °C. The complexes were precipitated and washed with Buffer A four times. Bound materials were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Confocal microscopy and patch clamping demonstrate that GFP-tagged Kv1.4 channel protein targets efficiently to the cell surface to form functional voltage-gated K+ channels. Furthermore, deleting the final 15 C-terminal amino acids does not interfere with this localization (15.Burke N.A. Takimoto K. Li D. Han W. Watkins S.C. Levitan E.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, a 40-amino acid C-terminal deletion (Kv1.4ΔC40) disrupts cell surface localization measured by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1 A, top panels). This inefficient targeting is accompanied by a reduction in voltage-gated channel activity to levels only slightly above controls (Fig. 1 B). Further increasing the level of subunit protein expression results in accumulation in large round structures inside the cell (Fig. 1 A, bottom panels). Under these conditions, the 40-amino acid C-terminal deletion reduces the fraction of cells with obvious surface expression (i.e. like Fig. 1 A, left panels) from 100 to 6% (TableI). Kvβ subunits prevent the formation of the large intracellular structures but do not rescue efficient cell surface localization of the Kv1.4ΔC40 mutant. Rather, expression of either Kvβ1 or Kvβ2 auxiliary subunits induces a perinuclear localization of the pore forming subunits within the cell (Fig.1 C, compare with Fig. 1 A, bottom panels). Likewise, maintaining cells at 26 °C fails to produce normal channel localization (data not shown). Thus, a C-terminal sequence is required for efficient cell surface localization of Kv1.4 channels.Table IEffects of C-terminal deletions and mutations on cell surface expression of Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 proteinsConstructsSequencesCell surface%Kv1.4 deletion constructs Wild typeLEMEEGVKESLCGKEEKCQGKGDDSETDKNNCSNAKAVETDV100 ΔC15LEMEEGVKESLCGKEEKCQGKGDDS94 ΔC26LEMEEGVKESLCGKEEK93 ΔC31LEMEEGVKESL94 ΔC37LEMEE7 ΔC40LE6 ΔM9LE——— CGKEEKCQGKGDDSETDKNNCSNAKAVETDV8Kv1.5 deletion constructs Wild typeLESSDSIRRGSCPLEKCHLKAKSNVILRRSLYALCLDTSRETDL89 ΔC10LESSDSIRRGSCPLEKCHLKAKSNVILRRSLYAL86 ΔC13LESSDSIRRGSCPLEKCHLKAKSNVILRRSL83 ΔC18LESSDSIRRGSCPLEKCHLKAKSNVI7 ΔC28LESSDSIRRGSCPLEK6Kv1.4-Kv1.5 interchange constructs 1.4ΔC37+1.5SLLEMEELRRSL71 1.5ΔC28+1.4SLLESSDSIRRGSCPLEKGVKESL97Kv1.4 mutation constructs ΔC31RL6LEMEELSEKVG12 ΔC31S622ALEMEEGVKEAL43 ΔC31L623ALEMEEGVKESA30 ΔC31NCLEMEEGVQQSL95 ΔC31V619ALEMEEGAKESL72 ΔC31VSL/AAALEMEEGAKEAA6Various deletions (Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 deletion constructs), interchanges (Kv1.4-Kv1.5 interchange constructs), and point mutations (Kv1.4 mutation constructs) were generated from GFP-Kv1.4 and GFP-Kv1.5 and individually transfected into HEK 293 cells. 1 μg of expression plasmid was used in each case. Underlines show amino acids that are altered from the original channel polypeptide. Three days after transfection, confocal microscopy was used to test subcellular location of fusion proteins.

Open table in a new tab Various deletions (Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 deletion constructs), interchanges (Kv1.4-Kv1.5 interchange constructs), and point mutations (Kv1.4 mutation constructs) were generated from GFP-Kv1.4 and GFP-Kv1.5 and individually transfected into HEK 293 cells. 1 μg of expression plasmid was used in each case. Underlines show amino acids that are altered from the original channel polypeptide. Three days after transfection, confocal microscopy was used to test subcellular location of fusion proteins. More than 70 transfected (i.e.GFP-positive) cells for each construct were examined for plasma membrane fluorescence. The percentage of cells with clear cell surface localization (i.e. like in Fig. 1 A, left panels) is given in the right column. Deletions of varying lengths were generated to identify the essential portion of the C-terminal region. Because the region identified initially is not conserved among Kv1 channels, a similar deletion analysis was performed with Kv1.5, a channel that has slightly less robust cell surface targeting than Kv1.4 (Table I). Previously, we used biotinylation of extracellular sugar groups to quantitate cell surface expression of Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 subunits (20.Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14149-14156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, because glycosylation is affected by the loss of a C-terminal sequence (see below), we used confocal microscopy to determine the percentage of cells with an obvious ring of cell surface-proximal fluorescence. Measurements of deletion mutants led to the identification of 6-amino acid regions that are required for efficient cell surface expression located 32 and 14 amino acids from the C termini of Kv1.4 and Kv1.5, respectively. Specifically, the identified sequence in Kv1.4 is GVKESL and in Kv1.5 is DLRRSL. Downstream sequences are not required for avid cell surface expression. Nor do such sequences rescue the effect of deleting the important regions. Importantly, the essential sequence from one subunit complements deletion of the analogous sequence in the other subunit. In fact, the Kv1.4 sequence was more efficient than the native Kv1.5 sequence in rescuing cell surface localization of a Kv1.5ΔC construct. Furthermore, the Kv1.5 sequence was less efficient than the native Kv1.4 sequence in targeting a Kv1.4ΔC construct (Table I). Thus, it appears that variations in the identified sequences can account for the difference in localization between these two members of the Kv1 family. We then used site-directed mutagenesis to identify important amino acids in this region (Table I). Inverting the identified Kv1.4 6 amino acid sequence disrupted cell surface localization. Thus, amino acid composition alone is not sufficient. The sequences identified in Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 both end with SL. Replacing either of these amino acids with an alanine reduced cell surface localization more than 2-fold. Each of the SL sequences is flanked by two upstream charged amino acids. Yet replacing the KE with QQ does not affect Kv1.4 distribution. The next upstream position contains an aliphatic amino acid (Val for Kv1.4 and Leu for Kv1.5). Replacing this residue with alanine had a moderate effect. Finally, we found that replacing the Kv1.4 sequence GVKESL with GAKEAA dramatically reduced cell surface localization. Therefore, it is evident that the VXXSL motif ensures robust expression of Kv1.4 channels at the plasma membrane. We then set out to test whether differences in the essential motif could account for the great variations in cell surface targeting among wild type Kv1 family members. Although Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 homomeric channels display robust plasma membrane expression in the absence of auxiliary subunits, Kv1.2 requires Kvβ subunits for optimal targeting (3.Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment reveals that VXXSL motif of Kv1.4 is replaced with VXXSN in Kv1.2 (Fig.2 A). To test whether this difference is significant, a Kv1.4L623N mutant was generated. As can be seen in Fig. 2 B (top panels), this mutation reduces the efficiency of cell surface targeting. Furthermore, plasma membrane localization of this mutant is rescued upon coexpression with Kvβ1 subunits (Fig. 2 B, bottom panels). Thus, the Leu to Asn switch induces Kv1.4 to behave more like Kv1.2; expression is suboptimal unless Kvβ subunits are present. The effect of the complementary substitution in GFP-tagged Kv1.2 (i.e. Kv1.2N469L) was also examined (Fig.3). Consistent with our Kv1.4 experiments, this change stimulated cell surface channel expression as much as coexpression with Kvβ subunits (i.e. each manipulation produced a 1.4-fold increase). If the VXXSL motif and Kvβ act on the same step in channel processing and expression, then the effects of auxiliary subunits and the N469L mutation should not be additive. However, the increases in cell surface expression by these manipulations were found to combine to produce a 2-fold increase (Fig. 3). Hence, the enhancement of cell surface targeting by Kvβ subunits is independent of the action of the C-terminal motif. Biochemical experiments were then performed to gain insight into how C-terminal VXXSL sequence governs cell surface expression of functional channels. Immunoblots revealed that the Kv1.4ΔC40 mutant protein is expressed at higher levels than the wild type subunit 1–6 days after transient transfection (Fig.4, A and B). Furthermore, a high molecular weight species seen with wild type Kv1.4 subunits is not as abundant with the C-terminal deletion mutant. Treatment of GFP-tagged Kv1.4 or wild type Kv1.4 (data not shown) proteins with endoglycosidase F collapses the two native bands on the blot into a single lower molecular weight band (Fig. 4 B,left lanes). This suggests that the higher band represents fully glycosylated protein, whereas the lower band is only core glycosylated. Endoglycosidase F produces a similar effect on the GFP-tagged Kv1.4ΔC40 bands (Fig. 4 B, right lanes). Therefore, the lower abundance of the high molecular weight band found after deletion of the VXXSL motif is indicative of less extensive glycosylation. Importantly, it has been shown that this glycosylation is not required for expression of functional channels (6.Deal K.K. Lovinger D.M. Tamkun M.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1666-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, the absence of glycosylation cannot account for the abnormal distribution of the Kv1.4ΔC40 protein. Rather, these findings argue that loss of a C-terminal sequence does not induce degradation but does alter processing of the channel subunit as well as localization to the plasma membrane. The poor glycosylation of the ΔC mutants might be caused by inhibition of the rapid, cotranslational multimerization of Kv1 subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum. To test whether the C-terminal motif disrupts processing by interfering with multimerization, C-terminal deletion constructs were coexpressed with wild type subunits and then immunoprecipitated. As can be seen in the top panelof Fig. 4 C, coexpression with ΔC mutants promotes the appearance of the less glycosylated species of the wild type Kv1.4. Furthermore, the lower panel of Fig. 4 C shows that wild type Kv1.4 subunits immunoprecipitate equally well with full length or truncated GFP-tagged Kv1 subunits. Hence, the poor glycosylation of wild type subunits was likely caused by their association with the ΔC mutant subunits. This implies that the VXXSL motif must be important for a step following multimerization but preceding full glycosylation. This report identifies a new motif that governs processing and cell surface expression of voltage-gated K+ channels. Because the location of this sequence in the channel polypeptide is not rigid, it was not evident from previous sequence alignments. Furthermore, a role for this region of K+ channels was not suspected because it is not located in domains implicated in gating, ion permeation, multimerization, or channel clustering and immobilization. Yet variations in the VXXSL motif contribute to the differences in the expression and activity of wild type Kv channels. For example, our data indicate that the C-terminal motifs found in Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 account for the different efficiencies in cell surface expression of these two subunits. Furthermore, complementary mutagenesis experiments with Kv1.2 and Kv1.4 indicate that the stimulation of Kv1.2 subunit expression by auxiliary Kvβ subunits is marked because of the presence of a suboptimal VXXSN sequence. Therefore, much of the diversity in expression of normal Kv1 channels can be explained by variations in the VXXSL motif. We also report that deletion of this sequence disrupts Kv channel activity apparently by preventing trafficking to the cell surface. This result might appear surprising in light of current recordings from truncated Kv1.5 channels expressed in L cells (21.Uebele V.N. Yeola S.W. Snyders D.J. Tamkun M.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). On one hand, this difference might reflect cell type specific differences. For example, it is known that L cells express auxiliary Kvβ subunits, whereas HEK 293 cells do not (22.Uebele V.N. England S.K. Chaudhary A. Tamkun M.M. Snyders D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2406-2412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, we have found that channel activity appears to saturate before cell surface expression and that transfection of expression vectors for the truncated channel at supersaturated levels can yield significant currents. 2E. S. Levitan and D. Li, unpublished data. This argues that very inefficient targeting can yield considerable currents with overexpression. Because the fraction of channel protein that reaches the cell surface in L cells has not been measured, the efficiency of surface expression in that system is not known. Thus, further work will be required to determine whether there is any contradiction between previous electrophysiological experiments in L cells and our conclusions regarding the requirement for the VXXSL motif for efficient surface channel expression. It is also interesting to note that loss of a significant portion of the C termini of KvLQT1, HERG, KCNQ2, and Kv1.1 causes Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome, Romano-Ward syndrome, juvenile epilepsy, and episodic ataxia in humans, respectively (9.Biervert C.

Neurology. 1999; 52 (Suppl. 2) (abstr.): 553Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that loss of VXXSL-like motifs may contribute to disease phenotypes in human channelopathies. Indeed, preliminary experiments suggest that a region containing such a sequence may be required for functional expression of KvLQT1 channels. 3E. K. Yang, D. Li, K. Takimoto, and E. S. Levitan, unpublished data. These findings suggest that the VXXSL motif may be important in distantly related Kv channels. Our experiments raise the issue of how the C-terminal motif governs channel cell surface localization. Because glycosylation is less extensive after deleting the motif, it is possible that the subunits traffic inefficiently to or through the Golgi. This might occur because the C-terminal motif is required after early multimerization to exit the endoplasmic reticulum. This would be expected if the channel protein is misfolded. In favor of this interpretation, we found that large aggresome-like structures are formed after overexpression of the ΔC mutants (compare Fig.1 A, bottom panels, with Ref. 23.Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). However, it is intriguing that Kvβ subunits, which are known to act as chaperones for Kv channels (3.Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), prevent the formation of aggresome-like structures without rescuing efficient channel localization. Because subunit tetramerization may occur in two dimerization steps (8.Tu L. Deutsch C. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2004-2017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), it is also possible that the VXXSL motif is important for the second association step. If this were the case, subunits would be trapped in an intermediate state. Finally, our data are also consistent with the hypothesis that the VXXSL sequence is an anterograde targeting sequence recognized by cellular targeting or sorting machinery. A different C-terminal anterograde signal has been proposed to be present in SUR auxiliary subunits of KATP channels (24.Sharma N. Crane A. Clement J.P., IV Gonzalez G. Babenko A.P. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20628-20632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Most importantly, whatever the action of this C-terminal motif is, the results presented here indicate that it is a major determinant of surface channel expression. Thus, this C-terminal sequence may serve as a useful target for therapeutic drugs to alter expression of voltage-gated K+ channels without affecting gating or permeation. We thank N. A. Burke, W.

In this study, we examined whether Bcl-2 is phosphorylated by CDC2 kinase, a master regulator of G2/M transition in the eukaryotic cell cycle. When CDC2 was activated by okadaic acid in HL-60 cells, Bcl-2 phosphorylation was readily induced. The phosphorylation was correlated with the accumulation of cells in G2/M phases, but was not proportional to the level of apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that Bcl-2 was phosphorylated during G2/M phases of normal cell cycle. The ability of CDC2 to phosphorylate Bcl-2 was confirmed byin vitro kinase assay with a highly purified CDC2-cyclin B complex. Using synthetic peptides and mutant cell lines, we identified threonine 56, one of two consensus sites for CDC2 within the Bcl-2 sequence, as a residue phosphorylated by CDC2. Mutation at threonine 56 abrogated the cell cycle inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 without affecting anti-apoptotic function. These results suggest that two distinct functions of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptosis and cell cycle inhibition) are differentially regulated by post-translational mechanisms such as phosphorylation.

CDC2-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2 may play some physiological roles in the negative regulatory events during mitosis. Bcl-2 is a 26-kDa integral membrane protein, which is located on the cytoplasmic aspect of the mitochondrial outer membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear envelope (1.Newton K. Strasser A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It represents a family of proteins regulating apoptosis in either a positive or negative manner. The Bcl-2 family is divided into two subgroups: one with an anti-apoptotic property (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL Bcl-w) and the other with apoptosis inducing ability (Bax, Bak, Bok, Bad, Bik, and Bid) (2.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that Bcl-2 can inhibit apoptosis in a variety of cell types (3.Terui Y. Furukawa Y.

In addition to the anti-apoptotic effect, another important function of Bcl-2 was recently unveiled; it restrains cell cycle entry of quiescent cells (5.Linette G.P. Li Y. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J.

O'Reilly L.A. Strasser A. Cory S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4628-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Despite these investigations, however, the molecular basis of the cell cycle inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 is still unclear. Although recent studies have established that Bcl-2 function is primarily modulated by heterodimerization with pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (2.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar), there may be other regulatory mechanisms such as phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 was first demonstrated by Alnemri et al. (11.Alnemri E.S. Robertson N.M. Fernandes T.F. Croce C.M. Litwack G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7295-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) in Sf9 cells which ectopically express Bcl-2 with a baculovirus expression system. Since then, there are several reports dealing with Bcl-2 phosphorylation, but its functional significance remains controversial (12.Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Some researchers reported that anticancer drug-induced apoptosis was accompanied by Bcl-2 phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylation inactivates Bcl-2 function (12.Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 13.Haldar S. Chintapalli J. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1253-1255PubMed Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon was observed in Ras-induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells (14.Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). By contrast, other groups demonstrated that Bcl-2 phosphorylation is essential for anti-apoptotic activity of bryostatin-1, an activator of protein kinase C, or cytokines such as interleukin-3 and erythropoietin (15.Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 16.May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A.

In any case, Bcl-2 phosphorylation could serve as a pivotal mechanism for integrating extracellular signals and apoptotic pathways. Therefore, establishing the molecular identity of protein kinases executing Bcl-2 phosphorylation is of paramount importance to our understanding of apoptosis and other cellular events regulated by Bcl-2. In the present study, with this background in mind, we examined the possibility of Bcl-2 phosphorylation by CDC2 kinase, a master regulator of G2/M transition in eukaryotic cells (17.Lowe M.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28469-28477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We found that CDC2 phosphorylates Bcl-2 protein at threonine 56 during G2/M phases of the cell cycle, and modulates the cell cycle-regulatory function of Bcl-2 without affecting the anti-apoptotic property. Okadaic acid (provided by Dr. Hirota Fujiki, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 100 μg/ml and stored at −20 °C until use. Butyrolactone I, a specific inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases including CDC2, was prepared and used as described previously (20.Furukawa Y. Iwase S. Terui Y. Kikuchi J. Sakai T. Nakamura M. Kitagawa S. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28469-28477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Nocodazole was obtained from Janssen Biotech N. V. (Olen, Belgium). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Peptides were ordered from Asahi Emers Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Separation of cells enriched for each phase of the cell cycle was conducted with counterflow centrifugal elutriation using the SRR6Y system (Hitachi Koki Co., Tokyo, Japan) (21.Terui Y. Furukawa Y. Kikuchi J. Saito M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing HL-60 cells were separated into 6 fractions, followed by flow cytometric analysis to monitor the status of separation. The cells were synchronized in M phase by nocodazole as described previously (22.Schievella A.R. Paige L.A. Johnson K.A. Hill D.E. Erikson R.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 239-246PubMed Google Scholar). An HL-60 subline which overexpresses wild-type Bcl-2 protein was established by transfection of cytomegalovirus promoter-driven Bcl-2 expression plasmid (pcDNA3-bcl-2) into HL-60 cells as reported (3.Terui Y. Furukawa Y. Sakoe K. Ohta M. Saito M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Substitution of threonine 56 and serine 87 to alanine was carried out with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, denatured pcDNA3-bcl-2 plasmid was annealed with the following mutant oligonucleotides at 55 °C (mutated sites are indicated in boldface italics): for the threonine 56 mutation: 5′-CCCAGCCCGGGC A CGCGCCCCATCCAGCCG-3′ (sense), 5′-CGGCTGGATGGGGCGCG T GCCCGGGCTGGG-3′ (antisense). For the serine 87 mutation: 5′-GCGGGGCCTGCGCTC GC CCCGGTGCCACCTG-3′ (sense), 5′-CAGGTGGCACCGGG GC GAGCGCAGGCCCCGC-3′ (antisense). Then, the plasmid DNA was subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification with Pfu DNA polymerase, followed by DpnI digestion to eliminate parental DNA template with wild-type sequence. The remaining mutated plasmid was amplified in Escherichia coli, purified by ultracentrifugation, and used for transfection into HL-60 cells to generate mutant Bcl-2-overexpressing sublines. The cell cycle profile was analyzed by staining intracellular DNA with propidium iodide in preparation for a flow cytometry with the FACScan/CellFIT system (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). DNA histogram was obtained by analyzing 25,000 cells with the ModFIT program (Becton-Dickinson). The proportion of apoptotic cells was simultaneously calculated by this method (20.Furukawa Y. Iwase S. Terui Y. Kikuchi J. Sakai T. Nakamura M. Kitagawa S. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28469-28477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice-cold TBS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), and lysed in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate) in the presence of protease inhibitors. Whole cell lysates (25 μg each) were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (0.1 × 6.5 × 8.5 cm) and transferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After blocking, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with the following antibodies at a final concentration of 300 ng/ml (except at 1:1000 dilution for anti-Bcl-2): anti-Bcl-2 polyclonal antibody (14371E, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), anti-Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (clone 7, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-CDC2 monoclonal antibody (clone 17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-cyclin B monoclonal antibody (GNS1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RB protein (pRB) monoclonal antibody (G3–245, Pharmingen), and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Ab-1, Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY). The membranes were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after incubating with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:8000 in 0.01 × blocking buffer for 1 h. Whole cell lysates (300 μg) were incubated with 5 μl of either anti-Bcl-2 antibody (14371E) or preimmune rabbit serum in 300 μl of IP buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate) at 4 °C for 1 h. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads, washed three times in 0.5 × IP buffer, and resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, and 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of a highly purified recombinant CDC2-cyclin B complex (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). After incubating for 30 min at 30 °C, the samples were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and autoradiography. Histone H1 kinase assay was carried out as described previously (23.Ishida Y. Furukawa Y. DeCaprio J.A. Saito M. Griffin J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). High performance liquid chromatography-purified synthetic peptides (2 mm) were incubated at 30 °C in 30 μl of a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 30 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (200 μCi/ml) for 30 min. Then, each sample was spotted onto a phosphocellulose paper disc, washed twice with 1% acetic acid, and washed three times in distilled water. The radioactivity on each disc was determined by scintillation counting. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma), adjusted to a concentration of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml, and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h after adding [32P]orthophosphoric acid at 1 mCi/ml. The cells in G0/G1 and G2/M phases were separated by centrifugal elutriation and lysed in EBC buffer. Bcl-2 protein was immunoprecipitated as described above, and its phosphorylation state was analyzed by autoradiography. Okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of phosphatase 2A, is known to activate CDC2 kinase by inducing phosphorylation of CDC25 (24.Yamashita K. Yasuda H. Pines J. Yasumoto K. Nishitani H. Ohtsubo M. Hunter T. Sugimura T. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4331-4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar,25.Rime H. Jessus C. Ozon R. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that CDC2 is involved in phosphorylation of Bcl-2, we cultured HL-60 cells with 500 nm okadaic acid, a dose sufficient for CDC2 activation, and examined the expression and phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by immunoblotting. First, we confirmed that CDC2 was really activated by okadaic acid in our system. In proliferating HL-60 cells, CDC2 protein was discernible as 3 bands of different mobilities on SDS-polyacrylamide gels: the fastest migrating band corresponds to dephosphorylated, active CDC2; and the other two slower migrating bands represent inactive CDC2 in which tyrosine 14 and threonine 15 are phosphorylated (26.Solomon M.J. Lee T. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) (Fig.1, second row). After 4 h of treatment with okadaic acid, the phosphorylated CDC2 species completely disappeared and only the active form remained. This change was accompanied by an increase in histone H1 kinase activity (data not shown). Coincident with the activation of CDC2, a slowly migrating form of Bcl-2 appeared (Fig. 1, uppermost panel). This form was previously shown to be the phosphorylated Bcl-2 species by32P labeling experiments and phosphatase treatment (11.Alnemri E.S. Robertson N.M. Fernandes T.F. Croce C.M. Litwack G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7295-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar,12.Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Neither CDC2 activation nor mobility shift of Bcl-2 was observed in HL-60 cells cultured with dimethyl sulfoxide (carrier) alone. These results suggest that CDC2 is involved in phosphorylation of Bcl-2 protein. To convincingly demonstrate that Bcl-2 is phosphorylated by CDC2, we carried out in vitro kinase assays using a highly purified CDC2-cyclin B complex. This complex efficiently phosphorylated histone H1, a specific substrate of CDC2 (27.Moreno S. Nurse P. Cell. 1990; 61: 549-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), in a dose-dependent manner, confirming that its activity is maintained in vitro (Fig.2 A). Then, we examined whether this complex could phosphorylate Bcl-2 protein immunoprecipitated from HL-60 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, CDC2-cyclin B complex induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 with similar kinetics to that of histone H1, indicating that CDC2 kinase can directly phosphorylate Bcl-2. To verify the relevance of CDC2 in phosphorylating Bcl-2 underin vivo conditions, we examined the effects of butyrolactone I, a cell permeable inhibitor of CDC2 kinase (20.Furukawa Y. Iwase S. Terui Y. Kikuchi J. Sakai T. Nakamura M. Kitagawa S. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28469-28477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), on Bcl-2 phosphorylation induced by okadaic acid in HL-60 cells. Phosphorylation of pRB was simultaneously analyzed to monitor the inhibition of CDC2 activity. Bcl-2 phosphorylation was inhibited by butyrolactone I in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 A) and the kinetics of inhibition was similar to that of pRB (Fig. 3 B), indicating the specificity of inhibition. These results suggest that CDC2 is at least partially responsible for Bcl-2 phosphorylation in vivo.Figure 3Bcl-2 phosphorylation was inhibited by a cell permeable inhibitor of CDC2 kinase. A, HL-60 cells were cultured with 500 nm okadaic acid in the presence of various concentrations (0–20 μm) of butyrolactone I. Whole cell lysates were prepared after 16 h, and subjected to immunoblot analysis for Bcl-2 and pRB phosphorylation. B,relative levels of phosphorylation (the ratio of intensities of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated species) were determined by densitometer at each point, and expressed as % control with the level of cells cultured without butyrolactone I at 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we tried to determine the sites of phosphorylation by CDC2 in the Bcl-2 sequence. Within the Bcl-2 sequence, two sites (amino acid sequences 56–59 and 87–90) were found to match the consensus motif for CDC2 kinase; Ser/Thr-Pro-X-basic amino acid (27.Moreno S. Nurse P. Cell. 1990; 61: 549-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 28.Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We synthesized 2 peptides, designated as Bcl-2-56 and Bcl-2-87, corresponding to these putative CDC2 target sites for in vitro kinase assays (see Table I for the sequences). As controls, two peptides corresponding to residues 157–165 (Bcl-2-161) and 183–191 (Bcl-2-187) were simultaneously assayed, both of which contain serine or threonine but do not fulfill the consensus sequence for CDC2. Bcl-2-56 was shown to be phosphorylated by purified CDC2 kinase to an extent similar to SV40 large T antigen peptide, which is commonly used as a CDC2 substrate (29.McVey D. Brizuela L. Mohr I. Marshak D.R. Gluzman Y. Beach D. Nature. 1989; 341: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Table I). In contrast, CDC2 did not phosphorylate either Bcl-2-87 or the two control peptides, although the former contains the cognate consensus sequence.Table IPhosphorylation of Bcl-2 peptides by CDC2 kinasePeptideSequence (corresponding sites)aAmino acid positions are indicated in parentheses.Counts/min/samplebMean ± S.D., n = 4.Bcl-2–56PGHTPHPA (53–60)11,190.5 ± 1,596.6Bcl-2–87GPALSPVPP (83–91)1,206.3 ± 88.6Bcl-2–161MCVESVNRE (157–165)1,560.7 ± 108.9Bcl-2–187RHLHTWIQD (183–191)1,866.5 ± 131.2SV40 large THSTPPKKKRK (122–131)14,169.1 ± 1,024.7NonecNo peptides were included in the reaction mixture (background).1,656.5 ± 348.6a Amino acid positions are indicated in parentheses.b Mean ± S.D., n = 4.c No peptides were included in the reaction mixture (background). Open table in a new tab Next, we investigated how Bcl-2 phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation of two distinct functions of Bcl-2: anti-apoptosis and cell cycle inhibition. For this purpose, HL-60 cells were cultured with two different concentrations (500 and 10 nm) of okadaic acid to serially monitor the cell cycle profile and phosphorylation status of Bcl-2. The high dose of okadaic acid induced premature entry into mitosis, as indicated by chromatin condensation with a diploid content of DNA (data not shown and Ref. 23.Ishida Y. Furukawa Y. DeCaprio J.A. Saito M. Griffin J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), along with striking Bcl-2 phosphorylation after 16 h of treatment: the ratio of phosphorylated form/unphosphorylated form was 0.72 by densitometric comparison (Fig.4 A). No significant increase in sub-G1 fraction (apoptotic cells) was observed even after 16 h of culture. In the presence of low dose okadaic acid, HL-60 cells slowly accumulated in G2/M phases and underwent apoptosis after 48 h of culture (Fig. 4 B). This is fully consistent with our previous observation (23.Ishida Y. Furukawa Y. DeCaprio J.A. Saito M. Griffin J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 phosphorylation was induced during this process, but its level was far less than that with 500 nm okadaic acid: the phosphorylated form/unphosphorylated form ratio was 0.12 at 24 h and 0.09 at 48 h. It is of note that there was no difference in the level of Bcl-2 phosphorylation between 24- and 48-h samples, indicating that Bcl-2 phosphorylation is not correlated with the extent of apoptosis. This notion is also supported by the heavy phosphorylation of Bcl-2 without significant apoptosis in cells treated with 500 nmokadaic acid for 16 h. In keeping with this view, Bcl-2 phosphorylation was not observed in anti-Fas-treated HL-60 cells in which CDC2 was aberrantly activated in association with apoptosis without inducing G2/M accumulation (20.Furukawa Y. Iwase S. Terui Y. Kikuchi J. Sakai T. Nakamura M. Kitagawa S. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28469-28477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The above findings suggest that Bcl-2 phosphorylation by CDC2 is not a determinant of apoptosis but an event associated with M phase (including pseudo-M) entry. This hypothesis prompted us to investigate the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of Bcl-2 using normally cycling cells without any drug treatment. To this end, we separated exponentially growing HL-60 cells into fractions enriched for each phase of the cell cycle by centrifugal elutriation (21.Terui Y. Furukawa Y. Kikuchi J. Saito M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 5, fractions 1 and 2 almost exclusively consisted of cells in G0/G1 phases, fractions 3 and 4 were enriched for cells in S phase, fraction 5 contained a significant amount of cells in G2/M phases, and fraction 6 was further enriched for G2/M. In accord with the cell cycle profile of each fraction, CDC2 was present as a highly phosphorylated, inactive form in fractions 1 to 3, dephosphorylated in fraction 4 where cells prepare to enter M phase, and remained dephosphorylated in fractions 5 and 6 (Fig.5, upper panel). Histone H1 kinase activity was well correlated with the status of CDC2 in each fraction; it was significantly higher in fractions 4, 5, and 6 than in 1, 2, and 3. Bcl-2 phosphorylation was readily detectable in fractions 4–6 where CDC2 was activated. The maximal phosphorylation of Bcl-2 was observed in fraction 6, which was equivalent to that in HL-60 cells cultured with 500 nm okadaic acid for 4 h. Again, apoptosis was not associated with Bcl-2 phosphorylation in these fractions. These results suggest that phosphorylation plays a role in the cell cycle-related function of Bcl-2 rather than anti-apoptotic effect. To confirm that threonine 56 is a relevant site of phosphorylation by CDC2 in native Bcl-2 protein in vivo, we examined whether mutation at threonine 56 affected the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 during G2/M phases. For this purpose, we established HL-60 sublines overexpressing wild-type Bcl-2 (Bcl-2-WT) and mutated Bcl-2 in which threonine 56 was replaced by alanine (Bcl-2-T56A). There was no difference in the amounts of overexpressed Bcl-2 protein in the established cell lines (data not shown). The phosphorylation state of Bcl-2 in these cells was analyzed by 32P-metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig.6 A, Bcl-2 phosphorylation at G2/M was severely impaired in cells carrying the mutation at threonine 56. No significant effect on Bcl-2 phosphorylation was observed when mutation was introduced at serine 87 (Bcl-2-S87A) (data not shown). To obtain conclusive evidence that threonine 56 is a target for CDC2 in the context of full-length Bcl-2, we performed in vitro kinase assay using Bcl-2-T56A. Bcl-2 protein was immunoprecipitated from Bcl-2-WT and Bcl-2-T56A cell lines, phosphorylated by purified CDC2-cyclin B, and subjected to Bcl-2 immunoblotting and autoradiography. In vitro phosphorylation of wild type Bcl-2 by CDC2 resulted in the appearance of a shifted band (Fig. 6 B, left panel), which was shown to be the predominant32P-labeled form of Bcl-2 by autoradiography (Fig.6 B, right panel). In contrast, neither mobility shift nor32P incorporation was observed in Bcl-2-T56A, indicating that CDC2 phosphorylates Bcl-2 exclusively at threonine 56. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Bcl-2 is phosphorylated by CDC2 at threonine 56 during G2/M phases in vivo, although the involvement of other kinases in this process cannot be ruled out. Finally, we examined the effect of mutation at threonine 56, a putative phosphorylation site for CDC2, on the cell cycle-inhibitory function of Bcl-2. When mock-transfected HL-60 cells were released from M phase synchronization by washing out nocodazole, transition from M to G0/G1 phase started after 30 min, and the proportion of cells in G0/G1 became dominant over that in G2/M after 1 h. Further progression to S phase began after 24 h of the release (Fig.7, Mock). Overexpression of wild-type Bcl-2 delayed the transition from M phase to G0/G1 (Fig. 7, Bcl-2-WT), which is compatible with previous observations in different cell types (5.Linette G.P. Li Y. Roth K.

Gil-Gomez G. Kirberg J. Berns A.J.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6991-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The introduction of a non-phosphorylated mutation at residue 56 almost completely abrogated the cell cycle-inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 (Fig. 7,Bcl-2-T56A), whereas mutation at serine 87 did not (data not shown). In contrast, there was no significant difference in resistance to apoptosis between Bcl-2-WT, Bcl-2-T56A, and Bcl-2-S87A (TableII). Taken together, our present findings indicate that phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at threonine 56 by CDC2 is required for Bcl-2-mediated cell cycle inhibition, which may have some roles during mitosis in the normal cell cycle.Table IIInduction of apoptosis in Bcl-2-overexpressing cellsCell linesApoptotic cells (%)aThe cells were seeded at an initial concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml, and cultured for 4 h in the absence (none) or presence of either A23187 (5 μm) or cycloheximide (75 μg/ml).

This preference for calcium ions critically depended on the nucleoside residues at two specific positions of the deoxyribozyme core. The Ca(2+) specificity of 8-17 is strongly reminiscent of the properties of Mg5, an RNA phosphodiester-cleaving deoxyribozyme previously isolated by Faulhammer and Famulok (Faulhammer, D., and Famulok, M. (1996) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 35, 2837-2841). Indeed, analysis of the Mg5 sequence revealed the presence of a complete 8-17 motif, coincident with the conserved region of Mg5. An 8-17 deoxyribozyme modeled after the Mg5 conserved region displayed catalytic features comparable with those reported for the full-length Mg5 deoxyribozyme."
https://openalex.org/W1986048273,"Polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is thought to play a critical role in neural development. Polysialylation of NCAM was shown to be achieved by two α2,8-polysialyltransferases, ST8Sia IV (PST) and ST8Sia II (STX), which are moderately related to another α2,8-sialyltransferase, ST8Sia III. Here we describe that all three α2,8-sialyltransferases can utilize oligosaccharides as acceptors but differ in the efficiency of adding polysialic acid on NCAM. First, we found that ST8Sia III can form polysialic acid on the enzyme itself (autopolysialylation) but not on NCAM. These discoveries prompted us to determine if ST8Sia IV and ST8Sia II share the property of ST8Sia III in utilizing low molecular weight oligosaccharides as acceptors. By using a newly established method, we found that ST8Sia IV, ST8Sia II, and ST8Sia III all add oligosialic and polysialic acid on various sialylatedN-acetyllactosaminyl oligosaccharides, including NCAMN-glycans, fetuin N-glycans, synthetic sialylated N-acetyllactosamines, and on α2-HS-glycoprotein. Our results also showed that monosialyl and disialyl N-acetyllactosamines can serve equally as an acceptor, suggesting that no initial addition of α2,8-sialic acid is necessary for the action of polysialyltransferases. Polysialylation of NCAM by ST8Sia IV and ST8Sia II is much more efficient than polysialylation of N-glycans isolated from NCAM. Moreover, ST8Sia IV and ST8Sia II catalyze polysialylation of NCAM much more efficiently than ST8Sia III. These results suggest that no specific acceptor recognition is involved in polysialylation of low molecular weight sialylated oligosaccharides, whereas the enzymes exhibit pronounced acceptor specificities if glycoproteins are used as acceptors.

This unique glycan is mainly attached to the fifth immunoglobulin-like domain of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)1 via a typical N-linked glycosylation (3.Nelson R.W. Bates P.A.

Although the majority of NCAM in adult tissues lacks this unique glycan, polysialylated NCAM is present in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus of adult brain where neuronal regeneration persists (5.Rutishauser U.

NCAM knockout mice exhibit an abnormal formation of olfactory bulb and hippocampus and a defect in spatial learning and memory, which may be caused by dysfunction of the hippocampus (12.Tomasiewicz H.

Such a phenotype appears to be due to the loss of polysialic acid in these regions of the brain because treatment with endoneuraminidase-N (endo-N), a specific glycosidase for polysialic acid, resulted in the impairment of cell migration in the subventricular zone of the olfactory bulb (14.Ono K.

Taken together, these results strongly suggest that polysialylated NCAM plays a critical role in neural development and plasticity. The cDNAs encoding polysialyltransferases have been cloned, and these enzymes are called ST8Sia IV (PST) and ST8Sia II (STX) (15.Livingston B.D. Pauson J.C. J. Biol.

They belong to the α2,8-sialyltransferase gene family and are highly homologous to each other, having 59% identity at the amino acid levels (16.Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J.

By using an in vitro assay system, both ST8Sia IV and ST8Sia II were shown to directly add polysialic acid to fetuin and NCAM (20.Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21.Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Curr.

This demonstrates that either ST8Sia IV or ST8Sia II alone can form polysialic acid by adding the first α2,8-linked sialic acid to α2,3- or α2,6-linked sialic acid in a glycoprotein acceptor, followed by the multiple addition of α2,8-linked sialic acid residues. However, it has not been determined if ST8Sia IV or ST8Sia II can add polysialic acid more efficiently on a preformed disialyl structure, NeuNAcα2→8NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc→R. In addition to ST8Sia IV and ST8Sia II, three more α2,8-sialyltransferases have been molecularly cloned. Among them, ST8Sia III (24.Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) is more closely related to ST8Sia IV or ST8Sia II than to ST8Sia I (GD3/GT3 synthase) (25.Nara K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29366-29371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These studies also demonstrated that ST8Sia I and ST8Sia V utilize glycolipids as acceptors, whereas ST8Sia III forms disialic and oligosialic acid in both glycoproteins and glycolipids. On the other hand, it was shown previously that colominic acid, a polymer of α2,8-linked sialic acid, did not serve as an acceptor for polysialyltransferases (30.McCoy R.D. Vimr E.R. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12695-12699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that ST8Sia IV and ST8Sia II can add polysialic acid only on sialylated N-glycans attached to NCAM becauseN-glycans released from NCAM did not serve as acceptors (22.Kojima N. Tachida Y. Yoshida Y. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19457-19463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ST8Sia IV and ST8Sia II cannot utilize free N-glycans as acceptors. In the present study, we first describe the unexpected discovery that ST8Sia III can form polysialic acid. This discovery prompted us to determine if polysialyltransferases and ST8Sia III differ in the mode of actions and products formed. By using a newly developed assay, we found that both polysialyltransferases and ST8Sia III form polysialic acid on oligosaccharide acceptors and can form oligosialic and polysialic acid also on the disialyl acceptor (NeuNAcα2→8NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc→R). In contrast, we demonstrated that ST8Sia IV and ST8Sia II are much more efficient in polysialylation on NCAM than ST8Sia III. These results strongly suggest that ST8Sia IV and ST8Sia II apparently evolved to participate in NCAM polysialylation from a primordial enzyme that adds α2,8-sialic acid to low molecular weight acceptors. A cDNA harboring a catalytic domain of human ST8Sia III was obtained as follows. First, cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase, Superscript™ II (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the human fetal brain mRNA (CLONTECH) and a 3′-primer, 5′-TTGGAGTTCTTAGGCACAGTG-3′, which is complementary to nucleotides 1131–1151 (numbered 1–3 for the codon encoding the initiation methionine) of the mouse ST8Sia III sequence (24.Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out to obtain a catalytic domain using the formed cDNA as a template and 5′-primer and 3′-nested primer. Both primers were adapted from the mouse ST8Sia III sequence (nucleotides 113–130 and 1125–1147, respectively) (24.Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and BglII andXhoI sites are included in these primers. To obtain the human 5′-upstream cDNA sequence, 5′-RACE was performed by the RACE System (Life Technologies, Inc.) using primers that are complementary to nucleotides 225–244 and 211–230, respectively, in the human ST8Sia III sequence determined above. The RACE product was digested at a SalI site in the anchor sequence and at an internal XbaI site and cloned into the same sites of pBluescript II (Stratagene). To construct an intact form of human ST8Sia III, 5′-end sequence was amplified by PCR using the vector harboring the 5′-RACE product as a template. The upstream primer is 5′-CGTAAGCTTACACGCCAGCGAGCT-3′ (HindIII is underlined), in which the last 16 nucleotides correspond to nucleotides −72 to −57. The downstream primer was adapted from the flanking vector sequence. The PCR product thus obtained was digested by HindIII and XbaI, and this fragment was appended to the 5′-end XbaI site (nucleotides 201–206) of a large cDNA fragment (encompassing nucleotides 113–1145), producing a full-length cDNA encoding human ST8Sia III. The ligated cDNA was cloned into HindIII andXhoI sites of pcDNAI (Invitrogen), resulting in pcDNAI-ST8Sia III. To obtain the 3′-end sequence, P1 plasmid human genomic DNA library was screened using PCR as described (23.Angata K. Nakayama J. Fredette B. Chong K. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7182-7190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 28.Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Hirabayashi Y. Kanamori A. Sasaki K. Nishi T. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3684-3691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Upstream and downstream primers for this PCR correspond to nucleotides 890–911 and nucleotides 1110–1130 of the human ST8Sia III sequence, respectively. Purified DNA from one of the P1 clones was cloned into pUC19 vector, and the plasmid containing the ST8Sia III sequence was identified by PCR. By using the above upstream primer, its nucleotide sequence was determined. pcDNAI-A encoding a signal peptide and an IgG binding domain of protein A was prepared as described before (4.Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encompassing nucleotides 113 to 1145 of human ST8Sia III was obtained as described above and digested by BglII and XhoI. It was then ligated to BamHI site of the 3′-end of pcDNAI-A insert and XhoI site of the vector, resulting in pcDNAI-A·ST8Sia III. pcDNAI-ST8Sia IV harboring cDNA encoding the full-length human ST8Sia IV and pcDNAI-A·ST8Sia IV harboring cDNA encoding a soluble chimeric ST8Sia IV were constructed as described previously (17.Nakayama J.

The substrate solution (50 μl) contained 10 pmol of NCAM·IgG containing 60 pmol of N-glycans, 30 pmol of α2-HS-glycoprotein containing 60 pmol of N-glycans (Sigma) or 60 pmol or 1 nmol of synthetic oligosaccharides, colominic acid, or NCAMN-glycans, and 2.4 nmol (0.7 mCi) of CMP-[14C]NeuNAc in the same reaction mixture described (4.Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To this substrate solution, 50 μl of the enzyme solution, prepared as described above, was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h or 18 h. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography as described previously (20.Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Products obtained from α2-HS-glycoprotein and NCAM·IgG were purified by microcon 30 (Amicon) to remove free CMP-[14C]NeuNAc and digested with N-glycanase as described above. After incubation of fetuin oligosaccharides, NCAM oligosaccharides, colominic acid, and α2,3-sialylated or α2,6-sialylated oligosaccharide, NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→octyl or NeuNAcα2→8NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→octyl, the reaction mixtures were directly analyzed by HPLC. Products obtained from sialylparagloboside were purified by reverse-phase column chromatography using TSK-GEL® ODS-80Ts (TosoHAAS) column at room temperature. After elution with buffer A, 200 mmammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, for 10 min, the column was eluted with linear gradient elution to 100% of acetonitrile in the subsequent 80 min. The oligosaccharides were released by endoglycoceramidase II (36, Calbiochem) from unbound (fractions 1–10) and bound (fractions 11–40) fractions, and the resultant oligosaccharides were subjected to Mono-Q chromatography (see below). The products were separated by Mono-Q HPLC using the elution conditions modified from those previously reported (2.Livingston B.D. Jacobs J.L. Glick M.C. Troy F.A., II J. Biol.

Mono-QHR 5/5 (0.5 × 5 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was equilibrated with the solvent A, 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then eluted with three-step linear gradient elution using the solvent B, 1 mNaCl and 10% acetonitrile in 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a Gilson 306 HPLC. After elution with solvent A for 10 min, the linear gradient elution was carried out from 0% to 33% of the solvent B in 80 min and then to 45% of solvent B in the next 50 min and, finally, to 100% of the solvent B in the last 10 min. After eluting with 100% of solvent B for an additional 10 min, the column was equilibrated again with solvent A. The sample was co-injected with partial hydrolysates of colominic acid to determine the degree of polymerization. Sialic oligomers and polymers were detected by the adsorption atA 214 nm, whereas the oligosaccharides were detected by determining the radioactivity of the effluent by scintillation counting as described previously (4.Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To isolate cDNA encoding human ST8Sia III, we cloned the cDNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR using human brain poly(A)+ RNA based on the mouse ST8Sia III sequence (22.Kojima N. Tachida Y. Yoshida Y. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19457-19463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which was then amended by the 5′-RACE, resulting in the full-length ST8Sia III. Fig. 1 shows the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of human ST8Sia III. The amino acid sequence of human ST8Sia III has 34.8% and 33.3% identity with that of human ST8Sia IV (PST, 17) and ST8Sia II (STX, 19, 23), respectively (identical amino acid residues are shown in capital lettersin Fig. 1). The homology between ST8Sia III and ST8Sia IV or ST8Sia II is extensive in both sialyl motif L and S (see double andsingle underlines). However, this homology extends to the whole region of a presumed catalytic domain, in particular to the amino acid sequence close to the carboxyl terminus. The position of the introns was deduced by comparison of the cDNA sequence with the genomic sequence deposited into the GenBank™ data base (accession number AC003971). This genomic sequence was identified in chromosome 18. Consistent with this assignment, we determined the ST8Sia III locus at chromosome 18, q21.2 using fluorescence in situhybridization (data not shown). Human ST8Sia III is less similar to other α2,8-sialyltransferases (29.8% identity with ST8Sia I (28.Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Hirabayashi Y. Kanamori A. Sasaki K. Nishi T. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

As a part of systematic studies on sialic acid polymers synthesized by ST8Sia III, HeLa cells stably expressing ST8Sia III cDNA, HeLa-ST8Sia III, were examined. As shown in Fig.2, permeabilized HeLa cells expressing ST8Sia III and NCAM were heavily stained by 12F8 (38.Chung W.-W. Lagenaur C.F. Yan Y. Lund J.S. J. Comp. Neurol. 1991; 314: 290-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or 735 antibody (39.Frosch M. Görgen I. Boulnois G.J. Timmis K.N. Bitter-Suermann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This staining disappeared after endo-N treatment, which cleaves polysialic acid (data not shown). The same cells without permeabilization were, however, negative for anti-polysialic acid antibody staining (Fig. 2). The results suggest that ST8Sia III forms polysialic acid on glycoproteins other than NCAM, which was expressed on the cell surface. HeLa cells stably transfected with ST8Sia IV or ST8Sia II cDNA were positive before or after permeabilization, whereas HeLa cells expressing ST8Sia I were negative for both intracellular and cell surface staining (Fig.2). More than 50% of all these transfected cells expressed similar amounts of cell surface NCAM detected by immunofluorescent staining as described (23.Angata K. Nakayama J. Fredette B. Chong K.

We produced recombinant proteins containing the disintegrin-like domain of mADAM 2 in both insect cells and in bacteria. The protein produced in insect cells (baculo D+C) contained a signal sequence followed by the disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains; it was purified from the medium of recombinant baculovirus-infected cells. A bacterial construct containing the disintegrin-like domain was produced inEscherichia coli as a glutathioneS-transferase chimera. Baculo D+C, as well as the D domain of the bacterial construct (released with thrombin), bound to the microvillar surface of murine eggs. Using concentrations in the range of 1 to 5 μm, both recombinant proteins strongly inhibited sperm-egg binding and fusion; the baculovirus-produced protein exhibited a somewhat greater extent of inhibition (∼75versus ∼55% maximal inhibition). Substitution of alanine for each of the five charged residues within the disintegrin loop of mADAM 2 revealed a critical importance for the aspartic acid at position nine. Binding of both recombinant proteins to the egg was inhibited by the function blocking anti-α6 monoclonal antibody, GoH3, but not by a nonfunction-blocking anti-α6monoclonal antibody.

Following their metalloprotease and disintegrin-like domains, they contain a cysteine-rich domain, an EGF repeat, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. Their closest relatives are the P-III snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs), which are secreted proteins that contain a disintegrin-like and a metalloprotease domain as well as a cysteine-rich domain. P-II SVMPs contain metalloprotease and disintegrin domains but lack the cysteine-rich (and other) domains. The disintegrin domains of the P-II SVMPs have a 13-amino acid loop containing, at their tips, sequences such as RGD (kistrin and echistatin), KGD (barbourin), and MVD (atrolysin E). Several P-II snake disintegrins have been shown to bind to the platelet integrin, αIIbβ3, thereby preventing binding of fibrinogen and inhibiting platelet aggregation. Inhibition of platelet aggregation accounts, in part, for the severe hemorrhagic response in snakebite victims. The disintegrin-like domains of P-III SVMPs differ from their P-II counterparts in having two additional cysteine residues and a 14-residue predicted loop that aligns with the 13-amino acid “RGD” loop found in the P-II disintegrins. One of the additional cysteine residues is near the center of the disintegrin loop.The disintegrin-like domain of the P-III SVMP atrolysin A has been characterized. Atrolysin A purified from snake venom inhibits ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation with IC50 values of ∼0.24 and ∼0.11 μm, respectively. A recombinant protein produced in insect cells containing the disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains of atrolysin A inhibits ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation with similar IC50 values of ∼0.3 and ∼0.47 μm, respectively. In contrast, a peptide analogue of the disintegrin loop of atrolysin A blocks collagen-induced platelet aggregation with an IC50 of ∼300 μm(3.Jia L.-G. Wang X.-M. Shannon J.D. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W.

A recombinant protein consisting of the disintegrin-like domain of hADAM 15, appended to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) and expressed in E. coli, was shown to bind to cells expressing the αvβ3integrin but not to cells expressing other integrins including α6β1 and α5β1. Mutation of the RGD tripeptide to SGA blocked binding to αvβ3 (19.Zhang X.-P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A chimeric protein containing the entire extracellular domain of hADAM 15 attached to the IgG heavy chain and expressed in mammalian cells has been shown to bind to cells that express the αvβ3 or α5β1 integrins. This binding was inhibited by an RGD peptide (20.Nath D. Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E. Warn A. Hutchinson G.R. Yamada K.M. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. J.

(ii) Sperm bind more avidly to α6-transfected cells than to their mock-transfected counterparts as well as to cells expressingversus those engineered not to express the β1integrin subunit. (iii) Sperm binding to somatic cells expressing α6β1 is specifically inhibited by the function-blocking anti-α6 mAb, GoH3, as well as a disintegrin loop peptide (4.Almeida E.A.C. Huovila A.-P.J.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Recent work from our laboratory, using mADAM 2 purified from sperm and captured onto fluorescent beads, is consistent with this conclusion: bead binding is inhibited by the anti-α6 mAb GoH3 and by a disintegrin loop peptide analogue (21.Chen M.S. Almeida E.A.C. Huovila A.-P.J. Takahashi Y. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, recent work has shown that a radioiodinated and photoactivatable peptide analogue of the disintegrin loop of mADAM 2 binds to the egg integrin α6β1 (6.Chen H. Sampson N.S. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, results using a maltose-binding protein chimera of the entire extracellular domain of mature mADAM 2 produced in E. coliwere interpreted as evidence that mADAM 2 interacts with a β1 integrin on the egg but not with α6β1 (22.Evans J.P. Kopf G.S. Schultz R.M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).To gain a better appreciation for the biochemical and biological properties of the disintegrin-like domains of ADAM proteins and to test whether recombinant disintegrin domain-containing constructs of mADAM 2 can interact with the α6β1 integrin, we expressed proteins containing either the disintegrin-like domain or the disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains of mADAM 2 in both insect and bacterial cells. Recombinant proteins produced in both bacterial and insect cells bound to the egg surface and inhibited sperm-egg binding and fusion. A point mutant within the disintegrin loop (D9A) strongly reduced the ability of the recombinant mADAM 2 disintegrin domain to inhibit sperm-egg binding and fusion. In addition, binding of recombinant mADAM 2 disintegrin domains produced in both insect cells and in bacteria was inhibited by a function-blocking antibody against the α6 integrin subunit as well as by reagents that target the disintegrin loop of mADAM 2.DISCUSSIONADAM 2 (fertilin β) is a glycoprotein that is essential for murine fertilization (31.Cho C.

Like all ADAMs, ADAM 2 contains a disintegrin-like domain with a clearly identifiable disintegrin loop (32.Bigler D. Chen M. Waters S. White J.M.

In addition, three independent studies, using either peptide analogues of the mADAM 2 disintegrin loop (4.Almeida E.A.C. Huovila A.-P.J. Sutherland A.E. Stephens L.E. Calarco P.G. Shaw L.M.

White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), have suggested that the disintegrin domain of mADAM 2 interacts with the egg integrin α6β1. However, another study, which employed a recombinant form of mADAM2 produced in bacteria as a maltose-binding protein chimera, concluded that mADAM 2 binds to a β1 integrin on the egg but not to α6β1 (22.Evans J.P. Kopf G.S. Schultz R.M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A goal of the present study was, therefore, to test whether recombinant mADAM 2 disintegrin domain-containing constructs can interact with the α6β1 integrin. A second goal was to compare properties of recombinant disintegrin domain-containing constructs produced in insect cells and in bacteria. A third goal was to analyze the role of charged residues within the disintegrin loop.The Disintegrin-like Domain of Mouse ADAM 2 Interacts with the α6β1 IntegrinTo test the hypothesis that the disintegrin domain of mADAM 2 interacts with the egg integrin α6β1, we produced recombinant disintegrin domain-containing constructs of mADAM 2 in insect cells using the baculovirus system as well as in E. coli. Our baculovirus construct encoded both the disintegrin-like (D) and cysteine-rich (C) domains of mADAM 2 and was purified from the medium of baculovirus-infected cells; it was similar to a construct of the P-III SVMP, atrolysin A, described by Fox and co-workers (3.Jia L.-G.

Our bacterial constructs encoded the D domain of mADAM 2 fused to GST; it was similar to a construct of hADAM 15 prepared by Takada and co-workers (19.Zhang X.-P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K.

Fluorescent beads coated with either protein bound to the egg, and in both cases, bead-binding was inhibited by the function-blocking anti-α6 integrin mAb, GoH3, but not by the nonfunction-blocking anti-α6 integrin mAb, J1B5. 6We recently presented a preliminary demonstration of the inhibitory effect of GoH3 on binding of the bacterially produced D protein (37.Chen M.S. Tung K.S.K. Coonrod S.A. Takahashi Y. Bigler D. Chang A. Yamashita Y. Kincade P.W. Herr J.C. White J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11830-11835Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Therefore, as shown for mature mADAM 2 purified from sperm (21.Chen M.S. Almeida E.A.C. Huovila A.-P.J. Takahashi Y. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), binding (to eggs) of recombinant disintegrin-like domain-containing constructs of mADAM 2 produced in both insect cells and in bacteria, can be specifically inhibited by a function-blocking anti-α6integrin mAb.The concentration of GoH3 needed to inhibit binding of mature mADAM 2 isolated from sperm (21.Chen M.S. Almeida E.A.C. Huovila A.-P.J. Takahashi Y. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or recombinant mADAM 2 disintegrin domain-containing constructs is 100 μg to 200 μg/ml. This is ∼10-fold higher than the concentration of GoH3 needed to inhibit α6-mediated cell adhesion to laminin (38.Chen L. Shick V. Matter M.L. Laurie S.M. Ogle R.C. Laurie G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L494-L503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We consider three possibilities to explain these observations. The first is that the ADAM 2 D domain interacts with a different isoform of α6 than the one that binds laminin, perhaps an alternate splice form in its ectodomain (39.Delwel G.O. Kuikman I. Sonnenberg A. Cell Adhes. Comm. 1995; 3: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The second, as suggested by our recent findings (21.Chen M.S. Almeida E.A.C. Huovila A.-P.J. Takahashi Y. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 37.Chen M.S. Tung K.S.K. Coonrod S.A. Takahashi Y. Bigler D. Chang A. Yamashita Y. Kincade P.W. Herr J.C. White J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11830-11835Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), is that the ADAM 2 D domain interacts with an alternate state of α6. A third is that ADAM 2 interacts with an α6-like integrin on the egg. We propose that the presumptive alternate α6 has a lower affinity for GoH3 than the classic form and hence that higher concentrations of GoH3 are needed to inhibit its function. In recent work we have provided evidence that the tetraspan integrin-associated protein CD9 is involved in binding mADAM 2 (37.Chen M.S. Tung K.S.K. Coonrod S.A. Takahashi Y. Bigler D. Chang A. Yamashita Y. Kincade P.W. Herr J.C. White J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11830-11835Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Hence we are presently considering three models for how the mADAM 2 D domain may interact with a complex of “α6” and CD9 on the egg (Fig.8). The D domain may interact with α6 (Fig. 8 A), with sites on both α6 and CD9 (Fig. 8 B) or with CD9 (Fig.8 C) within the complex. Current experiments are aimed at testing these possibilities.Comparison of Baculo D+C with the Disintegrin-like Domain-containing Construct of Atrolysin A Produced in Insect CellsWe modeled our first construct, baculo D+C, after a construct of the P-III SVMP atrolysin A, a construct that has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation (3.Jia L.-G. Wang X.-M. Shannon J.D. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13094-13102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We chose to use a eukaryotic expression system for our first construct because the D and C domains of ADAMs are predicted to be glycosylated and because they each contain unusually high and odd numbers of cysteines. In addition, it has been shown that multidomain proteins fold better in eukaryotic, than in prokaryotic, systems (40.Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Based on these considerations, we chose to purify the baculo D+C that was secreted into the culture medium, even though a significant fraction was retained within the cells. 7D. Bigler, M. S. Chen, and J. M. White, unpublished results. mADAM 2 baculo D+C maximally inhibited sperm-egg binding and fusion in the concentration range of ∼0.5 to 5 μm. The atrolysin A D+C construct inhibited platelet aggregation with an IC50 of 0.3–0.4 μm. From our data (Fig. 4, A andB), baculo D+C (mADAM 2) appears to have a potency similar to that of recombinant atrolysin A D+C. The potencies of both mADAM 2 D+C and atrolysin A D+C produced in insect cells are considerably higher than those of peptide analogues of their respective disintegrin loops, which are inhibitory at ∼200–500 μm (3.Jia L.-G.

Of note, and possibly reflecting the difficulty of folding multidomain proteins in bacterial systems (40.Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), GST-D+C was protease sensitive, was not produced in high yield, and proved difficult to purify. The GST-D construct was, however, readily produced and purified. GST-D inhibited sperm-egg binding and fusion with good potency (maximal inhibition with 1–5 μm protein). Although maximally inhibitory in a similar range of concentrations, the maximum extent of inhibition seen with GST-D was somewhat lower than that seen with baculo D+C. The facts, however, that GST-D demonstrated a high level of potency and ran as a single species on both reducing and nonreducing SDS gels may indicate that the GST protein facilitated folding of the downstream D domain, perhaps during purification over glutathione-agarose columns (i.e. under reducing conditions).It is difficult to compare the potency of the mADAM 2 GST-D domain produced here with the previously described maltose-binding protein chimera of the mature fertilin β extracellular domain (β-DCE), because data for only two concentrations of β-DCE were reported: ∼6 μm β-DCE inhibited sperm-egg binding by ∼50% and 3 μm β-DCE showed no significant inhibitory effect (18.Evans J.P. Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Hence, the GST-D construct (Fig. 4 C) appears to be a more potent inhibitor than the maltose-binding protein chimera.The only other ADAM that has, to date, been shown to interact with an integrin is hADAM 15, which is unique in containing an RGD sequence in its disintegrin loop. The hADAM 15 D domain made as a GST chimera, as well as a construct containing the entire extracellular domain of hADAM 15 fused to the Fc portion of IgG, were shown to support binding in solid phase cell binding assays to the αvβ3integrin. The Fc chimeric protein also interacted with α5β1. However the potencies of these ADAM 15 constructs, for example in inhibiting integrin-mediated binding to fibronectin, were not reported (19.Zhang X.-P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 20.Nath D. Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E. Warn A. Hutchinson G.R. Yamada K.M.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 579-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Sequence Specificity of the Inhibitory Activity of the mADAM 2 Disintegrin DomainAs expected, the interaction of our mADAM 2 disintegrin domain-containing constructs with eggs was inhibited by a peptide analogue of and by an antibody against the disintegrin loop. We therefore employed a mutagenesis approach to begin to assess the sequence requirements of the disintegrin loop. Given the considerably higher potency of GST-D (Fig. 4) compared with peptide analogues of the disintegrin loop (4.Almeida E.A.C. Huovila A.-P.J. Sutherland A.E. Stephens L.E. Calarco P.G. Shaw L.M.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), we generated mutant GST-D proteins. The sequence of the mADAM 2 disintegrin loop isCRLAQDECDVTEYC. Theunderlined residues are absolutely conserved among all known ADAM 2 orthologues, and the sixth residue in the loop is generally (in five of seven sequences) a negatively charged residue (D or E). Given what is known about critical residues in P-II disintegrins, it was predicted that residues in the middle of the disintegrin loop (i.e. QDECD) would be especially important (42.Blobel C.P. White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Using alanine substituted peptides, Fox and co-workers (3.Jia L.-G. Wang X.-M. Shannon J.D. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13094-13102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have shown an important role for the negatively charged residues Glu7and, especially, Asp9 (underlined residues) in the disintegrin loop (CRPARSECDIAESC) of the P-III SVMP, atrolysin A. In our study using a recombinant disintegrin domain prepared in E. coli, we found a critical and dominant importance for residue Asp9 in the mADAM 2 disintegrin loop (Fig. 5 A), suggesting parallels to atrolysin A. In addition, the simultaneous presence of the two consecutive negatively charged residues (Asp6 and Glu7) preceding the central cysteine of the mADAM 2 disintegrin loop seems to enhance activity. The other charged residues near the N- and C-terminal ends of the loop (Arg2 and Glu12) do not appear to play major roles.ConclusionsIn conclusion, our findings with recombinant proteins produced in both bacterial and insect cells are consistent with the proposal that the disintegrin-like domain of mADAM 2 interacts, either directly or indirectly, with an α6integrin on the egg. Our findings further suggest that although a disintegrin-like domain-containing construct of mADAM 2 produced in insect cells appears to be somewhat more potent, a GST-D construct (19.Zhang X.-P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) of mADAM 2 exerts considerable inhibitory activity in the same range of protein concentrations and interacts with the egg surface in a similar manner to the protein produced in insect cells. Using GST-D constructs with mutations in the charged residues of the mADAM 2 disintegrin loop, we have demonstrated a critical importance for the aspartic acid immediately after the central cysteine.Note Added in ProofFemale mice that lack CD9 (see Fig. 8) show seve"

In this work, we observed that addition of iron improved the respiratory growth of the sod1 mutant and in glucose medium total intracellular iron content was higher in the sod1mutant than in wild type cells. Transcription of the high affinity iron transporter gene, FET3, was enhanced in thesod1 mutant, suggesting that iron transport systems were up-regulated. An sod1/fet3 double mutant showed increased sensitivity to oxygen and increased transcription of FET4, an alternative, low affinity, iron transporter. We propose that this increased iron demand in the sod1 mutant may be a reflection of the cells' efforts to reconstitute iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes that are continuously inactivated in conditions of excess superoxide.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2672) Google Scholar, 2.Valentine J.S. Wertz D.L. Lyons T.J. Liou L.L. Goto J.J. Gralla E.B. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Biol. 1998; 201: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Saccharomyces cerevisiae, like other eukaryotes, contains two intracellular SODs, one containing manganese and the other copper and zinc in their respective active sites. The MnSOD (product of theSOD2 gene) is localized in the mitochondrial matrix and CuZnSOD (product of the SOD1 gene) is distributed in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and other compartments. Neither SOD1 orSOD2 is strictly essential; however, the loss ofSOD1 has dramatic phenotypic consequences in yeast (for review, see Ref. 4.Gralla E.B. Scandalios J. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 495-525Google Scholar). Yeast strains lacking CuZnSOD (sod1) show several defects during aerobic growth, including reduced rates of growth, auxotrophies for lysine and methionine or cysteine, poor growth by respiration (in glycerol or ethanol), higher rates of spontaneous mutation, and more rapid loss of viability in stationary phase (4.Gralla E.B.

Knowledge about the exact biochemical causes of these defects is limited, but most genetic suppressors of the sod1 deletion mutation are involved in metal metabolism (8.Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Two suppressor mutations, pmr1 andbsd2, were isolated by their ability to rescue the lysine and methionine auxotrophies of the sod1/sod2 double mutant. The PMR1 gene encodes a P-type ATPase involved in transport of calcium and manganese into the Golgi apparatus (8.Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); pmr1mutants accumulate manganese in the cytoplasm. BSD2 is a gene whose deletion causes an increase in the intracellular copper levels (9.Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7037-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The metabolic deficiencies of the sod1/sod2mutant are also rescued by overexpression of the ATX1 gene, which encodes a small cytoplasmic copper carrier (11.Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and by overexpression of the ATX2 gene, which results in increased intracellular manganese (10.Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6303-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Both manganese and copper ions are scavengers of superoxide in vitro (12.Liao Z. Liu W. Liu J. Jiang Y. Shi J. Liu C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1994; 55: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13.Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4502) Google Scholar), and it is believed that a similar activity in vivo may be the mechanism by which all these mutations suppress the defects ofsod1/sod2 yeast. Recently, three mutations that suppress defects in the sod1single mutant have been identified (14.Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Two of them (ssq1and jac1) are mutations in genes for mitochondrial chaperone proteins (hsp70 and hsp20, respectively). The third suppressor,nfs1, is thought to function in the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters. All three show impaired respiration, decreased oxygen consumption, and reduced aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase activities. Superoxide radical has been shown to inactivate certain [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing enzymes by oxidizing one iron, causing its release from the cluster (1.Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2672) Google Scholar, 15.Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). This process leads to both enzyme inactivation and further oxidative damage of other cellular components, as “free” iron can promote, via the Fenton reaction, the formation of hydroxyl radicals (⋅OH) (16.Fridovich I. Science. 1978; 201: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar, 17.Meneghini R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Thus, superoxide dismutase both protects the [4Fe-4S] enzymes from inactivation and prevents the accumulation of excess intracellular iron. It is not clear whether the inactive 3Fe-4S form of the cluster can be reactivated in vivo by reinsertion of the single iron ion, or whether the whole cluster must be removed and replaced. InEscherichia coli, there is evidence suggesting that under certain conditions the single iron can be replaced. A mutation that increases the intracellular concentration of an Fe2+chelator is an effective suppressor of multiple defects ofsod − mutants and may function by providing an abundant supply of Fe2+ that can be used to convert [3Fe-4S] to [4Fe-4S] clusters (18.Maringanti S. Imlay J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3792-3802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because iron can play an important role in oxidative stress and yet is essential for cellular growth, its uptake is tightly regulated in both yeast and mammalian systems (19.Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Bioinorganic Chem. 1996; 1: 494-499Google Scholar, 20.de Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, two plasma membrane proteins, Fre1p and Fre2p, reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+, a function that is critical for iron uptake (20.de Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21.Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In iron-replete conditions, Fe2+ is then transported by Fet4p, the low affinity iron transporter (22.Dix D. Bridgham J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11770-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Under low iron conditions, a high affinity iron transport system is used that proceeds via the coupled functions of the cell surface Fet3p multicopper oxidase, which catalyzes the conversion of Fe2+ to Fe3+, and the Ftr1p permease, which transports the iron (23.Askwith C.

In this work we explore iron metabolism of sod1 mutant yeast. We observed that addition of iron to the media improved the respiratory growth of sod1 mutants and that the mutant yeast under normal growth conditions accumulate excess iron and show increase expression of iron transport genes. We propose that these alterations in the iron status of the sod1 mutant may be a reflection of the cells' efforts continually to reconstitute [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing enzymes that have been inactivated by excess superoxide.

For routine pregrowth, strains lacking CuZnSOD activity were cultured in microaerophilic conditions (5% oxygen) using CampyPaks (BBL) for plates or, for liquid cultures, 5 ml of medium in a 16 × 100-mm culture tube. For flask cultures, low aeration was achieved by decreasing the surface to volume ratio and/or reducing the shaking rate to 100 rpm. High aeration for experimental samples was achieved by using a flask volume/medium volume ratio of 5:1 (typically 50 ml of medium in a 250-ml flask) shaking at 200 rpm. For anaerobic conditions, cells were inoculated into 250-ml flasks containing 50 ml of degassed SDC medium and grown with shaking at 200 rpm under a slow stream of nitrogen. Samples grown in YPG were inoculated at 1–2 × 106 cells/ml and cultured for 18 h. Growth was followed by monitoring the turbidity at 600 nm (A 600); an A 600 of 1 corresponds to 1 × 107 cells/ml. All growth was at 30 °C. For the experiments shown in Fig. 2, cells were grown in rich YPD liquid medium under low aeration for 18 h, diluted to 107, 106, and 105 cells/ml, and 5-μl aliquots from each dilution were spotted onto YPD plates. Plates were incubated at 30 °C under aerobic (20% oxygen) or microaerobic (5% oxygen) conditions, and growth was observed after 3 days. Cellular oxygen uptake was measured at 30 °C in a 3-ml stirred chamber using a YSI model 53 biological oxygen monitor (Yellow Springs Instruments) following the manufacturer's directions. Cells were cultured in YPG with or without 300 μm iron added in flasks under high aeration as described above. (Each overnight culture was split into with and without iron flasks.) For the oxygen uptake measurement, cells were resuspended at 4–5 × 107 cells/ml in the same (spent) culture medium, and conditions that resembled the flask environment (30 °C and stirring) were maintained in the chamber. Yeast cultures (25 ml in a 125-ml flask or 50 ml in a 250-ml flask) were grown in the indicated liquid medium for 18 h, collected by centrifugation, and washed twice with 10 mm EDTA and once with metal free water. Cell pellets (1.5 × 108 cells) were digested in 1 ml of 3% nitric acid (HNO3) at 98 °C overnight. After digestion, the samples were diluted to 5 ml with metal-free water and analyzed using a Perkin Elmer ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer) to determine the metal content (32.Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). All samples were measured 10 times, and the experiments were repeated at least twice. The data are expressed as picomoles of metal/107 cells. Alternatively, measurements were made using a Thermo Jarrell Ash Iris 1000 ICP-AE (inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission) instrument.

Briefly, probes were labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Yeast were grown in SDC for 18 h, and total RNA was isolated and hybridized overnight at 55 °C with either theFET3 or FET4 probe and the CMD probe. The RNA was incubated with 50 units of S1 nuclease and then applied to a 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried onto 3MM Whatman paper and submitted to PhosphorImager quantitation. Cultures of cells harboring a multicopy FET3::lacZ fusion plasmid were grown for 18 h. Samples were collected, and β-galactosidase assay was performed using the substrateο-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactose as described (34.Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by Bradford method (35.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211805) Google Scholar). Providing glycerol as the sole carbon source forces yeast to grow by respiration. Addition of iron (0.3–1 mm) to rich glycerol media improved the ability of the sod1 mutant to grow by respiratory metabolism (Fig.1), indicating a higher iron requirement for optimal growth in the mutant. In order to further explore the relationship between iron metabolism and the mechanisms by which cells compensate for the loss of the sod1 gene, we constructed an isogenic family of strains missing the high affinity iron transporter Fet3p as well as SOD1. As expected, the fet3 mutant showed a respiratory growth defect in low iron medium, which could be suppressed by iron supplementation (Fig. 1 and data not shown). However, treatment of the sod1/fet3 double mutant with iron did not improve its respiratory growth. This finding may indicate that Fet4p-mediated (low affinity) iron uptake is not powerful enough to provide enough iron to overcome the respiratory defect in the sod1/fet3 strain. Alternatively, the sod1/fet3 strain may have an even higher iron requirement for respiratory growth than either the sod1and fet3 single mutant. In order to test a more direct indicator of respiration, we measured oxygen consumption in cultures grown in normal and iron-supplemented media (YPG). Under normal iron conditions, oxygen consumption in the sod1 and fet3 mutants was lower than that of wild type, but it reached wild type levels when 0.3 mm iron was included in the medium, suggesting that respiratory function was restored by treatment with iron (TableII).Table IITreatment with iron restores the oxygen consumption of sod1 under respiratory growthStrainO2 consumptionChange with iron addition (S.D.)Normalplus 300 μm ironnmol/min/107 cells%WT36.838.4108 (15)sod121.332.0153 (12)fet321.135.5163 (25)sod1/fet314.313.298 (25)WT (EG103) yeast and mutant derivatives sod1 (EG118),fet3 (JF2424), and sod1/fet3 (JF244) were each inoculated at A 600 0.1 in rich medium containing the non-fermentable carbon source glycerol, with or without 0.3 mm ferric chloride.

Open table in a new tab WT (EG103) yeast and mutant derivatives sod1 (EG118),fet3 (JF2424), and sod1/fet3 (JF244) were each inoculated at A 600 0.1 in rich medium containing the non-fermentable carbon source glycerol, with or without 0.3 mm ferric chloride. After 18 h of incubation, aliquots were collected and the oxygen consumption was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The average increases from two independent experiments, each with duplicate samples, are shown, with standard deviation in parentheses. We also tested the ability of iron to rescue the characteristic aerobic lysine and methionine auxotrophies of sod1 mutants. While addition of iron to SDC medium without methionine did not allowsod1 mutant to grow, addition of iron to SDC medium without lysine did somewhat improve the growth of the mutant (data not shown). This result supports our belief that the lysine defect results from inactivation of the iron-sulfur cluster enzyme homoaconitase, 2L.-L. Liou, V. D. Longo, J. S. Valentine, and E. B. Gralla, submitted for publication. but the effect was not very dramatic and was not pursued further. We examined the growth of our family of strains under aerobic (20% oxygen) and microaerobic conditions (5% oxygen) on YPD plates with normal iron levels (Fig. 2). As expected, low oxygen improved the growth of the sod1 mutant as well as the sod1/fet3 mutant. But, interestingly, thesod1/fet3 mutant was more sensitive to oxygen under either oxygen condition than the sod1 strain. In order to determine whether the intracellular iron content was altered in thesod1 mutant, we analyzed the total iron content in our strains. Fig. 3 shows that intracellular iron contents are similar in sod1 and wild type cells when they were grown in rich glycerol media. As expected, thefet3 mutant strain showed decreased intracellular iron content, since only the low affinity iron transporter can contribute to iron uptake (32.Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 37.Hassett R.F. Romeo A.M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7628-7636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the sod1 mutant and thesod1/fet3 double mutant accumulated the same amount of iron per cell as wild type cells. This finding may reflect an increased iron requirement due to the addition of the sod1 mutation; in the double mutant, and to a lesser extent in the sod1 single mutant, growth may be slowed until sufficient iron accumulates, while the single fet3 mutant, being oxygen resistant, is perhaps able to grow with less total cellular iron. This idea is supported by the growth data shown in Fig. 1; it can be seen that thesod1 and sod1/fet3 strains grew more slowly. When cells were grown in glucose minimal medium (SDC) to late log phase, slightly different results were obtained. In agreement with the idea that the sod1 mutant requires extra iron, Fig.4 A shows that sod1mutant contains more intracellular iron than the wild type strain. Thesod1/fet3 double mutant shows the same amount of intracellular iron as does the sod1 mutant, which supports the idea that the sod1 mutation increases the cellular demand for iron. Most investigators accept that the major source of intracellular superoxide is mitochondrial respiration (2.Valentine J.S. Wertz D.L. Lyons T.J. Liou L.L. Goto J.J. Gralla E.B. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 4.Gralla E.B. Scandalios J. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses.

FEBS Lett. 1983; 155: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Indeed, reduced superoxide production in respiration-incompetent strains, such ascoq3 and atp2 mutants, partially rescues the air-dependent lysine and methionine auxotrophies of thesod1 mutant (7.Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). However, we observed that ansod1/coq3 double mutant still showed increased intracellular iron content as compared with anSOD1 +/coq3 strain (Fig.4 B). This indicated to us that the effect was not caused simply by the cells respiring more and needing more iron for synthesis of respiratory enzymes and cytochromes, but that some other iron-requiring system(s) were involved. It should be noted that the presence of the coq3 mutation in the sod1 strain did not fully restore a wild type phenotype, even though oxygen consumption was severely reduced (7.Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that superoxide is still produced in this strain in sufficient quantities to cause mischief and that the iron accumulation we see is attributable to superoxide-related toxicity. We measured iron levels in anaerobically grown cultures of wild type and sod1 mutant yeast in order to test further the possibility that the accumulation of excess iron is related to oxidative stress. Accumulation of excess iron did not occur in anaerobically grown cultures of sod1 mutant yeast, indicating that this phenotype, like the other characteristics of thesod1 yeast, is related to oxidative stress (data not shown). To test directly whether changes in the expression of the iron transport systems occurred, we analyzed expression of the FET3 andFET4 genes. Results of S1 nuclease protection experiments, shown in Fig. 5 A, indicate that transcripts of the high affinity iron uptake gene,FET3, were increased approximately 2-fold in thesod1 mutant. The level of the FET4 transcript remained unaltered (data not shown). Similar results were obtained using a FET3 promoter-β-galactosidase fusion construct (Fig. 5 B). In the sod1/fet3 double mutant, there was an increase in the expression of the gene for the low affinity iron transporter, FET4 (Fig. 5 C). This result is in agreement with the data presented in Fig. 4 A showing that the sod1/fet3 mutant contains high intracellular iron levels; in this case, we infer that iron is transported by Fet4p. Because of the close interrelationship between oxygen toxicity and the toxicity of redox active metals, we set out to explore the relationship between iron and oxidative damage in yeast lacking CuZnSOD. Iron is thought to exert a toxic effect on cells by catalyzing the formation of hydroxyl radical from hydrogen peroxide via the Fenton reaction (16.Fridovich I. Science. 1978; 201: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar, 17.Meneghini R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In vitro, and possibly in vivoas well, superoxide can be involved in this reaction as the reducing agent for the iron. On the other hand, since superoxide participates in the Fenton reaction mainly as a reducing agent, it is hard to imagine that in the highly reducing conditions that prevail inside the cell, this reaction could be the main cause of superoxide toxicity. Recently, a more likely mechanism has been advanced to explain superoxide-related damage, which better explains our results. Superoxide radical is known to oxidize exposed [4Fe-4S] clusters in certain enzymes, leading to inactivation of the enzyme and “freeing” of iron (15.Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 39.Murakami K. Yoshino M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 41: 481-486PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Flint D.H. Allen R.M. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2315-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). “Free” iron may then become available to participate in Fenton chemistry. For example, it has been shown in E. coli that DNA damage and mutagenesis are attributable to such a process (41.Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). In this model superoxide is directly involved in enzyme inactivation and indirectly, but crucially, involved in oxidative damage, providing not only a possibly redundant reducing agent (superoxide), but also the catalytic “free” iron ion necessary for the Fenton reaction to occur. Thus, if Fenton chemistry was primarily responsible for the phenotype of sod1 yeast, added iron would be expected to be toxic tosod1 mutant yeast. On the other hand, if inactivation of iron-sulfur cluster enzymes was more important in causing the phenotype, we would expect added iron to be beneficial to these strains, which was what we observed. We attribute the rescue of sod1 yeast by excess iron to its ability to meet the increased iron demand by the systems involved in reconstituting [4Fe-4S] cluster prosthetic groups. This conclusion is in accord with recent work, which showed that iron improved growth ofsodA/sodB mutant E. coli by reactivating Fe-S cluster-containing enzymes (42.Benov L. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10313-10316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In our yeast experiments, if iron is present in limited amounts and is used to repair Fe-S clusters, less iron may be available for heme synthesis leading to deficiencies in cytochromes and thus respiratory deficits, as well as decreases in the activities of the specific Fe-S cluster enzymes affected by excess superoxide. These effects may combine to severely diminish growth in glycerol. The best studied enzyme with an exposed [4Fe-4S] cluster is aconitase (40.Flint D.H. Allen R.M. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2315-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), which catalyzes the interconversion of citrate and isocitrate and participates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the matrix of the mitochondria, but it is not the only potential target. Other likely candidates in yeast include homoaconitase, which converts homocitrate to homoisocitrate as part of the lysine biosynthetic pathway and is located in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria,2and 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase, which catalyzes an early step in leucine biosynthesis (40.Flint D.H. Allen R.M. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2315-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although it is not present in yeast, the iron-responsive element binding protein, or cytoplasmic aconitase, of mammalian cells is also a member of this family. Iron deprivation activates a high affinity iron uptake system (23.Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 37.Hassett R.F. Romeo A.M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7628-7636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This induction is mediated by increased transcription of the genes involved, including FET3, via the Aft1 transcription factor (37.Hassett R.F. Romeo A.M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7628-7636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 43.Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We observed that the sod1 mutant showed higher levels of transcription of the FET3 gene (Fig. 5). Since theFET3 gene is induced by iron scarcity, we can infer thatsod1 strain feels iron-deprived. The fact that thesod1 mutant nevertheless showed increased intracellular iron can be explained if the excess intracellular iron is in an inaccessible state, unavailable to the iron sensing and utilization machinery. Such a phenomenon has been reported recently in yfh1 andatm1 mutants in yeast (44.Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 45.Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Although high amounts of iron accumulate in the mitochondria ofyfh1 and atm1 mutants, the cells feel iron-starved and continue to import more iron. Strains carrying either of these mutations spontaneously go rho −(i.e. lose their mitochondrial DNA and become unable to respire) at a very high rate (44.Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 46.Leighton J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This loss was attributed to elevated oxidative damage due to the presence of excess iron in the mitochondria (44.Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 45.Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In subsequent work, these proteins were shown to be involved in iron export from the mitochondria (47.Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 48.Lill R. Diekert K. Kaut A. Lange H. Pelzer W. Prohl C. Kispal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1157-1166Google Scholar). In thesod1 mutant strain there is no obvious increase in the rate of rho − formation, or indeed of any kind of petite formation, so the iron that accumulates in this mutant is probably not in mitochondria, or (less likely) it is in an unreactive form. Recently, other workers have shown altered vacuolar morphology in sod1 mutants and suggested that iron may play a role in this phenomenon (36.Corson L.B. Folmer J. Strain J.J. Culotta V.C. Cleveland D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27590-27596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the vacuole is another potential, perhaps more likely, location for the excess iron in oursod1 strains. It will be, of course, of great interest to determine where the excess iron is located in sod1 mutants, and we are currently proceeding in this direction. Inactivation of the FET3 gene increased the severity of thesod1 phenotype (Figs. 1 and 2). In our experiments, both thesod1 and the sod1/fet3 mutant required increased iron (Figs. 1, 2, and 4 A). However, the sod1/fet3double knockout was more sensitive to oxygen than sod1 (Fig.2). Recently it was shown that, in fet3 mutants, transcription of a low affinity iron transporter gene, FET4,was increased (32.Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fet4p is a less specific metal ion transporter, transporting copper, cadmium, and cobalt as well as iron (22.Dix D. Bridgham J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11770-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thesod1/fet3 cell line showed an increase in FET4transcription (Fig. 5 C), but similar intracellular iron content compared with the sod1 mutant. The severity of the phenotype of the sod1/fet3 strain may reflect the reduced ability of the FET4 pathway to keep up with thesod1-induced iron demand, or it may reflect toxicity due to increased levels of other metal ions brought in by the less specificFET4 pathway. Overall, we have observed an increased iron requirement insod1 mutants and a beneficial effect of iron treatment on these cells. The fact remains, however, that excess iron could very well have simultaneous beneficial and harmful effects. The phenotype we observed in the sod1 mutants likely reflects a tension between harmful and beneficial effects of iron that in these experiments tended toward the beneficial. This dichotomy may explain why the phenotype we observed was not stronger, and it is another example of the basic principle that biology is a balancing act.

In contrast, transcription of the 5′ genes (i.e. HOX9-13) is invariant in CD34+ cells, and decreases in mature phagocytes (3.Sauvageau G. Lansdorp P.M. Eaves C.J. Hogge D.E. Dragowska W.H. Reid D.S. Largman C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12223-12227Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In comparison with normal, mature myeloid cells, expression ofHOXA10 is increased in acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, or myelodysplasia (4.Lawrence H.J. Sauvageau G. Ahmadi N. Lopez A.R. Le Beau M.M. Link M. Humphries K. Largman C. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 1160-1166PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, overexpression of HoxA10 in murine bone marrow induces a myeloproliferative disorder, which evolves to acute leukemia (5.Thorsteinsdottir U. Sauvageau G. Hough M.R. Dragowska W. Lansdorp P.M. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Humphries R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 17: 495-505Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These results suggest that HoxA10 is involved in progression of myeloid differentiation. Although the most abundant HoxA10 transcript in human myeloid cells encodes a 406-amino acid protein (predicted molecular mass of 50 kDa) (6.Lowney P. Corral J. Detmer K. Le Beau M.M. Deaven L. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3443-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), alternatively spliced transcripts have been described at various stages of murine embryogenesis (7.Benson G.V. Nguyen T.-H.E. Maas R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in transformed cell lines (4.Lawrence H.J. Sauvageau G. Ahmadi N. Lopez A.R. Le Beau M.M. Link M. Humphries K. Largman C. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 1160-1166PubMed Google Scholar). In myeloid leukemia cell lines, a HoxA10 transcript is present encoding a protein that initiates 20 amino acids N-terminal to the homeodomain (6.Lowney P. Corral J. Detmer K. Le Beau M.M. Deaven L. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3443-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that the 80-amino acid (15-kDa) “short A10” may contribute to immortalization of myeloid cell lines, although the role of short A10 in normal myelopoiesis is unknown. Similar to the other Abd-like Hox proteins (Hox9–13), DNA binding affinity of HoxA10 is increased by partnering with Pbx proteins (8.Chang C.-P. Brocchieri L Shen W.-F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Although consensus sequences for Pbx-HoxA10 binding have been derived (8.Chang C.-P. Brocchieri L Shen W.-F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 9.Shen W.-F. Rosenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8198-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 10.Neuteboon S.T.C. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4696-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), genuine Pbx-HoxA10 target genes have not been identified. It has been hypothesized that HoxA10 regulates myeloid differentiation by activating transcription of genes that are necessary for progression of myelopoiesis. Conversely, HoxA10 might repress transcription of genes characteristic of differentiated myeloid cells, or HoxA10 might activate transcription at one stage of myelopoiesis and repress transcription at another, as has been described for homologousDrosophila proteins, during embryogenesis (11.Pinsonneault J. Florence B. Vaessin H. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2032-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We have been studying regulation of genes encoding the respiratory burst oxidase proteins, gp91 phox (the CYBB gene) (12.Royer-Pokora B. Kunkel L.M. Monaco A.P. Goff S.C. Newburger P.E. Baehner R.L. Cole F.S. Curnutte J.T. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1986; 322: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) and p67 phox (the NCF2 gene) (13.Leto T.L. Lomax K.J. Volpp B.D. Nunio H. Sechler J.M.G. Nauseef W.M. Clark R. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Science. 1990; 248: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These genes are transcribed in cells differentiated beyond the promyelocyte stage and therefore provide a model for gene regulation during late myelopoiesis. Both the CYBB and NCF2 genes contain sequences similar to the Pbx-HoxA10 binding consensus sequence. One of these CYBB sequences is within a previously described repressor element (14.Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which binds the CCAAT displacement protein (CDP)1 in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with HeLa or K562 nuclear proteins (14.Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15.Neufeld E.J. Skalnik D.G. Lievens P.M.-J. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In NIH 3T3 cells, overexpression of CDP represses an artificial promoter construct containing the CYBB element (16.Lievens P.M.J. Donady J.J. Tufarelli C. Neufeld E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12745-12750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, our previous investigations demonstrated that CDP is not a component of the complex binding to the CYBB repressor element in EMSA with nuclear proteins from the myeloid lines PLB985 and U937 (17.Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9344-9355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Since HoxA10 mRNA is present in these myeloid cell lines, but not in HeLa or K562 cells (4.Lawrence H.J. Sauvageau G. Ahmadi N. Lopez A.R. Le Beau M.M. Link M. Humphries K. Largman C. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 1160-1166PubMed Google Scholar), our current studies investigate the hypothesis that, in committed myeloid progenitors, HoxA10 interacts with repressor elements and suppresses transcription of some myeloid-specific genes until later stages of myelopoiesis. Previously, we demonstrated that IFN-γ-induced myeloid differentiation decreases in vitro protein binding to theCYBB repressor element, coincident with increasedCYBB transcription (17.Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9344-9355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also investigate the effect of IFN-γ-induced differentiation on HoxA10 DNA binding and functional activity in myeloid cells. Artificial promoter/reporter constructs were generated as described previously (18.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), in the minimal promoter/reporter vector, p-TATACAT (19.Scholer H.R. Balling R. Hazopoulos A.K. Suzuki N. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2551-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) (obtained from Dr. A. Kraft, University of Colorado, Denver). Constructs were generated with three copies (in the forward orientation) of the consensus sequence for HoxA10-Pbx binding (p-a10TATACAT) (8.Chang C.-P. Brocchieri L Shen W.-F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) or four copies (in the forward direction) the −94 to −134 bp sequence from the CYBBpromoter (p-cybba10TATACAT). This CYBB promoter sequence has previously been demonstrated to function as a repressor element in myeloid cell lines (16.Lievens P.M.J. Donady J.J. Tufarelli C. Neufeld E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12745-12750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An artificial promoter construct with five copies of the Gal4 DNA binding site and a minimal promoter from the thymidine kinase gene linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter (p-gal4TKCAT) was obtained from T. Gabig (Indiana University, Indianapolis). The cDNAs for human HoxA10 and “short A10” were obtained from C. Largman (University of California, San Francisco) and subcloned in to the mammalian expression vector pSRα (20.Takebe, Y., Seki, M., Fujisajwa, J.-I. Hoy, P., Yokota, K., Arai, K.-I., Yoshida, M., and Arai, N. (1988) Mol. Cell. Biol.Google Scholar). The human Pbx1 cDNA and a FLAG epitope-tagged HoxA10 cDNA were obtained from M. Cleary (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) (8.Chang C.-P. Brocchieri L Shen W.-F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and also subcloned into the pSRα vector. The cDNAs for HoxA10 and “short A10” were also subcloned into the vector pM2(GAL4), for expression as a fusion protein with the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (21.Sadowski I. Ma J. Trieznberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Core Facility of the Comprehensive Cancer Center (University of Alabama, Birmingham) or the Riley Pediatric Research Center (Indiana University, Indianapolis). Oligonucleotides used were as follows: derived consensus sequence for Pbx-HoxA10 binding (dsA10), 5′-tgcgatgat ttatgaccgc-3′; the similar sequence from the CYBB promoter (−94 to −134 bp) (dscybbA10) (14.Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 5′-ttcagttgaccaat gat tattagccaattttctgataaaa-3′; a mutant sequence from the CYBB promoter (−94 to −134 bp) (dscybbmut), 5′-ttcagttgaccaat gattcggcgccaatttctgataaaa-3′; the similar sequence from the NCF2 gene (−600 to −637 bp) (dsncf2A10), 5′-aaaaggcattagtcaagagataat taattgggaaagag-3′; a mutant sequence from the NCF2 gene (−600 to −637 bp) (dsncf2A10mut), 5′-aaaaggcattagtcaagagataat gccgtgggaaagag-3′; an irrelevant sequence from the NCF2 gene (−535 to −575 bp) (dsncf2irf), 5′-cactctaggtcacgggtttcatttgggaccactagcctagt-3′; anotherCYBB promoter sequence similar to the Pbx-HoxA10 binding consensus sequence (−194 to −242 bp) (dscybb5′A10), 5′-agaaattggtttcattttccact atgtt taattgtgactggatcatta-3′; the CCAAT box from the α-globin gene (urccaat) (22.Dorn A. Bollenkens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), 5′-ccgggctccgcgccagccaatgagcgccgcgg-3′. In these oligonucleotides, the HoxA10 core (or mutated core) is in boldface type, the Pbx core is in italics, and ccaat boxes are underlined. All cell lines were of human origin. The promyelocytic leukemia cell line PLB985 was obtained from Thomas Rado (University of Alabama, Birmingham). The myelomonocytic cell line U937 (23.Larrick J.W. Anderson S.J. Koren H.S. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 6-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Andrew Kraft (University of Colorado, Denver). Cell lines were maintained and differentiated as described (17.Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9344-9355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). U937 cells were treated with 200 units/ml human recombinant IFN-γ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Nuclear extract proteins were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (24.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 11: 1475-1479Crossref Scopus (9164) Google Scholar), with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, as described (18.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides probes were prepared, and EMSA and antibody supershift assays were performed as described (18.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Antiserum to HoxA10 (not cross-reactive with other Hox proteins) was obtained from Covance Research Products (Richmond, CA). Pbx antibodies (C-20 and P-20), blocking peptides, and an antibody to CDP were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised to whole CDP protein (purified from HeLa cells) was a generous gift of Ellis Neufeld (Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA). In vitro transcribed HoxA10, short A10, and Pbx1 mRNA were generated from linearized template DNA, using the Riboprobe System, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). In vitro translated proteins were generated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Control (unprogrammed) lysates were generated in similar reactions in the absence of input RNA.In vitro translated proteins and nuclear proteins were tyrosine-dephosphorylated with Yop protein-tyrosine phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Proteins (either 10 μl of in vitro translated protein or 2 μg of nuclear proteins) were incubated 30 min at 30 °C, in a 20-μl reaction volume with 50 units of Yop and 1× reaction buffer, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control proteins were incubated, similarly, in 1× reaction buffer withoutYop. EMSA with the in vitro translated proteins was performed as described (18.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Binding assays with in vitro translated proteins and the dscybbA10 oligonucleotide were performed in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of the urccaat oligonucleotide. The urccaat oligonucleotide competes for binding of CP1, found in reticulocyte lysate, to the dscybbA10 probe. Cells were transfected by electroporation as described (18.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). U937 cells (32 × 106/sample) were transfected with 70 μg of p-TATACAT, p-a10TATACAT, or p-cybba10TATACAT; 30 μg of pSRα, HoxA10/pSRα, shortA10/pSRα, or Pbx1/pSRα or 15 μg each of HoxA10/pSRα plus Pbx1/pSRα; and 15 μg of p-CMVβ-gal (to normalize for transfection efficiency). In other experiments, U937 cells were transfected with 20 or 2 μg of p-gal4TKCAT; 20 μg of HoxA10/pm2(GAL4), shortA10/pm2GAL4, or control pM2GAL4; and 15 μg of p-CMVβ-gal. Transfectants were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, followed by 24 h with or without IFN-γ (200 units/ml). Preparation of cell extracts, β-galactosidase, and CAT assays were performed as described (25.Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 26.Sambrook H. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In other experiments, U937 cells were transfected with 30 μg of pSRα, HoxA10/pSRα, or HoxA10(FLAG)/pSRα. The cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and harvested for extraction of nuclear proteins or total cellular RNA. Western blots were performed with 30 μg of nuclear proteins extracted from U937 cells, with or without 48 h IFN-γ incubation. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with HoxA10 antiserum (Covance Research Products) or control rabbit pre-immune serum, and proteins were detected by chemiluminescence, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In other experiments, Western blots of nuclear proteins from U937 cells transiently transfected with pSRα or FLAG epitope-tagged HoxA10/pSRα were performed with anti-FLAG antibody. To determine HoxA10 phosphorylation state, U937 cells, with or without 48 h of IFN-γ differentiation, were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with 32P-orthophosphate, as described (27.Brugge J.S. Erickson R.L. Nature. 1977; 269: 346-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed, under denaturing conditions, and proteins were immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 °C, with 2 μl of HoxA10 antiserum or 2 μl of control rabbit preimmune serum, followed by a 1-h incubation with 30 μl of 50% staph protein A-Sepharose bead slurry, as described (27.Brugge J.S. Erickson R.L. Nature. 1977; 269: 346-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer, eluted in SDS sample buffer, and identified by autoradiography of 12% SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation experiments were also performed with 100 μg of nuclear proteins extracted from U937 cells, with or without 48-h IFN-γ incubation. Nuclear proteins were diluted into radioimmune precipitation buffer, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, as described (28.Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3059-3065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and incubated with either 1 μl of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or irrelevant antibody (mouse anti-rabbit IgG), for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by a 1-h incubation with 15 μl of 50% staph protein A-Sepharose bead slurry. Beads were washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with HoxA10 antibody (Covance Research Products) or control rabbit preimmune serum. Similar experiments were performed to determine tyrosine phosphorylation of in vitro translated HoxA10. In vitro translated proteins (10 μl), with or withoutYop treatment, and control lysate were diluted into radioimmune precipitation buffer and immunoprecipitated as described above. The proteins were detected by autoradiography of SDS-PAGE. Total cellular RNA was extracted from U937 cells, as described (17.Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9344-9355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), 48 h after transfection with HoxA10/pSRα, FLAG epitope-tagged HoxA10/pSRα, or control pSRα. Northern blots were performed with 20 μg of total cellular RNA, as described (17.Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9344-9355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Probes for Northern blots were generated by random primer labeling of cDNAs encoding human gp91 phox, p67 phox and chicken γ-actin, as described (17.Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9344-9355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence for HoxA10 binding to DNA as a heterodimer with Pbx1 (8.Chang C.-P. Brocchieri L Shen W.-F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) consists of a Pbx1 site adjacent to a HoxA10 site: 5′-ATGAT TTATGA-3′ (HoxA10 site in boldface type, the Pbx site in italics) (9.Shen W.-F. Rosenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8198-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Inspection of the promoter regions of the genes encoding gp91 phox (the CYBBgene) and p67 phox (the NCF2 gene) identified sequences similar to the Pbx-HoxA10 consensus (Fig.1 A). The CYBBsequence includes the core sequence preferred in HoxA10 binding site selection experiments (TTAT) and the Pbx consensus (7.Benson G.V. Nguyen T.-H.E. Maas R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike sequences identified by binding site selection, there was overlap of the Pbx and Hox binding cores. The NCF2 sequence includes an alternative HoxA10 core, identified by binding site selection (TAAT) (7.Benson G.V. Nguyen T.-H.E. Maas R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a Pbx consensus, altered at position 3. The Pbx-HoxA10-like sequence in the CYBB promoter is within a 30-bp region previously demonstrated to function as a repressor element in undifferentiated cells (16.Lievens P.M.J. Donady J.J. Tufarelli C. Neufeld E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12745-12750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In EMSA with nuclear proteins from the promyelocytic leukemia cell line PLB985, an unidentified, specific protein complex interacts with this CYBB repressor element (referred to as complex A) (14.Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Neufeld E.J. Skalnik D.G. Lievens P.M.-J. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that IFN-γ-induced differentiation of PLB985 cells abolishes in vitro binding of complex A to the repressor element, coincident with an increase in CYBB transcription (17.Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9344-9355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that HoxA10 is a component of complex A binding theCYBB repressor element and that myeloid differentiation decreases HoxA10 DNA binding. To pursue this hypothesis, we investigated whether in vitro protein binding to the derived Pbx-HoxA10 consensus sequence decreases during IFN-γ-induced myeloid differentiation. In these experiments, we used U937 cells, a monocyte-committed cell line that expresses HoxA10 mRNA (4.Lawrence H.J. Sauvageau G. Ahmadi N. Lopez A.R. Le Beau M.M. Link M. Humphries K. Largman C. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 1160-1166PubMed Google Scholar). IFN-γ treatment of U937 cells results in monocyte differentiation and increased CYBB and NCF2 transcription (17.Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9344-9355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed, using nuclear proteins from U937 cells and a radiolabeled probe with the derived consensus sequence for Pbx-HoxA10 binding (referred to as dsA10 oligonucleotide) (Fig. 1 B). A complex binds to dsA10 that is of similar mobility to complex A generated by U937 nuclear proteins and the homologous CYBBsequence (the dscybbA10 oligonucleotide). Binding of this complex to the dsA10 probe (referred to as complex A1) is competed for by excess, unlabeled, homologous oligonucleotide and by oligonucleotides with the similar sequences from the CYBBand NCF2 genes (the dsncf2A10 oligonucleotide) but not by several dissimilar oligonucleotides (Fig. 1 B). Binding of both complex A1 to the dsA10 probe and of A to the dscybbA10 probe is decreased in EMSA with nuclear proteins from IFN-γ-treated U937 cells, in comparison with nuclear proteins from undifferentiated cells (Fig. 1, B and C). These results are consistent with our previous data with nuclear proteins from PLB985 cells and the dscybbA10 probe (17.Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9344-9355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In EMSA with U937 nuclear proteins, binding of the A complex to the dscybbA10 probe was competed for by homologous oligonucleotide and the dsncf2A10 and dsA10 oligonucleotides, but not by unrelated oligonucleotides or by dscybbA10 or dsncf2A10 oligonucleotides with mutations in the TTAT or TAAT sequences (Fig. 1 D). However, there are differences in the complexes shifted by the dsA10 and dscybbA10 probes. Binding of complex A1 to the dsA10 probe is of lower affinity than complex A binding to the dscybbA10 probe (in terms of pmol of shifted probe/μg of nuclear proteins; Fig.1, compare B and C). Also, the dsA10 probe binds several higher mobility protein complexes, in addition to A1, which are competed for by homologous oligonucleotide or dscybbA10 but not dsncf2A10 (Fig. 1 B). These higher mobility complexes may represent proteins encoded by alternatively spliced HoxA10 transcripts (6.Lowney P. Corral J. Detmer K. Le Beau M.M. Deaven L. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3443-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7.Benson G.V. Nguyen T.-H.E. Maas R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, these complexes may represent proteolytic fragments of HoxA10, although U937 nuclear proteins used in these experiments were tested for integrity in other EMSAs with characterized binding sites. To determine if HoxA10 is a component of either complex A1binding to the dsA10 probe or complex A binding to the dscybbA10 probe, we used an antibody raised to the HoxA10 C terminus that does not recognize other Hox proteins. In preliminary experiments, we determined that this antibody does not recognize recombinant CDP (data not shown). In EMSA with the dsA10 probe and nuclear proteins from U937 cells, binding of complex A1 is disrupted by HoxA10 antibody but not preimmune serum (Fig. 2 A). Antibody to HoxA10 also disrupts binding of complex A to the dscybbA10 probe (Fig. 2 B). Identical results were obtained with nuclear proteins from PLB985 cells (not shown). In addition, HoxA10 antibody disrupts two high mobility complexes binding the dsA10 probe, suggesting that they contain the HoxA10 C terminus, consistent with previously described, alternatively spliced messages (6.Lowney P. Corral J. Detmer K. Le Beau M.M. Deaven L. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3443-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7.Benson G.V. Nguyen T.-H.E. Maas R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the dscybbA10 probe does not bind high mobility species, cross-immunoreactive with HoxA10. EMSAs were also performed to determine if Pbx1 is a component of either complex A1 (binding to dsA10) or complex A (binding to dscybbA10). EMSAs were performed with U937 nuclear proteins and Pbx antibodies, with or without blocking peptides. In EMSA with an antibody to a peptide in the N terminus of Pbx1, inconsistent disruption of both complexes A and A1 is demonstrated (not shown). However, in EMSA with an antibody to a peptide in the Pbx C terminus, binding of complex A1 to the dsA10 probe and of complex A to the dscybbA10 probe is disrupted (Fig. 1, C and D). However, these results do not exclude the possibility that additional, unidentified proteins bind to dsA10 or dscybbA10 and participate in these complexes. C"

Cyclooxygenase-2- and the xenobiotic-metabolizing cytochrome P450s 1A and 3A are all aberrantly expressed during colorectal carcinogenesis. To probe for a role of P450s in prostaglandin endoperoxide metabolism, we studied the 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoate (HHT)/malondialdehyde (MDA) synthase activity of human liver microsomes and purified P450s. We found that human liver microsomes have HHT/MDA synthase activity that is concentration-dependent and inhibited by the P450 inhibitors, ketoconazole and clotrimazole with IC50values of 1 and 0.4 μm, respectively. This activity does not require P450 reductase. HHT/MDA synthase activity was present in purified P450s but not in heme alone or other heme proteins. The catalytic activities of various purified P450s were determined by measuring rates of MDA production from prostaglandin endoperoxide. At 50 μm substrate, the catalytic activities of purified human P450s varied from 10 ± 1 to 0.62 ± 0.02 min−1, 3A4 ≫ 2E1 > 1A2. Oxabicycloheptane analogs of prostaglandin endoperoxide, U-44069 and U-46619, induced spectral changes in human P450 3A4 with K s values of 240 ± 20 and 130 ± 10 μm, respectively. These results suggest that co-expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and P450s in developing cancers may contribute to genomic instability due to production of the endogenous mutagen, MDA.

PGG2 is reduced by the peroxidase activity of the enzyme to PGH2, which is subsequently metabolized to biologically active eicosanoids (prostaglandins and thromboxane). Excessive prostanoid biosynthesis has been strongly implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis (1.Bennett A. Tacca M.D. Stamford I.F. Zebro T. Br. J.

The inducible form of the enzyme, COX-2, is expressed early in colon carcinogenesis and is detectable in ∼85% of colon carcinomas (10.Eberhart C.E. Coffey R.J. Radhika A. Giardiello F.M.

The mechanisms by which COX-2 expression could contribute to colon cancer progression is uncertain but include enhancement of cell proliferation, reduction in cell death (apoptosis), or induction of mutations leading to malignancy. We are investigating the possibility that COX-2 expression leads to increased DNA damage and mutation. The likely mediator of DNA damage is malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of the breakdown of PGH2(Fig. 1). MDA is carcinogenic in rats, mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cells, and reacts with DNA to form adducts with guanine, adenine, and cytosine (13.Spalding J.W. Natl. Toxicol.

The breakdown of PGH2 to hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) and MDA occurs spontaneously or can be catalyzed by ferrous ion or heme (Fig. 1) (21.Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3400-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 22.Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several enzymes have been found to have an auxiliary “HHT/MDA synthase” activity. Thromboxane synthase converts PGH2 to thromboxane A2, HHT, and MDA in a 1:1:1 ratio (22.Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Diczfalusy U. Falardeau P. Hammarstrom S.

Prostacyclin synthase converts PGH2 to prostacyclin but produces exclusively MDA and the C17 hydroxy acid from PGH1, a metabolite of eicosatrienoic acid (22.Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol.

Prostaglandin Thromboxane Res. 1980; 6: 27-34PubMed Google Scholar). Both thromboxane synthase (CYP5) and prostacyclin synthase (CYP8) belong to the cytochrome P450 superfamily (also termed heme-thiolate protein P450 by the Enzyme Commission, EC 1.14.14.1), which suggests that such a reaction may be general to other cytochromes P450. Hecker and Ullrich (22.Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that both prokaryotic P450CAM fromPseudomonas putida and rat liver microsomes convert PGH2 to primarily HHT, but other mammalian P450s have not been studied. It is increasingly recognized that expression of xenobiotic- metabolizing P450s is a characteristic of extrahepatic malignancies (26.Taylor M.C. McKay J.A. Murray G.I. Greenlee W.F. Marcus C.B.

Just as COX-2 is overexpressed in both colorectal adenomas and carcinomas, P450 1A and 3A are both are overexpressed in human colonic adenomas and carcinomas as determined by immunohistochemistry (37.McKay J.A.

In addition, it has been found that chronic alcohol consumption, a known risk factor for colorectal cancer, induces P450s 2E1 and 2C7 in the colon of rats (38.Hakkak R. Korourian S. Ronis M.J. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Badger T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Finally, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a co-inducer of P450 1A1 and COX-2 (39.Kim P.M. DeBoni U. Wells P.G. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1997; 23: 579-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), has been shown to shift the prostaglandin profile to increased HHT in wild type Hepa-1 cells but not in a cell line with mutant P450 1A1 (40.Puga A. Hoffer A. Zhou S. Bohm J.M. Leikauf G.D. Shertzer H.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Given the co-expression of COX-2- and xenobiotic-metabolizing P450s in human colon cancers, we studied the ability of several well characterized P450s to convert PGH2 to HHT and the known endogenous mutagen, MDA. We find that a wide variety of P450s from different species are efficient HHT/MDA synthases when PGH2is the substrate. These findings suggest new roles for COX-2 and P450s as co-conspirators in compromising genome integrity by accelerating DNA damage via MDA. Triphenylphosphine, sodium dithionite, and pyridine were purchased from Aldrich. Beef liver catalase was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

Briefly, microsomes were isolated from 30–40 g of ram seminal vesicles (Oxford Biomedical Research, Inc., Oxford, MI) and stored at −80 °C until use. Microsomes were resuspended in 15 ml of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, mixed with 85 ml of oxygen-saturated Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 500 μm phenol, and incubated at 25 °C. After 2 min, 10–20 mg of arachidonic acid (20 mg) (Nu Chek Prep, Elysian, MN) containing a tracer amount (0.5 Ci/mol) of [1-14C]arachidonic acid (NEN Life Science Products) dissolved in 0.5 ml of ethanol was added. After 2 min, 350 μl of 6n HCl was added and rapidly extracted twice with diethyl ether chilled to 4 °C. The combined ether layers were dried over 10 g of MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in hexane/diethyl ether (80:20) and purified by activated silicic acid chromatography (60–200 mesh). Fractions were pooled, evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, and stored in dry acetone or acetonitrile at −20 °C. PGH2 preparations were routinely 85–90% pure as characterized by TLC (described below), and the material that co-eluted with PGH2 could be completely converted to PGF2α by 40 mm triphenylphosphine. Human liver microsomes were prepared as described by Guengerich (43.Guengerich F.P. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. 3rd Ed.

Heme concentrations were determined by the pyridine hemochrome assay using εΔ(556–540) = 20.7 mm−1·cm−1 (50.Falk J.E. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins: Their General, Physical and Coordination Chemistry, and Laboratory Methods. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1964Google Scholar, 51.Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). P450 concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm following dithionite reduction in the presence of carbon monoxide (52.Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme or hemin solutions were prepared in 450 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. For inhibition experiments, clotrimazole or ketoconazole was added in 4.5 μl of ethanol to human liver microsomes (0.7 μm P450) in 450 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and preincubated for 5 min at room temperature. [1-14C]PGH2 (50 μm) was added in 9 μl of acetone and incubated at room temperature for 3 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of 400 μl of 40 mmtriphenylphosphine in diethyl ether, methanol, 1 m citric acid (80:12:2.8, v/v). The organic phase was spotted on silica gel thin layer plates (J. T. Baker Inc.) and developed with water-saturated ethyl acetate/isooctane/glacial acetic acid (90:50:20, v/v/v). Radiolabeled products were quantitated with a radioactivity scanner (Bioscan, Inc. Washington, D. C.). Rabbit P450 1A2 (1 μm) and PGH2 (84 μm) were incubated in 450 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 3 min, and the products were extracted and reduced with triphenylphosphine as described above. The organic layer was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and redissolved in 50 μl of methanol for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry studies and 100 μl of water/methanol/glacial acetic acid (50:50:1, v/v/v) for direct flow injection/tandem mass spectrometry. High performance liquid chromatography/negative ion electrospray ionization/selected ion monitoring-mass spectrometry conditions were as follows: 5-μl injections, 150 × 2.1 mm inner diameter, 5-μm Zorbax® C8 column (Hewlett-Packard); solvent A, nanopure water; solvent B, acetonitrile; flow rate, 0.2 ml/min; linear gradient from 40% solvent B to 65% solvent B in 15 min; Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source operated in the negative ion mode with nitrogen sheath gas (70 pounds/square inch); spray voltage, 3.5 kV; capillary temperature, 200 °C; capillary voltage, 20.3 V; scan time 1.5 s. Selected ion monitoring of four m/z channels were used to monitor HHT (m/z = 279), PGB2(m/z = 333), PGE2 and PGD2(m/z = 351), and PGF2α(m/z = 353). For negative ion electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry, the sample was introduced by direct flow injection at 30 μl/min into the electrospray ionization source. The collision gas in the second quadrupole was argon (Liquid Air, Walnut Creek, CA) at 2.6 millitorr with a collision energy of 18 eV. The daughter fragment ions ofm/z 279 were analyzed by the third quadrupole with scan time of 1.5 s for 1 min. Purified P450s in 200 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4 (or 300 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4 for CYP1A2 and CYP2E1), were incubated at 25 °C with 50 μm PGH2 added in 4.5 μl of acetonitrile. MDA formation over time was measured by absorbance at 268 nm using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer (53.Hecker M. Haurand M. Ullrich V. Diczfalusy U. Hammarstrom S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 124-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Initial rates were determined by linear fitting of the first 10–20 s. Activities were determined from the slope of a linear fit to triplicate measurement of initial rates at four different P450 concentrations. For boiled controls, enzyme solutions were heated for 10 min at 100 °C and then equilibrated to 25 °C before addition of PGH2. An OLIS DW-2 split beam UV-visible spectrophotometer (Aminco) was blanked with 150 μl of 2 μm P450 in 300 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in both reference and sample quartz microcuvettes. U-44069 or U-46619 from a stock of 6 mg/ml in 10 mmNa2CO3 was added to the sample cuvette, and an equal volume of 10 mm Na2CO3 was added to the reference cuvette. The difference spectrum was recorded between 350 and 500 nm. Relative binding at each concentration of ligand was calculated by subtracting minima from maxima, and spectral dissociation constants (K s) were calculated with Prism 2.0b software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). In order to study the conversion of PGH2to HHT and MDA, a radiometric thin layer chromatography assay was devised. Radiolabeled PGH2 was prepared biosynthetically from incubation of [1-14C]arachidonic acid with ram seminal vesicle microsomes according to published procedures (21.Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3400-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 41.Hamberg M. Svensson J. Wakabayashi T. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PGH2 preparations were routinely 85–90% radiochemically pure as determined by TLC (Fig.2 a). PGH2 is unstable in aqueous solution and during workup. This instability could complicate interpretation of experiments because any unreacted PGH2 could artifactually generate HHT after incubation with enzymes but before analysis by TLC. Therefore, we terminated incubations by organic extraction with solvent containing a small amount of the mild reducing agent, triphenylphosphine. This reagent reduces any unreacted PGH2 to the more stable PGF2α without affecting HHT, PGE2, or PGD2. Thus, HHT could only arise during incubation with enzymes as illustrated in Fig. 2. An additional advantage of using triphenylphosphine is that it converts the non-polar PGH2to the more polar PGF2α avoiding co-migration with the relatively non-polar HHT. Under our assay conditions, PGH2decomposed slightly in buffer alone but was almost entirely converted to a non-polar metabolite by human liver microsomes that we suspected to be HHT (Fig. 2, b and c). The polar product in Fig. 2 c co-migrated with a PGE2 standard. The TLC assay was used to characterize the HHT/MDA synthase activity of human liver microsomes. The percentage of radiolabled PGH2 that was converted to HHT following incubation with varying amounts of human liver microsomes is plotted in Fig.3 a. Human liver microsomes clearly stimulate conversion of PGH2 to HHT in a dose-dependent manner. To test whether it was a P450 component of the liver microsomes responsible for this activity, varying concentrations of P450 inhibitors were preincubated with the microsomes. Because these human liver microsomes are known to contain a high amount of P450 3A4, we used the imidazole antimycotic P450 inhibitors ketoconazole and clotrimazole which are both potent inhibitors of P450 3A4 (54.Gibbs M.A. Kunze K.L. Howald W.N. Thummel K.E. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1999; 27: 596-599PubMed Google Scholar). Both prevented microsomal conversion of PGH2 to HHT with IC50 values of 1 and 0.4 μm, respectively (Fig. 3 b). The fact that these IC50 values are higher than reportedK i values can be readily explained by inhibitor depletion by the relatively high enzyme concentrations used in these assays (54.Gibbs M.A. Kunze K.L. Howald W.N. Thummel K.E. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1999; 27: 596-599PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the P450 component of the microsomes is sufficient for HHT/MDA synthase activity, we expressed recombinant human P450 3A4 in E. coli and assayed an equivalent amount of total heme of the isolated membranes for HHT production (Fig.4). At the same total heme concentration (1 μm), P450 3A4 expressing bacterial membranes converted PGH2 to HHT nearly as well as human liver microsomes. Likewise, human P450 3A4 (1 μm) purified from the bacterial membranes efficiently produced HHT (Fig. 4). Purified human P450 2E1 and rabbit P450 1A2 also converted PGH2 to HHT in the TLC assay (data not shown). Consistent with the findings of Hecker and co-workers (22.Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53.Hecker M. Haurand M. Ullrich V. Diczfalusy U. Hammarstrom S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 124-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), hemin alone produced a statistically significant increase above buffer (p = 0.012), but the same heme concentration of human liver microsomes produced 15-fold more HHT. Other heme proteins, namely cytochrome b 5, catalase, and hemoglobin did not convert PGH2 to HHT beyond what was observed with an equivalent concentration of hemin alone (Fig.4). Therefore, the conversion of PGH2 to HHT and MDA is dependent on heme in the context of the P450 protein. To characterize structurally the reaction products in a cleaner system, PGH2 was incubated with purified rabbit P450 1A2. The extracted products were analyzed by liquid chromatography/negative electrosprayl selected ion monitoring mass spectrometry (Fig. 5). Products consistent with M − H+ ions of PGD2, PGE2 (m/z = 351), and PGF2α(m/z = 353) were observed at retention times similar to those of authentic standards. A nonpolar product was observed atm/z = 279, consistent with the mass of HHT (M − H+). The daughter ions of m/z = 279 corresponding to losses of water (m/z = 261), carboxylate and water (m/z = 217), and hexanal (m/z = 179), are consistent with 12-HHT as the parent ion (Fig. 5, inset). Finally, spectral analysis of incubation mixtures containing PGH2 and rabbit P450 1A2 indicated the formation of a product with absorbance maxima at 234 and 268 nm (data not shown). These absorbance maxima are due to the conjugated diene of HHT and the enolate of MDA, respectively. These results indicated that microsomal P450 and purified P450 3A4 could convert PGH2 to HHT and MDA. To explore the enzyme specificity of this conversion, several purified P450s were incubated with PGH2. We developed a spectrophotometric assay by monitoring the appearance of MDA at 267 nm that enabled us to observe continuously the conversion of PGH2 to HHT and MDA (Fig.6) (53.Hecker M. Haurand M. Ullrich V. Diczfalusy U. Hammarstrom S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 124-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Reactions were conducted at 50 μm PGH2. There was wide variation in the HHT/MDA synthase activity of different human P450s (TableI). The activity of human P450 3A4 was about 10-fold greater than human P450 2E1, which in turn was 70% greater than human P450 1A2. There was also considerable interspecies variation in catalytic activities of P450 1A2 homologs (rabbit > rat > human). Boiling enzyme solutions prior to incubation decreased HHT/MDA synthase activity 5-fold, indicating that intact protein structure is required (data not shown).Table IHHT/MDA synthase activity of P450sP450HHT/MDA synthase activityaDetermined by measuring initial rates of MDA formation as determined by absorbance at 268 nm using varying enzyme concentrations and 50 μm PGH2.min −1Rabbit P450 1A211 ± 1Human P450 3A410 ± 1Rat P450 2B11.0 ± 0.1Human P450 1A20.62 ± 0.02Rat P450 1A25.5 ± 0.5Human P450 2E11.0 ± 0.1a Determined by measuring initial rates of MDA formation as determined by absorbance at 268 nm using varying enzyme concentrations and 50 μm PGH2. Open table in a new tab P450 substrates and inhibitors typically induce spectral shifts on binding to the resting enzyme in the absence of NADPH+. Because PGH2 is unstable and is converted quickly to a different product even in the absence of NADPH+, we used stable cycloether analogs to probe the binding interaction attached to the heme site (Fig.7). U-44069 contains the ether oxygen attached to C-9, whereas the ether oxygen is attached to C-11 in U-46619. Incubation of U-44069 with rabbit P450 1A2 induced a reverse type 1 difference spectrum that exhibited a minimum at 386 nm and a maximum at 420 nm (Fig. 7 a). In contrast, U-46619 induced a type 1 spectrum with a minimum at 420 nm and a maximum at 386 nm at the same concentration (Fig. 7 b). The concentration dependence of U-44069 binding to rabbit P450 1A2 (Fig. 7 c, open squares) exhibited saturation behavior with aK s of 200 ± 20 μm. The concentration dependence of U-46619 exhibited a biphasic character with a type 1 spectrum at low concentrations (K s of 300 ± 500 μm) and a reverse type 1 spectrum at higher concentrations (K s of 900 ± 1300 μm). Human P450 3A4, which has an HHT/MDA synthase activity similar to rabbit 1A2 (Table I), bound both PGH2 analogs in a manner that produced type 1 spectral changes. Similar binding affinities were exhibited (K s = 240 ± 20 μm, U-44069; K s = 130 ± 10 μm, U-46619). Rat P450 2B1, which had 10-fold lower HHT synthase activity (Table I), bound both analogs more weakly in a manner that produced reverse type 1 spectral changes (K s = 1230 ± 40 μm, U-44069; K s = 890 ± 90 μm, U-46619). These data indicate that HHT/MDA synthase activities correlate with PGH2 analog binding affinities in the three enzymes tested. The P450s with higher HHT/MDA synthase activities, viz. human P450 3A4 and rabbit P450 1A2, bound at least one of the PGH2 analogs with aK s of less than 200 μm, and rat P450 2B1 that had lower HHT/MDA synthase activity bound both analogs withK s values close to 1 mm. During development of certain malignancies, there is increased expression of COX-2, which leads to increased production of PGH2. There is also an increased expression of xenobiotic-metabolizing P450s. The present results show that several of these P450s catalyze the conversion of PGH2 to HHT and the mutagen, MDA. Human liver microsomes have an HHT/MDA synthase activity that can be inhibited by P450 inhibitors. Recombinant and purified P450s also have HHT/MDA synthase activity, but other heme proteins do not. Both the HHT/MDA synthase activity of xenobiotic-metabolizing P450s and the ability of stable PGH2 analogs to bind to the active site varies widely between enzymes. These results suggest that aberrant expression of COX-2 and certain P450s in pre-malignant cells could lead to the stepwise conversion of arachidonic acid into a mutagen that can damage cellular DNA. The binding spectra of the oxabicycloheptane analogs (U-44069 and U-46619) suggest a specific interaction with the enzyme-binding site of rabbit P450 1A2 (Fig. 7). Reverse type 1 spectra are typical of oxygen ligands binding to the heme iron, and type 1 spectra are indicative of hydrophobic substrates displacing a weak oxygen ligand such as water or a hydroxyl group from the coordination site. In the case of rabbit P450 1A2, the reverse type I spectrum observed with U-44069, which has an ether oxygen attached to C-9, is consistent with the oxygen ligand interacting with the heme iron. On the other hand, if U-46619 binds in the same conformation, the C-9 substituent directed toward the heme iron would be a methylene group. This methylene could displace any weak endogenous oxygen ligand and produce the type 1 spectrum that was observed in Fig.7 b. At higher concentrations, U-46619 could bind in an alternate conformation allowing the C-11 ether oxygen to interact with the heme iron and produce the reverse type 1 spectrum that was observed in Fig. 7 c. However, human P450 3A4 bound both PGH2 analogs similarly which is consistent with its larger substrate-binding site (55.Lewis D.F. Eddershaw P.J. Dickins M. Tarbit M.H. Goldfarb P.S. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 115: 175-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Unlike thromboxane synthase, which coordinates to the C-9 oxygen, or prostacyclin synthase, which coordinates to the C-11 oxygen (22.Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we propose that most of the xenobiotic-metabolizing P450s bind PGH2 in either conformation to catalyze O–O bond scission. The identification of HHT/MDA synthase activity in human liver microsomes extends the observation by Hecker and Ullrich (22.Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that rat liver microsomes and the bacterial enzyme, P450CAM, convert PGH2 to predominantly HHT. The use of purified P450s allowed comparison of relative catalytic activities directly. The greater than 10-fold variation in the HHT/MDA synthase activity of different P450s indicates that the binding sites of these enzymes can accommodate PGH2 to differing degrees. The most active human P450 tested was 3A4 with an activity of 10 min−1 at 50 μm PGH2. The calculated activity of thromboxane synthase at the same substrate concentration would be 1142 min−1. This difference can be readily explained by the preferred substrates of these enzymes. The active site of thromboxane synthase is optimized for PGH2metabolism, whereas the xenobiotic-metabolizing P450s are notably promiscuous. By using site-directed mutagenesis Wang and co-workers (56.Wang L.H. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Hsu P.Y. Ruan K.H. Wu K.K. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19970-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) identified several residues important for thromboxane synthase activity. Ala-408 and Arg-413 were absolutely required for production of thromboxane, but the mutations did not convert thromboxane synthase into an efficient HHT/MDA synthase (56.Wang L.H. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Hsu P.Y. Ruan K.H. Wu K.K. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19970-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The HHT/MDA synthase activity of P450s need not be related to a high affinity binding site. The fact that a broad range of P450s can catalyze this reaction suggests that the structural requirement for HHT/MDA synthase activity is a relatively hydrophobic, open binding pocket with a P450-like heme to facilitate homolytic cleavage of the O–O bond (22.Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the fact that thromboxane synthase has higher HHT/MDA synthase than any other P450 tested, it is important to consider its expression pattern. Thromboxane synthase is expressed in colon tissue at levels similar to platelets (57.Shen R.F. Tai H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11585-11591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but immunohistochemistry experiments have shown that the expression is actually limited to the macrophage-like histiocytes (58.Nusing R. Fehr P.M. Gudat F. Kemeny E. Mihatsch M.J. Ullrich V. Virchows Arch. 1994; 424: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast to thromboxane synthase, P450s 1A and 3A are localized to the colonic mucosal epithelial cells that are the actual precursors of colorectal cancers (37.McKay J.A. Murray G.I. Weaver R.J. Ewen S.W. Melvin W.T. Burke M.D. Gut. 1993; 34: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The relative importance of tissue macrophage-produced MDA compared with colonic mucosa-produced MDA remains to be tested. Although the HHT/MDA synthase activity of the xenobiotic- metabolizing P450s is low compared with thromboxane synthase, cell culture experiments indicate that co-induction of COX-2 and a P450 may increase HHT/MDA production in vivo. When Hepa-1 cells were treated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, an inducer of both COX-2 and P450 1A1, HHT accounted for nearly 40% of the arachidonic acid metabolites (40.Puga A. Hoffer A. Zhou S. Bohm J.M. Leikauf G.D. Shertzer H.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast, Hepa-1-derived cells null for P450 1A1 produced half as much HHT but four times as much PGF2α (40.Puga A. Hoffer A. Zhou S. Bohm J.M. Leikauf G.D. Shertzer H.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is clear that levels of a P450 expressed from genomic copies using an endogenous promoter are sufficient to shift dramatically the PGH2 metabolite spectrum from prostanoids to HHT and MDA. This may be especially important in tissues where COX-2 is aberrantly expressed and the normal PGH2-converting enzymes are comparatively underexpressed. We have shown that a range of xenobiotic-metabolizing P450s can convert the intermediate in prostaglandin biosynthesis, PGH2, to an unsaturated fatty acid and the mutagen MDA. Future studies need to address whether increased COX-2 and P450 expression in developing cancers correlates with increased DNA damage by MDA-DNA adducts in order to assess to the relative importance of accelerated DNA damage by the mechanism proposed here."

The effects of mutation to alanine on haloperoxidase activity were studied for the proposed catalytic residue His-404 and for residue Asp-292, which is located close to the vanadate cofactor. The mutants were strongly impaired in their ability to oxidize chloride but still oxidized bromide, although they inactivate during turnover. The effects on the optical absorption spectrum of vanadium chloroperoxidase indicate that mutant H404A has a reduced affinity for the cofactor, whereas this affinity is unchanged in mutant D292A. The effect on the phosphatase activity of the apoenzyme was investigated for six mutants of putative catalytic residues. Effects of mutation of His-496, Arg-490, Arg-360, Lys-353, and His-404 to alanine are in line with their proposed roles in nucleophilic attack, transition-state stabilization, and leaving-group protonation. Asp-292 is excluded as the group that protonates the leaving group. A model based on the mutagenesis studies is presented and may serve as a template for glucose-6-phosphatase and other related phosphatases.

H2O2+H++X−→H2O+HOXEquation 1 Haloperoxidases are named after the most electronegative halide they are able to oxidize; thus, vanadium chloroperoxidase (VCPO)1 from Curvularia inaequalis oxidizes Cl−, Br−, and I−. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the cofactor vanadate (HVO42−), which is present in this enzyme, is bound covalently to His-496, resulting in a trigonal bipyramidal structure with 3 vanadate oxygens in the equatorial plane (1.Messerschmidt A. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 2.Messerschmidt A. Prade L. Wever R. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The Nε2 nitrogen of His-496 and the remaining vanadate oxygen occupy the 2 apical positions. The negative charge on the equatorial oxygens is compensated by H-bonds to 3 positively charged residues (Arg-490, Arg-360, and Lys-353). The apical oxygen has been assigned as a hydroxide group, and it is hydrogen-bonded to His-404. This residue is proposed to activate the hydroxide in the deprotonation of H2O2 before binding of the peroxide to the vanadium center (2.Messerschmidt A. Prade L. Wever R. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). A second residue that is a candidate to play a role as acid-base group in catalysis is Asp-292 (3.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H. Wever R. Tracey A.S. Crans D.C. Vanadium Compounds. Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Therapeutic Applications. Oxford University Press, American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C.1998: 216-227Google Scholar), which is also in the vicinity of the apical hydroxide and forms a salt bridge with Arg-490 (not shown in Fig. 1). Hydrogen peroxide is activated via binding to the vanadium center, after which the halide is oxidized. During this process the vanadium remains in the V (5+) state. Thus, it has been proposed that the vanadium acts as a Lewis acid, withdrawing electron density from the bound peroxide (2.Messerschmidt A. Prade L. Wever R. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 4.De Boer E. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12326-12332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Arber J.M. De Boer E. Garner C.D. Hasnain S.S. Wever R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7968-7973Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). On the basis of mutagenesis studies it has been proposed that this withdrawal of electron density is enhanced by the positively charged residues Arg-490, Arg-360, and Lys-353, which are in direct contact with the vanadate cofactor (6.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the peroxo form of the enzyme it can be seen that Lys-353 makes direct contact with one of the oxygens of the bound peroxide, and it has been suggested that this residue further activates the peroxide via charge separation on the peroxide oxygens. Recently, a scheme was published that describes in detail a proposal for the catalytic mechanism of vanadium haloperoxidases (6.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It was shown that the binding of vanadate, the binding of hydrogen peroxide, and the oxidation of halides can be monitored optically at 300–330 nm. As a consequence, individual steps in the reaction mechanism can be measured directly via stopped-flow techniques (27.Renirie R. Hemrika W. Piersma S.R. Wever R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and such studies indicate that the oxidation of Cl− by the peroxo intermediate occurs in at least two steps. Furthermore, it was shown that mutation of the vanadate binding residues His-496, Arg-360, Arg-490, and Lys-353 has a clear effect on the optical band. Three domains that are far apart in the primary structure form the active site of VCPO. These domains are also found in several classes of phosphatases (7.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 8.Neuwald A.F. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1764-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9.Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that the apo form of CPO exhibits phosphatase activity, although at a low rate compared with the phosphatases and to its peroxidase activity (7.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was suggested that the active sites of VCPO and the aligned phosphatases are similar. The structural basis for this similarity is the resemblance of phosphate and vanadate and, perhaps more importantly, the resemblance of the trigonal bipyramidal structure of bound vanadate in the native VCPO and the proposed transition state in the phosphatases. This is in line with the fact that these phophatases are strongly inhibited by vanadate (10.Singh J. Nordlie R.C. Jorgenson R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 678: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On the basis of this transition state analogy, it was suggested that in apoCPO His-496 acts as a nucleophile, whereas several residues stabilize the penta-coordinated transition state, and His-404 plays a role in leaving group protonation (7.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), the enzyme involved in von Gierke's disease, is one of the phosphatases predicted to have an active site similar to that of VCPO (7.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For this enzyme, a phosphohistidine enzyme intermediate has been isolated (11.Feldman F. Butler L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 268: 698-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12.Countaway J.L. Wadell I.D. Burchell A. Arion W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2673-2678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and based on mutation studies, His-119 was predicted to act as the nucleophile in catalysis (13.Lei K.J. Pan C.J. Liu J.L. Shelly L.L. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11882-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, based on the active-site structure of VCPO, we have predicted that His-176 of G6Pase is the nucleophile in catalysis, whereas His-119 is predicted to act as an acid base group (7.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This also led to a newly predicted nine-transmembrane helix topology for G6Pase, which was subsequently confirmed by experimental evidence (14.Hemrika W. Wever R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15.Pan C.J. Lei K.J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

It is shown that the effects on activity are in agreement with the effects on the optical spectra, and the implications for the peroxidase mechanism are discussed. Also, the phosphatase activity of the apo forms of H496A, R490A, R360A, K353A, D292A, and H404A is compared with that of apo-recombinant CPO (rCPO). On the basis of the results presented in this paper, in combination with crystal structure data of VCPO mutants, and clues from the peroxidase activity of the holo forms of these mutants, a reaction mechanism for the phosphatase activity is presented and discussed. Furthermore, the presteady state kinetics of the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) has been investigated, and we have obtained evidence as to which step in the proposed reaction mechanism is rate-limiting. The production and isolation of rCPO, H496A, R490A, R360A, and K353A is described in detail elsewhere (6.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mutants D292A and H404A were made directly in plasmid TNT14 (6.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) according to the Quikchange protocol (Stratagene) using primer 1-(D292A)5′-CTGGGCCTACGCCGGGTCAAACCTC-3′, the complementary primer 2-(D292A)5′-GAGGTTTGACCCGGCGTAGGCCCAG-3′, 3-(H404A)5′-ACCCATCTGGTGCCGCGACCTTTGG-3′, and the complementary primer 4-(H404A)-5′-CCAAAGGTCGCGGCACCAGATGGGT-3′. After checking for the desired mutation by manual sequencing using the T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the mutated pTNT14 derivatives were transformed to yeast, and mutant enzymes were isolated as described before (6.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). rCPO is produced as apoenzyme by the yeast expression system. The relative amount of apoenzyme was determined by comparison of the activity of the preparations in the absence and presence of 100 μm vanadate in an activity assay and was larger than 99% for rCPO. UV-visible absorbance spectra were taken on a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. Enzyme solutions contained 100 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 5.0 or 8.3. Before measurements, enzyme solutions were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in an MSE Micro Centaur centrifuge to eliminate absorption by any denatured protein. Haloperoxidase activity was measured qualitatively by the chlorination or bromination of 40 μmphenol red in the pH range 4–8 (100 mm citrate for pH 4–7 and 100 mm Tris-citric acid for pH 8) using a substrate concentration range of 100 μm–100 mm for both H2O2 and halide in the presence of 100 μm vanadate. Haloperoxidase activity was measured quantitatively by measuring the chlorination or bromination of monochlorodimedone (Δε = 20.1 mm−1cm−1 at 290 nm) using a Union-Giken RA-401 stopped-flow spectrophotometer thermostated at 20 °C. Steady-state phosphatase activity of the mutants was measured by following the hydrolysis of p-NPP using 200 nmenzyme. After incubation with this substrate at different pH values (100 mm citrate for pH 4–7 and 100 mmTris-citric acid for pH 8), reaction mixtures were quenched with NaOH, and production of para-nitrophenol was measured at 410 nm using an extinction coefficient of 16.6 mm−1cm−1. Presteady state phosphatase activity was monitored continuously at 410 nm using an extinction coefficient of 15.4 mm−1 cm−1 at pH 8.3, assuming a pK a of 7.15 for p-NPP. Steady-state phosphatase activity of the various mutants was measured on a single-beam Zeiss spectrophotometer, and phosphatase burst kinetics was measured on a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (17.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar), and the H2O2concentration was determined using a molar extinction coefficient of 43.6 m−1 cm−1 at 240 nm. H2O2 stocks were prepared daily. Enzyme solutions were concentrated using the Centricon-30 system (Amicon). The chlorinating activity of mutant H404A was investigated in the pH range 4–8; no activity was observed. However, at a bromide concentration of 100 mm clear bromoperoxidase activity was found with a pH optimum around pH 7 (not shown). However, quantitative kinetic analysis of this mutant is difficult due to partial inactivation of the enzyme, as can be seen in Fig.2. After an initial burst of about 25 μm HOBr formation, which corresponds to about 100 turnovers, a much slower activity is observed. The initial rate of 25 s−1 is about 20% of the brominating activity of recombinant VCPO, which remains constant in time (not shown). The slower phase has a turnover of 1 s−1. The extent of the initial burst is proportional to the enzyme concentration (not shown), and therefore it is difficult to observe and to quantify the burst at low enzyme concentrations. The observed inactivation of H404A during the first fast phase requires all components of turnover, since preincubations with individual components did not inactivate the enzyme. To test whether the inactivation is reversible, the assay mixture was centrifuged in a Centricon-30 after a turnover experiment, and the enzyme solution was subjected to 3 rounds of dilution and concentration with 20 volumes of buffer to remove all turnover components. The recovered enzyme was tested in a new assay mixture containing vanadate, and the initial burst was not observed, indicating that the inactivation is irreversible. The remaining activity corresponds to 75% of the slow phase, showing that only a minor percentage of the mutant enzyme is lost during dilution and concentration. For the heme-containing enzyme myeloperoxidase, direct oxidation of the HOBr-scavenger monochlorodimedone is observed (18.Harrison J.E. Schulz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1371-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Direct oxidation of monochlorodimedone has not been observed for the wild type vanadium enzyme, but mutations could in principle create this activity and related artifacts. However, no reaction is observed for the H404A mutant in the absence of bromide. Interestingly, preincubation with H2O2 results in a larger initial burst, corresponding to 45 μm HOBr (not shown), and a larger initial activity, corresponding to about 50% of the brominating activity of recombinant CPO. This may be due to a higher affinity for vanadate in the presence of H2O2as observed for the wild type enzyme (27.Renirie R. Hemrika W. Piersma S.R. Wever R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), resulting in more complete formation of holo form of the enzyme. In the absense of H2O2, only part of the H404A mutant will be in its holo form at a vanadate concentration of 100 μm. Recently, it was shown that it is possible to monitor the binding of vanadate to apo-CPO spectroscopically (27.Renirie R. Hemrika W. Piersma S.R. Wever R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Binding of vanadate at pH 8.3 results in a peak in the optical spectrum at 315 nm. The crystal structure of H404A (19.Macedo-Ribeiro S. Hemrika W. Renirie R. Wever R. Messerschmidt A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) indicates that vanadate is still bound, which is confirmed by an absorbance peak in the near-UV that is clearly different from that due to free vanadate (Fig.3). Fig. 3 A shows the optical spectra of H404A in its apo (a) and holo (b) form at pH 8.3. They differ clearly in the 300–330-nm region, as is also observed for rCPO (27.Renirie R. Hemrika W. Piersma S.R. Wever R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B shows that the vanadate-induced absorption increase (a) differs from the absorption due to free vanadate (b). In recombinant CPO, the titration of apoenzyme with vanadate results in a sharp end point, indicative of stochiometric binding. However, this is not observed in the H404A mutant, clearly indicating a lower affinity of the mutant for vanadate. Prolonged incubation of aporCPO with vanadate did not affect the curve, excluding the possibility that partial binding is caused by slow equilibrium establishment. The titration data can be satisfactorily fitted by a model in which the absorbance increase is due to contributions of holo-H404A and free vanadate, assuming that both exist as a single species. The fit (panel B,a) results in an extinction coefficient for free vanadate of 0.62 m−1 cm−1at 316 nm, which is almost identical to that estimated from Fig. 3, B,b (0.63 mm−1 cm−1). From the data a K d value of 112 ± 3 μm for vanadate was calculated that is 2–3 orders of magnitude larger than estimated for rCPO (27.Renirie R. Hemrika W. Piersma S.R. Wever R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Δε(holo-apo) is 2.1 mm−1 cm−1, which is smaller as compared with recombinant CPO (27.Renirie R. Hemrika W. Piersma S.R. Wever R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (2.8 mm−1cm−1). As in recombinant CPO (27.Renirie R. Hemrika W. Piersma S.R. Wever R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the intensity of the band of holo H404A decreases upon the addition of an equimolar amount of H2O2 (Fig. 3 A, spectrumc). The resulting peroxo species is stable for at least 30 min. Additional H2O2 did not induce a further decrease, indicating complete formation of the peroxo form of H404A. Interestingly, the peroxo species is formed on a time scale of seconds (not shown), whereas this process occurs on a millisecond timescale for rCPO (27.Renirie R. Hemrika W. Piersma S.R. Wever R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The addition of 1 mm Cl− to the peroxo form of H404A did not affect its spectrum. In contrast, in rCPO the original spectrum is restored immediately upon the addition of 1 mm Cl− at optimal pH. The addition of 100 μm Br− to the peroxo form of the mutant did result in immediate recovery of the native H404A spectrum, in line with the brominating activity observed for this mutant (Fig.4). At pH 5.0 a titration similar to that in Fig. 3 B using a vanadate concentration range of 0–500 μm resulted in an almost linear relationship between the absorbance and vanadate concentration (not shown), with an intensity approximately 2.5 times higher than that of free vanadate at this pH. This indicates that the mutant has a lower affinity for vanadate at pH 5.0 than at pH 8.3, a phenomenon that has also been reported for the wild type enzyme (20.Van Schijndel J.W.P.M. Simons L.H. Vollenbroek E.G.M. Wever R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The chlorinating activity of D292A was investigated in the pH range 4–8. Under standard assay conditions at pH 5.0 (1 mmH2O2, 5 mm Cl−), chlorinating activity is very low and corresponds to about 1% that of the wild type. A slightly higher activity is found at pH 4 (2%), and qualitative screening for brominating activity revealed an optimum value at low pH similar to that seen for the chlorinating activity (not shown). However, as for the H404A mutant, quantitative analysis is hampered by inactivation, as shown in Fig. 4. Trace a shows that this mutant is inactivated rapidly. After 25 s, the mutant has completely lost its activity (not shown). About 33 μmHOBr is formed, corresponding to about 420 turnovers. The amount of HOBr formed is proportional to the enzyme concentration (not shown), and the initial rate (475 s−1) is somewhat higher than that reported for the wild type (6.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The inactivation of D292A may be caused by loss of cofactor at low pH. Indeed, as can be seen from traceb, the mutant is inactivated by preincubation at pH 4.0. After washing the preincubated enzyme 3 times with 20 equivalents of 100 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, however, the activity is restored (not shown). This indicates that this inactivation is reversible, in contrast to that observed during turnover (tracea). Furthermore, trace c shows that preincubation of the mutant at pH 4.0 in the presence of H2O2does not result in inactivation, confirming that the inactivation observed in trace a is not due to the low pH. As in tracea, inactivation only occurs during turnover. The crystal structure of mutant D292A indicates that the mutant is still able to bind vanadate (19.Macedo-Ribeiro S. Hemrika W. Renirie R. Wever R. Messerschmidt A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of vanadate to apoD292A, a band is formed in the near UV with a peak at 315 nm, as shown in Fig. 5 A. This spectrum is identical to that of rCPO. Fig. 5 B shows the titration of 120 μm apoD292A with vanadate. A sharp point of intersection at 128 μm is observed, indicating stoichiometric binding of vanadate. The absorption increase at vanadate concentrations higher than 128 μm (Fig. 5 B) is due to that of free vanadate at 316 nm. From Fig. 5 B, an extinction coefficient Δε(holo-apo) at 316 nm of 2.8 mm−1 cm−1 was determined that is identical to that of rCPO (27.Renirie R. Hemrika W. Piersma S.R. Wever R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficients and estimated dissociation constants for vanadate for the various mutants and recombinant CPO are summarized in TableI.Table IExtinction coefficients of holo minus apo enzymes and dissociation constants for vanadate of recombinant CPO and various mutants as determined from optical spectroscopy experimentsEnzymeΔɛ (holo-apo)aΔɛ (holo-apo) was determined at 316 nm at pH 8.3 (100 mm Tris acetate), except for mutant R360A, which was determined at 308 nm.K d (vanadate)ReferencerCPO2.8 mm−1cm−1<20 μm27.Renirie R.

Open table in a new tab The formation of the peroxo species of this mutant occurs within the mixing time of the instrument (not shown), and no further decrease in intensity is observed upon further titration with H2O2, indicating that binding of H2O2 is both fast and strong in this mutant. Upon the addition of 1 mm chloride to the peroxo form of D292A, the native spectrum is not regenerated, even after an incubation of 30 min, whereas for rCPO this occurs rapidly. Spectra dand e (Fig. 5) show that the native spectrum of D292A is restored after the addition of Br−, in line with the observed brominating activity for this mutant. At pH 5.0, the optical absorbance band of D292A is still present, but it is shifted to 305–310 nm (not shown), a shift similar to that seen in rCPO (27.Renirie R. Hemrika W. Piersma S.R. Wever R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Δε(holo-apo) at 316 of 2.8 mm−1 cm−1 remains the same, whereas in rCPO, the value decreases upon lowering the pH. After the addition of 1 mm Cl−, the native spectrum is regenerated in 1 min, which is slower than for rCPO but in line with the remaining chlorinating activity of mutant D292A observed at this pH in steady state experiments. The addition of 100 μmBr− immediately converts the peroxo spectrum back to that of the native enzyme. Attempts were made to study the optical spectrum at pH 4.0, which is the optimum for activity observed in the steady state brominating experiments. At this pH value, however, 100 μm D292A precipitates. rCPO also precipitates at this concentration, indicating that this effect is not due to the mutation. To confirm the proposed role of the various residues in the mechanism of the phosphatase reaction catalyzed by apoCPO, mutants of these residues were investigated. TableII shows the phosphatase activity of rCPO and mutant CPOs at various concentrations of the phosphatase substratep-NPP and different pH values. p-NPP concentrations were chosen around and well above the previously reported K m value for this substrate (about 50 μm at pH 4.5–8.0 (7.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar)). Mutant H496A was inactive under all substrate concentrations tested, consistent with the proposed role of His-496 as nucleophile in the phosphatase reaction (7.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In line with their proposed role in binding phosphate oxygens in the trigonal bipyramidal transition state (7.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the single-site mutants of the positively charged residues Arg-490, Arg-360, and Lys-353 exhibit decreased activity. R490A is completely inactive, and a significant decrease in maximal activity of R360A and K353A as compared with rCPO is observed. This is not a consequence of increasedK m values for the substrate, since an increase of the concentration of p-NPP from 1 to 10 mm did not affect the activity. Both His-404 and Asp-292 have been proposed to be involved in the protonation of the leaving group (3.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H. Wever R. Tracey A.S. Crans D.C. Vanadium Compounds. Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Therapeutic Applications. Oxford University Press, American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C.1998: 216-227Google Scholar, 7.Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, for D292A, considerable activity is still found (62%), although theK m value has increased to the mm range. For H404A, no activity is observed.Table IIPhosphatase activity of recombinant CPO and active mutant CPOsEnzyme[p-NPP]pH45678mmrCPO0.1973654843143958264671052100836869R360A0.18121255112151476101015"

In their structures one or several saccharidic moieties are present, attached to a macrocyclic lactone. These sugars are usually important or, in some cases, essential for bioactivity, and they are transferred to the different aglycones as late steps in biosynthesis by means of the catalytic action of glycosyltransferases. Most macrolides are produced by streptomycetes and the biosynthesis of a potentially lethal antibiotic by these microorganisms requires the existence of a self-resistance mechanism in the producing microorganism to avoid cell suicide. One of the resistance mechanisms so far described in macrolide producing strains is the existence of intracellular glycosyltransferases. These enzymes inactivate macrolides by glycosylation of a hydroxyl group present in one of the 6-deoxyhexoses attached to the macrolactone ring. This enzyme activity was initially found in a nonmacrolide producer strainStreptomyces lividans (1.Jenkins G. Cundliffe E. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and in the oleandomycin (OM) producer Streptomyces antibioticus (2.Vilches C. Hernández C. Méndez C. Salas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 161-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Later on it has been found that such enzyme activity is also present in 15 out of 32 streptomycetes producers of different polyketides (3.Sasaki J. Mizoue K. Morimoto S. Omura S. J. Antibiot. 1996; 49: 1110-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The oleandomycin producer contains a second enzyme activity that converts the inactive glycosylated oleandomycin into active antibiotic by removing the glucose moiety from the inactive compound (2.Vilches C. Hernández C. Méndez C. Salas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 161-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This glycosidase has been purified from the culture supernatant of this microorganism (4.Quirós L.M. Hernández C. Salas J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 222: 129-135Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Consequently S. antibioticus, which possesses ribosomes that are sensitive to oleandomycin all along the cell cycle and even during the production phase (5.Fierro J.F. Hardisson C. Salas J.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 1931-1939PubMed Google Scholar), might use this inactivation/reactivation system as a self-resistance mechanism to survive during the biosynthesis of the drug. In the oleandomycin biosynthesis gene cluster of S. antibioticus, a gene (oleI) that encodes an specific oleandomycin glycosyltransferase has been identified (6.Quirós L.M. Aguirrezabalaga I. Olano C. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the same microorganism, a gene codifying a macrolide glycosyltransferase (MGT)1activity able to transfer a glucose moiety to many macrolides and located outside the oleandomycin biosynthesis gene cluster (OleD) has been cloned (7.Hernández C. Olano C. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the last several years, some genes codifying glycosyltransferases involved in the transfer of sugars to various aglycones have been cloned and sequenced, and their genetical relations analyzed. However, biochemical information about these enzymes is scarce. In this paper, we report the characterization of the MGT coded by the oleDgene and the elucidation of the structure of the glucosylated oleandomycin (GS-OM). Kinetic studies to obtain information about the enzyme mechanism are also performed, as well as pH studies to determine values for the molecular pK values in order to suggest possible amino acid residues involved in the catalytic process. Oleandomycin and UDP-glucuronic acid-agarose were purchased from Sigma. UDP-[6-3H]glucose (specific activity 17.5 Ci·mmol−1) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. UDP-Glucose, UTP, UDP, and dithiothreitol (DTT) were from Sigma. Acrylamide and bisacrylamide were from Bio-Rad. Acetonitrile (HPLC grade) and ammonium sulfate were from Merck, and Q-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and were of analytical grade. For the purification of the MGT coded by the oleD gene, S. lividans LQD (S. lividans TK21 harboring plasmid pLQD) was grown in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 500 ml of tripticasein soy broth (Oxoid) liquid medium in the presence of 5 μg ml−1 thiostrepton. The cultures were inoculated with 25 μl of a dense spore suspension and, after incubation for 48 h at 30 °C on an orbital shaker incubator (200 rpm), the mycelia was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g during 10 min. The mycelial paste was washed twice with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). The mycelia was then disrupted by two passes through a French Press at a pressure of 1,500 psi. DNA was broken by ultrasounds (3 pulses of 15 s each with intermittent cooling on ice water) in a MSE ultrasonic disintegrator at 150 W and 20 kHz. Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. Nucleic acids were precipitated with streptomycin sulfate (1% final concentration) and the supernatant fractionated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. Fractions precipitating between 40 and 60% saturation were recovered and extensively dialyzed against buffer A. This fraction was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (200 ml volume) at a flow rate of 3 ml min−1; the column was eluted with a linear gradient from 0–0.4 m NaCl. Active fractions were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (95% saturation) and, after centrifugation, the precipitate was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl) before extensive dialysis against buffer B. The sample was then applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (2.6 × 90 cm) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min−1. Active fractions were dialyzed against buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, and 20% glycerol) and then applied to a glucuronic acid-agarose column (10 ml) at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. Elution was with a 0–0.35m NaCl linear gradient in buffer C. The glycosylation of different macrolide antibiotics was performed in a reaction mixture containing (for a 50 μl final volume): 1 μl of antibiotic (100 μm final concentration), 0.1 μl of UDP-[3H]Glc (0.114 μm final concentration), and 1 μl of UDP-Glc (50 μm final concentration). The reaction was monitored as described previously (8.Quirós L.M. Salas J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18234-18239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Spores of Streptomyces violaceoniger ETH 20388 were inoculated in tripticasein soy broth medium and incubated in an orbital shaker at 30 °C and 250 rpm. After 24 h, this culture was used to inoculate at 2.5% (v/v) in 40 Erlenmeyer flasks of 250 ml, each containing 50 ml of R5A medium (modified R5 medium as described in Ref. 9.Fernández E. Weiβbach U. Sánchez Reillo C. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Rohr J. Salas J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation for 5 days in the above conditions, the cultures were centrifuged and the supernatant was filtered (0.45 μm pore size membrane filters) and applied to a solid-phase extraction cartridge (Superclean LC-18, 10 g; Supelco). The cartridge was eluted with methanol and water, using a linear gradient from 0 to 100% methanol in 60 min, at a flow rate of 10 ml min−1. Fractions were taken every 5 min and upon HPLC analysis, LK was located in fractions eluting between 40 and 50 min. Material in these fractions was dried under vacuum, redissolved in a small volume of methanol, and LK was purified by preparative HPLC using a μBondapak C18 radial compression cartridge (PrepPak Cartridge, 25 by 100 mm; Waters) in two steps. First, the extracted material was eluted with acetonitrile and water using a linear gradient from 40 to 60% acetonitrile in 30 min, at 10 ml min−1. Peak containing LK was repurified with methanol and water as solvents and eluted with a linear gradient of 60 to 80% methanol in 30 min, at 10 ml min−1. The final pure product was concentrated under vacuum and lyophilized. Antibiotics were separated in a Symmetry C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Waters). Detection and spectral characterization of peaks was performed with a photodiode array detector, extracting bi-dimensional chromatograms at 201 nm. Solvents for analysis of OM and GS-OM were acetonitrile and 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.3. Compounds were eluted using a linear gradient from 10 to 50% acetonitrile in 20 min, followed by an isocratic hold of 10 min in the final conditions. For analysis of LK and GS-LK, water was used instead of phosphate buffer and the gradient was from 10 to 100% acetonitrile in 30 min. Flow rate was 1 ml min−1 in all cases. NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker AMX 400 spectrometer operating at 400.13 MHz and 100.61 MHz for1H and 13C, respectively, using a 5-mm QXI1H/13C/15N/31P reverse probe including a z-gradient coil. CD3OD was used as solvent and chemical shifts were referenced internally to tetramethylsilane. Sample concentration was 0.1 mm. Pulse widths were 8.5 μs/13.7 μs for 1H/13C at an attenuation level of 3 dB on both channels. A 5% sinus truncated shaped pulse gradient of 1 ms was used with values 5:3:4 for both gs-HMQC and gs-HMBC. Standard Bruker software has been used to acquire and process the 13C DEPT, gs-HMQC, and gs-HMBC spectra. Selected parameters for 1H,13C two-dimensional correlations: sweep width 2400 Hz for 1H and 19000 Hz for13C; 2048 × 512 data set; pre-acquisition delay 2 s; number of scans 16–32; magnitude mode; data processing using zero filling in the F1 domain and shifted sinus-bell apodization of factor 0 in both dimensions. For HMQC GARP decoupling of13C was used during acquisition. Analysis of the samples during protein purification was performed using SDS-PAGE (10.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1971; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Protein estimation was carried out by measurement of absorbance at 280 nm and by a protein-dye binding assay (11.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). Initial velocity assays were carried out using the radiolabeled assay as described above. The concentration of one substrate was varied while the concentration of the second substrate was held at a nonsaturating concentration. After stopping the reaction, the amount of glucosylated antibiotic was estimated. The experimental data reported here were all carried out at least in duplicate. Data were analyzed by linear and nonlinear regression using the program Statistica for Windows (Statsoft, Inc.). The exchange reactions between UDP-[3H]Glc and [3H]GS-LK were assayed by measuring the formation of [3H]GS-LK from UDP-[3H]Glc and unlabeled LK. Assays were performed as described under “Steady State Kinetics,” except that the concentrations of unlabeled reactants and products were adjusted to the equilibrium conditions at the beginning of the experiment. The concentrations for the unchanged pair were 0.4 and 5 μm, and the concentrations of the changed pair were varied from 0.25 to 50 times the concentration of the other pair depending on the assay. After addition of enzyme, the reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. A small concentration (10 nm) of UDP-[3H]Glc was added subsequently, samples were taken at different times and processed as described (8.Quirós L.M. Salas J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18234-18239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and used to calculate the rate of isotopic exchange. The MGT coded by theoleD gene is able to transfer glucose from UDP-Glc to different macrolide antibiotics (6.Quirós L.M. Aguirrezabalaga I. Olano C. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although any of those macrolides could be used to assay the reaction, in this work OM was first chosen as substrate for the purification and characterization of the enzyme. The MGT was purified 371-fold with an 19.8% yield using the 4-step purification procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first stage in the purification was the fractionation of the cell-free extract by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by three chromatographic steps using anionic exchange (Q-Sepharose), gel filtration (Sephacryl S-200), and affinity (UDP-glucuronic acid-agarose) (Fig. 1). A summary of the procedure is shown in Table I and Fig.2. The major band observed by SDS-PAGE migrated at 51 kDa and is likely to be the OleD glycosyltransferase, although this has not yet been confirmed directly by demonstrating that the enzyme activity comigrates with this protein species. The enzyme activity was eluted from the Q-Sepharose column at 0.19 mNaCl (Fig. 1 A) and from the UDP-glucuronic acid-agarose column at 0.18 m NaCl (Fig. 1 C). The activity was moderately unstable when kept at low temperature, although the addition of 20% glycerol was found to stabilize the enzyme, keeping the activity for several weeks at 4 °C and for at least several months when kept at −70 °C. Enzyme activity was shown to be unaffected by the addition of different mono or divalent cations.Table IPurification of the MGT activityPurification stepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityRecoveryPurificationmgnmol · min −1nmol · min −1 · mg protein −1%-foldExtract92023532.61001(NH4)2SO456417413.1741.2Q-Sepharose26134151.65720.1Sephacryl S-2004.7994213.34283.3UDP-glucuronic-agarose0.546695119.8371.5 Open table in a new tab Figure 2SDS-PAGE analysis of the different steps in the purification of the MGT activity.

Similar results were obtained when the experiment was performed using different macrolides as substrates of the reaction, such as erythromycin or tylosin (data not shown). This effect did not depend on the buffer used, since the velocities obtained were nearly identical when overlapping the different buffers or when a three-component buffer mixture giving virtually constant ionic strength was used (12.Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). The only exception to this observation occurred when Tris-HCl was used for buffering the reaction mixtures using tylosin as substrate, decreasing the velocity of the catalysis by about 40%. All the macrolides used in these experiments possess a desosamine moiety in their structures. Desosamine is an aminodeoxy sugar including a basic tertiary amine bounded to C 3′. The pK a for the protonation of this group is 8.8 both for the oleandomycin (data from our laboratory) and erythromycin (13.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). The curve of activity measured for these antibiotics increased its slope at pH values over 8.5 and, consequently, it could be showing an effect of substrate ionization on the enzyme activity. LK is a macrolide antibiotic produced by S. violaceoniger. Its structure has two sugar moieties, lankavose and acetylarcanose (Fig. 4 A), none of them included the amine group of desosamine. This antibiotic was produced and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and used as substrate for the MGT. The velocity of the reaction at different pH values showed the typical bell-shaped curve with an optimum at pH 8 (Fig. 4 B), reinforcing the idea that the effects measured on the other macrolides could be explained by ionization of the substrates. To determine the structure of the reaction product of glycosylation of OM by the MGT, reactions were performed using that antibiotic as substrate, and the product purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first evidence for the glycosylation in the NMR spectra was the appearance of six additional 13C NMR signals respective to the initial OM substrate. The rest of the signals presented no significant changes with respect to OM, which suggests the same macrocyclic structure plus a new sugar ring. The structural characterization of the compound was performed by the complete assignment of all the 1H and 13C NMR spectral signals. For this purpose, apart from the 1H and13C NMR spectra, other experiments as DEPT, 1H,13C HMQC, and HMBC were necessary. The strategy of the work was to establish in the HMBC spectrum the connectivity of a known carbon with protons separated by two or three bonds and then to find out in the HMQC spectrum the direct response via1JCH of these protons with their corresponding carbon nuclei. The most evident starting point for the characterization was the 13C carbonyl signals from the C-1 (δ 178.82) and C-9 (δ 210.56) (Table II) macrocyclic ring carbons, as they showed the highest deshielding in the13C NMR spectra. The HMBC spectrum showed correlation peaks through 2 or 3 bonds between C-1 and the proton signals H2, H3, H13, and H315, while C-9 correlates with H7, H10, H11, H18, and H319. The rest of the macrocyclic 1H and13C signals could be sequentially assigned using the information contained in the HMBC spectrum. The identification of the sugar moieties came from the correlation peaks seen in the same HMBC experiment between protons H5 and H3 with the anomeric carbons C-1′ and C-1“, respectively. From these starting points the rest of the sugar rings could be easily assigned using the same process discussed above. The direct evidence for the glycosylation position came from the cross-peak found between H2′ and C-1′”, and between H1′“ and C-2′. The conformation of the sugar rings was deduced from the scalar coupling constants of the protons, as shown in Fig.5.Table II1 H and 13 C NMR data of glycosylated oleandomycin in CD3OD at 25 °CSiteδ13Cδ1HMultiplicityJ(H, H)(Hz)ppm1178.82—246.202.73m380.393.81dd1.5, 4.6446.471.83m583.593.49d9.8634.911.89m733.591.58dd10.8, 15.32.50dd4.2, 15.3865.329210.561046.503.17dc1.7, 6.81171.293.76dd1.7, 9.41243.271.66ddc1.8, 6.9, 9.41372.215.32dc1.8, 6.61418.591.28d6.61513.891.16d7.21610.461.18d7.11720.001.13d6.71850.902.71d5.02.76d5.0198.750.98d6.82010.110.98d6.91′104.004.34d7.32′82.613.35dd7.3, 10.43′66.912.78m4′30.571.27m1.78m5′70.103.55m6′21.821.21d6.17′, 8′41.062.27s1“100.054.95dd1.2, 3.72“35.841.44ddd3.7, 11.7, 12.72.37ddd1.2, 4.6, 12.73“79.393.41ddd4.6, 8.9, 11.74“77.683.02dd8.9, 9.05“70.893.69m6“18.991.24d6.27“57.663.42s1‴107.774.40d7.72‴76.813.22dd7.7, 9.03‴78.613.35m4‴72.103.28m5‴78.433.29m6‴63.663.67dd5.5, 11.73.84dd2.3, 11.7 Open table in a new tab The kinetic study of the reaction catalyzed by the MGT was performed using LK as substrate. When the initial velocity was measured varying the concentration of LK at different fixed concentrations of UDP-Glc, a set of intersecting lines was obtained by regression analysis of the data at each UDP-Glc concentration (Fig. 6). To obtain estimates of the kinetic constants, the full data set was then fit by performing nonlinear regression analysis to the equation of Alberty, v=V·A·BKia·Kb+Ka·B+Kb·Λ+Λ·BEquation 1 where, according to the nomenclature of Cleland (14.Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 104-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Aand B, represent the concentrations of the first and second substrate, respectively, that bind to the enzyme. V isV max, K a andK b are the K m values forA and B, respectively, and K iais the dissociation constant for the reaction of A with the free enzyme. The following parameters were obtained: V= 70.64 ± 5,65 μmol min−1 mg protein−1; K a = 33.17 ± 3.27 μm; K b = 599.6 ± 0.3 μm; K ia = 4.2 ± 0.53 μm. Equation 1 is followed for most of the reaction mechanisms involving a two-substrate enzyme. The presence of the term K iaand K b with a value different from 0 is responsible for the intersection of the lines to the left of the 1/vaxis. The difference in value between K ia andK a (K ia < K a) places the intersection point below the horizontal axis. This result is indicative of a sequential mechanism in wich a ternary complex is formed prior to product release although it does not specify the order of substrate addition. Dead-end inhibitors were used to obtain information about the mechanism of the reaction and the substrate binding order. The concentration of one substrate was fixed at a subsaturating level, and the concentration of the other substrate varied; experiments were performed at different concentrations of the dead-end inhibitor, including 0. MGT was able to transfer glucose from UDP-Glc to all the macrolides assayed (6.Quirós L.M. Aguirrezabalaga I. Olano C. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The only exception to this rule was clarithromycin. Structurally, clarithromycin is very similar to erythromycin, except for the presence of a methoxy group instead of a hydroxyl at the C-6 of the macrolactone (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, because of this change the molecule is not a substrate for the MGT. When clarithromycin was added to the reaction using LK as the varied substrate, a set of lines of different slopes was observed, while the intersection point remained constant, thus indicating a competitive inhibition (Fig.7 A). If the substrate varied was UDP-Glc, the lines changed both in their slope and intersection point (Fig. 7 B), implying noncompetitive inhibition. UTP was also found to act as a dead-end inhibitor of the reaction. When reactions were carried out in the presence of UTP using UDP-Glc as the varied substrate, the lines changed their slopes but the intersection point remained constant, suggesting competitive inhibition (Fig.7 D). If the varied substrate was LK, the lines were parallel, with unchanged slope but with changed point of intersection, indicating uncompetitive inhibition (Fig. 7 C). Data from dead-end inhibitors are summarized in TableIII. The patterns of inhibition observed showed noncompetitive inhibition for clarithromycin when UDP-Glc is varied and uncompetitive inhibition for UTP when LK is varied, and this is only compatible with a compulsory-order mechanism (15.Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 467-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, it does not differentiate between formation of a ternary complex or if its concentration is negligible (Theorell-Chance mechanism). On the other hand, these results allow confirmation of the substrate addition order, being LK first and UDP-Glc second.Table IIIDead-end inhibition analysis for MGTInhibitorVaried substrateFixed substratePatternK isK iiμmClarithromycinLKUDP-GlcCompetitive0.00801 ± 0.00042ClarithromycinUDP-GlcLKNoncompetitive0.01740 ± 0.000640.0117 ± 0.00047UTPLKUDP-GlcUncompetitive4030 ± 510UTPUDP-GlcLKCompetitive570 ± 30 Open table in a new tab The type of inhibition that is given by the products of the reaction constitutes another way to distinguish between the kinetic pathways obeyed by two-substrate reactions (16.Rudolph F.B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 411-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). GS-LK was obtained performing reactions of glycosylation using LK as substrate, and purifying the product as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The addition of this molecule to the reaction using LK as varied substrate produced a pattern of competitive inhibition (Fig.8 A). If the varied substrate was UDP-Glc a pattern of noncompetitive inhibition was the result (Fig.8 B). On the other hand, when the other product of the reaction, UDP, was used as inhibitor, a pattern of noncompetitive inhibition was obtained both if the substrate varied was LK or UDP-Glc (Fig. 8, C and D). Results from product inhibition studies are summarized in TableIV. These results confirm those obtained using dead-end inhibitors, showing a compulsory-order mechanism in which a ternary complex is formed.Table IVProduct inhibition analysis for MGTInhibitorVaried substrateFixed substratePatternK isK iiμmGS-LKLKUDP-GlcCompetitive974 ± 94GS-LKUDP-GlcLKNoncompetitive465 ± 161052 ± 221UDPLKUDP-GlcNoncompetitive291 ± 771.7 ± 0.6UDPUDP-GlcLKNoncompetitive28.4 ± 7.4351.4 ± 91.7 Open table in a new tab The equilibrium constant for the MGT reaction might be expected to be independent of pH as no net production or uptake of protons occurs during the course of the reaction. The time taken to reach equilibrium was first established by measurement of the change in the concentration of GS-LK with time after addition of the enzyme to solutions similar to those described below. Reaction was always completed in less than 2 h. K was measured by fixing the ratio of [LK]/[GS-LK] at 1 and varying the ratio of [UDP]/[UDP-Glc] from 20 to 400. A plot of the change in GS-LK concentration versus [UDP]/[UDP-Glc] is shown in Fig.9. The value at which the line intercepts with the ordinate axis for an abscissa value of 0 is equal to the equilibrium constant, K = 156.34. To complete the study of the reaction, we performed isotopic exchange experiments under equilibrium conditions. The concentration of a substrate-product pair was varied so as not to disturb the equilibrium; its effect on the rate of isotopic exchange between UDP-[3H]Glc and [3H]GS-LK was then determined. The progress curve for the exchange, monitored by sampling the reaction mixture at different time intervals, showed in all the cases a first-order rate law; these curves were used to calculate the rates of exchange as described previously (17.Purich D.L. Allison R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 3-46Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The exchange rate was also directly proportional to enzyme concentration, as should be expected in the absence of subunit dissociation and association effects. When the effect of increased concentrations of the pair LK/GS-LK on the rates of exchange between UDP-[3H]Glc and [3H]GS-LK was measured, a hyperbolic plot was obtained (Fig. 10 A). In a similar experiment varying the pair LK/UDP, a plot hyperbolic with depletion at high concentrations of the pair LK/UDP was obtained (Fig.10 A). These results are consistent only if the products are released form the catalytic center of the enzyme in a specific order, first UDP and later GS-LK. Rising the concentration of the LK/UDP pair makes the enzyme-GS-LK and enzyme species scarce, increasing other forms, and the exchange rates are lowered. If the concentration of the LK/GS-LK pair was raised, only the free enzyme becomes scarce and the rates of exchange approach a maximum asymptotically. In similar experiments, the rates of isotopic exchange at equilibrium were measured varying the concentration of the pairs composed by the second substrate and one of the different products. Increasing the concentration of the UDP-Glc/GS-LK pair a hyperbolic plot was produced (Fig. 10 B), while the increase of the UDP-Glc/UDP pair produced a plot which initially increased but later showed a depression at higher concentrations (Fig. 10 B). These results confirm the order of product release, since rising the concentration of the UDP-Glc/UDP pair increases the concentrations of the central enzymic forms, and depresses the rate of isotopic exchange. This is compatible only with an ordered mechanism in which a ternary complex is formed. In a Theorell-Chance mechanism, the increase in the UDP-Glc/UDP pair would produce a hyperbolic plot since in this mechanism the process EA+B ↔EQ+P is a simple bimolecular process. In summary, all the kinetic information described about the reaction mechanism of the MGT can be represented as in SchemeFS1. The substrates bind in a compulsory order to the enzyme, first the LK and then the UDP-Glc to form a ternary complex in which the exchange reaction takes place. Product release also occurs in a compulsory order, UDP first followed subsequently by GS-LK. As it was pointed out before, the MGT is active over a limited range of pH, showing a “bell-shaped” curve with an optimum at pH 8 when LK is used as substrate (Fig.3 B). The optimum observed may be due to a pH effect onV max, on the affinity, on the stability of the enzyme, or a combination of these effects (18.Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3th Ed. Longman Group Ltd., Academic Press Inc., New York1979Google Scholar). To determine whether the measured effect was taking place by irreversible destruction, the enzyme was exposed to a range of pH values for a similar time to that of the reaction, and then the activity was tested immediately after readjusting the pH to 8; results showed that the enzyme was stable between pH 5.5 and 11 (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the shape of the curve might be due to reversible effect of the pH on the other factors. Since changes in the pH may affect either the K m or the V max, in order to obtain useful information it is necessary to investigate the effects of pH on the kinetic parameters of the reaction catalyzed. Steady state initial velocity studies varying the LK concentration at different fixed UDP-Glc concentrations were performed at the different pH values, and the results analyzed fitting the full data set to the equation of Alberty (Eq. 1) by performing nonlinear regression analysis. Results are represented as the logarithms of V,V/K a, andV/K b against pH (Fig.11), following the method of Dixon (19.Tipton K.F. Dixon H.B.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 183-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). pK m against the pH plot is not represented, since this graph is a combination of the V andV/K m plots. In all the cases, as expected, only downward bends were obtained, being the pKvalues those corresponding to the intersect of the extensions of the linear portions. The pK values obtained from experiments of the type described before are frequently used to identify ionizable groups involved in the catalysis. Nevertheless, care must be taken in the interpretation of results since those molecular pK values obtained are relatively complex molecular constants rather than simple group constant, and pK values of groups may be greatly affected by their environments, whereas the given values in the literature are those for groups in an aqueous environment. In reactions involving more than one substrate it is also important to check that the kinetic mechanism does not change with pH; this is probably correct for the MGT since double-reciprocal plots at all the pH values analyzed showed a set of lines intersecting below the horizontal axis, and inhibition by UDP at pH values 6 and 10 showed a noncompetitive pattern (data not shown). Despite these reservations, many pH studies have yielded results that have been shown by other methods to be substantially correct in identifying the pK values of groups involved (19.Tipton K.F. Dixon H.B.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 183-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Even if pK values are shifted, an approximate value for a pK may give an indication of the type of group involved in a process. Comparison of the pK values obtained in the experiments performed with those described for side chain ionizing groups of amino acids could give information about groups involved in the catalysis. The molecular pK values obtained from graphs forV/K a and V/K b showed values of about 6.65–9.4 and 6.8–9.65, respectively (Fig. 11,B and C). The values are separated by about 2.8 pH units, introducing an uncertainty on the estimation of about 0.2 pH units (20.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). The plots of V/K m against pH give pK values for the ionization of the free enzyme and free substrates rather than for the ES complex (18.Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3th Ed. Longman Group Ltd., Academic Press Inc., New York1979Google Scholar). LK does not ionize over the pH range considered, but pK values of 6.5 and 9.4 have been described for UDP-Glc (13.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Therefore, although ionization of the enzyme at the observed molecular pK values could be occurring, is the ionization of the free substrate what could be responsible for the observed results. The log V against pH plot showed two intersections at about 6.6 and 10.4 (Fig. 11 A); the values are separated by 3.8 pH units allowing us to determine the pK values in a straight-forward manner (20.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). The effect of pH on V is determined for the state of ionization of the enzyme-substrate (ES) complex, so we can obtain molecular pKvalues for ES from the position of the bends in the graph. Basic residues like lysine or tyrosine could be related with the observed pK of 10.4, since both amino acids shows pK values when present at the active site of enzymes ranging from 9.5 to 10.6 and 9.8 to 10.5, respectively (20.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). The other pK value of 6.6 is close to one of the pK values determined from the V/K m plots; although an ionization of the bound substrate could be considered, the absence of the other pK due to the ionization of the uridine can be an indication that the observed pK is due to ionization of a residue in the active site of the enzyme. pKvalues from 5.5 to 7.0 have been reported for histidine when present at the active sites (20.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1993Google Scholar), having a good correlation with the determined value for the molecular pK. Otherwise, a catalytic mechanism involving one or two nucleophilic substitutions has been proposed for glycosyltransferases from nucleotide diphospho sugars (21.Saxena I.M. Brown R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid sequences of several glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of polyketides showed a very well conserved region including 1 or 2 histidines (Fig. 12). The considerations given before, and the effectiveness of the imidazole side chain of histidine as a nucleophilic catalyst, makes this motive a good candidate for being part of the active center of this group of enzymes.

One of the two major routes for detoxication of homocysteine is the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)1-dependent β-replacement reaction with l-serine catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS; EC 4.2.1.22). L­homocysteine+L­serine→L­cystathionine+H2OEquation 1 The deduced sequences of human (4,5), rat (6.Swaroop M. Bradley K. Ohura T. Tahara T. Roper M.D. Rosenberg L.E. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11455-11461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), andSaccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) (7,8) CBS are similar. The finding that human CBS complements the cysteine auxotrophy of a yeast strain lacking CBS (5.Kruger W.D. Cox D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6614-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) demonstrates the functional conservation of the human and yeast genes. The remarkable observation that the sequence of rat CBS (6.Swaroop M. Bradley K. Ohura T. Tahara T. Roper M.D. Rosenberg L.E. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11455-11461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is identical to the sequence of rat hemoprotein H-450 (9.Ishihara S. Morohashi K. Sadano H. Kawabata S. Gotoh O. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 899-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) led to the discovery that rat and human CBS contain both PLP and heme (10.Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25283-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heme may play a role in redox regulation of the human enzyme and in binding homocysteine (11,12). Although yeast CBS has been purified to homogeneity (13.Ono B. Kijima K. Inoue T. Miyoshi S. Matsuda A. Shinoda S. Yeast. 1994; 10: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the absorption spectrum and cofactor content have not been reported. 2After this work was completed and reported in abstract and poster form at the 10th International Symposium of Vitamin B6 and Carbonyl Catalysis and 4th Meeting on PQQ and Quinoproteins, Santa Fe, New Mexico, October 31–November 5, 1999, we learned that another group had purified CBS from S. cerevisiae and found that the enzyme is not dependent on heme (K. N. Maclean, M. Janosik, J. Oliveriusova, V. Kery, and J. P. Kraus, submitted for publication). 2After this work was completed and reported in abstract and poster form at the 10th International Symposium of Vitamin B6 and Carbonyl Catalysis and 4th Meeting on PQQ and Quinoproteins, Santa Fe, New Mexico, October 31–November 5, 1999, we learned that another group had purified CBS from S. cerevisiae and found that the enzyme is not dependent on heme (K. N. Maclean, M. Janosik, J. Oliveriusova, V. Kery, and J. P. Kraus, submitted for publication). Here, we demonstrate that purified yeast CBS contains PLP but not heme. Because the absence of heme facilitates spectroscopic studies of the PLP and of enzyme-substrate intermediates, we are able to demonstrate directly that CBS converts l-serine to an aminoacrylate intermediate, as expected for a PLP enzyme that catalyzes a β-replacement reaction (14,15). l-Cystathionine andl-serine were from Fluka. δ-Aminolevulinic acid,l-homocysteine thiolactone, aprotinin, pepstatin A, leupeptin, benzamidine hydrochloride, TPCK, TLCK, and PMSF were from Sigma. Gigapite was from Seikagaku, Japan. l-Homocysteine was prepared from l-homocysteine thiolactone as described (16.Suda M. Nakagawa H. Kimura H. Tabor H. Tabor C.W. Methods in Enzymology. 17B. Academic Press, New York1973: 454-458Google Scholar, 17.Drummond J.T. Jarrett J. Gonzalez J.C. Huang S. Matthews R.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). l-[U-14C]Serine (160 mCi/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. To overexpress CBS from S. cerevisiae, we ligated the 1.5-kb PCR product containing the CBS gene from PSTR4-2 (cys4) 3PSTR4-2 (cys4) was a generous gift from Dr. Yolande Surdin- Kerjan. (18.Cherest H. Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5366-5374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the restricted pTRC 99A vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to yield the expression vector pSEC (Fig. 1). The PCR product of CBS was designed using an upstream PCR primer (5′-pATGACTAAATCTGAGCAGCAGCAAGCC-3′), which starts the 5′-phosphorylated ATG, and a downstream PCR primer (5′-GTTTGCTTTTATCTGCAGCGTGGG-3′), which extends from 8 to 31 bases after the termination codon for the CBS open reading frame. The boldface bases are changes that introduce aPstI restriction site. PCR reactions were carried out in 50 μl with 2-min denaturation at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles of 1-min denaturation at 94 °C, 30-s annealing at 50 °C, and 1-min extension at 72 °C using Pfu DNA polymerase and the reaction conditions described in the Stratagene catalog. The ethanol-precipitated PCR products were solubilized with TE buffer, pH 8.0 (10 mm Tris-HCl containing 1 mm EDTA), restricted by PstI (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and isolated by 0.7% agarose (Life Technologies, Inc., Ultra Pure) gel electrophoresis. The putative 1.5 kb CBS gene was cut out of the gel and extracted using a Geneclean II kit (Bio 101, Inc.). The overexpression vector pTrc 99A was restricted by NcoI, mung-bean nuclease (19.Hasan N. Kim S.C. Podhajska A.J. Szybalski W. Gene. 1986; 50: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and then by PstI. After each restriction step, the 4.2-kb product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and extraction as described above. The restricted pTrc 99A vector was ligated with the amplified CBS PCR product using T4 DNA ligase and transformed into host E. coli DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.). The seven-base distance between the AGGA site (E. coli ribosome binding site) of pTrc99A and the CBS start codon gives a high yield of overexpression. Recombinant pSEC was isolated using a QIA plasmid kit (Qiagen), and the total DNA sequence of the 1.5-kb insert was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (Biopolymer Core Facility, University of Maryland at Baltimore). Finally, pSEC was transformed into E. coli XL1-blue (Stratagene) for overexpression. Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie Blue protein assay reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard or from the specific absorbance of purified CBS at 280 nm (A 280 0.1% = 0.94). 4K.-H. Jhee, P. McPhie, and E. W. Miles, manuscript in preparation. CBS activity was determined by a modification of a standard method (20.Kraus J. Packman S. Fowler B. Rosenberg L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6523-6528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture, which contained 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 20 μm PLP, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mml-[U-14C]serine (800 cpm/nmol), and CBS (0.02–0.1 μg) in 18 μl, was preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding 2 μl of 50 mmhomocysteine to 5 mm and was terminated after 10–15 min by adding 5 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid. After the mixture was centrifuged for 3 min, 5 μl of the supernatant was applied to a cellulose thin layer chromatography plate (Kodak). The product,l-[14C]cystathionine, was separated froml-[14C]serine by ascending thin layer chromatography in 2-propanol/formic acid/H20 (80/6/20 v/v). Radioactivity of the product was determined by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). One unit of activity is defined as the production of 1 μmol of l-cystathionine/h at 37 °C. A 1-liter culture ofE. coli XL1-blue transformed with pSEC was grown at 37 °C in Super Broth (BioWhittaker or KD Medical) containing tryptone (12 g/liter), yeast extract (24 g/liter), glycerol (6.3 g/liter), K2HPO4 (12.5 g/liter), KH2PO4 (3.8 g/liter), δ-aminolevulinic acid (50 mg/liter), ampicillin (100 mg/liter), and 20 ml of 50-fold concentrated Vogel and Bonner minimal medium (21.Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 10% inoculum was added to the medium, and growth proceeded for ∼3–4 h until the OD650 reached 2.5. IPTG was added to 0.1 mm, and growth was continued at 30 °C for 14–18 h. We found that adding IPTG to cells at high density (OD650 = 2.5) gave a higher yield of enzyme than adding IPTG to cells at lower density. Growth in triple-indented Tunair flasks with loose fitting plastic caps (Shelton Scientific Manufacturing, Inc.) (22.Tunac J.B. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1989; 68: 157-159Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) gave the highest yield of cells. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 0.85% NaCl containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, resuspended in Buffer BP (50 mm sodium/bicine, pH 7.8, containing 10 mmEDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PLP, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm TLCK, 0.1 mm TPCK, 1 mg/liter aprotinin, 2 mg/liter leupeptin, 2 mg/liter pepstatin, and 1 mm benzamidine-HCl), and disrupted by passaging twice through a French press at 8,000 p.s.i. The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (crude extract) had a specific activity of 253 units/mg. Eight ml of a 2% solution of protamine sulfate in Buffer BP was added dropwise to the 50-ml crude extract with stirring at room temperature followed by additional stirring for 20 min. The suspension was centrifuged, and the precipitate was discarded. The supernatant solution was fractionated with ammonium sulfate at pH 7.5. The 30–60% ammonium sulfate fraction was dialyzed against three changes of Buffer BP at 4 °C for 6 h. The dialyzed enzyme solution (42 ml) was loaded onto a 2.5 × 20-cm column of DEAE-Sephacel, which was then washed with 300 ml of Buffer BP. The enzyme was eluted with a 1-liter linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in Buffer BP. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by activity assay. The active fractions, which eluted between 0.18–0.25 m NaCl, were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against Buffer KP (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, containing 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PLP, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm TLCK, 0.1 mm TPCK, 1 ml/liter aprotinin, 2 mg/liter leupeptin, 2 mg/liter pepstatin, and 1 mmbenzamidine-HCl at pH 7.8). The dialyzed DEAE fractions had a specific activity of 438 units/mg (yield = 64%). The dialyzed enzyme solution (40 ml) was applied to a Gigapite column (3.1 × 27 cm) equilibrated with Buffer KP. Gigapite is a modified form of hydroxyapatite that has large particles and gives a high flow rate. The column was washed with 400 ml of Buffer KP followed by 300 ml of Buffer KP that contained 50 mm potassium phosphate. The enzyme was eluted with a 1.8-liter linear gradient ranging from 50 to 400 mm potassium phosphate in Buffer KP. The active fractions, which eluted at 150–200 mm potassium phosphate, were concentrated to 10–30 mg/ml, dialyzed against Buffer K (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02 mm PLP), and stored at −85 °C. The Gigapite fractions had a specific activity of 470 units/mg (yield = 49%) and were >95% pure by the criterion of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Approximately 600 mg of homogenous CBS was obtained from a 1-liter culture. All procedures were completed within 72 h to limit proteolysis. Absorption spectra of CBS were made using a Hewlett Packard 8452-diode array spectrophotometer thermostatted at 25 °C by a Peltier junction temperature-controlled cuvette holder. CD measurements (mean residue ellipticity in degree cm2/dmol) were made at 25 °C in a Jasco J-715 spectrophotometer interfaced with a personal computer (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Easton, MD). Our new expression vector, pSEC (Fig.1), gave a very high level of expression of the yeast CBS gene in E. coli (see “Experimental Procedures”). A 2-fold purification of yeast CBS by DEAE-Sephacel and Gigapite chromatography yielded homogeneous CBS in approximately 50% yield. Although yeast CBS has been purified previously (13.Ono B. Kijima K. Inoue T. Miyoshi S. Matsuda A. Shinoda S. Yeast. 1994; 10: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the absorption spectrum was not reported.2 The absorption spectrum of our purified yeast CBS (Fig.2 A) exhibited major peaks at 280 and 412 nm in a ratio of 1: 0.16, typical of a PLP enzyme (15.Miles, E. W. (1986) in Pyridoxal Phosphate: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects (Dolphin, D., Poulson, D., and Avramovic, O., eds) Part B, Vol. 1, pp. 253–310, John Wiley and Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Removal of the PLP resulted in an apoenzyme having no absorbance in the visible range.4 In contrast, the absorption spectra of rat and human CBS (10.Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25283-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12.Kery V.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) exhibit a visible absorption band at 428 nm, which is approximately equal in intensity to the 280 nm absorption band. The 428 nm band in rat and human CBS is attributed to the presence of both heme and PLP, which have overlapping visible absorption spectra in the 410–430 nm region. The absence of heme in yeast CBS is not due to expression in E. coli; human CBS expressed in E. coli does contain heme. We added δ-aminolevulinate to theE. coli growth medium because the presence of this precursor of heme has been shown to increase the heme content of human CBS (27.Kery V. Elleder D. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The presence of heme in rat and human CBS is surprising because no other PLP enzyme has been reported to contain heme. Several PLP enzymes that catalyze β-elimination and β-replacement reactions exhibit a sequence similarity to rat, human, and yeast CBS (28.Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Three of these related enzymes, O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (29.Burkhard P. Rao G.S.J. Hohenester E. Schnackerz K.D. Cook P.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the β-subunit of tryptophan synthase (30.Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and threonine deaminase (31.Gallagher D.T. Gilliland G.L. Xiao G. Zondlo J. Fisher K.E. Chinchilla D. Eisenstein E. Structure. 1998; 6: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), have been analyzed by x-ray crystallography and shown to exhibit structural similarity. The spectroscopic properties of PLP provide a sensitive probe for detecting chemical intermediates in PLP-dependent β-replacement reactions (Scheme FS1) (15.Miles, E. W. (1986) in Pyridoxal Phosphate: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects (Dolphin, D., Poulson, D., and Avramovic, O., eds) Part B, Vol. 1, pp. 253–310, John Wiley and Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar) and in other PLP-dependent reactions. The absence of heme in yeast CBS facilitates spectroscopic studies to detect intermediates in the reactions of CBS and to probe the reaction mechanism. The addition of l-serine to yeast CBS resulted in the disappearance of the 412 nm band attributed to the internal aldimine (E in Scheme FS1) and the appearance of a new spectroscopic species with a major band centered at 460 nm and a shoulder at 330 nm (Fig. 2 A). The 460 nm band is likely due to the aldimine of aminoacrylate (E-AA in Scheme FS1), which has been detected in the reaction of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase withO-acetyl-l-serine (32.Cook P.F. Wedding R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2023-2029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Cook P.F. Hara S. Nalabolu S. Schnackerz K.D.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4776-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and ofd-serine dehydratase with d-serine (35.Schnackerz K.D. Ehrlich J.H. Giesemann W. Reed T.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The 330 nm shoulder may be due to a different tautomer of E-AA, which is the predominant intermediate in the reaction of the closely related tryptophan synthase with l-serine (36.Drewe W.J. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3977-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our results (Fig.2 A) demonstrate the E-AA intermediate by direct absorption spectroscopy for the first time. Previous studies of the reaction of truncated or full-length human CBS with l-serine detected a putative aminoacrylate intermediate by difference absorption spectroscopy (12.Kery V. Poneleit L. Meyer J.D. Manning M.C. Kraus J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2716-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or by fluorescence spectroscopy (fluorescence emission at ∼400 nm with excitation at 330 nm) (11.Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Rapid scanning spectroscopy may be needed to detect the external aldimine intermediate (E-Ser in Scheme FS1) in the reaction of CBS withl-serine or intermediates in the reaction of CBS withl-serine and l-homocysteine. The addition ofl-homocysteine to CBS in the presence ofl-serine under the conditions shown in Fig. 2 Aresulted in a transient decrease in absorbance at 460 nm (data not shown), providing additional evidence that the 460 nm band is due to the E-AA intermediate. The reaction of the substrate analogl-alanine with yeast CBS yielded a band at 420 nm, which is a wavelength characteristic of the expected external aldimine, E-Ala (15.Miles, E. W. (1986) in Pyridoxal Phosphate: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects (Dolphin, D., Poulson, D., and Avramovic, O., eds) Part B, Vol. 1, pp. 253–310, John Wiley and Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar). E-Ala is analogous to E-Ser in Scheme FS1. Yeast CBS exhibited a positive CD band centered in the visible absorption band of the cofactor at 412 nm (Fig. 1 B), as reported for O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (37.Schnackerz K.D. Tai C.H. Simmons 3rd, J.W. Jacobson T.M. Rao G.S. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12152-12160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and tryptophan synthase (38.Miles E.W. Moriguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6594-6599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Lane A.N. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 129: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The addition of l-serine gave a negative CD band centered at 460 nm and a strong positive band at 280 nm. Negative visible CD bands for E-AA have been reported forO-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (37.Schnackerz K.D. Tai C.H. Simmons 3rd, J.W. Jacobson T.M. Rao G.S. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12152-12160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and tryptophan synthase (39.Lane A.N. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 129: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 40.Kayastha A.M. Sawa Y. Nagata S. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7618-7625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tryptophan synthase E-AA intermediate also has a strong positive band at 280 nm (40.Kayastha A.M. Sawa Y. Nagata S. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7618-7625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of l-alanine gave a negative CD band centered at 430 nm. To probe the reversibility of the postulated CBS reaction in Scheme I, we measured the absorption spectra (Fig.3 A) and CD spectra (Fig.3 B) of yeast CBS in the presence ofl-cystathionine. The initial (15 s) absorption spectrum showed a peak at 430 nm and a prominent shoulder at 460 nm. The absorbance at 460 nm decreased with time (inset, Fig.3 A). The CD spectrum (∼6 min) exhibited a negative band at 460 nm and positive bands at 400 and 280 nm. Thus,l-cystathionine appears to undergo the reverse reaction to form E-AA and an aldimine, either the internal aldimine, E, or an external aldimine, E-Ser or E-Cyst (Scheme FS1). Our results provide the first direct, spectroscopic evidence that the reaction catalyzed by yeast CBS proceeds through the postulated intermediates in Scheme I and that the reaction is at least partially reversible. The absorption spectrum in Fig. 2 A showed thatl-serine was largely or completely converted to E-AA in the absence of l-homocysteine. This result demonstrates that the CBS reaction does not proceed by direct displacement of the OH ofl-serine, as proposed by Braunstein and Goryachenkova (41.Braunstein A.E. Goryachenkova E.V. Adv. Enzymol. 1984; 56: 1-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results, therefore, resolve an old controversy over the mechanism of CBS (14.Borcsok E. Abeles R.H. Arch. Biochem.

Goryachenkova E.V. Adv.

Abeles R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The direct displacement mechanism of Braunstein and Goryachenkova (41.Braunstein A.E. Goryachenkova E.V. Adv. Enzymol. 1984; 56: 1-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was proposed to explain the inability of CBS to catalyze the conversion of l-serine to pyruvate and NH3 by a β-elimination reaction. Our data provide evidence that CBS, like the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, forms a stable, enzyme-bound E-AA intermediate that does not undergo hydrolysis or further reaction in the absence of an added nucleophile. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that yeast CBS is a heme-independent, PLP enzyme and have carried out initial spectroscopic studies that establish the overall catalytic mechanism. Work is in progress to investigate the reaction kinetics, domain composition, oligomeric structure, and substrate and nucleophile specificity of yeast CBS.4 The absence of heme in the functional yeast enzyme shows that heme is not essential for catalysis and suggests that heme does not play an essential catalytic role in the rat and human enzymes. The results are consistent with the absence of heme in the closely related enzymes O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, threonine deaminase, and tryptophan synthase."

Dephosphorylation is required for synaptic vesicle retrieval, suggesting that its phosphorylation affects its subcellular localization. An in vitro phospholipid binding assay was established that prevents lipid vesiculation and dynamin lipid insertion into the lipid. Dynamin I bound the phospholipid in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner, with an apparent affinity of 230 ± 51 nm. Optimal binding occurred with mixtures of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine of 1:3 with little binding to phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylserine alone. Phospholipid binding was abolished after dynamin I phosphorylation by PKC and was restored after dephosphorylation by calcineurin. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry revealed the phosphorylation site in PKCα-phosphorylated dynamin I as a single site at Ser-795, located near a binding site for the SH3 domain of p85, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. However, phosphorylation had no effect on dynamin binding to a bacterially expressed p85-SH3 domain. Thus, phosphorylation of dynamin I on Ser-795 prevents its association with phospholipid, providing a basis for the cytosolic localization of the minor pool of phospho-dynamin I that mediates synaptic vesicle retrieval in nerve terminals.

It functions in endocytosis by stimulated assembly as a helix around the neck of invaginating synaptic vesicles (1.Koenig J.H. Ikeda K. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3844-3860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Stowell M.H. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Dynamin can self-assemble as a series of rings in the absence of guanine nucleotide (3.Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), and helices form around phospholipid vesicles in vitro (4.Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) or around the neck of invaginating synaptic vesicles (5.Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The helices behave like a nanospring, with GTP hydrolysis producing an increase in the helix pitch, suggesting that endocytosis might occur by a nucleotide-dependent conformational change in dynamin that cleaves vesicles from the plasma membrane (2.Stowell M.H. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Dynamin I is also a phosphoprotein found in intact nerve terminals where it is apparently phosphorylated by PKC1 (6.Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21637-21644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is rapidly dephosphorylated by calcineurin on stimulation of endocytosis by depolarization and calcium influx (7.Liu J.P. Sim A.T.R. Robinson P.J. Science. 1994; 265: 970-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and blocking dephosphorylation prevents endocytosis in nerve terminals (8.Marks B. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 740-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It remains dephosphorylated during endocytosis of most vesicles and is rephosphorylated while endocytosis is completing (9.Robinson P.J. Liu J.P. Powell K.A. Fykse E.M. Südhof T.C. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 348-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore the phosphorylation of dynamin is not likely to play a role during endocytosis but is probably a priming step prior to endocytosis.Many of the proteins essential for endocytosis are constitutively phosphorylated in nerve terminals at rest and are coordinately dephosphorylated by calcineurin upon a burst of exocytosis and endocytosis. These “dephosphins” include dynamin I, amphiphysins I and II, synaptojanin, epsin and Eps15 (8.Marks B. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 740-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 10.Robinson P.J. Sontag J.-M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C.

In vitrodephosphorylation of rat brain extracts promotes the assembly of dynamin I, synaptojanin, amphiphysin, clathrin, and AP-2 into complexes (15.Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. DeCamilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation appears to regulate the association and dissociation cycle of the endocytic machinery. This suggests that the role of dynamin phosphorylation may be to either prevent inappropriate protein-protein interactions (15.Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. DeCamilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) or to keep dynamin away from sites of exocytosis until required for endocytosis (6.Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21637-21644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The precise role of the phosphorylation of dynamin has not been fully determined, but several biochemical correlates have been reported.In vitro phosphorylation by cPKC (the Ca2+-dependent PKC family comprising PKCα, -β, and -γ) stimulates the GTPase activity of dynamin I (10.Robinson P.J. Sontag J.-M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), promotes the formation of disulfide bonds and its assembly into a tetramer, and increases low affinity Ca2+ binding (16.Liu J.P. Zhang Q.-X. Baldwin G. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2074-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by a cyclin-dependent protein kinase, Cdc2, prevents dynamin association with microtubules in vitro(17.Hosoya H. Komatsu S. Shimizu T. Inagaki M. Ikegami M. Yazaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1127-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of dynamin I by an unidentified cytosolic kinase activity inhibits its binding to amphiphysin (15.Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. DeCamilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), although phospho-dynamin from intact nerve terminals is capable of binding to the SH3 domains of amphiphysins I and II (8.Marks B. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 740-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In none of these examples was the phosphorylation site identified, and it might differ for each protein kinase.Dynamin I is known to be phosphorylated exclusively on serine on a site within the C terminus by cPKC in vitro and by endogenous protein kinases in intact nerve terminals (10.Robinson P.J. Sontag J.-M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 18.Robinson P.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19.Liu J.P. Powell K.A. Südhof T.C. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21043-21050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospho-dynamin I has a subcellular localization restricted to the cytosolic fraction of intact nerve terminals, despite that greater than 90% of the dynamin I is membrane-associated (19.Liu J.P. Powell K.A. Südhof T.C. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21043-21050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the larger dynamin I pool that is associated with brain membranes or cytoskeleton cannot be phosphorylated in vitro by PKC until dynamin is extracted from the membranes (19.Liu J.P. Powell K.A. Südhof T.C. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21043-21050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that phosphorylation of dynamin I may be required to generate or maintain a cytosolic pool of tetrameric phospho-dynamin which associates with proteins required to target dynamin to sites of endocytosis following a dephosphorylation stimulus. There are examples where one consequence of phosphorylation of other peripheral membrane proteins such as myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, synapsin I, and spectrin is an inhibition of their binding to phospholipid and consequent release into the cytosol (20.Wang J.K.

Bossi M. Fesce R. Greengard P. Valtorta F. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1143-1153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, in the case of dynamin I this concept has not been directly tested. Therefore our aims were to examine the consequences of phosphorylation by PKC on phospholipid binding by dynamin I and to determine the phosphorylation site sequence.RESULTSTo measure phospholipid-binding of dynamin I a plate-based assay was developed. The use of lipid-coated plastic or glass beads prevents insertion of dynamin into a lipid bilayer (19.Liu J.P. Powell K.A. Südhof T.C. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21043-21050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Ando Y. Imamura S. Hong Y.M. Owada M.K. Kakunaga T. Kannagi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6948-6955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and prevents dynamin from assembling as helices or vesiculating the phospholipid (4.Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), which would otherwise confound interpretation of phospholipid association. In background experiments to develop the method, the relative affinity of dynamin I for different compositions of phospholipid was assessed (Fig.1 A). Coating solutions were prepared from mixtures of two phospholipids with a fixed total concentration of phospholipid but with varying ratios. Dynamin I binding was greatest to a mixture of PS and PC and was reduced in mixtures of PI and PC or PS and PI. Dynamin I did not bind well to plates coated with any of the three individual phospholipids (data not shown). The highest binding level was achieved with a PS/PC ratio of 1:3. These conditions also best reflect the in vivosituation in regards to membrane lipid composition in cells and were used for all other experiments. In previous studies dynamin was found to dissociate from lipid-coated beads or rat brain membranes with NaCl (19.Liu J.P. Powell K.A. Südhof T.C. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21043-21050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that NaCl also efficiently blocked dynamin I association with phospholipid in the plate assay (Fig. 1 B). To demonstrate that binding was specific, we increased the detergent concentration in the assay to 1% Tween 80, which almost abolished dynamin binding (Fig. 1 C). As dynamin I concentrations were increased, it bound to the phospholipid-coated plates in a linear and saturable manner (Fig. 1 C). The calculated apparent affinity of dynamin for the phospholipid mixture using double-reciprocal plots was 230 ± 51 nm (n = 3).To determine if the plate binding assay sensitively detects alterations in the conformational status of dynamin, we next explored the effect of adenine and guanine nucleotides on dynamin binding to phospholipids (Fig. 2). Metal ions such as Mg2+ (Fig. 2 A) and Mn2+ (data not shown) had no effect on dynamin binding to phospholipid, whereas Ca2+ had variable effects at concentrations above 200 μm (data not shown). Mg2+ was included in equimolar concentrations with each guanine or adenine nucleotide. GTP potently reduced dynamin association with phospholipid (Fig.2 A). Other nucleotides also reduced binding but with greatly reduced efficacy. Concentrations producing 50% inhibition of binding (IC50) were 0.30 mm for GTP, and 2.5, 4.3, and 14 mm for GDP, GMP, and cGMP respectively. This suggests specificity in the action of GTP, as 0.3 mm is close to the physiological concentration of GTP in cells (30.Otero A.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1399-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To determine whether GTP binding or GTP hydrolysis was responsible for the reduced binding, two non-hydrolyzable GTP analogues were used, and both potently reduced the ability of dynamin I to bind to phospholipid (Fig. 2 B). GTPγS had a very similar response to GTP, and GMP-PNP was less potent. IC50 values for the analogues were 0.35 mm (Mg/GTPγS and 0.9 mm (Mg/GMP-PNP). This demonstrates that the effect of nucleotides on dynamin I binding to phospholipid is a consequence of GTP binding, rather than GTP hydrolysis. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with ATP and its analogues, except that the potency of all adenine nucleotides was much less than guanine nucleotide analogues (Fig. 2, C andD). The IC50 values were (in mm) ATP 2.0, ADP 5.1, AMP 9.5, ATPγS 2.9, and AMP-PNP 4.8.Figure 2Effect of guanine or adenine nucleotides on dynamin I binding to phospholipid. A, the effect of guanine nucleotides. The phospholipid-binding plate assay was performed in wells coated with PS/PC at 1:3 and in the presence of 0.8 μg/well dynamin I, with the addition of increasing concentrations of Mg2+ alone (filled circles) or Mg2+with GTP (open circles), GDP (open squares), GMP (open triangles), or cGMP (open diamonds).

Binding of non-phosphorylated dynamin I to phospholipid-coated plates increased in a linear manner, whereas phosphorylated dynamin I essentially failed to bind (Fig. 3). Some minor binding was achieved with the phosphorylated preparation as the concentration of dynamin was increased, the amount of which varied between different preparations of purified dynamin I. This variability might result from different amounts of phospho-dynamin contaminating each preparation of the protein. Phosphorylation of dynamin I was confirmed by either inclusion of [γ-32P]ATP in some experiments and autoradiography or by the ability of phosphorylated dynamin I to form tetramers in non-reducing SDS gels (16.Liu J.P. Zhang Q.-X. Baldwin G. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2074-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Addition of sodium chloride abolished binding of non-phosphorylated dynamin I to phospholipid but had no effect on the lack of binding by phosphorylated dynamin I (data not shown). To confirm that the in vitro effect of cPKC is mimicked in intact neurons by the endogenous dynamin I kinase, phospho-dynamin I was purified from rat brain. This form of dynamin eluted much earlier in a salt gradient from the Q-Sepharose column (data not shown) and was confirmed to be phosphorylated by its assembly as a disulfide-linked tetramer (16.Liu J.P. Zhang Q.-X. Baldwin G. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2074-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and elevated intrinsic GTPase activity (10.Robinson P.J. Sontag J.-M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This preparation of in vivo phospho-dynamin I also completely failed to associate with phospholipid in this assay (data not shown).Figure 3Phosphorylation of dynamin I (Dyn I) by PKC abolishes its ability to bind to phospholipid in the phospholipid-binding plate assay. Purified dynamin I was phosphorylated in vitro using cPKC and its appropriate substrates and co-factors and was repurified. A concentration-response curve was generated using either phosphorylated dynamin I (squares) or dynamin I from the same purification that had not been phosphorylated but had been repurified in parallel with the phosphorylated protein (circles). Results have had the blank (no dynamin I) subtracted and are from three experiments anderror bars indicate S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify that phosphorylation abolishes phospholipid binding by dynamin I, we employed a distinct phospholipid binding assay that also does not allow dynamin insertion into bilayers nor vesiculation of the lipid. Dynamin I strongly associates with phospholipid-coated CPG beads in a centrifugation-based assay (19.Liu J.P. Powell K.A. Südhof T.C. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21043-21050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the effect of phosphorylation, dynamin I was phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant PKCα (Fig. 4) or cPKC (data not shown), repurified, and incubated with the phospholipid-coated CPG beads. Phosphorylated dynamin showed reduced binding to phospholipids (lanes 3 and 4). As a control, dynamin was also phosphorylated by CK2, which is known not to affect its GTPase activity (10.Robinson P.J. Sontag J.-M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). CK2-phosphorylation did not affect its ability to associate with phospholipid (lanes 5 and 6).Figure 4Binding of dynamin I to phospholipid-coated controlled-pore glass beads is reduced by phosphorylation.Purified dynamin I (1.0 μg) was phosphorylated with cPKC (lanes 3 and 4) or CK2 (lanes 5 and 6) and repurified. Non-phosphorylated (lanes 1 and2) and phosphorylated dynamin I were mixed with phospholipid-coated CPG beads for 30 min. Samples were separated into supernatant (S) or pellet (P) fractions by brief centrifugation and applied to SDS-PAGE (7.5–15% gradient acrylamide gels), and the protein was stained with Coomassie Blue. The same results were obtained in a second, independent experiment.Ctrl, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the ability of dynamin I to bind phospholipid could be restored by its dephosphorylation, a preparation of dynamin I was phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATPin vitro and then dephosphorylated by addition of the purified protein phosphatase, calcineurin. The dynamin phosphorylation status was monitored by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig.5, A and B). Dynamin I was efficiently dephosphorylated by 0.75 μg of calcineurin (lane 3). Phosphorylated dynamin I was then incubated with 0.15 μg or 0.75 μg of calcineurin in the presence of calmodulin, Mn2+, and Ca2+ (activators of calcineurin). Neither divalent cation affected the binding of dynamin I to phospholipid in this assay system (Fig. 5 C). Increasing the concentration of calcineurin correspondingly increased dynamin I binding to the phospholipid. Controls showed that calcineurin and its activators had no effect on non-phosphorylated dynamin I binding to phospholipid (Fig. 5 C).Figure 5Dephosphorylation of dynamin I (Dyn I) restores phospholipid binding. Dynamin I was phosphorylated in vitro with cPKC and [γ-32P]ATP and was repurified. Dephosphorylation with calcineurin plus calmodulin (CaM), Ca2+, and Mn2+ was performed at 30 °C for 30 min, and samples were applied to SDS-PAGE for Coomassie staining (B) autoradiography (A) or were used in the phospholipid-binding plate assay (C).

C, dynamin or PKC-phosphorylated dynamin I (2.0 μg per well) were added to phospholipid-coated wells and incubated with the phosphatase calcineurin (0.15 or 0.75 μg) plus its activators (calmodulin, calcium, and manganese) for 30 min at 30 °C.

Three different approaches were used as follows: (i) identification of the phosphopeptide in the peptide mass map of the whole peptide mixture derived by tryptic digestion of dynamin I, before and after alkaline phosphatase treatment; (ii) identification of the phosphopeptides after affinity purification using an IMAC column, and (iii) identification of the phosphopeptides by MALDI MS of the radioactive fraction after high pressure liquid chromatography separation. The tryptic peptides of dynamin I and phosphorylated dynamin I were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, and the observed peptides were identified based on their predicted masses determined from the known sequence. Comparison of the peptide mass map of phosphorylated dynamin I and dynamin I revealed a single peptide of mass-over-charge ratio (m/z) of 1175.74 Da that was unique to dynamin I and was not found in phosphorylated dynamin I (data not shown). However, the corresponding phosphorylated peptide predicted at an m/z 1255.75 Da was not observed in the spectrum of the tryptic digest of the phosphorylated sample, probably due to suppression effects frequently observed in MALDI-TOF MS. Another peptide signal at m/z 1256.69 Da could be correlated to a peptide derived from trypsin (amino acids 4–14) (Fig.6 A). Treatment of the mixture with alkaline phosphatase resulted in a very weak peak atm/z 1175.74, indicating that the phosphorylated peptide might have been present (data not shown). To demonstrate this, the phosphopeptides in the tryptic digest of phosphorylated dynamin I were selectively purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Fe3+-charged nitrilotriacetic acid resin and were desalted prior to MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 6 B). A major mass peak at m/z 1255.74 Da was found, accompanied by a characteristic metastable fragment ion, diagnostic of the loss of H3PO4 by post-source decay in the first field free region in the MALDI (Fig. 6 B). A minor peak atm/z 1411.86 Da was also observed, with its accompanying fragment ion, corresponding to alternative tryptic cleavage after Arg-694 instead of Arg-695. To confirm further that these peptides were indeed phosphorylated, they were dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase directly on the MALDI target, resulting in a mass shift of −80 Da to m/z 1175.75 Da concomitant with the disappearance of the metastable species (Fig. 6 C). This mass corresponds to the dynamin 785–796 fragment APAVPPARPGSR, which contains a single serine at Ser-795. In the experiment shown in Fig. 6 B, them/z 1411.86-Da peptide (B) did not appear atm/z 1331.86 Da (C) probably due to its low abundance. However, a weak signal corresponding to this peptide was detected in two additional experiments (data not shown). Furthermore, a radioactively labeled peak detected by high pressure liquid chromatography was found by MALDI-TOF MS to represent them/z 1255.74-Da peptide, accompanied by the metastable fragment ion signal. This peak shifted to m/z 1175.74 Da after alkaline phosphatase treatment. Since we previously demonstrated that dynamin I is exclusively phosphorylated on serine residues by PKC (10.Robinson P.J.

A, dynamin I was phosphorylated with recombinant PKCα, digested with trypsin, and the digest subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The mass of each peak is indicated in Da.B, the same digest was subjected to micro-purification on IMAC followed by R3 to purify the phosphopeptides. Only two peaks (1255.79 and 1411.86 Da) and peaks corresponding to their metastable loss of H3PO4 were detected. Both masses represented two cleavage variants derived from the same sequence stretch (the amino acid sequence is shown), separated only by the mass of a single arginine residue. C, the samples fromB were incubated on the sample plate (on-target) with alkaline phosphatase and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS again.

Using the polymerase chain reaction, we isolated a cDNA encoding a novel shorter form of Ang2 from human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA and have designated it angiopoietin-2443 (Ang2443), because it contains 443 amino acids. Part of the coiled-coil domain (amino acids 96–148) is absent in Ang2443 because of alternative splicing of the gene. Like Ang2, recombinant Ang2443expressed in COS-7 cells is secreted as a glycosylated homodimeric protein. Recombinant Ang2443 binds to the Tie2 receptor but does not induce Tie2 phosphorylation. Pre-occupation of Ang2443 on Tie2 inhibits Ang1 or Ang2 binding and inhibits Ang1-induced phosphorylation. Expression ofAng2 443 mRNA is detectable in primary endothelial cells, several nonendothelial tumor cell lines, and primary tumor tissues. Interestingly, two cervical carcinoma cell lines express relatively moderate levels of Ang2 443 mRNA and protein. Macrophages express mainly Ang2 mRNA, but the expression of Ang2 443 mRNA is temporarily up-regulated during macrophage differentiation. These results suggest that Ang2443 is a functional antagonist of Ang1 and could be an important regulator of angiogenesis during some tumorigenic and inflammatory processes.

In this study, we isolated a cDNA encoding a novel alternatively spliced form of Ang2 from human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cDNA and have designated it angiopoietin-2443 (Ang2 443). We examined its biochemical nature and mRNA distribution. Our findings suggest that Ang2443 is a secreted homodimeric glycoprotein, and it may act as a functional antagonist of Ang1 in the regulation of angiogenesis in tumor and inflammatory cells. Human HUVEC cDNA were amplified by PCR with specific primers forAng2 (sense 5′-GCTGCTGGTTTATTACTGAAGAA-3′ (bp −26 to −4) and antisense 5′-TCAGGTGGACTGGGATGTTTAG-3′ (bp 1488–1509)). These primers span the entire coding region of Ang2. Each of the 30 PCR amplification cycles consisted of: 30 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 60 °C, and 150 s at 72 °C. The PCR products were separated on 0.8% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. We observed both the expected size and a smaller DNA band. Both bands were subcloned into the pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen) and were sequenced. We PCR-amplified the 5′-region ofAng2 using the Human Genome Walker kit (CLONTECH) as the template. To amplify intron-exon boundaries, two sets of primers (sense, 5′-GAACATCATGGAAAACAACACTCA-3′ (bp 252–275); antisense, 5′-CAGGGACACCGTGTGCTTTATGTGGC-3′ (intron) and sense, 5′-GCAAACGCGGAAGTTAACTGATGT-3′ (bp 411–434); antisense, 5′-CTGAAGTTCAAGTCTCGTGGTCT-3′ (bp 455–477)) were used. The amplified PCR products (0.5 and 1.4 kb) were subcloned into the pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen). The intron-exon boundaries and the length of the shorter intron were determined by nucleotide sequence analysis. The length of larger intron was calculated based on the length of the amplified PCR fragment. Human Ang1, Ang2, and the shorterAng2 DNA were inserted into the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven mammalian cell expression vector, pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen). This vector contains a 63-base pair c-Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) and a His6 tag (HHHHHH) as open reading frames at the 3′-end of the coding region. Each gene construct was transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated at 37.5 °C for 72 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) were added to the culture supernatant of the COS-7 cells to purify the recombinant proteins. All buffers contained 0.05% CHAPS during protein purification and reconstitution. The binding protein was eluted with pH 8.0 buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Eluates were dialyzed extensively against TBS buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and were concentrated using Centricon 10 (Amicon) at 4 °C. The salts were removed using a desalting column and the proteins were reconstituted with TBS buffer. Approximately 10 μg of each recombinant protein was obtained. The purity of the proteins was determined by silver-stained SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes under nonreducing or reducing conditions and detected by Western blot analysis with anti-Myc antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The signals were visualized by chemiluminescent detection according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The glycosylation status of the recombinant Ang2 and Ang2443proteins was determined with PNGase-F treatment according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). The secreted extracellular domains of the Tie1 and Tie2 receptors were produced using pFLAG cytomegalovirus-1 vector (Eastman Kodak Co.), which has a preprotrypsin leader sequence for secretion of the fusion protein (8.Kim I. Moon S.-O. Koh K.N. Kim H. Uhm C.-S. Kwak H.J. Kim N.-G. Koh G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26523-26528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These fusion proteins were designated pFLAG-eTie1 and pFLAG-eTie2. Anti-FLAG M1 affinity gel (Kodak) was used to hold pFLAG-eTie1 or pFLAG-eTie2 protein. The gels were washed with binding buffer (50 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and the recombinant Ang2 or Ang2443 was added to this gel. One hour after incubation, control buffer or Ang1 was added to the gels. After a 1-h incubation, the gels were cleared with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween-20). The gels were boiled with sample buffer, and the samples were separated by 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE. Anti-FLAG-M2 antibody was used to detect the binding of the pFLAG-eTie1 and pFLAG-eTie2 proteins. Anti-Myc antibody was used to detect the binding of Ang2 or Ang2443. HUVECs were seeded to 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 104cells/cm2 and were grown in M-199 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for 24 h. After 24 h of serum deprivation, the medium was changed to serum-free M-199. Ang1, Ang2, or Ang2443 was added to the cells at the indicated amounts, and the cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were homogenized in Nonidet P-40 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml 1-chloro-3-toxylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/mll-1-tosylamino-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40). After centrifugation, protein in the clear lysate was measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Cell lysates were diluted to 1 ml with radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 mTris, pH 7.4), and were pre-cleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (0.15 g/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins were incubated with anti-Tie2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. Antibody complexes were recovered on protein A-Sepharose beads, washed three times with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer, dissolved in sample buffer, boiled, and separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylation status of Tie2 was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (UBI) or anti-Tie2 antibody as described above. HUVECs were prepared from human umbilical cords by collagenase digestion as described previously (7.Kim I. Kwak H.J. Ahn J.E. So J.-N. Liu M. Koh K.N. Koh G.Y.

Lung macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavage of bronchial asthma patients were cultured in RPMI medium. Cell lines used in this study were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea). Of these, HUVECs, C33A, and CaSki cells were maintained in M199 medium supplemented with 10% serum and harvested at 80–90% confluence. Macrophage precursor cells, THP-1, were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% serum and were differentiated by the addition of vitamin D3 (10−8m) as described (9.Schwende H. Fitzke E. Ambs P. Dieter P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The differentiation state was analyzed by microscopic observation and detection of mRNA of the type B scavenger receptor, CD36 (10.Alessio M. De Monte L. Scirea A. Gruarin P. Tandon N.N. Sitia R. J.

Samples from cancerous and adjacent normal tissue areas were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until RNA extraction. RNAs from cells and tissues were extracted using Tri-Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (MRC, Inc.). Samples of total RNA (100 ng) were suspended in 100 μl of RT buffer. The reaction mixtures were reverse-transcribed at room temperature for 10 min and at 42 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by heat inactivation, and the cDNA products were amplified by PCR with specific internal primers for Ang2 (sense 5′-CAGAGGCTGCAAGTGCTGGAGAACA-3′ (bp 232–256) and antisense 5′-GAGGGAGTGTTCCAAGAGCTGAAGT-3′ (bp 471–495)). Each of the 30 PCR amplification cycles consisted of: 10 s at 94 °C and 60 s at 68 °C. The RT-PCR products of Ang2 (263 bp) andAng2 443 (104 bp) were confirmed by Southern blot analysis with a 32P-labeled Ang2 cDNA probe (bp 74–424) using standard procedures. For a quantification ofAng2 and Ang2 443 mRNA expression using an internal control, the cDNA products were amplified by PCR with specific primers for Ang2 (sense 5′-GCTGCTGGTTTATTACTGAAGAA-3′ (bp −26 to −4) and antisense 5′-TCAGGTGGACTGGGATGTTTAG-3′ (bp 1488–1509)) andβ-actin (sense 5′-ATCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG-3′ (bp 253–284) and antisense 5′-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC-3′ (bp 1059–1090)). Each of the 25 PCR amplification cycles consisted of: 10 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 90 s at 68 °C. For a quantification ofCD36 mRNA expression with an internal control in THP-1 cells, the cDNA products were amplified by PCR with specific primers for CD36 (sense 5′- CTGGCTGTGTTTGGAGGTATTCTA-3′ (bp 265–288) and antisense 5′-CCATCTGCAGTATTGTTGTAAGGA-3′ (bp 816–839)) and β-actin. Each of the 26 PCR amplification cycles consisted of: 10 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 62 °C, and 30 s at 68 °C. All PCR products were separated on agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Ang2 cDNA spanning the splice region (bp 287–565) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pBluescript II KS+ as a DNA template (Stratagene) for RNA synthesis. After linearizing with XhoI, 32P-labeled antisense RNA probes (∼280 bases) were synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase (Ambion Maxiscript kit) and gel-purified. RPA was performed with total RNAs using the Ambion RPA kit. An RPA using cyclophilin as a probe was carried out for RNA quantification. Polyclonal anti-Ang2 antibody was produced by immunization of rabbits using standard methods. In brief, cDNA encoding the mid-portion of Ang2 (amino acids, 142–275) was inserted in the correct open reading frame into glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein expression vector, pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The expression of the protein was induced in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyld-thiogalactopyranoside, and the protein was purified using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. The glutathioneS-transferase protein was removed by thrombin treatment. The purified protein was mixed with an equal volume of complete or incomplete Freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into the back neck area of a rabbit for initial and booster injections. For Western blot analysis, samples were mixed with sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked by incubation in blocking buffer, incubated with anti-Ang2 polyclonal antibody, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Signals were visualized by chemiluminescent detection according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was reblotted with anti-actin antibody (Sigma) to verify equal loading of protein in each lane. PCR on HUVEC cDNA with specific primers for Ang2 revealed both a major band of the expected size (1491 base pairs) and a smaller less abundant band (∼1330 base pairs). The smaller Ang2cDNA encodes a 443-amino acid polypeptide, whereas the majorAng2 cDNA encodes a 496-amino acid polypeptide (Fig.1 A). We designated this smaller Ang2 as Ang2 443. The alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of Ang2443with Ang2 revealed that a part of the coiled-coil domain (amino acids, 96–148) in the amino-terminal region of Ang2 is absent in Ang2443. To investigate the possibility that Ang2443 is generated by an alternative splicing, we determined the structure of the corresponding human genomic DNA. The putative exonB of human Ang2 is absent inAng2 443 (Fig. 1 B). The nucleotide sequences of the intron-exon junctions contained a canonical splice donor and acceptor sequences (Fig. 1 C). Thus,Ang2 443 is a splice variant of theAng2 gene. The amino acid sequence of human Ang2 has a highly hydrophobic region at the NH2 terminus (∼20 amino acids) that is typical of a signal sequence for protein secretion (Fig.1 A). The signal sequence cleavage site is predicted to lie between Asn19 and Asn20, using the method of von Heijne (11.von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). The signal sequence is preserved in Ang2443. To demonstrate that Ang2443 is a secreted protein, COS-7 cells were transfected with a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven mammalian cell expression vector containing humanAng2 or Ang2 443 cDNA with a 3′-terminal extension encoding a c-Myc tag and 6-histidine tag. To detect the Ang2 or Ang2443 protein, both the culture medium and cell lysates were examined by Western blot analysis with an anti-Myc antibody. A major Ang2 band of ∼68 kDa or a major Ang2443 band of ∼61 kDa was detected in the culture medium but was not detected in the cell lysate (Fig.2 A). The observed molecular masses of these bands were larger than their calculated molecular masses (56.9 and 50.8 kDa). The amino acid sequence of Ang2 contained several potential glycosylation sites (at amino acids 89, 119, 133, 151, 240, and 304), suggesting that Ang2443, like Ang2, may be a glycoprotein. Therefore, the recombinant Ang2 and Ang2443 were treated with PNGase-F (Fig. 2 B). Deglycosylation reduced the apparent molecular mass of recombinant Ang2 from ∼68 kDa to the predicted 56.9 kDa and Ang2443 from ∼61 kDa to the predicted 50.8 kDa (Fig. 2 B). A recent report showed that Ang2 exists predominantly as a homodimer (12.Procopio W.N. Pelavin P.I. Lee W.M.F. Yeilding N.M. J. Biol.

We examined whether Ang2 and Ang2443 were present as homodimers by Western blot analyses of Ang2 and Ang2443under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2 C). Both Ang2 and Ang2443 produce two major bands of the molecular masses expected for homodimeric and monomeric forms (∼160 and ∼80 kDa for Ang2 and ∼140 and ∼70 kDa for Ang2443). These results indicate that our recombinant Ang2443 from transfected COS-7 cells is an efficiently secreted homodimeric glycoprotein. Ang1 and Ang2 bind to the Tie2 receptor with similar affinity, but neither binds to the closely related receptor Tie1 (1.Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E.

Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2975) Google Scholar). We assayed the binding activity of Ang2443 with Tie1 and Tie2 by in vitroprotein-protein interaction. The secreted extracellular domain of Tie1 (pFLAG-eTie1, ∼96 kDa) or Tie2 (pFLAG-eTie2, ∼105 kDa) was bound to an anti-FLAG affinity gel (Fig.3 A). Recombinant Ang2443 or Ang2 bound to pFLAG-eTie2 but not to pFLAG-eTie1 (Figs. 3 A). Furthermore, pre-occupation of pFLAG-eTie2 with Ang2443 partially inhibited Ang2 or Ang1 binding (Fig.3 B). Conversely, pre-occupation of the receptor by Ang1 or Ang2 partially inhibited Ang2443 binding (data not shown). Previous experiments indicated that maximal Tie2 phosphorylation occurred 10 min after the addition of Ang1. In the present study, Ang1 (200 ng/ml) induced ∼16.5-fold in Tie2 phosphorylation compared with control buffer (Figs. 4, A andB). As expected, however, neither Ang2 (200 ng/ml) nor Ang2443 (200 ng/ml) induced the Tie2 phosphorylation. Pretreatment with 400 ng/ml of Ang2 or Ang2443 reduced ∼50–55% of the Ang1-induced Tie2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4,A and B). These results suggest that Ang2443, like Ang2, may be a functional antagonist of Ang1. We performed RT-PCR analyses using primers that lie outside the alternatively spliced region (Fig.5 A). Various human cells and tissues were assayed for alternate splicing of exon B (Fig.5 B). Primary endothelial cells expressed bothAng2 and Ang2 443 mRNAs (Fig.5 B). Tumor cell lines had various patterns ofAng2 and Ang2 443 mRNA expression. Interestingly, cervical carcinoma cell lines C33A and CaSki expressed only or mainly Ang2 443 mRNA. Highly vascularized tumor tissues, such as hemangioma, expressedAng2 443 mRNA along with abundant expression of Ang2 mRNA. In addition to abundant expression ofAng2 mRNA, Ang2 443 mRNA was also detectable in two of three cases of primary breast carcinoma; in contrast, only a trace of Ang2 mRNA, and noAng2 443 mRNA, was seen in the adjacent normal tissues. Primary cultured human lung macrophages expressed mainly Ang2 mRNA. We induced the differentiation of macrophage precursor cell line THP-1 by the addition of vitamin D3. The differentiation of these cells was evidenced by induction of CD36 mRNA expression (Fig. 5 C). Notably, the expression of Ang2 443 mRNA was up-regulated at 24 and 36 h of treatment, whereas the expression of Ang2 mRNA was not changed during differentiation (Fig. 5 C). As an internal control, theβ-actin mRNA expression was constant during THP-1 differentiation. Southern blot analysis confirmed the identities of the RT-PCR products of Ang2 (263 bp) and Ang2 443 (104 bp) from HUVECs, C33A, CaSki, and PLC/PRF5 cells (Fig. 5 D). However, it is possible that other splice variants, also lacking exon B, could produce a RT-PCR product of the same size asAng2 443. Therefore, sequence analyses were performed on the smaller RT-PCR product from all samples. All were identical to Ang2 443 (data not shown). In addition, we performed RT-PCR analyses using the primers that amplify the full sequences of Ang2 andAng2 443 along with internal control primers forβ-actin. RT-PCR products of the size expected for both Ang2 and Ang2 443 mRNA were present in HUVECs, C33A, and CaSki cells (Fig. 5 E). Sequence analyses indicated that the smaller product wasAng2 443 (data not shown). Densitometric analyses with β-actin mRNA expression as an internal control revealed that the expression ratio ofAng2 443 mRNA to Ang2 mRNA in HUVECs is approximately 0.09 (Fig. 5 E). We examined the relative expression of the Ang2 andAng2 443 mRNA transcripts and protein in HUVECs, C33A, and CaSki cells. Similar to the RT-PCR results, HUVECs expressed both Ang2 andAng2 443 mRNAs (Fig.6 A). Densitometric analyses revealed that the expression ratio of Ang2 443mRNA to Ang2 mRNA in HUVECs is ∼0.10–0.15. Although a moderate level of Ang2 protein was detectable in HUVECs, Ang2443 protein was not clearly detectable or distinguishable from Ang2 protein (Fig. 6 B). Small amounts of Ang2443 may be present, but may co-migrate with the abundant Ang2, thus being undistinguishable by Western blotting. Cervical carcinoma cell lines C33A and CaSki also expressed relatively moderate levels of Ang2 443 mRNA (Fig.6 A). Consistent with the RPA analyses, Ang2443protein was detected in C33A and CaSki cells (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that some nonendothelial cancer cells may synthesize Ang2443 protein. Here, we report the identification of a novel alternative splice variant of the human Ang2 gene and have designated it angiopoietin-2443 (Ang2 443). Part of the coiled-coil domain (amino acids 96–148) is absent in Ang2443 because of alternative splicing of the gene. Like Ang2, Ang2443 is a secreted, glycosylated, homodimeric protein. Ang2443 binds to the Tie2 receptor and does not induce phosphorylation of Tie2. Pre-occupation of Ang2443on Tie2 inhibits Ang1 or Ang2 binding and inhibits Ang1-induced phosphorylation. Expression of Ang2 443 mRNA is detectable in primary endothelial cells, several nonendothelial tumor cell lines, and primary tumor tissues. Macrophages express mainlyAng2 mRNA, but the expression ofAng2 443 is temporally up-regulated during macrophage differentiation. Therefore, we conclude that Ang2443 is a functional antagonist of Ang1 and could be an important regulator of angiogenesis during some tumorigenic and inflammatory processes. Ang2 has a typical angiopoietin structure containing a signal sequence for secretion, coiled-coil domains in the amino-terminal portion, and a fibrinogen-like domain in the carboxyl-terminal portion (2.Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Ang2443 lacks 53 amino acids in part of the coiled-coil domain of Ang2 as a result of alternative splicing. Recently, another splice variant of Ang2 was found in chicken testis and designated Ang-2B (13.Mezquita J. Mezquita B. Pau M. Mezquita C. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although Ang-2B has an intact fibrinogen domain, it lacks both the signal sequence for secretion and a part of the coiled-coil domain. Thus, Ang-2B is unlikely to be secreted and functionally active. In contrast to Ang-2B, Ang2443 has a signal sequence for secretion. Moreover, four of six potential glycosylation sites in Ang2 are conserved in Ang2443. Indeed, our results indicate that Ang2443 is a glycosylated secretory protein. A coiled-coil domain is involved in the assembly of multimeric structures (14.Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). In fact, a recent report indicates that Ang1 exists predominantly as a homomultimer, whereas Ang2 exists predominantly as a homodimer, held together by coiled-coil structures and disulfide cross-links (12.Procopio W.N. Pelavin P.I. Lee W.M.F. Yeilding N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30196-30201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Multimeric ligands are known to dimerize and activate their receptors upon ligand binding (14.Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that Ang2443exists as a homodimer even though its coiled-coil domain is partially deleted. Moreover, Ang2443 binds to the Tie2 receptor and inhibits the binding of either Ang2 or Ang1. In contrast to Ang1, which stimulates phosphorylation of Tie2, Ang2 fails to elicit this response (2.Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2975) Google Scholar, 12.Procopio W.N. Pelavin P.I. Lee W.M.F. Yeilding N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30196-30201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results show that Ang2 blocks Ang1-induced phosphorylation of the Tie2 receptor. This suggests that a natural role of Ang2 may be to antagonize Ang1-induced activation of Tie2. Our results indicate that Ang2443 does not phosphorylate Tie2. Furthermore, pretreatment with Ang2443 blocks Ang1-induced phosphorylation of the Tie2 receptor. Therefore, we conclude that Ang2443, like Ang2, could be a functional antagonist to Ang1 on the Tie2 receptor. Given that the Ang2 and Ang2443 are important regulators on the Tie2 receptor during angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, the analyses of expression patterns of Ang2 andAng2 443 mRNA in various cells and tissues shed some light on their potential functions. Primary endothelial cells express both Ang2 and Ang2 443mRNA transcripts with the expression ratio ofAng2 443 mRNA to Ang2 mRNA at ∼10%. Various human tumor cell lines and tissues expressAng2 and Ang2 443 mRNA at various levels, although very little Ang2 mRNA was expressed in the adjacent normal tissue. Consistent with these data, previous reports indicated that high levels of Ang2 mRNA are observed in highly vascularized glioblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (15.Stratmann A. Risau W. Plate K.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1459-1466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 16.Tanaka S. Mori M. Sakamoto Y. Makuuchi M. Sugimachi K. Wands J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In our analyses, several cancer cells expressAng2 and/or Ang2 443 mRNA. Notably, two cervical epithelial cell-derived cancer cell lines express only or mainly moderate levels of Ang2 443mRNA and protein. These results suggest that the main site ofAng2 expression is endothelial cells. However, some nonendothelial cells can express either Ang2 orAng2 443 mRNA and protein during tumorigenesis. Thus, Ang2443, like Ang2, could be a paracrine factor involved in vascular disruption as a functional antagonist to Ang1 during tumorigenesis. It is well known that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has five alternatively spliced isoforms in normal cells and tissues with VEGF165 being the predominant form (17.Veikkola T. Alitalo K. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 18.Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). Interestingly, VEGF145 is the major splice variant in several tumor cell lines originating from female reproductive tissue (19.Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Sivan R. Kandelis Y. Spira G. Vlodavsky I. Keshet E. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7151-7158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). VEGF145 binds to extracellular matrix but does not bind to neuropilin-1, whereas VEGF165 does not bind to extracellular matrix but does bind to neuropilin-1 (17.Veikkola T. Alitalo K. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 19.Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Sivan R. Kandelis Y. Spira G. Vlodavsky I. Keshet E. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7151-7158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Therefore, ongoing studies will examine the differential biochemical properties of Ang2 and Ang2443 Macrophages are among the most versatile cells and are involved in immune responses and inflammation. Macrophages are also key angiogenesis effector cells that produce a number of growth stimulators and inhibitors, proteolytic enzymes, and cytokines that can influence one or more steps in the angiogenesis cascade (20.Polverini P.J. Exper. Suppl. (Basel). 1997; 79: 11-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that primary cultured lung macrophages and precursor macrophage cell lines, THP-1, mainly express Ang2 mRNA. Thus, Ang2 secreted from infiltrated macrophage may be involved in vascular disruption during the inflammation process in a paracrine manner. Interestingly, Ang2 443 mRNA is temporally up-regulated in a way that coincides with maximum expression of CD36 in the macrophage precursor cell line THP-1 (monocytic leukemia cell lines) during differentiation. A previous report indicated that CD36 expression reaches peak levels in early macrophage stages and gradually decreases as macrophages mature (21.Huh H.Y. Pearce S.F. Yesner L.M. Schindler J.L. Silverstein R.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 2020-2028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, we found that the expression of Ang2 443 mRNA increases during the early stages of macrophage differentiation. CD36, a type B scavenger receptor, has been identified as a functional receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein and thrombospondin-1 in macrophages (21.Huh H.Y. Pearce S.F. Yesner L.M. Schindler J.L. Silverstein R.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 2020-2028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol.

Invest. 1987; 79: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Under certain conditions, increased CD36 expression during monocyte to macrophage differentiation in the arterial wall is actively involved in oxidized low density lipoprotein uptake and adhesiveness for foam cell formation and pathogenesis during atherosclerosis (24.Freeman M.W. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1997; 4: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25.Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M.

At that time, early macrophages have their maximum disruptive capacity to the vascular endothelium. The corresponding increased expression of Ang2443 may help to enhance this vascular disruption. In future studies, we will examine this possibility as we examine the exact roles of Ang2443 in the early stages of macrophage differentiation. In summary, we have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel splice variant of Ang2 from human HUVEC cDNA and have designated it Ang2443. Ang2443 is a secreted homodimeric glycoprotein and binds to the Tie2 receptor as an antagonist of Ang1-induced phosphorylation. Furthermore, Ang2443 may be an important regulator of angiogenesis in certain tumor and inflammatory processes. We thank Jennifer Macke for help in preparing the manuscript."

G., and MacLennan, D. H. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 26120–26126). In further investigations, this region was subdivided by the construction of new chimeras, and alterations in channel function were detected by measurement of the caffeine dependence of in vivo Ca2+ release and the Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding. Chimera RF10a (amino acids 4187–4381) had a lower EC50value for activation by caffeine, and RF10c (4557–4628) had a higher EC50 value, whereas the EC50 value for chimera RF10b (4382–4556) was unchanged. Chimeras RF10b and RF10c were more sensitive to activation by Ca2+, whereas RF10a was less sensitive to inactivation by Ca2+, implicating RF10b and RF10c in Ca2+ activation and RF10a in Ca2+inactivation. Deletion of much of divergent region 1 sequence to create mutant Δ4274–4535 led to higher caffeine and Ca2+sensitivity of channel activation and to lower Ca2+sensitivity for inactivation. Thus, deletion results demonstrate that caffeine, Ca2+, and ryanodine binding sites are not located in amino acids 4274–4535. Nevertheless, the properties of the deletion and chimeric mutants demonstrate that amino acids 4274–4535 and three shorter sequences in this region (F10a, amino acids 4187–4381; F10b, 4382–4556; and F10c, 4557–4628) in RyR1 modulate Ca2+ and caffeine sensitivity of the Ca2+ release channel. Replacement of amino acids 4187–4628 in the skeletal muscle Ca2+ release channel (skeletal ryanodine receptor (RyR1)), including nearly all of divergent region 1 (amino acids 4254–4631), with the corresponding cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) sequence leads to increased sensitivity of channel activation by caffeine and Ca2+ and to decreased sensitivity of channel inactivation by elevated Ca2+ (Du, G.

Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Despite these physiological differences, Ca2+ is a basic modulator of both RyR1 and RyR2. Both channels are also modulated by other endogenous and exogenous modulators, such as ATP, calmodulin, Mg2+, ruthenium red, and ryanodine, but the extent of modulation by Ca2+, ATP, Mg2+, and ruthenium red differs between RyR1 and RyR2 (3.Coronado R.

If different physiological functions and pharmacological properties could be correlated with different sequences, binding sites for modulating agents in RyR might be identified, leading to a better understanding of structure/function relationships within the molecule. Structure/function analysis of ryanodine receptors has identified several important regions in the molecule. Malignant hyperthermia and central core disease mutations, found in the sequences lying between amino acids 35 and 614 and 2163 and 2458 (10.Loke J. MacLennan D.H. Am. J. Med. 1998; 104: 470-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), alter sensitivity of the channel to caffeine and halothane (11.Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Another central core disease mutation has been found in the C terminus in predicted transmembrane 9 (TM9) or its adjacent lumenal domain (13.Lynch P.J. Tong J. Lehane M. Mallet A. Giblin L. Heffron J.J. Vaughan P. Zafra G. MacLennan D.H. McCarthy T.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Evidence that the Ca2+ sensor lies in TM2 has been presented by Chenet al. (14.Chen S.R.W. Ebisawa K. Li X. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14675-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), who showed that mutation of Glu3987in RyR3 (equivalent to Glu4032 in RyR1) caused a huge decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity. Other mutations of acidic amino acids in TM2, TM7, and TM10 have also been shown to block caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol activation and high affinity ryanodine binding, but single channel function was not analyzed (15.Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31867-31872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Evidence that TM9 is a Ca2+ channel pore has been presented by Chen and co-workers (16.Zhao M. Li P. Li X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), showing that a single mutation, G4824A, reduced single channel conductance from 798 pS for the wild type channel to 22 pS. The mutant channel was modulated by Ca2+, Mg2+, ATP, caffeine, ruthenium red, and ryanodine. Co-expression of wild type and G4824A mutant proteins yielded single channels with intermediate unitary conductances. This is in line with observations in the central core disease mutation (13.Lynch P.J. Tong J. Lehane M. Mallet A. Giblin L. Heffron J.J. Vaughan P. Zafra G. MacLennan D.H. McCarthy T.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Deletion of the N-terminal sequences of RyR1 revealed that one-fifth of the C-terminal sequence contains structures sufficient to form a functional Ca2+ release channel, but the N-terminal sequence also regulates the release channel (17.Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Takeshima H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1329-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Deletion of 3 amino acids at the C terminus of RyR1 resulted in decreased activities, whereas deletion of 15 amino acids yielded an inactive RyR (18.Gao L. Tripathy A. Lu X. Meissner G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In earlier studies, we used chimeric molecules to exploit the differences between Ca2+ inactivation profiles of RyR1 and RyR2, allowing us to localize the low affinity Ca2+ binding site(s) that inactivates the channel between amino acids 3726 and 5037 (19.Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26120-26126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These conclusions have been supported in recent studies by Nakaiet al. (20.Nakai J. Gao L. Xu L. Xin C. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We also found that RyR chimeras containing the C-terminal sequence of RyR2 were more sensitive to Ca2+activation than RyR1. This was unexpected, because Ca2+activation in native or recombinant RyR1 and RyR2 is similar (3.Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 53-98PubMed Google Scholar,21.Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). RyR2 and RyR1/RyR2 chimeras containing the RyR2 C terminus were also more sensitive to caffeine activation than RyR1 (3.Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 53-98PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26120-26126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that the caffeine activation site might also be located in this region. Caffeine appears to activate RyR by increasing Ca2+ sensitivity (3.Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 53-98PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, sequence changes in this region affect the sensitivity of the channel to activation by Ca2+ and caffeine and to inactivation by elevated Ca2+. Within the C-terminal sequence studied earlier (19.Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26120-26126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), amino acids 4187–4628 are most closely associated with activation and inactivation of RyR1. This sequence overlaps nearly all of divergent region 1 (D1) (amino acids 4254–4631), one of the three most divergent regions between RyR1 and RyR2. The other divergent regions in RyR1 are D2 (amino acids 1342–1403) and D3 (amino acids 1872–1923) (22.Sorrentino V. Volpe P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). D2 and D3 sequences have been related to excitation-contraction coupling (19.Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26120-26126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,23.Yamazawa T. Takeshima H. Shimuta M. Iino M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13403-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). D3 is unlikely to be involved in Ca2+ inactivation (19.Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26120-26126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20.Nakai J. Gao L. Xu L. Xin C. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The role of D1 is unknown. In an attempt to clarify the role of D1 in Ca2+ release channel function, we have subdivided D1 into three small chimeras and constructed a deletion mutant in this region. We tested the Ca2+ dependence of high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding to these mutant proteins to look at both Ca2+ activation and Ca2+ inactivation and we measured in vivo Ca2+ release induced by caffeine with Ca2+ photometry. Our results show that the high affinity ryanodine binding site and caffeine and Ca2+activation sites are not located in the sequence between 4274–4535 but suggest that part of the Ca2+ inactivation site resides in the sequence that includes amino acids 4187–4381. Pfu DNA polymerase, restriction endonucleases, and other DNA modifying enzymes were from Stratagene, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, New England Biolabs, Promega, and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (AM) was from Molecular Probes; caffeine and protease inhibitors were from Sigma; [3H]ryanodine was from NEN Life Science Products; unlabeled ryanodine was from Calbiochem; CHAPS was from Bio-Rad; and phosphatidylcholine was from Avanti Polar Lipids. The expression vector pcDNA 3.1(–) was from Invitrogen. Monoclonal antibody 34C (mAb 34C) was a kind gift from Dr. Judith Airey (25.Airey J.A. Beck C.F. Murakami K. Tanksley S.J. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Sutko J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14187-14194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other reagents were of reagent grade or the highest grade available. The methods for expression of cDNAs encoding rabbit skeletal muscle RyR1 and cardiac muscle RyR2 were described previously (21.Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26.Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H.

The boundaries used in construction of chimeric RYR cDNAs from RYR1 andRYR2 and of deletion-mutated RYR cDNAs are outlined in Fig. 1. The three regions most divergent in amino acid sequence between RyR1 and RyR2 are labeled as D1–D3 (22.Sorrentino V. Volpe P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) in Fig. 1. Part of cassette 10 (C10), lying between NheI andXcaI in a modified RYR1 cDNA (11.Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. McCarthy T.V. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26332-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and encoding amino acids 4187–4628 encompassing the D1 region, is designated F10. The construction of chimeric RyR involving F10 has been described previously (19.Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26120-26126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). F10a contains RyR1 amino acids 4187–4381, F10b contains RyR1 amino acids 4382–4556, and F10c contains RyR1 amino acids 4557–4628. RYR2 fragments were amplified using aPfu polymerase-based polymerase chain reaction in which restriction endonuclease sites were introduced at each end (NheI-SphI for F10a,SphI-NruI for F10b, andNruI-XcaI for F10c). The NruI site in F10 was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis with polymerase chain reaction. These fragments were inserted into their corresponding locations in pBS-F10 to form pBS-F10a, pBS-F10b, and pBS-F10c. The F10 fragments in the last three constructs were further cleaved and inserted into pBS-RyR1 to form pBS-RF10a, pBS-RF10b, and pBS-RF10c. The full-length chimeric constructs were subcloned into pcDNA 3.1(−) with XbaI and HindIII to obtain pcDNA-RF10a, pcDNA-RF10b, and pcDNA-RF10c. The construction of a deletion mutant involving the D1 region was carried out in RYR1 cDNA cassette 10 (NheI-ClaI) (Fig. 1). In C10, there are fiveNarI sites (12819, 12840, 12873, 13107, and 13605). To obtain Δ4274–4535-C10, C10 was digested with NarI to delete DNA sequence 12819–13605 and self-ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The deleted C10 was inserted into the corresponding region of pBS-RyR1, and the resulting cDNA sequence was then excised and inserted into pcDNA3.1(−) with XbaI and HindIII to form Δ4274–4535-R1. These chimeric inserts and the deletion mutant were confirmed by DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme-digestion mapping. Culture of HEK-293 cells and cDNA transfection by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (28.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4823) Google Scholar), were carried out as described previously (27.Chen S.R. Leong P. Imredy J.P. Bartlett C. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1904-1912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A microfluorometry system (Photon Technologies Inc.) was used to monitor the Fura-2 AM fluorescence changes in transiently transfected or nontransfected HEK-293 cells, as described previously (21.Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transfected HEK-293 cells grown in 100-mm Petri dishes were solubilized with 1% CHAPS and 5 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine and analyzed with the [3H]ryanodine binding assay described previously (21.Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, 25-μl aliquots of solubilized total cellular protein were diluted 10-fold in binding buffer composed of 0.5 m KCl, 1 mm ATP, 100 μm free Ca2+, 0.2 mm EGTA, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, a protease inhibitor mix (0.1 mm AEBSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml of each of leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and E64), and various concentrations of [3H]ryanodine. Nonspecific binding was determined using a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled ryanodine. After 2 h at 37 °C, the 0.25-ml samples were diluted with 1 ml of ice-cold washing buffer composed of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, and 0.25 m KCl and placed on Whatman GF/B membrane filters presoaked with 1% polyethyleneimine in washing buffer. Filters were washed three times with 6 ml of washing buffer. [3H]Ryanodine bound to the filter was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. All binding assays were carried out in duplicate. To assess the effects of Ca2+ on high affinity ryanodine binding, protocols were modified by removal of ATP from the binding buffer and addition of different concentrations of Ca2+ with 2.5 nm [3H]ryanodine. Free Ca2+ was calculated using the apparent binding constants described by Fabiato (29.Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). About 50 μg of proteins from cells lysed with CHAPS were separated by 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (30.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar). RyR proteins were detected by immunoblotting (31.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44935) Google Scholar) as described previously (26.Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by dye binding using bovine serum albumin as a standard (32.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data were analyzed with Microcal Origin software (Microcal Software Ltd., Northampton, MA). Scatchard analysis was used to determine the dissociation constant (K d) and maximal binding capacity (B max) from equilibrium binding data. EC50 or IC50 values were obtained by fitting the curves with an equation for logistic dose response. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. An unpaired Studentt test was used for evaluation of the mean values between groups. A value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. In earlier studies, we showed differences in the curves of Ca2+ dependence for [3H]ryanodine binding to recombinant RyR1 and RyR2 that could be equated with differences in Ca2+ inactivation (21.Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We exploited this difference to locate the Ca2+ inactivation sites of RyR1 in the COOH terminus, in particular, in fragments between amino acids 3726–4186 (F9) and 4187–4628 (F10) (19.Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26120-26126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We also observed that chimeras containing F9 and F10 were more sensitive to Ca2+ and caffeine activation, implying that these two sequences might be involved in Ca2+ and caffeine activation of RyR. Because F10 encompasses the most divergent region (D1) between RyR1 and RyR2, and because we were interested in the role of this region in Ca2+ release channel function, we subdivided the D1 region of RyR1 into three smaller chimeras by substitution with the corresponding regions of RyR2 (Fig. 1). We also constructed a deletion mutant in the D1 region of RyR1 (Fig.1). These constructs were then transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells, and the Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding (21.Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was used as an indirect measurement of Ca2+activation and inactivation. In addition, caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was measured in vivo by Ca2+ photometry using HEK-293 cells transfected with chimeric or deletion-mutant RYR cDNA. Immunostaining of CHAPS-solubilized cell lysates, using monoclonal antibody 34C against an epitope located in RyR1 amino acids 2756–2803 (11.Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. McCarthy T.V. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26332-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), was used to detect the expression of RyR proteins in transfected HEK-293 cells. Fig. 2 shows the absence of RyR immunostaining in pcDNA-transfected cells. Because the chimeric and deletion-mutated proteins all retained the RyR1 epitope, immunostaining with monoclonal antibody 34C was used as a measure of RyR expression. Immunostaining demonstrated that the chimeras RF10a, RF10b, RF10c, and the deletion mutant Δ4274–4535-R1 were expressed at levels comparable to wild type RyR1 and that RF10a and Δ4274–4535-R1 were expressed at levels higher than that of RyR1. It has been demonstrated that RyR1 and RyR2 are not expressed with equal efficiency, and F10 and F11 from RyR2 have been shown to be the key sequences conferring high levels of expression in HEK-293 cells (19.Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26120-26126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, a smaller fragment, F10a from RyR2, was also shown to confer high level expression. We have observed that RyR2 and chimeras containing the F10 sequence have a higher mobility than RyR1 in SDS gels. When F10 was subdivided, there was no obvious difference in mobility when compared with RyR1. The mutant Δ4274–4535-R1 had a slightly higher mobility due to deletion of 262 amino acids. We used Fura-2 fluorescence to measure the properties of caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in the chimeric or deletion-mutant proteins expressed in HEK-293 cells (21.Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). No significant Ca2+ release occurred with caffeine up to 30 mm in pcDNA-transfected cells (21.Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was observed in cells transfected with each of the constructs. The peak fluorescence amplitude was measured during the course of incremental application of 0.03 to 30 mm caffeine and normalized to the peak amplitude for maximal Ca2+ release induced by 30 mmcaffeine. EC50 values were then calculated by fitting the caffeine dose-response curves with an equation for logistic dose response. As described previously (21.Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), EC50 values measuring the caffeine sensitivity of Ca2+ release were higher for recombinant RyR2 than for recombinant RyR1 (Fig.3). Dose response curves for RyR1, RyR2, RF10, and chimeric and deletion-mutant proteins are shown in Fig. 3. EC50 values are summarized in the inset to Fig.3. Chimera RF10b had an EC50 value for caffeine that was similar to RyR1. However, chimeras RF10, RF10a and mutant Δ4274–4535-R1 had lower caffeine EC50 values, and RF10c had a higher caffeine EC50 value. Because caffeine activation was retained after deletion of sequences in the D1 region, caffeine activation sites are unlikely to be located in this region. The higher caffeine sensitivity exhibited by the RF10 and RF10a chimeras and the deletion mutant Δ4274–4535-R1 and the lower sensitivity by the RF10c chimera might be explained by induced conformations that modulate the Ca2+ release channel function, either negatively or positively. The Hill coefficients for chimeras RF10, RF10a, and RF10b resembled that for RyR2 (Fig. 3,inset), and the Hill coefficients for other constructs were similar to that of RyR1, indicating that the F10a (and possibly F10b) sequence of RyR2 can partially suppress the co-operative interactions that occur in RyR1. We measured the equilibrium binding properties of [3H]ryanodine to the chimeric and mutated RyR proteins to determine whether the high affinity ryanodine binding site was preserved. We also used [3H]ryanodine binding to determine expression levels, because 1 mol of a tetrameric RyR molecule binds 1 mol of ryanodine with high affinity (21.Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26.Chen S.R. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H.

Scatchard analysis showed a single binding site in all of the chimeras and the deletion mutant (Fig. 4), effectively ruling out the possibility that the high affinity ryanodine binding site is located between amino acids 4274 and 4535.K d values for these mutants were similar to those for wild type RyR2 and RyR1 (Ref. 21.Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar and Fig. 4, inset), ranging from 1.6 nm for RF10 to 3.3 nm for RF10a. These data indicate that the high affinity binding site for ryanodine is unchanged in all of these mutants. TheB max values ranged from 0.22 to 1.42 pmol/mg of protein in these chimeras and mutants (Fig. 4, inset), reflecting different expression levels. These results show that RF10a expression, like RF10 expression, was increased 5–6-fold over RyR1 expression. The expression of Δ4274–4535-R1 was increased 3-fold, confirming results from immunoblotting. As reported previously (21.Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), there was no significant binding in lysates isolated from pcDNA-transfected HEK-293 cells. Dose-response curves for Ca2+ activation and inactivation of [3H]ryanodine binding to wild type RyR1 and RyR2 and RF10 were shown previously (19.Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26120-26126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21.Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The dose-response curves for Ca2+ activation and inactivation of [3H]ryanodine binding to the mutants are shown in Fig.5, where they are compared with those of RF10. At Ca2+ concentrations below pCa 7, there was little binding of [3H]ryanodine to the RyR proteins, except for Δ4274–4535-R1, which bound nearly 0.14 pmol of [3H]ryanodine per mg of protein in the absence of Ca2+. This level of activation was observed even in the presence of 1 mm EGTA (data not shown). As with wild type RyR1 and RyR2, [3H]ryanodine binding was activated by increasing Ca2+ concentrations, with maximal binding occurring between pCa 5.7 and pCa 4 for most of the constructs. EC50 values, expressed in pCa units, were similar for wild type RyR1 and RyR2, and the EC50 value for RF10a did not differ from that of either RyR1 or RyR2 (Fig. 5 and TableI). However, in chimeras RF10b and RF10c and especially in the mutant Δ4274–4535-R1, activation of [3H]ryanodine binding was observed with lower Ca2+ concentrations, and EC50 values were significantly higher than those for wild type RyR1 and RyR2 (Fig. 5 and Table I). In addition, the slope for RF10b and Δ4274–4535-R1 was decreased below 0.7, indicating that the co-operativity of Ca2+ activation that is observed in wild type RyR1 and RyR2 is absent in these mutants and is lowered below 2 in mutants RF10 and RF10c.Table ICa 2+ activation (EC50) and Ca 2+ inactivation (IC50) for Ca 2+ dependence of [ 3 H]ryanodine binding to RyR1, RyR2, and their chimeras and mutantEC50SlopeIC50SlopepCapCaRyR16.21 ± 0.082.2 ± 0.62.43 ± 0.131.1 ± 0.2RyR26.14 ± 0.122.6 ± 0.30.12 ± 0.08ap ≤ 0.05 compared with RyR1.0.2 ± 0.1RF106.70 ± 0.05ap ≤ 0.05 compared with RyR1.1.6 ± 0.11.56 ± 0.09ap ≤ 0.05 compared with RyR1.1.1 ± 0.3RF10a6.49 ± 0.172.0 ± 0.11.90 ± 0.03ap ≤ 0.05 compared with RyR1.1.1 ± 0.3RF10b6.86 ± 0.09ap ≤ 0.05 compared with RyR1.0.7 ± 0.12.09 ± 0.110.9 ± 0.1RF10c6.51 ± 0.03ap ≤ 0.05 compared with RyR1.1.3 ± 0.22.20 ± 0.081.0 ± 0.1Δ4274–4535-R17.45 ± 0.08ap ≤ 0.05 compared with RyR1.0.5 ± 0.022.01 ± 0.09ap ≤ 0.05 compared with RyR1.1.5 ± 0.2Values were obtained by fitting the curves, from three or four separate experiments for each construct, as shown in Fig. 5, with the logistic dose response equation for EC50 and IC50.

Ca2+ inactivation was studied indirectly through measurement of the inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding by elevated Ca2+. IC50 values for the chimeric and deletion mutant RyR proteins, expressed in pCa units, are also presented in Table I and illustrated in Fig. 5, where they are compared with values for wild type RyR1, RyR2, and RF10. The IC50for chimeras RF10b and F10c did not differ from that of wild type RyR1. IC50 values were significantly reduced, however, for chimera RF10a (pCa 1.90), associating the RF10a sequence (amino acids 4187–4381) with the low affinity Ca2+ binding site. The slopes for the curves of inactivation were not changed for chimeras and mutant Δ4274–4535-R1, when compared with RyR1. Mutant Δ4274–4535-R1 also had a lower IC50 (pCa 2.01) when compared with RyR1, suggesting some involvement of this sequence with the low affinity Ca2+ binding site, perhaps in its region of overlap with RF10a. In an earlier study, we measured alterations in Ca2+release channel function that resulted from exchange of RyR1 sequences with corresponding sequences in RyR2 (19.Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26120-26126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, we substituted shorter sequences in RyR1 with corresponding sequences in RyR2 and measured alterations in channel sensitivity to Ca2+ and caffeine. This strategy allowed us to map part of the Ca2+ inactivation site to the F10a sequence (amino acids 4187–4381). Decreased sensitivity to inactivation by Ca2+ in mutant Δ4274–4535-R1 may be due either to the deletion of the Ca2+ inactivation site in the region of overlap with RF10a or to conformational changes induced by the deletion. Increased sensitivity to activation by Ca2+ or caffeine was also observed in all chimeras. This is unlikely to involve the activation sites for Ca2+ and caffeine, because the deletion mutant Δ4274–4535-R1 exhibited increased sensitivity to Ca2+ and caffeine. In fact, high affinity Ca2+binding sites are suggested to be in hydrophobic sequences (14.Chen S.R.W. Ebisawa K. Li X. Zhang L. J. Biol.

They showed that the mutant channel retained normal conductance, but sensitivity to activating Ca2+ was reduced by 10,000-fold, and heterotetrameric forms of wild type and mutant channels, created by coexpression, had intermediate Ca2+ sensitivities. Therefore, it is most likely that the increased sensitivity observed in the chimeras was due to conformational changes that might have altered function through long range effects. The use of antibodies against several domains in the D1 region has been associated with Ca2+ activation of the Ca2+release channel. Polyclonal antibodies against the junctional face membrane of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum and purified ryanodine receptor from skeletal muscle blocked Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and decreased single channel open probability and conductance (35.Zorzato F. Chu A. Volpe P. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 36.Fill M. Mejia-Alvarez R. Zorzato F. Volpe P. Stefani E. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Some of the epitopes recognized by these anti-RyR antibodies have been mapped to amino acids 4445–4586 and 4760–4877. Polyclonal antibodies raised against amino acids 4380–4621 and 4425–4621 in the C terminus of RyR1 decreased Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and doxorubicin-induced Ca2+ release from isolated terminal cisternae (37.Treves S. Chiozzi P. Zorzato F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). An antibody raised against amino acids 4478–4512 increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of the Ca2+release channel (38.Chen S.R. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23318-23326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the antibody was purified with a Pro-Glu repeat peptide sequence (amino acids 4490–4499), the purified antibody inhibited Ca2+- or caffeine-activated channel activity but did not inhibit ATP-activated channel activity (39.Chen S.R. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13414-13421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major epitopes for the antibody made against amino acids 4478–4512 were shown not to be located in the Pro-Glu repeat region. From these results, it might be deduced that the domains involving Ca2+ activation are associated with or lie close to the cytoplasmic loop between proposed transmembrane sequences 2 and 5 in the Zorzato numbering scheme. These earlier results are, therefore, consistent with our current results. However, the Ca2+ activation site itself is not likely to be located between amino acids 4274 and 4535, as discussed above. Because deletion of amino acids 4274–4535 increased channel sensitivity to activation by Ca2+ and caffeine, this sequence in RyR1 could form a complex domain, which modulates RyR1 channel function, presumably by suppressing channel activation. The sequences in RyR1 that were exchanged or deleted in this study, with the exception of RF10c, would be likely to form a cytoplasmic loop between M2 and M5 in the topological model of Zorzato et al.(7.Zorzato F.

Although M3 (amino acids 4277–4299), M4 (amino acids 4342–4362), and M5 (amino acids 4559–4580) were predicted to be transmembrane sequences (7.Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), M3 and M4 are not highly conserved among RyR isoforms and are no longer considered to be transmembrane sequences (15.Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31867-31872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). M5 is one of the most hydrophobic sequences in RyR1 and is almost certain to be a transmembrane sequence (6.Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M.

The fact that channel function was not destroyed after deletion of amino acids 4274–4535, which includes the sequences formerly designated M3 and M4, provides further reason to think that these sequences do not form any part of the channel pore. Nothing is known of the structure of this probable cytoplasmic loop region, although Gly-, Ala-, and Pro-rich sequences between amino acids 4274 and 4535 (6.Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T.

Most of this sequence is hydrophilic, implying that at least part of the sequence is surface-exposed and antigenic (39.Chen S.R. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Binding sites for calmodulin have been identified between structural domains 3 and 7 in RyR1 (42.Wagenknecht T. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Wiederrecht G.J. Xin H.B. Fleischer S. Biophys.

Deletion of more than 200 amino acids might be apparent in cryoelectron microscopy of this mutant form of RyR1, providing a means to localize it in RyR1. Knowledge of the location of regulatory domains relative to the channel forming domains could be helpful in understanding the regulation of the Ca2+release channel."

Ca2+ channel inactivation was modulated by coexpressing the α1A-DHP- or α1Lc-subunits in Xenopus oocytes with either the β2a- or the β1a-subunit and amino acid substitutions in L-type segment IVS6 (I1497A, I1498A, and V1504A). Contrary to a modulated receptor mechanism assuming high affinity DHP binding to the inactivated state we observed no clear correlation between steady state inactivation and Ca2+ channel block by (+)-isradipine: (i) a 3-fold larger fraction of α1A-DHP/β1achannels in steady state inactivation at −80 mV (compared with α1A-DHP/β2a) did not enhance the block by (+)-isradipine; (ii) different steady state inactivation of α1Lc mutants at −30 mV did not correlate with voltage-dependent channel block; and (iii) the midpoint-voltages of the inactivation curves of slowly inactivating L-type constructs and more rapidly inactivating α1Lc/β1a channels were shifted to a comparable extent to more hyperpolarized voltages. A kinetic analysis of (+)-isradipine interaction with different L-type channel constructs revealed a drug-induced inactivated state. Entry and recovery from drug-induced inactivation are modulated by intrinsic inactivation determinants, suggesting a synergism between intrinsic inactivation and DHP block. The role of the inactivated channel conformation in the molecular mechanism of Ca2+ channel block by the 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) (+)-isradipine was analyzed in L-type channel constructs (α1Lc; Berjukow, S., Gapp, F., Aczel, S., Sinnegger, M.

A kinetic analysis of (+)-isradipine interaction with different L-type channel constructs revealed a drug-induced inactivated state. Entry and recovery from drug-induced inactivation are modulated by intrinsic inactivation determinants, suggesting a synergism between intrinsic inactivation and DHP block. dihydropyridine Ca2+ channels are hetero-oligomeric protein complexes consisting of a pore-forming α1-subunit, one out of at least four β-subunits (β1-β4), an α2/δ-subunit, and in skeletal muscle an additional γ-subunit (3.Catterall W.A.

Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The auxiliary channel subunits, in particular the β-subunits, modulate voltage dependence, expression density, and kinetics of Ca2+ channels (for review see Ref. 4.Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). There is biochemical evidence that multiple β-subunits are associated with the α1-subunit, suggesting a tissue-specific modulation of Ca2+ channel properties by different β-subunit expression patterns (5.Liu H.

The α1-subunits of L-type Ca2+ channels (classes C (formed by α1C-subunits), D (formed by α1D-subunits), and S (formed by α1S-subunits)) possess drug receptors for 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs),1phenylalkylamines, and benzothiazepines (7.Hockerman G.H.

Physiol. 1977; 69: 497-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar), the interaction of an ion channel blocker with its receptor sites depends on whether the channel is in a resting (closed), open (activated), or inactivated (closed) conformational state. This hypothesis was applied to Ca2+ channel block by organic calcium channel blockers such as phenylalkylamines, benzothiazepines, and DHPs (15.Bean B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6388-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 16.Sanguinetti M.C. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 1984; 55: 336-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In the frame of a specific version of the modulated receptor model, the more efficient Ca2+ channel inhibition by DHPs at depolarized membrane potentials is interpreted as predominant block of inactivated channels. Accordingly, stronger DHP antagonist action in the depolarized vascular tissue was suggested to reflect a more efficient block of inactivated Ca2+ channels (but see Refs. 17.Welling A. Ludwig A. Zimmer S. Klugbauer N. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar and18.Hu H. Marban E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 902-907PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of the inactivated channel conformation in the molecular mechanism of Ca2+ channel block by DHPs, we have designed Ca2+ channels inactivating at different rates by co-expressing a L-type channel construct α1Lc (1.Berjukow S. Gapp F. Aczel S. Sinnegger M.J. Mitterdorfer J. Glossmann H. Hering S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6154-6160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or the DHP-sensitive class A Ca2+ channel mutant α1A-DHP (2.Sinnegger M.J. Wang Z. Grabner M. Hering S.

Additionally, Ca2+ channel inactivation was modulated by introducing point mutations into segment IVS6 of α1Lc. The consequences of changed inactivation properties for (+)-isradipine-induced block were analyzed by means of the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique after expression inXenopus oocytes. We observed no clear correlation between the amount of steady state inactivation and voltage-dependent block by (+)-isradipine. Our data support a hypothesis where the inactivation gating of Ca2+ channels is accelerated in their antagonist DHP-bound form. Channel constructs with impaired fast inactivation displayed faster recovery from block by (+)-isradipine, suggesting a close interdependence between intrinsic inactivation determinants and the (+)-isradipine-induced inactivated state. Mutations I1497A, I1498A, and V1504A were introduced into cDNA of the L-type channel construct α1Lc (1.Berjukow S. Gapp F. Aczel S. Sinnegger M.J. Mitterdorfer J. Glossmann H. Hering S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6154-6160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) by using an EcoRV-BstEII cassette (nucleotides 4542 and 4833). α1Lc is a construct corresponding to rabbit α1C-a cDNA (19.Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar) with part of the amino terminus replaced by carp α1S-sequence as described (1.Berjukow S. Gapp F. Aczel S. Sinnegger M.J.

Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Amino acid and nucleotide numbering of αLc and mutants derived thereof is according to α1C-a cDNA sequence (19.Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). All mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction as described previously (10.Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Fragments amplified by polymerase chain reaction were sequenced entirely to confirm sequence integrity. Inward barium currents (I Ba) were studied with two microelectrode voltage-clamp of Xenopus oocytes 2–7 days after microinjection of approximately equimolar cRNA mixtures of α1Lc or α1A-DHP (2.Sinnegger M.J.

Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The corresponding constructs were named α1Lc/A-DHP/β1a or α1Lc/A-DHP/β2a channels. Mutant α1Lc-subunits (named herein I1497A, I1498A, and V1504A; see above) were coexpressed with α2δ and the β1a-subunit exclusively. All experiments were carried out at room temperature in a bath solution with the following composition: 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 50 mm NaOH, 5 mm HEPES, 2 mm CsOH (pH adjusted to 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid). Voltage recording and current injecting microelectrodes were filled with 2.8 mCsCl, 0.2 m CsOH, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.4) and had resistances of 0.3–2 MΩ. Resting channel block was estimated as peak I Ba inhibition during 100-ms test pulses from −80 to 20 mV at a frequency of 0.033 Hz until steady state was reached. The dose response curves ofI Ba inhibition were fitted using the Hill equation:I Ba, drug/I Ba, control(as percentages) = (100 − A)/(1 + (C/IC50) n H) +A, where IC50 is the concentration at whichI Ba inhibition is half-maximal, C is the applied drug concentration, A is the fraction ofI Ba that is not blocked, andn H is the Hill coefficient. Recovery from inactivation was studied at a holding potential of −80 mV after depolarizing Ca2+ channels during a 3-s prepulse to 20 mV by applying 30-ms test pulses (to 20 mV) at various time intervals after the conditioning prepulse. PeakI Ba values were normalized to the peak current measured during the prepulse, and the time course ofI Ba recovery from inactivation was fitted to a mono- or biexponential function (I Ba, recovery= A × exp(−t/τfast) +B × exp(−t/τslow) +C). Voltage dependence of inactivation under quasi-steady state conditions was measured using a multi step protocol to account for run-down (less than 10%). A control test pulse (50 ms to 20 mV) was followed by a 1.5-s step to −100 mV followed by a 30-s conditioning step, a 4-ms step to −100 mV, and a subsequent test pulse to 20 mV (corresponding to the peak potential of the I-V curves). Inactivation during the 30 s conditioning pulse was calculated as follows. IBa,inactivation=1−IBa,test(20 mV)/IBa,control(20 mV)Equation 1 The pulse sequence was applied every 3 min from a holding potential of −100 mV. Inactivation curves were drawn according to the following Boltzmann equation. IBa,inactivation=ISS+(1−ISS)(1+exp[(V−V0.5)/k)]Equation 2 where V is the membrane potential,V 0.5 is the midpoint voltage, k is the slope factor, and I ss is the fraction of noninactivating current. Steady state inactivation of α1A-DHP and α1Lc channels at −80 mV was estimated by shifting the membrane holding potential from −80 to −100 mV (α1Lc) or −120 mV (α1A-DHP). Subsequent monitoring of the corresponding changes in I Ba amplitudes until steady state revealed the fraction of Ca2+ channels in the inactivated state at −80 mV. Steady state inactivation of different L-type channel constructs at −30 mV was estimated by fitting time course of current inactivation to a biexponential function (see Fig.4 A). The I Ba inactivation time constants were estimated by fitting the I Ba decay to a mono or biexponential function. Data are given as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was calculated according to Student's unpaired t test. To evaluate the role of β-subunit mediated inactivation in Ca2+ channel block by isradipine, we coexpressed the α1Lc (1.Berjukow S. Gapp F. Aczel S. Sinnegger M.J. Mitterdorfer J. Glossmann H.

In line with previous observations (20.Cens T. Restituito S. Galas S. Charnet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5483-5490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), α1Lc/β2achannels displayed slower inactivation kinetics than α1Lc/β1a channels (Fig.1). At −80 mV α1Lc/β1a channels displayed slightly more steady state inactivation than α1Lc/β2achannels (p > 0.05; Fig. 1 D). Slowly inactivating α1Lc/β2a channels were blocked by (+)-isradipine with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 198 ± 35 nm (n = 3), which was not statistically different from block of more rapidly inactivating α1Lc/β1a channels (IC50 = 327 ± 41 nm, p > 0.05; Fig.1 A). The DHP-sensitive class A Ca2+ channel mutant α1A-DHP inactivates at a faster rate than L-type channels and displays an inactivation curve that is, compared with L-type channels, significantly shifted into the hyperpolarizing direction (2.Sinnegger M.J.

The slightly higher DHP sensitivity of this channel construct compared with L-type channels could therefore reflect a more efficient drug interaction with the inactivated channel state at −80 mV. To test this hypothesis we coexpressed the α1A-DHP-subunit with different β-subunits and analyzed the (+)-isradipine sensitivity of the two channel constructs inactivating at different rates. As shown for α1Lc/β2a (Fig. 1 B), coexpression of the β2a-subunit dramatically slowed the inactivation time course of the resulting α1A-DHP/β2achannels (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, at −80 mV we observed a 3-fold larger steady state fraction of α1A-DHP/β1a channels in inactivation (46 ± 2%, n = 4) than in α1A-DHP/β2a (16 ± 2%,n = 5, p < 0.01; Fig. 2 D). A modulated receptor mechanism implying high affinity block of inactivated channels would predict a more pronounced inhibition of α1A-DHP/β1a channels. The concentration of (+)-isradipine for half-maximal block of I Ba in α1A-DHP/β1a channels (IC50 = 61 ± 14, n = 4) at −80 mV was, however, not significantly different from α1A-DHP/β2a(IC50 = 52 ± 14, p > 0.05; Fig.2 A). These data clearly indicate that enhanced inactivation did not cause stronger I Ba inhibition of α1A-DHP/β1a channels. To evaluate the role of channel inactivation determinants in the pore forming α1Lc-subunit for channel block by (+)-isradipine, we replaced three amino acids in segment IVS6 of α1Lc by alanine (I1497A, I1498A, and V1504A) and analyzed the DHP sensitivity of the resulting mutants. As shown in Fig. 3 A, alanine substitutions of the two putative DHP-binding determinants (I1497A and I1498A; Ref. 7.Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 361-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mutation V1504A (1.Berjukow S. Gapp F. Aczel S. Sinnegger M.J. Mitterdorfer J. Glossmann H. Hering S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6154-6160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) significantly slowed channel inactivation kinetics. None of the point mutations reduced Ca2+ channel inhibition by (+)-isradipine (Fig.3 B). Instead, we observed a significant decrease in the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations for peakI Ba inhibition of I1497A (IC50 = 28 ± 10 nm), I1498A (IC50 = 50 ± 11 nm), and V1504A (IC50 = 71 ± 15 nm) compared with α1Lc/β1a(IC50 = 327 ± 41 nm, p < 0.05, n ≥ 4; Fig. 1). At a holding potential of −80 mV, the fraction of inactivated channels was not significantly different between the various L-type channel constructs (ranging from 5 ± 2% (V1504A, n = 5) to 3 ± 1% (α1Lc/β1a,n = 5)). The observed changes in drug sensitivity at −80 mV appear, therefore, to be associated with a more pronounced resting channel block. To evaluate the role of the inactivated channel conformation of our L-type constructs as high affinity receptor for (+)-isradipine, we estimated the steady state inactivation at −30 mV (see pulse protocol in inset of Fig.4 A). Different channel constructs displayed significantly different steady state inactivation at −30 mV (ranging in the absence of drug between 9 ± 1% (α1Lc/β1a, n = 5) and 21 ± 3% (I1498A, n = 4)) (Fig. 4, Cand D). We did, however, not observe a simple relation between inactivation and voltage-dependent channel block by (+)-isradipine. As illustrated in Fig. 4 (A and B), a higher fraction of steady state inactivation in α1Lc/β2a channels did not result in a stronger voltage-dependent channel block compared with α1Lc/β1a channels. Compared with its effect on α1Lc/β1a channels (56 ± 3% additional current inhibition, n = 4), the drug induced significantly less channel block in α1Lc/β2a (40 ± 4%), I1498A (25 ± 2%), and V1504A channels (34 ± 5%, n > 7; Fig. 4 C). Plotting the fraction of steady state inactivation of the different L-type channel mutants at −30 mV against the amount of drug-induced inactivation revealed even a reversed correlation (r = 0.94) between these two parameters (Fig.4 D). The different inactivation properties of constructs α1Lc/β1a, α1Lc/β2a, I1498A, and V1504A prompted us to analyze the voltage dependence of channel inactivation in control and the presence of (+)-isradipine in more detail. The inactivation curves (measured with 30 s conditioning prepulses) in control and the presence of 10 nm, 100 nm, and 1 μm (+)-isradipine are illustrated in Fig.5. The midpoint voltages of the inactivation curves of all four L-type constructs were shifted to a comparable extent in the hyperpolarizing direction (Fig. 5 and TableI). A modulated receptor mechanism would predict a correlation between channel inactivation during the conditioning prepulses and voltage-dependent channel block. No such correlation was observed.Table ISlope factors (k) and midpoint voltages (V0.5) of the inactivation curves shown in Fig. 5Control10 nM100 nM1 μMV0.5kV0.5kV0.5kV0.5kα1Lc/β1a−11 ± 212.4 ± 1.1−16 ± 211.9 ± 1.0−24 ± 112.8 ± 0.8−35 ± 318.7 ± 1.5α1Lc/β2a−17 ± 313.1 ± 1.2−31 ± 413.7 ± 1.2−34 ± 316.4 ± 0.7−38 ± 416.7 ± 1.8I1498A−20 ± 215.4 ± 1.4−25 ± 318.8 ± 1.2−32 ± 222.6 ± 1.0−39 ± 322.0 ± 1.3V1504A−21 ± 310.6 ± 1.6−26 ± 310.9 ± 1.1−39 ± 314.5 ± 1.1−40 ± 415.2 ± 1.4Corresponding shifts of V 0.5 in the presence of 1 μm: 24 ± 3 (α1Lc/β1a), 21 ± 4 (α1Lc/β2a), 21 ± 3 (I1498A), and 19 ± 3 (V1504A) were not significantly different (p > 0.1).

Ca2+ channel inactivation at −30 mV developed with a biexponential time course (Fig. 4). The fast inactivation time constant (τfast) ranged between 0.42 ± 0.06 s (I1497A) and 0.92 ± 0.07 s (α1Lc/β2a), and the slow inactivation time constant (τslow) ranged between 10.1 ± 2.1 s (I1497A) and 14.0 ± 2.1 s (α1Lc/β1a). (+)-Isradipine (1 μm) induced an additional fast component in Ca2+ channel inactivation developing with similar kinetics as fast inactivation in control. The fast inactivation time constant (τfast, isradipine) ranged in the different constructs between 0.51 ± 0.06 s (I1498A) and 0.89 ± 0.08 s (I1497A). The slow component in channel inactivation at −30 mV was not significantly affected by the drug (Fig. 4, A andB). These findings suggest that (+)-isradipine promotes a channel conformation resembling intrinsic fast inactivation. The fraction of channels in this new drug-induced inactivated state correlated with the drug-induced steady state inactivation (Fig.4 C). (+)-Isradipine-induced changes in I Bakinetics at 20 mV are illustrated in Fig.6. The drug (1 μm) accelerated the fast component in I Ba decay of α1Lc/β1a from τfast, control= 415 ± 52 ms to τfast, isradipine = 166 ± 9 ms (n = 7). In α1Lc/β2a and V1504A channels I Ba inactivation developed with slow time constants of 16 ± 2 s (α1Lc/β2a) and 12 ± 2 s (V1504A,n = 5), indicating complete absence of intrinsic fast inactivation (see also corresponding recovery experiments in Fig.7). (+)-Isradipine induced in both channel constructs a transient component in the current decay with similar time constants of τfast, isradipine(V1504A) = 215 ± 35 ms and τfast, isradipine(α1Lc/β2a) = 210 ± 30 ms (n = 5). The slow inactivation time constants of theI Ba decay were not significantly affected by the drug (see right column of Fig. 6 and inset in Fig. 6 A).Figure 7Recovery from isradipine-induced inactivation.

Smooth curves in A–D represent mono- or biexponential functions fitted to I Barecovery (means ± S.E., n = 4–7) of α1Lc/β1, I1498A, α1Lc/β2, and V1504A channels in control (○) and in 1 μm (+)-isradipine (●).

Irrespective of the changes in channel inactivation in I1498A channels, drug-induced acceleration of the current occurred at a similar rate as in α1Lc/β1a channels (τfast, isradipine = 142 ± 18 ms,n = 6, Fig. 6, A and C). Thus, (+)-isradipine-induced acceleration of the current decay occurred in all L-type channel constructs at a comparable rate. I Ba recovery of α1Lc/β1a channels at −80 mV was well described by a monoexponential function (τrec, control = 0.65 ± 0.07 s, n = 6; Fig. 7 A). Recovery in the presence of 1 μm (+)-isradipine was about four times slower (τrec, drug = 2.80 ± 0.14 s, n = 4; Fig. 7, A and E), suggesting that the drug promotes a new (drug-induced) inactivated state. Regardless of the complete absence of intrinsic “fast inactivation” in α1Lc/β2a and V1504A channels (Fig. 6,B and D), (+)-isradipine (1 μm) induced a transient component in I Ba decay and a corresponding fast component in recovery with kinetics comparable with drug-modulated α1Lc/β1a channels (τrec, drug [α1Lc/β2a] = 2.26 ± 0.26 s, n = 3 and τrec, drug [V1504A] = 1.48 ± 0.48 s,n = 5; Fig. 7, C–E). Mutant I1498A recovered with biexponential kinetics in control (Fig.7 B). (+)-Isradipine enhanced the impact of the fast component (Fig. 7 F). However, the drug did not slow the time course of I Ba recovery in I1498A channels. Neither the recovery time constant from fast inactivation nor recovery from slow inactivation were significantly affected by (+)-isradipine (τrec, control = 471 ± 50 ms, τrec, drug = 453 ± 45 ms, n = 4; see also Fig. 7, B and E). Recovery of I1498A channels from inactivation in the presence of (+)-isradipine occurred at a 6-fold faster rate the recovery of α1Lc/β1a channels, suggesting a particularly important role of Ile1498 in stabilization of the DHP-induced inactivated state. According to a widely accepted hypothesis, DHPs bind with high affinity to the inactivated state of Ca2+ channels (15.Bean B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6388-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar,16.Sanguinetti M.C. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 1984; 55: 336-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). We have revisited this concept and analyzed the (+)-isradipine sensitivity of several L-type and DHP-sensitive class A Ca2+ channel constructs with different inactivation properties. Our data clearly demonstrate that two putative DHP binding determinants in segment IVS6 (Ile1497and Ile1498; Ref. 11.Peterson B.Z. Tanada T.N. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5293-5296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) form part of the L-type channel inactivation mechanism (Fig. 3 A). Alanine substitutions of these amino acids slowed I Ba inactivation and increased the apparent DHP sensitivity at −80 mV (Fig. 3). Slowing the kinetics of α1Lc channels by coexpression of the β2a-subunit had no significant effect onI Ba inhibition (Figs. 1 and 3). However, neither co-expression of the different α1Lc mutants with the β2a-subunit nor introducing point mutations into segment IVS6 significantly affected the steady state fraction of channels in the inactivated state at −80 mV. Our measurements of drug action at −80 mV therefore primarily provided information about an enhanced resting state affinity of constructs I1497A, I1498A, and V1504A. As illustrated in Fig. 2, we estimated at −80 mV an about 3-fold larger fraction of α1A-DHP/β1a channels in steady state inactivation than in α1A-DHP/β2a. Despite this marked difference, α1A-DHP/β1a and α1A-DHP/β2a channels were blocked with similar IC50 values (α1A-DHP/β1a, 61 ± 14; α1A-DHP/β2a, 52 ± 14;p > 0.05). This result is hard to explain in the frame of a modulated receptor model suggesting high affinity drug binding to the inactivated channel conformation. Instead, our data clearly demonstrate that β-subunit-induced changes in the steady state fraction of channel inactivation at −80 mV have no significant effect on (+)-isradipine sensitivity of α1A-DHP channels. A higher sensitivity of mutant α1A-DHP/β1a (IC50 = 61 ± 14) compared with the L-type construct α1Lc/β1a (IC50 = 327 ± 41, p < 0.01) therefore cannot be explained by a high affinity block of a larger fraction of α1A-DHP channels in an inactivated state. A loss in voltage dependence of DHP block caused by the class A sequence environment of the DHP-binding site in α1A-DHP cannot be excluded. Next we exploited the different inactivation properties of our L-type Ca2+ channel constructs to analyze whether a larger steady state fraction of inactivated channels at −30 mV would enhance voltage-dependent channel block. As shown in Fig. 4 D, we observed even a reversed correlation between these two parameters. This apparent discrepancy with a high affinity drug binding mechanism to the inactivated channel state is also illustrated in Fig. 5. Removal of fast inactivation in V1504A and in α1Lc/β2a channels substantially reduced the fraction of inactivated channels during the 30-s conditioning pulses compared with α1Lc/β1a (Fig. 5,A–C). We observed, however, no correlation between the shifts in the midpoint voltages of the inactivation curves in the presence of 10 nm to 1 μm (+)-isradipine (Table I) and the amount of inactivation during a 30-s conditioning test pulse (more than 90% in α1Lc/β1achannels versus about 70% in α1Lc/β2a and V1504A channels). These data suggest that drug binding to the inactivated state is less crucial for L-type channel block than previously supposed. The kinetics of the voltage-dependent channel block by (+)-isradipine at −30 mV support, however, the hypothesis that the drug promotes a conformational state resembling intrinsic fast inactivation (Fig. 4, A and B). As demonstrated in Fig. 4, the formation of this “drug-induced inactivated state” was modulated by intrinsic determinants of fast inactivation in segment IVS6 and α1-β-subunit interaction. At 20 mV (+)-isradipine (1 μm) accelerated theI Ba decay of all L-type channel constructs to a comparable extent (Fig. 6). At this potential drug-induced acceleration of the current decay could be due to rapid open channel block (21.Lacinova L. Hofmann F. Receptors Channels. 1998; 6: 153-164PubMed Google Scholar), drug-induced inactivation, or both. It is tempting to speculate that the (+)-isradipine-induced acceleration of the current decay at 20 mV at least partially reflects drug-induced transitions of open channels to an inactivated state that was observed for resting channels at −30 mV (Fig. 4, A and B). However, state transitions of resting channels at −30 mV cannot be extrapolated to 20 mV, where inactivation occurs predominantly from the open state. More detailed studies including an analysis of the dose dependence of (+)-isradipine-induced changes in I Ba kinetics at different membrane voltages are required to answer this question. As shown in Fig. 7, constructs α1Lc/β2a (τrec, drug = 2.26 ± 0.23 s, n = 5) and V1405A (τrec, drug = 1.48 ± 0.48 s,n = 4) recovered from the drug-induced inactivation with slightly faster time constants than α1Lc/β1a (τrec, drug = 2.80 ± 0.14 s, n = 4, p = 0.05). Most dramatic effects were observed for amino acid substitution I1498A. This mutant recovered in (+)-isradipine much faster from inactivation (τrec, drug = 0.45 ± 0.05 s,n = 4) than α1Lc/β1a and the other constructs (Fig. 7 E). This property distinguishes Ile1498 from other IVS6 residues investigated in the present study (Fig. 7 B). A simple interpretation of these results is that mutation I1498A and to a lesser extent mutation V1405A and the α1Lc-β2a interaction destabilize the drug-induced inactivated state (Fig.8). A role of channel inactivation determinants in different sequence stretches of L-type and non-L-type α1-subunits in block by DHPs was earlier reported by Zuhlke et al. (22.Zuhlke R.D. Bouron A. Soldatov N.M. Reuter H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), Lacinova et al. (23.Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Hu M. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and Bodi et al. (24.Bodi I. Yamaguchi H. Hara M. He M. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24952-24960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An interesting question about the interaction of DHPs with Ca2+ channels is whether these drugs bind with high affinity to the inactivated state or whether the inactivation gating of the channels in their drug-bound form is changed. In his original work on the modulated receptor hypothesis, Hille (25.Hille B. Biophysical Aspects of cardiac Muscle. (Academic Press), 1978: 55-73Crossref Google Scholar) stressed both ways of expressing the concept of the modulated receptor hypothesis. The aim of the present study was to distinguish the impact of drug binding to the inactivated state from drug-induced inactivation by making use of DHP-sensitive Ca2+ channel constructs with different inactivation properties. We report here almost identical (+)-isradipine sensitivity of α1A-DHP/β1aand α1A-DHP/β2a channels despite the pronounced differences in steady state inactivation (Fig. 2). For our L-type mutants, we observed at −30 mV even a reversed correlation between the different channel fractions in inactivation and voltage-dependent channel block (Fig. 4 D). Both findings are inconsistent with a modulated receptor mechanism implying an interdependence between high affinity DHP-binding to Ca2+ channels in an inactivated state and drug-induced inactivation. We hypothesize that drug-induced changes in the availability curve reflect the formation of a new (+)-isradipine-induced inactivated channel conformation. Recovery from drug-induced inactivation is modulated by intrinsic inactivation determinants, suggesting a synergism between both processes (most prominent for mutation I1498A). The possible structural implications of our data are hard to interpret. On one hand, this interrelationship may indicate that conformational changes during channel inactivation modulate the orientation of DHP-binding determinants; on the other hand, they may also reflect an overlap between drug binding and inactivation determinants (see Fig. 8 for illustration). In conclusion, DHP-sensitive Ca2+ channel constructs with different inactivation properties represent valuable tools for studying the role of the inactivated channel conformation in DHP block. The characterization of the drug-induced inactivated conformational state(s) and the identification of further structural links between the DHP-binding sites and intrinsic channel inactivation is an exciting subject for future mutational studies.

This coiled-coil trigger pattern was demonstrated to be indispensable for the assembly of the oligomerization domain of the actin-bundling protein cortexillin I from Dictyostelium discoideum and the leucine zipper domain of the yeast transcriptional activator GCN4. With the aim to extend our knowledge on trigger sequences we have investigated the human macrophage scavenger receptor type A oligomerization domain as a representative of three-stranded coiled coils. We prepared a variety of recombinant N- and C-terminal deletion mutants from the full-length oligomerization domain by heterologous gene expression in Escherichia coli and assessed their ability to form trimeric coiled-coil structures by circular dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation. Deletion mapping identified a distinct seven-residue sequence that was absolutely required for proper coiled-coil formation, supporting our previous results that heptad repeats alone are not sufficient for oligomerization. The finding that all fragments containing this particular sequence exhibited similar thermal stabilities indicates primarily a stabilizing function of the coiled-coil trigger. Based on sequence similarity, we suggest that functionally related sites are present in other three-stranded coiled-coil proteins."

RyRs are activated during ECC by a signal originating in l-type Ca2+ channels (dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs)). The α1 subunit of the DHPR contains charged residues in its S4 segment that sense plasmalemma or transverse tubule depolarization and either open the DHPR Ca2+ channel to allow the influx of Ca2+ ions, which activate RyRs in cardiac muscle, or initiate a protein-protein interaction with the RyR in skeletal muscle. The loop between the second and third repeats (II-III loop) of the skeletal DHPR is required for skeletal ECC, which is independent of cytoplasmic Ca2+ (1.Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T.

J. 1999; 77: 189-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A peptide A1/II-III loop interaction site on the skeletal RyR between Arg1076 and Asp1112 has also been reported (8.Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The peptide A1 region may be necessary for the DHPR II-III loop to bind to the RyR, whereas other regions of the loop are necessary for the transmission of the ECC signal from the S4 part of the DHPR to the II-III loop/RyR binding region (7.Dulhunty A.F. Laver D.R. Gallant E.M. Casarotto M.G. Pace S.M. Curtis S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 189-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Evidence for this hypothesis is that the cardiac DHPR can support skeletal type ECC when the peptide A region contains the cardiac sequence, provided that residues 725–742 contain the skeletal sequence (9.Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24983-24986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), suggesting that (a) both cardiac and skeletal peptide A1 regions bind to the RyR, and (b) residues 725–742 are essential for transmission of the ECC (7.Dulhunty A.F. Laver D.R. Gallant E.M. Casarotto M.G. Pace S.M. Curtis S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 189-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). If this hypothesis is correct, activation of RyR channels by peptide A1 or by the II-III loop may reflect binding to the RyR, rather than activation equivalent to ECC. The hypothesis is supported by the fact that the full cardiac II-III loop activated skeletal RyRs (3.Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,4.Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18459-18464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Two regions of peptide A1 are important in its interaction with RyRs. The highly charged 681RKRRK685 sequence is essential for RyR activation by peptide A1 (6.El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10.Zhu X. Gurrola G. Jiang M.T. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and Ser687 is important, although its precise role is not clear. The II-III loop does not activate RyRs when Ser687is either phosphorylated or replaced by alanine (4.Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18459-18464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, replacement of Ser687 with Ala increases the ability of peptide A1 to activate RyRs (7.Dulhunty A.F. Laver D.R. Gallant E.M. Casarotto M.G. Pace S.M. Curtis S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 189-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas a similar replacement in a 25-amino acid peptide (Glu666–Pro690) reduces [3H]ryanodine binding (11.Gurrola G.B. Arevalo C. Sreekumar R. Lokuta A.J. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7879-7886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The different effects of Ser687 to Ala substitution are likely to reflect structural differences between peptides of different lengths. The structure of the protein-protein interaction sites on the II-III loop and on the RyR must be understood in order to comprehend these functional observations and the structural changes that could occur during ECC. Neither structure has been determined. Here, we address the structural basis for Ca2+ release from the SR by the native DHPR sequence from Thr671–Leu690 (peptide A1) and the enhanced ability of peptide A2 (S687A substitution) to release Ca2+from skeletal SR and to activate skeletal RyRs. We determined the solution structures for three peptides using NMR spectroscopy. These peptides are a small, seven-residue peptide encompassing the basic region essential for RyR activation (A9), peptide A1 (containing Ser687), and peptide A2 (containing a S687A substitution). The results show that the smaller A9 peptide is unstructured, whereas both peptides A1 and A2 have a propensity to form helical structures at their N-terminal end. The C-terminal part of A1 is highly mobile, whereas the C-terminal part of A2 is more constrained. Because we find that A9 is not effective in releasing Ca2+ from SR or in activating RyR channels, the relative activity of the three peptides is closely correlated with their helical content. DHPR II-III loop peptides were synthesized as described by Dulhunty et al. (7.Dulhunty A.F. Laver D.R. Gallant E.M. Casarotto M.G. Pace S.M. Curtis S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 189-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Test peptides were as follows: A1, Thr671- Ser-Ala-Gln-Lys-Ala-Lys-Ala-Glu-Glu-Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg-Lys-Met- Ser-Arg-Gly-Leu690; A2, Thr671-Ser-Ala-Gln-Lys-Ala-Lys-Ala-Glu-Glu-Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg-Lys-Met-Ala-Arg-Gly-Leu690; and A9, Arg681-Lys-Arg-Arg-Lys-Met-Ser687. Optimum NMR conditions were established after multiple trials with various salt and pH conditions. For final NMR studies, all peptides were dissolved in water containing 10%/90% D2O/H2O to a final concentration of 4 mm and adjusted to pH 5.0. All spectra were acquired on a Varian-Inova 600 spectrometer using a spectral width of 6000 Hz, a pulse width of 7 ms (90°), and acquisition time of 0.130 s, collecting 2048 data points and 512 increments of 32 transients.

Commun. 1983; 117: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar) spectra were acquired at 278 K and used for the assignment of the 1H NMR resonances. Suppression of the H2O resonance for the NOESY and DQF-COSY spectra was achieved using pulse field gradients (16.Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biolmol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3536) Google Scholar, 17.Trimble L.A. Bernstein M. J. Magn.

Temperature coefficients (18.Deslauriers R. Smith I.C.P. Biological Magnetic Resonance. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1980: 243-344Crossref Google Scholar) and hence the patterns of backbone hydrogen bonding were assessed by monitoring the chemical shift values of the amide backbone protons with changes in temperature (277, 285, and 298 K) in the DQF-COSY experiments. The two-dimensional data were processed on an O2 Silicon Graphics work station using the Felix 95 software package. Data sets were zero-filled to 4096 by 2048 K and multiplied by a phase-shifted sine-bell-squared function in both dimensions prior to transformation. An internal standard, 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was used as a chemical shift reference (0.00 ppm). 3JNH-αH coupling constants were derived from one-dimensional 1H spectra where possible and/or fitted from one-dimensional slices extracted from DQF-COSY spectra. Distance constraints were derived manually from a two-dimensional NOESY spectrum acquired with a mixing time of 200 ms. Upper bounds were derived from NOE cross-peak intensities by counting the number of contour levels of nonoverlapped cross-peaks and using distances calibrated from Gln γ-methylene protons. NOE signals were classified into four categories of upper distance limits of 2.7 3.5, 4.5, and 5.8 Å and lower distance limits of 1.9 Å in all cases. Dihedral angle restraints based on the3JNH-Hα measurements were included in the final calculations, with a tolerance of 20°. Structure calculations were performed with the X-PLOR program (19.Brünger A.T. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Karplus M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3801-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 20.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using the simulated annealing protocol on a Silicon Graphics O2 workstation. The “topallhdg.pro” topology file and “parallhdg.pro” parameter file within the program were used. The sum averaging option was used to treat equivalent and nonstereospecifically assigned protons. Calculations were conducted iteratively by checking violations after each round and adding or refining constraints accordingly. Hydrogen bonds were identified and introduced after initial calculations. These were simulated by two distance constraints: a 3.3-Å restraint between the amide nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen and a 2.3-Å restraint between the amide hydrogen and the carbonyl oxygen. Initially, 100 fully extended structures with random coordinates were generated. Following the calculations, structures were analyzed, and 20 were selected on the basis of distance and dihedral constraint violations and low energies. None of the 20 structures had NOE violations greater than 0.5 Å or dihedral violations greater than 5°. For structural comparisons, individual structures from the ensemble were superimposed onto the average structure. Peptide modeling was performed using the MSI software Insight 97 and the α-helix predicted by the Chou-Fasman algorithm (21.Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar) modeled on an extended structure. The extended structure was then minimized by the program Discover, firstly by steepest descent and finally by the conjugate gradient method until the maximum derivative was less than 0.001 kcal/Å. Rabbit skeletal SR vesicles were prepared, Ca2+ release from SR measured, and single channel experiments performed as described by Laver et al. (22.Laver D.R. Roden L.D. Ahern G.P. Eager K.R. Junankar P.R. Dulhunty A.F. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 147: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and Dulhunty et al. (7.Dulhunty A.F. Laver D.R. Gallant E.M. Casarotto M.G. Pace S.M. Curtis S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 189-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Ca2+ release from SR vesicles partially loaded with Ca2+ was measured using antipyralazo III as a Ca2+ indicator. In bilayer experiments, SR vesicles and peptides were added to the cischamber. Bilayer potential is expressed as V cis– V trans, (i.e. V cytoplasm – V lumen). RyR channel activity was recorded using a cis solution containing 230 mm cesium methanesulphonate, 20 mm CsCl, 100 μm CaCl2 and 10 mm N-tris(hyroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (TES, pH 7.4, with CsOH) and a trans solution containing 230 mm cesium methanesulphonate, 20 mm CsCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm TES (pH 7.4). RyR channel activity was recorded over a range of peptide concentrations at +40 mV and –40 mV. Potential was changed every 30 s, and activity was recorded (and currents were measured) for 2 min under control conditions and after each addition of peptide to thecis chamber. Peptides A1 and A2 activate Ca2+ release from skeletal SR and skeletal RyR channels (7.Dulhunty A.F. Laver D.R. Gallant E.M. Casarotto M.G. Pace S.M. Curtis S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 189-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Peptide A2 releases Ca2+ from SR vesicles at rates that are substantially greater than rates of release induced by A1 (Fig. 1 A). Peptide A2 produces 2-fold greater activation than A1 at +40 mV (Fig.1 C). In contrast to A1 and A2, the shorter 7-amino acid peptide containing the essential basic residues had little effect on Ca2+ release from SR (Fig. 1 A) and failed to activate RyR channels (Fig. 1 B). Indeed, RyR activity was less than control in the presence of the peptides. The decrease in activity reflects the inhibitory action of the peptide, which is also seen as a decline in activation of single channels by A1 and A2 at [peptide] greater than 10 nm. This inhibitory action of the peptide is not seen in Ca2+ release from SR vesicles. The average mean current flowing through RyRs at +40 mV and –40 mV did not increase after addition of A9 at any peptide concentration up to 50 μm. The relative abilities of the peptides to release Ca2+ from the SR and to activate RyRs was A2 > A1 > A9. The different concentration dependence of activation of Ca2+ release from SR vesicles (i.e. activation of RyRs in vesicles) and activation of single RyR channels in bilayers has also been reported for the effects of the full II-III loop on RyR activity (3.Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18459-18464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The complete proton assignments for A1 and A2 are presented in TableI and were determined using standard two-dimensional methods (23.Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar), which involved two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy and DQF-COSY experiments to identify spin types and NOESY experiments to make sequence specific assignments. An illustration of the quality of the spectra is shown for the amide region of the A1 peptide (Fig. 2). Because the relative strength of NOE cross-peaks indicates the spatial proximity of two protons, the numerous strong NOE cross-peaks between backbone amide protons are suggestive of the presence of an helix-like structure. Short and medium range NOE patterns,3JNH-Hα coupling constants, α-proton chemical shift index (CSI), and hydrogen bonding information are summarized in Fig. 3. The presence of not only strong NH-NH NOE connectivities but that of weak NHi-NHi+ 2, αHi-NHi+ 3, and αHi-βHi+ 3 cross-peaks support the formation of a helix in both of these peptides. JNH-Hαcoupling constants <6 Hz and temperature coefficients >–2.0 were noted for several residues between 671 and 685, whereas the upfield shift of the α-protons is also compatible with a helix-type structure (24.Wishart D.S.

This is most clearly seen in Fig. 3, where additional medium range NOEs (NHi-NHi+ 2, αHi-NHi+ 3, and αHi-βHi+ 3) are observed for A2 compared with the A1 peptide, particularly for the basic region stretching from Arg681 to Lys685. More modest changes are observed for the NOEs at the C-terminal end of the peptide; this is accompanied by slight differences in the temperature coefficients, as well as the chemical shift index, for this region. NMR analysis was also carried out the A9 peptide. Complete assignment of the side chains was not possible due to the high degree of peak overlap. However, based on NOESY/rotating frame NOE spectroscopy cross-peak patterns, temperature coefficients (<–2.0),3JNH-Hα coupling constants (>6 Hz), and chemical shift index data (data not shown), it is apparent that this peptide possesses little if any structure. Analysis of the NOESY spectra gave rise to a total of 216 and 236 distance constraints for peptides A1 and A2, respectively, the details of which are summarized in Table II. Apart from the medium range NOEs, which are synonymous with helical structure, several side chain-side chain NOEs were detected for residue pairs Gln674–Lys677, Glu679–Lys682, and Glu680–Arg684. Backbone dihedral constraints were also included in the structure calculations, in which it was shown that the 3JNH-Hα coupling constant, temperature coefficient, and CSI data supported this constraint.Table IISummary of restraints, structural statistics, and atomic root mean square deviations for the family of 20 calculated lowest energy structures of peptide A1 and A2RestraintsPeptide A1Peptide A2Total NOEs212237Intra106118i −i + 15553i − i + 151663JNH-Hα76Hydrogen bonds43Atomic rmsd (Å)aStandard deviation is given in parentheses. backbonebN, Cα, and CO atoms.

Open table in a new tab The structural statistics including average energies and rmsd values for peptides A1 and A2 are summarized in Table II. This shows that for the 20 calculated lowest energy structures, peptide A2 has a slightly smaller overall backbone rmsd value, whereas the converse is true for residues 671–680. However, when an additional 5 residues were examined, the rmsd values for residues 671–685 were marginally smaller for A2, suggesting that the helical structure of the basic region (681–685) was more ordered in A2. Fig. 4shows the superposition of the 20 lowest energy structures for peptides A1 and A2. None of the structures had distance violations greater than 0.5 Å or dihedral violations greater than 5°. In both structures, helical segments are observed extending from the N-terminal ends to residue 685, with the remaining residues being disordered. It is clear that the A2 peptide has a more defined helical structure, particularly toward the N-terminal helix end. Structural models of A1 and A2 were created using the program Insight II (MSI) and energy minimized using the default consistent valence force field (Discover) to predict the lowest energy conformation. The resulting structures are depicted in Fig. 5 and, in general, both models show good correlation with the experimentally derived NMR structures. The key features for both peptides is the α-helical region extending from the N terminus to Lys685. A key difference between the A1 and A2 peptides is seen toward the C terminus, where the hydroxyl group of Ser687 (A1) is capable of interacting with the helix via the guanidino group of Arg683. Substitution of Ser687 for Ala in A2 precludes the possibility of such an interaction, and the C terminus extends away from the helix (see Fig.5). Structural analysis by NMR of the A1 and A2 peptides indicates that these small segments of the II-III loop are capable of forming well defined helical structures in water without the aid of helix stabilizing/promoting agents, such as trifluoroethanol or SDS. We avoided the use of such agents so that we could directly correlate the structure with functional effects of these peptides on RyRs. The structures of A1 and A2 correlate well with the predicted model structures presented here but were substantially different from the previously predicted structures (10.Zhu X. Gurrola G. Jiang M.T. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The NMR data indicated that A1 and A2 consist of a helical segment extending from the N terminus to residue Lys685, which is then followed by an unstructured region through to the C terminus. In both A1 and A2, the basic residues Arg681–Lys685, which are essential for peptide A1 activation of RyRs (6.El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Go"

The two stereospecifically modified DNAs and the corresponding unmodified DNA were ligated into a single-stranded M13mp7L2 vector and transfected intoEscherichia coli. Both stereoisomeric forms (R,R and S,S) of the DNA cross-links resulted in very severely decreased plaque-forming ability, along with an increased mutagenic frequency for both single base substitutions and deletions compared with unadducted DNAs, with the S,Sstereoisomer being the most mutagenic. Consistent with decreased plaque formation, in vitro replication of DNA templates containing the cross-links by the three major E. coli polymerases revealed replication blockage by both stereoisomeric forms of the cross-links. The same DNAs that were used for replication studies were also assembled into duplex DNAs and tested as substrates for the initiation of nucleotide excision repair by the E. coliUvrABC complex.

As a bifunctional electrophile, butadiene diepoxide is theoretically capable of producing inter- and intrastrand DNA-DNA cross-links. Cross-linked adducts are thought to be responsible for the observation that the diepoxide is considerably more mutagenic in mice than the monoepoxide under identical exposure conditions (1.de Meester C. Mutat. Res. 1988; 195: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and for the fact that butadiene is more genotoxic to mice than rats. The latter observation is attributed to the greater effectiveness of mice at metabolizing butadiene to the diepoxide (2.Henderson R.F. Thornton-Manning J.R. Bechtold W.E. Dahl A.R. Toxicology. 1996; 113: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both species appear to be equally susceptible to cytogenetic damage inflicted by butadiene diepoxide when the epoxide is introduced directly into isolated rat or mouse lymphocytes (splenic or peripheral blood) (3.Kligerman A.D. DeMarini D.M. Doerr C.L. Hanley N.M. Milholland V.S. Tennant A.H. Mutat. Res. 1999; 439: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). There are a number of studies supporting the existence of butadiene diepoxide-induced interstrand cross-links (4.Verly W.G. Brakier L. Feit P.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 228: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5.Verly W.G. Brakier L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 174: 674-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6.Jelitto B.

Evidence for such cross-links is based largely on denaturation/renaturation experiments in which interstrand-cross-linked DNA renatures more rapidly than noncross-linked. The only cross-linked species thus far identified, a guanine N7-guanine N7 cross-link, was isolated from salmon sperm DNA by Lawley and Brookes (8.Lawley P.D. Brookes P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 25: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In 1993, Millard and White (10.Millard J.T. White M.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2120-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) reported that synthetic oligonucleotide duplexes of varying sequences reacted rather diffusely with butadiene diepoxide but showed preference for interstrand cross-linking at 5′-GNC sites. As expected for guanine N7 cross-links most of the bands that migrated in denaturing gels in the region expected for dimeric structures were cleavable by piperidine at 90 °C. However, some cross-linked material persisted after the alkaline treatment indicating that stable cross-links (of unknown structure) were also formed. Interstrand cross-links are known to be highly cytotoxic, whereas intrastrand cross-links tend to be more mutagenic (11.Roberts J.J. Thomson A.J. Prog Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1979; 22: 71-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 12.Skladanowski A. Konopa J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 2269-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13.Yarema K.J. Lippard S.J. Essigmann J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4066-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although certain types of intrastrand cross-links such as those arising from pyrimidine photodimerization and the chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin and mitomycin, have been well studied, the question of intrastrand cross-link formation by butadiene diepoxide has not been examined; in theory the guanine N7-guanine N7 cross-link that has been isolated could arise from an intrastrand as well as an interstrand cross-link. We decided to focus on possible stable intrastrand cross-links, because little is known about the replication and repair of aliphatic intrastrand cross-links. Inasmuch as we had data on replication and mutagenicity of butadiene diolepoxide monoadducts on guanine N2 for comparison (14.Carmical J.R. Zhang M. Nechev L. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Lloyd R.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we chose guanine N2-guanine N2 cross-links as our first target. Furthermore, we knew from other experiments 1A. Kowalczyk, unpublished data. that a cross-link involving adjacent guanines connected N2 to N2 by an unsubstituted 4-carbon alkyl chain introduces very little distortion into the double helix. Such a lesion might escape detection by repair enzymes and lead to mutations if it were replicated. Hence 8-mer oligonucleotides were synthesized containing site-specific guanine N2-guanine N2 cross-links of (R,R) and (S,S) butadiene diepoxide in theN-ras codon 12 (-GGT-) sequence. To better understand what roles such adducts might play in molecular mechanisms responsible for butadiene-induced carcinogenesis, replication efficiency and mutagenic spectra have been investigated, as well as the initiation of repair by the UvrABC exinuclease complex. These data suggest that intrastrand butadiene cross-links may contribute significantly to the mutagenic spectrum observed in butadiene-exposed animals. Oligonucleotides were prepared on an Expedite™ 8909 Nucleic Acid Synthesizer usingtert-butyl-phenoxyacetyl 2-cyanoethyl phosphoramidites and the modified phosphoramidite of 2-fluoro-O 6-trimethylsilylethyl (TMSE)2-5′-O-dimethoxytrityl 2′-deoxyinosine on a 1 μmol scale. Modified oligonucleotides were deprotected and purified as described previously (15.DeCorte B.L. Tsarouhtsis D. Kuchimanchi S. Cooper M.D. Horton P. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HPLC purifications were done on a Beckman HPLC (System Gold software, model 125 pump, model 168 photodiode array detector). Oligonucleotides were desalted on Sephadex G-25 using a Bio-Rad FPLC system. Enzymatic digestion mixtures (0.2–0.5 A 260 units of oligonucleotide, 20 μl of buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl and 0.01 m MgCl2, pH 7), and 3.2 units of nuclease P1 (Sigma N-8630) were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, and then 20 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, 0.04 unit of snake venom phosphodiesterase (Sigma 5785), and 0.4 unit of alkaline phosphatase (Sigma P-4282) were added and incubation at 37 °C continued overnight) were analyzed by HPLC (4.6 × 250-mm YMC ODS-AQ column) with the following gradient: (A) 0.1 mammonium formate and (B) CH3CN, 1–10% B over 15 min, 10–20% B over 5 min, hold for 5 min, and then to 100% B over 10 min at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 300.13 and 400.13 MHz on Bruker AC300 and AM400 NMR spectrometers in MeOD-d4 or Me2SO-d6. High resolution mass spectra were obtained in positive fast atom bombardment (FAB) mode on a VG 70–250 instrument or at the Mass Spectrometry Facility at the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana. Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy was carried out on a Finnigan TSQ-7000 mass spectrometer. Melting profiles were recorded on a Varian Cary 04E UV spectrophotometer. (-)-Dimethyl 2,3-O-benzylidene- l -tartrate (5 g) was dissolved in 150 ml of methanol. A slow stream of ammonia (gas) was bubbled through this solution for 3–4 h. TLC (ethyl acetate:hexane, 2:1) showed complete disappearance of the starting material. The solvents were evaporated to give a clear oil, which crystallized under vacuum. The product (4.3 g, 97%) was used in the next step without purification. 1H NMR (methanol-d4) δ (ppm) 4.77 (m, 2H, 2xCH), 6.05 (s, 1H, CH-benzyl), 7.41 (m, 3H,m-, p-aromatic), 7.57 (m, 2H, o- aromatic).). HRMS (FAB+) m/z calculated for [M+H]+ 237.0875 found 237.0882. [α ]D20 was + 3.9° (c = 2, ethanol).

HRMS (FAB+) m/zcalculated for [M+H]+ 237.0875 found 237.0879. [α]D20 was − 3.1° (c = 2, ethanol). The (2R, 3R) 2,3-O-benzylidenetartramide from the previous step was dissolved in 15 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and added dropwise (10 min) to a stirring mixture of LiAlH4 (2 g) and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (150 ml). The reaction was carried out under argon. After stirring for 1 h at room temperature and under reflux for 5 h, complete disappearance of the starting material was observed. The reaction was followed by TLC (CH3CN:H2O:NH4OH, 85:8:7). Each aliquot was treated with water before loading on a TLC plate. The reaction was cooled (ice/water bath), and water was carefully added until the color of the precipitate became white. The mixture was filtered, diluted with ether, and dried over sodium sulfate. Solvents were evaporated, and the crude yellowish oil was purified (silica gel column; CH3CN:H2O:NH4OH, 85:8:7) to give 1.68 g (95%) of pure benzylidene-protected diamine.1H NMR (methanol-d4), δ (ppm) 2.88 (m, 4H, 2x CH2), 3.92 (m, 2H, 2x CH), 5.93 (s, 1H, CH-benzyl), 7.37 (m, 3H, m-, p-aromatic), 7.48 (m, 2H,o-aromatic).

(2S,3S)-2,3-O-Benzylidene-1,4-diamino-2,3-butanediol from the previous step (1 g) was neutralized with 1 N HCl to pH 6.0. The solution was evaporated to dryness (rotary evaporator, 40 °C). Sulfuric acid (0.01 N, 15 ml) was added, and the mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 3 h. The solution was evaporated to dryness. Water was then added and evaporated three times (to remove benzaldehyde). The product was dissolved in a small amount of water, and the pH was adjusted (1 N NaOH) to 12.0. The solution was evaporated to dryness. The mixture was dissolved in a small amount of boiling 80% ethanol. The insoluble inorganic salts were filtered out, and the filtrate was kept in a freezer for 1 h. The additional amounts of inorganic salts, which crystallized, were filtered out again, and the solvents were evaporated to give 0.46 g (80%) of the product, a clear oil, which crystallized upon standing. 1H NMR (methanol-d4), δ (ppm): 2.70 (m, 4H, 2xCH 2), 3.47 (m, 2H, 2xCH).

The above procedure using (2R,3R)-2,3-O-benzylidene-1,4-diamino-2,3-butanediol (1.8 g) as a starting material led to 0.85 g (82%) of (2R,3R)- 1,4-diamino-2,3-butanediol.1H NMR (methanol-d4), δ (ppm) 2.71 (m, 4H, 2xCH 2), 3.47 (m, 2H, 2xCH).

The general procedure was as follows. The starting material 5′-d(CATXXTCC)-3′ (1) (X = 2-fluoro-O 6-TMSE 2′-deoxyinosine) was reacted with the appropriate diaminediol in Me2SO in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) for 2–3 days at 55 °C. The reactions were monitored by HPLC on a C18 column (4.5 × 250 mm, YMC ODS-AQ) with the following gradient: (A) 0.1 m ammonium formate and (B) CH3CN, 1–35% B over 20 min, 35–90% B over 3 min, hold for 2 min, and then to 1% B over 2 min at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Starting material eluted at 21–22 min, and cross-linked products 2a and 2b eluted at ∼18–19 min (fully TMSE-protected), partially TMSE-protected products at ∼12–13 min, and final products 3a and 3b at ∼9–10 min (fully deprotected). For synthesis of this cross-link, 18 A 260 units of (1), 1 drop of DIEA, and 67 μl (1.5 equivalents) of a solution of (2R,3R)-1,4-diaminobutanediol (0.65 μg/μl) in Me2SO were used. After 3 days the starting material was consumed, and Me2SO was removed in vacuo. The crude reaction mixture was purified by HPLC on a C18 column (250 × 10 mm, YMC ODS-AQ) with the following gradient: (A) 0.1m ammonium formate and (B) CH3CN, 1–15% B over 21 min, 15–35% B over 12 min, 35–90%B over 8 min, hold for 2 min, and then to 1% B over 2 min at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Three cross-linked species were collected: fully TMSE-protected cross-link2a (isolated 4.2 A 260 units) eluted at ∼34 min, partially TMSE-protected (isolated 1.8A 260 units) at ∼28 min, and fully deprotected3a (isolated 1.2 A 260 units) at ∼19 min. Partially and fully TMSE-protected cross-linked products were combined and after lyophilization the TMSE-protecting groups were removed by treatment with aqueous acetic acid (pH 3) for 1 h at room temperature; the product coeluted with fully deprotected cross-link 3a. The reaction mixture was then neutralized and combined with 3a isolated previously. For synthesis of this cross-link, 13 A 260 units of (1), 1 drop of DIEA and 80 μl (2.5 equivalents) of a solution of (2S,3S)-1,4-diaminobutanediol (0.65 μg/μl) in Me2SO were used. The diaminediol solution was added in two increments over 24 h. After 2 days the starting material was consumed, and Me2SO was removed in vacuo. The crude reaction mixture was purified by HPLC as described above for3a. Three cross-linked species were collected: fully TMSE-protected cross-link 2b (isolated 3.6A 260 units) eluted at ∼34 min, partially TMSE-protected (isolated 1.2 A 260 units) at ∼28 min, and fully deprotected 3b (isolated 0.6A 260 units) at ∼19 min. Partially and fully TMSE-protected cross-linked products were combined, and after lyophilization the TMSE-protecting groups were removed by treatment with aqueous acetic acid (pH 3) for 2 h at room temperature; the product coeluted with fully deprotected cross-link 3b. The reaction mixture was then neutralized, combined with 3b, lyophilized, and repurified by HPLC on a C18 column (250 × 10 mm, YMC ODS-AQ) with the following gradient: (A) 0.1 m ammonium formate and (B) CH3CN, 3–13% B over 25 min, 13–90% B over 2 min, hold for 2 min, and then to 3% B over 2 min at a flow rate of 3 ml/min; the product (3b) eluted at ∼22 min. The HPLC-purified cross-linked oligonucleotides 3a and3b were desalted (Sephadex G-25) and analyzed by mass spectroscopy: electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy: (3a) calculated M r of 2471.7; measured mass based on [M+Na-2H]/2z 1246.0, [M+Na-3H]/3z 830.6, [M-3H]/3z 822.8 = 2471.4; (3b) calculated M r of 2471.7; measured mass based on [M+Na-2H]/2z 1245.7; [M-3H]/3z 822.8 = 2470.9. Capillary gel electrophoresis and enzymatic digestion to the constituent nucleosides were also used to confirm the purity and composition of 3aand 3b. Bisnucleoside standards for use in HPLC analysis of enzymatic digests were synthesized as described in the following section. A solution of the appropriate diamine, 2-fluoro-O6-TMSE 2′-deoxyinosine, and DIEA (molar ratio in order mentioned 1:3:2.5) in Me2SO was stirred at 55 °C for 30 h. The resulting solution was acidified with aqueous acetic acid to pH 4 to remove the TMSE groups and stirred at room temperature for 8 h. The reaction mixture was neutralized, lyophilized, and purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a C8(2) column (250 × 10 mm, Phenomenex) with the following gradient: (A) H2O and (B) CH3CN, 5–8% B over 5 min, 8–11% B over 11 min, 11–90% B over 2 min, hold for 3 min, and then 90–5% B over 2 min at a flow rate of 3 ml/min, both products eluted at 11.5–12.5 min. 2.7 mg (0.022 mmol) of (2R,3R)-1,4-diaminobutanediol, 25 mg (0.067 mmol) of 2-fluoro-O 6-TMSE 2′-deoxyinosine, and 7.1 mg (0.055 mmol) of DIEA in 50 μl of Me2SO afforded after purification 9.5 mg (68% yield) of the cross-linked 2R,3R nucleoside. 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6, 300 MHz) δ (ppm) 10.58 (br, 2H, NH-ring), 7.90 (s, 2H, H8), 6.46 (br, 2H, NH-exocyclic), 6.15 (m, 2H, H1′), 5.24 (d, 2H, 3′-OH, J = 3.9 Hz), 5.04 (d, 2H, CH-OH, J = 5.4 Hz), 4.85 (t, 2H, 5′-OH, J = 5.7 Hz), 4.33 (br, 2H, H3′), 3.79 (m, 2H, H4′), 3.63 (br, 2H, CH-OH), 3.54 (m, 4H, H5′, H5“, 2H CH 2-N), 3.27 (hidden under H2O peak in Me2SO, visible in HH-COSY), 2.54 (m, 2H, H2”, partially hidden under Me2SO peak, confirmed with HH-COSY), 2.18 (m, 2H, H2′).

Adducted oligonucleotides 3a and3b and the complementary strand (0.5A 260 units each) were dissolved in 1 ml of melting buffer (10 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 1.0m NaCl, 50 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.0). The sample vials were heated to 100 °C, maintained at that temperature for 3 min, and allowed to cool to room temperature. UV measurements were taken at 1-min intervals with a 1 °C/min temperature gradient with observation at 260 nm. The temperature was raised from 5 °C to 85 °C. The (R, R)-butadiene cross-link hadTm = 44 °C, (S,S)-butadiene cross-link hadTm = 30 °C, wild type duplex hadTm = 40 °C.

To visualize the efficiency of this reaction, 10 μl of the modified M13mp7L2 were separated on a 1.4% agarose gel via electrophoresis and monitored by ethidium bromide staining. The efficiency of these reactions was then quantitated using an Appligene Bioimager. Modified M13mp7L2 was used to transfect repair-deficient AB2480 (uvrA −, recA−)Escherichia coli cells via electroporation as previously reported (14.Carmical J.R. Zhang M. Nechev L. Harris C.M.

Subsequently, the electroporation mixture was plated on prewarmed LB broth agarose plates in the presence of 500 μl of AB2480 E. coli and 5 ml of top agar (LB + 0.7% agarose). Each plate was inverted and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The resulting plaques were then transferred to nitrocellulose filters in four successive lifts for each plate. These filters were then processed as described previously (14.Carmical J.R. Zhang M. Nechev L. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Lloyd R.S. Chem. Res.

Four oligodeoxynucleotide probes (17-mers) were synthesized to be directly complementary both 5′ and 3′ to the DNA surrounding and including the 8-nucleotide insert. The 17-mers were varied in the sequence identity of the nucleotide opposite the 3′-guanine of the cross-link, where each of the four possible nucleotides were incorporated. These 17-mer probes were radioactively labeled by incubating 1 μg of DNA with 0.30 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the supplier's protocol. One of each of the four nitrocellulose filters were labeled accordingly and subsequently hybridized with the radioactively labeled probes overnight. The hybridization conditions were such that only the perfectly hybridized complement would anneal. Radiolabeled probes were washed as described previously, and filters were exposed to autoradiographic film overnight. The adducted 8-mer oligodeoxynucleotides utilized in the construction of the modified M13 vector were also used to construct a 50-mer linear template. The template was constructed such that the adducted guanines were approximately centrally located, therefore providing a sufficient template for primer extensions. To construct the template, the unadducted or adducted 8-mers, a 22-mer 5′-flanking DNA, and a 20-mer 3′-flanking DNA were annealed to a 45-mer scaffold that was complementary to the 8-mer internally and to the respective ends of the flanking DNAs; this DNA served as a bridge to facilitate ligation of the individual oligodeoxynucleotides. Prior to oligonucleotide annealing, the 8-mers and 20-mer flanking sequences were phosphorylated at the 5′-end. To visualize the 50-mer ligation product and to aid in the purification, the 22-mer flank was phosphorylated with a 1:10 mixture of [γ-32P]ATP/ATP. Each component was then added in approximately equal molar concentrations and heated to 70 °C for 5 min. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and then incubated in ice slurry for 15 min. T4 DNA ligase (2000 units) was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 16 °C. The 50-mer ligation product was then gel-purified to remove the 45-mer scaffold, as described previously. Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized to serve as primers for replication of the 50-mer template. Three primers were designed such that they would anneal to specific sites on the templates, thus providing a 3′-hydroxyl at various distances relative to the adduct. In effect, the primers would simulate scenarios that a polymerase might encounter in vivo. The first positioned the 3′-hydroxyl one base prior to the adduct, which would simulate a “standing” start. The second positioned the 3′-hydroxyl four bases prior to the adduct, which would simulate a “running” start. Finally, the third primer placed the 3′-hydroxyl five bases beyond the adduct to determine any downstream effects. Each primer was phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase to affix a 5′-γ-32P label. Subsequently, each was diluted to a concentration of 50 fmol/μl and added to the 50-mer template in a ratio of 1:3 in the presence of the appropriate reaction salts. To promote proper annealing, the mixture was heated to 90 °C for 2 min and slowly cooled to room temperature. This reaction was carried out in triplicate for each template/primer combination. The polymerases assayed and suppliers were as follows: large fragment of polymerase I (Klenow exo−) was purchased from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA; polymerase II was provided by Drs. M. F. Goodman and L. Bloom, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; and polymerase III was supplied by Dr. Mike O'Donnell, Rockefeller University, New York, NY. Finally, the appropriate salts, 1 μm dNTPs, and the buffer specific for the polymerase being assayed were added to the template/primer complex in a total reaction volume of 9 μl. Individually, the polymerases were added at 2-fold molar excess of enzyme to DNA and allowed to proceed at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of loading buffer, consisting of formamide, xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue. The extension products were then analyzed by electrophoresis through a 15% polyacrylamide sequencing gel and visualized by exposing an autoradiographic film overnight. The 50-mer templates containing the butadiene cross-linked DNAs were constructed as above except the 5′-end was not labeled until immediately prior to use in incision and binding assays. A complementary 50-mer oligodeoxynucleotide was synthesized and subsequently gel-purified as described previously and used as the substrate for UvrABC binding and incision assays. Prior to annealing, each template was phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase incorporating a γ-32P label on the 5′-end. The labeled 50-mer templates were then annealed to the complement in individual reactions. A reaction mixture containing a 5-fold molar excess of complement (500 nmol:2500 nmol) and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 μm EDTA was heated to 85 °C and allowed to slowly cool to room temperature. The duplex formation was then gel-purified on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel. The aforementioned, double-stranded 50-mer substrates (5 nm) were incubated with E. coli UvrABC proteins (10 nm UvrA, 250 nm UvrB, and 50 nmUvrC) at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of UvrABC reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP). Prior to the addition of the DNA substrate, the Uvr subunits wer"

There also occur specific enzymes, such as the d-serine deaminase, which protects numerous organisms against the toxicity of d-serine (15.Cosloy S.D. McFall E. J.

In crude extracts of bacteria, yeast, and mammals, an enzyme activity capable of hydrolyzing the ester bond of d-Tyr-tRNA was observed very early (17.Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This activity, which is likely to recycle erroneously aminoacylated tRNATyr, was searched for because, at the same time, evidence had been gained thatEscherichia coli and Bacillus subtilistyrosyl-tRNA synthetases producedd-Tyr-tRNATyr in vitro (18.Calendar R. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19.Calendar R. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) Recently, the gene encoding the aboved-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase could be isolated fromE. coli (20.Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This gene, named dtd, corresponds to the yihZ open reading frame at 87.81 min on the E. coli genetic map. Disruption of the dtd gene established that its product accounts for more than 90% of the deacylase activity in crude extract. However, although thedtd gene is essential to afford protection against the toxicity of d-tyrosine added to the culture medium, it does not interfere with cell growth under standard conditions (20.Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A comparative sequence analysis revealed homologs of the E. coli dtd gene in several other bacteria as well as in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, in the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, in the higher plantArabidopsis thaliana, in mice, and in man. Such a ubiquitous character suggests the hydrolysis ofd-Tyr-tRNATyr to be a universal mechanism of defense against a harmful effect of d-tyrosine. However, before drawing such a conclusion, more cells have to be examined for the occurrence of a relationship betweend-Tyr-tRNATyr hydrolysis and protection againstd-tyrosine. In the present study, we functionally characterize the S. cerevisiae YDL219w gene, which codes for a protein showing 34% identity with the E. coli d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase. The YDL219w gene was amplified by PCR1 and cloned. Expression of this gene from a multicopy plasmid increasedd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity in crude extracts, whereas disruption of the chromosomal YDL219w gene decreased deacylase activity and exacerbated the sensitivity of S. cerevisiae to d-tyrosine. We propose the name ofDTD1 for the YDL219w gene. Brewer's yeast tRNA was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.l-[14C]tyrosine acceptance of this tRNA was 23 pmol/A 260.

This change did not modify the amino acid sequence of the protein produced. The plasmid pYES2-DTD1 was used to transform the yeast strain DBY2057 by the lithium acetate method (24.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of theDTD1 gene was performed by the PCR-based method of Wachet al. (25.Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar) using the kanMX cassette as a selectable marker. This cassette contains the kanamycin resistance gene of the E. coli transposon Tn903 fused to transcriptional and translational control sequences of the Ashbya gossypii TEF gene. Consequently, S. cerevisiaetransformants are efficiently selected because of their acquired resistance to Geneticin (G418) (26.Webster T.D. Dickson R.C. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 26: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment containing thekanMX cassette from plasmid pFA6-kanMX4, flanked by 40 base pairs of the target locus, was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides: AGCCAAGCATCTGTAGTCGTCGATTCAAAAGTTATTTCAACGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC and CCCTTCATTAGTTAAAGAGCAACTCATCATTGCGCCGAATATCGATG- AATTCGAGCTCG. The S. cerevisiae strain DBY2057 was transformed by the resulting PCR fragment using the lithium acetate method. Before plating on YPD-agar medium supplemented with 300 μg of Geneticin/ml, the cells were cultivated at 30 °C during 4 h with shaking. Disruption of the DTD1 gene in Geneticin-resistant clones was verified by PCR amplification of genomic DNA using oligonucleotides TGAAGATTGTCTTACAAAAAGTCAGCCAAGC and TTGGTCACTGTCAAGAATGATTGTAACGGG. One positive clone was named DBY2057ΔDTD1 and was used for further studies. S. cerevisiae tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was partially purified from strain YPALS (27.Plateau P. Fromant M. Schmitter J.M. Blanquet S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6892-6899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 30 °C in 2 liters of YPD medium and harvested by centrifugation for 35 min at 3000 × g. The pellet was suspended in a buffer (pH 7.8) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, at an optical density of 100 at 650 nm. Cells were disrupted by sonication (10 min, 0 °C). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 8000 ×g. Streptomycin was added to the supernatant at 30 g/l to precipitate nucleic acids. After centrifugation for 30 min at 8000 × g, the resulting supernatant was brought to 80% ammonium sulfate saturation, left to stand 1 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged for 30 min at 8000 × g. The pellet was dissolved in 20 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.75), containing 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A), and dialyzed against 2 liters of the same buffer. The resulting solution was diluted to reach 6 A 280 and was applied on a Q-Sepharose column (2.6 × 16 cm) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was eluted with a 1.25-liter linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer A. Fractions showing tRNATyr aminoacylation activity were pooled, concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (80% saturation), centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g, and dissolved in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The protein sample was then dialyzed against 1 liter of the same buffer and used for assaying tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase activity. Plasmid pYES2/GS-YGR185CY from Invitrogen contains the TYS1 (YGR185c) gene of S. cerevisiaecytoplasmic tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase fused at its 3′-end with a DNA sequence coding for a C-terminal V5 epitope tag and a polyhistidine tag (His6). The nucleotide sequence of the TYS1 gene cloned in this plasmid differed from the sequence in the genomic data base by two A→G substitutions located 873 and 1110 bases downstream from the A of the ATG initiation codon. To correct the gene sequence, a 480-base pair SalI/StuI fragment of the pYES2/GS-YGR185CY plasmid was deleted. For this purpose, the plasmid was digested by SalI, filled in, partially digested byStuI, and recircularized. Then, the resulting plasmid was digested by SalI and used to transform the yeast strain DBY2057 for recombination. A plasmid containing the wild-type insert sequence was named pYES2/GS-TYS1. The yeast clone harboring this plasmid was used for the preparation of His6-tagged tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. Cells were grown at 30 °C in 2 liters of minimal medium supplemented with 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% galactose, and 1% raffinose. Crude extract preparation, nucleic acid precipitation with streptomycin sulfate, and ammonium sulfate precipitation of proteins were performed as described above in the case of purification of native tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. The protein pellet was dissolved in 20 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 20 mm imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl, and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol (buffer B) and dialyzed against 2 liters of the same buffer. The resulting sample was applied on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column (1.3 × 1.7 cm) equilibrated in buffer B. After a 10-ml wash with buffer B at a flow rate of 0.13 ml/min, the column was eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from 20 to 300 mm imidazole in buffer B. Fractions showing tRNATyr aminoacylation activity were pooled and prepared for activity measurements as described for native protein. Using the above procedure, the His6-tagged tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was purified approximately 140-fold when compared with the crude extract. It was homogeneous according to SDS-PAGE analysis. Concentration of the His6-tagged tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was determined using a M r of 2 × 47,712 and a light absorption coefficient of 0.439 A 280units mg−1 ml, as deduced from the amino acid sequence. Measurements of initial rates ofd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity were performed in crude extracts as described earlier, using E. coli d-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr as substrate (20.Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to 1 pmol of d-Tyr-tRNATyr hydrolyzed/min. Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase activity was assayed during 10 min at 28 °C in 100 μl of a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5.3 mg/ml crude brewer's yeast tRNA, catalytic amounts of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, and indicated amounts of l-[14C]tyrosine (500 Ci/mol) or d-[3H]tyrosine (500 Ci/mol). The reaction was quenched by the addition of (i) 2.5 ml of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (5%, w/w) containing 0.5% tyrosine and (ii) 10 μl of carrier RNA from yeast (4 mg/ml). The precipitate was recovered on Whatman GF-C filters, and the retained radioactivity was measured in a Beckman LS1801 scintillation counter. One unit of enzyme initial activity corresponds to 1 pmol of tyrosine transferred onto the tRNA/min. Comparative analysis using the BLAST program revealed the presence in S. cerevisiae of a gene homologous to the E. coli dtd gene encodingd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase. This gene,DTD1 (or YDL219w), is located on chromosome IV and contains one intron of 71 base pairs. To investigate its function and physiological importance, the DTD1 gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into the yeast expression vector pYES2. In the resulting plasmid (pYES2-DTD1), the DTD1 gene was placed under the control of the Gal1 portion of the divergent GAL1/GAL10 promoter. Cells DBY2057 transformed by plasmid pYES2-DTD1 were cultivated in minimal medium with galactose as the carbon source, i.e.under conditions inducing full expression of the cloned gene.d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity in a crude extract of the transformed strain was increased 190-fold as compared with strain DBY2057 (Table II). When cells were grown in the presence of glucose, the presence of the plasmid pYES2-DTD1 increased the deacylase activity by a factor of 1.7 only. These results showed that thed-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity recovered in crude extracts followed the expected level of expression of the clonedDTD1 gene.Table IId-Tyr-tRNA Tyr deacylase activity in S. cerevisiae strainsStraind-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activityaOne unit corresponds to the enzyme activity capable of hydrolyzing 1 pmol ofd-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr/min under standard assay conditions.GlucosebYeast cells were grown in minimal medium (yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate) supplemented withl-proline (0.5 mg/ml) as nitrogen source and 2% glucose or galactose as carbon and energy source.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether the DTD1 protein was responsible for the previously reportedd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity in yeast crude extracts (17.Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the DTD1 gene was disrupted. For this purpose, the chromosomal gene of the S. cerevisiae haploid strain DBY2057 was interrupted by the kanMX cassette using a PCR-based procedure. The DTD1 gene inactivation led to a more than 10-fold decrease in the d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity in the crude extract (Table II). Remarkably, however, the inactivation did not affect the growth rate of yeast cells in rich YPD medium or minimal yeast nitrogen base medium. Thed-stereoisomers of various amino acids (d-histidine, d-methionine,d-serine, d-phenylalanine,d-leucine, d-alanine, d-tryptophan, and d-tyrosine) inhibit the growth of wild-type S. cerevisiae cells (28.Rytka J. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 121: 562-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These d-amino acids are imported into yeast cells by the general amino acid permease corresponding to the GAP1 gene (28.Rytka J. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 121: 562-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Woodward J.R. Kornberg H.L. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The activity of this permease is controlled through a double mechanism that involves a derepression of the GAP1 gene expression under limiting nitrogen conditions, on the one hand, and an inactivation of the permease activity by ammonium ions, on the other hand. As a result, the toxicity of d-amino acids is enhanced when cells are grown in a medium devoid of ammonium salts (30.Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31.Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 32.Jauniaux J.C. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Such observations led us to compare the toxicity of d-tyrosine in a minimal medium containing either l-proline or ammonium sulfate as the nitrogen source. Nitrogen starvation is known to induce the filamentous (pseudohyphal) growth of diploids of S. cerevisiae (33.Gimeno C.J. Fink G.R. Science. 1992; 257: 626Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 34.Gimeno C.J. Ljungdahl P.O. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Consequently, to avoid filamentation, we used haploid strains. On minimal medium agar plates supplemented with l-proline, the growths of the wild-type strain (DBY2057) and of thedtd1 mutant strain (DBY2057ΔDTD1) were identical. Upon addition of 30 μmd-tyrosine, a significant inhibition of the growth of the mutant colonies only was observed (Fig.1 A). At 300 μmd-tyrosine, the colony formation of either strain was strongly inhibited. On minimal medium agar plates containing ammonium sulfate, the growth of all strains became less sensitive to the presence ofd-tyrosine. This behavior reflects the inhibition of the GAP1 permease by ammonium ions (29.Woodward J.R. Kornberg H.L. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, a relatively stronger effect of d-tyrosine on the growth of the mutant strain (DBY2057ΔDTD1) was visible again (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, whatever the culture condition assayed, the dtd1 strain was more sensitive to d-tyrosine than the parentalDTD1 strain. To investigate further the relation between the toxicity ofd-tyrosine and the expression of the DTD1 gene, strains DBY2057 and DBY2057ΔDTD1 were transformed by either plasmid pYES2-DTD1 or control plasmid pYES2. An overexpression of theDTD1 gene harbored by the pYES2-DTD1 plasmid was ensured by the presence of galactose. Under this condition, the growths of strains DBY2057(pYES2-DTD1) and DBY2057ΔDTD1(pYES2-DTD1) became indistinguishable whatever the concentration of d-tyrosine in the solid medium (Fig. 2). In agreement with this observation, levels of overproducedd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity in extracts from the two strains were very similar (Table II). Therefore, the addition in trans of a plasmid-borne functionalDTD1 gene was enough to cure the specific sensitivity of strain DBY2057ΔDTD1 to d-tyrosine and to give this strain the phenotype of DBY2057(pYES2-DTD1). Moreover, because they each overexpress the DTD1 gene, the two pYES2-DTD1 carrying strains grew slightly better than DBY2057(pYES2) in the presence ofd-tyrosine. On minimal medium agar plates supplemented with glucose, the sensitivity to d-tyrosine of strain DBY2057ΔDTD1 still responded to the transformation with plasmid pYES2-DTD1. However, as clearly shown on the plates containing 30 or 100 μmd-tyrosine (Fig. 3), the strain DBY2057ΔDTD1 transformed by pYES2-DTD1 remained slightly more sensitive to d-tyrosine than the control DTD1strain transformed by either pYES2-DTD1 or pYES2 plasmid. This behavior reflects the specific repression of the cloned DTD1 gene on the plasmid under glucose conditions. Indeed, the intracellular level of d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity derived from plasmid pYES2-DTD1 in the context of strain DBY2057ΔDTD1 was 2-fold smaller than that arising from the chromosome in the wild-type strain DBY2057 carrying control plasmid pYES2 (Table II). Altogether, the above results suggested that theDTD1 gene product can protect S. cerevisiaeagainst the toxicity of externally added d-tyrosine through an intracellular hydrolysis of d-Tyr-tRNATyr. Such a conclusion implies that misacylation of tRNATyr byd-tyrosine can occur in vivo. Because E. coli and B. subtilis tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases acceptd-tyrosine as a substrate (18.Calendar R. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19.Calendar R. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 20.Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we asked for whetherS. cerevisiae tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase also can produced-Tyr-tRNATyr. In a first set of experiments, native tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was partially purified from a S. cerevisiae crude extract by chromatography on a Q-Sepharose column. Using crude brewer's yeast tRNA and radioactived-tyrosine (3.5 μm) as substrates, the obtained tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase sample could be shown to produced-tyrosylated tRNA at an initial rate of 4 units/mg of total protein in the assay. With 3.5 μml-tyrosine, under the same experimental conditions, the rate of tRNATyr aminoacylation was 680 units/mg. In the second set of experiments, homogeneous His6-tagged tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase of S. cerevisiae was used for aminoacylation assays. With 1 μmd-tyrosine, the initial rate of tRNA aminoacylation was equal to 0.9 × 10−3 s−1. Under the same reaction conditions, the enzyme aminoacylated tRNA with 1 μml-tyrosine at the rate of 0.13 s−1. Therefore, the ratio of initial rates with l-tyrosine ord-tyrosine measured with tagged protein was comparable to that determined with partially purified native tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (ratio values of 145 and 170, respectively). Finally, the initial rate of d-Tyr-tRNATyr formation by tagged tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase in the presence of 1 μmd-[3H]tyrosine was reduced by at least 98% upon addition of 5 μm nonradioactivel-tyrosine to the incubation mixture. Synthesis of d-Tyr-tRNATyr by tagged tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase could be further established by aminoacylation assays conducted in the presence of pure E. coli d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase (20.Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase concentration in the assay (270 nm) was adjusted so that within 10 min, 150 nm of d-tyrosylated tRNA was produced in the absence of deacylase. When 150 nmdeacylase was present, the production of d-Tyr-tRNA was reduced by more than 96%. In parallel experiments, we verified that the presence of d-Tyr-tRNA deacylase did not affect the formation of l-Tyr-tRNATyr. All these results reinforce our initial views that mischarging of d-tyrosine onto tRNATyr by S. cerevisiae tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is at the origin of at least a part of the toxicity of thisd-amino acid. The present study shows that, like E. coli, S. cerevisiae harbors a gene encoding a protein withd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase activity. This gene confers protection to the cell against one harmful effect ofd-tyrosine. Consequently, the phylogenetic distribution of the dtd/DTD1 homologs may be considered again. When the available complete genome sequences are examined, it is striking to note that, systematically, the organisms that are auxotrophic for l-tyrosine (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Rickettsia prowazekii, Borrelia burgdorferi, Treponema pallidum, Chlamydia trachomatis, andChlamydia pneumoniae) lack a dtd/DTD1-like gene. Consequently, it is tempting to conclude that those cells, which do not synthesize l-tyrosine, do not produced-tyrosine and therefore do not need a deacylase activity. This idea implies that d-tyrosine can be made as a side product of the anabolic pathways for l-tyrosine synthesis. Whatever the considered organism, the biosynthesis ofl-tyrosine from prephenate always involves two steps: a decarboxylation-dehydrogenation step and a transamination step (35.Stenmark S.L. Pierson D.L. Jensen R.A. Nature. 1974; 247: 290-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 36.Jensen R.A. Pierson D.L. Nature. 1975; 254: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 37.Jensen R. Fischer R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the time sequence of these two steps depends on the cell. In organisms like E. coli or B. subtilis, the decarboxylation-dehydrogenation of prephenate takes place first. It produces 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The last step ofl-tyrosine biosynthesis is the addition of an amino group to the future Cα atom of l-tyrosine (37.Jensen R. Fischer R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). One may assume that, upon this transformation, d-tyrosine can appear as a side product and requiresd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase to circumvent the ensuing toxicity. In other organisms such as most cyanobacteria, the transamination of prephenate is made first leading to l-arogenate. In a second step, l-arogenate is transformed intol-tyrosine by arogenate dehydrogenase (35.Stenmark S.L. Pierson D.L. Jensen R.A. Nature. 1974; 247: 290-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 38.Hall G. Flick M. Gherna R. Jensen R. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 65-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, the production of d-tyrosine would be avoided because the arogenate dehydrogenase only works with l-arogenate. Interestingly, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, which possesses al-tyrosine pathway via l-arogenate, does not show any dtd/DTD1-like gene. From the genome data only, it is difficult, however, to predict which pathway is used for the biosynthesis of l-tyrosine. The reason is that the enzymes of the two pathways can share sequence homologies. For instance, the Synechocystis arogenate dehydrogenase shows 28% amino acid sequence identity with the prephenate dehydrogenase of B. subtilis. In addition, in organisms like Serratia, Erwinia, Aeromonas, andPseudomonas (37.Jensen R. Fischer R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 39.Xia T. Jensen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20033-20036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the two pathways can co-exist. Moreover, some biochemical data do not support the occurrence of a strict correlation between the presence of a dtd/DTD1homolog and the production of l-tyrosine via the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate pathway. For instance, prephenate dehydrogenase activity could not be detected in extracts of Streptomyces griseus (40.Lingens F. Keller E. Naturwissenschaften. 1983; 70: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or Corynebacterium glutamicum (41.Fazel A. Jensen R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 138: 805-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the two bacteria exhibit a dtd/DTD1-like gene. At least in such cases, sources of cellular d-tyrosine distinct from the l-tyrosine synthesis pathways have to be searched for. At this stage, it is worth mentioning the finding ofdl-dityrosine in the S. cerevisiae ascospore wall (42.Briza P. Winkler G. Kalchhauser H. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4288-4294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Briza P. Ellinger A. Winkler G. Breitenbach M. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The catabolic turnover of this dipeptide is likely to generate free d-tyrosine. The biosynthetic routes leading to dl-dityrosine-containing macromolecules have not yet been established. Epimerization of specific positions in the macromolecule or the direct incorporation of d-tyrosine have been envisaged (43.Briza P. Ellinger A. Winkler G. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15118-15123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such an incorporation ofd-tyrosine would definitely support the idea of an active metabolic pool of this amino acid in the yeast cell. We thank Dr. F. Kepes for the generous gift of S. cerevisiae strain DBY2057 and Dr. G. Peyroche for helpful advice on the use of plasmid pFA6-kanMX4."
https://openalex.org/W2038867589,"Catabolism of AMP during ATP breakdown produces adenosine, which restores energy balance. Catabolism of IMP may be a key step regulating purine nucleotide pools. Two, cloned cytosolic 5′-nucleotidases (cN-I and cN-II) have been implicated in AMP and IMP breakdown. To evaluate their roles directly, we expressed recombinant pigeon cN-I or human cN-II at similar activities in COS-7 or H9c2 cells. During rapid (more than 90% in 10 min) or slower (30–40% in 10 min) ATP catabolism, cN-I-transfected COS-7 and H9c2 cells produced significantly more adenosine than cN-II-transfected cells, which were similar to control-transfected cells. Inosine and hypoxanthine concentrations increased only during slower ATP catabolism. In COS-7 cells, 5′-nucleotidase activity was not rate-limiting for inosine and hypoxanthine production, which was therefore unaffected by cN-II- and actually reduced by cN-I- overexpression. In H9c2 cells, in which 5′-nucleotidase activity was rate-limiting, only cN-II overexpression accelerated inosine and hypoxanthine formation. Guanosine formation from GMP was also increased by cN-II. Our results imply distinct roles for cN-I and cN-II. Under the conditions tested in these cells, only cN-I plays a significant role in AMP breakdown to adenosine, whereas only cN-II breaks down IMP to inosine and GMP to guanosine.

Formation of adenosine from AMP represents an important regulatory mechanism in cellular ATP homeostasis. In the heart, for example, adenosine causes coronary vasodilatation (1.Berne R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1964; 44: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), inhibits sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction (2.Jenkins J.R. Belardinelli L. Circ. Res. 1988; 63: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), antagonises production (3.Khan M.T. Malik K.U. J. Pharmac. 1980; 68: 551-561Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and action of catecholamines (4.Schrader J. Baumann G. Gerlach E. Pflügers Arch. 1977; 372: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), causes pain (5.Lagerqvist B. Sylven C. Beermann B. Helmius G. Waldenstrom A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1990; 24: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and contributes to ischemic preconditioning (6.Mullane K. Bullough D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We proposed that adenosine acts as a “retaliatory metabolite,” being formed when there is an excess of ATP breakdown over its formation and mediating the spectrum of actions designed to restore energy balance (7.Newby A.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 42-44Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 8.Newby A.C. Worku Y. Meghji P. Nakazawa M. Skladanowski A.C. News Physiol. Sci. 1990; 5: 67-70Google Scholar). The pathways of ATP catabolism and adenosine formation are described in Fig. 1. The nature of the enzyme responsible for cytosolic AMP catabolism to adenosine has been the subject of much controversy. Two forms of cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase (cN-I and cN-II)1 (EC 3.1.3.5) have been implicated. The cN-I was very recently cloned and shown to catalyze adenosine formation during ATP breakdown (9.Sala-Newby G.B. Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17789-17793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The role of cN-II is less clear. Levels of expression of cN-II are usually higher in cultured cells compared with the corresponding tissue. It has therefore been suggested that cN-II is particularly important in cells with high DNA synthesis or turnover (10.Itoh R. Yamada K. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The cN-II was cloned from chicken, human, and ox (11.Oka J. Matsumoto A. Husokawa Y. Inoue S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12.Allegrini S. Pesi R. Tozzi M.G. Fiol C.J. Johnson R.B. Eriksson S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and was later shown to have activityin vitro (12.Allegrini S. Pesi R. Tozzi M.G. Fiol C.J. Johnson R.B. Eriksson S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13.Spychala J. Chen V. Oka J. Mitchell B.S. FASEB J. 1996; 10 (abstr.): 601Google Scholar). Stable cell lines overexpressing cN-II were recently shown to have slightly reduced total nucleoside triphosphate pools (14.Rampazzo C. Gazziola C. Ferraro P. Gallinaro L. Johansson M. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the function of cN-II in cells undergoing ATP breakdown has remained untested. From enzyme kinetic data, the cN-I displays a preference for AMP over IMP and is stimulated by ADP but not ATP (15.Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16.Yamazaki Y. Truong V.L. Lowenstein J.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), implying that it is active against AMP during ATP catabolism. Furthermore, its pH regulation (17.Gustafson L.A. Kroll K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 43: H529-H538Google Scholar) and studies with selective inhibitors (18.Garvey E.P. Prus K.L. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) have implicated cN-I in adenosine formation in the heart, adding weight to the cloning and expression data (9.Sala-Newby G.B. Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17789-17793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The cN-II displays selectivity for IMP and GMP over AMP, is stimulated by both ATP and ADP, and is inhibited by inorganic phosphate (19.Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). These data suggest a selective role for cN-II in catabolism of IMP and cast doubt on whether it is active during ATP catabolism. On the other hand, theK m for AMP of cN-II measured in the presence of optimal activator, ATP, is similar to that of cN-I (approximately 5 mm) (19.Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), and studies with selective inhibitors have also implicated cN-II in adenosine formation (20.Skladanowski A.C. Sala G.B. Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) during ATP breakdown. The availability of cDNA clones for cN-I and cN-II has allowed us for the first time to compare their ability to catalyze AMP and IMP degradation directly in the same cell types. The overexpression strategy employed here allowed us to increase the activity of cN-I or cN-II selectively, without altering the levels of the other enzymes in the pathway. We chose to study two different cell types, COS-7 and H9c2 cells. COS-7 cells were chosen because of their ease of transfection and because flux through AMP deaminase was low compared with cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase (see Fig. 1). Hence, IMP did not accumulate, and this was an ideal cell line in which to compare the activity of cN-I and cN-II in adenosine formation. In order to compare the effect of cN-I and cN-II overexpression on IMP degradation, it was necessary to use a cell line in which AMP deaminase was greater than cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase activity and hence IMP accumulated. Skeletal muscle contains the highest concentration of AMP deaminase (21.Fishbein W.N. Sabina R.L. Ogasawara N. Holmes E.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Sports Med. 1990; 11: S37-S46Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the H9c2 cell line, a subclone derived from embryonic rat heart that has morphological and biochemical characteristics of embryonic cardiac and skeletal myocytes (23.Hescheler J. Meyer R. Plant S. Krautwurst D. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 24.Sipido K.R. Marban E. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1487-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cells transfected to express β-galactosidase (β-gal) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) were used as controls. The full-length cDNA clone coding for pigeon cN-I has already been described (9.Sala-Newby G.B. Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17789-17793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The human cN-II cDNA clone was obtained by polymerase chain reaction from total placental cDNA using oligonucleotide primers designed from the published sequence (11.Oka J. Matsumoto A. Husokawa Y. Inoue S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and a proofreading thermostable DNA polymerase (BIO-X-ACT, Bioline, London, United Kingdom). The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the TA cloning vector pTargeT (Promega, Southampton, United Kingdom). Several clones were sequenced in both directions using the dideoxy chain termination method and an ABI (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Division) automated sequencer. The clone used for these studies contained an open reading frame coding for a 561-amino acid, 65-kDa protein with a single difference from the published sequence, D265G, but use of this clone did not affect any kinetic parameter measured (see below). Cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells were transfected according to the manufacturer's instructions in 6-well plates with 10 μl of LipofectAMINE-PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.) per well. COS-7 cells (105) had 0.2 μg of cN-I plasmid plus 0.8 μg of pSV-β-gal (Promega) control plasmid, or 0.8 μg of cN-II plasmid plus 0.2 μg of pSV-β-gal or plus 1 μg of pSV-β-gal. H9c2 cells (ATCC, CRL-1446) (1.5 × 105) had 0.8 μg of cN-I plasmid plus 0.2 μg of pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH, Basingstoke, United Kingdom) control plasmid, or 0.8 μg of cN-II plasmid plus 0.2 μg of pEGFP-N1 or plus 1 μg of pEGFP-N1. Cells were used 48 h after transfection. Cells were briefly washed twice in 0.15 m NaCl, transferred to 0.8 ml of KRH (containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mmKCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) and preincubated for 15 min with 10 μm erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4) (25.Newby A.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 2611-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated for up to 10 min in fresh medium containing EHNA and 50 μm5′-amino-5′-deoxyadenosine to inhibit adenosine kinase (EC 2.7.1.20) (25.Newby A.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 2611-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Metabolic inhibition was triggered by inhibition of glycolysis with 5 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose (DOG) or with 10 mm DOG plus the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP (1 μm). FCCP did not inhibit the activity of AMP deaminase, cN-I, or cN-II measured in homogenates. Allopurinol (100 μm) was added to inhibit xanthine oxidase. Cell incubations were terminated, and metabolite and protein concentrations were determined as described below. The cell viability was assessed by measurement of lactate dehydrogenase in cell supernatants at the end of the incubations (Roche Molecular Biochemicals cytotoxicity test) or by fluorescence microscopy after addition of propidium iodide (1 μg/ml). Nonviable cells were expressed as a percentage of the total lactate dehydrogenase present in parallel wells extracted in KRH containing 0.1% Triton X-100 or total cell counts, respectively. Expression of β-gal was measured histochemically as described previously (26.Baker A.H. Wilkinson G.W.G. Hembry R.M. Murphy G. Newby A.C. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 383-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), as a measure of transfection efficiency. Addition of 0.75 volumes of 1.6 mHClO4 was used to terminate reactions followed by neutralization of supernatants with 0.125 volumes of 3 mK3PO4. Nucleosides and nucleotides were measured by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (27.Smolenski R.T. Lachno D.R. Ledingham S.J.M. Yacoub M.H. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 527: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), but performed at pH 6.7 and using a modified gradient of B (15% acetonitrile in Buffer A containing 150 mm KCl and 150 mmKH2PO4) changed linearly as follows: 0 min, 0% B; 0.1 min, 3% B; 3 min, 9% B; 7.5 min, 100% B; 8.5 min, 0% solution B for 3.5 min. Protein concentrations were measured in the HClO4 pellets resuspended in 1 m NaOH using a micro-BCA assay (Pierce). To measure cN-I activity, control- and cN-I-transfected cells were extracted with a buffer containing 40 mmN-dimethylglutarate, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 200 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 6.9. Aliquots of extract were incubated for 0 and 5 min at 37 °C with an equal volume of the substrate mix to yield final concentrations of 2 μm pentostatin, 10 μm5′-deoxy-5′-aminoadenosine, 50 μm α, β-methylene-ADP, and 1 mm free MgCl2 with 4.8 mmATP, 2.8 mm ADP, 0.66 mm AMP or 4.8 mm ATP, 4.9 mm ADP, 2 mm AMP (28.Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Hanes-Woolf equation was used to linearize the data, and the slope allowed the calculation of V max. To measure cN-II activity, cells were extracted with a buffer containing 10 mm TES, 120 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 6.5. Aliquots of cell extract were incubated for 0 and 5 min at 37 °C with an equal volume of the substrate mix to yield final concentrations of 70 mm Na-β-glycerophosphate (pH 6.5), 35 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 2 mm IMP to measure V max or a with a range of IMP concentrations for K m determinations. The effect of phosphate (at 1 mm ATP), ATP, and FCCP were investigated at 0.25 mm IMP, and the substrate preference was investigated at 2 mm AMP or GMP. Adenosine and inosine concentrations were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography and protein concentration by BCA assay, as described above. Each experiment consisted of at least duplicate observations. Averages for at least three independent experiments are expressed as mean ± S.E. When only two experiments were carried out, the range is given. Comparisons are made by Student's t test using paired data if available. As described previously (9.Sala-Newby G.B. Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17789-17793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the pigeon heart cN-I expressed in COS-7 cells had characteristics similar to the enzyme purified from pigeon, rat, rabbit, and human hearts. It had a preference for AMP over IMP, aK m for AMP of approximately 3 mm. Human recombinant cN-II expressed in COS-7 cells had a K mvalue measured in the presence of a maximum activating concentration of 5 mm ATP of 0.2 and 0.06 mm IMP. It preferred GMP to IMP to AMP (1.33:1:0.33 or 1.33:1:0.27 in two separate experiments). Removal of ATP from the assay reduced activity by 68 and 64%, whereas addition of 5 mm phosphate inhibited activity in the presence of 1 mm ATP by 98 and 99%. All of these properties are consistent with those of the purified enzymes from humans and other species (19.Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 29.Spychala J. Madrid-Marina V. Fox I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18759-18765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We diluted the cN-I and cN-II plasmids with control pSVβ-gal plasmid in order to achieve similar levels of 5′-nucleotidase activity in transfected cells (TableI). The specific activity of the enzymes was compared with that in control cells that had been transfected to express β-gal alone. Homogenate cN-I activity was increased 7-fold, and cN-II activity was increased 10-fold, respectively (Table I). Between 24 and 30% of the cells were shown to express β-gal by histochemical staining.Table IActivity of 5′ nucleotidasse in COS-7 and H9c2 cellsCell lineTransfectioncN-I activitycN-II activityCOS-7 (n = 5)β-gal0.026 ± 0.0150.021 ± 0.006cN-I0.18 ± 0.06NDcN-IIND0.20 ± 0.07H9c2 (n = 3)GFP0.012 ± 0.0040.016 ± 0.001cN-I0.042 ± 0.006NDcN-IIND0.033 ± 0.007Cells transfected 48 hours previously were solubilized and total extracts were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” cN-I and cN-II activity are expressed (mean ± SE) as μmol · min−1 · mg protein−1.

ND, not determined. The initial concentration of ATP was 146 ± 19, 139 ± 21, and 144 ± 24 nmol·mg of protein−1 for β-gal-, cN-II-, and cN-I-transfected cells, respectively, and remained unchanged during incubations without metabolic poisons for up 10 min (results not shown). We measured the breakdown of ATP to ADP, AMP, and its further metabolites adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine (Fig.1). Incubation of the cells with inhibitors of adenosine deaminase and adenosine kinase allowed the measurement of the rates of adenosine formation without further metabolism back to AMP or to inosine and hypoxanthine. To control for the effectiveness of inhibition, we measured metabolism of 2 μm exogenous adenosine. With inhibitors present, 105 ± 6% was recovered after a 10 min incubation at 37 °C (n = 3). In the experiments with metabolic inhibitors (see below), inosine and hypoxanthine did not arise by deamination of adenosine but from metabolism of AMP to IMP by AMP deaminase followed by catabolism of IMP (Fig. 1). COS-7 cells did not contain detectable xanthine oxidase (results not shown), and hence, allopurinol was not used to inhibit further metabolism of hypoxanthine to uric acid. We investigated ATP breakdown and adenosine formation under two conditions of metabolic inhibition. The amount of lactate dehydrogenase present in the supernatants remained unaffected and below 5% under all conditions tested. Treatment of control and cN-II-expressing COS-7 cells with 10 mm DOG + 1 μm FCCP for 10 min caused 91 ± 1 and 91 ± 1% falls in the ATP concentration after 10 min, respectively (Fig.2 a). After 10 min, 74 ± 1 and 74 ± 1%, respectively, of the fall in ATP concentration was accounted for by increased AMP and 8.6 ± 1.7 and 9.3 ± 2.1% by adenosine. Although cN-I-transfected cells showed a similar 91 ± 2% fall in ATP concentration (Fig. 2 a), only 48 ± 2% was accounted for by increased AMP (p < 0.01 versus β-gal or cN-II), whereas 31 ± 3% was accounted for by increased adenosine (p < 0.02versus β-gal or cN-II). Measurements of absolute adenosine concentration (Fig. 3 a) show that adenosine accumulation in cN-I-transfected cells was nonlinear but significantly greater than in β-gal- or cN-II-transfected cells at 5 and 10 min. There was no difference in adenosine accumulation between β-gal- and cN-II-transfected cells (Fig. 3 a). The concentration of IMP (the preferred substrate of cN-II) remained below 0.25 nmol·mg of protein−1 under all conditions of incubation and did not accumulate during ATP breakdown (Fig.2 a). This demonstrates that the activity of adenosine deaminase was low under these conditions. Indeed inosine and hypoxanthine, the ultimate products of AMP deamination (Fig. 1), did not accumulate either under these conditions (Fig. 3 b). These data indicate that even when the competing substrate, IMP, remained at very low concentrations, only cN-I and not cN-II overexpression increased adenosine production.Figure 3Nucleoside and hypoxanthine concentrations in COS-7 cells. The concentrations of adenosine (a andc) and inosine plus hypoxanthine (b andd) generated by cells treated (open symbols) with 10 mm DOG plus 1 μm FCCP (a andb) or 5 mm DOG (c and d) compared with untreated controls (closed symbols). *,p < 0.05 versus cN-II or β-gal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because cN-II is activated by ATP, we also conducted experiments under conditions of slower ATP decline. Incubation of β-gal-and cN-II-transfected COS-7 cells for 10 min in the presence of 5 mm DOG alone caused a 35 ± 4 and 34 ± 2% fall in the ATP concentration, respectively (Fig. 2 b). Of this, 8.4 ± 3.3 and 11 ± 6% accumulated as AMP, and 5.3 ± 2.0 and 5.9 ± 1.7% accumulated as adenosine, respectively (Fig.2 b). Cells overexpressing cN-I also lost 35 ± 7% of their ATP and 8.3 ± 5.5% was accounted for by AMP (Fig.2 b). Adenosine accumulation accounted for 24 ± 6.3% of ATP breakdown, significantly more (p < 0.04) than in β-gal- or cN-II-transfected cells (Figs. 2 b and3 c). Hence, even under these conditions, only cN-I and not cN-II increased adenosine formation (Fig. 3 c). AMP deaminase was active under these conditions, and AMP breakdown proceeded mainly to inosine and hypoxanthine (Figs. 2 b and3 d). Inosine and hypoxanthine accumulated to a similar extent in β-gal- and cN-II-transfected cells (Fig. 3 d). As expected, cN-I overexpression caused a converse decrease in the accumulation of inosine and hypoxanthine because catabolism was diverted to adenosine (Figs. 2 b and 3 d). The concentration of IMP remained below 0.4 nmol·mg of protein−1 in all transfected cells under these conditions. Hence, even under these conditions, the activity of AMP deaminase was rate-limiting, and the endogenous activity of 5′-nucleotidase in all cells was therefore sufficient for production of inosine, and hypoxanthine. It was therefore impossible to measure the effect of cN-I or cN-II on catabolism of IMP in COS-7 cells. In order to investigate the effect of cN-I or cN-II overexpression on IMP breakdown, it was necessary to find a cell line in which AMP deaminase was not rate-limiting. Skeletal muscle contains the highest concentration of AMP deaminase (21.Fishbein W.N. Sabina R.L. Ogasawara N. Holmes E.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We therefore chose to reexamine the effect of cN-I and cN-II overexpression in H9c2 cells, which have a mixed heart/skeletal muscle phenotype. H9c2 cells were cotransfected with a plasmid coding for enhanced GFP, together with one for cN-I or cN-II, so as to express similar activities of 5′-nucleotidase (Table I) or with GFP alone, as control. The proportion of cells transfected, as determined by GFP fluorescence, was 20–25%. Activities of cN-I and cN-II were some 5–6-fold lower than in COS-7 cells (Table I). ATP concentrations were similar in GFP-, cN-I-, and cN-II-transfected cells (103 ± 4, 94 ± 4, and 101 ± 9 nmol·mg of protein−1, respectively) in the absence of metabolic inhibitors. ATP breakdown was induced either by DOG + FCCP or by DOG alone, and the same metabolites were measured as for COS-7 cells. The concentration of guanosine was also measured, as it is a potential product of 5′-nucleotidase activity. Cell viability by release of lactate dehydrogenase and propidium iodide staining was above 95% under all conditions used. The purine metabolite concentrations are summarized in Fig.4 and TableII. The major difference between H9c2 and COS-7 cells was that IMP clearly accumulated during ATP breakdown, especially with DOG plus FCCP, indicating that AMP deaminase activity was not rate-limiting (Fig. 4). ATP breakdown was similar in GFP-, cN-I-, and cN-II-transfected cells. Adenosine accumulation occurred in cN-I-overexpressing cells even in the absence of metabolic poisons (Table II), as previously shown in COS-7 cells (9.Sala-Newby G.B. Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17789-17793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Under both conditions of ATP breakdown, cN-I overexpression significantly accelerated adenosine formation, as demonstrated above for COS-7 cells. However, cN-II overexpression did not increase adenosine formation under either condition of ATP breakdown (Table II). Overexpression of cN-II increased inosine and hypoxanthine accumulation in the presence of 5 mm DOG (Table II). The concentration of guanosine was also significantly increased (Table II). Both measures clearly indicate that cN-II is active under these conditions and is capable of IMP and GMP catabolism. By contrast, overexpression of cN-I did not increase inosine, hypoxanthine, or guanosine concentrations relative to GFP-transfected cells, demonstrating that it does not contribute to the metabolism of IMP under these conditions.Table IIMetabolite concentrations in transiently transfected H9c2 cellsTreatmentOverexpressors ofInosineHypoxanthineGuanosineAdenosineNoneGFP0.2 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.1ND2.9 ± 0.7cN-I1.3 ± 0.91.2 ± 0.9ND6.2 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 versus GFP- or cN-II-transfected cells subjected to the same treatment.cN-II0.5 ± 0.00.7 ± 0.4ND2.6 ± 1.310 mm DOG plus 1 μm FCCPGFP2.2 ± 1.21.9 ± 0.80.7 ± 0.710.5 ± 0.9cN-I3.3 ± 1.42.6 ± 1.70.9 ± 0.126.1 ± 3.5ap < 0.05 versus GFP- or cN-II-transfected cells subjected to the same treatment.cN-II4.3 ± 1.21.9 ± 0.80.2 ± 0.010.3 ± 2.25 mm DOGGFP12.8 ± 2.93.2 ± 0.23.0 ± 1.65.5 ± 0.5cN-I13.7 ± 0.23.1 ± 0.83.3 ± 0.413.1 ± 0.6ap < 0.05 versus GFP- or cN-II-transfected cells subjected to the same treatment.cN-II25.7 ± 1.3bp < 0.05 versus GFP- or cN-I-transfected cells subjected to the same treatment.7.1 ± 1.4bp < 0.05 versus GFP- or cN-I-transfected cells subjected to the same treatment.7.0 ± 1.2bp < 0.05 versus GFP- or cN-I-transfected cells subjected to the same treatment.4.9 ± 1.0Transfected H9c2 cells were incubated in the presence of adenosine deaminase and adenosine kinase inhibitors.

Overexpression of cN-II did not increase inosine, hypoxanthine, or guanosine concentrations during severe ATP depletion with DOG plus FCCP, which, together with the greater accumulation of IMP (Fig. 4), indicates that cN-II is inactive under these conditions. Overexpression of cN-I was also without effect on IMP and GMP metabolites under these conditions. Kinetic, molecular, and inhibitor studies have previously implicated cN-I in adenosine formation (9.Sala-Newby G.B. Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17789-17793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15.Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. Biochem.

Prus K.L. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, the role of cN-II in adenosine formation has remained unclear. Ours is the first study to compare directly the roles of cN-I and cN-II in AMP catabolism to adenosine in the same cell type during ATP breakdown. The major conclusion is that only cN-I and not cN-II catalyzes significant formation of adenosine under rapid or more progressive conditions of ATP depletion. This conclusion applied equally to two cell types of widely different origin, namely COS-7 or H9c2 cells. However, the lack of AMP catalysis through cN-II is all the more remarkable in COS-7 cells, given that IMP concentrations remained very low, owing to the relatively low activity of AMP deaminase, even when ATP levels were less severely depleted. Hence competition between IMP and AMP for metabolism by cN-II could not explain its inability to produce adenosine. Our studies could not clearly establish whether cN-I or cN-II is capable of IMP catabolism in COS-7 cells, because AMP deaminase was rate-limiting under all the conditions investigated. We therefore addressed this issue in H9c2 cells, in which IMP was shown to accumulate during ATP breakdown and hence 5′-nucleotidase activity rather than AMP deaminase was rate-limiting for the pathway. In H9c2 cells, it was clear that cN-II could contribute to IMP catabolism under conditions of progressive ATP breakdown but not when ATP pools were rapidly depleted. These observations are consistent with previousin vitro and in vivo data (30.Itoh R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 659: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31.Worku Y. Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) showing that cN-II activity is biphasically related to energy charge. Activity of cN-II is increased during moderate falls in energy charge but strongly inhibited by profound falls. The failure of cN-I to catalyze IMP breakdown is consistent with its preference for AMP in vitro. The kinetic properties of the enzymes from pigeon, rabbit, rat, and human are remarkably similar (15.Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16.Yamazaki Y. Truong V.L. Lowenstein J.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 32.Skladanowski A.C. Smolenski R.T. Tavernier M. de Jong J.W. Yacoub M.H. Seymour A.M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1493-H1500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore unlikely that our results arise from the use of a pigeon enzyme in mammalian cells. Putative human (GenBankTM accession numberAA446194) and mouse (GenBankTM accession number AI429147) homologues exist for pigeon cN-I and show considerable protein sequence homology. Our present results further support a physiological role for cN-I in adenosine formation, which opens up the possibility of varying adenosine formation rates by manipulating the enzyme activity. Increasing cN-I activity would be expected to promote a variety of cytoprotective actions. In contrast to cN-I, the role of cN-II appears to be restricted to IMP rather than AMP catabolism. IMP can arise by action of AMP deaminase on AMP, during ATP breakdown, but is also the product of de novo purine synthesis, under conditions of abundant ATP. Activity of cN-II may therefore be a key step controlling the balance of purine accumulation within cells and hence the upper limit of the purine nucleotide pool (33.Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. Imai S. Nakazawa M. Role of Adenosine and Adenine Nucleotides in the Biological System. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1991: 289-300Google Scholar). Interestingly, work from Bianchi and co-workers (14.Rampazzo C. Gazziola C. Ferraro P. Gallinaro L. Johansson M. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) shows that stable cell lines overexpressing cN-II have somewhat lower total ATP and other purine trinucleotide levels. It would be interesting, in future studies, to examine the responses of these cell lines to mild and severe metabolic stresses. In the present experiments, we did not observe any effects of cN-I or cN-II overexpression on baseline ATP levels in COS-7 or H9c2. However, transient transfection occurred in only 20–30% of cells, which may confound these measurements. Overexpression of cN-I at 10-fold higher levels than used here did produce a decrease in baseline ATP concentration in COS-7 cells (9.Sala-Newby G.B. Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17789-17793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our present results clearly demonstrate that cN-I and cN-II play distinct roles in AMP and IMP catabolism, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2009106256,"SWI-SNF is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex required for expression of a number of yeast genes. Previous studies have suggested that SWI-SNF action may remove or rearrange the histone H2A-H2B dimers or induce a novel alteration in the histone octamer. Here, we have directly tested these and other models by quantifying the remodeling activity of SWI-SNF on arrays of (H3-H4)2 tetramers, on nucleosomal arrays reconstituted with disulfide-linked histone H3, and on arrays reconstituted with histone H3 derivatives site-specifically modified at residue 110 with the fluorescent probe acetylethylenediamine-(1,5)-naphthol sulfonate. We find that SWI-SNF can remodel (H3-H4)2 tetramers, although tetramers are poor substrates for SWI-SNF remodeling compared with nucleosomal arrays. SWI-SNF can also remodel nucleosomal arrays that harbor disulfide-linked (H3-H4)2 tetramers, indicating that SWI-SNF action does not involve an obligatory disruption of the tetramer. Finally, we find that although the fluorescence emission intensity of acetylethylenediamine-(1,5)-naphthol sulfonate-modified histone H3 is sensitive to octamer structure, SWI-SNF action does not alter fluorescence emission intensity. These data suggest that perturbation of the histone octamer is not a requirement or a consequence of ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling by SWI-SNF. SWI-SNF is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex required for expression of a number of yeast genes. Previous studies have suggested that SWI-SNF action may remove or rearrange the histone H2A-H2B dimers or induce a novel alteration in the histone octamer. Here, we have directly tested these and other models by quantifying the remodeling activity of SWI-SNF on arrays of (H3-H4)2 tetramers, on nucleosomal arrays reconstituted with disulfide-linked histone H3, and on arrays reconstituted with histone H3 derivatives site-specifically modified at residue 110 with the fluorescent probe acetylethylenediamine-(1,5)-naphthol sulfonate. We find that SWI-SNF can remodel (H3-H4)2 tetramers, although tetramers are poor substrates for SWI-SNF remodeling compared with nucleosomal arrays. SWI-SNF can also remodel nucleosomal arrays that harbor disulfide-linked (H3-H4)2 tetramers, indicating that SWI-SNF action does not involve an obligatory disruption of the tetramer. Finally, we find that although the fluorescence emission intensity of acetylethylenediamine-(1,5)-naphthol sulfonate-modified histone H3 is sensitive to octamer structure, SWI-SNF action does not alter fluorescence emission intensity. These data suggest that perturbation of the histone octamer is not a requirement or a consequence of ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling by SWI-SNF. base pair(s) acetylethylenediamine-(1,5)-naphthol sulfonate 5-IAEDANS, iodoacetylethylenediamine-(1,5)-naphthol sulfonate The assembly of eukaryotic DNA into folded nucleosomal arrays has drastic consequences for many nuclear processes that require access to the DNA sequence, including RNA transcription, DNA replication, recombination, and repair. The nucleosome, which consists of 147 bp1 of DNA wrapped nearly twice around an octamer of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, can occlude DNA sequences both in vivo and in vitro. The nucleosome is not a static structure but appears to be a dynamic and flexible assembly. For instance, moderate concentrations of NaCl can lead to several distinct changes in nucleosome conformation (1.Dieterich A.E. Axel R. Cantor C.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1978; 42: 199-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Dieterich A.E. Axel R. Cantor C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 587-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3.Yager T.D. van Holde K.E. J.

In addition, nucleosomes isolated from transcriptionally active chromatin appear to be depleted of histone H2A-H2B dimers (discussed in Ref. 5.Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 187-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and contain histone octamers the interiors of which are more accessible to enzymatic and chemical modifications (6.Prior C.P.

Nucleosomes from transcriptionally active chromatin can also be visualized microscopically as extended, largely unfolded structures (9.Bazett-Jones D.P. Mendez E. Czarnota G.J. Ottensmeyer F.P.

Micron. 1997; 28: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These and other studies have led to the view that regulatory factors might antagonize the repressive effects of chromatin by disrupting the structure or conformation of the histone octamer (discussed in Ref.11.Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Two types of highly conserved chromatin remodeling enzymes have been implicated as regulators of the repressive nature of chromatin structure (12.Pollard K.J. Peterson C.L. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13.Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Several members of the SWI2/SNF2 family of DNA-stimulated ATPases use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to disrupt nucleosome structure, which can lead to an enhanced mobility of nucleosomes (14.Hamiche A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Gdula D.A. Wu C. Cell. 1999; 97: 833-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 15.Langst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B.

The second type consists of the nuclear histone acetyltransferases that covalently modify lysine residues within the flexible N-terminal domains of the histone proteins. TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae SWI-SNF complex is the prototype ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex. This widely conserved 2-MDa multisubunit assembly is required for the inducible expression of a number of diversely regulated yeast genes and for the full functioning of many transcriptional activators (reviewed in Refs.17.Winston F. Carlson M. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar and 18.Burns L. Peterson C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). SWI-SNF can be recruited to target genes via direct interactions with gene-specific activators (19.Natarajan K. Jackson B.M.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2369-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and in several cases, SWI-SNF facilitates the binding of activators to nucleosomal sites in vivo (22.Burns L. Peterson C.L.

Cell. 1999; 97: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In vitro, the purified SWI-SNF complex is a DNA-stimulated ATPase that can use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to disrupt histone-DNA interactions. Although the mechanism by which SWI-SNF disrupts nucleosome structure is not known, this “remodeling” reaction leads to an enhanced accessibility of nucleosomal DNA to DNase I (24.Côté J. Quinn J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2514-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (24.Côté J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). More recently, SWI-SNF has been shown to increase DNA accessibility of nucleosomal arrays in a catalytic manner that is dependent on the presence of histone N-terminal domains (27.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28.Logie C. Tse C. Hansen J. Peterson C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2514-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Four different models have been proposed to explain the mechanism by which ATP-dependent remodeling by the SWI-SNF complex increases nucleosomal DNA accessibility. 1) Several studies have suggested that SWI-SNF might remove or rearrange the H2A-H2B dimers (24.Côté J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 30.Hirschhorn J.N. Brown S.A. Clark C.D. Winston F.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8423-8429Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33.Peterson C.L. Tamkun J.W. Trends Biochem.

Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar). 2) SWI-SNF remodeling may induce a novel conformation of the histone octamer (Refs. 35.Lorch Y. Cairns B.R. Zhang M. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 29-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar and 36.Schnitzler G. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar; discussed in Ref. 11.Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar) that might involve conformational changes in the (H3-H4)2 tetramer analogous to the transcription-associated transitions described above. 3) SWI-SNF may use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to translocate along DNA and destabilize histone-DNA interactions (discussed in Ref. 37.Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 88: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This model is similar to the octamer spooling mechanism described by Studitsky et al. (38.Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) for passage of polymerases through nucleosomes. 4) Finally, SWI-SNF might bind directly to nucleosomes and use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to change the path of nucleosomal DNA (25.Côté J. Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4947-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) or to peel DNA off the surface of the histone octamer without changing octamer structure (39.Bazett-Jones D.P. Cote J. Landel C.C. Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this study, we have directly tested whether ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling by the SWI-SNF complex alters the composition or conformation of the histone octamer. We use a nucleosomal array remodeling assay (27.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28.Logie C. Tse C. Hansen J. Peterson C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2514-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to quantify SWI-SNF activity on arrays of histone (H3-H4)2 tetramers and on nucleosomal arrays reconstituted with histone octamers containing internally cross-linked tetramers. In order to monitor more subtle or transient changes in octamer structure, we also measured the effects of SWI-SNF remodeling on the steady state fluorescence of nucleosomal and tetramer arrays harboring a histone H3 derivative site specifically modified at residue 110 with the fluorescent probe acetylethylenediamine-(1,5)-naphthol sulfonate (AEDANS) (1.Dieterich A.E. Axel R. Cantor C.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1978; 42: 199-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Dieterich A.E. Axel R. Cantor C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 587-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 40.Daban J.R. Cantor C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 192-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data are consistent with a model in which substrate recognition by SWI-SNF requires an intact histone octamer, and subsequent ATP-dependent remodeling disrupts histone-DNA contacts without a concomitant loss of histone proteins or perturbation of the histone octamer. Array DNA template was isolated by digestion of plasmid pCL7c with NotI, HindIII, and HhaI (New England Biolabs) followed by FPLC purification on Sephacryl-500 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) essentially as described (27.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 41.Logie C. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Array DNA template was end-labeled as described (27.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 41.Logie C. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Chicken erythrocyte histone octamers were purified from chicken whole blood (Pel-Freez) as described previously (42.Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Tetramers were provided as a kind gift from Jeff Hansen and were purified by stepwise elution from hydroxylapatite columns as described (42.Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Tetramers were dialyzed against Buffer T (1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) prior to array reconstitution. Disulfide-linked histone octamers were generated by first diluting histone octamers 2-fold with Buffer D1 (10m urea, 2 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) followed by dialysis against Buffer D2 (5 m urea, 2m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at 4 °C with constant agitation for 4 days. Histone octamers were then reconstituted by dialysis against Buffer D3 (2 m NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.25 mm EDTA). Histone H3 oxidation efficiency was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of reducing agent (see Fig. 1 B, lane 3). AEDANS-modified histone H3 was generated by first diluting histone octamers 2-fold with Buffer D1, followed by addition of iodoacetylethylenediamine-(1,5)-naphthol sulfonate (1,5-IAEDANS) (Molecular Probes, Inc.) at a molar ratio of 20:1 (1,5-IAEDANS:H3) and incubation for 2 h at room temperature on a nutator (Adams). Reactions were quenched with an excess of β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and dialyzed against Buffer D2 to remove unreacted 1,5-IAEDANS. Samples were then dialyzed against Buffer D3 to reconstitute histone octamers. Labeling specificity was verified by visualization of the corresponding fluorescent histone band upon illumination with long wave ultraviolet light. SWI-SNF complex was purified from yeast strain CY396 or CY743 (sin3Δ) as described (41.Logie C. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The concentration of complex was determined to be approximately 300 nm by comparative Western blot and by ATPase assays (27.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 41.Logie C. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Arrays were reconstituted onto the 208-11 S DNA template (Fig. 1 A) in a Slide-a-lyzer dialysis cassette (Pierce) using the salt dialysis protocol of Hansen and Lohr (43.Hansen J.C. Lohr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5840-5848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Octamer concentrations were determined by A 230 (44.Stein A. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 130: 103-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Array saturation and nucleosome/tetramer positioning was determined by EcoRI orMspI digestions using approximately 20 nm array in remodeling buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol) as described previously (27.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28.Logie C. Tse C. Hansen J. Peterson C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2514-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 41.Logie C. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,42.Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Arrays were digested for 30 min at 37 °C, and the reactions were electrophoresed on 4% native polyacrylamide gels (see Fig.1 C). The gel was briefly soaked in 2 μg/ml ethidium bromide and photographed under ultraviolet illumination. Coupled array remodeling-restriction reactions were performed in a final concentration of 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, and 500 units/ml HincII (New England Biolabs) as described previously (27.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28.Logie C. Tse C. Hansen J. Peterson C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2514-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 41.Logie C. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectroscopic studies were carried out using a PTI QM1/S.E.901/S.E.910Q fluorescence spectrophotometer. Samples were excited at 344 nm (slit width, 2.5 nm), and emission intensities were recorded from 450 to 500 nm (slit width, 4 nm). Samples (80 μl in quartz microcuvettes) contained 4 nm AEDANS-labeled octamer or tetramer array in remodeling buffer (described above) at room temperature. In experiments assessing effects of monovalent salt, emission intensities were recorded initially 0.5 min after adjustment to 50, 75, 150, and 300 mm NaCl and 0.5, 60, 120, 240, 480, and 960 min after subsequent adjustment to 600 mm NaCl. In experiments assessing effects of SWI-SNF, emission intensities were recorded initially at 5 min after addition of a final concentration of 2, 10, or 20 nm purified SWI-SNF and 5, 10, and 60 min after subsequent addition of a 1 mm final concentration of ATP. For samples in which SWI-SNF, ATP, or salt was added to the arrays, data were corrected for a buffer addition control. All data were corrected for dilution. It has been proposed that SWI-SNF increases the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA by depletion or rearrangement of the histone H2A-H2B dimers (Refs. 24.Côté J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L.

Sci. 1995; 20: 143-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In order to investigate whether loss of the dimers is equivalent to the SWI-SNF remodeled state, we used purified chicken erythrocyte histone octamers or (H3-H4)2 tetramers (Fig.1 B, lanes 1 and 4) to reconstitute nucleosomal or tetramer arrays. The DNA template used for these reconstitutions is composed of 11 head-to-tail repeats of a nucleosome positioning sequence from the Lytechinus variegatus 5 S rRNA gene, each of which is flanked byEcoRI restriction sites. Nucleosomes that are reconstituted onto each of these 5 S repeats assume a major translational position that is present in at least 50% of the population (45.Dong F. Hansen J.C. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5724-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 46.Pennings S. Meersseman G. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Minor translational positions also exist and differ from the major frame by multiples of 10 bp. The central repeat of our array template also bears a unique SalI/HincII restriction site close to the dyad axis of symmetry of a nucleosome positioned at the major frame (27.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 47.Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 130-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Array reconstitutions were analyzed for extent of DNA repeat saturation and for correct positioning by restriction enzyme cleavage (Fig. 1 C; see also under “Experimental Procedures”) (27.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar,41.Logie C. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 42.Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). EcoRI digestion of nucleosomal or tetramer arrays releases primarily mononucleosome-sized particles and few of the high molecular weight partial digestion products that would be indicative of alternative positioning or oversaturation (Fig. 1 C). Digestion of nucleosomal or tetramer arrays with MspI (the site of which is located ∼30 bp from the predicted dyad axis of a nucleosome positioned at the major frame) demonstrates that these sites are fully protected by nucleosomal arrays but accessible in tetramer arrays (Fig. 1 C). These data are consistent with the fact that an (H3-H4)2 tetramer assumes the same translational positions as an intact octamer (48.Dong F. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10596-10600Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 49.Hayes J.J. Clark D.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6829-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) but that the tetramer assembles less DNA (34.Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar). We then exploited a sensitive nucleosomal array remodeling assay in which SWI-SNF remodeling activity is coupled to restriction enzyme activity (27.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28.Logie C. Tse C. Hansen J. Peterson C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2514-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Previously we used this assay to determine the kinetic parameters of ATP-dependent nucleosomal array remodeling by the SWI-SNF and RSC (remodels thestructure of chromatin) complexes (27.Logie C.

To quantify the remodeling capacity of SWI-SNF complex, 3 nm of nucleosomal or tetramer array was exposed to 500 units/ml HincII, either in the presence or absence of 3 nm SWI-SNF complex and 1 mm ATP (Fig.2 A). As described previously,HincII digestion of nucleosomal arrays is biphasic (27.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); the first, rapid phase of the reaction represents digestion of arrays harboring HincII sites positioned between nucleosomes, and the second, slow phase represents digestion of the nucleosomalHincII sites. By limiting our analysis to the second phase of HincII digestion, the first order rate ofHincII cleavage yields a quantitative measurement of nucleosomal DNA accessibility (27.Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28.Logie C. Tse C. Hansen J. Peterson C.L.

In the absence of SWI-SNF, the first order rate of HincII cleavage was 1.3 × 10−5 for tetramer arrays and 2.4 × 10−6 for nucleosomal arrays (Fig. 2; see also Table I). The 5-fold higher rate for the tetramer arrays is comparable to the rate observed previously for nucleosomal arrays reconstituted with histones that lack their trypsin-sensitive N-terminal domains (28.Logie C. Tse C. Hansen J. Peterson C.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2514-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and is consistent with nucleosomal DNA being more accessible in the absence of the histone H2A-H2B dimers (31.Spangenberg C.

In the presence of SWI-SNF, the first order rate of HincII cleavage was 6.4 × 10−5 for tetramer arrays and 9.2 × 10−5for nucleosomal arrays (Fig. 2; Table I). The fact that the rate of cleavage of nucleosomal arrays in the presence of SWI-SNF significantly exceeded the rate of cleavage of tetramer arrays in the absence of SWI-SNF (see Table I) indicates that remodeling is not equivalent simply to loss of histone H2A-H2B dimers. The fact that the rate of cleavage of tetramer arrays in the presence of SWI-SNF is 5-fold higher than the rate in the absence of SWI-SNF indicates further that SWI-SNF can remodel tetramer arrays. However, SWI-SNF remodeling of tetramer arrays appears to be quantitatively less efficient than SWI-SNF remodeling of nucleosomal arrays, as the rate of cleavage of tetramer arrays in the presence of SWI-SNF was 30% slower than that of nucleosomal arrays in the presence of SWI-SNF (Fig. 2 C; see also Table I).Table IComparative analysis of array substratesArray substrateK confaKconf is the conformational equilibrium constant and is defined as the ratio of the rate of digestion of substrate array to the rate of digestion of naked DNA/unit of enzyme (47).

https://openalex.org/W1988762815,"The two isoforms of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I; muscle (M)- and liver (L)-type) of the mitochondrial outer membrane have distinct kinetic characteristics with respect to their affinity for one of the substrates (l-carnitine) and the inhibitor malonyl-CoA. Moreover, they differ markedly in their hysteretic behavior with respect to malonyl-CoA and in their response to changes in the in vivo metabolic state. However, the two proteins are 62% identical and have the same overall structure. Using liver mitochondria, we have previously shown that the protein is polytopic within the outer membrane, comprising a 46-residue cytosolic N-terminal sequence, two transmembrane segments (TM1 and TM2) separated by a 27-residue loop, and a large catalytic domain (also cytosolic) (Fraser, F., Corstorphine, C. G., and Zammit, V. A. (1997)Biochem. J. 323, 711–718). We have now conducted a systematic study on six chimeric proteins constructed from combinations of three linear segments of rat L- and M-CPT I and on the two parental proteins to elucidate the effects of altered intramolecular interactions on the kinetics of CPT activity. The three segments were (i) the cytosolic N-terminal domain plus TM1, (ii) the loop plus TM2, and (iii) the cytosolic catalytic C-terminal domain. The kinetic properties of the chimeric proteins expressed in Pichia pastoris were studied. We found that alterations in the combinations of the N-terminal plus TM1 and C-terminal domains as well as in the N terminus plus TM1/TM2 pairings resulted in changes in theK m values for carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA and the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA of the L-type catalytic domain. The changes in affinity for malonyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA occurred independently of changes in the affinity for carnitine. The kinetic characteristics of the M-type catalytic domain and, in particular, its malonyl-CoA sensitivity were much less susceptible to influence by exchange of the other two segments of the protein. The marked difference in the response of the two catalytic domains to changes in the N-terminal domain and TM combinations explains the previously observed differences in the response of L- and M-CPT I to altered physiological state in intact mitochondria and to modulation of altered lipid molecular order of the mitochondrial outer membrane in vivo and in vitro.

CPT I catalyzes the first step in the transport of long-chain acyl groups from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix, where they undergo β-oxidation. Inhibition by malonyl-CoA is a major regulatory property of CPT I and confers to the enzyme the ability to signal to the cell the relative availability of carbohydrate and lipid fuels (see Ref. 1.Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholarfor recent review). Therefore, the enzyme plays a central role in the control of hepatic, cardiac, and skeletal muscle and pancreatic β-cell function and is a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of metabolic disorders ranging from diabetes to insulin resistance and coronary heart disease (2.Foley J.E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 3.McGarry J.D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: 500S-504SCrossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4.Ruderman N.B.

Metab. 1998; 11: 200-211Google Scholar) In mammals, CPT I exists as two distinct isoforms that are the products of different genes: the liver (L) type or α form and the muscle (M) type or β form (6.Esser V.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). When assayed in isolated mitochondria, these two CPT I variants differ markedly in key kinetic characteristics in that M-CPT I has a much lower IC50 for malonyl-CoA and a higher K m for l-carnitine than L-CPT I (8.Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9.McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). However, their affinity for long-chain acyl-CoA is not markedly different (9.McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). They also differ in their responses to altered physiological states (the malonyl-CoA sensitivity andK m for palmitoyl-CoA are altered only for L-CPT I (10.Mynatt R.L. Lappi M.D. Cook G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)) and incubation conditions of isolated mitochondria (L-CPT I shows pronounced hysteretic behavior with respect to malonyl-CoA, whereas M-CPT I does not (11.Lloyd A.C. Carpenter C.A. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 289-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)). CPT I is an integral membrane protein that has two transmembrane segments (TM1 and TM2) within the N-terminal 15% of its primary sequence (see Figs. 1 and 2) (12.Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the mitochondrial outer membrane, it adopts a polytopic orientation such that both the N- and C-terminal (catalytic) domains, composed of ∼46 and 651 residues, respectively, are exposed on the outer (cytosolic) surface of the membrane (12.Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13.Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. Soc.

A short loop of 27 amino acid residues connects the two transmembrane segments and protrudes into the intermembrane space between the outer and inner membranes of the mitochondrion (12.Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Previous results demonstrated that N/C-terminal domain interactions are important in determining the kinetic characteristics of L-CPT I (12.Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14.Zammit V.A. Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of the extreme N terminus causes total loss of the malonyl-CoA sensitivity of the enzyme and partial loss of its catalytic activity (12.Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, interactions of regions of the molecule with the membrane have been suggested to explain the marked dependence of the kinetic properties of the enzyme (particularly its malonyl-CoA sensitivity) on the molecular order of the membrane lipids bothin vivo (15.Zammit V. Corstorphine C. Kolodziej M. Fraser F. Lipids. 1998; 33: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and in vitro (16.Kolodziej M.P. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Functional mutagenesis studies have confirmed that the N-terminal 18 amino acid residues (and particularly Glu-3) of the L-CPT I protein are required for malonyl-CoA sensitivity (17.Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18.Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol.

Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Deletion of the N-terminal 30 amino acid residues of M-CPT I also largely abolishes its malonyl-CoA sensitivity (20.Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Figure 2Primary sequences of the N-terminal regions of the CPT I constructs with the positions of the N-terminal domain, TM1, loop, TM2, and the start of the C-terminal domain. A shows the sequences of the six chimeras generated. Regions corresponding to L-CPT I are shown in white on black, with those from M-CPT I in black on white. The two isoleucine residues shown in black on gray (residue 77 in LML and LMM) represent a conservatively changed amino acid present in neither of the parent molecules.

These isoforms are closely related in amino acid sequence, having an overall 62% sequence identity, with regions, including the cytosolic N-terminal sequence, of much higher similarity. They are therefore presumed to have the same overall structure (see Fig. 1). By determining the kinetic parameters of chimeras constructed from different domains of L- and M-CPT I isoforms, it was reasoned that it would be possible to elucidate the roles of different regions of the molecule in determining the distinctive properties of the two isoforms. Studies on other transmembrane proteins have shown that it is highly energetically favorable to have physical interaction between transmembrane helices (see Ref. 21.Zammit V. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 199-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, our chimeras were designed to perturb the native interactions between TM1 and TM2 and/or the putative interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains. For the purpose of these studies, the molecule was divided into three discrete regions: the N-terminal domain plus TM1, the loop plus TM2, and the C-terminal domain (see Fig. 1). Thus, six chimeras were constructed and expressed in Pichia pastoris, which has previously been shown to be a good expression system for CPT I (22.Zhu H. Shi J. de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,23.Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The use of an expression background free from endogenous CPT activity allowed detailed kinetic analyses to be performed. The kinetic parameters for the substrates carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA and the inhibitor malonyl-CoA were examined for the chimeric CPT I molecules and the two expressed parental enzymes. Our results reveal a more complex set of intramolecular interactions than has hitherto been reported (19.Swanson S.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The kinetic characteristics of chimeric proteins containing the C-terminal domain of L-CPT I are dependent on the precise pairings between the respective N- and C-terminal domains and between TM1 and TM2, but the C-terminal domain of M-CPT I is much less sensitive to alterations in these interactions. The results are discussed in relation to the differences in responses of the two isoforms to altered conditions both in vivo and in vitro. These were obtained as described previously (23.Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except where stated. Full-length cDNAs for the rat L-CPT I (LLL) and M-CPT I (MMM) isoforms were obtained by screening a rat skeletal muscle cDNA library (Stratagene no. 937510). Probes corresponding to nucleotides 82–534 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number L07736) of L-CPT I and nucleotides 21–512 of M-CPT I (accession number D43623) were generated by PCR from rat heart cDNA using oligonucleotides AGCAATAGGTCCCCACTCAA and GCTCATTTTGCCGTGTTCTG and oligonucleotides CCCAGGATGGCGGAAGCACACC and CCGGCTGGACAGGAGACGAACAC, respectively. Library screening was performed as described previously (23.Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs were excised from the libraries into pBluescript SK(−), and the sequences of the coding regions were verified to be identical to those already published. To generate the chimeras LLM and MML (see Fig. 2 A), a silentAflII restriction site (CTTAAG corresponding to amino acids Leu-Lys; residues 126 and 127 and residues 128 and 129 of the L- and M-type isoforms, respectively) was introduced into the cDNAs for both isoforms (shown in italics in the oligonucleotides below). This single nucleotide change was introduced by overlap extension PCR. For L-CPT I, two independent PCRs (20 cycles each) were performed with primers A (TTGCGGCCGCAATAGGTCCCCACT) and B (GCAGCACCTTAAGCGAGTAGCG) and primers C (GCTACTCGCTTAAGGTGCTGC) and D (TCCTCGAGGCCTTACAGATTCCAG) using the rat L-CPT I cDNA as template. The two products were annealed and reamplified for a further five cycles of PCR using primers A and D. The same method was used for rat M-CPT I using TTGCGGCCGCAGGATGGCGGAAGCACACCAGGCAGTA (primer E), GCAGCAGCTTAAGGGTTTGTCGGACCGACAAACCCTTAAGCTGCTGC, and primer F (GGTCTAGACAAGGGCCGCACAGAATCCA). In each case, a novelNotI site (shown in italics) was also introduced upstream of each of the respective start codons. All PCRs were performed usingPfu TURBO DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The LLL cDNA was subcloned into pGAPZ B using the NotI site from pBluescript and the naturally occurring EcoRI site in the 3′-untranslated region. The PCR product (containing theAflII site) was used to replace the 5′-ends of the cDNAs upstream of the unique KpnI site. The MMM cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 at the NotI-XhoI sites, using sites from the pBluescript vector. The 5′-end (NotI-HindIII) was then replaced with the PCR product, and the whole cDNA was transferred to pGAPZ B usingNotI and the XbaI site from the pcDNA vector. The sequence ATTTTTTTATTC (encoding amino acids 121–124, IFLF) in the M-CPT I cDNA, which resembles a known yeast polyadenylation signal, was subsequently changed to ATCTTCCTCTTC in an attempt to increase expression levels without changing the amino acid sequence. A cleaved PCR product (primer E, above, and AGCTTAAGAGTTTGTCGGAAGAGGAAGATGCCTGTCGCCCAG) was used to replace the NotI-AflII fragment. The chimeras LLM and MML (see Fig. 2 A) were generated from LLL and MMM by swapping the NotI-AflII restriction fragments. The chimeras LMM and MLL were generated individually. Briefly, LMM was made by replacing theSphI-AflII fragment of LLM (corresponding to the loop and TM2) with a PCR product generated from the corresponding region of M-CPT I (with the polyadenylation site removed), except that a 5′-SphI site was added and a single amino acid change (Val to Ile) was introduced into the loop (PCR primers ATGCATGCTAAAATCGATATCAGTATGGGGCTGGTCC and F above) (see Fig.2 A). MLL was made by replacing theNcoI-AflII region in MML with a PCR product generated from the corresponding region of L-CPT I with an added 5′-NcoI site (PCR primers TTCCTCCATGGGCATGATCGCAAAGAT and D above). LML and MLM were subsequently generated from LMM and MLL by swappingNotI-AflII restriction fragments. All the mutations and junctions were verified by sequencing. P. pastoris strain X-33 was used throughout these studies. All procedures were performed as recommended by the expression system distributor, Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Expression was driven by the constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (24.Waterham H.R. Digan M.E. Koutz P.J. Lair S.V. Cregg J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 186: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) using the vector pGAPZ. High copy number clones were selected where necessary using 0.5 or 1 mg/ml Zeocin. Cultures for activity measurements were grown for 24 h in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose), and cell-free extracts were prepared as described previously (23.Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CPT I activity was measured at different carnitine, palmitoyl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA concentrations, as indicated, as described previously (23.Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed on cell-free yeast extracts rather than mitochondrion-enriched fractions for reasons discussed previously (23.Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that for both L- and M-CPT I, identical kinetic behavior was observed in the two fractions (23.Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When concentrations of carnitine were varied, that of palmitoyl-CoA was fixed at 135 μm. When concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA were varied, that of carnitine was fixed at 500 μm. For malonyl-CoA inhibition studies, palmitoyl-CoA and carnitine concentrations were fixed at 35 and 500 μm, respectively. Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation for palmitoyl-CoA and carnitine or to the equation for simple competitive inhibition in the case of malonyl-CoA. Curve fitting was performed using Sigma-Plot software with nonlinear regression analysis as described previously (23.Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each of the three parameters (malonyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, and carnitine) and for each catalytic domain (L- or M-type), separate general linear models were used to examine the effects of the identity (L- or M-type) of the remaining two regions of the chimeric molecules. Where the two-way statistical interaction between the two regions was significant, Tukey's post-hoc multiple comparisons test was used to examine the differences between the four mean values. In general, it was found that residuals in the various models when applied to the raw data increased with the mean, and so the values were log-transformed prior to analysis. Since the data were unbalanced, to ensure thatp values were genuine, sequential sums of squares in the general linear model were also investigated with the order of the factors reversed, and in addition, the results were checked using the residual maximum likelihood method (REML). Minitab software (Version 12) was used to apply the general linear models, and Genstat 5 was used for REML. This study describes the first heterologous expression of rat M-CPT I in P. pastoris. In preliminary experiments, only very low levels of M-CPT I activity could be detected, even when selection for high copy number genomic integration events with high Zeocin concentrations was used. This was presumed to be due to premature termination of transcripts in AT-rich regions and has been observed in Pichia and other eukaryotic systems. In particular, the sequence TTTTTATA is known to promote premature polyadenylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and a similar sequence has been shown to cause termination when the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120 protein is expressed in P. pastoris (25.Scorer C.A. Buckholz R.G. Clare J.J. Romanos M.A. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). When the sequence TTTTTATTC present in rat M-CPT I (encoding amino acids 122–124) was mutated (without changing the amino acid sequence; see “Experimental Procedures”), higher levels of expressed activity were achieved, although it was still necessary to select for high copy number integrants. It is noteworthy that in human M-CPT I, the corresponding sequence is TTCTTCTTC, and the protein was readily expressed from the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter from single copy clones (22.Zhu H. Shi J. de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For rat L-CPT I, good levels of CPT activity were achieved when present at single copy within thePichia genome (after selecting for transformants with 0.1 mg/ml Zeocin). For the purpose of these studies, the molecule was divided into three discrete regions (Fig. 1) based on the primary amino acid sequence (Fig. 2): the N-terminal domain plus TM1, the loop plus TM2, and the C-terminal domain (residues 1–82, 83–126, and 127–772, respectively, in L-CPT I). Due to the low degree of sequence conservation observed in the loop of CPT I isoforms from different mammalian species and the low degree of functional importance inferred from the topology of the protein, this region was not considered separately, but in conjunction with TM2. The N-terminal domain shows a very high degree of sequence conservation between the L- and M-type isoforms (Fig. 2 A). In particular, the first 18 residues in L- and M-CPT I are identical in all known mammalian CPT I sequences. Therefore, the N-terminal domain was not addressed separately, but in combination with TM1. Using all combinations of the three regions allowed generation of six chimeras, plus the two parental molecules. No amino acids were omitted at the joins in the chimeras. The single conservative Val-77 → Ile change in LML and LMM (Fig. 2 A) is in the loop region and is also a substitution that occurs between rat or mouse and human in L-CPT I. The chimeras are referred to using a three-letter nomenclature as shown in Fig. 2 A. Thus, LLL and MMM refer to the two parental proteins. For chimeras containing the L-type catalytic domain, high levels of CPT activity were expressed from single copy clones. For chimeras containing the M-type C-terminal domain, high copy number integrants had to be used to achieve readily measurable activity levels, as was the case for the parental M-CPT I (MMM). In the constructs MML, LML, and LMM, the T-rich nucleotide sequence was altered as described above for MMM. All the kinetic characteristics of the expressed chimeras are given in Table I, but in the interests of clarity, they are considered separately, below, for those containing the L- or M-type catalytic domain.Table IKinetic parameters of CPT I chimerasConstructMalonyl-CoA IC50Palmitoyl-CoAK mCarnitine K mμmμmμmLiver series LLL38.4 ± 2.2 (4)46.0 ± 5.1 (3)153 ± 11 (3) MLL58.6 ± 6.2ap < 0.01 versus LLL and LML.

Velocity versus substrate/inhibitor concentration curves for palmitoyl-CoA, carnitine, and malonyl-CoA are given in Fig.3. For both carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA, the data obeyed standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics, thus enabling the accurate calculation of K m values by graphical methods. The assay conditions were designed (26.Drynan L. Quant P.A. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to give high values for the IC50 for malonyl-CoA (concentration required to inhibit CPT I activity by 50%). This enabled the more accurate determination of IC50 values, thus allowing the detection of subtle changes in this parameter. The IC50 for malonyl-CoA was the same for LLL and LML (38.4 ± 2.24 and 35.1 ± 4.1 μm, respectively), suggesting that TM1/TM2 interactions do not affect malonyl-CoA sensitivity as long as the N/C-terminal domain interactions (LxL) present in the parental form are maintained. By contrast, the chimeric enzymes MML and MLL both had IC50 values for malonyl-CoA that were >1.5-fold higher than those of the parental control (Table I), indicating that disruption of the N/C-terminal domain interactions negatively affects malonyl-CoA action. The same pattern of changes was observed for the affinity for palmitoyl-CoA as that observed above for malonyl-CoA (Table I). Thus, LLL and LML had very similarK m values (46.0 ± 5.1 and 36.9 ± 7.2 μm, respectively; not significantly different), whereas those for MML and MLL (63.9 ± 6.6 and 64.7 ± 6.5 μm, respectively) were both 1.5-fold higher (p < 0.01) than the value for the parental protein. Therefore, in chimeric CPT I proteins with the L-type catalytic domain, the effects of malonyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA on activity appear to be modulated by alterations in N/C-terminal domain interactions, whereas changes in TM1/TM2 interactions do not affect either parameter. The chimeric protein MML had the same K m for carnitine (173.6 ± 16.4 μm) as the parental protein, LLL (153.3 ± 11.1 μm), indicating that contrary to the case with malonyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA, alterations of N/C-terminal domain interactions did not affect this kinetic parameter (Table I). However, mismatching of the TM regions (in MLL or LML) resulted in a >2-fold increase in the K m for carnitine (to 369.5 ± 39.8 and 376.3 ± 49.1 μm, respectively), indicating that the matched TM1/TM2 interactions that are preserved when they both originate from either the L- or M-type isoform (as in MML or LLL) are crucial for retention of the low K m for carnitine displayed by L-CPT I (compared with that of M-CPT I; see below). The IC50 for malonyl-CoA of the parental enzyme MMM was 10-fold lower (3.3 ± 0.2 μm) than that of the parental L-CPT I (LLL). All the chimeras containing the M-type catalytic domain had very similar IC50 values (Table I), suggesting that the degree of malonyl-CoA sensitivity of the C-terminal domain of M-CPT I is determined solely by the structural characteristics within that domain and is not dependent on the identity of the rest of the molecule.

Following extraction from the lens, β-crystallins are found as soluble aggregates comprising two to eight subunits, which elute as two or three peaks from size exclusion fractionation, depending on the chromatographic conditions (1.Miesbauer L.R.

Early analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing showed that the β-crystallins from the three size exclusion fractions were heterogeneous mixtures and that the component proteins had different molecular masses and charges. Despite this heterogeneity, ultraviolet circular dichroism showed similar secondary and tertiary structures for the proteins from the three size exclusion fractions. They also appeared similar immunochemically (2.Zigler Jr., J.S. Horwitz J. Kinoshita J.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1980; 31: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although many components could be separated by electrophoresis, identification was not possible because the various β-crystallins are highly homologous with similar molecular masses and ranges of pI values. Chromatofocusing studies under nondenaturing conditions confirmed that the size exclusion fractions were populations of heterogeneous aggregates (9.Bloemendal H. Hendriks I. Body P. Exp.

Eye Res. 1998; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Analysis by mass spectrometry showed that there are six β-crystallins expressed in the human lens, βA1, βA3, βA4, βB1, βB2, and βB3. βB2 and βB1 are the predominant components; βB3 is detected only in infant lenses.The three β-crystallin fractions separated by size exclusion chromatography have been referred to by two sets of names, β1 (also called βH) at approximately 160 kDa, β2 (βL1) at about 80 kDa, and β3 (βL2) at 40 kDa. The major component of the largest molecular aggregates, βH, is βB1-crystallin while the major component of the lower molecular mass aggregates, βL1 and βL2, is βB2-crystallin (4.Ajaz M.S. Ma Z. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11250-11255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Intact βB1 is present only in the largest aggregate, βH. βB1-crystallins degraded at the N terminus are present in all the fractions, with the more extensively degraded forms more prevalent in the smaller aggregates.The ability of α-crystallin to suppress aggregation of denatured proteins has been demonstrated with mixtures of thermally stressed β-crystallins as the substrate (11.Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). The effects of α-crystallin modifications on this chaperone activity, which may be crucial to maintenance of lens transparency, have been considered in several investigations (12.Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 13.Smulders R.H.P.H. Carver J.A. Linders R.A. van Boekel M.A.M.

Commun. 1995; 208: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, information about the substrate β-crystallins is lacking. The solubility of the various crystallins and how their post-translational modifications affect solubility have not been characterized. Because the level of post-translational modification correlates with the age-related increase in insolubility and cataractogenesis, understanding which crystallins and what modifications lead to insolubility may contribute to elucidating the mechanism(s) of cataractogenesis. The goal of this investigation was to determine the solubilities of different β-crystallin gene products, as well as post-translationally modified βB2-crystallin. Recently developed analytical methods based on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)1 and mass spectrometry permitted these highly detailed measurements. The relative solubilities of these specific forms of β-crystallins were estimated by analyzing mixtures of β-crystallins to establish which forms were present in solution before and after heating. Analysis of resolubilized precipitant confirmed precipitation of specific forms of β-crystallins.RESULTSThe goal of this study was to determine which β-crystallins were easily precipitated when heat denatured and which were thermally stable and remained in the supernatant. Analysis of the unheated β-crystallins served as a control to show which β-crystallins, modified and unmodified, were present prior to heating. The analysis included comparison of the components of the supernatants and precipitants and the structural differences between βB2-crystallins in the two portions.Reversed Phase HPLCThe chromatograms of the size exclusion and reversed phase HPLC isolations of the β-crystallins from the five lenses showed little lens to lens variation. However, the HPLC chromatograms demonstrated that the components of the supernatant and precipitant were different. Because of the similarity in the data for the five lenses, data from only one lens, a 64-year-old donor, are presented. Representative reversed phase chromatograms are shown in Fig. 1. The chromatogram for β-crystallins before heat treatment (Fig. 1 A) showed two large peaks and one small peak, similar to previously reported results for human lens β-crystallins (10.Ma Z. Hanson S.R. Lampi K. David L. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For samples from young lenses, the proteins in these three peaks are βB2 in the first peak, βA1/βA3 in the second, and a mixture of βB1/βA4 in the third (10.Ma Z. Hanson S.R. Lampi K. David L. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For samples from older lenses, as were used in this study, mass spectrometric analysis has demonstrated the presence of minor amounts of βB2 and βA1/A3 in the third peak. There was also an additional late eluting broad peak which is a mixture of several β-crystallins. 3J. Feng, D. L. Smith, and J. B. Smith, unpublished data. Comparison of the UV absorbance of the β-crystallins that remained soluble after heating with the absorbance of the unheated sample indicated that, for all five lenses, approximately 20 ± 3% of the protein remained in solution (TableI). The reversed phase HPLC chromatogram of the supernatant β-crystallins showed that the β-crystallins remaining in solution were primarily βB2 (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the chromatogram of the precipitant portion showed peaks for βB1/βA4 and βA1/βA3 at approximately the same ratio as in the unheated sample, and a much smaller peak for βB2 (Fig.1 C). The UV absorbance of the collected fractions from the five lenses, indicated that much (73–92%) of the βA1/A3, βB1, and βA4 precipitated, while approximately 82% of the βB2 remained in solution (Table I). The small portion of βB2 eluting with the βB1/βA4 peak was not included in these estimates. These results demonstrated that βB2 crystallin is more soluble than the other β-crystallins when heated at 66 °C for 30 min.Table IPartitioning of β-crystallins from five human eye lenses between the supernatant and precipitant formed by heat denaturationSample/lens12345Total β-crystallins remaining in supernatantaDetermined from UV absorbances (280 nm).18%20%22%20%23%βB2 remaining in supernatantbDetermined from HPLC chromatograms.85%77%80%88%82%Other βs remaining in supernatantbDetermined from HPLC chromatograms.19%9%27%8%9%Glutathione adductscDetermined from the relative peak heights in the mass spectra.

Open table in a new tab Molecular Mass Determination of βB2-crystallinReversed phase HPLC separated nearly all of the βB2 from the other β-crystallins, but the modified and unmodified forms of βB2 co-eluted. To identify the modifications, the molecular masses of the components of the βB2 fractions from all three preparations, unheated, supernatant and precipitant, were determined by mass spectrometry. The most intense peaks in the mass spectra of all three preparations agreed with the molecular mass calculated from the sequence of βB2 (M r 23,291) (5.Miesbauer L.R. Smith J.B. Smith D.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 290-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Fig.2, A-C). Note that the uncertainty in the molecular mass measurements was ±3 Da. For three of the five lenses, a minor component with a mass of 23,594 Da was also detected. The presence of this mass was attributed to a glutathione adduct (+305 Da) to βB2-crystallin (calculatedM r 23,596) (16.Smith J.B. Shun-Shin G.A. Sun Y. Miesbauer L.R. Yang Z. Yang Z. Zhou X. Schwedler J. Smith D.L. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The extent of glutathione modification of βB2-crystallin was 9, 10, and 20% in the three lenses. For all three lenses, the glutathione-modified βB2-crystallin remained soluble after heating. The glutathione adducts in the precipitant were below the detection limit (<3%) of these determinations. Representative results are shown for the same 64-year-old lens (Fig. 2). The glutathione adduct was evident in the unheated (Fig. 2 A) and supernatant (Fig. 2 B) portions, but not in the precipitant (Fig. 2 C). The presence of glutathione adducts in supernatant βB2 but not in precipitated βB2 indicates that βB2-crystallins with a glutathione adduct are more soluble than unmodified βB2. No additional peaks were evident after heating in either the precipitant or supernatant that were not present in the control sample, indicating that no modifications had been formed by heating.Figure 2Mass spectra of the proteins in the βB2 peaks (the first peak) from the corresponding samples described in the legend to Fig. 1. The calculated mass of βB2 is 23,291 Da. The experimental uncertainty of the ESIMS molecular mass determination is 0.015% or ± 3 Da for βB2-crystallin. The peak at 23,594 Da fits βB2 with a glutathione adduct (+305 Da).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Formation of an intra-molecular disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues (−2 Da) is an in vivo modification to human βB2 (17.Takemoto L.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 64: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that causes a mass change too small to be detected from the molecular mass of the whole protein. To distinguish between the extent of disulfide bonding in the supernatant and precipitant βB2-crystallins, the βB2-crystallins from each portion were treated with iodoacetamide, which adds 57 Da to each free cysteine. βB2 has two cysteinyl residues, Cys-37 and Cys-66. The mass spectra for the carboxyamidomethylated βB2 demonstrated the presence of a disulfide bond in four of the five lenses, two with 9% disulfide bonded, one with 11%, and one with 25%. After heating, the disulfide-bonded βB2 was detected only in the precipitated portion. Mass spectra for βB2 from the same 64-year-old lens from the unheated portion, the supernatant and the precipitant are shown in Figs.3, A-C, respectively. Although the mass of the major peak in all three spectra wasM r 23,405, consistent with derivitization of two Cys residues in βB2, the unheated and precipitant βB2-crystallins also had peaks indicative of βB2 with a disulfide bond (calculatedM r 23,289). The supernatant did not include a peak for the disulfide-bonded form. There is also a small peak at 23,653 Da in the unheated and supernatant samples, consistent with the fact that βB2 with a glutathione adduct has only one cysteine available for reaction with iodoacetamide. The observation of disulfide-bonded βB2 in the precipitants, but not in the supernatants from all of the lenses indicates that βB2 with a disulfide bond has a lower solubility than unmodified βB2.Figure 3Mass spectra of the carboxyamidomethylated βB2 from the corresponding samples described in the legend to Fig. 1. The mass at 23,405 Da is consistent with the addition of 114 Da, indicating the presence of two free cysteines. The small peak at mass 23,288 Da indicates the presence of βB2 with an intra-molecular disulfide bond. The peak at 23,653 Da fits βB2 with one cysteine modified by glutathione (+305 Da) and the other by carboxyamidomethylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Molecular Mass Determinations of Tryptic Peptides of βB2-crystallinThe peptides formed by tryptic digestion of the βB2-crystallins from the unheated sample and the supernatant and precipitant portions were each fractionated by capillary reverse phase HPLC connected to a mass spectrometer. The molecular masses of all observed tryptic peptides were in agreement with the calculated molecular masses of the expected peptides produced by trypsin digestion of βB2-crystallin, and indicated the nature and location of post-translational modifications.Location of the Glutathione Adduct in βB2-crystallinAlthough the molecular mass determinations of intact βB2-crystallin demonstrated clearly that some βB2-crystallins in the unheated and supernatant portions had one glutathione adduct, the particular cysteine involved could not be determined from these data. However, the analysis of the tryptic peptides gave evidence of the location of the glutathione adduct. There were peaks at mass/charge (m/z) 1317.7 for the triply charged form, and m/z 988.4 for the quadruple charged form, of a peptide with a mass of 3950 Da in the digests of the unheated βB2-crystallins (Fig.4 A) and the supernatant βB2-crystallins after heating (Fig. 4 B), but not in the precipitated βB2-crystallins (Fig. 4 C). This peptide corresponded to βB2 peptide 48–80, which includes Cys-66, with a glutathione attached. With the glutathione adduct at Cys-66, the usual tryptic cleavages at Lys-67 and Lys-75 did not occur, possibly due to steric hindrance. A portion of the spectrum from tandem mass (MS/MS) analysis of the triply charged ion at m/z 1317.7 is shown in Fig. 5. The numbering system is according to Roepstorff and Fohlman (18.Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). Masses of they“ series fragments,y”3-y“14, including residues 67–80, were consistent with the calculated values, while fragments, y”15-y“30,which included Cys-66 were 305 Da larger than expected. Also b-series fragments b5-b18, derived from residues N-terminal to Cys-66 had the expected masses, while the b-series fragments that included Cys-66 were 305 Da larger. These results confirmed the peptide assignment and placed the glutathione adduct at Cys-66. Absence of a peptide at m/z 1317.7 in the precipitant supported the contention that βB2-crystallin modified with a glutathione was more soluble and stayed in the supernatant portion during heating. There was no evidence for a glutathione adduct at Cys-37 in any of the digests.Figure 4Mass spectra showing the triply charged (m/z 1317.7) and quadruple charged (m/z 988.4) peptides of βB2 48–80 with a glutathione adduct.

Deamidation of glutamine or asparagine residues, a 1-dalton mass increase, can be readily detected by analysis of digested proteins (19.Hanson S.R.A. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The mass spectral data from the tryptic digests of βB2 from the supernatant and precipitant as well as the unheated control were searched for evidence of deamidated peptides. Deamidation was found in βB2 peptide 1–17 and peptide 172–187 from two of the lenses, but the extent of deamidation was similar for all three portions, indicating that deamidation had little effect on the susceptibility of βB2 to heat denaturation and precipitation.DISCUSSIONThe heat stability of the principal β-crystallin, βB2 (formerly called βBp) has been the basis for isolating βB2 from the other β-crystallins (20.Mostafapour M.K. Schwartz C.A. Curr. Eye Res. 1982; 1: 517-552Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 21.McFall-Ngai M. Horwitz J. Ding L.-L. Lacey L. Curr. Eye Res. 1986; 5: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Early reports indicated that βB2-crystallin did not precipitate even when heated to 100 °C, even though it showed a reversible order-disorder transition at about 58 °C (22.Maiti M. Kono M. Chakrabarti B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The results of this study confirmed that relatively pure βB2 can be isolated from other β-crystallins by taking advantage of the increased propensity of other β-crystallins to precipitate when heated. When β-crystallins were heated, much of the βA1/A3, βB1, and βA4 were precipitated, while only about 20% of the βB2 precipitated. The relative stability of βB2 toward heating is consistent with studies showing very little βB2 among the water-insoluble crystallins (23.Lund A.L. Smith J.B. Smith D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). 4S. R. A. Hanson, A. Hasan, D. L. Smith, and J. B. Smith, submitted for publication. A useful approximation of the hydrophilicity of a protein can be obtained by summing the hydrophilicity of the component amino acids, even though the accuracy of this summation is limited by the fact that it does not consider effects due to the conformation of the protein. Summation of the Bull and Breese (BB) indices (25.Bull H.B. Breese K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 161: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) for the β-crystallins yields +62 for βB2, which is more hydrophilic than βB1 (BB+5), βA4 (BB+30), and βA3 (BB+27). With the BB index, the more hydrophilic residues have more positive numbers. These summations suggest that the higher solubility of βB2 compared with the other β-crystallins may be due, in part, to the hydrophilicity of its component amino acids. This difference in solubility between βB2 and the other β-crystallins may also be related to the fact that βB2 remains intact in the aging lens while other β-crystallins, notably βA3/A1 and βB1 become extensively truncated at the N terminus, removing hydrophilic N-terminal portions (8.Lampi K.J. Ma Z. Shih M. Shearer T.R. Smith J.B. Smith D.L. David L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2268-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 10.Ma Z. Hanson S.R. Lampi K. David L. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The remaining protein fragments are even more hydrophobic, for example, βB1 36–251 (BB-55) and βA3 23–215 (BB+3).The high solubility of βB2 compared with the other β-crystallins suggests that it may play an unique role in maintaining transparency. A previous study in our laboratory showed that βB2 is found both as homo- and heterodimers and oligomers, while oligomers of the other β-crystallins include βB2 (4.Ajaz M.S. Ma Z. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11250-11255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have also noted that separation of βB2 from the other β-crystallins leaves a β-crystallin mixture that is much less soluble. 5J. Feng, D. L. Smith, and J. B. Smith, unpublished observations. It may be that formation of oligomers containing βB2 contributes to the solubility of the other β-crystallins, particularly as they become more hydrophobic due to age-related modifications. The low solubility of the late eluting β-crystallins, which include small amounts of βB2, raises the question of whether these βB2-crystallins are modified and whether such modified βB2-crystallins might affect the solubility of other β-crystallins.In this study, the conditions for precipitation of the β-crystallins were such that βB2-crystallin was distributed in both the supernatant (∼83%) and precipitant (∼17%). A major advantage of using mass spectrometry for determining protein molecular masses is that most modifications cause a change in molecular mass that can be easily detected. Because the uncertainty in an ESIMS mass determination is ∼0.015% (only 2–3 Da for βB2), modifications such as truncation, phosphorylation, acetylation, carbamylation, addition of oxygen, and cross-links are all easily detected. Disulfide bonds and deamidation are the only common modifications not detected by the ESIMS determination of a protein molecular mass. Obtaining a molecular mass of 23,291 Da for the major peak from βB2 in the supernatant and precipitant demonstrated that most βB2 in both portions was unmodified except for disulfide bonds and deamidation. Additional procedures were used to distinguish the disulfide-bonded and deamidated βB2. The structural differences between the βB2-crystallins in the supernatant and precipitated portions demonstrated effects of glutathione adducts, disulfide bonds, and deamidation on the heat stability of βB2. Two of the modifications showed marked differences in their solubility. βB2 modified by a glutathione adduct remained in the supernatant while βB2 modified by a disulfide bond was precipitated. Deamidation was equally prevalent in both portions. These results support hypotheses suggesting a major role for Cys residues in crystallin solubility and perhaps cataractogenesis. Lou (26.Lou M.F. Green K. Edelhauser H.F. Hackett R.B. Hull D.S. Potter D.E. Tripathi R.E. Advances in Ocular Toxicology. Plenum Press, New York1997: 27-46Crossref Google Scholar) has proposed that mixed disulfides, such as the glutathione adducts observed in these experiments, may be precursors to disulfide cross-links between cysteinyl residues, a modification that could lead to the high molecular mass aggregates and insolubility associated with cataract. The results of this experiment do not elucidate whether glutathione adducts are precursors to cross-links between cysteines or block the formation of such cross-links. However, the presence of glutathione adducts in the supernatant, but not the precipitant, supports contentions that glutathione adducts have a solubilizing effect (24.Kamei A. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1993; 16: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The presence of disulfide-bonded βB2 among the precipitated crystallins, but not the supernatant, supports a role for this modification in insolubilization and is consistent with observation of extensive disulfide bonding among the water-insoluble crystallins (23.Lund A.L. Smith J.B. Smith D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).4 Approximately half the human lens crystallins are classified as β-crystallins. Following extraction from the lens, β-crystallins are found as soluble aggregates comprising two to eight subunits, which elute as two or three peaks from size exclusion fractionation, depending on the chromatographic conditions (1.Miesbauer L.R.

However, one of these two components is sometimes lacking. In Drosophila acetylcholinesterase, the two phases are present, allowing both phenomena to be studied. Several kinetic schemes can explain this complex kinetic behavior. Among them, one model assumes that activation results from the binding of a substrate molecule to a non-productive site affecting the entrance of a substrate molecule into the active site. To test this hypothesis, we looked for an inhibitor competitive for activation and we found Triton X-100. Using organophosphates or carbamates as hemisubstrates, we showed that Triton X-100 inhibits or increases phosphorylation or carbamoylation of the enzyme. In vitro mutagenesis of the residues lining the active site gorge allowed us to locate the Triton X-100 binding site at the rim of the gorge with glutamate 107 playing the major role. These results led to the hypothesis that substrate binding at this site affects the entrance of another substrate molecule into the active site cleft.

These results led to the hypothesis that substrate binding at this site affects the entrance of another substrate molecule into the active site cleft. acetylcholinesterase critical micellar concentration product Substrate Cholinesterases belong to the family of serine hydrolases. In vertebrates, they are present in two forms: acetylcholinesterase (AChE,1 EC 3.1.1.7), which hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in order to stop nervous impulse transmission at the cholinergic synapses, and butyrylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8), for which the physiological role is not well known. Two substrate binding sites are present on these enzymes: the catalytic site, located at the bottom of a gorge (the so-called “catalytic gorge”; Ref. 1.Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar), and a peripheral site that can bind various ligands bearing a quaternary ammonium (2.Changeux J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1966; 2: 369-392PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Roufogalis B.D. Quist E.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1972; 8: 41-49PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the substrate occurs in three steps (1.Sussman J.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6296-6305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): (i) formation of an enzyme-substrate complex, (ii) acylation of the enzyme, and (iii) deacylation by hydrolysis. To analyze the first two steps, we can use a hemisubstrate: an organophosphate. Phosphorylation of the active serine by this compound can be considered as irreversible since dephosphorylation is a very slow step, the half-life for hydrolysis of the phosphoryl enzyme being measured in days (7.Rosenberry T.L. Bernhard S.A. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4114-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In insects, only one form of the enzyme, called acetylcholinesterase, is present in the central nervous system. While in vertebrates, AChE is inhibited by excess substrate and butyrylcholinesterase is activated by low substrate concentrations (8.Nachmanson D. Wilson I.B. Acta Enzymol. 1951; 12: 259-339Google Scholar), insect AChE combines both types of kinetic behavior, suggesting that the two phenomena are independent and result from different bindings, and not from different manifestations, acceleration or inhibition of catalysis, of the same binding (9.Marcel V. Gagnoux-Palacios L. Pertuy C. Masson P. Fournier D. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In a recent paper (10.Stojan J. Marcel V. Estrada-Mondaca S. Klaebe A. Masson P. Fournier D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we proposed a kinetic scheme to describe this complex kinetic behavior. The scheme suggests the existence of a high affinity non-productive site for the substrate. The binding of a substrate molecule to this site has the consequence of slowing down the positioning of a second substrate molecule at the active site, resulting in an apparent activation of the enzyme. In order to precisely analyze the activation phenomenon observed, we searched for a reversible inhibitor that binds only to the activation site. Among several AChE inhibitors tested: choline, tetramethylammonium, edrophonium (11.Stojan J. Marcel M. Fournier D. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1999; 119–120: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), propidium, and Triton X-100, only the latter affected activation by the substrate. Triton X-100 is a non-ionic detergent that is widely used to solubilize membrane-bound proteins, but it has also been described to inhibit cholinesterase activity (12.Millar D.B. Christopher J.P. Bishop W.H. Biophys. Chem. 1979; 10: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 13.Kamaric L. Period. Biol. 1982; 84: 143-146Google Scholar, 14.Johnson C.D. Russell R.L. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 30-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We used this molecule in inhibition experiments and found that it is in competition with the substrate for binding at the activation site. Comparing the phosphorylation rate constants of several mutated enzymes, we saw that Triton X-100 binds at the rim of the gorge and, as a consequence, inhibits the enzyme activity by hindering access to the entrance of the active site, thus decreasing the acylation step. Triton X-100, polyethylene glycol, reduced Triton X-100, edrophonium, and propidium were from Sigma. As Triton X-100 is a mixture of two chain lengths (n = 9 and 10), its concentration will be expressed in g·liter−1. Truncated cDNA encoding soluble AChE ofDrosophila melanogaster was expressed with the baculovirus system (15.Chaabihi H. Fournier D. Fedon Y. Bossy J.P. Ravallec M. Devauchelle G. Cérutti M.

The concentration of the enzymes was determined by active site titration using 7-(methylethoxyphosphinyloxy)-1-methylquinolinium iodide, which was synthesized as described by Levy and Ashani (17.Levy D.

Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21124) Google Scholar), at substrate concentrations from 2 μm to 200 mm in 1-cm path length cuvettes using a Safas DES spectrophotometer. Activity was measured for 1 min, from 10 to 70 s after addition of the enzyme to the mixture. k obs is the number of micromoles of product formed/s/μmol of enzyme. Enzyme inhibition by Triton X-100 was studied at different inhibitor concentrations (0–10 g·liter−1). The rate data were analyzed by multiple non-linear regression using non-linear global optimization based on simulated annealing. 2J. Czaplicki, V. Marcel, and D. Fournier, manuscript in preparation. The rate constant of enzyme phosphorylation or carbamoylation was determined by the dilution method of Aldridge (21.Aldrige W.N. Biochem. J. 1950; 46: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar); at time 0, the organophosphorous compound or the carbamate was added to enzyme solutions (∼10 nm) in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, with 1 mg·ml−1 bovine serum albumin. Inhibition of the enzyme with time was followed by measuring the free enzyme concentration after dilution in the presence of substrate. The inhibition followed pseudo-first order kinetics since the concentration of the irreversible inhibitor was always at least 10-fold higher than the enzyme concentration. ki=−ln [E][E0]/t[PX0]Equation 1 [E] and [E]0 are the enzyme concentrations at times t and 0, respectively and [PX 0], the organophosphate (or carbamate) concentration. The experimental phosphorylation (or carbamoylation) rate constants (k i(obs)) were estimated in the presence of different concentrations of Triton X-100, reduced Triton X-100, or polyethylene glycol (0–10 g·liter−1). The critical micellar concentration (CMC) of Triton X-100 was determined in 25 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7 and 25 °C, using the method described by Ross and Olivier (22.Ross S. Olivier P. J. Phys. Chem. 1959; 63: 1671-1674Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Triton X-100 was mixed at various concentrations with a 30 mg·liter−1 iodide solution. Then the absorbance was determined at 360 nm. The plot of OD versus [Triton X-100] is linear below and above the CMC with different slopes. The point of intersection of the two extrapolated straight lines yields the CMC. Building and optimization of three-dimensional models of Triton X-100/Drosphila AChE were performed on a Silicon Graphics IRIS workstation using Biosym modeling software with a Drosophila AChE scheme built by homology with the Torpedo enzyme (19.Stojan J. J. Enzyme Inhib. 1999; 14: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) with five layers of surrounding water molecules. Docking was performed using a distance constraint between the iso-octyl part of Triton X-100 and the amino acid at position 107. Molecular dynamics calculations were carried out as follows; the structure was equilibrated at 300 K for 20 ps, followed by subsequent 10-ps dynamic runs at 300 K. Second, after minimization, the same sequence was applied without any constraints on the whole system. Acetylthiocholine hydrolysis by Drosophila AChE was studied in the presence of different concentrations of Triton X-100 (0–10 g·liter−1). As opposed to electric eel AChE (12.Millar D.B. Christopher J.P. Bishop W.H. Biophys. Chem. 1979; 10: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), the activity of the enzyme in the presence of Triton X-100 was found to be linear with time. Thus, Triton X-100 was considered to be a reversible inhibitor. Several kinetic models can be used to describe substrate hydrolysis by the Drosophila enzyme (9.Marcel V. Gagnoux-Palacios L. Pertuy C. Masson P. Fournier D. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The one proposed by Cauet et al. (23.Cauet G. Friboulet A. Thomas D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1987; 65: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and reduced to Scheme 1 describes activation and inhibition by substrate and leads to the determination of kinetic parameters (10.Stojan J.

Ks andK′s represent the affinity of the activation site for a substrate molecule. This scheme was chosen because it can be further reduced when the deacylation step is ignored, i.e.when organophosphorous compounds are used as substrates instead of acetylcholine (see below). Inhibition by Triton X-100 (Fig. 1) was analyzed assuming that two molecules of Triton X-100 can bind at two sites, a catalytic site and a peripheral site, whether the enzyme is free or acetylated, as tetramethylammonium does (11.Stojan J. Marcel M. Fournier D. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1999; 119–120: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We derived a complete scheme, and the resulting kinetic equation was used to simultaneously analyze 11-pS curves obtained with Triton X-100 concentrations varying from 1 mg·liter−1 to 100 g·liter−1. In a second step, we eliminated inoperative constants and the scheme became reduced to Scheme 2 without any decrease of goodness of fit.

Triton X-100 binds competitively with the substrate at the non-productive, or activation, site. TE represents the binding of a Triton X-100 molecule onto the activation site; c and d represent the effects of activation site occupation by Triton X-100 on acylation and deacylation, respectively. kobs=kcat[S]1+a[S]Ks′+d[T]Kt′kcatka 1+a[S]Ks′+d[T]Kt′1+[S]Ks+[T]Kt1+b[S]Ks+c[T]Kt+[S]1+[S]Ks′+[T]Kt′Equation 2 Non-linear fit allowed the estimation of some constants: affinity of Triton X-100 for the free enzyme, Kt = 0.033 ± 0.003 g·liter−1; effect of Triton X-100 binding on acylation, c = 0.136 ± 0.04. However, the affinity of Triton X-100 for acetylated enzyme,K′t , was above 10 g·liter−1 and therefore could not be estimated and the effect of Triton X-100 on deacetylation, d, correlated with K′t could not be determined either. Thus, Triton X-100 is a competitive inhibitor of activation by the substrate. According to Scheme 2, Triton X-100 decreases acetylation of the enzyme to 13.6%. To test this scheme, we used hemisubstrates, substrates for which the second step of the reaction (dealkylation or dephosphorylation) does not take place during the time of the experiment. We observed an inhibition of phosphorylation by malaoxon with increasing concentrations of Triton X-100, up to a plateau (Fig.2 A). Initially, we thought that malaoxon was trapped in the hydrophobic core of Triton X-100 micelles and, consequently, the concentration of the organophosphate available for the enzyme would be overevaluated. However, two observations led us to reject this hypothesis. First, phosphorylation was already diminished at a concentration below the CMC, 0.28 g·liter−1 in the experimental conditions used. Second, no effect of Triton X-100 on phosphorylation was detected with theTorpedo AChE (Fig. 2 B). Thus, both results suggest that inhibition of the phosphorylation constant by Triton X-100 originated from an interaction of Triton X-100 with theDrosophila enzyme and not from an artifact. Phosphorylation can be analyzed with Scheme 3, which is identical to Scheme 2 when deacetylation of the enzyme is negligible.

Indeed, above 3 μm, inhibition was too fast and, below 0.1 μm, the kinetics were no longer pseudo first-order since the free inhibitor concentration cannot be considered as constant. As a consequence, it was not possible to estimate the affinity of malaoxon for the non-productive site (Kpx) or the effect of occupation of the non-productive site on phosphorylation (b). Then, Scheme 3 was reduced to Scheme 4, where ki corresponds to the overall inhibition constant. TE+PX →cki TEp⥮Kt T +E+PX →ki Ep SCHEME 4 kobs=ki1+c[T]Kt1+[T]KtEquation 3 The phosphorylation rates observed (k obs) were determined at different concentrations of Triton X-100 (0–10 g·liter−1) allowing the estimation of Triton X-100 affinity (Kt) and the effect of Triton X-100 on phosphorylation (c): Kt = 0.06 ± 0.02 g·liter−1 and c = 0.18 ± 0.04. These estimations are in agreement with c andKt values obtained by measuring acetylthiocholine hydrolysis inhibition according to Scheme 3. Triton X-100 inhibits phosphorylation of the active site by malaoxon, suggesting that activation of substrate hydrolysis results from inhibition of active site acetylation since Triton X-100 binds at the activation site. Scheme 4 was used to study the effect of Triton X-100 on other hemisubstrates. The results are presented in TableI. It appears that Triton X-100 affects phosphorylation or carbamoylation of the serine; for some compounds such as paraoxon, it decreases the phosphorylation rate but for other compounds, such as aldicarbe or metamidophos, Triton X-100 significantly increases the phosphorylation or carbamoylation rate. Thus, binding of a substrate molecule at the activation site may either increase or decrease the acylation of the enzyme. Inhibition of phosphorylation by Triton X-100 was studied in the presence of two inhibitors specific for anionic and peripheral sites, edrophonium or propidium. The data were analyzed with Scheme 5, which is an extension of Scheme 4. SCHEME 5 kobs=ki1+a1.[T]Kt+a2.[I]Ki+b.[I].[T]Ki.Kt′1+[I]Ki+[T]Kt+[I].[T]Ki.Kt′Equation 4 I represents edrophonium or propidium, and T indicates the Triton X-100. Both inhibitors decreased the phosphorylation rate; results of the fit are presented in Fig. 3. With propidium, including the ternary complex (ITE) did not improve the fit, suggesting that the two inhibitors, Triton X-100 and propidium, are competitive, i.e. that they cannot bind simultaneously to the enzyme; their respective binding sites are overlapping. By contrast, simultaneous binding of edrophonium and Triton X-100 to the enzyme was revealed becauseK′t was operative for the fit, suggesting that the two binding sites are different. Taking in account that propidium binds at the rim of the active site gorge while edrophonium binds at the bottom of the gorge, this suggests that Triton X-100 binds at the rim of the gorge. In order to obtain information on the Triton X-100 binding site, we analyzed the phosphorylation of several mutated enzymes in the presence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 4).Kt , ki , and cwere determined (Table II). The mutations E107Y and E107W strongly increased the affinity of Triton X-100; mutants W359L and D413G moderately increased the affinity while mutants Y412A, E107K, and Y109K slightly decreased the affinity of Triton X-100. On the other hand, some mutations affected the cfactor. When classified following their effects, mutations E107W, E107Y, and D413G increased inhibition by Triton X-100 while mutations W359L, Y362A, Y111Q, and Y412A slightly decreased the effect of Triton X-100.Table IIKinetic parameters obtained for the inhibition of malaoxon phosphorylation by Triton X-100 with various mutated enzymesEnzymesk iK tcmm −1 · s −1g · liter −1Wild type37 ± 10.060 ± 0.0150.180 ± 0.040E107Y(Y70)330 ± 4.10.005 ± 0.00040.013 ± 0.008E107W(Y70)179 ± 90.008 ± 0.00200.011 ± 0.004E107K(Y70)8 ± 60.140 ± 0.08000.250 ± 0.090E107L(Y70)54 ± 40.012 ± 0.00300.054 ± 0.025R108V(V71)23 ± 60.023 ± 0.00600.080 ± 0.040Y109D(D72)41 ± 60.059 ± 0.01200.210 ± 0.030Y109K(D72)17 ± 60.140 ± 0.08000.250 ± 0.090Y111Q(Q74)71 ± 2.20.075 ± 0.03000.550 ± 0.040F115S(F78)9 ± 10.040 ± 0.03000.320 ± 0.090W121A(W84)0.9 ± 0.030.054 ± 0.01100.150 ± 0.040E275G(E199)1 ± 0.030.080 ± 0.04000.340 ± 0.050G303A(G227)12.3 ± 0.80.040 ± 0.02000.260 ± 0.060W309G(W233)2.3 ± 0.040.040 ± 0.00700.110 ± 0.020V356D(D276)56 ± 50.030 ± 0.02000.130 ± 0.080W359L(W279)60 ± 20.015 ± 0.00800.680 ± 0.030Y362A(F284)63 ± 20.090 ± 0.04000.600 ± 0.040L366F(F288)37 ± 0.60.068 ± 0.01100.150 ± 0.020F368L(F290)58 ± 40.076 ± 0.04600.320 ± 0.080Y408F(F330)137 ± 30.030 ± 0.00600.110 ± 0.020F409G(F331)45 ± 1.10.068 ± 0.02300.453 ± 0.031Y412A(Y334)166 ± 40.190 ± 0.06000.480 ± 0.040D413G(G335)77.8 ± 3.10.019 ± 0.00310.059 ± 0.021Constants are analyzed using equation 3.

Triton X-100 includes a hydrophobic part, the aromatic ring, coupled with a hydrocarbon chain and a hydrophilic part, the polyethylene glycol chain. To evaluate the involvement of each part of the molecule in its recognition by the activation site, we studied the inhibition of the wild type enzyme by malaoxon in the presence of polyethylene glycol or reduced Triton X-100. It was ground that reduced Triton X-100 presents the same affinity as Triton X-100, while the affinity of polyethylene glycol was much lower (K PEG = 2.64 ± 1.76 g·liter−1). Triton X-100 is a detergent widely used to solubilize membrane-anchored proteins such as insect cholinesterase, which is linked to the membrane via a glycolipid (24.Fournier D. Bergé J.B. Cardoso de Almeida M.L. Bordier C. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,25.Haas R. Marshall T.C. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6453-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Devonshire (26.Devonshire A. Biochem. J. 1975; 149: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) noted that Triton X-100 increased the apparentK m for the substrate, but activation was not evidenced because the presence of the glycolipid anchor did not allow complete elimination of the detergent from the solution. In vitro expression of a soluble cholinesterase, devoid of any lipid anchor, allowed kinetic studies to be performed in the absence of detergent, activation to be demonstrated at low substrate concentration (9.Marcel V. Gagnoux-Palacios L. Pertuy C. Masson P. Fournier D. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the effect of Triton X-100 to be studied. It appears that this molecule is a competitive inhibitor of activation with a dissociation constant of 0.033 g·liter−1. Since kinetic models resulting from analysis of pS curves predicted that apparent activation may result from an increase or a decrease of the acylation rate constant depending on the scheme chosen (9.Marcel V. Gagnoux-Palacios L. Pertuy C. Masson P. Fournier D. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10.Stojan J. Marcel V. Estrada-Mondaca S. Klaebe A. Masson P. Fournier D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we looked for a hemisubstrate, for which the second step, deacylation, is negligible. As phosphorylation by organophosphate is considered to be equivalent to acylation by acetylcholine, organophosphates and carbamates were used to evaluate the effect of Triton X-100 on the “acylation” step. As previously observed by Devonshire (26.Devonshire A. Biochem. J. 1975; 149: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we found a decrease of the phosphorylation rate constant with malaoxon in the presence of Triton X-100; however, using other hemisubstrates, we found that Triton X-100 can either increase or decrease the acylation rate. Triton X-100 increases or only partially inhibits phosphorylation and thus does not compete with irreversible inhibitors at the productive site. This is the first evidence that Triton X-100 most probably binds to a peripheral site. As a reference, edrophonium, which binds at the productive site, totally suppresses phosphorylation by malaoxon (a1 is not significantly different from zero). However, this result does not give information about the location of this peripheral site. Binding of Triton X-100 and propidium were competitive, suggesting that the ternary complex, Triton X-100-propidium-enzyme, does not exist. So the binding sites for Triton X-100 and propidium are identical or overlapping. In vitro mutagenesis was used to locate the Triton X-100 binding site independently. Triton X-100 inhibition of phosphorylation by malaoxon was observed with the Drosophila enzyme, but Triton X-100 did not significantly affect phosphorylation ofTorpedo enzyme. We first hypothesized that phosphorylation inhibition came from one of the residues that differs between the two enzymes. Several mutations were chosen on residues lining the active site gorge in order to mimic the Torpedo enzyme: E107Y (Y70); R108V (V71); Y109D (D72); Y111Q (Q74); V356D (D276); L366F (F288); Y408F (F330); V356D (D276), and D413G (G335). However, these single mutations did not abolish the effect of Triton X-100, suggesting that either another residue is effective for Triton X-100 inhibition or that the differential behavior of the two enzymes originates from a combination of several mutations. Mutations inside the gorge (G303A, E275G, W309G, W121A, and F368L) did not significantly change the affinity of Triton X-100 (Kt) compared with the wild type, confirming that Triton X-100 does not enter the active site gorge (Table I). Among the mutations located at the rim of the gorge, E107Y and E107W increased the affinity for Triton X-100 10-fold. This suggests that Triton X-100 binds at the entrance of the gorge and that residue Glu-107 forms a major part of this site. Glu-107 has been shown to belong to the peripheral anionic site but is not conserved in the ChE family; at this position, we can find a methionine in Bungarus fasciatus AChE, a tyrosine inTorpedo and human AChEs, or an asparagine in human butyrylcholinesterase. In vitro mutagenesis of AChE from vertebrates has shown that this residue affects the binding of peripheral site ligands propidium, gallanine, and tubocurarine, as well as the binding of bis-quaternary ligands such as decamethonium and BW284C51, which bind at both the active and peripheral sites (6.Barak D.

Some mutations located in the proximity of Glu-107 (W359L, D413G, and R108V; see Fig. 4) also affected the affinity for Triton X-100, but to a lesser extent (Table I). This suggests that other residues in the vicinity of Glu-107 participate in Triton X-100 binding. Among them are Trp-359, Asp-413, and Arg-108. The first, Trp-359, has been shown to be one of the most important residues for the binding of several ligands such as propidium in vertebrate AChE (27.Radic Z. Pickering N.A. Vellom D.C. Camp S. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12074-12084Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 30.Shafferman A. Velan B. Ordentlich A. Kronman C. Grosfeld H. Leitner M. Flashner Y. Cohen S. Barak D.

A. 1992; 89: 10827-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Similarly, this residue is important for propidium binding on DrosophilaAChE; the dissociation constant of propidium (8 nm for the wild type AChE) increases to 12 μm for the W359L mutant. As mutation W359L only slightly affects the binding of Triton X-100, as binding of Triton X-100 and propidium are competitive, and as the two residues, Glu-107 and Trp-359, are close, we can conclude that the two peripheral sites partially overlap. Reduced Triton X-100 had the same affinity as Triton X-100 for the activation site; π interactions between the aromatic moiety of Triton X-100 and an aromatic residue of the active site can thus be ruled out. Mutagenesis of residue Glu-107 suggests that the interaction is mainly hydrophobic according to the hydrophobicity indices of Hopp and Woods (32.Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2905) Google Scholar). Indeed, the replacement of glutamate by a more hydrophobic residue (tyrosine, tryptophan, or leucine) increases the Triton X-100 affinity for the protein, whereas a residue that presents approximately the same hydrophobicity as glutamate, a lysine, does not modify the affinity. This result is tentatively illustrated in Fig.5. Triton X-100 has been made to dock on E107Y mutant because it displayed the highest affinity for Triton X-100 (Table I), and we mimicked the hydrophobic interaction by imposing a distance constraint between the iso-octyl moiety and the aromatic ring for the first minimization; this constraint was removed for the following steps. Does this interaction between Triton X-100 and the enzyme provide information for the interaction of acetylcholine at the peripheral site? Binding of the two molecules is competitive, but this does not necessarily imply they both interact with the same site via the same interaction; it only suggests that the two sites overlap. However, if the two sites are identical, it must be remembered that the ammonium moiety of acetylcholine is buried inside a cloud of methyls and behaves like a positively charged hydrophobic domain as shown by Fraenkelet al. (33.Fraenkel Y. Gershoni J.M. Navon G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), when solving the conformations ofd-tubocurarine, free or bound to a recombinant cholinergic binding site. As a consequence, the attraction of the substrate to the peripheral site can be electrostatic due to the anionic moiety of the glutamate, and binding can be enforced by hydrophobic interactions as for Triton X-100. Triton X-100 binding at the rim of the active site affects the acylation rate constant. Three, not mutually exclusive, interpretations can be proposed. First, Triton X-100 binding at the rim of the gorge modifies the active site conformation as do peripheral site ligands. Berman et al. (34.Berman H.A. Becktel W. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4803-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed conformational changes of AChE following binding of peripheral site ligands by methylphosphono-AChE fluorescence and circular dichroism. Studies with mutated proteins confirmed this hypothesis since binding of ligands to the peripheral site, affects the Trp-84 orientation (6.Barak D. Kronman C. Ordentlich A. Ariel N. Bromberg A. Marcus D. Lazar A. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6296-6305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Ordentlich A. Barak D. Kronman C. Ariel N. Segall Y. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2082-2091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The hypothesis of a conformation change induced by Triton X-100, affecting acylation of the substrate, cannot be rejected or confirmed with the data presented here. In the second hypothesis, Triton X-100 affects enzyme phosphorylation by steric hindrance at the entrance of the active site gorge. This hypothesis appears to have the greatest weight considering the position of the Triton X-100 binding site at the rim of the gorge, and the bulkiness of the Triton X-100 molecule. This explanation has been proposed by Szegletes et al. (37.Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for binding of another inhibitor to the peripheral site. Analysis of the effects of mutations on the c value, which expresses the Triton X-100 effect, corroborates this steric effect hypothesis. Indeed, the E107W mutation narrows the active site gorge and thus increases the effect of Triton X-100 on phosphorylation by malaoxon (c = 0.01). On the other hand, W359L, Y362A, Y111Q, and Y412A enlarge the active site gorge and thus decrease the effect of Triton X-100 on the phosphorylation rate (c > 0.4). A third interpretation involves the role of the peripheral site for substrate hydrolysis, taking into account that Triton X-100 and substrate binding at the peripheral site are competitive. Szegleteset al. (37.Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) assumed that the primary role of the AChE peripheral site is to accelerate the hydrolysis of acetylcholine at low substrate concentrations, so accordingly we can hypothesize that the function of the activation binding site would be to attract the substrate molecule in solution, which would be suitably positioned to reach the catalytic site at the bottom of the gorge. The peripheral site helps direct the substrate to the active site. Inhibition of Triton X-100 at the rim of the gorge would compete with the initial binding of substrate and result in inhibition at low substrate concentration (see Fig. 1). Analysis of the effect of mutations at position 107 on malaoxon phosphorylation is in agreement with this interpretation. Actually, with the four amino acids modified at this position, a correlation exists between Triton X-100 affinity and phosphorylation (Fig. 6). As Triton X-100 affinity represents substrate affinity at the non-productive site and as phosphorylation represents acylation of the substrate, the correlation between substrate affinity and acylation suggests that an increase of affinity for the substrate at the rim of the gorge increases acylation."

Although the diphtheria toxin itself has been well studied at both the genetic and biochemical level, little is known of the molecular mechanisms involved in pathogenesis and infection (3.Greenfield L.

Iron is an essential nutrient required by most bacteria for survival and for their ability to cause disease (7.Braun V. Hantke K. Koster W. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 1998; 35: 67-145PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of extracellular iron available within the host are limited, with most of the free iron being complexed to high affinity binding proteins such as transferrin or intracellularly in the erythrocytes as heme (7.Braun V. Hantke K. Koster W. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 1998; 35: 67-145PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Otto B.R. Verweij-van Vught A.M. MacLaren D.M. Crit. Rev.

To circumvent the low availability of iron, pathogens have developed sophisticated mechanisms to utilize the host's iron- and heme1-containing proteins. A number of Gram-negative pathogens such as Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersiniae enterocolitica have developed iron-dependent outer membrane receptors specific for heme (9.Mills M. Payne S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Stoebner J.A. Payne S.M. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2891-2895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Stojiljkovic I. Hantke K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4359-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Heme is transported through such receptors via a TonB-mediated gated pore mechanism (12.Braun V. FEMS Microbiol.

Once localized in the periplasm, heme is bound to a periplasmic binding protein, which acts as a soluble receptor for the cytoplasmic ATP binding transporter (14.Stojiljkovic I. Hantke K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 719-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It was proposed that these bacteria contained a heme oxygenase activity required for iron release from the heme. However, proteins with a heme degrading activity or sequence homology with known heme oxygenases have not been identified in the Gram-negative pathogens. In contrast, the iron-regulated hmuO gene identified inC. diphtheriae, which is expressed under iron-limiting conditions, showed extensive homology with the human heme oxygenase protein (15.Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported the expression and purification of Hmu O and determined its function to be that of a heme oxygenase (16.Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This is the first report of a heme degrading activity in any bacterial pathogen to date. Heme oxygenase is the rate-limiting enzyme in heme degradation and catalyzes the NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase-dependent cleavage of heme to biliverdin with the release of iron and carbon monoxide (Scheme FS1) (17.Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of Hmu O in C. diphtheriae is to oxidatively cleave the heme macrocycle, releasing the iron for subsequent use by the invading pathogen. In the present paper we describe the characterization of the Hmu O proximal mutant H20A and show that, in contrast to the human heme oxygenase (HO-1), the proximal ligand is not required for the initial hydroxylation reaction in the conversion of heme to α-meso-hydroxyheme by Hmu O. Plasmid purification, subcloning, and bacterial transformations were carried out as described previously (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

The oligonucleotides encoding the mutation were as follows for the sense (5′-ACCGCACAAGCAGCTGAAAAAGCTGAG-3′) and antisense (5′-GGAGTGCTCAGCTTTTTCAGCTGCTTGTGCGGTGGACTG-3′) strands. The polymerase chain reaction reaction was carried out using the following program; 95 °C for 30 s (1 cycle), 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 8 min (16 cycles). The oligonucleotides were designed so as to encode a new restriction site (PvuII) within the gene, which was used to initially screen colonies for positive mutants. Following identification, mutations were verified by DNA sequencing The His-tagged Hmu O proteins (pEHmuO) were expressed and fractionated as described previously (16.Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The soluble fraction was applied directly to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Novagen, Madison, WI) column (1 × 5 ml) previously equilibrated with 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, and 5 mmimidazole. The column was washed with 10 volumes of equilibration buffer, followed by 10 volumes of wash buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, and 60 mmimidazole) and the protein eluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.25 m NaCl, and 500 mm imidazole. The purified protein was exchanged by dialysis into 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5). The heme-Hmu O complexes were prepared as follows. Hemin was added to the purified wt- or H20A-Hmu O to give a final 2:1 heme:protein ratio. The sample was applied to a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.5 × 6.0 cm) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The column was then washed with the same buffer (5 volumes) and the protein eluted in the same buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. The fractions containing the heme-H20A Hmu O complex were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The reduced ferrous CO complex was formed by the addition of dithionite to a carbon monoxide saturated solution of the ferric heme-wt-Hmu O or heme-H20A Hmu O complex. The ferrous CO heme-Hmu O complexes were passed through Sephadex G25 to remove the excess reductant and generate the ferrous oxy-heme-Hmu O complexes (19.Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4487-4491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typical enzyme concentrations for RR experiments were ∼100 μm. Microcon 10 ultrafiltration devices (Amicon) were used for buffer and water exchange. A final enrichement of 80 atom % 18O water (95 atom %, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and 95 atom % D water (99.9 atom %, Aldrich). Reduction to the ferrous state was achieved by adding microliter aliquots of a 10 mm sodium dithionite solution to an argon-purged sample in the Raman capillary cell and was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy in the same cell (20.Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 431-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).12CO (CP grade, Air Products) and 13CO (99%13C, Cambridge Isotope Laboratory) adducts were obtained by injecting CO through a septum-sealed capillary containing argon-purged, reduced enzyme (∼20 μl). The heme-Hmu O-H20A complex was exposed to 50 mm imidazole before reduction to obtain the reconstituted enzyme. RR spectra were obtained using a custom McPherson 2061/207 spectrograph (0.67 m) with a Princeton Instruments (LN-1100PB) liquid N2-cooled CCD detector. Rayleigh scattering was attenuated with Kaiser Optical supernotch filters. Excitation sources consisted of a Coherent Innova 302 krypton laser (413 nm), an Innova 90–6 argon laser (514.5 nm), and a Liconix 4240NB helium/cadmium laser (442 nm). Spectra were collected in a 90° scattering geometry on samples at room temperature with a collection time of a few minutes, whereas longer times and a backscattering geometry were used for low temperature experiments. Frequencies were calibrated relative to indene and CCl4 standards and are accurate to ±1 cm−1. CCl4 was also used to check the polarization conditions. The integrity of the Raman samples, before and after laser illumination, was confirmed by direct monitoring of their UV-visible spectra in the Raman capillaries. The heme-wt-Hmu O or heme-H20A-Hmu O (8 μm) had added to it NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (0.5:1) in a final volume of 1 ml potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The reaction was initiated by the addition of NADPH in 10 μm increments to a final concentration of 100 μm. The spectral changes between the wavelengths 300 and 700 nm were recorded over a period of 30 min. Additional NADPH (100 μm) was added to each of the assays and the reactions incubated for another 10 min at 37 °C, after which the products were extracted for HPLC analysis. The verdoheme product of the heme-H20A Hmu O complex was hydrolytically converted to biliverdin by the method of Saito and Itano (21.Saito S. Itano H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1393-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The resulting biliverdin was extracted into chloroform and reduced to dryness. The residue was resuspended in 5% sulfuric acid in methanol and esterified for 12 h at room temperature (22.O'Carra P. Colleran E. FEBS Lett. 1969; 5: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The esters were diluted (4-fold) with distilled water and extracted into chloroform. The sample was dried over sodium sulfate and the chloroform removed under a stream of argon. The products were analyzed on reverse phase HPLC on a ODS-AQ C18 (S-5μ) (YMC, Inc., Wilmington, NC) column (3.0 × 250 mm) eluted with 85:15 (v/v) methanol:water at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min (23.Crusats J. Suzuki A. Mizutani T. Ogoshi H. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The eluant was monitored at 380 nm and the biliverdin standards eluted in the order α (11.9 min), δ (13.9 min), β (14.8 min), and γ (18.5 min) (23.Crusats J. Suzuki A. Mizutani T. Ogoshi H. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Following reaction of the imidazole reconstituted heme-H20A Hmu O complex with NADPH reductase, glacial acetic acid (100 μl) and 5n HCl (200 μl) were added to the reaction (1 ml) before extracting into chloroform. The organic layer was washed with distilled water (3 × 1 ml) and the chloroform removed under a stream of argon. The biliverdin dimethyl esters were prepared as described above and the products analyzed by HPLC (as above). Purified heme-wt-Hmu O or heme-H20A Hmu O (15 μm), purified NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (1.5 μm), and NADPH (100 μm) in a final volume of 1 ml were placed in both the reference and reaction cuvettes and blanked immediately. The reaction cuvette had added to it 50 μl of myoglobin (125 μm), and the same volume of buffer was added to the reference cuvette. The spectrum was recorded at 2-min intervals between 300 and 600 nm and the transition from 404 to 421 nm monitored. Purification of the H20A-Hmu O protein by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose yielded a protein with a single band at 25 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig.1, inset, lane 1). The amount of protein purified from 2 liters of cells, based on a standard protein assay, was 10 mg. The Soret maximum of the ferric heme-H20A Hmu O complex following the removal of excess heme on Q-Sepharose is at 402 nm (Fig. 1). Reduction of the ferric heme-H20A Hmu O complex with dithionite under an atmosphere of CO gives a spectrum of a reduced ferrous carbon monoxide complex with a Soret band at 412 nm and α/β bands at 568 and 538 nm, respectively (Fig.1). Following passage of the ferrous carbon monoxide complex through Sephadex G-25, the heme-H20A Hmu O complex appeared to rapidly autoxidize back to the ferric resting state (data not shown). Addition of dithionite under anaerobic conditions gives a ferrous deoxy complex with a Soret at 428 nm (Fig. 1). In contrast, the values previously reported for the ferric heme-wt-Hmu O complex are 404 nm, with ferrous CO heme-wt-Hmu O having a Soret maximum at 421 nm with the corresponding α/β bands at 568 and 538 nm (16.Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The high frequency region of the RR spectra of heme-wt-Hmu O obtained with Soret excitation is dependent on temperature and pH (Fig. 2). At room temperature and neutral pH, the core marker bands ν4, ν3, and ν2, at 1372, 1482, and 1563 cm−1, respectively, are characteristic of a hexacoordinate high-spin (6cHS) heme (Fig. 2A). At cryogenic temperatures (Fig. 2 B) or alkaline pH (Fig. 2 C), a partial conversion of the hexacoordinate heme from HS to low spin (LS) configuration is evidenced by ν3, ν2, and ν10, at 1505, 1884, and 1640 cm−1, respectively. These data are consistent with previous UV-visible and RR characterization of wt-Hmu O (16.Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 24.Chu G.C. Tomita T. Sonnichsen F.D. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol.

Solvent-isotope substitutions were performed to assign the spin-state equilibrium to an aqua-hydroxo sixth ligand as in metmyoglobin and in mammalian HO-1. No isotope-sensitive band could be observed at room temperature (data not shown), but at 90 K a band at 551 cm−1 (Fig. 3 A) is downshifted in D2O (Fig. 3 B) and in H218O to 535 (Fig. 3 C) and 530 cm−1, respectively. The frequency, isotope shifts, and temperature dependence of the band at 551 cm−1 are typical of a ν(Fe-OH) of a 6cLS ferric-hydroxo heme complex (26.Asher S.A. Vickery L.E. Schuster T.M. Sauer K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5849-5856Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27.Desbois A. Lutz M. Banerjee R.

The RR data presented above portrays a very similar ferric-heme binding pocket for wt-Hmu O and the mammalian heme oxygenases (31.Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Host J.R. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1010-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M.

Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wild type enzyme, the ferric heme in H20A-Hmu O adopts a penta-coordinate high-spin (5cHS) configuration with ν4, ν3, and ν2, at 1371, 1491, and 1571 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 2 D). As previously observed in proximal mutants of HO-1 (34.Sun J. Loehr T.M. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13734-13740Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 35.Liu Y. Moënne-Loccoz P. Hildebrand D.P. Wilks A. Loehr T.M. Mauk A.G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3733-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the ν4 is unusually low in intensity. In the ferrous state, the wild type enzyme and H20A mutant show high frequency RR spectra characteristic of 5cHS hemes and are capable of binding CO (data not shown). The Fe-CO vibrational modes of the CO complex of reduced wild type and H20A-Hmu O were studied to gain information on the nature of the proximal ligands.12C/13C isotopic substitution allows unambiguous identification of these RR modes (Fig.4). In the wt-Hmu O spectra, the RR band at 500 cm−1 (downshifts 4 cm−1 with13CO) is assigned to the νFe-CO and the weak band at 572 cm−1 (shifts by −15 cm−1 upon13CO substitution) represents the δFe-C-Obending mode (Fig. 4, A and B). The νC-O is observed at 1961 cm−1 with a12C/13C dependence of −45 cm−1(Fig. 4, inset). These frequencies are typical of CO-porphyrins with a neutral histidine as proximal ligand (36.Ray G.B. Li X.-Y. Ibers J.A. Sessler J.L. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 116: 162-176Crossref Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and are very similar to those previously reported by Chu et al.(24.Chu G.C. Tomita T. Sonnichsen F.D. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24490-24496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the heme-H20A Hmu O complex, while comparable δFe-C-O and νC-O are observed, the νFe-CO is observed at 28 cm−1 higher than in the wild type enzyme (Fig. 4, C and D). The frequencies observed in H20A-Hmu O are characteristic of heme-CO complex with a very weak or no proximal ligand (36.Ray G.B. Li X.-Y. Ibers J.A. Sessler J.L. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 116: 162-176Crossref Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The histidine ligation of ferrous heme in wt-Hmu O can be directly probed via its strong Fe-His stretching mode at 222 cm−1(Fig. 5 A). In agreement with the conclusion from the characterization of the heme-CO complex, the frequency of the Fe-His stretch is consistent with a neutral proximal histidine that is only weakly or not hydrogen-bonded as has described previously for myoglobin and mammalian HO-1 (31.Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Host J.R. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1010-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 37.Kitagawa T. Nagai K. Tsubaki M. FEBS Lett. 1979; 104: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 38.Kincaid J. Stein P. Spiro T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). While other vibrations are not significantly changed in the ferrous-heme bound to H20A-Hmu O, the Fe-His stretch is not observed (Fig.4 B), and it is replaced by a new vibration at 228 cm−1 upon addition of imidazole (Fig. 4 C). The 228-cm−1 band is assigned to the ν(Fe-Im) of the 5cHS imidazole complex of H20A-Hmu O. Indeed, the same frequency was observed in the H25A proximal mutant of human HO-1 after reconstitution with imidazole (34.Sun J. Loehr T.M. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13734-13740Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The ferric heme-H20A Hmu O, in contrast to the human H25A HO-1 proximal mutant, is capable of carrying out the initial NADPH dependent hydroxylation of heme to α-meso-hydroxyheme (Scheme FS1, step 1). In the presence of oxygen, the meso-hydroxyheme product is rapidly converted to verdoheme (Scheme FS1, step 2). The heme-H20A Hmu O complex proceeded with the formation of a transient ferrous dioxygen complex with a drop and shift in the Soret band from 402 to 403 nm, an isosbestic point at 425 nm, and the appearance of α/β bands at 574 and 534 nm, respectively (Fig.6 A). The decrease in the α/β bands corresponded to an increase in a band at 612 nm together with a loss of feature in the 650–900 nm region. Bubbling the reaction with CO shifted the Soret to 408 nm and an increase in intensity of the band at 612 nm (data not shown). Addition of pyridine (final concentration of 20%) to this complex gives a spectrum characteristic of a bis-pyridine (Fe2+) verdoheme complex, with a characteristic visible band at 650 nm (data not shown). Extraction of the product in chloroform gives a spectrum typical of the pyridine hemochrome of verdoheme (Fig. 6 B) (39.Lagarias J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 717: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The regiospecificity of the initial hydroxylation was determined following non-enzymatic conversion of the verdoheme product to biliverdin. Verdoheme was converted to biliverdin by hydrolysis in a potassium hydroxide-methanol solution. Biliverdin was esterified and analyzed by HPLC. The resultant HPLC chromatogram for the NADPH dependant reaction gave a major peak with a retention time identical to that of authentic biliverdin IXα with a small amount of the β, δ, and γ isomers (<5%) (data not shown). Difference absorption spectroscopy in the presence of myoglobin was used to determine whether carbon monoxide is generated as a product of oxidative cleavage of the heme by the H20A Hmu O mutant. The myoglobin Soret band was monitored at 1-min intervals, and as for the wild type enzyme (Fig. 7 A), the Soret shifted from 408 nm to 421 nm with the appearance of α/β bands at 568 and 538 nm, respectively (Fig. 7 B). The complete conversion of ferric myoglobin to the ferrous carbon monoxide complex indicated that carbon monoxide was generated in parallel with verdoheme formation (Scheme FS1, step 2). Titration of the heme-H20A Hmu O complex with imidazole (1:2000) shifted the Soret from 402 nm to 404 nm (Fig.8 A). Following addition of NADPH and cytochrome P450 reductase the Soret shifted from 404 nm to 410 nm with the appearance of α/β bands at 580 and 540 nm, respectively. As the reaction proceeded the Soret at 410 nm decreased and shifted back toward 400 nm, which was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the α/β bands and increase in the 680 nm absorbance, indicative of biliverdin formation (Scheme FS1). Acidification and extraction of the product in chloroform gave a spectrum typical of biliverdin IXα (Fig. 8 B). HPLC analysis of the product gave a single peak in the HPLC chromatogram corresponding to biliverdin IXα (data not shown). The titration of the heme-H20A Hmu O complex with imidazole rescues the H20A Hmu O mutant's ability to catalyze the conversion of verdoheme to biliverdin (Scheme FS1, step 3). The electronic absorption and resonance Raman data presented above provide evidence that the heme-Hmu O complex is coordinated by a proximal histidine. The low frequency value of 222 cm−1 is consistent with a neutral imidazole as the proximal ligand and is in close agreement with the value recently reported for the recombinant Hmu O (24.Chu G.C. Tomita T. Sonnichsen F.D. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24490-24496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the mammalian heme oxygenases (29.Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Takeuchi N. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 32.Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The value is also similar to that previously reported for sperm whale myoglobin (221 cm−1), in which the proximal histidine is only weakly hydrogen-bonded (37.Kitagawa T. Nagai K. Tsubaki M. FEBS Lett. 1979; 104: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The ferric heme-Hmu O complex exists as a 6cHS and 6cLS species, with conversion from HS to LS on increasing pH and at cryogenic temperatures. Utilizing isotopic labeling studies, we have demonstrated by RR spectroscopy that the sixth ligand is a hydroxo group as has previously been reported for the mammalian heme oxygenases (29.Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Takeuchi N. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,32.Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The conserved proximal histidine (His-20) in Hmu O corresponding to His-25 in HO-1 and His-45 in HO-2 was confirmed as the proximal ligand by site-directed mutagenesis studies. The electronic absorption spectra of the ferric, ferrous, and ferrous-CO heme-H20A Hmu O complex have Soret maxima at 402, 428, and 414 nm, respectively (Fig. 1). These values are outside the range normally observed for a proximal histidine ligated protein, indicating a change in the heme coordination. The loss of the proximal ligand in the heme-H20A Hmu O complex was confirmed by the disappearance of the 222 cm−1 Fe-His stretching mode in the low frequency region of the RR spectrum. Moreover, the RR characterization of the heme-CO complex in H20A Hmu O clearly demonstrates the absence of any strong proximal ligand. On addition of exogenous imidazole the electronic absorption spectrum of the reconstituted heme-H20A Hmu O complex closely resembles that of the wild type protein (Fig. 6). Coordination of the imidazole was verified by the reappearance of the Fe-N (imidazole) stretching mode in the low frequency Raman (Fig. 5). As previously reported for the human HO-1 H25A proximal mutant, the reappearance of the Fe-N (imidazole) stretching frequency in the H20A Hmu O proximal mutant coincides with the recovery of the catalytic conversion of verdoheme to biliverdin (Scheme FS1) (40.Wilks A. Sun J. Loehr T.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2925-2926Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the absence of exogenous imidazole, the reaction of the heme-H20A Hmu O complex in the presence of NADPH/cytochrome P450 reductase yields a spectrum indicative of a ferrous verdoheme complex, suggested by the band at 650 nm in the electronic absorption spectrum (Fig.6 B), in close agreement with that previously reported for the ferrous verdoheme-CO complex (39.Lagarias J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 717: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, five-coordinate ferric-verdoheme complexes have a band at 690 nm (41.Liu Y. Moënne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6909-6917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The heme-H20A Hmu O reaction, however, terminates at the level of the ferrous-verdoheme complex and does not proceed to the final product biliverdin, as observed in the wild type enzyme. Previous studies on the H63M mutant of cytochrome b5 have shown the protein is capable of carrying out the coupled oxidation of heme (42.Rodriguez J.C. Rivera M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13082-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The reaction was arrested at verdoheme and did not proceed to give biliverdin. The formation of verdoheme rather than biliverdin was proposed to arise from the formation of a six-coordinate His-Met ferrous verdoheme complex. It has previously been shown in coupled oxidation reactions that ligands binding both the fifth and sixth coordination sites with high affinity inhibit the reaction from verdoheme to biliverdin (21.Saito S. Itano H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1393-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This is consistent with inhibition of ferrous-verdoheme conversion to biliverdin by CO, supporting the fact that only five-coordinate verdoheme complexes are capable of undergoing further oxidation to biliverdin (43.Sano S. Sano T. Morishima I. Shiro Y. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is possible that the ferrous verdoheme complex in the H20A-Hmu O mutant is due to bis-coordination, with the sixth ligand coming from a protein-donated residue (histidine or methionine), or from CO released as a consequence of oxidative cleavage. Further studies on the coordination and spin-state of the ferrous verdoheme-H20A Hmu O complex by resonance Raman and MCD are currently under way. The regiospecificity of the initial meso-hydroxylation in the H20A-Hmu O is retained, suggesting the proximal ligand is not essential in orienting the heme for selective hydroxylation of the α-meso-carbon. This is in agreement with the recent three dimensional structure of the human HO-1 in which propionate charge interactions have been identified as being critical in orienting the heme, and specifically the α-meso carbon, for selective hydroxylation (33.Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The apparent differences between the reactivity of the bacterial Hmu O and mammalian heme oxygenases may not be intrinsic to the proximal ligand, but to the protein's ability to bind the heme so as to allow interactions with critical residues or factors on the distal face required for activity. In this respect the proximal His in Hmu O is not essential for binding but may play a role in anchoring the heme in an orientation for optimal reactivity. The subtle difference between the active sites of Hmu O and the mammalian heme oxygenases has been eluded to in recent work, where the distal environment responsible for the acid-base HS to LS has a higher pK a than that previously reported for the mammalian enzymes (25.Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21319-21325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2082740376,"We have recently identified the Xenopus laevis An3 protein as a bona fide substrate for the nuclear export receptor CRM1 (Exportin 1). An3 binds directly to CRM1 with high affinity via a leucine-rich nuclear export signal located in the extreme N terminus. An3 is a member of the DEAD box family of RNA helicases, which unwind RNA duplexes. RNA unwinding is coupled to hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates by the helicase, and the ATPase activity of several helicases is greatly stimulated by various polynucleotides. Here we report that dATP hydrolysis by An3 is stimulated ∼6-fold by total RNA from X. laevis oocytes, whereas poly(U) RNA fails to enhance hydrolysis, suggesting the existence of a specific RNA activator for An3. Kinetic analysis reveals that a mutation within the conserved DEAD box motif reduces the rate of dATP hydrolysis by ∼6-fold. In accordance with this, the DEAD box mutant is unable to unwind double-stranded RNA. Microinjection of the An3 DEAD box mutant into X. laevis oocytes nuclei reveals a significantly lower export rate as compared with wild-type An3 protein. This is not because the mutant has lower affinity toward CRM1, nor is it due to altered RNA binding capacity. This suggests that nuclear export of An3 protein by CRM1 is coupled to An3 helicase activity.

Some of these changes require alteration of RNA conformation. Chaperones have evolved that either stabilize or destabilize RNA structures and RNA-protein interactions, with RNA helicases being a major class of modulators of RNA base pairings and likely also RNA-protein interactions (reviewed in Refs. 1.Fuller-Pace F.V.

RNA helicases contain seven conserved motifs, including the so-called “DEAD box” (from the amino acid sequence Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp). The first two residues of this motif are invariant, while DEAD, DEAH, and DEXH box helicases are categorized in three separate subgroups. The best characterized eukaryotic RNA helicase is the translation initiation factor, eIF-4A,1 which is regarded as a prototype for DEAD box RNA helicases. eIF-4A is thought to play an important role in unwinding RNA secondary structures in mRNA, thereby promoting binding of the small ribosomal subunit (3.Gray N.K. Wickens M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 399-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar).

Thus, although twoEscherichia coli RNA helicases have been reported to disrupt RNA base pairing in the absence of nucleoside triphosphates (17.Jones P.G. Mitta M. Kim Y. Jiang W. Inouye M. Proc.

An3 is expressed throughout oogenesis and embryogenesis (28.Rebagliati M.R. Weeks D.L. Harvey R.P. Melton D.A.

Nature. 1991; 349: 717-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). During the early stages of oogenesis An3 protein is found in both the nucleoli and the cytoplasm, whereas no signal is detected in the nucleus of stage VI oocytes (29.Gururajan R. Mathews L. Longo F.J. Weeks D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31.Longo F.J. Mathews L. Gururajan R. Chen J. Weeks D.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 45: 491-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In early embryos An3 protein is still excluded from the nucleus but is later found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (31.Longo F.J. Mathews L. Gururajan R. Chen J. Weeks D.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 45: 491-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The central part of the 697-amino acid sequence of An3 contains all the seven characteristically motifs of DEAD box RNA helicases and, furthermore, recombinant An3 protein has been shown to posses ATPase and RNA helicase activity (7.Gururajan R. Weeks D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Proteins highly related to An3 have been cloned from human (32.Lahn B.T. Page D.C. Science. 1997; 278: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), mouse (33.Leroy P. Alzari P. Sassoon D. Wolgemuth D. Fellous M.

Microbiol. 1991; 5: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), andSchizosaccharomyces pombe (GenBank accession numberAF084222), suggesting that the biological function of An3 is evolutionarily conserved. Since the mouse PL10 gene was the first to be identified we will refer collectively to the aforementioned proteins as members of the “PL10 family.” Through biochemical and genetic analyses Chuang and co-workers (38.Chuang R.Y. Weaver P.L. Liu Z. Chang T.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1468-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) showed that the S. cerevisiae Ded1p is required for translation in vivoand in vitro (38.Chuang R.Y. Weaver P.L. Liu Z. Chang T.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1468-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The related human DBX and mouse PL10 proteins each can rescue the growth of yeast cells with aded1 deletion (38.Chuang R.Y. Weaver P.L. Liu Z. Chang T.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1468-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 39.Mamiya N. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15751-15756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and it therefore seems plausible that all proteins in the PL10 family are involved in protein synthesis. However, other aspects of gene expression might be regulated by these proteins. In agreement with the immunolocalization experiments showing that An3 is a partly nuclear protein (29.Gururajan R. Mathews L. Longo F.J. Weeks D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31.Longo F.J. Mathews L. Gururajan R. Chen J. Weeks D.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 45: 491-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have recently shown that the An3 protein shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (40.Askjaer P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Bischoff R. Weeks D. Ogniewski V. Ohno M. Niehrs C. Kjems J. Mattaj I.W. Fornerod M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6276-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Nuclear export is mediated by direct binding to the transport receptor CRM1 (41.Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar) via an N-terminal leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) and, interestingly, an alignment of the PL10 family reveals that the NES sequence is conserved in all members. This suggests that PL10-like proteins may also have a nuclear function distinct from translation. Transport of proteins and protein-RNA complexes across the nuclear envelope is an active and highly regulated process, which involves numerous factors (reviewed by Ref. 42.Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The translocations take place through large nuclear pore complexes that consist of 50–100 distinct proteins, the nucleoporins (43.Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Trafficking of cargo through the nuclear pore complexes is mediated by soluble transport receptors, that interact with the nucleoporins. The transport receptors are capable of binding directly to their cargo or, alternatively, via adapters. Formation of export complexes containing CRM1-like transport receptors in the nucleus requires the GTPase Ran. Because of an asymmetric distribution of proteins that regulate the nucleotide bound state of Ran, Ran is predominantly GTP-bound in the nucleus and in the GDP form in the cytoplasm. Since only RanGTP, but not RanGDP, supports formation of a stable heteromeric export complex, the gradients of GDP- and GTP-bound Ran across the nuclear envelope are essential for export of multiple cargoes from the nucleus. Conversely, nuclear import complexes consisting of importin β-like proteins are only stable in the absence of RanGTP, i.e. in the cytoplasm. Hence, Ran is a key player in defining directionality in nucleocytoplasmic transport (42.Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). In this report we show that the ATPase and helicase activities of An3 are coupled to nuclear export. An amino acid substitution within the characteristic DEAD box motif of An3 not only inhibits ATP hydrolysis and RNA unwinding activities in vitro but also diminishes nuclear export of An3 protein in X. laevis oocytes. We demonstrate that the mutant protein is capable of forming a heterotrimeric complex consisting of An3, CRM1, and RanGTP with the same efficiency as the wild-type protein. This excludes the possibility that the mutation leads to an aberrant protein conformation in which the NES of An3 is inaccessible. The plasmid pGEX-GTH-An3 for expression of An3 fused to the C terminus of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) was constructed by inserting a blunt-end PCR fragments into the SmaI site of pGEX-GTH (44.Jensen T.H. Jensen A. Kjems J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The PCR reaction was performed with PfuI polymerase (Stratagene), primers 5′-CCGTTGCCCCACCAGTCAACC and 5′-GATGAGTCATGTGGCCGTGGAAAATG, and pET21a-An3 (40.Askjaer P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Bischoff R. Weeks D. Ogniewski V. Ohno M. Niehrs C. Kjems J. Mattaj I.W. Fornerod M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6276-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) as template. The fusion protein encoded by this plasmid also contains a recognition sequence for the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent heart muscle kinase at the C terminus and a thrombin cleavage site between the GST and An3 sequences. pGEX-GTH without insert was used for synthesis of GST protein. pGEX-GTH-An3 E389Q, which encodes an An3 fusion protein with an amino acid substitution at position 389 in An3 (a Glu to Gln substitution), was constructed by whole plasmid PCR usingTaqPlus polymerase (Stratagene), primers 5′-ATCTAGTACCAAATACTTGC and 5′-CAAGCAGACAGAATGCTTGAG and pGEX-GTH-An3 as template. The ends of the resulting ∼7-kilobase PCR fragment were subsequently made blunt, phosphorylated, and finally ligated together. pET21a-An3 E389Q was made using the same strategy as for pGEX-GTH-An3 E389Q with pET21a-An3 as template. Similarly, pET21a-An3 L19A/L21A was constructed using primers 5′-ATGCGAACTCAGCCGATGCTGAAAG and 5′-CTGCGCCAGCAAACTGCTGGTC and pET21a-An3 as template. This resulted in substitution of An3 amino acids Leu19 and Leu21 with alanines. The triple mutant pET21a-An3 L19A/L21A/E389Q was cloned using the same primers with pET21a-An3 E389Q as template. The plasmids pBS(+)ΔEcoXma and pBS(+)ΔXbaSph were made by digestion of pBS(+) with EcoRII + XmaI andXbaI + SphI, respectively, followed by Klenow fill-in in the presence of dNTP and religation of the plasmids. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The plasmids pQE-32-Ran, pQE-60-Rna1p, pQE-60-zzRBP1, which were a gift from Dr. Dirk Görlich, and pET-His-CRM1-H are described elsewhere (45.Askjaer P.

Cell. 1994; 79: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). These plasmids encode His-tagged Ran, Rna1p, RanBP1ΔNES (referred to as RanBP1 in the following), and CRM1, respectively. GST-An3 and GST-An3 E389Q proteins were prepared in parallel from E. coli strain BL21. 1.5 liters of bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C untilA 600 reached ∼1, transferred to room temperature, and induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Bacteria were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in 60 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.9, 200 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), containing proteinase inhibitors. The suspensions were gently sonicated followed by addition of Triton X-100 to 1% and agitation for 30 min at 4 °C. The suspensions were cleared by centrifugation and the supernatants were mixed with 600 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proteins were allowed to bind to the matrix for 45 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The matrix was washed extensively with buffer A and bound proteins were eluted with reduced glutathione (100 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 20 mmglutathione). Eluates were dialyzed against PBS containing 9% (v/v) glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol and purified further on a SP-Sepharose column using fast protein liquid chromatography equipment (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and PBS as running buffer. In a linear NaCl gradient proteins eluted at 100 mm NaCl, giving a total NaCl concentration of ∼220 mm. Eluates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) revealing that the GST-An3 and GST-An3 E389Q preparations were devoid of contaminants detectable at the level of Coomassie staining. Glycerol and dithiothreitol was added to the eluates at final concentrations of 9% and 1 mm, respectively, and eluates were stored at −80 °C. GST protein was expressed from pGEX-GTH in E. coli BL21 according to standard procedures (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression and preparation of CRM1, GTP-bound Ran, Rna1p, and RanBP1 has been described previously (45.Askjaer P. Jensen T.H. Nilsson J. Englmeier L. Kjems J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33414-33422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Strand 1 and 2 RNAs were produced by standard run-off transcription using HindIII linearized pBS(+)ΔEcoXma in combination with T7 RNA polymerase andEcoRI linearized pBS(+)ΔXbaSph in combination with T3 RNA polymerase, respectively. For synthesis of randomly radiolabeled RNA [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 800 Ci/mmol) was included in the reaction mixture. All RNAs were gel purified and quantified by the specific activity of 32P incorporation or by UV absorption at 260 nm. Total RNA from X. laevis oocytes was prepared by incubating 100 oocytes in 5 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.5% (w/v) SDS, 1.5 mg/ml Proteinase K) for 3 h at 37 °C with vigorous shaking followed by phenol extraction twice and ethanol precipitation. 3′-end labeling of totalX. laevis RNA was done using [α-32P]pCp prepared according to standard protocols and RNA ligase. Poly(U) RNA was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Reactions containing 0.6–2.9 pmol (60–290 ng) of GST-An3 or GST-An3 E389Q in 5 μl of An3 storage buffer (220 mm NaCl, 3 mmKH2PO4, 5 mmNa2HPO4, 9% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.3) was mixed on ice with 670 μmMgCl2, 0–1.7 μg/μl RNA, and 5–625 μmunlabeled dATP (all final concentrations) in a total volume of 15 μl. In competition experiments various unlabeled nucleoside triphosphates were added to final concentrations of 800 μm on a background of 80 μm dATP. In all experiments 0.1 μl of [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 750 Ci/mmol) was included. Following incubation at 37 °C for 10–90 min the reactions were stopped by placing the tubes on ice and adding 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. 3.5 μl of the reactions were spotted on PEI cellulose F thin layer chromatography plates (E. Merck). The plates were air dried shortly, pre-wetted with ethanol, and developed in 0.5m KH2PO4. Finally, the plates were dried and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Per reaction approximately 800 fmol of cold strand 1 RNA and 25 fmol of radiolabeled strand 2 RNA was renatured in 10 μl of renaturation buffer (10 mmHEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl) by heating to 95 °C followed by slow cooling to 37 °C and then placed on ice. To the renatured RNA the following was added: 2 μl of unwinding buffer (400 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 500 mmCH3COOK, 30 mm(CH3COO)2Mg, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 5 μl of An3 storage buffer with or without ∼2 pmol (200 ng) of GST-An3 or GST-An3 E389Q, and either 1 μl of 30 mm ATP or 1 μl of H2O. Reactions were placed at 30 °C for 30 min after which 15 μl of stop buffer (20 mm EDTA, 9% (v/v) glycerol, 0.4% (w/v) SDS, 0.1 mg/ml Proteinase K, bromphenol blue) were added and incubation continued at 30 °C for 5 min. 20 μl of the reactions were loaded on a pre-run nondenaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 100 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 1 mm EDTA. The gels were run at 10 mA at room temperature followed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis. 35S-Labeled wild-type and mutant An3 proteins were synthesized from the pET21a-An3 plasmid and derivatives hereof by coupled in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate according to the manufacturer (Promega). GST protein produced from the pGEX-GTH plasmid was labeled with 35S as described previously (40.Askjaer P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Bischoff R. Weeks D. Ogniewski V. Ohno M. Niehrs C. Kjems J. Mattaj I.W. Fornerod M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6276-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Buffer exchange of An3 and GST proteins to PBS containing 9% (v/v) glycerol was performed using Nanosep concentrators (Palfiltron). 18 nl of a mixture of An3 and GST proteins were microinjected into the nuclei of X. laevisstage VI oocytes incubated in modified Barths' saline (15 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.6, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 0.30 mmCaNO3, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 MgSO4, 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate). Upon incubation for 0–100 min at 18 °C injected oocytes were manually dissected in J buffer (10 mmHEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 70 mm NH4Cl, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and cytoplasms and nuclei were transferred immediately to TNE (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and 96% ethanol, respectively. The fractions of seven oocytes per sample were pooled. Cytoplasmic fractions were homogenized in 250 μl of TNE by repeated pipetting and cleared by centrifugation.

Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in 49 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer by vigorous shaking for 15 min and repeated pipetting. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min and 11 μl were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gels were fixed, equilibrated in Amplify solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and subjected to autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis. 18 pmol (1.8 μg) of GST-An3 or GST-An3 E389Q or 90 pmol (2.5 μg) of GST was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B and mixed with 5 μl of CRM1 buffer (45.Askjaer P.

Alternatively, complexes were dissolved by addition of 5 pmol (200 ng) of RanBP1 and 5 pmol (225 ng) of Rna1p and incubation at room temperature for 15 min. Released proteins were collected and columns were washed with washing buffer. Proteins remaining on the column were recovered by incubation in SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 37 °C for 10 min. All samples were adjusted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were visualized by silver staining.

This suggested that An3 has a nuclear function and in order to test this hypothesis we decided to investigate if a connection exists between An3 helicase function and nuclear export mediated by CRM1. Furthermore, we wished to extend the characterization of the enzymatic activities of recombinant An3. We expressed and purified full-length An3 protein fused to the C terminus of GST using glutathione-Sepharose and cation exchange chromatography.

The immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 profoundly inhibit the calcium-dependent signaling pathway in T lymphocytes by interfering with the activity of the calcium/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin (CN). Little is known, however, about how activation of CN enzyme activity or interaction with its substrate, nuclear factor of activated T cell (NF-AT), is regulated. We show here that the binding of CaM to CN may affect the conformation of CN at both the CaM-binding and the autoinhibitory (AI) domains and that this is critical for activation of CN to dephosphorylate NF-AT. Dissociation of the AI domain from the enzyme active site on CN leads to expose a binding site for NF-AT at the N terminus of CN and allows the CN binding to NF-AT. Since the cytoplasmic form of NF-AT can interact with CN mutants lacking enzyme activity, the interaction of the two molecules is independent of CN enzyme activity and occurs prior to the dephosphorylation of NF-AT. Dephosphorylation converts NF-AT from the cytoplasmic to the nuclear form by exposing the DNA-binding domain on NF-AT, and the nuclear form of NF-AT brings CN together into the nuclei. We therefore propose that the activation of CN by the CaM binding independently regulates the interaction with NF-AT and the dephosphorylation of NF-AT.

The function of CN in T cells has been identified as a common target for two immunosuppressive drugs, cyclosporin A and FK506 (3.Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I.

The cyclophilin-cyclosporin A and FKBP-FK506 complexes independently associate with calcineurin and inhibit its protein phosphatase activity. CN is a member of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase family. Unlike other members, however, the activation of CN is totally dependent on the elevation of intracellular calcium concentrations (5.Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev.

This phosphatase is a heterodimeric complex composed of a catalytic subunit (CN-A) and a calcium-binding regulatory subunit (CN-B) (6.Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol.

The A subunit contains several distinct functional regions, including a catalytic domain (encoding amino acids 1–323), a B-subunit binding region (encoding amino acids 324–369), a CaM-binding domain (encoding amino acids 391–414), and an autoinhibitory (AI) domain (encoding amino acids 467–521) (6.Klee C.B.

The TCR signal elevates the intracellular calcium concentration, leading to the activation of CaM, which interacts with the CaM-binding domain of the CN-A subunit. The binding of activated CaM may regulate the initiation of phosphatase activity through a conformational change at the AI domain (6.Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol.

Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar).

Four independent NF-AT genes, NF-AT1 (NF-ATp, NF-ATc2), NF-AT2 (NF-ATc, NF-ATc1), NF-AT3 (NF-ATc4), and NF-AT4 (NF-ATc3) have been identified, and recent studies have illustrated that each member of this family has a distinct physiological role (16.McCaffrey P.G.

All molecules have the ability to transactivate the promoter containing the recognition site for NF-AT. The NF-AT molecules show striking sequence homology in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) containing the region responsible for nuclear transport and moderate sequence homology in the region NH2-terminal of DBD (20.Crabtree G.R.

This region is responsible for the interaction with CN and the masking of the nuclear localization signal.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18325-18331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Previous studies have also provided evidence that CN plays an important role in the central nervous system. For example, it has been demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing the active form of CN show a suppression of the intermediate phase of long term potentiation (36.Winder, D. G., Mansuy, I. M., Osman, M., Moallem, T. M., and Kandel, E. R. (1998) 92, 25–37Google Scholar).Although the function of NF-AT has been well characterized, how NF-AT activity is regulated by the interaction with CN, and even how CN phosphatase activity itself is regulated still remain obscure. Thus, we assessed the role of the functional domains in CN-A subunit using a series of truncation derivatives. Truncation of the COOH-terminal region containing both the CaM-binding and the AI domains (CNΔCaM-AI) conferred constitutive phosphatase activity. Truncation mutant experiments clearly indicated that the deletion of the AI domain was sufficient for the interaction with NF-AT but not for activation of CN. The additional deletion at the CaM-binding domain was required for activation of CN to dephosphorylate NF-AT. We further discuss the activation process of CN and the interaction with NF-AT that alters the intracellular distribution of CN.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we provide evidence that the binding of CaM to CN may affect the conformation of CN at both the CaM-binding and AI domains and that this process is critical for the induction of their phosphatase activities. The interaction between CN and NF-AT, however, occurs independently of the CN enzyme activity. The dissociation of the AI domain from the enzyme active site by the binding of CaM was sufficient for the enhancement of accessibility to NF-AT. Since mutant CN lacking the enzyme active site can associate with the cytoplasmic form of NF-AT, the association may occur prior to the process of dephosphorylation of NF-AT. After interaction with NF-AT, CN dephosphorylates NF-AT to alter its conformation from the cytoplasmic subunit to the nuclear form. The activated NF-AT plays an important role in the recruitment of CN associating with NF-AT into the nucleus.Previous reports showed that synthetic peptides encoding the AI domain have the ability to neutralize CN enzyme activity in vitro(10.Hashimoto Y. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has been hypothesized that the constitutive activity in the truncation mutant, CNΔCaM-AI, was a consequence of the lack of the AI domain, which masks the enzyme active site (15.Fruman D.A. Pai S.Y. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3857-3863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the deletion mutant experiments described in the present study provided evidence that the deletion of the AI domain was insufficient for the constitutive phosphatase activity and that further deletion of the CaM-binding domain was required. We speculate that, in the wild-type CN, the binding of activated CaM may cause a conformational change at both the CaM-binding and AI domains and generated a similar situation to that of the active form of CN. This possibility was supported by recent crystal structure analysis of the native CN molecule showing that the structure of the COOH-terminal side from the CaM-binding domain was not visible (38.Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E. Sintchak M.D. Thomson J.A. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A. Caron P.R. Hsiao K. Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 39.Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish V.J. Tucker K.D.

Thus, it is likely that the COOH-terminal side from the CaM-binding domain may be structurally unstable.We showed that the binding site for NF-AT was blocked in wild-type CN, while the site was exposed in mutant CN lacking the AI domain. Recent crystal structure analysis has provided direct evidence that the polypeptide encoding the AI domain had the ability to directly interact with the enzyme active site (39.Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish V.J. Tucker K.D. Showalter R.E. Moomaw E.W. Gastinel L.N. Habuka N. Chen X. Maldonado F. Barker J.E. Bacquet R. Villafranca J.E. Nature. 1995; 378: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that occupation of the active site by the AI domain may create a loop structure (AI loop) that blocks the binding of NF-AT. The binding of the calcium-activated CaM may introduce a conformational change at the AI domain, which in turn releases the loop structure by the displacement of the AI domain from the active site. Since the release of the AI loop was essential for the binding of NF-AT, the displacement of the AI domain is a pivotal step in the interaction between NF-AT and CN.Recently, two binding sites for CN on NF-AT1 have been identified besides the serine-rich and putative NLS masking domains. The first was independent of CN phosphatase activity (40.Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), while the second required the presence of phosphatase activity (41.Garcia-Cozar F.J. Okamura H. Aramburu J.F. Shaw K.T.Y. Pelletier L. Showalter R. Villafranca E. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23877-23883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). NF-AT4, however, showed independence of the phosphatase activity in its interaction with CN, and its binding site on NF-AT4 was at residues 104–114 (27.Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J.C. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with the latter observation, because the truncation mutant of CN lacking the enzyme active site could interact with NF-AT1. Although the conformational change of the AI domain by the binding of calcium-activated CaM may be crucial to release the masking of the NF-AT1 binding site, phosphatase activity is not essential for the interaction between NF-AT1 and CN. Thus, the cytoplasmic form of NF-AT1 can interact with the CN that is activated by the binding of CaM.We identified the N-terminal 13 amino acids of the CN molecule as a region that interacts with NF-AT. However, the 13 residues are unique for the α-isoform of the CN A-subunit used in our study, while the NH2 terminus in other isoforms, β and γ, has a completely distinct amino acid sequence (42.Giri P.R. Higuchi S. Kincaid R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 43.Muramatsu T. Giri P.R. Higuchi S. Kincaid R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, our results raise questions about whether different isoforms of CN can interact with NF-AT in different ways or whether each isoform interacts with distinct NF-AT family molecules. It also remains to be determined whether the dephosphorylation process of NF-AT is important for the interaction in CN-A β or γ molecules. Further investigation of the interaction between CN-A β or γ and NF-AT1 may provide a clearer answer to these questions. Moreover, the binding site for NF-AT1 on CN differs from that for of AKAP79, which has been identified at residues 30–98 and 311–336 of the CN-A (44.Kashishian A. Howard M. Loh C. Gallatin W.M. Hoekstra M.F. Lai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (22749): 27412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), implying that CN may interact with different substrates by different binding mechanisms.It has been reported that nuclear transport of the activated-CN occurred concomitantly with the nuclear translocation of NF-AT (27.Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J.C. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar,28.Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the nuclear transport of active CN is strictly dependent on the presence of NF-AT. Dephosphorylation by CN is known to lead to a conformational change of NF-AT that releases the masking of the NLS region, which converts the cytoplasmic form of NF-AT into the nuclear form (1.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 20.Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The truncated mutant of NF-AT that lacks the NH2-terminal side automatically localizes in the nucleus independently of the dephosphorylation by CN, suggesting that the NH2-terminal half of NF-AT plays a role in keeping NF-AT in the cytoplasm. This is consistent with previous reports that a NF-AT4 mutant with deletion of a NLS masking region constantly migrated into the nucleus without the addition of calcium activation (27.Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J.C. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Since the localization of NF-AT influences the distribution of CN, it can be reasonably assumed that dephosphorylated NF-AT has a role in the recruitment of CN into the nucleus. Recently, Zhu and McKeon (45.Zhu J. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the nuclear export signal on the NH2-terminal side of NF-AT4 regulates the export of NF-AT4. They found that the nuclear export of NF-AT4 is mediated by Crm 1 and that the transfected constitutively active form of CN antagonizes the Crm 1-mediated nuclear export of NF-AT4 (45.Zhu J. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This suggests that the recruitment of the active form of CN by NF-AT is required for sustaining a transcriptional activity of NF-AT in the nucleus. We speculated that Crm 1 also shares the same binding motif to interact with NF-AT, but this may not be the case. Crm 1 does not contain the sequence corresponding to the 13 residues that we identified in the interaction between CN-Aα and NF-AT1Finally, a summary of our model is provided in Fig.5. In the resting stage of T cells, CN is negatively regulated by the AI domain through the interference of its active site. The AI domain regulates NF-AT binding by masking the NF-AT binding site through formation of AI loop, while the CaM-binding and AI domains synergistically regulate the phosphatase activity of CN. As a consequence of the TCR-mediated elevation of the intracellular calcium concentration, activated CaM binds to CN and then cancels the negative regulation by AI. The binding of CaM may alter the conformation at both the CaM-binding and AI domains on CN, leading to activation of CN. Upon dephosphorylation, NF-AT is converted from the cytoplasmic to the nuclear form by a releasing the masking its NLS region. The nuclear form of NF-AT associated with CN translocates into the nucleus and remains until it is exported from the nucleus. CN1 (also known as PP2B), a calcium- and CaM-dependent protein serine/threonine phosphatase, plays an important role in T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated signal transduction, leading to the transcriptional activation of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, interferon-γ, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (1.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 2.Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The function of CN in T cells has been identified as a common target for two immunosuppressive drugs, cyclosporin A and FK506 (3.Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar, 4.Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 696: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The cyclophilin-cyclosporin A and FKBP-FK506 complexes independently associate with calcineurin and inhibit its protein phosphatase activity. CN is a member of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase family. Unlike other members, however, the activation of CN is totally dependent on the elevation of intracellular calcium concentrations (5.Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar,6.Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). This phosphatase is a heterodimeric complex composed of a catalytic subunit (CN-A) and a calcium-binding regulatory subunit (CN-B) (6.Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The A subunit contains several distinct functional regions, including a catalytic domain (encoding amino acids 1–323), a B-subunit binding region (encoding amino acids 324–369), a CaM-binding domain (encoding amino acids 391–414), and an autoinhibitory (AI) domain (encoding amino acids 467–521) (6.Klee C.B.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At low calcium concentrations, the AI domain is thought to block the enzyme active site within the catalytic region, keeping CN inactive (10.Hashimoto Y. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Parsons J.N. Wiederrecht G.J. Salowe S. Burbaum J.J. Rokosz L.L. Kincaid R.L. O'Keefe S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19610-19616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TCR signal elevates the intracellular calcium concentration, leading to the activation of CaM, which interacts with the CaM-binding domain of the CN-A subunit. The binding of activated CaM may regulate the initiation of phosphatase activity through a conformational change at the AI domain (6.Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by the reports showing that a truncated mutant of the A subunit (residues 1–396) (ΔCaM-AI) (12.Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3857-3863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) possessed constitutive activity. The best defined substrate for CN is NF-AT, which is a critical regulator of early gene transcription in the activation process induced by the TCR-mediated signal (2.Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The consensus motif for NF-AT has been identified in the promoter region of multiple cytokine genes, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α (1.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Four independent NF-AT genes, NF-AT1 (NF-ATp, NF-ATc2), NF-AT2 (NF-ATc, NF-ATc1), NF-AT3 (NF-ATc4), and NF-AT4 (NF-ATc3) have been identified, and recent studies have illustrated that each member of this family has a distinct physiological role (16.McCaffrey P.G.

The region of OEP16 directly involved in channel formation has been identified by electrophysiological analysis of a selection of reconstituted OEP16 mutants. Because analysis of these mutants depended on the use of recombinant protein, we evaluated the electrophysiological properties of OEP16 isolated directly from pea chloroplasts and of the recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli. The results show that the basic properties like conductance, selectivity, and open probability of the channel formed by native pea OEP16 are comparable with the channel activity formed by the recombinant source of the protein. Following electrophysiological analysis of OEP16 mutants we found that point mutations and insertion of additional amino acid residues in the region of the putative helix 1 (Glu73 to Val91) did not change the properties of the OEP16 channel. The only exception was a Cys71→Ser mutation, which led to a loss of the CuCl2 sensitivity of the channel. Analysis of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of OEP16 and mutants containing defined shuffled domains indicated that the minimal continuous region of OEP16, which is able to form a channel in liposomes, lies in the first half of the protein between amino acid residues 21 and 93.

Chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis, which converts atmospheric carbon dioxide to carbohydrates like triosephosphate, starch, and others. These and other biosynthetic pathway products and intermediates are steadily exchanged with the surrounding cell by the assistance of specific carrier proteins, localized in the plastidic inner envelope and solute channels located in the chloroplast outer envelope. Although the inner envelope transport proteins, such as the triosephosphate/phosphate translocator, the dicarboxylate translocator, and the hexose phosphate translocator, show distinct substrate selectivity and specificity (1.Flügge U.I. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it is not known to what extent transport through the outer membrane channels is selective and regulated. In particular, the number of different channels present in the outer membrane has not been determined. In mitochondria, a single anion selective channel with high conductance (VDAC)1 has been discovered and extensively characterized at a molecular level (2.Song J.M. Colombini M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A second protein with high homology to the VDAC channel has also been identified (3.Lee A.C. Xu X. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The VDAC channel formed by a 30-kDa protein with presumed β-sheet topology (4.Mannella C.A. Neuwald A.F. Lawrence C.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 163-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is thought to be responsible for most of the metabolite flux across the outer mitochondrial membrane (5.Hodge T. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In Gram-negative bacteria, however, several different types of high conductance channels exist in the outer membrane (6.Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3905-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): (i) So-called porins, forming water-filled pores that allow the downhill diffusion of solutes, provided that the size of the solutes does not exceed the exclusion limit (∼600 Da) of the channel pore, e.g. OmpF (7.Schirmer T. Keller T.A. Wang Y.-F. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Modulation of some of these channels by ATP and other effectors has been reported, which questions their classification as generally open diffusion pores (8.Rudel T. Schmid A. Benz R. Kolb H.A. Lang F. Meyer T.F. Cell. 1996; 85: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9.Samartzidou H. Delcour A.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). (ii) Porin-like channels, e.g.LamB from Escherichia coli carrying specific sites that facilitate selective diffusion processes (10.Keller T.A. Ferenci T. Prilipov A. Rosenbusch J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). (iii) Ligand-gated pores, e.g. E. coli ferric enterobactin channels (FePA) providing energy-dependent uptake of iron into bacteria (11.Jiang X.Q. Payne M.A. Cao Z.H. Foster S.B. Feix J.B. Newton S.C. Klebba P.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ancestral relation between mitochondria and plastids with Gram-negative bacteria (12.Martin W. Muller M. Nature. 1998; 392: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) suggests the presence of multiple channel proteins in the chloroplast outer membrane. In pea chloroplast outer membranes, four channel proteins have been identified and functionally characterized so far. In addition to the preprotein-conducting channel originating from a prokaryotic ancestor (13.Bölter B. Soll J. Schulz A. Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15831-15836Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14.Hinnah, S. C. (1999) Electrophysiological Characterization of the Protein Import Pore Toc75 and Its Predecessor SynToc 75. Ph.D. thesis, Universität OsnabrückGoogle Scholar), three distinct solute channels have been discovered and characterized. They were named according to their location ( o uter e nvelope p rotein) and their molecular weight OEP16, OEP21, and OEP24 (15.Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Proc. Natl.

The channel characteristics of OEP24 closely resemble those described for general diffusion pores (6.Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3905-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although slightly cation-selective, the channel allows the passage of triosephosphates, ATP, PPi, dicarboxylate, and positively or negatively charged amino acids in a reconstituted system (17.Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Grimm R. Hill K. Wagner R. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). OEP24 can functionally replace the yeast mitochondrial VDAC in VDAC-deficient yeast mutants (18.Rohl T. Motzkus M. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). OEP21 has been shown to form an anion channel, which is regulated by ATP and triosephosphates from the intramembrane space (16.Bölter B. Soll J. Hill K. Hemmler R. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5505-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, OEP16 forms a cation-selective high conductance channel with a remarkable permeability for amino acids and amines (15.Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9504-9509Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). OEP16 shows sequence similarities to components of the protein t ranslocase of the i nner m itochondrial membrane, namely Tim17, Tim22, and Tim23 (19.Dekker P.J. Keil P. Rassow J. Maarse A.C.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and to a lesser extent to LivH, an amino acid transporter in E. coli(22.Rassow J. Dekker P.T. van Wilpe S. Meijer M. Soll J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Here we describe the characterization of the OEP16 solute channel using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis followed by electrophysiological characterization of the mutant proteins. Our results show that the region spanning from amino acids 21 to 93 of pea OEP16 is sufficient to form a functional solute channel when reconstituted into liposomes. Outer envelope membranes were isolated from purified pea chloroplasts exactly as described previously (23.Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1991; 1: 149-158Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Lipids were removed from the membranes by extraction with ice-cold dimethylketone (80% v/v) followed by centrifugation. The dimethylketone phase was removed, and precipitated proteins were dissolved in HUME buffer (6 m urea, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA) and applied to a strong anion-exchange matrix (Source 30 Q, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The flow-through fraction, which contained OEP16, was directly applied to a strong cation-exchanger (Mono-S, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in HUME buffer. Proteins were eluted from the column matrix by a linear salt gradient (0–0.5 m NaCl) in HUME buffer. The expression plasmid pETOEP16ΔN which codes for OEP16 with a 20-amino acid N-terminal deletion was generated as follows. The truncated gene product was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using cloned cDNA-encoding OEP16 (peacOEP16pbsc (15.Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9504-9509Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)) as the template, the gene-specific primer GGGGGGCATATGGGCAATCCATTCC, and the universal vector primer TGACCGGCAGCAAAATG. The amplified gene product was ligated into pET21b. The expression plasmid pETOEP16ΔC, which codes for a C-terminal truncation of OEP16, was generated using recombinant PCR (24.Higuchi M. Kinoshita T. Takizawa A. Tsujita Y. Okochi K. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1990; 63: 1916-1920Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25.Waegemann K. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6545-6554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) combined with a two-step cloning strategy. The restriction enzyme site NdeI was introduced into the gene by PCR using the primer GAGTTTGACHTATGCCTCGTAGCA and universal vector primer and peacOEP16pbsc as the template. The resulting DNA fragment was digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI andXhoI and ligated into likewise digested pET21b yielding pETOEP16. The plasmid pETOEP16 was then digested with BamHI and BpuI1021 to remove the 3′ portion of the gene encoding the C terminus of OEP16. DNA overhangs of the linearized plasmid containing the partial OEP16 gene were filled by treatment with Klenow fragment and religated to produce pETOEP16ΔC. We also attempted to assay shorter constructs with longer C-terminal deletions (e.g. deletion of the putative helix 1), but we were not able to obtain recombinant proteins of such short mutants of OEP16 from E. coli. The only cysteine residue in OEP16, located at position 71 in the primary sequence, this residue was changed to a serine by PCR using the T3 primer, GCACCTTCTTTAGAACATCTTCTTCCAG, and the universal primer, CTGAAGAAGATGTCTAAAGAAGGTGC, and peacOEP16pbsc was used as the template. The second PCR reaction was performed using the universal primer as above and TGAGTTTGAACCATGGCTCGTAGCAG. pETOEP16–4β-helix 3 and pETOEP16-helix 3/2/3 were constructed by recombinant PCR as outlined in Fig. 1 using pETOEP16 as the template and T7 promotor or terminator primer in combination with helix 3/1 sense or helix 3/1 antisense primers as outlined in Fig. 1 (helix 3/1 sense primer5′GCTGCAATTGCGACAGCTGCAGAATTCATAAATTACCTTACCGAGAGGATCCGTGGCACCAGGGACTGG3′and helix 3/1 antisense primer5′GAATTCTGCACTGTCGCAATTGCAGCACCTGTAATGGCATCTTTACACATCTTCTTCAGAGATTTCTC3′). The products of both PCR reactions were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, eluted from the gel, and used for a recombinant PCR reaction (Fig. 1). DNA was cloned into pET21b. Clones were checked for PCR-induced errors by nucleotide sequencing. Due to a base misincorporation, OEP16-4β-helix 3 and OEP16-helix 3/2/3 contain an alanine to glycine exchange at position 136. Wild type and mutant forms of OEP16 were heterologously expressed in E. coliBL2(DE3) using the pET-vector system (Novagen, Madison, WI). The insoluble recombinant protein was recovered from inclusion bodies as described previously (15.Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9504-9509Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography as outlined above. The purity of the preparations was determined by silver staining following separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Small unilamellar liposomes were obtained from purified azolectin (Sigma, type IV-S) as described (26.Hinnah S.C. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Purified OEP16 was resuspended in 80 mm Mega-9 (nonanoyl-N-methylglucamide), 6 m urea, 10 mm 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (Mops)/Tris, pH 7.0, mixed with the preformed liposomes, and reconstituted by the dialysis technique (27.Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The lipid-to-protein ratio was adjusted to approximately 0.4–0.6 mg of protein/20 mg of lipid/mL. Planar lipid bilayers were produced using the painting technique (28.Mueller P. Rudin D. Tien R. Westcott W.C. Circ. Res. 1962; 26: 1167-1171Crossref Google Scholar). A solution of 50 mg/mLl-α-azolectin in n-decan was applied to a hole (100- to 200-μm diameter) in a Teflon septum, which separated two bath chambers (total volume ∼3 mL each) that were equipped with magnetic stirrers. The resulting bilayers had a typical capacitance of ∼0.5 μF/cm2 and a resistance of >100 GΩ. The noise was about 1 pA (rms) at 5-kHz bandwidth. After a stable bilayer was formed in symmetrical solutions of 20 mm KCl, 10 mm Mops/Tris, pH 7.0, the solution of the cischamber was changed to asymmetrical concentrations (cischamber: 250 mm KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Mops/Tris, pH 7.0). The liposomes were added to thecis compartment directly below the bilayer through the tip of a micropipette to allow the flow of the liposomes across the bilayer. If necessary, the solution in the cis chamber was stirred to promote fusion. After fusion, the electrolytes were changed to the final composition by perfusion. The Ag/AgCl electrodes were connected to the chambers through 2 m KCl-agar bridges. The electrode of the trans compartment was directly connected to the headstage of a current amplifier (EPC 7, List Medical). Reported membrane potentials refer to the trans compartment. The amplified currents were digitized at a sampling interval of 0.2 ms and fed into a Digidata1200 analog to digital converter (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and then stored on the hard disc of an IBM-compatible PC. For analysis, Windows-based analysis software (single channel investigation program (SCIP)) developed in our laboratory was used in combination with Origin 5.0 (Microcal Software Inc.). OEP16 from pea chloroplast envelope membranes (pea-OEP16) was purified in denatured form (see “Experimental Procedures”). The precipitated proteins of the chloroplast outer membrane were dissolved in 6 m urea, 20 mm Hepes/KOH buffer (pH 7.6) and applied to a strong anion-exchange matrix. The flow-through fraction was then directly applied to a strong cation exchanger (Fig.2, A and B). Proteins were eluted from the cation-exchange matrix by a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m NaCl). OEP16 eluted at approximately 100 mm NaCl (Fig. 2 B) and was essentially pure as determined by silver staining following separation by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 C). OEP16 purified from pea chloroplasts as well as wild type and mutant OEP16 isolated from E. coli were reconstituted using a modified dialysis technique as described in detail elsewhere (15.Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9504-9509Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The refolding of the denatured proteins was achieved by dilution of the protein into a lipid/detergent mixture with subsequent removal of the detergent by dialysis. Typically, 1–10% of the proteins were restored to a functional state (15.Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9504-9509Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17.Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Grimm R. Hill K. Wagner R.

Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In order to confirm that purified wild type pea OEP16 expressed in E. coli retains similar functional properties to OEP16 isolated from its natural source, the outer envelope of pea chloroplast, we investigated the basic channel properties of both proteins. After reconstitution of purified native pea OEP16 (pea-OEP16) into liposomes and fusion of the resulting proteoliposomes with planar lipid bilayers, single channel currents could be observed at positive and negative membrane potentials (Fig.3 A). The current voltage relation of the open single channel conductance was linear (Fig.3 C) with a slope conductance of Λ = 220 ± 8 pS in asymmetrical buffer of 250 mm/20 mm KCl. The reversal potential of the pea-OEP16 channel at this 12.5:1 concentration gradient of KCl was E rev = +47 mV (Fig. 3 B, EK+ = +64 mV, ECl− = −64 mV). Conversion of this value by the constant field approach (Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation) yielded a permeability ratio of PK+/P Cl−≅ 13:1. This value stands in good agreement with the value for the recombinant protein (E rev = +48 mV (29.Steinkamp, T. (2000) The Electrophysiological Characterisation of OEP16, a Pore-forming Protein of the Outer Chloroplastic membrane. Ph.D. thesis, Universität OsnabrückGoogle Scholar)) and the conductance is in the same order of magnitude as that of the recombinant OEP16 channel (250 ± 30 pS in 250 mm/20 mm KCl (29.Steinkamp, T. (2000) The Electrophysiological Characterisation of OEP16, a Pore-forming Protein of the Outer Chloroplastic membrane. Ph.D. thesis, Universität OsnabrückGoogle Scholar)). In addition, the overall open probability of the pea-OEP16 channel at different membrane voltages corresponds well with the value determined for the recombinant protein (15.Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9504-9509Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) as pea-OEP16 channels likewise started to close at membrane potentials above 80 mV (Fig. 3 B). CuCl2, which has been shown to cross-link two cysteines in the oligomeric wtOEP16 (15.Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9504-9509Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and to block the current through wtOEP16 (see Fig. 4 A), also closed most of the pea-OEP16 channels in a bilayer. About 94% of the current was blocked (Fig. 3 D). These results show that the basic channel properties of the purified pea-OEP16 and those of the recombinant wtOEP16 are very similar. This demonstrates that the reconstitution of the recombinant protein is a suitable approach to examine the principle functional properties of these membrane solute channels. The diagram in Fig. 1 D illustrates the different block mutations introduced into the primary sequence of OEP16, whereas the point mutations are listed in Table I. In the following we describe the basic channel properties of these mutant proteins after purification and reconstitution. Tables I andII summarize the effects the different mutations in the primary sequence of OEP16 have on its channel properties.Table IEffect of point mutations on the OEP16 channel activityNo.MutationsChange in conductanceChange in selectivityChange in CuCl2 block1+Ala75—aUnchanged.——2+Gly83———3Gly78→Trp———4Val84→Ala———5Glu88→Lys———6Trp97→Ala———7Cys77→Ser——++bConsiderably changed.a Unchanged.b Considerably changed.

Open table in a new tab As shown in Table I, the only observed change in the basic channel properties of OEP16 was the loss of the CuCl2 sensitivity caused by the Cys71→Ser mutation. A typical measurement of a bilayer containing eight open Cys71→Ser mutant channels before and after addition of CuCl2 (Fig. 4) demonstrates that CuCl2 had no effect on the open channels, thus indicating that Cys71 is directly involved in the CuCl2 block. We introduced deletions from Met1→Met21 (ΔN mutant) and from Ile94→Ile146 (ΔC mutant) in the primary sequence of OEP16 (see Fig. 1 D). The recombinant mutant proteins were reconstituted, and their channel properties were investigated. As observed for the point mutations, no significant changes in the basic channel properties of the two deletion mutants were detected (Table II). This is shown in Fig.5 A in a typical current recording from a bilayer containing six ΔC mutant protein channels. As observed for the wild type recombinant protein, the channels started to close when a holding potential of V h = +175 mV was applied. The slope conductance of the ΔC mutant channel obtained from Fig. 5 B (Λ = 315 ± 25 pS in symmetrical 250 mm KCl) was close to that of the wild type protein (Λ = 330 ± 30 pS) under identical ionic conditions. Therefore, the common sequence motif from amino acids 21 through 93 of OEP16 is responsible for the formation of the solute channel. In order to determine which regions of OEP16 are directly involved in the formation of the OEP16 channel we constructed mutant proteins in which the location of complete sequence blocks was changed. First, putative helix 3 (amino acids 128–146; see Fig. 1 D) was inserted into position of amino acids 73–91, thus substituting putative helix 1 (amino acids 73–91) (see Fig. 1 B). This mutant protein is referred to as OEP16-helix 3/2/3. Second, we constructed a deletion mutant in which putative helix 1 was substituted by putative helix 3 (see Fig. 1, C and D), and the remaining C-terminal portion of the protein was deleted. This mutant protein will subsequently be referred to as OEP16-4β-helix 3. Both mutant proteins formed voltage-dependent channels after reconstitution into liposomes. Representative channel characteristics for OEP16-4β-helix 3 and OEP16-helix 3/2/3 are shown in Fig. 6 (A–D andE–F, respectively). Similar to the wtOEP channel, OEP16-4β-helix 3 and OEP16-helix 3/2/3 channels closed when higher positive or negative membrane potentials were applied (Fig. 6, A and E). However, strong flickering of the channel formed by OEP16-4β-helix 3 is apparent especially at positive membrane potentials (Fig.6 A). The reversal potential at a 12.5-fold KCl gradient wasE rev = +45 mV showing that the OEP16-4β-helix 3 channel reveals, similar to the channel formed by the wild type protein, a remarkable selectivity for cations over anions ( PK+/P Cl−≅ 12:1). The reversal potential of OEP16-helix 3/2/3 was nearly identical (E rev = +43 mV; PK+/P Cl−≅ 12.5:1, see Fig. 6 F). The current voltage relationship of both mutants was linear in symmetrical solutions. The slope conductance in symmetrical 250 mm KCl was Λ = 360 ± 15 pS for OEP16-4β-helix 3 (see Table II) and 384 ± 17 pS for OEP16-helix 3/2/3 (Table II, Fig. 6 F). These values as well as the conductance values at asymmetrical conditions (see Table II) are similar to those determined for the wild type recombinant protein. Moreover, both mutants were blocked by CuCl2 similar to wtOEP16 as shown in Fig. 6 D for the OEP16-4β-helix 3 channel. OEP16 belongs to a class of proteins located in the chloroplastic outer envelope membrane. These proteins, namely OEP14, OEP16, OEP21, and OEP24 (15.Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S.C.

A. 1990; 87: 5778-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) do not show significant overall homology to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins. However, OEP16 contains a sequence block of about 50 amino acids that is homologous to regions of the mitochondrial protein translocation components Tim17, Tim22, and Tim23 and to a lesser extent to the amino acid permease LivH of E. coli (22.Rassow J. Dekker P.T. van Wilpe S. Meijer M. Soll J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Within the chloroplast OEP family there are also sequence block similarities that might be important, although their functional significance remains to be established. At present we know that the common property of the chloroplast OEPs is their ability to form large but selective solute pores in vitro. Considering their location in the outer chloroplast membrane and their principle function as solute pores, the OEP proteins are functionally analogous to the outer membrane porins. However, because the OEPs lack sequence homology to porins perhaps they form a membrane pore with a new type of topology. The porins that mediate the uptake of nutrients across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria constitute the family of the so-called β-barrel pores (31.Jap B.K. Walian P.J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1073-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 32.Klebba P.E. Newton S.C. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These β-barrel proteins reveal a primary sequence without long hydrophobic stretches and form rather stable hydrogen-bonded β-barrel pores. In contrast, the secondary structure prediction of OEP16 and the CD spectra of the reconstituted protein indicate that the proteins contains both β-barrel and α-helical elements (15.Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9504-9509Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, cross-linking experiments indicate that a dimer of OEP16 is the minimal unit that forms the pore (15.Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9504-9509Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), whereas porins reveal trimeric functional units, the monomers of which each constitute a single β-barrel pore (31.Jap B.K. Walian P.J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1073-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 32.Klebba P.E. Newton S.C. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expect that the topology of OEP16 is quite distinct from the known β-barrel structure of classical porins. In this report we demonstrate that OEP16 purified from the outer membrane of pea chloroplasts and recombinant pea OEP16 purified from E. coli reveal identical channel properties following reconstitution. Thus, recombinant OEP16 is a convenient source of the protein for electrophysiological studies, because it is functionally active following reconstitution and can be easily produced in large quantities. We then attempted to identify the minimal segment of OEP16 that is still able to form the characteristic OEP16 channel. Starting from the full-length recombinant protein (wtOEP16), different mutant proteins were constructed and subsequently analyzed for channel activity. Our results, summarized in Table I, show that point mutations that should at least in part disrupt helical structures in putative helix 1 (amino acids 73–91) have no detectable effect on the basic channel properties of the reconstituted mutant proteins. The lack of channel blocking by CuCl2 in the Cys77→Ser mutant protein confirms our interpretation that this block was mainly due to the oxidation of proximate thiol groups (15.Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9504-9509Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The results obtained for the OEP16-derived peptides show that the minimal unit, which is still able to form a solute channel, extends from amino acids 22 through 93 (see Table II, Fig. 1 D). This peptide contains two putative β-sheets and one α-helical element. The α-helical segment may either be constituted by the amino acid sequence blocks of the putative helix 1 (amino acids 73–91) or helix 3 (amino acids 128–146) of wild type OEP16 (see Fig. 1 D). A pore formed by a mixture of strands and helical segments seems unlikely, because such a mixed structure of α/β-folds has as yet not been observed. Although both structural elements may be present in a channel protein, the actual pore is formed by only one of them (33.Gouaux E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 34.Lacy D.B. Stevens R.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 35.Montal M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because the minimal unit that was still able to form the OEP16 pore contained only one putative helix but two β-strands, it is likely that the OEP16 pore is formed by β-sheets. This is confirmed by the symmetrical voltage dependence exhibited by both the wtOEP16 and the mutant proteins. This voltage dependence of the open probability is also a characteristic feature of other reconstituted β-barrel pores like porins (36.Bishop N.D. Lea E.J.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 37.Berrier C. Besnard M. Ghazi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), β-CFTs ( β -barrel c hannel f orming t oxins) (38.Bashford C.L. Alder G.M. Fulford L.G. Korchev Y.E. Kovacs E. MacKinnon A. Pederzolli C. Pasternak C.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 150: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and of the protein-translocation pores in the outer membranes of chloroplasts and mitochondria (26.Hinnah S.C. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 27.Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). It seems that this voltage dependence is not generated by special structures in the pore lumen, and it is consequently considered to be an intrinsic feature of the β-barrel (39.Bainbridge G. Gokce I. Lakey J.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus the presence of this voltage dependence confirms that both the wtOEP16 and the mutant proteins constitute pores consisting of β-strands. But how many β-strands constitute the channel? Porins typically consist of 16–18 β-strands per monomer (7.Schirmer T. Keller T.A. Wang Y.-F. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 40.Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). But there exists also a small family of porins, namely OmpA, OprF, and Omp21, that consist of merely eight β-strands and also differ from classical porins by being functional as monomers (41.Sugawara E. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2507-2511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Baldermann C. Lupas A. Lubieniecki J. Engelhardt H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3741-3749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The estimated pore diameter of, e.g. OprF, is ∼2 nm (42.Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus proving that eight β-strands are sufficient to generate a large pore. Taking this, and geometrical considerations, into account, we assume that the minimal number of β-strands in the functional OEP16 channel has to be eight. Provided that all of the four putative β-strands of a OEP16 monomer are involved in pore formation, a dimer would be sufficient to form the functional unit. This suggestion is corroborated by the fact that a homodimer is a stable unit found in nonreducing SDS-PAGE of the native OEP16 isolated from pea (15.Pohlmeyer K. Soll J. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S.C. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9504-9509Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the minimal unit of OEP16 as defined in this study consists of only one pair of β-strands, suggesting a different scenario. One may speculate that only two of the four putative β-strands of wtOEP16 are required for pore formation, thus implying that the functional unit of the wtOEP16 is a tetramer. Then the pore formation by the mutant proteins could proceed comparable to that of the wtOEP16 thus requiring four copies of the minimal OEP16 unit. The correct re-assemblage of a β-barrel protein from smaller fragments has already been demonstrated with two complementary split variants of OmpA (44.Koebnik R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3527-3529Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown previously that a simple hydrophobic hexapeptide readily forms oligomeric β-sheets in membranes, thus indicating a remarkable facility of the process (45.Wimley W.C. Hristova K. Ladokhin A.S. Silvestro L. Axelsen P.H. White S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1091-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). From these findings we propose that the remaining β-strand pair of the minimal OEP16 unit is able to assemble into the eight-stranded solute channel. We thank Kaye Truscott for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2146333762,"Diphtheria toxin (DT) is a disulfide linked AB-toxin consisting of a catalytic domain (C), a membrane-inserting domain (T), and a receptor-binding domain (R). It gains entry into cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The low pH (∼5.5) inside the endosomes induces a conformational change in the toxin leading to insertion of the toxin in the membrane and subsequent translocation of the C domain into the cell, where it inactivates protein synthesis ultimately leading to cell death. We have used a highly reactive hydrophobic photoactivable reagent, DAF, to identify the segments of DT that interact with the membrane at pH 5.2. This reagent readily partitions into membranes and, on photolysis, indiscriminately inserts into lipids and membrane-inserted domains of proteins. Subsequent chemical and/or enzymatic fragmentation followed by peptide sequencing allows for identification of the modified residues. Using this approach it was observed that T domain helices, TH1, TH8, and TH9 insert into the membrane. Furthermore, the disulfide link was found on thetrans side leaving part of the C domain on thetrans side. This domain then comes out to thecis side via a highly hydrophobic patch corresponding to residues 134–141, originally corresponding to a β-strand in the solution structure of DT. It appears that the three helices of the T domain could participate in the formation of a channel from a DT-oligomer, thus providing the transport route to the C domain after the disulfide reductase separates the two chains.

Despite the fact that the structure of many of these toxins is now known, the mechanism of entry of these toxins into cells is far from clear (1.Pappenheimer Jr., A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 64-94Crossref Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 2.Collier R.J. Bacteriol. Rev. 1975; 39: 54-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Lacy D.B. Stevens R.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One of the major problems associated with getting an insight into the mechanism of entry is the very limited availability of information on the structure of membrane-bound toxins. Therefore, although diphtheria toxin (DT)1 is an extensively studied protein toxin, a detailed mechanism of entry still eludes us. DT consists of two chains, A and B, that are joined by a disulfide link and is composed of three structural domains: the NH2-terminal catalytic domain C (residues 1–193), transmembrane domain T (residues 205–378), and receptor-binding domain R (residues 386–535) (4.Choe S.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1464-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). DT enters cells by moving into the endosomal compartment using receptor-mediated endocytosis. The lowering of pH in the endosomes results in insertion of the toxin into the membrane and subsequent translocation of the A-chain into the cytosol, where it ADP-ribosylates the elongation factor-2, leading to inhibition of protein synthesis and eventual cell death (6.Sandvig K.

This approach involves the use of a hydrophobic photoactivable reagent that partitions into membranes and on photolysis labels the membrane-spanning domains of transmembrane proteins. However, in the absence of any membrane, i.e. in solution, they can also be used to map hydrophobic surfaces in proteins. We report here our results on hydrophobic photolabeling of diphtheria toxin when it is bound to membranes with diazofluorene (DAF). This reagent readily partitions into membranes and on photolysis generates a highly reactive carbene, which labels the membrane-spanning domains of transmembrane proteins (33.Lala A.K. Batliwala H.F. Bhat S. Pure Appl. Chem. 1990; 62: 1453-1456Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 34.Lala A.K. Bhat S. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1990; 12: 586-594PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of photolabeled DT led to identification of membrane-associated segments of DT, thus permitting us to build a model of membrane-associated DT. Our results indicate that, besides the TH8 and TH9 helices, other parts of the T and C domains, namely, the TH1 helix of the T domain and the CB6 β-strand of the C domain, are associated with the membrane. Finally, the intra-chain disulfide bond was observed to be on the transside.MATERIALS AND METHODSSpectral grade water was obtained using Milli-Q Plus (Water Millipore, Bedford, MA). Tritiated fluorenone was obtained by catalytic tritium exchange of 2-iodofluoren-9-one, at BRIT (Bombay). [2-3H]DAF (specific activity, 570 mCi/mmol) was prepared from [2-3H]fluorenone according to the procedure reported earlier (35.Pradhan D. Lala A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8242-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Lala A.K. Raja S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11348-11357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mutated diphtheria toxin strain (pET.15bψ WTDT in BL-21) with a single E148S mutation was purified essentially according to a reported procedure (37.D'Silva P.R. Lala A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16216-16222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The concentration of DT was estimated according to the procedure of Lowry et al. (38.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) was synthesized according to reported procedure (39.Eibl H. McIntyre J.O. Fleer E.A.M. Fleischer S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 40.Kallury R.K. Krull U.J. Thompson M. J. Org. Chem. 1987; 52: 5478-5480Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and stored as chloroform solution at −20 °C. The phospholipid content was measured by phosphate assay (41.Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4), containing 20 mm sodium acetate, or ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.2), containing 150 mm NaCl, were used for all experiments unless specified otherwise. Automated Edman degradation of photolabeled peptides was carried out using a Shimadzu gas-phase protein sequencer (PPSQ10) connected to an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. The samples were loaded either as electroblots on a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane or on glass fiber disks. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was carried out on a Shimadzu LC-10A system. Sonicated SUVs (single unilamellar vesicles) were used in all experiments. To prepare sonicated SUVs, appropriate concentrations of stock solution of 30% DOPG and 70% DOPC in CHCl3 were added to a glass tube, dried under argon or nitrogen gas, and then further dried under high vacuum for 8 h. The dried film was hydrated in 1 mL of degassed buffer with vortexing. The suspension was sonicated on ice using a sonifier (Branson Model B-30) until nearly optically clear. The resulting clear solution was spun at 15,850 × g to remove any titanium particles shed from the microtip during sonication. The SUVs were freshly prepared for all experiments.CNBr Fragmentation of Membrane-bound Photolabeled DT and Analysis of Fragments5 nmol of membrane-bound photolabeled-DT was subjected to CNBr fragmentation in 70% formic acid. The CNBr digest of photolabeled DT was run on a 16.5% Tris-Tricine gel system (42.Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar) and immediately electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane using 10 mmCAPS containing 30% methanol in transfer buffer (43.Mozdzanowski J. Speicher D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The PVDF membrane was stained for 1 min in 0.1% Coomassie Blue and destained in 50% methanol/water. Five bands corresponding to the molecular masses of the fragments CN-2, CN-3, CN-5, CN-8, and CN-9 were clearly visible on the PVDF membrane. The radioactive bands were excised and analyzed by sequencing in an automated gas-phase protein sequencer. Similarly 60 μg (1 nmol) of photolabeled vesicle-bound DT was analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to separate A and B chains followed by electroblotting as described above. The B-chain was subjected to Edman degradation.Isolation of the CN-7 Fragment (315–339) by Reverse Phase-HPLCThe CNBr digest of membrane-bound photolabeled DT (120 μg, 2 nmol) was dissolved in 20% formic acid and separated by reversed phase (RP)-HPLC on a Vydac C4 column (4.6 × 150 mm). A gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid from 0 to 15% in 5 min, 15 min (15–30%), 45 min (30–60%), 55 min (60–80%), and finally 80% acetonitrile for 10 min, was used. The flow rate was kept at 0.8 mL/min, the eluate was monitored at 216 nm, and fractions were at 1-min interval were collected. The fractions eluting between 19 and 21 min were pooled and concentrated. This fraction, which was identified as the CN-7 fragment by sequencing in an independent experiment, was dot-blotted on a methanol-treated PVDF membrane (washed with methanol for 5 s and then washed with water for 1 min) and dried completely for 4 min at 50 °C. The dot blot was thoroughly washed with water to remove acetic acid and subjected to sequencing in an automated gas-phase protein sequencer.Endoproteinase Glu-C Digestion180 μg (3 nmol) of membrane-bound photolabeled DT, isolated by gel-permeation column chromatography as described in the legend to Fig. 1, was subjected to endoproteinase Glu-C digestion. The proteolysis was performed in 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer, containing 150 mmNaCl, pH 5.2. Freshly prepared endoproteinase Glu-C (25% w/w) was added, and the whole preparation was incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. After 6-h digestion, additional protease (25% w/w) was added and incubated for the next 20 h. The released peptides and vesicle-bound residual toxin were separated by passing once again over a gel-permeation HPLC column. The void volume fraction corresponding to vesicle-bound proteolyzed toxin was concentrated and subjected to delipidation followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as mentioned in the legend to Fig. 1. The membrane-bound fragments so isolated were then analyzed on 16.5% Tris-Tricine gel and electroblotted on a PVDF membrane. There were large numbers of membrane-bound fragments that could be visualized on staining with Coomassie Blue and, based on their molecular masses, were found to be similar to that reported earlier (44.Quertenmont P. Wattiez R. Falmagne P. Ruysschaert J.M. Cabiaux V. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1283-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Many of these bands, which were blotted onto the PVDF membrane, were identified by peptide sequencing. The band corresponding to approximately 14 kDa was subjected to the Edman degradation. A single peptide beginning with Leu263(LKTVT … ) was detected. Sequencing could be carried out for 26 cycles, and the radioactivity release was monitored for each cycle.Isolation of A-chain from Membrane-bound Photolabeled DT and Cleavage by o-Iodosobenzoic Acid480 μg (8 nmol) of photolabeled membrane-bound DT was separated on preparative 12% SDS-PAGE Laemmli gels. The band corresponding to A- and B-chains was sliced from the gel and subjected to elution using a sonication extraction procedure (45.Retamal C.A. Thiebaut P. Alves E.W. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The bands were washed five times (10 min) with 5 mL of 250 mm Tris buffer containing 250 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, in Falcon tubes. The gel pieces were then washed five times with 5 mL of water. Finally, the gel pieces were crushed with a glass rod. The gel homogenate was resuspended in 2 mL of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% SDS. The samples were sonicated for 3 min, in an ice bath with a Branson B-30 probe sonicator. Samples were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was passed over 2 mL of Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The eluate was lyophilized, and protein recovery was found to be 80% as estimated by Lowry assay.125 μg of A-chain was dissolved in 100 μL of 12 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 4 m guanidine-HCl. This solution was then treated with a 2.5 m excess ofo-iodosobenzoic for 30 min and followed by lyophilization. The lyophilized sample was dissolved in 200 μL of 80% acetic acid containing 4 m guanidine-HCl and incubated for 20 h at 25 °C in the dark. This sample was then desalted on a PD-10 column and lyophilized. The digest (80 μg) was analyzed on the 16.5% Tris-Tricine gel system (42.Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar) and immediately electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane using 10 mm CAPS buffer containing 35% methanol in transfer buffer (43.Mozdzanowski J. Speicher D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Four bands of 15-, 11-, 7-, and 4.5-kDa molecular mass were clearly visible on Coomassie Blue staining. The 11- and 4.5-kDa bands were subjected to Edman degradation. Similarly, 25 μg of the digest of A-chain was analyzed on the same gel, and radioactivity associated with different bands was estimated by slicing the gel, solubilizing, and counting.RESULTSIn order to get structural information on membrane-associated DT, we partitioned DAF into DOPC-DOPG vesicles prepared at pH 5.2 and incubated with DT at a protein-to-lipid ratio of 1:250, leading to insertion of the latter in vesicles as confirmed by independent experiments. The whole preparation was then photolyzed and subjected to gel-permeation chromatography, and free DT was separated from the DT-bound vesicles. Under the experimental condition used, more than 80% of DT was bound to vesicles (Fig.1). Furthermore, the DT-bound vesicles were found to be stable at pH 5.2 for several hours and showed no signs of DT leaching from vesicles. Radioactive analysis of the eluant resulting from gel-permeation chromatography indicated that the bulk of the radioactivity was associated with vesicle-bound DT and not free DT (data not shown). However, because DAF is known to extensively label lipids also (34.Lala A.K. Bhat S. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1990; 12: 586-594PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Pradhan D. Lala A.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11348-11357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), vesicle-bound DT fractions were delipidated and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis along with free DT fractions. Although both samples showed bands corresponding to A- and B-chains on staining with Coomassie Blue, radioactivity was found to be associated only with A- and B-chains of vesicle-bound DT (Fig. 1, A andB). These results clearly indicate that, owing to the high partition coefficient of DAF in favor of the membrane hydrophobic core (34.Lala A.K. Bhat S. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1990; 12: 586-594PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Pradhan D. Lala A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8242-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Lala A.K. Raja S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11348-11357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), once DAF is partitioned into membranes it exclusively labels proteins associated with membrane and not soluble proteins that it would otherwise label in the absence of membranes. Further labeling of both A- and B-chain indicated that both chains insert into the membrane. This result is in agreement with previous studies (17.Papini E. Schiavo G. Tomasi M. Colombatti M.

Huynh P.D. Finkelstein A. Eisenberg D. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11254-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 115, 178, 182, 230, 314, 339, 459), which provide useful fragments for identification of DAF-modified sites by sequence analysis. These fragments could be separated by SDS-PAGE on Tris-Tricine gels, followed by electroblotting onto a PVDF membrane and Edman degradation. The molecular mass and NH2-terminal sequence analysis permitted identification of CN-2 (15–115, ENFSSYHG …), CN-3 (116–178, EQVGTEEF … ), CN-5 (NH2 terminus of B-chain, 194–230, SVGGSSLS … ), CN-8 (340–459, VAQAIPLV … ), and CN-9 (460–535, RCRAIGD … ).CNBr Fragmentation of Membrane-bound DT Labeled by DAF and SequencingBecause DAF photolabels only the membrane-embedded domains of transmembrane proteins (34.Lala A.K. Bhat S. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1990; 12: 586-594PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Pradhan D. Lala A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8242-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), DAF-labeled DT was subjected to CNBr fragmentation in an effort to get information on membrane-inserted domains of DT. The CNBr digest of DAF-labeled DT isolated from the vesicle fraction mentioned above was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2 A), which indicated that the different fragments were labeled. The NH2-terminal region of the CN-8 fragment corresponds to part of the two putative membrane-inserting hydrophobic helices TH8 (326–347) and TH9 (358–376) and the interlinking loop TL5 (348–357). Sequencing of this region indicated that, although 4 major residues belonging to TH9 (Ala356, Phe360, Leu367, and Val371) were labeled, no residue in the interlinking loop TL5 was labeled (Fig. 2 D). This is consistent with the hypothesis that the TL5 loop is present on thetrans side in the membrane-inserted state of DT (9.Madshus I.H. Wiedlocha A. Sandvig K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4648-4652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Malenbaum S.E. Collier R.J. London E.

Physiol. 1997; 110: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In order to obtain insertion site information on the other helix, TH8, CN-7 (315–339) was obtained by RP-HPLC analysis of the CNBr fragments on a C4 column. Sequencing of CN-7 indicated extensive labeling of Ala320, Ile328, Val329, Ile333, Gln342, Ala343, Ile344, and Pro345 (Fig. 2 C). A helical wheel representation of labeled residues in TH8 and TH9 indicated that primarily one side of the helices was labeled (Fig.2 B). This result, combined with the absence of labeling in the interlinking TL5 loop, suggest that these two buried hydrophobic helices found in the T domain of the solution structure of DT, insert into the membrane and maintain their helical motif. The sidedness of labeling seen in the helical wheel representation further suggests that the labeled sites correspond to the lipid-facing face of these helices in the membrane-associated state (Fig. 2 B). However, the labeling of Ala320 suggests that regions beyond these helices also interact with the membrane.Figure 2A, Tris-Tricine gel for CNBr digest of membrane-bound DT. 30 μg of CNBr digest of photolabeled DT was separated on 16.5% Tris-Tricine gel, and radioactive analysis of the CNBr fragments was carried out by gel staining and solubilization, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The schematicat the top gives the Coomassie Blue staining pattern, and thearrowheads indicate the positions of standard molecular mass markers and the CNBr fragments of DT.

C, radioactivity and mass release on Edman degradation of CNBr fragment CN7 (315–339) of DAF-labeled DT. The CN7 fragment was isolated by RP-HPLC using a Vydac C4 column described under “Materials and Methods,” dot blotted on a PVDF membrane, and subjected to Edman degradation. In each degradation cycle 60% of the sample was analyzed by direct injection using an on-line PTH analyzer for PTH-derivative release (picomoles, ♦). The remaining 40% of the sample was directed to a fraction collector and subsequently counted (cpm, ▪). A single peptide beginning with glycine-315 was detected. The sequence assignments could be made up to 25 cycles and are given on the top. The position of part of the TH8 helix is indicated by the arrowhead. D, radioactivity and mass release on Edman degradation of the CNBr fragment CN-8 (340–459) of DAF-labeled DT. The band corresponding to the CN-8 fragment was subjected to Edman degradation. A single peptide beginning with valine-340 was detected. The sequence assignments could be made for up to 37 cycles and are given at the top. PTH-derivative release (picomoles, ♦) and radioactivity released in the sequencing cycle (cpm, ▪) given at the top.

The entire fragment was sequenced until 37 cycles. The major labeled residues correspond to Trp206, Val208, Ile209, Thr213, Ile217, and Leu220. No residue was labeled in the sequence before or after the TH1 helix (Fig. 3 A). These data suggest that only the TH1 helix interacts with the membrane. TH1 is an amphiphilic helix; it is interesting to see that only the residues on the lipid facing the hydrophobic side of the helix are labeled (Fig. 3 B). The interaction of the TH1 helix with the membrane has been suggested earlier, although it has not been clear whether the helix lies on the membrane-water interface or transverses the membrane. Data in favor of the latter hypothesis have been growing recently (7.Moskaug J.O. Stenmark H. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2652-2659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Madshus I.H.

https://openalex.org/W1989543688,"Previous studies showed that natural human liver alcohol dehydrogenase γ exhibits negative cooperativity (substrate activation) with ethanol. Studies with the recombinant γ2 isoenzyme now confirm that observation and show that the saturation kinetics with other alcohols are also nonhyperbolic, whereas the kinetics for reactions with NAD+, NADH, and acetaldehyde are hyperbolic. The substrate activation with ethanol and 1-butanol are explained by an ordered mechanism with an abortive enzyme-NADH-alcohol complex that releases NADH more rapidly than does the enzyme-NADH complex. In contrast, high concentrations of cyclohexanol produce noncompetitive substrate inhibition against varied concentrations of NAD+ and decrease the maximum velocity to 25% of the value that is observed at optimal concentrations of cyclohexanol. Transient kinetics experiments show that cyclohexanol inhibition is due to a slower rate of dissociation of NADH from the abortive enzyme-NADH-cyclohexanol complex than from the enzyme-NADH complex. Fluorescence quenching experiments confirm that the alcohols bind to the enzyme-NADH complex. The nonhyperbolic saturation kinetics for oxidation of ethanol, cyclohexanol, and 1-butanol are quantitatively explained with the abortive complex mechanism. Physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol would be oxidized predominantly by the abortive complex pathway.

In contrast, high concentrations of cyclohexanol produce noncompetitive substrate inhibition against varied concentrations of NAD+ and decrease the maximum velocity to 25% of the value that is observed at optimal concentrations of cyclohexanol. Transient kinetics experiments show that cyclohexanol inhibition is due to a slower rate of dissociation of NADH from the abortive enzyme-NADH-cyclohexanol complex than from the enzyme-NADH complex. Fluorescence quenching experiments confirm that the alcohols bind to the enzyme-NADH complex. The nonhyperbolic saturation kinetics for oxidation of ethanol, cyclohexanol, and 1-butanol are quantitatively explained with the abortive complex mechanism. Physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol would be oxidized predominantly by the abortive complex pathway. human (Homo sapiens) liver alcohol dehydrogenase β and γ enzymes, respectively, otherwise named ADH1B and ADH1C (2.Duester G.

Class I alcohol dehydrogenases from human liver are homo- and heterodimers comprised of α, β, and γ subunits (1.Edenberg H.J. Bosron W.F. Guengerich F.P. Comprehensive Toxicology. 3.

Polymorphisms in theADH3 gene lead to the isoenzymesHsADHγ1, which has Gln-271 and Val-349, andHsADHγ2, with Arg-271 and Ile-349 (3.Höög J.-O. Hedén L.-O. Larsson K.

Further insights into the possible roles of alcohol dehydrogenases in alcoholism require quantitative descriptions of the kinetics of the various enzymes involved, but the properties of HsADHγ are a challenge because both isoenzymes exhibit negative cooperativity for ethanol oxidation (6.Bosron W.F. Magnes L.J. Li T.K. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1852-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and the mechanism has not yet been described. The negative cooperativity could arise from different mechanisms (9.Neet K.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 519-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Subunit interactions or “half-of-the-sites” reactivity (an extreme case of negative cooperativity) were reported for the horse liver E (ethanol active) enzyme (10.Bernhard S.A. Dunn M.F. Luisi P.L.

Other studies have found nonadditivity in the heterodimers of horse liver enzymes (15.Dworschack R.T. Plapp B.V.

Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), suggesting that the constituent subunits do not act independently. Nonhyperbolic kinetics may also involve mechanisms that do not include subunit interactions, such as a random mechanism (17.Cleland W.W. Wratten C.C. Schwert G.W. Winer A.D. The Mechanism of Action of Dehydrogenases: A Symposium in Honor of Hugo Theorell. The University Press of Kentucky, Lexington, KY1969: 103-129Google Scholar), a mixture of isoenzymes (18.Dubied A. von Wartburg J.-P. Bohlken D.P. Plapp B.V. J. Biol.

Negative cooperativity for ethanol oxidation was observed for a purified human liver alcohol dehydrogenase (18.Dubied A. von Wartburg J.-P. Bohlken D.P. Plapp B.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1464-1470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may have resulted from a mixture of isoenzymes in the preparation. Oxidation of cyclohexanol by horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase exhibits negative cooperativity (19.Dalziel K. Dickinson F.M. Biochem. J. 1966; 100: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and oxidation of ethanol and benzyl alcohol show substrate inhibition (21.Dalziel K. Dickinson F.M. Biochem.

These results are explained by an ordered mechanism with alternative pathways, including abortive enzyme-NADH-alcohol and binary enzyme-NADH complexes, which differ in the rate of dissociation of NADH. Substrate activation and inhibition observed for recombinant HsADHγ2 with different alcohols are explained by a similar mechanism. The plasmid for the expression ofHsADHγ2 (3.Höög J.-O. Hedén L.-O. Larsson K. Jörnvall H. von Bahr-Lindström H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 159: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Jan-Olov Höög (Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden).HsADHγ2 was expressed and purified as described previously (25.Stone C.L. Bosron W.F. Dunn M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 892-899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein homogeneity was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The concentration of active sites was measured by titration with NAD+ in the presence of 10 mm pyrazole (26.Theorell H. Yonetani T. Biochem. Z. 1963; 338: 537-553PubMed Google Scholar). The turnover number of the purified enzyme in a standard assay at 25 °C (27.Plapp B.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1727-1735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was 0.5 s−1. LiNAD+ (grade I) and Na2NADH (grade I) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Alcohols and carbonyl compounds were redistilled before use. Kinetic measurements were made in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 0.25 mm EDTA buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. Initial velocities were determined by monitoring the formation or oxidation of NADH with a Cary 118C spectrophotometer (ε340 = 6.22 mm−1cm−1) or an SLM Aminco 4800 fluorometer (λex= 340 nm; λem = 460 nm) and fitting the progress curves to a line or a parabola, which calculates the initial slope. Very wide ranges of concentrations of alcohols were used as substrates in some experiments, and velocities at the lowest concentrations were used only if the background rates in the presence of NAD+and enzyme and in the absence of alcohol were less than 10% of the measured rate. Steady-state kinetic data were analyzed using Cleland's programs (28.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Data for the nonhyperbolic saturation curves were fit to the TWOONE equation, Equation 1, which is the general form of the equation that describes either activation or partial inhibition by substrates. ν=V(dB+B2)c+bB+B2,Kb=b2−d+b2−d2+c1/2Equation 1 V is the velocity at saturating concentrations of the varied substrate, B, and b, c, and drepresent collections of rate constants from whichKb may be calculated (28.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Initial velocity data were fit with the SEQUEN program to the kinetic equation for a sequential Bi reaction in Equation 2, ν=V1ABKiaKb+KaB+KbA+ABEquation 2 where V 1 is the maximal velocity, A and B are coenzyme and substrate concentrations, K a andKb are the Michaelis constants, andKia is the dissociation constant for coenzyme. Data for inhibition by high concentrations of alcohol were fit with NONLIN (29.Johnson M.L. Frasier S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (511) Google Scholar) to the hyperbolic replot equation in Equation 3, ν=Vmax+VminB/Kd1+B/KdEquation 3 where V max andV min are the uninhibited and inhibited maximal velocities, respectively, and K d is the dissociation constant for the alcohol, B, from the inhibited form of the enzyme. Steady-state kinetics were simulated with KINSIM (30.Frieden C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Transient kinetic experiments used a BioLogic SFM3 stopped-flow instrument with a dead time of 2.5 ms. Data were analyzed with the BioKine Software. The rate constant for association of NAD+was obtained as described previously (31.Sekhar V.C. Plapp B.V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5082-5088Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using pyrazole to trap the enzyme-NAD+ complex and form the ternary complex (26.Theorell H. Yonetani T. Biochem. Z. 1963; 338: 537-553PubMed Google Scholar), which absorbs at 294 nm (Δε294 = 8400m−1 cm−1). The transients were measured at varied concentrations of NAD+ (0.09–0.27 mm) and pyrazole (0.5–5 mm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. The rate constants obtained from the exponential phase of each of the traces were fit to the SEQUEN equation (Equation 2). The rate constant for binding of NADH to free enzyme was determined by following quenching of protein fluorescence with λex = 294 nm and λem > 330 nm when 2 μn enzyme was mixed with 2–10 μm NADH in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. The rate constant for binding of NADH to the enzyme-alcohol binary complex was determined as described above in the presence of either ethanol (100–400 mm) or cyclohexanol (1–100 mm). The rate of dissociation of NADH from enzyme was measured by trapping free enzyme with 40 mm AMP (a concentration determined to be saturating) and monitoring the absorbance increase at 355 nm (Δε355 = 3800 m−1cm−1) that results from the shift in spectra for free and enzyme-bound NADH (32.Theorell H. Yonetani T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 106: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The earlier report of negative cooperativity (substrate activation) for ethanol saturation kinetics with natural HsADHγ2 isolated from human liver (6.Bosron W.F. Magnes L.J. Li T.K. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1852-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was confirmed with homogeneous recombinant enzyme (Fig.1 A). Ethanol saturation fit well to the TWOONE equation (Equation 1), and the “concave-up” curvature of the Eadie-Hofstee plot (9.Neet K.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 519-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) clearly indicates the negative cooperativity (Fig. 1 A). Because these results were obtained for the recombinant enzyme, isoenzyme heterogeneity is not likely to be the origin of the observed phenomenon. When the data from Fig.1 A are replotted as in Fig. 1 B, some substrate inhibition is also apparent with ethanol concentrations above 100 mm. The dashed and solid lines in Fig. 1 will be discussed later. Saturation kinetics of HsADHγ2 with other alcohols were also measured (Table I). Substrate inhibition, rather than activation, was observed for cyclohexanol (Fig. 1 C) and 1-hexanol, and mechanisms for these alcohols seem to be similar. The saturation data for cyclohexanol fit well to the TWOONE equation. The kinetic data for 1-hexanol (0.034–8.5 mm) saturation could also be described by the TWOONE equation but were best fit to the equation describing classical substrate inhibition (SUBIN, 28), although the highest concentration of alcohol decreased the velocity only to 80% of the maximum. Interestingly, 1-butanol (Fig. 1 D) andR-2-butanol kinetics exhibit both activation and inhibition. Oxidation of 1-butanol and R-2-butanol reaches maximal rates of 0.72 s−1 and 0.19 s−1, respectively, before the inhibition is observed. The steady-state kinetics of methanol oxidation were hyperbolic, exhibiting no indication of activation or inhibition.Table IAlcohol saturation kinetics of human liver alcohol dehydrogenase γ2AlcoholSaturation patternVK bV/K bs −1μmmm −1 s −1EthanolActivation0.551105.0MethanolHyperbolic0.093150,0000.00062CyclohexanolInhibition0.122.255l-HexanolInhibition0.319.234l-ButanolActivation & inhibition0.721106.5R-2-ButanolActivation & inhibition0.196400.30Initial velocities were measured in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 0.25 mm EDTA buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C with varied concentrations of alcohols and a saturating level of 2 mmNAD+. Values for V and K b were obtained from fits to the TWOONE equation (Equation 1), except for the data for methanol, which were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and for 1-hexanol, which were fitted to the SUBIN equation, ν =VB/(K b + B + B2/K I), yielding K I = 28 mm. The value of V for cyclohexanol represents the value extrapolated to high, inhibitory concentrations of alcohol. The errors were less than 15% of the values, which indicates that the fits are good (28.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Initial velocities were measured in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 0.25 mm EDTA buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C with varied concentrations of alcohols and a saturating level of 2 mmNAD+.

The errors were less than 15% of the values, which indicates that the fits are good (28.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). The initial velocity kinetics were studied in more detail by collecting data for the forward and reverse reactions with concentrations of the coenzymes and substrates varied over wide ranges. Kinetics for ethanol and cyclohexanol saturation showed nonhyperbolic behavior, even at saturating concentrations of NAD+, which suggests that the activation and inhibition by the alcohols are not likely to be the result of a random Bi Bi mechanism (19.Dalziel K. Dickinson F.M. Biochem. J. 1966; 100: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, the saturation kinetics for NAD+, acetaldehyde, cyclohexanone, and NADH were hyperbolic. Initial velocity data collected for physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol fit well to the SEQUEN equation (Equation 2), and good estimates of the steady-state kinetic constants could be obtained (Table II). Similarly, by using the noninhibitory concentrations of cyclohexanol, a good fit to the SEQUEN equation was obtained. The K eq values, calculated by the Haldane relationship from the steady-state kinetic constants for both ethanol and acetaldehyde or cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone reactions, are in good agreement with other reported values (33.Sund H. Theorell H. The Enzymes. 1963; 7: 25-67Google Scholar, 34.Ainslie Jr., G.R. Cleland W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 946-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates that the kinetic constants obtained from these initial velocity studies are self-consistent. The values for the Michaelis and inhibition constants for the ethanol and acetaldehyde reactions are somewhat smaller (3–4-fold) than those obtained previously for HsADHγ2 and clearly different from the values for the other human liver class I enzymes (6.Bosron W.F. Magnes L.J. Li T.K. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1852-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the kinetic constants for the respective substrates are similar to those for EqADHE acting on ethanol (15.Dworschack R.T. Plapp B.V. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or cyclohexanol (19.Dalziel K. Dickinson F.M. Biochem. J. 1966; 100: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 34.Ainslie Jr., G.R. Cleland W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 946-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that V 1 andV 2 for the horse liver enzyme are larger than those of HsADHγ2. For ethanol oxidation byHsADHγ2, the values forV 1 and Kb in Table IIagree well with the values obtained from the TWOONE analysis (Table I). Thus, the values obtained from the initial velocity studies describe the activity in the activation region of the ethanol saturation curve.Table IISteady-state kinetic constants for human liver alcohol dehydrogenase γ2ConstantEthanol/acetaldehydeaConcentration ranges were 0.2–50 mm for ethanol, 0.005–1 mm for NAD+, 0.2–2 mm for acetaldehyde, and 5–30 μm for NADH.Cyclohexanol/cyclohexanonebConcentration ranges were 10–220 μm for cyclohexanol, 3–20 μm for NAD+, 0.5–10 mm for cyclohexanone, and 3–10 μm for NADH.K a (μm)2.85K b (μm)140110K p (μm)1901500K q (μm)7.62.0K ia (μm)6567K iq (μm)0.550.54V 1 (s−1)0.450.38V 2 (s−1)143.2K eq (pM)cCalculated from the Haldane relationship,K eq = (V 1 K p K iq[H+])/(V 2 K b K ia).12410Initial velocity and product inhibition studies were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 0.25 mm EDTA buffer at pH 7.5 and 25 °C.

The error of the fitted value forK a is 50% for cyclohexanol; all other errors are ≤15% of the fitted values. On the basis of the experimental results described herein, the participation of an abortive complex pathway (Scheme FS1, A = NAD+, B = alcohol, P = aldehyde or ketone, and Q = NADH) is the best explanation for the nonhyperbolic kinetics observed for the steady-state kinetics with ethanol, cyclohexanol, and 1-butanol. Steps 1–5 represent the rate constants that describe the Ordered Bi Bi mechanism. For the class I alcohol dehydrogenases, the rate-limiting step for the reaction mechanism is often the release of NADH (k 5) for the oxidation of alcohols or release of NAD+ (k −1) for the reductive reaction. The abortive complex pathway bypasses step 5 and includes steps 6–8. With saturating concentrations of NAD+and concentrations of alcohol sufficient to form the enzyme-alcohol-NADH complex (EBQ), release of NADH from this complex (k 7) may become rate-limiting. The presence of such a pathway can lead to either substrate activation or inhibition (19.Dalziel K. Dickinson F.M. Biochem. J. 1966; 100: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22.Theorell H. McKinley-McKee J.S. Acta Chem. Scand. 1961; 15: 1811-1833Crossref Google Scholar, 23.Shearer G.L. Kim K. Lee K.M.

Substrate activation would be observed whenk 7 > k 5, and substrate inhibition would result when k 7 <k 5. Substrate inhibition could also occur with low concentrations of NAD+ and concentrations of alcohol sufficient to bind to free enzyme (Scheme FS1, step 8; Refs. 19.Dalziel K. Dickinson F.M. Biochem. J. 1966; 100: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and 21.Dalziel K. Dickinson F.M. Biochem. J. 1966; 100: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The rate equation for the abortive complex pathway describing alcohol saturation kinetics under conditions of saturating NAD+takes the form of the TWOONE equation (Equation 1) whenk −6 ≫ k 7 andk 4 ≫ k 5 ork 7 is assumed (Equation 4) (23.Shearer G.L. Kim K. Lee K.M. Wang C.K. Plapp B.V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11186-11194Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) ν=V(Kqbk5B/V+B2)KbKqb+(Vk−2/k2k4+Kqb)B+B2Equation 4 where Kb is the Michaelis constant for the alcohol, K qb is the dissociation constant of the alcohol from the enzyme-alcohol-NADH abortive complex,k −6/k 6, and Vis k 7. The oxidation of various alcohols may be expected to differ in the relative rate constants for the steps in the abortive complex pathway and produce either substrate activation or inhibition that would be diagnostic for the abortive complex pathway. The following experimental results provide evidence for the abortive complex pathway and estimates for the rate constants for the mechanisms of reactions with three alcohols. The kinetics of inhibition by concentrations of cyclohexanol exceeding those required for maximum velocity was analyzed by an initial velocity study with varied concentrations of NAD+ at different fixed concentrations of cyclohexanol (Fig.2 A). The inhibition is described by both hyperbolic intercept (1/V) and linear slope (K/V) effects (Fig. 2 B). The intercept effect suggests that cyclohexanol is exerting its inhibitory effect by binding to a form of the enzyme distinct from that to which NAD+ binds, such as enzyme-NADH, to form an abortive complex. That the intercept effect is hyperbolic indicates that the inhibited rate reaches a lower limit, which in the context of the abortive complex pathway would be limited by k 7. The fit to the hyperbolic replot equation of the apparentV max (from each NAD+ saturation curve) versus cyclohexanol concentration (Fig.2 B) gives values for V max,V min, and K d, which can be assigned to k 5, k 7, andK qb in Equation 4, respectively. The presence of a slope effect for the inhibition also indicates that cyclohexanol and NAD+ can compete for free enzyme. The enzyme-cyclohexanol complex apparently does not readily bind NAD+ to form the active ternary complex. Transient kinetic experiments also showed that 400 mm 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, an analogue of ethanol that does not react with the NAD+, decreases the rate constant for the association of NAD+ to 28% of the value in the absence of alcohol. These results are consistent with an ordered mechanism that requires NAD+ to bind before alcohol. A similar inhibition study was also performed with high concentrations of 1-butanol (Fig. 2 C). Substrate inhibition by 1-butanol is described primarily by a slope (K/V) effect, which indicates that 1-butanol inhibits HsADHγ2 by competing against NAD+ for binding to free enzyme (Fig.2 D). The effects on intercepts (1/V) are relatively small and do not permit a good fit to the hyperbolic replot equation. Because 1-butanol saturation kinetics exhibit substrate activation with low concentrations of alcohol and inhibition by high concentrations, it appears that the activation arises from the abortive complex pathway, whereas the inhibition involves competition between NAD+ and 1-butanol for free enzyme. Evidence that the enzyme-NADH-alcohol abortive complex can form was obtained by measuring the quenching of NADH fluorescence during titration of the enzyme-NADH complex with cyclohexanol and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (Fig. 3). The dissociation constants of the alcohols from the abortive complexes were 11 and 12 mm for cyclohexanol and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, respectively. The effects of the abortive complex on the kinetics were studied further by a quantitative analysis of the inhibition by cyclohexanol. The cyclohexanol saturation data (Fig. 1 C) were fitted by the TWOONE equation (Table I). This analysis shows that the inhibition is partial and the maximally inhibited rate is 0.12 s−1. The ratio of the value for V from the TWOONE fit to that ofV 1 from the initial velocity study (Table II) indicates that high concentrations of cyclohexanol decrease the activity of HsADHγ2 to ∼25% of the maximum velocity observed at optimal concentrations of cyclohexanol. The partial substrate inhibition was further investigated by determining rates at inhibitory concentrations of cyclohexanol (2.5–200 mm) and fitting the data (Fig.4 A) with a hyperbolic replot equation (Equation 3). This analysis determined that the maximum (V max) and minimum (V min) rates were 0.38 and 0.08 s−1, respectively, values that are in good agreement wi"

The CaMnt1p is a type II membrane protein, which is part of a family of proteins that are important for both <i>O</i>- and<i>N</i>-linked mannosylation in fungi and which represent a distinct subclass of glycosyltransferase enzymes. Here we use heterologous expression of <i>CaMNT1</i> in the methylotrophic yeast <i>Pichia pastoris</i> to characterize the properties of the CaMnt1p enzyme as an example of this family of enzymes and to identify key amino acid residues required for coordination of the metal co-factor and for the retaining nucleophilic mechanism of the transferase reaction. We show that the enzyme can use both Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> as metal ion co-factors and that the reaction catalyzed is specific for α-methyl mannoside and α1,2-mannobiose acceptors. The N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domains, and stem regions were shown to be dispensable for activity, whereas truncations to the C-terminal catalytic domain destroyed activity without markedly affecting transcription of the truncated gene."
https://openalex.org/W2009120394,"We examined the role that aromatic residues located in the transmembrane helices of the α1a-adrenergic receptor play in promoting antagonist binding. Since α1-antagonists display low affinity binding at β2-adrenergic receptors, two phenylalanine residues, Phe-163 and Phe-187, of the α1a-AR were mutated to the corresponding β2-residue. Neither F163Q nor F187A mutations of the α1a had any effect on the affinity of the α1-antagonists. However, the affinity of the endogenous agonist epinephrine was reduced 12.5- and 8-fold by the F163Q and F187A mutations, respectively. An additive loss in affinity (150-fold) for epinephrine was observed at an α1a containing both mutations. The loss of agonist affinity scenario could be reversed by a gain of affinity with mutation of the corresponding residues in the β2 to the phenylalanine residues in the α1a. We propose that both Phe-163 and Phe-187 are involved in independent aromatic interactions with the catechol ring of agonists. The potency but not the efficacy of epinephrine in stimulating phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis was reduced 35-fold at the F163Q/F187A α1a relative to the wild type receptor. Therefore, Phe-163 and Phe-187 represent novel binding contacts in the agonist binding pocket of the α1a-AR, but are not involved directly in receptor activation.

All of these AR subtypes bind the endogenous catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine and mediate the actions of the sympathetic nervous system (1.Hwa J. De Young M.B. Perez D.M. Graham R.M. The Autonomic Nervous System: Nervous Control of the Heart. IX. Harwood Academic Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1996Google Scholar). The proposed topography adopted by these G protein-coupled receptors in the plasma membrane is modeled to that of bacteriorhodopsin, in which the protein folds to a highly ordered structure comprised of a series of seven hydrophobic transmembrane (TM)1-spanning domains, linked by three intracellular and three extracellular loops (2.Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Nature. 1997; 387: 203-211Crossref Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the cloned adrenergic receptors illustrates the greatest residue conservation is found within the transmembrane helix domains. Accordingly, the binding pocket for epinephrine and norepinephrine is localized to this region in all adrenergic receptors, within the circular array of TM helices in the rhodopsin-like core of the receptor (3.Dixon R.A.F. Sigal I.S. Rands E. Register R.B. Candelore M.R. Blake A.D. Strader C.D. Nature. 1987; 326: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Although differences in the agonist binding interactions at different adrenergic receptor subtypes exist, in general, the catecholamine is stabilized in the binding pocket by an ionic interaction involving the protonated amine of epinephrine and an aspartic acid residue in TM3 (4.Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Register R.B Candelore M.R. Rands E Dixon R.A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4384-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), by hydrogen bonds between the catechol hydroxyl groups of the agonist and serine residues in TM5 (5.Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13572-13578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and by an aromatic/hydrophobic interaction involving the catechol ring of the agonist and a phenylalanine residue in TM6 (6.Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A.F. FASEB J. 1989; 8: 1825-1832Crossref Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The β-hydroxyl of the agonist, which confers stereoselectivity, has been identified in the β2-AR as interacting with Asn-293 in TM6 (7.Wieland K. Zuurmond H.M. Krasel C. Ijzerman A.P. Lohse M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9276-9281Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), but is not conserved in the α1- and α2-ARs, highlighting the potential differences in agonist binding among family members. For the endogenous agonists, epinephrine and norepinephrine, it is thought that all the point contacts with the receptor have been identified. Our understanding of the molecular interactions promoting antagonist binding to adrenergic receptors is limited. We have proposed that the plane of the antagonist binding pocket on these receptors lies above that of the agonist binding pocket, since we have identified that the α1a-AR-selective antagonists phentolamine and WB4101 make point contacts with three residues in the second extracellular loop of the receptor (8.Zhao M.M. Hwa J. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies conducted on a series of β2-/α1a-AR chimeric receptors were unable to identify further point contacts between these antagonists and other extracellular loop residues of the α1a-AR (9.Zhao M.M. Gaivin R.J. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Two other studies have identified the importance of phenylalanine residues located close to the extracellular surface of the receptor in antagonist binding at adrenergic receptors. In the α2-AR, a single phenylalanine residue (Phe-412) at the top of TM7 promotes high affinity binding of yohimbine (10.Suryanarayana S. Daunt D.A. Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15488-15492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mutagenesis of a phenylalanine residue (Phe-82) in the upper regions of TM2 in the α1a-AR accounts for the α1a selectivity of the dihydropyridine antagonists (11.Hamaguchi N. True T.A. Saussy D.L. Jeffs P.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14312-14317Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These interactions on their own cannot account for the high affinity binding of all these antagonists to adrenergic receptors. Therefore, the adrenergic receptor antagonists must make additional contact with as yet unidentified residues located within the transmembrane helices of the receptor. Given that residues in the second extracellular loop connecting TM4 and TM5 have been implicated in binding antagonists at α1-ARs and that α1-AR antagonists contain high aromatic character, we evaluated the role that aromatic residues located at the top of these TM helices may have in binding adrenergic receptor antagonists. Specifically, we identified two phenylalanine residues (Phe-163, Phe-187) located in the upper regions of TM4 and TM5, respectively, of the α1a-AR that were obvious candidates for mutagenesis. This selection was influenced by neither residue being conserved in the β2-AR, a receptor at which these α1-AR selective antagonists possess markedly reduced affinity (10,000-fold lower). Here we unexpectedly report that, although neither mutation altered the pharmacological phenotype with regard to antagonist binding at the α1a-AR, these mutations had significant effects on the binding of catecholamine and phenethylamine agonists at this receptor, agonists for which all receptor contacts were thought to have been identified. Since these phenylalanine residues are not conserved in α2-ARs and β-ARs, these results stress the differences in the agonist binding pocket of adrenergic receptors despite the fact they all bind the same endogenous ligands. Drugs were obtained from the following manufacturers. Clonidine, dichloroisoproterenol, ephedrine, (−)-epinephrine, isoproterenol, metaproterenol, methoxamine, oxymetazoline, phentolamine, phenylephrine, prazosin, propranolol, and theophylline were from Sigma; [125I]HEAT and [3H]myoinositol were from NEN Life Science Products; [125I]CYP and [3H]cAMP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; albuterol, ICI 118,551, 5′-methylurapidil, niguldipine, nylidrin, and WB4101 were from Research Biochemicals Inc. (Natick, MA). Chemicals for biological solutions were obtained as follows: HEPES (free acid), EGTA, and MgCl2 from Mallinckrodt Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ) and ammonium formate from Fisher (Pittsburg, PA). Formic acid and perchloric acid were from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). Site-directed mutagenesis of the pMT2′ rat α1a-AR plasmid was performed using polymerase chain reaction technology using commercially synthesized oligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc.) specifically designed to code for the desired mutation. A fragment of cDNA encoding the F163Q mutation of the rat α1a-AR was generated using a sense primer containing the unique EcoRI cloning site before the start site of translation and an antisense primer targeted to the unique NaeI site of the rat α1a-AR that also encoded the mutation. The F187A mutation was generated using a sense primer containing the mutation that was targeted to the endogenousNaeI restriction site and an antisense primer containing theNotI restriction site after the stop codon. Using theExpand high fidelity PCR protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the EcoRI-F163Q-NaeI fragment was generated using 1 μg of pMT2′ rat α1a-AR plasmid, 300 nm each of sense and antisense primers, 200 nm each of dNTPs, and 2.6 units of Taq andPwo DNA polymerase in a 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20, and a final MgCl2 concentration of 1.5 mm. TheNaeI-F187A-NotI fragment was generated using the same protocol as before except that the reaction was performed with a final MgCl2 concentration of 4 mm. The amplification reactions, repeated for 40 cycles, consisted of denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min and an annealing and elongation phase at 72 °C for another 3 min. The resulting 550- and 900-base pair fragments from each of the PCR reactions were isolated and purified followed by a EcoRI/NaeI orNaeI/NotI restriction enzyme digest, respectively. The PCR products were ligated with each other or with their respective WT fragment and subcloned into the pMT2′ expression vector to yield the full-length rat α1a-AR construct containing single or double mutations. Mutation(s) were confirmed by full-length sequence analysis of the construct by the dideoxy method (Cleveland Clinic Sequencing Core Facility). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the synthetic β2-AR gene construct, previously shown to code for a receptor protein with similar pharmacology to that of the hamster β2-AR (12.Noda K. Saad Y. Graham R.M. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6743-6752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This construct codes for a 5′EcoRI restriction site upstream of the start codon and terminates with a stop codon and a NotI restriction site, permitting its subcloning into the mammalian expression plasmid pMT2′. The coding region contains unique restriction sites spaced about 50 base pairs apart to facilitate mutagenic cassette replacement. Mutagenesis of the β2-AR at positions Gln-170 and Ala-202 was performed by cassette replacement using synthetic oligonucleotides that introduce the phenylalanine codon at the desired location (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmid DNA was prepared following transformation into DH5α cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) and purified by RNase treatment and column chromatography using the Wizard maxiprep kit (Promega, Madison, WI). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (Sequenase; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were maintained and passaged upon reaching confluence by standard cell culture techniques. Experiments were conducted on cells between passages 10 and 25. Cells were transiently transfected with either the wild type or mutated α1a-AR or β2-AR cDNA subcloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pMT2′, using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (13.Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar). Transiently transfected COS-1 cells were scraped 72 h after transfection, collected, and washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), then pelleted under low speed centrifugation (1260 × g for 5 min). The cell pellet was re-suspended in a 0.25 m sucrose solution and after an additional low speed centrifugation step, the pellet was resuspended in a 10-ml volume of water containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (leupeptin (40 μg), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (68 μg), bacitracin (400 μg), and benzamidine (400 μg)) and frozen at −70 °C for 30 min. Membranes were prepared from the cell suspension by 20 strokes of a “B” glass Dounce homogenizer. Nuclear debris was removed by a low speed centrifugation step. Membranes in the supernatant were washed with HEM buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.4 mm EGTA, and 12.5 mmMgCl2) and pelleted by high speed centrifugation (30,000 × g for 15 min). Two further washes of the membrane pellet with HEM buffer (20 ml) were performed, and the final pellet was reconstituted in a known volume of HEM buffer containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and stored at −70 °C until use. The protein concentration of the membrane preparation was determined by performing a Bradford assay, using bovine serum albumin as the known standard (14.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Saturation binding experiments to measure the affinity of [125I]HEAT or [125I]CYP at α1a-ARs and β2-ARs, respectively, were performed as described previously (12.Noda K. Saad Y. Graham R.M. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6743-6752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar). The binding affinities of various adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists were determined in a series of competition binding experiments. For assays investigating the ligand binding properties of the wild type and mutant α1a-ARs, receptors were labeled with the α1-AR selective antagonist, [125I]HEAT. Studies conducted on the various β2-ARs measured the displacement of the β2-AR selective antagonist, [125I]CYP. All binding assays were performed in duplicate in HEM buffer, in a total assay volume of 250 μl. Aliquots of COS-1 cell membranes expressing the α1-AR were incubated with 100 pm[125I]HEAT and a range of 12 different concentrations of the competing agonist or antagonist. Nonspecific binding was defined as the amount of radioactivity that remained bound to the filters in the presence of 10−4m phentolamine. COS-1 cell membranes expressing the β2-ARs were incubated with 30 pm [125I]CYP and 12 competing concentrations of ligand. Nonspecific binding in these assays was determined by the radioactivity bound in the presence of 10−6mpropranolol. All assays were incubated in a shaking water bath at 22 °C for 60 min, after which unbound radioactivity was separated from membrane bound radioactivity by filtration through Whatman GF/C filter paper using a Brandel cell harvester. Filters were washed with 20 ml of ice-cold HEM buffer to remove further nonspecifically bound radioactivity. Bound radioactivity remaining on the filters was counted on a ICN γ-counter operating at 79.8% efficiency. Studies to investigate the signaling capacity of the F163Q/F187A α1a-AR relative to the wild type α1a-AR were performed on COS-1 cells, plated on 60-mm culture plates, and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method, using concentrations of the two α1a-AR cDNA constructs that resulted in equal membrane expression levels of the receptor. [3H]Myoinositol (3 μCi) was added to each plate 48 h after transfection and incubated for another 16 h prior to experimentation to permit uptake by the fibroblasts. Measurement of intracellular IP levels was performed under serum-free conditions by washing the cells with 10 ml of serum-free DMEM. To prevent complete hydrolysis of inositol phosphate moieties, assays were conducted in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor, LiCl (10 mm), in a total assay volume of 3 ml. Bolus concentrations of epinephrine were added directly to the media and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. A concentration-response curve for epinephrine was generated over a suitable range of concentrations performing each data point in triplicate. Incubations were terminated by removal of the medium containing the agonist and adding a 1-ml volume of a 0.4 mperchloric acid solution. The cell lysate was scraped, collected, and neutralized by the addition of a 0.5 ml volume of a 0.72 nKOH, 0.6 m KHCO3 solution. Soluble inositol phosphates in the lysate were isolated by passage through a Bio-Rad AG 1X-8 resin column that was buffered with a 0.1 m formic acid solution. After washing the column with 0.1 m formic acid, bound [3H]IPs were displaced from the column by eluting the column with a 0.1 m formic acid solution containing 1 m ammonium formate. The eluant was collected directly in scintillation vials, scintillant added and the radioactivity detected using a β-counter (Beckman, Irvine, CA). Studies to investigate the signaling capacity of the mutant β2-ARs relative to the wild type receptor were conducted in COS-1 cells transiently transfected to express the wild type or point mutated β2-ARs. Transfected conditions were titered so that the wild type and mutant receptors were expressed at equal receptor densities. Measurements of the intracellular cAMP levels were made under serum-free conditions in 3 ml of DMEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 5 mm theophylline to prevent phosphodiesterase-mediated breakdown. Agonists (either isoproterenol or ephedrine) were added directly to the medium and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Concentration-response curves for each agonist were constructed over a suitable range of concentrations performing each data point in duplicate. Incubations were terminated by the removal of the medium containing the agonist and the addition of 200 μl of a 0.1 m HCl solution. The cell lysate was scraped and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. The residual concentration of cAMP in the lysate of each individual plate was determined by a radioimmunoassay kit, following the manufacturer's directions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Radioactivity was counted using a β-counter (Beckman). Competition binding and functional data were analyzed using the non-linear regression functions of the non-iterative curve fitting program GraphPad Prism. Binding affinities (K i) were determined by transformation of the program calculated IC50 value using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. The binding data for each ligand was modeled to one- or two-site binding. The most suitable model was determined by performing an F test comparison of the least sum-of squares fit of the data to these equations. Functional data for cAMP stimulation or IP release in COS-1 cells was fit to a sigmoidal concentration-response curve. In functional experiments, the term potency applies to the concentration of agonist that stimulates the half-maximal response (EC50). Statistically significant differences in the potency of agonists were determined by t test analysis. Structure-activity studies in our laboratory and others have enhanced our understanding of the molecular interactions involved in promoting the binding of both agonists and antagonists to the various subtypes of the α1-adrenergic receptor family. Although agonists bind within the rhodopsin-like core of the receptor to well defined residues (15.Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6322-6327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 16.Chen S. Xu M. Lin F. Lee D. Riek P. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16320-16330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), our knowledge to date indicates that antagonists interact with residues in the receptor that are closer to or exposed on the extracellular face of the receptor. For example, phentolamine and WB4101 interact with three consecutive residues of the second extracellular loop of the α1a-AR (8.Zhao M.M. Hwa J. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar). However, the interaction of the antagonists with these residues can only account for a fraction of the total energy required to promote their high affinity binding to the receptor. Aromaticity has an important function in ligand binding at adrenergic receptors, as demonstrated by the direct involvement of a phenylalanine residue in TM6 in promoting agonist and antagonist binding at the β2-AR (6.Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A.F. FASEB J. 1989; 8: 1825-1832Crossref Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and α1b-AR (16.Chen S. Xu M. Lin F. Lee D. Riek P. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16320-16330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, early pharmacophore studies indicated that the phenyl ring, conserved in all adrenergic receptor agonists, is a critical requirement for agonist properties (17.Easson L.H. Stedman E. Biochem J. 1933; 27: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the structure of α1-AR antagonists conserve the aromaticity, these antagonists may also potentially bind to α1-ARs via interactions with accessible phenylalanine residues in the receptor. Consideration of the amino acid sequences in the transmembrane helix regions identified two phenylalanine residues as candidates that may be involved in promoting antagonist binding at α1-ARs. The first of these residues is located in the first helical turn of TM helix 4, and the other is located in the upper regions of TM helix 5. These candidate residues were selected since neither of these phenylalanine residues is conserved in the corresponding position of the β2-AR (Fig. 1), a receptor at which all of the α1a-AR selective antagonists display 10,000-fold lower affinity. Furthermore, both residues are located directly below the second extracellular loop of the receptor at a distance we expect would permit the antagonists to maintain their other previously determined interactions. Therefore, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the Phe-163 and Phe-187 residues in the α1a-AR, substituting to the corresponding residue in the β2-AR. The phenotype resulting from these mutations in the adrenergic receptors was assessed in terms of its binding profile for both antagonists and agonists. The roles of Phe-163 and Phe-187 in promoting antagonist binding to α1a-ARs were evaluated directly in radioligand binding studies. However, contrary to our expectations, the results of our competition binding studies did not support our hypothesis. In saturation binding studies, the radiolabeled antagonist [125I]HEAT bound to the wild type and each of the single as well as double mutant receptors with equal affinity (TableI). The affinities of a panel of α1-AR selective antagonists at either the F163Q α1a-AR or the F187A α1a-AR were not significantly different from their respective affinity at the wild type α1a-AR.

Previously, we have suggested that the second extracellular loops in G protein-coupled receptors may fold over the top of the receptor. Since phentolamine and WB4101 make point contacts with residues on this corresponding loop of the α1a-AR (8.Zhao M.M. Hwa J. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar), we speculated that the folding of the loop orients other pharmacophores in these antagonists such that they project toward and interact with phenylalanine residues at the top of the transmembrane helices. Our results would suggest that the orientation of the loop does not bring the antagonists into proximity with the TM4 or TM5 helices. Rather, the results of other mutagenesis studies in the α1b-AR identifying a phenylalanine residue in TM6 as a key contact (16.Chen S. Xu M. Lin F. Lee D. Riek P. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16320-16330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), as well as other studies in the α2-AR that suggest TM7 plays a role in antagonist binding (10.Suryanarayana S. Daunt D.A. Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15488-15492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), would indicate that the loop is oriented to bring the antagonists into close contact with these helices. To complete the characterization of the F163Q- and F187A-α1a-AR mutations, the affinities of a panel of agonists (Fig. 2) was determined in additional competition binding studies. K i values for five α1-AR agonists are shown in Table I. Unlike the results obtained with the antagonists, mutagenesis of either phenylalanine residue in the α1a-AR had considerable effects on the binding affinities of agonists at this receptor. In COS-1 cells, overexpressed α1-ARs display single-site competition curves with Hill coefficients near unity. The addition of GTP analogues does not change the slope significantly and were not used in these competition studies. The affinity of the endogenous agonist epinephrine was reduced 12.5-fold by the F163Q mutation (p < 0.01) and by a factor of 8-fold by the F187A mutation (p < 0.01), suggesting that each phenylalanine residue is directly involved in stabilizing the catecholamine in the agonist binding pocket of the α1a-AR. Furthermore, we argue that the impaired binding of epinephrine at the mutated α1a-AR is not the result of changes in the"

Lysine 115 is found within a highly conserved six-amino acid loop (LGEKLT) that forms a 90° turn between EF-hand III and EF-hand IV in the carboxyl-terminal lobe. In the present work a mutagenesis approach was used to investigate the structural features of the carboxyl-terminal lobe that lead to the specificity of calmodulin methylation. Three structural regions within the carboxyl-terminal lobe appear to be involved in methyltransferase recognition: the highly conserved six-amino acid loop-turn region that contains lysine 115 as well as the adjacent α-helices (helix 6 and helix 7) from EF-hands III and IV. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues in the loop show that three residues, glycine 113, glutamate 114, and leucine 116 are essential for methylation. In addition, subdomain (individual helix or Ca2+ binding loop) exchange mutants show that the substitutions of either helix 6 (EF-hand III) with helix 2 (EF-hand I) or helix 7 (EF-hand IV) with helix 3 (EF-hand II) compromises methylation. Charge-to-alanine mutations in helix 7 show that substitution of conserved charged residues at positions 118, 120, 122, 126, and 127 reduced lysine 115 methylation rates, suggesting possible electrostatic interactions between this helix and the methyltransferase. Single substitutions in helix 6 did not affect calmodulin methylation, suggesting this region may play a more indirect role in stabilizing the conformation of the methyltransferase recognition sequence.

Calmodulin is a highly conserved calcium sensor protein that modulates the activities of multiple enzymes. Calmodulin is a monomer consisting of two structurally similar globular calcium binding lobes (1.Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) connected by a flexible linker region (2.Persechini A. Kretsinger R.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5269-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Each lobe consists of two helix-loop-helix EF-hand calcium binding sites, with EF-hand domains I and II constituting the amino-terminal lobe and EF-hands III and IV constituting the carboxyl-terminal lobe. Many naturally occurring calmodulins are posttranslationally trimethylated on a single lysine residue at position 115 (reviewed in Ref. 4.Siegel F.L. Vincent P.L. Neal T.L. Wright L.S. Heth A.A. Rowe P.M. Paik W.K. Kim S. Protein Methylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 33-58Google Scholar). Lysine 115 is a solvent-exposed residue that is found on a highly conserved six-amino acid loop-turn region (LGEKLT) located between helix 6 of EF-hand III and helix 7 of EF-hand IV (Fig. 1). Trimethylation of calmodulin at lysine 115 is catalyzed by an N-methyltransferase that utilizes S-adenosylmethionine as a co-substrate (Refs. 5.Rowe P.M. Wright L.S. Siegel F.L. J. Biol.

Protein Methylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 33-58Google Scholar). This enzyme appears to have the dedicated function of trimethylating lysine 115 in calmodulin from a wide variety of species. From a functional perspective, calmodulin methylation selectively affects the regulation of certain enzymes such as NAD kinase (10.Roberts D.M. Rowe P.M. Siegel F.L. Lukas T.J. Watterson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1491-1494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Roberts D.M. Besl L. Oh S.H. Masterson R.V. Schell J. Stacey G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and might also influence posttranslational ubiquitination of the protein (13.Gregori L. Marriott D. West C.M. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5232-5235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Previous work shows that the site on calmodulin recognized by the calmodulin N-methyltransferase resides solely on the COOH-terminal lobe (residues 78–148) (7.Han C.H. Richardson J. Oh S.H. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13974-13980Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Mutations or chemical modifications that affect the hydrophobic core and conformation of calmodulin disrupt methylation (7.Han C.H. Richardson J. Oh S.H. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13974-13980Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 14.Han C.H. Roberts D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 904-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and it seems as if the enzyme requires more than a linear sequence of amino acids or the simple surface exposure of lysine 115 for recognition and methylation.An examination of the calmodulin structure shows that the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal lobes share remarkable structural similarity and symmetry (1.Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). In previous work we performed a series of domain duplication and exchange mutagenesis experiments in which EF-hands III and IV were substituted with the symmetry-related EF-hands I and II (15.Cobb J.A. Han C.H. Wills D.M. Roberts D.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 417-424PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments showed that structural features unique to both EF-hands are required for methyltransferase binding and methylation. To define more precisely the regions responsible for calmodulin methyltransferase specificity, we exploited this domain exchange approach further and performed site-directed mutagenesis of various residues in the carboxyl-terminal lobe surrounding the methylation site. The results implicate specific regions in the methylation loop/turn region between EF-hands III and IV as well as residues within the adjacent α-helices in the binding and recognition of the enzyme.DISCUSSIONCalmodulin is trimethylated at lysine 115 with a high degree of specificity by a dedicated calmodulin lysineN-methyltransferase. In the present study, domain exchange and scanning mutagenesis were done to attempt to identify regions of the protein that contribute to this specificity. The results suggest that three structural regions within the carboxyl-terminal lobe appear to be involved: the highly conserved six-amino acid loop-turn region that contains lysine 115 as well as the adjacent α-helices (helix 6 and 7) from EF-hands III and IV.The six-amino acid methylation loop (LGEKLT) is highly conserved among phylogenetically diverse calmodulins, and it is reasonable to suggest that its structure provides features necessary for calmodulin methyltransferase recognition. Structural studies suggest that the loop shows greater flexibility and dynamics compared with the calcium binding loops and helices of the EF-hands (22.Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 23.Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 24.Malmendal A. Evenas J. Forsen S. Akke M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 883-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The loop provides a 90° hairpin turn between EF-hands III and IV, which is facilitated by Gly-113 (φ/ψ = 93°/10° (22.Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar)), and its conformation is stabilized by three hydrogen bonds between the backbone amide nitrogens of Gly-113 and Glu-114 and the backbone carbonyl oxygens of Met-109 and Thr-110 in helix 6 of EF-hand III (22.Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In addition, Leu-116 is imbedded in the core of the carboxyl-terminal lobe, forming hydrophobic interactions with residues on the hydrophobic faces of the helices from EF-hands III and IV (1.Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Glu-114 and Lys-115 are solvent-exposed charged residues with no apparent contacts with other parts of the calmodulin structure (Fig. 5).Calmodulin methylation is exquisitely sensitive to the substitutions of G113S, E114A, and L116T, which essentially abolish the methylation of lysine 115. These defects were observed regardless of calcium concentration, and thus, both the recognition of calcium-bound as well as apo-calmodulin was affected. Based on the structural features of these residues discussed above, some potential roles in methyltransferase recognition can be suggested. The substitution of glutamate 114 with an alanine removes a surface negative charge adjacent to the site of methylation and, as discussed further below, could provide an electrostatic contact for the enzyme. The substitution of a serine for the highly conserved glycine 113 likely alters the conformational flexibility of the loop-turn structure and might prohibit the residues within the loop from adopting an orientation suitable for methyltransferase binding and catalysis. The substitution of L116T, which is one of 14 residues composing the hydrophobic core of the carboxyl-terminal lobe, could alter the packing of the hydrophobic side chains and the interaction of the methylation loop with the hydrophobic core. Interestingly, none of these mutations significantly affects activation of two calmodulin-dependent enzymes, suggesting that their structural effects are subtle, selectively affecting methyltransferase recognition but not other calmodulin functions.The conserved residues of the methylation loop are not in themselves adequate to confer methylation. For example, previous work (15.Cobb J.A. Han C.H. Wills D.M. Roberts D.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 417-424PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the introduction of the methylation loop at a symmetrical position within the amino-terminal lobe did not result in lysine methylation. Furthermore, the replacement of either EF-hand III or IV with the homologous EF-hand I or II also results in the loss of lysine methylation (15.Cobb J.A. Han C.H. Wills D.M. Roberts D.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 417-424PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we find that the critical regions are the α-helices adjacent to the methylation site, helix 6 of EF-hand III and helix 7 of EF-hand IV.The substitution of helix 2 (LGTVMRS) for helix 6 (LRHVMTN) resulted in a substantial reduction in the rate of lysine methylation in both the presence and absence of calcium. A comparison of the structure of these related regions shows that they have remarkably similar backbone structures and form nearly identical packing interactions in their respective helical bundles within the amino or carboxyl termini (1.Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 23.Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar,25.Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of methylation was thought to be the result of alterations of surface residues that presumably interact with the methyltransferase. However, individual charge-to-neutral substitutions at these positions showed essentially normal methylation. Thus, the conservation of these surface residues is not apparently required for methyltransferase activity; however, the packing interactions of helix 6 with others in the carboxyl-terminal lobe may be important for stabilizing the conformation of the residues that are recognized and bound by the methyltransferase. The substitution of helix 2 apparently perturbs these interactions, a result that was not anticipated based on the similarity of the two structures. The reason for this defect in CaMH6 is not yet clear.In contrast, helix 7 shows a much different influence on the methylation of lysine 115. This helix introduces a high density of electrostatic charge on the carboxyl-terminal lobe (21.Weber P.C. Lukas T.J. Craig T.A. Wilson E. King M.M. Kwiatkowski A.P. Watterson D.M. Proteins. 1989; 6: 70-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) adjacent to the site of methylation (Fig. 5). Mutagenesis of these various charged groups show that the removal of charges at positions 118 and 120 and to a lesser degree from positions 122, 126, and 127 results in a reduction in the rate of methylation. These findings along with the E114A results discussed above suggest that electrostatic interactions may play a role in the binding of the methyltransferase.Interestingly, many of the defects associated with the substitutions within helix 7 apparently are more severe in apoCaM compared with Ca2+-CaM. Additionally, other mutations, such as the L112T substitution within the methylation loop, are only defective in apoCaM. This difference in the recognition of apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM by the calmodulin methyltransferase is supported by several previous findings. For example, the methylation of apoCaM shows different kinetics and considerably greater sensitivity to conditions of increasing ionic strength than Ca2+-CaM (7.Han C.H. Richardson J. Oh S.H. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13974-13980Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Conversely, the methylation of Ca2+-CaM, but not apoCaM, is sensitive to peptides and ligands that bind to the hydrophobic cleft (7.Han C.H. Richardson J. Oh S.H. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13974-13980Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 8.Pech L.L. Nelson D.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12737-12743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The inability of the cam2 mutant of Paramecium to be methylated normally in vivo (26.Lukas T.J. Friedman M.W. Kung C. Watterson D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7331-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was found to be due to an inability to selectively recognize the apo form of calmodulin (14.Han C.H. Roberts D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 904-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Thus, although both Ca2+- and apoCaM are trimethylated by the calmodulin methyltransferase, they interact with the enzyme in a distinct fashion.Based on these previous studies and the present mutagenesis work, we propose a model for the interaction of the methyltransferase with the two forms of calmodulin (Fig. 5). ApoCaM exists predominantly in a closed conformation consisting of the four α-helices of the EF-hand pair packed in an antiparallel (128°-137°) orientation relative to one another (23.Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 25.Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). This results in fewer exposed hydrophobic residues and a high density of surface charge residues (Fig. 5). Based on the charge substitutions, electrostatic interactions between the methyltransferase and the charged residues of helix 7 and the methylation loop of apoCaM may help contribute to binding/orientation of the calmodulin substrate. This supports previous findings that the interaction of apoCaM with the calmodulin methyltransferase (7.Han C.H. Richardson J. Oh S.H. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13974-13980Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) is sensitive to ion concentrations. Interestingly, the interaction of apoCaM with other target proteins shows a similar sensitivity (27.Van Hooff C.O.M. De Graan P.N.E. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1789-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Baudier J. Deloume J.C. Van Dorsselaer A. Black D. Matthes H.W.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18161-18164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).The binding of calcium induces a conformational change in the lobe, resulting in a shift of the EF-hand interhelical angles to an almost perpendicular state (86°-101°). Although the relative conformation of helix 6-methylation loop helix 7 (residues 106–126) undergoes a small change between apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM (root mean square deviation is 2.6 Å), the major change between the two structures is the surface exposure of a pronounced hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the site of methylation (Fig. 5). This surface might provide additional interactions with the methyltransferase. This could explain why reagents such as drugs and peptides, which interact selectively with the hydrophobic cleft, block the binding of the methyltransferase to Ca2+-CaM but not to apoCaM (7.Han C.H. Richardson J. Oh S.H. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13974-13980Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this could also help explain why several of the charge-to-alanine mutations have less severe effects on calmodulin methylation in the presence of calcium. Calmodulin is a highly conserved calcium sensor protein that modulates the activities of multiple enzymes. Calmodulin is a monomer consisting of two structurally similar globular calcium binding lobes (1.Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) connected by a flexible linker region (2.Persechini A. Kretsinger R.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5269-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Each lobe consists of two helix-loop-helix EF-hand calcium binding sites, with EF-hand domains I and II constituting the amino-terminal lobe and EF-hands III and IV constituting the carboxyl-terminal lobe. Many naturally occurring calmodulins are posttranslationally trimethylated on a single lysine residue at position 115 (reviewed in Ref. 4.Siegel F.L. Vincent P.L. Neal T.L. Wright L.S. Heth A.A. Rowe P.M. Paik W.K. Kim S. Protein Methylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 33-58Google Scholar). Lysine 115 is a solvent-exposed residue that is found on a highly conserved six-amino acid loop-turn region (LGEKLT) located between helix 6 of EF-hand III and helix 7 of EF-hand IV (Fig. 1). Trimethylation of calmodulin at lysine 115 is catalyzed by an N-methyltransferase that utilizes S-adenosylmethionine as a co-substrate (Refs. 5.Rowe P.M. Wright L.S. Siegel F.L. J. Biol.

Protein Methylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 33-58Google Scholar). This enzyme appears to have the dedicated function of trimethylating lysine 115 in calmodulin from a wide variety of species. From a functional perspective, calmodulin methylation selectively affects the regulation of certain enzymes such as NAD kinase (10.Roberts D.M. Rowe P.M. Siegel F.L. Lukas T.J. Watterson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1491-1494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Roberts D.M. Besl L. Oh S.H. Masterson R.V. Schell J. Stacey G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1985; 260: 5232-5235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work shows that the site on calmodulin recognized by the calmodulin N-methyltransferase resides solely on the COOH-terminal lobe (residues 78–148) (7.Han C.H. Richardson J. Oh S.H. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13974-13980Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Mutations or chemical modifications that affect the hydrophobic core and conformation of calmodulin disrupt methylation (7.Han C.H. Richardson J. Oh S.H. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13974-13980Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 14.Han C.H. Roberts D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 904-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and it seems as if the enzyme requires more than a linear sequence of amino acids or the simple surface exposure of lysine 115 for recognition and methylation. An examination of the calmodulin structure shows that the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal lobes share remarkable structural similarity and symmetry (1.Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). In previous work we performed a series of domain duplication and exchange mutagenesis experiments in which EF-hands III and IV were substituted with the symmetry-related EF-hands I and II (15.Cobb J.A. Han C.H. Wills D.M. Roberts D.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 417-424PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments showed that structural features unique to both EF-hands are required for methyltransferase binding and methylation. To define more precisely the regions responsible for calmodulin methyltransferase specificity, we exploited this domain exchange approach further and performed site-directed mutagenesis of various residues in the carboxyl-terminal lobe surrounding the methylation site. The results implicate specific regions in the methylation loop/turn region between EF-hands III and IV as well as residues within the adjacent α-helices in the binding and recognition of the enzyme. DISCUSSIONCalmodulin is trimethylated at lysine 115 with a high degree of specificity by a dedicated calmodulin lysineN-methyltransferase. In the present study, domain exchange and scanning mutagenesis were done to attempt to identify regions of the protein that contribute to this specificity. The results suggest that three structural regions within the carboxyl-terminal lobe appear to be involved: the highly conserved six-amino acid loop-turn region that contains lysine 115 as well as the adjacent α-helices (helix 6 and 7) from EF-hands III and IV.The six-amino acid methylation loop (LGEKLT) is highly conserved among phylogenetically diverse calmodulins, and it is reasonable to suggest that its structure provides features necessary for calmodulin methyltransferase recognition. Structural studies suggest that the loop shows greater flexibility and dynamics compared with the calcium binding loops and helices of the EF-hands (22.Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 23.Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 24.Malmendal A. Evenas J. Forsen S. Akke M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 883-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The loop provides a 90° hairpin turn between EF-hands III and IV, which is facilitated by Gly-113 (φ/ψ = 93°/10° (22.Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar)), and its conformation is stabilized by three hydrogen bonds between the backbone amide nitrogens of Gly-113 and Glu-114 and the backbone carbonyl oxygens of Met-109 and Thr-110 in helix 6 of EF-hand III (22.Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In addition, Leu-116 is imbedded in the core of the carboxyl-terminal lobe, forming hydrophobic interactions with residues on the hydrophobic faces of the helices from EF-hands III and IV (1.Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Glu-114 and Lys-115 are solvent-exposed charged residues with no apparent contacts with other parts of the calmodulin structure (Fig. 5).Calmodulin methylation is exquisitely sensitive to the substitutions of G113S, E114A, and L116T, which essentially abolish the methylation of lysine 115. These defects were observed regardless of calcium concentration, and thus, both the recognition of calcium-bound as well as apo-calmodulin was affected. Based on the structural features of these residues discussed above, some potential roles in methyltransferase recognition can be suggested. The substitution of glutamate 114 with an alanine removes a surface negative charge adjacent to the site of methylation and, as discussed further below, could provide an electrostatic contact for the enzyme. The substitution of a serine for the highly conserved glycine 113 likely alters the conformational flexibility of the loop-turn structure and might prohibit the residues within the loop from adopting an orientation suitable for methyltransferase binding and catalysis. The substitution of L116T, which is one of 14 residues composing the hydrophobic core of the carboxyl-terminal lobe, could alter the packing of the hydrophobic side chains and the interaction of the methylation loop with the hydrophobic core. Interestingly, none of these mutations significantly affects activation of two calmodulin-dependent enzymes, suggesting that their structural effects are subtle, selectively affecting methyltransferase recognition but not other calmodulin functions.The conserved residues of the methylation loop are not in themselves adequate to confer methylation. For example, previous work (15.Cobb J.A. Han C.H. Wills D.M. Roberts D.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 417-424PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the introduction of the methylation loop at a symmetrical position within the amino-terminal lobe did not result in lysine methylation. Furthermore, the replacement of either EF-hand III or IV with the homologous EF-hand I or II also results in the loss of lysine methylation (15.Cobb J.A. Han C.H. Wills D.M. Roberts D.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 417-424PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we find that the critical regions are the α-helices adjacent to the methylation site, helix 6 of EF-hand III and helix 7 of EF-hand IV.The substitution of helix 2 (LGTVMRS) for helix 6 (LRHVMTN) resulted in a substantial reduction in the rate of lysine methylation in both the presence and absence of calcium. A comparison of the structure of these related regions shows that they have remarkably similar backbone structures and form nearly identical packing interactions in their respective helical bundles within the amino or carboxyl termini (1.Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 23.Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar,25.Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of methylation was thought to be the result of alterations of surface residues that presumably interact with the methyltransferase. However, individual charge-to-neutral substitutions at these positions showed essentially normal methylation. Thus, the conservation of these surface residues is not apparently required for methyltransferase activity; however, the packing interactions of helix 6 with others in the carboxyl-terminal lobe may be important for stabilizing the conformation of the residues that are recognized and bound by the methyltransferase. The substitution of helix 2 apparently perturbs these interactions, a result that was not anticipated based on the similarity of the two structures. The reason for this defect in CaMH6 is not yet clear.In contrast, helix 7 shows a much different influence on the methylation of lysine 115. This helix introduces a high density of electrostatic charge on the carboxyl-terminal lobe (21.Weber P.C. Lukas T.J. Craig T.A. Wilson E. King M.M. Kwiatkowski A.P. Watterson D.M. Proteins. 1989; 6: 70-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) adjacent to the site of methylation (Fig. 5). Mutagenesis of these various charged groups show that the removal of charges at positions 118 and 120 and to a lesser degree from positions 122, 126, and 127 results in a reduction in the rate of methylation. These findings along with the E114A results discussed above suggest that electrostatic interactions may play a role in the binding of the methyltransferase.Interestingly, many of the defects associated with the substitutions within helix 7 apparently are more severe in apoCaM compared with Ca2+-CaM. Additionally, other mutations, such as the L112T substitution within the methylation loop, are only defective in apoCaM. This difference in the recognition of apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM by the calmodulin methyltransferase is supported by several previous findings. For example, the methylation of apoCaM shows different kinetics and considerably greater sensitivity to conditions of increasing ionic strength than Ca2+-CaM (7.Han C.H. Richardson J. Oh S.H. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13974-13980Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Conversely, the methylation of Ca2+-CaM, but not apoCaM, is sensitive to peptides and ligands that bind to the hydrophobic cleft (7.Han C.H. Richardson J. Oh S.H. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13974-13980Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 8.Pech L.L. Nelson D.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12737-12743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The inability of the cam2 mutant of Paramecium to be methylated normally in vivo (26.Lukas T.J. Friedman M.W. Kung C. Watterson D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7331-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was found to be due to an inability to selectively recognize the apo form of calmodulin (14.Han C.H. Roberts D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 904-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Thus, although both Ca2+- and apoCaM are trimethylated by the calmodulin methyltransferase, they interact with the enzyme in a distinct fashion.Based on these previous studies and the present mutagenesis work, we propose a model for the interaction of the methyltransferase with the two forms of calmodulin (Fig. 5). ApoCaM exists predominantly in a closed conformation consisting of the four α-helices of the EF-hand pair packed in an antiparallel (128°-137°) orientation relative to one another (23.Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 25.Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). This results in fewer exposed hydrophobic residues and a high density of surface charge residues (Fig. 5). Based on the charge substitutions, electrostatic interactions between the methyltransferase and the charged residues of helix 7 and the methylation loop of apoCaM may help contribute to binding/orientation of the calmodulin substrate. This supports previous findings that the interaction of apoCaM with the calmodulin methyltransferase (7.Han C.H. Richardson J. Oh S.H. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13974-13980Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) is sensitive to ion concentrations. Interestingly, the interaction of apoCaM with other target proteins shows a similar sensitivity (27.Van Hooff C.O.M. De Graan P.N.E. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1789-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Baudier J. Deloume J.C. Van Dorsselaer A. Black D. Matthes H.W.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18161-18164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).The binding of calcium induces a conformational change in the lobe, resulting in a shift of the EF-hand interhelical angles to an almost perpendicular state (86°-101°). Although the relative conformation of helix 6-methylation loop helix 7 (residues 106–126) undergoes a small change between apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM (root mean square deviation is 2.6 Å), the major change between the two structures is the surface exposure of a pronounced hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the site of methylation (Fig. 5). This surface might provide additional interactions with the methyltransferase. This could explain why reagents such as drugs and peptides, which interact selectively with the hydrophobic cleft, block the binding of the methyltransferase to Ca2+-CaM but not to apoCaM (7.Han C.H. Richardson J. Oh S.H. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13974-13980Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this could also help explain why several of the charge-to-alanine mutations have less severe effects on calmodulin methylation in the presence of calcium. Calmodulin is trimethylated at lysine 115 with a high degree of specificity by a dedicated calmodulin lysineN-methyltransferase. In the present study, domain exchange and scanning mutagenesis were done to attempt to identify regions of the protein that contribute to this specificity. The results suggest that three structural regions within the carboxyl-terminal lobe appear to be involved: the highly conserved six-amino acid loop-turn region that contains lysine 115 as well as the adjacent α-helices (helix 6 and 7) from EF-hands III and IV.

Glu-114 and Lys-115 are solvent-exposed charged residues with no apparent contacts with other parts of the calmodulin structure (Fig. 5).

https://openalex.org/W1985016823,"To study the influence of disulfide bridge formation on the assembly of the subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells, dithiothreitol (DTT) was used to create a reducing milieu in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)in vivo. In the presence of 5 mm DTT during pulse-chase experiments all of the β-subunit precursors observed in unperturbed cells (pβ0, pβ1, pβ2, and β*) collapsed into the pβ0 form. The reducing milieu of the ER was reoxidized in less than 5 min after removal of DTT from the medium. DTT markedly increased the half-life of the pβ0 precursor from 8.8 to 65.2 min. Under reoxidation conditions, the β-subunit precursors folded back from pβ0 in less than 5 min. In unperturbed JEG-3 cells, the α-subunit was present in both fully glycosylated and monoglycosylated precursor (pre-α) forms. The attachment of the second N-linked glycan residue of the α-subunit was accelerated in the presence of DTT, and consequently pre-α-subunit was missing from the DTT-treated cultures. The formation of αβ-dimers appeared to be at least partially independent of the oxidation state in the ER. The αβ-dimer was present under conditions in which disulfide bridge formation was prevented by exposure to 5 mm DTT before and during the pulse period. This clearly suggests that the human chorionic gonadotropin subunits may acquire association-competent conformations even when no disulfide bridge formation has taken place. To study the influence of disulfide bridge formation on the assembly of the subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells, dithiothreitol (DTT) was used to create a reducing milieu in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)in vivo. In the presence of 5 mm DTT during pulse-chase experiments all of the β-subunit precursors observed in unperturbed cells (pβ0, pβ1, pβ2, and β*) collapsed into the pβ0 form. The reducing milieu of the ER was reoxidized in less than 5 min after removal of DTT from the medium. DTT markedly increased the half-life of the pβ0 precursor from 8.8 to 65.2 min. Under reoxidation conditions, the β-subunit precursors folded back from pβ0 in less than 5 min. In unperturbed JEG-3 cells, the α-subunit was present in both fully glycosylated and monoglycosylated precursor (pre-α) forms. The attachment of the second N-linked glycan residue of the α-subunit was accelerated in the presence of DTT, and consequently pre-α-subunit was missing from the DTT-treated cultures. The formation of αβ-dimers appeared to be at least partially independent of the oxidation state in the ER. The αβ-dimer was present under conditions in which disulfide bridge formation was prevented by exposure to 5 mm DTT before and during the pulse period. This clearly suggests that the human chorionic gonadotropin subunits may acquire association-competent conformations even when no disulfide bridge formation has taken place. endoplasmic reticulum human chorionic gonadotropin dithiothreitol Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium post-nuclear supernatant polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Secretory and membrane glycoproteins of eukaryotic cells are co-translationally translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 from where they travel to Golgi complex on the secretory pathway and to other destinations. Recently, it became evident that the transport of proteins out of the ER is limited by a unique “quality control” system that involves recognition and retention of misfolded or misassembled proteins. If further attempts of acquiring the correct folding fail, these proteins may be directed into a degradation pathway (1.Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev.

In the case of oligomeric proteins, the correct formation of disulfide bonds plays an important role in the assembly of secretory and membrane proteins (5.Machamer C.E. Doms R.W. Bole D.G.

The disulfide bonds are generated through oxidation in the ER. The ER lumen is unique among the various compartments in the eukaryotic cells because it provides an oxidizing environment for the disulfide bond formation with the help of the protein disulfide isomerase that promotes the disulfide bond formation (8.Freedman R.B. Cell. 1989; 57: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 9.Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that the co-translational disulfide bond formation, folding, and oligomerization of proteins within the ER can be reversibly inhibited by the addition of the disulfide bridge disrupting agent dithiothreitol (DTT) to living cells (10.Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 11.Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A.

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a glycoprotein hormone, is composed of two noncovalently linked and glycosylated α- and β-subunits (18.Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev.

Both subunits are transcribed from separate genes and assembled post-translationally in the ER. JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells not only secrete hCG but also an excess of free α- and a minor quantity of β-subunit (26.Cosgrove D.E. Campain J.A. Cox G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The α- and β-subunits are synthesized via precursors. Five β-subunit intermediates have been characterized (30.Huth J.R.

These intermediates represent discrete steps in the folding process that are apparently coupled with the formation of individual disulfide bonds (32.Bedows E. Huth J.R. Suganuma N. Bartels C.F. Boime I. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11655-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The disulfide bond formation seems to take place post-translationally (30.Huth J.R.

No attempt has yet been made to understand the effect of DTT on the biosynthesis of α- and β-hCG subunitsin vivo. Here, we communicate our investigations on the effect of prevention of the disulfide bridge formation in vivo by the use of DTT on the association of the α- and β-subunits. Moreover, we have studied the effect of reduction and reoxidation on the N-glycosylation of the α-subunit as well as on the maturation of the β-subunit. JEG-3 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) monolayer cultures were maintained in DMEM medium (Sigma), containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Linaris Corp., Bettingen, Germany). The medium was supplemented with 3.7 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Linaris Corp.). Confluent cell monolayers grown in 25-cm2plastic flasks (Nunc GmbH, Wiesbaden-Biebrich, Germany) were used for pulse labeling and chase experiments. Confluent (<95%) JEG-3 cells grown at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum were used for the pulse labeling and chase experiments. The cells, kept for 30 min in deficient medium (DMEM lacking cysteine and methionine) were pulse labeled (for time, see “Results”) with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys mixture (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and chased (for time, see “Results”) in the DMEM containing 5 mm excess of Met and Cys in the presence or absence of 5 mm DTT (as indicated below). After incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were chilled on ice and incubated for 5–10 min with ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl) containing 40 mm N-ethylmaleimide to prevent the rearrangement of -S-S- bonds by a blockade of the free thiol groups. The cells were again washed three times with the ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl lysis buffer, pH 7.6, containing 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1.0% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 20 mm EDTA, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was prepared by centrifugation of the lysate at 19,900 × g for 5 min (Biofuge 15, Heraeus, Osterode, Germany). To reduce the nonspecific coprecipitation, the PNS was precleared by shaking with protein A Staphylococcus aureuscells (Sigma; 100 μl cell suspension/1500 μl lysate) for 30 min at 4 °C. The S. aureus cells were pelleted for 5 min at 19,900 × g (Biofuge 15), and the supernatant was used for sequential immunoprecipitation by using two different anti-hCG antibodies as given below. Two different polyclonal antibodies against the hCG subunits were used in immunoprecipitation of cell lysate. The various β-subunit forms were purified by using an antibody (G10, kindly provided by Dr. E. Bedows, Omaha, NE) that recognizes all forms of free β and β-subunit precursors but does not cross-react with the α-subunit (33.Beebe J.S. Krzesicki R.F. Norton S.E. Perini F. Peters B.P. Ruddon R.W. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The fraction of the α-subunit being associated with the β-subunit in a dimer, however, is coprecipitated with this antibody. After depleting the PNS of the β-subunit, their precursors, and the αβ-dimer, the supernatant of the same PNS was used for subsequent immunoprecipitation with a goat anti-α-hCG antibody (34.Hilf G. Merz W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 35.Merz W.E. Erlewein C. Licht P. Harbarth P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation with each of the antibodies was carried out for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected on the protein A-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and washed three times with the lysis buffer and once with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8. The immune complexes were eluted by the addition of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 1% SDS) and heating of the samples for 1 min in a boiling water bath. Subsequently, the samples were centrifuged at 19,900 × g for 15 min, and aliquots of the supernatant were mixed with the equal volume of the nonreducing sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 4% (w/v) SDS, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 20% (v/v) glycerol) and reducing sample buffer (containing 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol), respectively. The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE (Mini-Protean II, Bio-Rad). In all gels, the14C-labeled molecular weight marker (Rainbow, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was run together with the samples. It contained myosine (M r = 220,000), phosphorylase b (M r = 97, 400), bovine serum albumin (M r = 66,000), ovalbumin (M r = 46,000), carbonic anhydrase (M r = 30,000), trypsin inhibitorM r = 21,500), lysozyme (M r = 14,300), aprotinin (M r = 6,500), insulin chain B (M r = 3,400), and insulin chain A (M r = 2,350) as molecular weight markers. Proteins were precipitated by incubation of the polyacrylamide gels in 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. After two washings (20 min each) in dimethyl sulfoxide, the gels were incubated in 22% (w/v) 2,5 diphenyloxazole (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) for 90 min with gentle shaking. After several washings with water, the gels were transferred to Whatman 3MM paper and dried in a gel dryer (Bio-Rad). The gels were exposed at −80 °C to x-ray film (Fuji RX) in the presence of an intensifying screen. The quantitative evaluation of the x-ray films was performed by laser densitometry (2202 Ultro scan, LKB) and computer-supported calculation of the band intensities of the fluorograms, or by the Kodak Digital Science one-dimensional system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some experiments, cells treated with 5 mm DTT prior to (5–40 min) as well as during the pulse (15 min) were lysed at the end of the pulse. The lysate was purified as described above, however, using three different monoclonal antibodies (INN-hCG-45, INN-hCG-53, and INN-hCG-55, kindly provided by Dr. P. Berger, Innsbruck, Austria) directed against epitopes that are exposed on hCG but not on the free subunits to assess the immunologic properties of the αβ-dimer formed in the presence of DTT. Three cultures of JEG-3 cells grown in 75-cm2 flasks were treated 45 min in Met/Cys-deficient DMEM medium (Sigma) prior to labeling with 88.3 MBq [35S]Met/Cys per flask for 45 min followed by 45 min of chase. The cells were rinsed five times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing each of 5 mm Met and Cys. Cell lysis, preparation of the post-nuclear supernatant, and preabsorption with the protein A S. aureus cells was performed as described above. 2 ml of the lysate were applied to a Sephadex G150 column (0.75 × 100 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.05% (w/v) SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 0.02% (w/v) Nonidet-P40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The column was run in a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. Fractions of 750 μl were collected, and 20 μl of aliquot of each fraction was counted in a Tricarb 2450 scintillation counter (Canberra Packard, Dreieich, Germany). The pooled fractions (see below) were purified by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above except that boiling of the unreduced samples was omitted. The electrophoresis was performed in duplicate. One gel for the preparation of a fluorogram. The other gel was exposed at 4 °C to a x-ray film (Fuji RX). The bands were excised, and the radioactive material was eluted by breaking up the gels in to small pieces with a glass rod and incubation overnight in reducing sample buffer as well as a freezing-thawing cycle. The eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The pulse-chase kinetics of the hCG-β-subunit, their intermediates, and the α-subunit contained in αβ-dimers is shown in Fig. 1. The band pattern is very similar as observed by others in the case of JAR cells (see below). At least four different precursor forms of the mature β-subunit can be discerned, designated as pβ0, pβ1, pβ2, and β*. The pβ0 form disappeared completely within the first 15 min of chase (Fig. 1 A). The pβ1 and pβ2 forms show higher apparent molecular weights (M r = 30,300 and 32,600, respectively) than pβ0 (M r = 25,200) in the SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Upon reduction of the samples prior to electrophoresis, all the β-subunit intermediates collapse into one band (Fig. 1 B) with the same apparent molecular weight as the pβ0 band (M r = 25,200). This suggests that the different electrophoretic mobilities of the precursors under unreduced conditions display differences in the number of disulfide bridges formed. Small amounts of a β-subunit with an apparent molecular weight of 36,900 (β*) emerged at a chase time of 30 min. The apparent molecular weight of this precursor form in the SDS-PAGE is almost identical with that of the mature hCG-β-subunit; however, β* showed an apparent molecular weight of 26,500 upon reduction. Moreover, the results also indicate that the observed β-subunit intermediates represent ER forms of the β-subunit that have not entered into a Golgi compartment where the O-glycan residues are attached. After this has taken place an apparent molecular weight of 37,500 is reached and maintained also in the presence of reducing agents (βmature). At the end of the pulse period (Fig.1 A, lane 2), a significant fraction of the α-subunit was coprecipitated by the anti-β antibody (G10), indicating that an αβ-dimer has already formed. The free α-subunit is not precipitated with G10. Experiments to find out the efficient DTT concentration needed to reduce the disulfide bridges of the hCG subunits in JEG-3 cells were performed in a range of 0.1- 20 mm DTT. A 5 mm concentration of DTT turned out to be completely sufficient to obtain the same picture of the subunit bands in the SDS-PAGE as after complete reduction of the sample with 1.3 m β-mercaptoethanol prior to electrophoresis (data not shown). We, therefore used a concentration of 5 mm DTT in the subsequent experiments. The cells were pulse labeled in the absence of DTT and subsequently chased in the presence of 5 mm DTT up to 240 min. The pulse labeled cells showed the presence of α-subunit (contained in αβ-dimers) and β-subunit intermediates (Fig. 2,lane 2). The pβ0 form was the prominent intermediate in the presence of DTT. Within a period of 5 min in the presence of DTT in the chase medium, a distinctly higher intensity of the pβ0 form (36.6 ± 13.0% (n = 4)versus 12.8 ± 1.2% (n = 5) in the absence of DTT; intensity of all β forms = 100%) was observed. Moreover, the pβ1 intermediate was missing in the presence of DTT. In a further series of experiments, the DTT treatment was performed during the pulse (15 min) and the first 15 min of chase. Fig.3 shows the results of a representative experiment. The reduced β-subunit form (pβ0) was the only β precursor observed as long as DTT was present. Remarkably, an α-subunit band was also visible in the anti-β precipitated samples (lanes 1 and 2), indicating the presence of αβ-dimer even under the reducing conditions in vivo. After 5 min of chase in a DTT-free medium, the β-subunit precursors seemed to be recovered and reoxidized (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). The band pattern seems to be the same as observed in the unperturbed cells. The supernatants of the samples preabsorbed with anti-β antibody (which removes αβ-dimers) were immunoprecipitated with an antibody that recognizes free α-subunit. No free α-subunit could be detected in the presence of DTT (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and2). This is due to the fact that the anti-α antibody used does not react with the completely reduced α-subunit. 2V. Singh and W. E. Merz, unpublished data. Within 5 min of DTT-free chase, the free α-subunit (α not contained in the αβ-dimer) had regained a conformation that was recognized by the anti-α antibody (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). The decrease of the intracellular α-subunit concentration in the later chase time (≥60 min) was due to the export of the free α-subunit via the secretory pathway into the culture medium (Fig. 3 C). Besides the mature free β-subunit (βm), a small amount of a β-subunit form with a lower apparent molecular weight (βf) was also secreted from DTT-treated cells (Fig.3 C). It might represent an immature β- or a degraded β-subunit. Gel filtration chromatography of the cell lysates of unperturbed JEG-3 cells was used to separate αβ-dimers from free subunits (Fig.4 A). The fractions were pooled as indicated and purified by immunoprecipitation as described above. The immune complexes were eluted from the protein A-Sepharose and applied to the SDS-PAGE with and without reduction of the samples (Fig.4 B). In the unreduced samples of the pooled fractions 1 and 2, the immune complexes were visible as a high molecular weight band that did not enter into the separating gel. Moreover two other bands (M r = 52,200 and M r = 37,700) were detected in the gel (Fig. 4 B, pool 2). After reduction, the α- and β-subunit bands were visible. Whereas the α-subunit present in the pool fractions 1 and 2 was coprecipitated with the β-subunit (as αβ-dimer), the bulk of the free α-subunit was eluted from the column in the fractions of pool 3 (Fig. 4 B, right panel). The inability of the anti-β antiserum to precipitate the free α-subunits is obvious from the Fig. 4 B (left panel). This shows clearly that the α-subunit eluted in the higher molecular weight fractions of pool 1 and 2 was indeed part of an αβ-dimer complex, whereas the free α-subunit was eluted later. We cut the individual bands of the unreduced samples from the gel and separated the eluted material again in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions to in identify the individual components of each band (Fig. 4 C). The immune complexes at the top of the gel dissociated into the same subunit band pattern as already seen in Fig. 4 B. The band withM r = 52,000 turned out to represent an αβ*-dimer, whereas the M r = 37,700 band consisted of α-pβ-dimers. In the pool fraction 3, in addition to the free α-subunit, a pre-α-band (see also below) was also clearly visible (Fig. 4 B). In the case of the αβ-dimers the pre-α-band was missing (Fig. 4 B, pool 2). In the free α-subunit fraction (after having removed αβ-dimers by immunoprecipitation), besides the regular α-subunit (M r = 20, 500), a molecular variant designated as pre-α was observed (apparent M r= 18,300; Fig. 5). It represents an α-subunit with only one of the two carbohydrate residues attached to the protein. Both α-subunit forms collapsed into one band with a molecular weight of 10,000 after digestion with peptideN-glycanase F (data not shown). Interestingly, the pre-α-subunit was missing in the DTT-treated JEG-3 cells (Fig.5 B). This seems to indicate the accelerated linkage of the second N-linked carbohydrate residue of the α-subunit when the disulfide bridges are not formed. In the case ofN-glycosylation of the β-subunit a similar process was not observed. We have studied the effect of a prevention of the disulfide bridge formation on the subunit association in hCG biosynthesis. This was achieved by shifting the oxidizing into a reducing milieu in the ER by means of DTT. The DTT concentrations used in the present investigation do not influence protein synthesis and translocation along the secretory pathway (36.Ibrahimi I. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1555-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the presence of DTT disulfide bridge formation is delayed and reinitiated post-translationally without a loss in efficiency after removal of DTT (11.Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The hCG contains as much as 11 disulfide bridges (five in the α-subunit and six in the β-subunit). The significance of the sequence of disulfide bridge formation for the folding and the association of the subunits is not yet fully elucidated. In this context the effect of a replacement in the β-subunit of individual pairs of cysteine by alanine residues was thoroughly studied (32.Bedows E. Huth J.R. Suganuma N. Bartels C.F. Boime I. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11655-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Bedows E. Norton S.E. Huth J.R. Suganuma N. Boime I. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10574-10580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This methodology is of great value. However, at least theoretically the possibility cannot be excluded that the elimination of single or even more disulfide bridges might have an impact on the conformation of the subunit as well as on the folding and association with the α-subunit. Reduction and reoxidation studies of the wild-type subunits in vivo by the use of DTT provides an independent way to study the interdependences between disulfide bridge formation, folding, subunit association, andN-glycosylation. In this publication, we have addressed the question whether disulfide bridge formation is an essential requirement for subunit association. To our knowledge, no experiments have been published carried out to study the in vivo effects of DTT on the hCG subunit folding pattern and subunit association. In unperturbed JEG-3 cells, the mature hCG-β-subunit is formed through well defined intermediates that seem to acquire distinct conformations that allow separation in the SDS-PAGE. Obviously these intermediates are defined by the formation of disulfide bridges (Fig. 1). These β-subunit precursors seem to resemble very closely or are even identical to the pattern observed and extensively studied in JAR cells (31.Huth J.R. Perini F. Lockridge O. Bedows E. Ruddon R.W.

In JAR cells, the following sequence of β-subunit intermediates, leading to a form that combines with the α-subunit, was described: pβ0 → pβ1early → pβ1late → pβ1early → pβ2free → pβ2combined-early → pβ2combined-late(30.Huth J.R.
