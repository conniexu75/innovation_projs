https://openalex.org/W1759896623,"Glucose stimulation of insulin release involves metabolism of the sugar and elevation of cytoplasmic calcium (Ca2+i) in pancreatic B-cells. We compared the dynamic changes of metabolism (fluorescence of endogenous reduced pyridine nucleotides, NAD(P)H), membrane potential (intracellular microelectrodes), and Ca2+i (fura-2 technique), in intact mouse islets. Glucose (15 mM) sequentially triggered an increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence, a depolarization with electrical activity, and a rise in Ca2+i. The change in NAD(P)H was monophasic and regular, whereas the changes in membrane potential and Ca2+i were multiphasic, with steady-state regular oscillations of similar average frequencies (about 2.2/min). Digital image analysis revealed that Ca2+i oscillations were synchronous in all regions of the islets. Omission of extracellular Ca2+ abolished the rise in Ca2+i but not the increase in NAD(P)H. Both electrical and Ca2+i oscillations disappeared in low external Ca2+ (1 mM), and became larger but slower in high Ca2+ (10 mM). Sustained depolarization (by tolbutamide, arginine, or high K+) and hyperpolarization (by diazoxide) of B-cells caused sustained increases and decreases of Ca2+i, respectively. In conclusion, the changes in membrane potential induced by various secretagogues trigger synchronous changes in Ca2+i in all B-cells of the islets. The oscillatory pattern of the electrical and Ca2+i responses induced by glucose is not accompanied by and thus probably not due to similar oscillations of metabolism."

The membrane-associated proteoglycans were solubilized from these monolayers with detergent and purified by ion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q, incorporation in liposomes, and gel filtration. The liposome-intercalated proteoglycans were 125I-iodinated and treated with heparitinase before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radio-labeled proteins with apparent molecular masses of 130, 60, 46, 35, and 30 kDa (HAEC) and 180, 130, 62, 43, and 35 kDa (HUVEC) were detected by autoradiography. Further characterization by affinity chromatography on immobilized monoclonal antibodies and by Northern blot analysis provided evidence for the expression of syndecan, glypican, and fibroglycan in human endothelial cells. Most of the heparan sulfate which accumulated in the subendothelial matrix was implanted on a 400-kDa core protein. This protein was immunologically related to perlecan and bound to fibronectin. Binding studies on immobilized antithrombin III suggested that all membrane-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycan forms had the capacity to bind to antithrombin III but that high affinity binding was more typical for glypican. Most of the proteoglycans isolated from the extracellular matrix also bound only with low affinity to antithrombin III. These results imply that glypican may specifically contribute to the antithrombotic properties of the vascular wall."
https://openalex.org/W1601050661,"Abstract The clpB gene in Escherichia coli encodes a heat-shock protein that is a close homolog of the clpA gene product. The latter is the ATPase subunit of the multimeric ATP-dependent protease Ti (Clp) in E. coli, which also contains the 21-kDa proteolytic subunit (ClpP). The clpB gene product has been purified to near homogeneity by DEAE-Sepharose and heparin-agarose column chromatographies. The purified ClpB consists of a major 93-kDa protein and a minor 79-kDa polypeptide as analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Upon gel filtration on a Superose-6 column, it behaves as a 350-kDa protein. Thus, ClpB appears to be a tetrameric complex of the 93-kDa subunit. The purified ClpB has ATPase activity which is stimulated 5-10-fold by casein. It is also activated by insulin, but not by other proteins, including globin and denatured bovine serum albumin. ClpB cleaves adenosine 5'-(alpha,beta-methylene)-triphosphate as rapidly as ATP, but not adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylene)-triphosphate. GTP, CTP, and UTP are hydrolyzed 15-25% as well as ATP. ADP strongly inhibits ATP hydrolysis with a Ki of 34 microM. ClpB has a Km for ATP of 1.1 mM, and casein increases its Vmax for ATP without affecting its Km. A Mg2+ concentration of 3 mM is necessary for half-maximal ATP hydrolysis. Mn2+ supports ATPase activity as well as Mg2+, and Ca2+ has about 20% their activity. Anti-ClpB antiserum does not cross-react with ClpA nor does anti-ClpA antiserum react with ClpB. In addition, ClpB cannot replace ClpA in supporting the casein-degrading activity of ClpP. Thus, ClpB is distinct from ClpA in its structural and biochemical properties despite the similarities in their sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1588727306,"Iron is required for the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. High concentrations of iron, however, are toxic, forcing this yeast to tightly regulate its concentration of intracellular free iron. We demonstrate that S. cerevisiae accumulates iron through the combined action of a plasma membrane ferrireductase and an Fe(II) transporter. This transporter is highly selective for Fe(II). Several other transition metals did not inhibit iron uptake when these metals were present at a concentration 100-fold higher than the Km (0.15 microM) for iron transport. Pt(II) inhibited ferrireductase activity but not the ability of cells to transport iron that was chemically reduced to Fe(II). Incubation of cells in a synthetic iron-limited media resulted in the induction of both ferrireductase and Fe(II) transporter activities. In complex media, Fe(II) transport activity was regulated in response to media iron concentration, while the activity of the ferrireductase was not. When stationary phase cells were inoculated into fresh media, ferrireductase activity increased independent of the iron content of the media; in contrast, transporter activity varied inversely with iron levels. These results demonstrate that the ferrireductase and Fe(II) transporter are separately regulated and that iron accumulation may be limited by changes in either activity."
https://openalex.org/W1605519347,"An important means by which tumor cells influence the vasculature is through the production of soluble mediators altering vascular properties. A approximately 22-kDa polypeptide was purified to homogeneity from conditioned medium of murine methylcholanthrene A (meth A) fibrosarcoma cells by ion-exchange chromatography and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), based on its ability to induce tissue factor procoagulant activity in endothelial cells (ECs). The final product migrated as a broad band on reduced and nonreduced SDS-PAGE and had an unique amino-terminal sequence. This meth A-derived polypeptide modulated EC coagulant properties through the induction of tissue factor, induced monocyte migration and tissue factor expression, and was also chemotactic for granulocytes. Injection of the polypeptide into mouse footpads resulted in an inflammatory response with tissue swelling and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration. The ability of this mediator to activate ECs and monocytes has led us to name it EMAP II (endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide). EMAP II is distinct from a previously described approximately 40-kDa meth A-derived polypeptide termed EMAP I. Through its potential to activate host effector mechanisms, EMAP II could contribute to the biology of immunogenic tumors, such as the meth A fibrosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W1490442168,"The ability of strong-binding myosin heads to activate the thin filament was investigated by incubating skinned single muscle fibers with N-ethylmaleimide-(NEM) modified myosin subfragment-1 (S1). Isometric force was influenced in a complex manner: during maximal calcium activation, NEM-S1 inhibited force with half-maximal inhibition at 20 microM while at submaximal calcium, NEM-S1 potentiated force with greatest effect at 6 microM. When fibers were treated with NEM-S1 (4-8 microM), the tension-pCa (-log [Ca2+]) relationship became less steep (i.e. the Hill coefficient decreased from 5.4 to 3.0 upon treatment with NEM-S1), but the midpoint was unchanged. These results support the idea that strong binding of intrinsic heads contributes to the cooperativity observed in Ca2+ activation of force. The NEM-S1-induced increase in force at low Ca2+ was associated with an acceleration of a kinetic transition, and this transition was activated to near maximum while force was not. The rate of force redevelopment following restretch (ktr) at submaximal calcium was increased by NEM-S1 in a concentration-dependent manner, yielding a maximum rate at low [Ca2+] which was similar to that observed during full activation. The effects of NEM-S1 on force and ktr indicate that strong-binding myosin cross-bridges are involved in activation of the thin filament."
https://openalex.org/W1942655272,"We studied mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities during the cell cycle of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using site-specific antibodies against extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1, a 44-kDa MAPK (Boulton, T.G., Yancopoulos, G.D., Gregory, J.S., Slauer, C., Moomaw, C., Hsu, J., and Cobb, M.H. (1990) Science 249, 64-67). These antibodies detected two distinct MAPKs (44- and 42-kDa MAPKs) in CHO cells. CHO cells were arrested at metaphase in the M phase by treatment with nocodazole, and activities of MAPKs were analyzed at specific time points after release from arrest. Immune complex kinase assay and renaturation and phosphorylation assay in substrate-containing gel revealed that both 44- and 42-kDa MAPKs had activities in the G1 through S and G2/M phases and were activated biphasically, in the G1 phase and around the M phase. MAPKs were inactivated in metaphase-arrested cells. The amount of MAPKs did not change significantly in the cell cycle. In the G1, S, and G2/M phases, MAPKs were phosphorylated on both tyrosine and threonine residues and dephosphorylated in metaphase-arrested cells. Our data suggest that MAPKs may play some role in the cell cycle other than G0/G1 transition."
https://openalex.org/W1570512758,"Transfer genes of the IncP plasmid RP4 are grouped in two separate regions, designated Tra1 and Tra2. Tra2 gene products are proposed to be mainly responsible for the formation of mating pairs in conjugating cells. To provide information relevant to understanding the function of Tra2 gene products, the nucleotide sequence of the entire RP4 Tra2 region is presented here. Twelve open reading frames were identified in the Tra2 core region, being essential for intraspecific Escherichia coli matings. Predicted sizes of 11 of the 12 Tra2 polypeptides could be verified by expression in E. coli. Based on hydropathy plot analysis, most of the Tra2 open reading frames encode proteins that may interact with membranes. Interestingly, six of the predicted Tra2 gene products exhibited significant sequence similarities to gene products encoded by the VirB operon of the Agrobacterium Ti plasmid. VirB proteins are thought to function in the formation of a transmembrane structure that mediates the passage of T-DNA molecules from bacteria into plant cells. Because of this analogy and the hydropathy of Tra2 gene products, we assume that the DNA transfer machineries acting in bacterial conjugation and T-DNA transfer are structurally and functionally similar. Therefore, the data presented here, support the hypothesis that Ti vir and IncP tra genes evolved from a common ancestor. This suggestion is favored by previous findings of sequence similarities between the IncP and Ti DNA transfer system."
https://openalex.org/W1496653214,"Fusion of influenza viruses with target membranes is induced by acid and involves complex changes in the viral fusion protein hemagglutinin (HA) and in the contact sites between viruses and target membranes (Stegmann, T., White, J. M., and Helenius, A. (1990) EMBO J. 9, 4231-4241). At 0 degrees C, in a first, kinetically distinct step, target membranes irreversibly adhere to the viruses. Fusion itself starts only after a lag-phase of several minutes (X-31 strain viruses) or after raising the temperature (PR8/34 strain viruses). We now provide evidence that the initial conformational change resulting in virus-target membrane adhesion is restricted to a (minor) subpopulation of the HA molecules. These molecules become susceptible to bromelain digestion, and they could be labeled with the photoactivatable reagent [3H]PTPC/11, a nonexchangeable lipid present in the target lipid bilayer (Harter, C., Bachi, T., Semenza, G., and Brunner, J. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 1856-1864). Only the HA2 subunit was labeled, and analyses of 2-nitro-5-thio-cyanobenzoic acid fragments derived thereof indicate that the HA2 NH2-terminal segment (fusion peptide) inserted into the target membrane bilayer. When the temperature was raised to trigger fusion of PR8/34 viruses, labeling of HA2 increased by a factor of 130. Most (74%) of that label was incorporated into the COOH-terminal membrane anchor region, but there was also a strong increase (about 30-fold) of NH2-terminal fusion peptide labeling. This suggests that fusion is preceded., or accompanied, by further changes in HA which lead to additional extensive lipid insertions of HA2 fusion peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1507155737,"The gene encoding human tear prealbumin, a major component of the protein fraction of tear fluid, was cloned from total cDNA of lacrimal gland by polymerase chain reaction using synthetic oligonucleotides derived from N-terminal amino acid sequences of the purified protein. Sequence analysis and a computer-assisted homology search revealed this protein to be a member of the lipocalin superfamily, consisting of hydrophobic-ligand carriers. The deduced amino acid sequence of tear prealbumin shares 58% identity with von Ebner's gland protein from rat, which is supposed to be involved in taste reception. In addition, significant homology has also been found with other members of the lipocalins, e.g. with beta-lactoglobulin. The predicted secondary structure of tear prealbumin resembles that of beta-lactoglobulin in the number and positions of nine beta-sheets and one alpha-helix at the C-terminal part of the protein, thus indicating a three-dimensional structure similar to beta-lactoglobulin. Protein sequencing revealed that the observed electrophoretic heterogeneity of tear prealbumin is due to subtle differences at the N terminus of the protein. The function of tear prealbumin as a lipophilic carrier was further supported by the fact that it binds [3H]retinol in vitro. Although this protein was originally described to be tear-specific, a tear prealbumin-specific antiserum also reacted with proteins of human saliva, sweat, and nasal mucus."
https://openalex.org/W1489669524,"gadd153 is a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-related gene whose expression is induced in response to growth arrest and DNA damage. This investigation explored the possibility that Ca2+ might play a role in regulating expression of gadd 153. We have demonstrated that treatment of HeLa cells with the calcium ionophores A23187 and ionomycin leads to the induction of gadd153 mRNA. The induction was rapid; increases in mRNA were detected by 90 min of treatment, and near maximum levels were achieved within 5-h exposure to A23187. Elevated mRNA levels resulted from both an increase in the rate of gadd153 transcription and an increase in the stability of the gadd153 mRNA. The response was not dependent on protein kinase C nor was it coupled to c-fos expression. Buffering intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ by combined treatment with BAPTA-AM (acetoxymethyl ester form of bis(aminophenoxy)ethane N,N'-tetraacetic acid) and EGTA prevented the induction of gadd153 mRNA by A23187. In addition, these treatments prevented the induction of gadd153 mRNA in response to the DNA damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate. We conclude that intracellular Ca2+ plays a role in regulating gadd153 expression. More specifically, Ca2+ likely plays a role in the induction of gadd153 mRNA following DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W1529087905,"The activity of p34cdc2 kinase is regulated in the phases of vertebrate cell cycle by mechanisms of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. In this paper, we demonstrate that casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylates p34cdc2 in vivo and in vitro at Ser39 during the G1 phase of HeLa cell division cycle. Human p34cdc2 shows a typical phosphorylation sequence motif site for CKII at Ser39 (ES39EEE). In our experiments, either p34cdc2 expressed and purified from bacteria or p34cdc2 immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells enriched in G1 by elutriation were substrates for in vitro phosphorylation by CKII. Phosphoamino acid analysis, N-chlorosuccinimide mapping, and two-dimensional tryptic mapping of p34cdc2 phosphorylated in vitro were performed to determine the phosphorylation site. A synthetic peptide spanning residues 33-50 of human p34cdc2, including the CKII site, was used to map the site. In addition, phosphorylation at Ser39 also occurs in vivo, since p34cdc2 is phosphorylated during G1 on serine, and its two-dimensional tryptic map shows two phosphopeptides that comigrate exactly with the synthetic peptides used as standard."
https://openalex.org/W1550381567,"Selective immunoisolation of P53 from Sf9 cells coexpressing wild-type P53 and casein kinase II yielded a preparation containing casein kinase II, thus suggesting that the two proteins may associate in a molecular complex in the intact cell. Such a complex could indeed be demonstrated in vitro between purified recombinant P53 and oligomeric casein kinase II and was shown to dissociate when P53 became phosphorylated by the kinase. This suggested that the P53 C-terminal domain, which contains the casein kinase II phosphorylation site was involved in the protein-protein interaction; this was confirmed by the fact that an anti-P53 monoclonal antibody directed to that domain inhibited the P53-casein kinase II association. Studies with isolated recombinant casein kinase II subunits disclosed that although the alpha (catalytic) subunit could phosphorylate P53, the formation of a stable P53-casein kinase II association required the presence of the beta subunit of the kinase. This was confirmed by immunoisolation of a P53-beta subunit complex from cells expressing both polypeptides. Although the biological significance of a reversible P53-casein kinase II molecular complex in the control of cell proliferation processes remains to be defined, these observations suggest the possibility of a novel mechanism regulating P53 and casein kinase II activities in the intact cell."
https://openalex.org/W1544919124,"Seven types of mRNA for choline acetyltransferase that differ in the 5'-noncoding region were identified in the mouse spinal cord by cDNA cloning and polymerase chain reaction. Among these transcripts, the M-type mRNA corresponding to the previously cloned mouse cDNA was most abundant in the spinal cord of mouse. A mouse genomic DNA clone containing the 5'-region of choline acetyltransferase mRNA was isolated and sequenced. Comparison of the sequences between the cDNAs and the genomic DNA revealed that the different mRNA species were transcribed from different promoter regions and produced by differential splicing. Two murine cholinergic cell lines, NS20Y and NG108-15, were shown to express the M-type mRNA almost exclusively, and were therefore used to study transcription of M-type mRNA. Fragments of the 5'-region of choline acetyltransferase gene were ligated with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and introduced into cultured cells. The fragment from -2752 to +46, which contained the M-type exon, a TATA-box like element upstream of the M-type exon, and the downstream intron, induced a significant expression of CAT activity in neuronal but not in non-neuronal cell lines. This result indicates that this region of choline acetyltransferase gene contains elements that regulate neuron-specific expression of choline acetyltransferase activity. However, there was no parallel correlation between reporter gene expression in the transfected cells and intrinsic choline acetyltransferase activity in these neuronal cell lines. Possible mechanisms that would explain this observation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1537883814,"We have used a serum from a patient with Sjogren's syndrome containing high titer (100,000) anti-Golgi autoantibodies and lower titer (20,000) anti-nuclear autoantibodies to characterize the Golgi complex. The Sjogren's syndrome serum immunoprecipitated a number of components of molecular mass 35-230 kDa from detergent extracts of [35S]methionine-labeled HeLa cells; at high dilution, the serum precipitated one major 230-kDa component. Using the Sjogren's syndrome serum, cDNA clones encoding the Golgi autoantigen were isolated from a lambda gt11 HeLa cell cDNA library. Autoantibodies from the Sjogren's syndrome serum, affinity purified from a recombinant bacterial fusion protein generated from one of the cDNA clones, showed Golgi staining of human, mouse, and chicken cells by immunofluorescence. The purified autoantibodies immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted a 230-kDa component. A rabbit antiserum raised to the recombinant fusion protein specifically stained the Golgi complex by immunofluorescence and reacted with a 230-kDa protein by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The 230-kDa protein was recovered in both the 100,000 x g sedimentable and soluble fractions in cell lysates and in the aqueous phase of Triton X-114 extracts. The 230-kDa autoantigen was dissociated from the Golgi complex by 15-min brefeldin A treatment, dissociation kinetics similar to that of mannosidase II. However, unlike mannosidase II, autoantigen staining was markedly reduced after drug treatment. Removal of brefeldin A resulted in reassociation of the autoantigen with the Golgi complex. The epitopes recognized by the affinity purified human and rabbit antibodies were ultrastructurally localized to the cytosolic face of one side of the Golgi stack, probably the trans-face. Taken together, the 230-kDa protein is a conserved, peripheral membrane component specifically associated with one Golgi compartment. We suggest that this peripheral Golgi protein may have a role in the compartment-specific structural organization of the Golgi or in sorting and transport of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1563817153,"The MAK3 gene is necessary for propagation of the L-A double-stranded RNA virus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. MAK3 encodes a protein with substantial homology to the Escherichia coli rimI N-acetyltransferase that acetylates the NH2 terminus of ribosomal protein S18, and shares consensus sequences with a group of N-acetyltransferases. The NH2 terminus of the viral major coat protein encoded by L-A is normally blocked, but we find that it is unblocked in a mak3-1 mutant. L-A virus-encoded proteins produced from a cDNA clone of L-A can encapsidate the L-A (+)-strands in a wild-type host, but not in a mak3-1 mutant strain. The amount of major coat protein found in the particle fraction is reduced greater than 100-fold, and the amount in the total cell extract is reduced 5-10-fold. A modified beta-galactosidase, having as its NH2-terminal the NH2-terminal 13 residues of the L-A-encoded major coat protein, is blocked in a wild-type host, but not in a mak3-1 host. We propose that MAK3 encodes an N-acetyltransferase whose modification of the L-A major coat protein NH2 terminus is essential for viral assembly, and that unassembled coat protein is unstable."
https://openalex.org/W1501616836,"Arginine 244 is a highly conserved residue in Class A beta-lactamases, while methionine 69 is not. Informational suppression experiments show that replacement of M69 by a leucine, or that of R244 by most other amino acids lead to clavulanic acid-resistant phenotypes. The arginyl 244 side chain is tightly held in a network of interactions within the active site. Its replacement by a glutamine or a threonine perturbs the enzyme kinetics but to a smaller extent than would have been predicted if it were directly involved in substrate binding. Clavulanic acid and sulbactam still interact specifically with the mutant enzymes but are much less efficiently metabolized. Substitutions at position 244 also unveil interactions between the C6 substituent of substrates and the Asn132/Glu104 region of the active site. Methionine 69 is located in a region of strong structural constraints and presents an unusual conformation. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that its replacement by a leucine does not release the strain in this area and induces only minor structural changes. Accordingly, the kinetic behavior of the mutant is only marginally perturbed, except for suicide inhibitors. Both clavulanic acid and sulbactam are well degraded by the mutant enzyme, while irreversible inactivation is dramatically decreased. The contribution of both residues to catalysis is discussed in the light of the kinetic and structural data."
https://openalex.org/W1509102593,"Movement of cellular organelles in a directional manner along polar microtubules is driven by the motor proteins, kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein. The binding of these proteins to a microsomal fraction from embryonic chicken brain is investigated here. Both motors exhibit saturation binding to the vesicles, and proteolysis of vesicle membrane proteins abolishes binding. The maximal binding for kinesin is 12 +/- 1.7 and 43 +/- 2 pmol per mg of vesicle protein with or without 1 mM ATP, respectively. The maximal binding for cytoplasmic dynein is 55 +/- 3.8 and 73 +/- 3.7 pmol per mg of vesicle protein with or without ATP, respectively. These values correspond to 1-6 sites per vesicle of 100-nm diameter. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), inhibited kinesin binding to vesicles but increased kinesin binding to microtubules. An antibody to the kinesin light chain also inhibited vesicle binding to kinesin. In the absence but not presence of ATP, competition between the two motors for binding was observed. We suggest that there are two distinguishable binding sites for kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein on these organelles in the presence of ATP and a shared site in the absence of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1582796713,"The recA730 mutation results in constitutive SOS and prophage induction. We examined biochemical properties of recA730 protein in an effort to explain the constitutive activity observed in recA730 strains. We find that recA730 protein is more proficient than the wild-type recA protein in the competition with single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB protein) for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding sites. Because an increased aptitude in the competition with SSB protein has been previously reported for recA441 protein and recA803 protein, we directly compared their in vitro activities with those of recA730 protein. At low magnesium ion concentration, both ATP hydrolysis and lexA protein cleavage experiments demonstrate that these recA proteins displace SSB protein from ssDNA in a manner consistent with their in vivo repressor cleavage activity, i.e. recA730 protein > recA441 protein > recA803 protein > recAwt protein. Additionally, a correlation exists between the proficiency of the recA proteins in SSB protein displacement and their rate of association with ssDNA. We propose that an increased rate of association with ssDNA allows recA730 protein to displace SSB protein from the ssDNA that occurs naturally in Escherichia coli and thereby to become activated for the repressor cleavage that leads to SOS induction. RecA441 protein is similarly activated for repressor cleavage; however, in this case, significant SSB protein displacement occurs only at elevated temperature. At physiological magnesium ion concentration, we argue that recA803 protein and wild-type recA protein do not displace sufficient SSB protein from ssDNA to constitutively induce the SOS response."
https://openalex.org/W1661643493,"Actin monomers with bound ATP, ADP, or fluorescent analogues of these nucleotides exchange the nucleotide on a second time scale, whereas filaments assembled from each of these species exchange their nucleotide with the solution at least 1,000 times slower than monomers. Filaments assembled from either ATP-actin or ADP-actin are indistinguishable by electron microscopy after negative staining. The dynamic elasticity and viscosity of filaments assembled from ATP-actin or ADP-actin or mixtures of these two species are the same over a wide range of frequencies. These observations do not support a recent suggestion (Janmey, P. A., Hvidt, S., Oster, G. F., Lamb, J., Stossel, T. P., and Hartwig, J. H. (1990) Nature 347, 95-99) that ATP hydrolysis within actin filaments stiffens the polymer and alters both their structure and affinity for nucleotides. The difference in observations between these two studies may be related to time-dependent changes in ADP-actin prepared in slightly different ways."
https://openalex.org/W2160996840,"Although it is energetically extremely unfavorable to have charged amino acid residues of a polypeptide in the hydrophobic environment of the membrane phospholipid bilayer, a few such charged residues are found in membrane-spanning regions of membrane proteins. Ion pairs (salt bridges) would be much more stable in low dielectric media than single ionized residues. This paper provides indirect evidence for a salt bridge between Asp-240 and Lys-319 in the lactose carrier of Escherichia coli. When Asp-240 was changed to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis, there was a loss of the ability to accumulate methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (TMG), melibiose, or lactose. Fast-growing revertants were isolated on melibiose minimal agar plates. Two second-site revertants were isolated: Asp-240-->Ala plus Gly-268-->Val and Asp-240-->Ala plus Lys-319-->Gln. These revertants showed extremely poor accumulation of TMG, melibiose, and lactose, but showed significant downhill lactose entry into beta-galactosidase-containing cells with sugar concentrations of 2 and 5 mM. It is concluded that there is some important interaction between Asp-240 and Lys-319, possibly a salt bridge."
https://openalex.org/W1502209609,"The characterization of mineral-associated polyanions from the unicellular alga Pleurochrysis carterae is described. This species is useful for the study of mineralization, because it produces calcified scales known as coccoliths in homogeneous cell culture. Three acidic polysaccharides (PS-1, PS-2, and PS-3) were extracted from the coccoliths with EDTA and were separated and purified by differential precipitation with magnesium ions and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. PS-1 and PS-3 are predominantly polymers of galacturonic acid containing lesser amounts of other monosaccharides. PS-2 has an unusual structure. Chemical, enzymatic, and two-dimensional NMR analyses demonstrate that the repeating unit of PS-2 is [----4)D-glucuronate(beta 1----2)meso-tartrate(3----1)glyoxylate(1-]n. Thus PS-2 has a high density of negatively charged groups available for calcium ion binding, similar to the phosphoprotein polyanions of other species. Polysaccharides containing tartrate and/or glyoxylate have not been previously described; these residues may be introduced into PS-2 by a postpolymerization process involving oxidative cleavage of glucuronate or mannuronate residues."
https://openalex.org/W1501889443,"We have used chimeras and point mutations of recombinant coagulation factor IX to examine factor IX's specific interaction with bovine endothelial cells. Previously (Toomey, J. R., Smith, K. J., Roberts, H. R., and Stafford, D. W. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 1806-1808), we restricted the region of factor IX responsible for binding to endothelial cells to its Gla domain. Molecular modeling of the Gla domain of factor IX using the coordinates of the Gla domain of bovine prothrombin-(1-145) (Soriano-Garcia, M., Padmanabhan, K., deVos, A. M., and Tulinsky, A. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 2554-2566) reveals two major surface determinants whose sequences differ among factors IX, X, and VII. A chimeric protein comprised of the Gla domain of factor VII with the remainder of the molecule of factor IX did not bind to the endothelial cell binding site. We changed residues 33, 34, 35, 39, and 40 to those of factor IX without restoring endothelial cell binding. Replacement of amino acid residues 3-10 with those of factor IX restored normal binding. With the knowledge that specific binding was localized to the first 11 amino acids, point mutations were made at residues predicted to be on the surface in this region of the factor IX molecule. Changing lysine 5 to alanine (K5A) or valine 10 to lysine (V10K) resulted in loss of binding with total retention of in vitro clotting activity. The lysine 5 to arginine (K5R) mutation also was fully active in vitro but displayed 3-fold tighter binding. In addition to defining the sequence of factor IX necessary for binding to endothelial cells, these results suggest that the binding site is not phospholipid but instead is specific, and in all likelihood, protein."

Digestion of these proteoglycans with chondroitinase ABC generated a single 40-kDa core protein while digestion with keratanase generated a single 52-kDa core protein. Digestion with both enzymes combined, however, increased the amount of 40-kDa core protein produced. This suggested that the 40-kDa core protein exists with chondroitin/dermatan sulfate (C/DS) side chains alone and with both C/DS and keratan sulfate (KS) side chains. The proteoglycan fraction was initially digested with chondroitinase ABC, and the M(r) = 40,000 core protein derived from proteoglycans containing C/DS side chains alone was isolated. Amino-terminal sequencing showed it to be the chick cognate of decorin. The remaining proteoglycans were then digested with keratanase, and both the 40-kDa core protein and the 52-kDa core proteins derived from KS-containing proteoglycans were purified. The M(r) = 40,000 core protein derived from proteoglycans containing both C/DS and KS side chains had the same amino-terminal sequence as decorin and cross-reacted with antibodies to decorin. Sequence from the 52-kDa core protein derived from KS-containing proteoglycans showed it to be lumican. The results of this study suggest that adult chick corneas contain two isoforms of decorin: one containing C/DS side chains and the other, a hybrid, containing both C/DS and KS side chains. Embryonic corneas did not contain the hybrid isoform of decorin. These results suggest that different post-translational modifications occur to the decorin gene product during corneal development and maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1560053074,"The promoter of the pig lactase-phlorizin hydrolase was cloned and showed to be functional in the human intestinal cell line Caco2. The proximal promoter was analyzed for binding of nuclear proteins from small intestine and liver. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays show, that an intestinal nuclear factor (NF-LPH1) binds to a sequence (-40 to -54) located close to the TATA-box. Enterocytes from newborn pigs with high lactase activity contain high amounts of NF-LPH1, whereas enterocytes from adult pigs with low lactase activity contain low amounts of NF-LPH1. The liver does not contain lactase activity, and NF-LPH1 is not present in liver nuclear extracts in detectable amounts. This indicates that NF-LPH1 is involved in the decline of lactase at weaning and may be of importance for the molecular explanation of hypolactasia in humans. It was demonstrated by transfection of two different promoter-reporter gene constructs into Caco2 cells, that there are additional cis-element(s) in the region -142 to approximately -980, which are important for the transcription of the lactase-phlorizin hydrolase gene."
https://openalex.org/W1519604321,"Gliostatin is a polypeptide growth inhibitor of apparent M(r) = 100,000 with a homodimeric structure comprising two 50-kDa subunits, acting on astrocyte as well as astrocytoma cells (Asai, K., Hirano, T., Kaneko, S., Moriyama, A., Nakanishi, K., Isobe, I., Eksioglu, Y.Z., and Kato, T. (1992) J. Neurochem., 59, 307-317). The amino acid sequences of 13 tryptic peptides including the amino terminus were completely identical to those of platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) (Ishikawa, F., Miyazono, K., Hellman, U., Drexler, H., Wernstedt, C., Hagiwara, K., Usuki, K., Takaku, F., Risau, W., and Heldin, C.-H. (1989) Nature 338, 557-562). Gliostatin and PD-ECGF, purified from human placenta, shared growth inhibition on glial cells and growth promotion on endothelial cells, and exhibited similar values for half-maximal dose of glial growth inhibition (ID50 = 1.3 nM) and the half-maximal concentration of endothelial growth promotion (EC50 = 1.0 nM), suggesting that both factors evoke the biological actions through an identical receptor on each cell surface. We have further demonstrated evidence of a novel neurotrophic action of gliostatin/PD-ECGF toward embryonic rat cortical neurons in culture. The half-maximal concentration of gliostatin/PD-ECGF for neurotrophic action was 0.3 nM. All actions on glial, endothelial, and neuronal cells, were abolished by a monoclonal antibody against gliostatin. These data indicate that gliostatin/PD-ECGF may play important roles on development and regeneration of the central nervous system and may also involve the induction of angiogenesis for the formation of blood brain barrier."
https://openalex.org/W1529469781,"M-Protein (165 kDa) is a structural constituent of myofibrillar M-band in striated muscle. We generated a monoclonal antibody which recognized a 165-kDa protein from chicken pectoralis muscle in immunoblot analysis and stained the M-band under immunofluorescence microscopy. By screening a lambda gt11 cDNA library from chicken embryonic pectoralis muscle with this antibody, we isolated a cDNA clone encoding the M-protein. Northern blot analysis showed that M-protein mRNA is expressed in pectoralis and cardiac muscle but not in gizzard smooth muscle or non-muscle tissues. Moreover, the anterior latissimus dorsi muscle, which consists almost exclusively of slow fiber types, contains no detectable levels of the mRNA. The full-length cDNA sequence predicted a 1,450-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 163 x 10(3). The encoded protein contains several copies of two different repetitive motifs: five copies of fibronectin type III repeats are in the middle part of the predicted molecule, and two and four copies of the immunoglobulin C2-type repeats are located toward the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal regions, respectively. This indicates that M-protein, along with other thick filament-associated proteins such as C-protein, twichin, and titin, belongs to the superfamily of cytoskeletal proteins with immunoglobulin/fibronectin repeats."
https://openalex.org/W1514616303,"Activation of quiescent T cells leads to a dramatic increase in the rate of protein synthesis. It is believed that this pronounced increase of protein synthesis is regulated primarily at the level of translational initiation. Although considerable evidence demonstrates that translational initiation can be regulated at the post-translational level by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of translation initiation factors (eIFs) such as eIF-4E and eIF-2 alpha, additional mechanisms of eIF gene expression may also play a role in the regulation of translation in quiescent cells and/or during their subsequent induction to enter the cell cycle. To address this issue, gene expression of eIF-2 alpha, -4E, and -4A was studied in quiescent human peripheral blood T cells following stimulation through the T cell receptor-CD3 complex. Quiescent T cells expressed low levels of eIF-2 alpha, -4E, and -4A mRNAs and proteins as compared to proliferating T cells. Activation of resting T cells resulted in a rapid increase (20-50-fold) in the levels of these three mRNAs. This increase did not require new protein synthesis. Furthermore, transcription rates of these three eIF genes showed only minor increase over the induction period as measured by nuclear run-on assays. Despite the rapid increase in initiation factor mRNA levels, increases in eIF protein levels lagged significantly behind. Western blot analysis also showed that the protein levels of the three eIFs were differentially increased. eIF-4A protein levels increased in proportion to the observed increase in cellular protein synthetic activity while the increases in eIF-4E and eIF-2 alpha proteins were proportionately less. The low levels of eIF proteins in quiescent T cells appear to correlate with low protein synthesis rate in such cells. The induction of eIF proteins by post-transcriptional/translational mechanisms appears to contribute to the pronounced stimulation of protein synthesis that occurs during T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1535613423,"Abstract Nucleotide substitutions in the gene for NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase were identified in three independent probands of hereditary methemoglobinemia type I. Patients in Kagoshima and Okinawa in Japan were shown to possess the same base change, from guanine to adenine at codon 57, which results in amino acid substitution from Arg to Gln. This nucleotide change was the same as formerly found in a patient in Toyoake, Japan (Katsube, T., Sakamoto, N., Kobayashi, Y., Seki, R., Hirano, M., Tanishima, K., Tomoda, A., Takazakura, E., Yubisui, T., Takeshita, M., Sakaki, Y., and Fukumaki, Y. (1991) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 48, 799-808). A type I patient in Italy was shown to have a base change from guanine to adenine at codon 105 which causes substitution from Val to Met. To characterize the enzymes of type I patients, Arg-57----Gln and Val-105----Met mutant enzymes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. kcat/Km values (NADH) of these two enzymes were 25% in Arg-57----Gln and 14.5% in Val-105----Met compared with that of the wild type enzyme, while the value of type II (generalized, severe form of the disease) mutant enzyme was 3% of the normal value (Yubisui, T., Shirabe, K., Takeshita, M., Kobayashi, Y., Fukumaki, Y., Sakaki, Y., and Takano, T. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 66-70). The type I mutant enzymes were less heat-stable and more susceptible to proteinase treatment than the wild type. From these results we conclude that restriction of enzyme deficiency to red cells in hereditary methemoglobinemia type I may be generally derived from instability and increased proteolytic susceptibility of variant NADH-cytochrome b5 reductases due to a point mutation."

L-Histidine was found to be a relatively good ligand (KD, 500 nM). Methods have been developed for the separation of liganded from unliganded LAO, for the estimation of bound ligand, and for unliganding LAO. Liganded and unliganded LAO are shown to have distinct UV spectra. The UV spectrum also varies with the nature of the substrate.

https://openalex.org/W1510100072,"Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) has been shown to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in macrophages. However, the site of its effect on the HIV infectious cycle is unknown. We show here that IFN-gamma inhibits the transactivation of HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) during viral infection and that it antagonizes tat effect in HT4LacZ-1 cells. HT4LacZ-1 is an indicator CD4+ HeLa cell line for HIV infectivity, because it harbors a HIV LTR-LacZ gene susceptible to transactivation by tat. It was used in combination with a computer-assisted image analyzer to quantify: (i) the number of transactivated foci following HIV infection, (ii) their individual level of transactivation, and (iii) the fusion potency of infected cells. IFN-gamma induced a 75% decrease of the number of transactivated foci following infection of HT4LacZ-1 cells by HIV. The remaining 25% foci still susceptible to transactivation were transactivated at a lower level than in control cultures, and the fusion potency of infected cells was strongly decreased. IFN-gamma acted after HIV entry into the cell and independently of reverse transcription. IFN-gamma antagonized tat-induced LTR transactivation: it inhibited transactivation of HT4LacZ-1 cells when tat was provided either from a SV40-based expression vector of tat or by polyethylene glycol-induced cell fusion with HeLa-tat-III cells. These results suggest that IFN-gamma affects the expression or the activity of cellular factors interacting with tat and that the high level of IFN-gamma production associated with HIV infection plays a role in the establishment of HIV latency."

The final crystallographic R-factor, based on all data in the range 6.0-2.35 A (7470 reflections), is 0.232. Bond lengths and bond angles in the molecule have root mean square deviations from ideal values of 0.016 A and 2.4 degrees, respectively. The overall structure is highly compact and globular with a predominantly hydrophobic core. The main structural feature of rhuIL-4 is a four alpha-helix bundle, which composes approximately 58% of the structure. The helices are arranged in a left-handed antiparallel bundle with two overhand connections. Within these connections is a two-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. Both the tertiary and secondary structures of rhuIL-4 are similar to those of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Critical regions for receptor binding are proposed."

Chromatography of HD1 after treatment with alkaline phosphatase yields two distinct histone deacetylase forms (HD1-A, HD1-B). The same is true for chromatography after phosphatase treatment of a total cell extract. One of these enzyme forms (HD1-A) is subject to phosphorylation, which causes a change in the substrate specificity of the enzyme, as shown with HPLC-purified individual core histone species; the substrate specificity for H2A increases more than 2-fold after phosphorylation, whereas the specificity for H3 decreases to about 60%. The total histone deacetylase activity is quantitatively released from isolated nuclei after extraction with moderate ionic strength buffers; no significant residual enzyme activity could be detected in the nuclear matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1520511120,"Expression of the alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha IIb beta 3 integrin genes is differentially regulated during megakaryocytic differentiation of pluripotent K562 cells induced with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Upon megakaryocytic differentiation, steady-state alpha 2 mRNA increased markedly from the undetectable level present in the uninduced cells. The level of beta 1 mRNA did not change. Expression of alpha IIb beta 3 is regulated differently. beta 3 mRNA was undetectable in uninduced cells but increased significantly following induction. alpha IIb mRNA was detectable at a low level prior to induction, but at an increased level following differentiation. Altered mRNA stability did not contribute to changes in mRNA levels. Nuclear run-off experiments revealed a 20-fold increase in alpha 2 gene transcription upon megakaryocytic differentiation, but no change in transcription of the beta 1 gene. Transcription of both the alpha IIb and beta 3 genes increased 10- and 5-fold, respectively. Thus, the increase in alpha 2 beta 1 protein which accompanies the megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells is a consequence of the increased steady-state level of alpha 2 mRNA due to transcriptional activation of the alpha 2 gene. The long-lived beta 1 mRNA is not altered during differentiation. In contrast, increased alpha IIb beta 3 protein appears due to increased steady-state levels of both alpha IIb and beta 3 mRNAs that result from transcriptional activation of both integrin genes."
https://openalex.org/W1603722542,"To elucidate the effects of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) released from vascular endothelial cells (ECs) on handling of intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+i) in ECs themselves and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), we measured the Ca2+i by two-dimensional digital image analysis of fura-2-loaded ECs and VSMCs in tissue culture. In isoculture of one cell type, adenosine triphosphate (ATP, 1 microM) transiently increased the Ca2+i of both ECs and VSMCs. High-K+ depolarization or angiotensin II also elevated the Ca2+i of VSMCs, whereas neither stimulants changed the Ca2+i of ECs. In coculture of ECs with VSMCs, the same dose of ATP rapidly increased the Ca2+i of ECs and then transiently decreased the Ca2+i of VSMCs to below the resting level. The maximal Ca2+i-modulating effects of ATP on both cell types were reproducible after the second application of ATP. Three kinds of EDRF blockers (L-NG-monomethylarginine, methemoglobin, or methylene blue) potentiated the ATP-induced Ca2+i rise in ECs and attenuated the Ca2+i reduction in VSMCs, suggesting the autocrine and paracrine effects of EDRF on ECs and VSMCs, respectively. However, neither indomethacin, superoxide dismutase, nor neutralizing monoclonal antibody to endothelin-1 altered the second responses. Thus, two-dimensional Ca2+i image analysis of ECs and VSMCs in coculture enabled direct visualization of the EDRF actions in ECs and VSMCs and their modifications."

The stimulatory agonist prostaglandin E1 increased the potency and the maximum extent of stimulation due to TD beta gamma GTP gamma S). With a similar concentration dependence, TD beta gamma GTP gamma S exerted an inhibitory influence on forskolin-stimulated adenylylcyclase activity. At the same concentrations, beta gamma-dimers isolated with either GTP or Gpp(NH)p did not alter enzyme activities. The observed effects of TD beta gamma GTP gamma S were similar to those of directly added GTP gamma S with regard to maximum levels, time dependence, and persistence; however, TD beta gamma GTP gamma S was approximately 10-fold more potent than GTP gamma S. Treatment of TD beta gamma GTP gamma S, but not of free GTP gamma S, with hydroxylamine caused a loss of adenylylcyclase regulation by TD beta gamma GTP gamma S. The data presented indicated that TD beta gamma GTP gamma S potently and efficiently activates the stimulatory and inhibitory G proteins of adenylylcyclase in human platelet membranes. Furthermore, evidence is provided suggesting that the observed effects of TD beta gamma GTP gamma S, which can be thiophosphorylated by GTP gamma S at the beta-subunit (Wieland, T., Ulibarri, I., Gierschik, P., and Jakobs, K. H. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 196, 707-716), are due to formation of GTP gamma S at the G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1551681863,"The regulation of collagenase gene expression by serotonin and progesterone was investigated in primary cultures of rat uterine smooth muscle cells. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)), when administered to cells in serotonin-depleted medium, causes 6-8-fold increases in levels of collagenase mRNA. Selective serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonists were able to mimic the effect of the natural hormone, while the induction by serotonin could be blocked by 5-HT2 receptor antagonists. Addition of phorbol ester (PMA) to 5-HT-depleted cultures fully mimicked the effect of 5-HT on collagenase mRNA induction. Treatment with progesterone analogs caused a decrease in collagenase mRNA, even in the presence of saturating levels of serotonin or PMA. In all experiments, levels of secreted collagenase were observed to correspond to levels of collagenase mRNA. Experiments with cycloheximide demonstrate that serotonin- and PMA-induced increases in collagenase mRNA are dependent on protein synthesis. Furthermore, nuclear run-on analysis shows that mRNA increases are accompanied by increases in initiation of transcripts. These data indicate that transcription of collagenase mRNA in myometrial smooth muscle cells is stimulated by serotonin, possibly via activation of protein kinase C, but is in some way prevented by the negative influence of progesterone."
https://openalex.org/W1578081864,"In 38C B lymphocytes, membrane IgM is expressed on the surface, whereas secretory IgM (sIgM) is rapidly degraded. Here, we localize this degradation and characterize the proteases involved in this process. Upon treatment with brefeldin A, degradation of sIgM in 38C cells was strongly inhibited, as was secretion from the sIgM-secreting D2 hybridoma. Moreover, the brefeldin A-induced Golgi resorption resulted in galactosylation of sIgM and partial resistance to endoglycosidase H. However, sIgM avoided degradation neither due to modified terminal glycosylation nor as a consequence of the brefeldin A-induced altered milieu of the endoplasmic reticulum. When these modifications were prevented by inhibiting retrograde transport with nocodazole or by abrogating terminal glycosylation with swainsonine, sIgM was still rescued from degradation. The unaffected breakdown in the presence of nocodazole also argued against recycling of sIgM to be degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, upon removal of brefeldin A, degradation of galactosylated sIgM resumed in 38C cells, as did secretion from D2 cells. These results indicate that functional export of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum is a prerequisite for sIgM degradation. Biochemical characterization of this novel postendoplasmic reticulum/pre-trans-Golgi proteolytic pathway included application of inhibitors to a broad spectrum of proteases. Among the compounds tested, only calpain inhibitor I exerted strong inhibition. The involvement of cysteine protease(s) in the degradation of sIgM was corroborated by the inhibitory effect of diamide. We conclude that B lymphocytes avoid secretion by active and selective targeting of sIgM to a developmentally regulated postendoplasmic reticulum degradation pathway in which degradation is mediated by a cysteine protease."
https://openalex.org/W1564164342,"The glucose transport system in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells has been examined by measuring the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. Angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in cells made quiescent by removing serum from the culture medium in a dose- and time-dependent manner that was shown to be receptor-mediated. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), fetal calf serum, thrombin, and arginine vasopressin also stimulated glucose transport. Cycloheximide did not affect the immediate-early (30 min) activation by either Ang II or EGF, but abolished any further increase. This suggested that, whereas the initial activation of glucose transport was independent of protein synthesis, the sustained increase required the synthesis of new glucose transporters. This was supported by 4-fold and 2-fold accumulations of GLUT-1 mRNA 4 h after exposure to Ang II and EGF, respectively. The induction of GLUT-1 mRNA was preceded by rapid and transient expression of c-fos and c-jun protooncogenes. In nuclear run-on assays, nuclei from Ang II-treated cells showed increased synthesis of GLUT-1 mRNA at 30 min and 1 h after hormone treatment. In contrast, in cells exposed to actinomycin D, pretreatment with Ang II had no effect on the turnover rates of GLUT-1 mRNa. These results are consistent with Ang II acting to stimulate the rate of transcription of the GLUT-1 gene leading to increased production of GLUT-1 protein and glucose transport."
https://openalex.org/W1574761466,"In yeast nuclear extracts, tagetitoxin inhibition of RNA polymerase III promoter-directed single- and multiple-round transcription is characterized by pausing or stalling of the elongation complex at several discrete points on the template. Paused ternary complexes isolated from tagetitoxin-inhibited reactions can be elongated to produce full-length RNA. The distribution of pause sites is distinct for each of the class III genes we have examined. These tagetitoxin-enhanced pause sites may also be intrinsic pause sites for the elongation complex. Tagetitoxin inhibition of in vitro transcription of the yeast SUP4 and SUP6 tRNA(Tyr) genes demonstrates template dependence and indicates that inhibition may occur after UMP incorporation. Factor-independent transcription by purified yeast RNA polymerase III can also be inhibited by tagetitoxin, and the degree of inhibition is template-dependent. Tagetitoxin may be most effective as an inhibitor under conditions where polymerase III tends to pause on the template. We propose that differences in tagetitoxin inhibition among class III genes may reflect differences in the number of stability of these pause sites."
https://openalex.org/W1516294781,"Functional relationships between epidermal growth factor (EGF) and neural tissues have of late attracted increasing interest. However, in spite of reported EGF effects on neurons, the expression of the EGF receptor (EGF-R) has not yet been unambiguously demonstrated in these cells. This 170-kDa protein bears an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain in which activity is ligand-dependent. We give definitive evidence here for its presence in neonatal and adult rat neurons showing also, for the first time, its binding and functional tyrosine kinase activities in the synaptic region. Immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal antibody prepared against the receptor purified from rat liver showed positive staining localized exclusively to neurons without regionalization to any particular brain zone. Binding studies made in Percoll-obtained synaptosomes revealed specific high affinity 125I-EGF binding sites (Kd, 1.42 x 10(-10) +/- 0.58 M) accounting for 17% of total binding and a great majority of low affinity (Kd, 2.55 x 10(-9) +/- 0.35 M) binding sites. Higher binding capacity was found in synaptosomal fractions obtained from newborn rats. The identity of the synaptosomal EGF binding activity with the 170-kDA EGF-R protein was demonstrated by cross-linking experiments. Furthermore, EGF-Affi-Prep affinity chromatography adsorbs a 170-kDa protein with EGF-R immunoreactivity from whole homogenates of adult rat brain. Phosphorylation assays made in freeze-thawed or intact synaptosomes showed EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in the range of 170-, 126-150-, 124-, 113-, 98-, and 70-kDa proteins including the EGF-R. Thus, the EGF-R/EGF regulatory system could have a role in synaptic function that remains to be explored."
https://openalex.org/W1545809039,"Abstract Actins from most eukaryotes undergo a unique post-translational modification of the amino terminus called processing. Processing consists of the removal of an amino-terminal Ac-Met or Ac-Cys to leave an acidic amino-terminal residue.

Here we present the isolation and characterization of the actin N-acetylaminopeptidase (ANAP) from rat liver. A five-step purification protocol achieves a 4100-fold purification of the enzyme with an overall 8% recovery of activity. ANAP is a 77-kDa monomer with a pI of 4.6. Using unprocessed yeast actin as a substrate, the Km of ANAP is 3.5 microM. Purified ANAP was used to generate a polyclonal antibody. The antibody has been used along with activity assays to demonstrate the presence of ANAP in a variety of rat tissues. Finally, evidence is presented that in mammals, ANAP may function with a second, as yet unpurified, component to process actin amino termini."
https://openalex.org/W1604336621,"The effects of unfolding, refolding, and hybridization of triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) subunits from different species and subunits which have been specifically modified at the active site have been examined. These effects have been evaluated in terms of changes in catalytic parameters, CD spectra, and susceptibility to denaturation. Dissociation followed by reassociation yields an active dimer but with increased Km, reduced kcat, and increased susceptibility to inactivation and unfolding in denaturants. These data suggest that while the general structure of the refolded dimer is similar to the native enzyme, its complete original structure is not restored. Covalent reaction of the active site Glu165 with the substrate analogue 3-chloroacetol phosphate (CAP) results in dimers with increased susceptibility to unfolding and inactivation by denaturants (i.e. the rates of inactivation and unfolding are (TPICAP)2 greater than (TPI-TPICAP) greater than (TPI)2). These data point to the interactions between the catalytic center and the subunit interface. Subunits of TPI from different species, in spite of structural differences at the subunit interface, hybridized to active heterodimers. Subunit hybridization was random among monomers from different mammals, preferential between yeast and mammalian or avian monomers. Hybridization did not occur between avian and mammalian monomers under these conditions. These data provide information on the elements in the interface of the dimer and the relationship of the catalytic center with the subunit interface."

[3H]APNIC bound to the mastocytoma membrane with high affinity and in a saturable manner. Scatchard plot analysis indicated a single binding site with a Kd of 4.7 nM and a Bmax of 0.58 pmol/mg protein. The binding of [3H]APNIC was dose dependently inhibited by APNIC and iloprost, another stable PGI2 agonist, and to a much lesser extent by PGE2. The binding of the radioligand showed sensitivity to the guanine nucleotide guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio-triphosphate) (GTP gamma S). Photolysis of [3H]APNIC-prelabeled membranes resulted in incorporation of radiolabel into a protein of approximately 43 kDa. Photolabeling was inhibited by PGI2 agonists and other prostaglandins with specificity for the PGI2 receptor and was modulated by GTP gamma S. A protein of approximately 45 kDa was also labeled by [3H]APNIC in the membrane of porcine platelets, membranes that are known to be abundant in PGI2 receptors. These results demonstrate that [3H]APNIC specifically labels a protein that may represent the PGI2 receptor and that this radioprobe will be a useful reagent for further characterization and purification of the PGI2 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W65758851,"The events that follow the import of pLHCPIIb, the apoprotein precursor of the major light-harvesting complex of photosystem II, were studied in intact pea chloroplasts. The distribution of the events of insertion into the membrane, and processing, to yield the mature form (LHCP) between stromal and granal lamellae regions of the thylakoids were followed. pLHCP was preferentially inserted into stromal lamellae (SL) from which it migrated to granal lamellae (GL). Migration occurred before or after processing, suggesting that migration and processing are independent of each other. When migration was slowed down, LHCP accumulated in SL. Prolonged inhibition of migration induced degradation of LHCP that had accumulated in SL, whereas inhibition of processing did not affect the migration of pLHCP into GL. A small difference in electrophoretic mobility was noted between LHCP in SL and in GL. The predominant mature form in SL migrated more slowly than LHCP from GL. When thylakoids were subjected to trypsin, all of the LHCP embedded in SL underwent cleavage, whereas up to 60% of the radioactive LHCP in GL was resistant to the enzyme. The possible implications of the differences in size and in the sensitivity to trypsin of LHCP are discussed."

(1989) Biochemistry 28, 8312-8317), the entire C4BP gene has now been shown to be 23 kilobases (kb) long and comprised of 10 exons ranging in size from 86 to 442 base pairs (bp). Primer extension analysis revealed the major transcription start site to be 46 bp upstream of the published cDNA start site. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from several mouse tissues demonstrated that the C4BP gene is expressed in a liver-specific manner. Several regions homologous to known response elements were identified upstream of the C4BP gene including a strong hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 binding site and four putative glucocorticoid response elements. Furthermore, dexamethasone increased C4BP mRNA and protein levels in the mouse liver cell line, NMuLi. The stimulation of C4BP gene expression was rapid and independent of protein synthesis. These results suggest dexamethasone induction of the C4BP gene is a primary response and therefore a transcriptional effect. Inhibition of the dexamethasone effect on C4BP by actinomycin D supports this theory. These studies also provide evidence that, for optimal induction of the C4BP gene, the glucocorticoid receptor complex may cooperatively interact with accessory transcription factors. It is likely that stimulation of C4BP gene expression by dexamethasone may allude to a mechanism by which glucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory effects."
https://openalex.org/W2144852796,"Abstract The coupling step in the biosynthesis of ATP in biological systems is generally believed to involve an energy-requiring release of ATP bound to the beta-subunit of the ATP synthase complex. A molecular description of the ATP binding site on the beta-subunit is, therefore, critical to understanding the mechanism of coupling in the enzyme. Previously, we reported that a purified, bacterially expressed rat liver beta-subunit binds adenine nucleotides tightly and specifically (Garboczi, D. N., Hullihen, J. H., and Pedersen, P. L. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 15694-15698). In order to assess the contribution of various regions of the isolated beta-subunit to the ATP binding site we have systematically deleted four different regions: the N-terminal region, the Walker A consensus region, the Walker B consensus region (Walker, J. E., Saraste, M., Runswick, M. J., and Gay, N. (1982) EMBO J. 1, 945-951), and a region, which, like the A and B regions, bears homology to adenylate kinase. Plasmids directing the expression of double deletions of A and B regions, and B and C regions were also constructed. In addition, 2 residues outside of these regions, His-177 and Tyr-345, which have been predicted to play a central role in nucleotide binding, were mutated. Rabbit antisera to synthetic peptides of the A and C regions verified the identity of the bacterially expressed mutant proteins. Seven of the eight mutant proteins overexpressed in Escherichia coli were resistant to E. coli proteases in the preparative stages, as predicted for compact folded proteins. Furthermore, circular dichroism spectropolarimetry revealed no profound structural alterations in the purified mutant proteins. Relative to the overexpressed full-length beta-subunit, the mutant lacking the A consensus region suffered a 30-fold loss of affinity for ATP and a loss of specificity for 2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP) over 2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-monophosphate. The mutant proteins lacking either the N-terminal region or the B region exhibited nucleotide binding properties similar to the full-length beta-subunit, whereas the mutant protein lacking the C region suffered an order of magnitude reduction in affinity for ATP. The affinity of the A and B region double deletion was indistinguishable from the A region deletion in regard to TNP-ATP binding, while the double deletion mutant lacking the B and C regions was not stably expressed in the E. coli SE6004.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1491415435,"Incubation of rat or human post-heparin plasma with [3H]dolichol incorporated in liposomes consisting of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine:dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (3:1) resulted in the formation of radioactive dolichyl oleate. Non-heparinized plasma did not esterify dolichol, and, hence, the enzyme involved is probably associated with the cell surface and released into the blood by heparin. The major location of this activity was the liver, and, therefore, a partial purification of the enzyme from heparinized rat liver perfusates was performed using DEAE-Sephacel and heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The dolichol acyltransferase activity copurified with hepatic lipase activity in a lipid-protein complex of 350 kDa. Optimal acylation is achieved at pH 7.5 in the presence of 5% plasma and 20 mM Ca2+. Esterification can only be obtained when dolichol is present in a phospholipid bilayer, and the reaction is strongly stimulated by unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylserine. Radiolabeling experiments demonstrated that the primary acyl donor is phosphatidylethanolamine from which the fatty acid is transferred exclusively from position 1. Neither cholesterol nor retinol are esterified by the enzyme, and the reaction is not stimulated by acyl-CoA. Both the extracellular localization and the mechanism of transacylation clearly distinguish this new enzyme from the acyl-CoA:dolichol acyltransferase described earlier in microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W1539005959,"Glycerol-1-P and glycerol-3-P stereoisomers of dipalmitoylphosphatidylazidothymidine were synthesized and found to have equal antiretroviral activity in HIV-infected HT4-6C cells. It was anticipated that the glycerol-1-P isomer would be less active because of slow metabolic conversion by cellular phospholipases A and C, but the antiretroviral results suggested that the human cell line (HT4-6C) may have phospholipases capable of hydrolyzing 2,3-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol-1-phospho-5'-azidothymidine (AZT). To evaluate this possibility, we purified lysosomal phospholipase A1, an enzyme known to play a major role in cellular phospholipid catabolism. This enzyme rapidly hydrolyzed both the sn-1 and sn-3 isomers of dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-AZT. We synthesized sn-2,3-dipalmitoyl-glycero-1-phosphocholine and found that it is also hydrolyzed readily by lysosomal phospholipase A1 although the Vmax, 59 mumol mg-1 h-1, is slightly lower than that of the sn-1,2-dipalmitoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 89 mumol mg-1 h-1. In conclusion, our studies show that sn-2,3-dipalmitoyl-glycerol-1-phospho-AZT is equal in antiviral activity to sn-1,2-dipalmitoyl-glycero-3-phospho-AZT in HIV-infected HT4-6C cells. This surprising result is due in part to the lack of stereospecificity of lysosomal phospholipase A1."
