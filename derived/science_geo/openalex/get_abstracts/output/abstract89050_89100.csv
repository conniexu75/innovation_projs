https://openalex.org/W2013097801,"Aggregating autologous platelets caused contraction of isolated rings of canine left circumflex arteries. The contractions were augmented after removal of the endothelium and were attenuated by serotonergic antagonists. During contraction caused by prostaglandin F2 alpha, aggregating platelets caused a transient increase in tension followed by a profound relaxation of arteries with endothelium, but caused only further contraction of arteries without endothelium. These observations demonstrate the importance of the vascular endothelium in opposing the constriction of coronary vessels caused by 5-hydroxytryptamine and other substances released from aggregating platelets."
https://openalex.org/W2072878692,"The effect of a partial pressure of nitrogen of 50 atmospheres (5065 kilopascals ) on the hydrogen evolution reaction of nitrogenase has been investigated. Evolution of hydrogen was not blocked completely by 50 atmospheres of nitrogen in any of four experiments; rather, 27.3 +/- 2.4 percent of the total electron flux through nitrogenase was directed toward production of hydrogen. The ratio of hydrogen evolved to nitrogen fixed was close to 1:1, which implies that hydrogen evolution is obligatory in the fixation of molecular nitrogen by nitrogenase."

Results suggest that albumin can influence, qualitatively and quantitatively, the metabolism of eicosanoids."
https://openalex.org/W2055033768,"A rapid gene-mapping system uses a high-resolution, dual-laser sorter to identify genes from separate human chromosomes prepared with a new stain combination. This system was used to sort 21 unique chromosome types onto nitrocellulose filter papers. Several labeled gene probes hybridized to the sorted chromosomal DNA types predicted by their previous chromosome assignments. The skeletal muscle glycogen phosphorylase gene was then mapped to a portion of chromosome 11 by spot blotting normal and translocated chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1690946024,"The O-sulfation of specific proteins on tyrosine residues was studied using the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 as a model system. In intact PC12 cells labeled with inorganic [35S]sulfate, the major protein substrates for sulfation on tyrosine were four acidic polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 113,000, 105,000, 86,000, and 84,000 designated as p113, p105, p86, and p84. After labeling of intact PC12 cells with inorganic [32P]phosphate, these four proteins were also found to be phosphorylated at serine residues. Peptide mapping after limited proteolysis indicated sequence homologies between p113 and p105, and between p86 and p84. In lysed PC12 cells, p113, p105, p86, and p84 were phosphorylated at serine residues by an endogenous protein kinase using [32P] ATP. Moreover, in the cell-free preparation, an enzymatic activity was detected that was able to catalyze the sulfation of the four proteins on tyrosine residues. This sulfation reaction, which used adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phospho[35S]sulfate as the sulfate donor, occurred in a particulate fraction of PC12 cells and was inhibited by 5 mM EDTA. These results demonstrate the presence in PC12 cells of a novel enzyme, designated here as a tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase, and imply a role for this enzyme in the post-translational processing of specific PC12 cell proteins."

Trypsin digestion of the ADP-ribosylated transducin and further purification using boronate-polyacrylamide beads and high performance liquid chromatography yielded a single radiolabeled tetrapeptide, Ser-Arg-Val-Lys. The ADP-ribose is linked to the guanidinium group of arginine."
https://openalex.org/W2011346454,"Expression of the cellular abl (c- abl ) oncogene was studied in K-562 and other chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells and cell lines by means of Northern blot hybridization. In contrast to non-CML cells, which contained 7.4- and 6.8-kilobase abl -related transcripts, the CML cells contained a predominant and novel 8.2-kilobase abl -related RNA. In addition, the levels of abl -related message were up to eight times higher in CML cell lines from patients at the blast crisis stage of the disease compared with CML cells obtained during the chronic phase and with non-CML cells."
https://openalex.org/W2014165281,"Amplification is one of the mechanisms by which cellular oncogenes may be altered in their function, possibly leading to neoplastic transformation. The oncogenes c-myc, c- abl , and c-Ki-ras are amplified in several different human neoplasias. The oncogene c-myb, which is specifically expressed and regulated in hematopoietic cells, was found to be amplified in cell lines ML-1, ML-2, and ML-3, which were separately cultured from cells of a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). A five- to tenfold amplification was correlated with high levels of expression of normal size c-myb messenger RNA and with chromosomal abnormalities in the region 6q22 -24, where the c-myb locus is normally located. Amplification and cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in DNA's from primary and secondary cultures of ML cells, suggesting that they may have contributed to leukemogenesis. The similar AML cell lines HL-60 and ML's contain different amplified oncogenes: c-myc and c-myb, respectively. Alternative activation of structurally and possibly functionally similar oncogenes may distinguish--at the pathogenetic level--phenotypically similar tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2016697658,"The mutagenic potential of recombinant DNA in the germ line was investigated in the descendants of mice obtained from eggs injected with the human growth-hormone gene in a pBR322 vector. Six positive animals (including one mosaic) were produced and had 1-20 copies of the donor sequences in unique and often complex integration patterns indicative of a single or an interrupted insertion. All were heterozygotes and transmitted the foreign insert to their progeny, forming six new HUGH strains. Matings between heterozygotes yielded viable healthy homozygotes in four of the strains. However, in the HUGH/3 and HUGH/4 strains, no postnatal homozygotes were found and litter sizes at birth were small. These two independent cases of mutation, both homozygous recessive prenatal lethals, are attributable to disruption of native sequences by alien ones. They constitute the first instances of insertional mutagenesis due to integration of recombinant DNA in the germ line of the mouse. The mutants provide new possibilities for molecular identification of gene functions necessary for normal development."

https://openalex.org/W1995608753,"The effect of hemin on the rate of synthesis and the level of globin messenger RNA's in the human erythroid cell line K562 was examined by means of cloned hybridization probes specific for each of the human embryonic, fetal, and adult globin genes. Hemin increases both the rate of transcription and the level of accumulation of zeta-, epsilon-, gamma-, and alpha-globin messenger RNA's by a factor of 3 to 5. Thus, hemin induction of globin gene expression in K562 cells is at the level of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1581718250,"Treatment of the leukemic promyelocytic cell line, HL-60, with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), has been shown to induce terminal differentiation of the cells into monocytes. We found that this effect involves a rapid increase in phosphorylation of a 17-kDa protein (pp17, pI approximately 5.5) and a 27-kDa protein (pp27, pI approximately 5.5) as detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Within 15 min there was 5- to 7-fold and 3- to 4-fold increase in the phosphorylation of pp17 and pp27, respectively. The rate of phosphorylation remained accelerated over a period of 60-min incubation with PMA. In contrast to these specific changes, there was no effect of PMA on total 32Pi incorporation into HL-60 cells during the same period. The phosphoester bond of the pp17, but not of pp27, revealed a remarkable stability to alkali treatment of the electrophoretic gels. However, phosphoamino acid analysis showed that both pp17 and pp27 proteins are phosphorylated only at serine residues. These two phosphoproteins were located exclusively in the cytosol and were absent from the crude membrane fraction. We further demonstrated that several inactive derivatives of phorbol ester failed to cause an increase in phosphorylation of pp17 and pp27, suggesting that these specific phosphorylation events are intimately related to the induction of differentiation in HL-60 cells by PMA."
https://openalex.org/W1563418303,"Islet-activating protein catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of transducin, a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein that mediates activation of a retinal cyclic GMP-selective phosphodiesterase. Radiolabel from [adenylate-32P]NAD+ was incorporated specifically into the alpha subunit of purified transducin. Maximal levels of incorporation approximated 0.8 mol of ADP-ribose/mol of transducin. A peptide containing the ADP-ribosyl moiety was purified from a tryptic digest of radiolabeled transducin. This peptide was characterized by chemical and enzymatic procedures and by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The primary structure of this peptide was Glu-Asn-Leu-Lys-Asn(ADP-ribose)-Gly-Leu-Phe. It is probable that the peptide originated from the carboxyl terminus of the alpha subunit and that the ADP-ribosyl moiety is attached by an N-glycosidic linkage to the asparagine residue. Transducin associated with retinal disc membranes is also ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin. Cholera toxin and islet-activating protein sequentially catalyze the incorporation of 1.9 mol of ADP-ribose/mol of transducin, indicating two distinct sites of ADP-ribosylation within transducin."
https://openalex.org/W2019206788,Evidence is presented that a tumor-derived transforming growth factor is responsible for stimulating bone resorption and causing hypercalcemia in an animal tumor model of the hypercalcemia of malignancy. Both conditioned medium harvested from cultured tumor cells and tumor extracts of the transplantable rat Leydig cell tumor associated with hypercalcemia contained a macromolecular bone resorbing factor with the chemical characteristics of a tumor-derived transforming growth factor.
https://openalex.org/W2032695528,"In this report we present an experimental scheme that facilitates the study of homologous recombination between closely linked genes in cultured mammalian cells. Two different Xho I linker insertion mutants of the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HTK) gene were introduced into mouse LTK- cells as direct repeats on a plasmid carrying a dominant selectable marker. Following stabilization of these sequences in the recipient cell, selection for TK+ was applied to detect recombinational events between different TK- genes. TK+ segregants were observed at a frequency of 10(-4)-10(-5) in lines harboring both mutant genes. Control lines carrying only one type of mutant HTK gene yielded TK+ cells at frequencies of 10(-7) or less. Physical analysis of the TK+ segregants has revealed the presence of an apparently normal HTK gene that is resistant to Xho l endonuclease digestion in each TK+ line examined. Analyses of the TK gene pairs before and after recombination suggest that at least 50% of the recombinants are the result of nonreciprocal exchanges of genetic information, or gene conversion events."
https://openalex.org/W2037221825,"We have carried out experiments designed to ask if it is possible to convert a secretory protein into an integral membrane protein by appending the membrane spanning domain of an integral membrane protein to its carboxy terminus. We first obtained expression of a cDNA clone encoding rat growth hormone (rGH) in eucaryotic cells, and found that this protein was secreted. We then constructed and expressed a hybrid gene encoding rGH fused to the membrane spanning and cytoplasmic domains of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein (G). This fusion protein was anchored in microsomal membranes in the expected transmembrane configuration. The fusion protein was transported to the Golgi apparatus, and was esterified to palmitic acid, but it was not transported to the cell surface. We suggest that the sorting signal which allows rapid secretion of soluble rGH does not function when the protein is bound to the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2012886993,"Chemically induced differentiation of cultured murine erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells results in a several hundred-fold increase in transcription of the adult mouse globin genes and thus serves as a model for gene activation during erythropoiesis. One approach to study gene regulation in this system has been to analyse the expression of foreign globin genes introduced into MEL cells. By introducing cosmid DNA containing the human adult(beta), fetal(gamma) and embryonic(epsilon)-globin genes, we have shown here that expression of the beta, but not the gamma or epsilon genes, is regulated during MEL differentiation. Regulated expression of the human beta-globin gene was observed when it was introduced either as part of the intact globin gene cluster or as an individual gene with 1.5 kilobases (kb) of 5' flanking DNA. Transcription from a herpes simplex virus (HSV) promoter adjacent to the thymidine kinase (tk) gene is also inducible in MEL cells."

Dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation of these cells caused a dramatic decrease in adhesion to fibronectin that was correlated with synthesis of the erythrocyte glycoprotein ""band III,"" a membrane marker of the differentiated erythrocyte.

https://openalex.org/W1560269480,"The effects of polyamines on the catalytic activity of casein kinase II have been studied. Of the three polyamines tested (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine), spermine was the most effective at stimulating the enzyme. When physiological concentrations of potassium and magnesium were utilized, 50% activation was observed at 0.28 mM spermine or 0.70 mM spermidine. With mixtures of spermine and spermidine at physiological concentrations for the reticulocyte (0.04 and 1.06 mM, respectively), a 2.5-fold stimulation of casein kinase II activity was observed. In general, stimulation of the enzyme was dependent on salt concentration and it was necessary to hold ionic strength constant in order to separate specific activation by the polyamines from general salt activation. Optimum activation by polyamines was observed at low ionic strength and physiological concentrations of Mg2+. When beta-casein and eukaryotic initiation factors 2 or 3 were used as substrates, up to 3.5-fold stimulation of casein kinase II was observed. In the absence of polyamine, half-saturation of the enzyme by Mg2+ was observed at 1-3 mM MgCl2, a concentration much higher than required for ATP-Mg2+ complex formation. This dependence of the enzyme on Mg2+ was greatly diminished in the presence of spermine. Spermine decreased the apparent Km for casein and increased the maximum velocity of the reaction. Spermidine and spermine also effectively reversed inhibition by 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The significant activation by polyamines observed under conditions similar to those measured for the red cell suggest that the polyamines, spermidine and to a lesser extent spermine, function to regulate casein kinase II in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1555311341,"Cultured Leydig cells exhibited time-dependent decreases in the microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzyme activities, 17 alpha-hydroxylase and C17-20 lyase when maintained under standard culture conditions (95% air, 5% CO2). Inclusion of the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethyl sulfoxide in the culture medium, or the reduction of oxygen tension from 19 to 1% O2 was effective in preserving these enzyme activities and the combined effects of low O2 and dimethyl sulfoxide were synergistic. Leydig cells in culture were treated with 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP to induce steroidogenic desensitization which resulted in greater decreases in 17 alpha-hydroxylase and C17-20 lyase activities, as well as a diminished capacity to produce testosterone in response to subsequent acute stimulation with 8-Br-cAMP. Reduction of the oxygen tension from 19 to 1% O2 prevented this enhanced loss of microsomal P-450 activities in desensitized Leydig cells. The activity of delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-isomerase, a microsomal enzyme which is not a P-450 enzyme, was stable in cultures of both control and desensitized Leydig cells under all culture conditions. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that oxygen-mediated damage is responsible for the time-dependent decrease in 17 alpha-hydroxylase and C17-20 lyase activities of control Leydig cells, and is the mechanism by which these microsomal P-450 activities are further decreased in desensitized Leydig cells. Desensitized Leydig cells exhibited a 50 and 70% decrease at 24 and 48 h, respectively, in their ability to produce testosterone in response to subsequent acute stimulation with 8-Br-cAMP, regardless of the culture conditions. Since desensitized Leydig cells cultured at 1% O2 showed no greater loss of enzyme activity than did controls, loss of microsomal P-450 activities is not the cause of the diminished testosterone biosynthetic capacity of desensitized Leydig cells."
https://openalex.org/W1507151313,"Organ cultures of bovine articular cartilage from metacarpophalangeal joints of calf maintain steady state metabolism of cartilage proteoglycans over the course of several weeks. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) depress biosynthesis of proteoglycans in such cultures to approximately 60% of control values after 1-2 days of treatment. A glycolipid from the Salmonella minnesota Re 595 mutant, which lacks the polysaccharide chains of LPS, also depresses proteoglycan synthesis. If LPS is removed from the medium as late as after 12 days of exposure, proteoglycan synthesis returns to control values. Proteoglycans synthesized during the first week of LPS treatment are indistinguishable from those synthesized by control cultures in terms of their hydrodynamic size and the relative amounts of disaccharides released by chondroitin lyase ABC digestion of their glycosaminoglycan chains. However, after 15-18 days of treatment, significant proportions of a smaller proteoglycan are synthesized. For cultures prelabeled with [35S]sulfate, the rate of release of 35S-labeled proteoglycans from the matrix is accelerated approximately 2-fold over control during the first week of LPS treatment. This effect is completely reversed upon removal of LPS from the medium. For cultures prelabeled with [35S]sulfate, approximately 40 and 90% of the 35S-labeled proteoglycans are lost from the matrix after 18 days in control and LPS-treated cultures, respectively. The labeled proteoglycans remaining in the matrix of the control after 18 days were indistinguishable from newly synthesized proteoglycans in terms of hydrodynamic size as were those in 7-day LPS-treated cultures when approximately 40% of the labeled proteoglycans had been lost. Even after 18 days of LPS treatment, more than 60% of the remaining labeled molecules were unchanged. LPS stimulates prostaglandin E2 synthesis in these cultures while indomethacin in the presence of LPS blocks synthesis. However, indomethacin did not alter the metabolism of proteoglycans in either control or LPS-treated cultures, indicating that prostaglandins are not directly involved in regulating proteoglycan metabolism in this system."

https://openalex.org/W2115717009,"Treatment of the promyelocytic leukemic cells, HL-60, with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) results in arrest of growth and terminal differentiation of the cells into macrophages. We have reported that within minutes following exposure of these cells to PMA there is an increase of severalfold in phosphorylation of two cytosol proteins: 17-20 kDa (pp17, pI approximately 5.5) and 27 kDa (pp27, pI approximately 5.5) as detected in the intact cells by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In this report, by analyzing the chase kinetics of 32Pi in cellular proteins, we show that PMA treatment induces a rapid and specific loss of 32Pi from pp17 and pp27. Comparison with kinetics of [3H]leucine loss from these proteins indicates that this effect is due to induction by PMA of rapid turnover of phosphate in pp17 and pp27. This activity persisted in HL-60 for at least 24 h and was also seen in two other cell types studied (U937 leukemia and normal monocytes). The Ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine, had no effect on PMA-induced 32Pi turnover in pp17, while trifluoroperazine, which is known to inhibit protein kinase C, blocked these events and also inhibited other cellular effects of PMA (adherence and growth arrest). Thus, induction of rapid 32Pi turnover in pp17 and pp27 may be an essential early signal in initiating and maintaining cellular effects of PMA. Myosin light chain (20 kDa), another phosphorylated protein, was shown to be not identical with pp17, although of similar Mr."
https://openalex.org/W2066041942,"The utility of somatic cell genetic analysis for the chromosomal localization of genes in mammals is well established. With the development of recombinant DNA probes and efficient blotting techniques that allow visualization of single-copy cellular genes, somatic cell genetics has been extended from the level of phenotypes expressed by whole cells to the level of the cellular genome itself. This extension has proved invaluable for the analysis of genes not readily expressed in somatic cell hybrids and for the study of multigene families, especially pseudogenes dispersed in different chromosomes throughout the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1568437007,"Transducin, a guanine nucleotide-binding protein consisting of two subunits (T alpha and T beta gamma), mediates the signal coupling between rhodopsin and a membrane-bound cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase in retinal rod outer segments. The T alpha subunit is an activator of the phosphodiesterase, and the function of the T beta gamma subunit is to physically link T alpha with photolyzed rhodopsin. In this study, the mechanism of cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of T alpha has been examined in a reconstituted system consisting of purified transducin and stripped rod outer segment membranes. Limited proteolysis of the labeled T alpha with trypsin indicated that the inserted ADP-ribose is located exclusively on a single proteolytic fragment with an apparent molecular weight of 23,000. Maximal incorporation of ADP-ribose was achieved when guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) and T beta gamma were present at concentrations equal to that of T alpha and when rhodopsin was continuously irradiated with visible light in the 400-500 nm region. The stimulating effect of illumination was related to the direct interaction of the retinal chromophore with opsin. These findings strongly suggest that a transient protein complex consisting of T alpha X Gpp(NH)p, T beta gamma, and a photointermediate of rhodopsin is the required substrate for cholera toxin. Single turnover kinetic measurements demonstrated that the ADP-ribosylation of T alpha coincided with the appearance of a population of transducin molecules having a very slow rate of GTP hydrolysis. The hydrolysis rate of the bound GTP for this population was 1.1 X 10(-3)/s, which was 22-fold slower than the rate for the unmodified transducin."
https://openalex.org/W1492048279,"Abstract The properties and functions of the sulfhydryl groups of transducin were examined by 5,5' -dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) titration and N-ethylmaleimide modification. The T beta gamma subunit of transducin contained a total of six free sulfhydryl groups and two were reactive under native conditions. Both reactive sulfhydryl groups were located in the beta polypeptide. The functions of transducin were not affected by the modification of these two sulfhydryl groups. The T alpha subunit of transducin contained three accessible sulfhydryl groups under both native and denaturing conditions. When 1.3 sulfhydryl groups were covalently modified by N-ethylmaleimide, the GTPase activity, the guanosine 5' -(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) uptake, and the rhodopsin-binding property of transducin were inhibited. The binding of Gpp(NH)p to T alpha blocked two of the three sulfhydryl groups from chemical modification and increased the reactivity of the remaining one. Modification of this specific sulfhydryl group of T alpha -Gpp(NH)p inhibited the exchange of the bound Gpp(NH)p for GTP. However, the modified T alpha-Gpp(NH)p was able to activate cGMP phosphodiesterase in solution and on positively charged liposomes. These findings demonstrated that a conformational change of T alpha occurs upon the binding of Gpp(NH)p and a specific sulfhydryl group of T alpha plays an important role in the activation of transducin in retinal rod outer segments."
https://openalex.org/W1642418561,"The mouse hybridoma line T5A7 was derived during studies aimed at mapping human myeloid differentiation antigens. The IgM antibody secreted by this line recognizes an antigen richly expressed on mature myelomonocytic cells and on a subpopulation of lectin-activated human T-lymphocytes (Andrews, R. G., Torok-Storb, B., and Bernstein, I. D. (1983) Blood 62, 124-132). In the present study, we have determined the specificity of T5A7 antibody to be directed to lactosylceramide (Gal beta 1----4Glc beta 1----1 Cer) based on direct and indirect binding assays using a variety of glycolipids with known structures. The antibody did not cross-react with glycolipids having an N-acetyllactosamine terminus, including lactoneotetraosylceramide lactonorhexaosylceramide (i antigen), and lactoisooctaosylceramide (I antigen). The possible contribution of ceramide to the reactivity of lactosylceramide with this antibody was also studied using lactosylceramide preparations having different fatty acid composition."
https://openalex.org/W2069463599,Two micrograms of prostaglandin E2 injected into the lateral ventricle of the brain in rats had the same anorectic and gastrointestinal motor effect as central administration of 0.02 unit of calcitonin. The effects of calcitonin were blocked by a previous intracerebroventricular administration of 0.25 milligram of indomethacin. These results suggest that both anorectic and gastrointestinal motor effects of calcitonin are centrally mediated by the release of prostaglandins.
https://openalex.org/W1901602297,"Mammalian RNA polymerase II was shown to utilize dinucleoside monophosphates for priming of promoter specific RNAs. In a reconstituted system containing purified polymerase and HeLa cell fractions, dinucleotides were incorporated by complementarity with template sequences at the in vivo cap sites of the adenovirus major late and adenovirus early region IV promoters. Incorporation was shown by label transfer experiments and by determining the size of 5'-terminal RNase T1-resistant oligonucleotides. All 16 dinucleotides were tested for priming of RNA chains at the major late promoter. RNA polymerase II initiated with various primers over a contiguous region of 9 bases, centered around the in vivo initiation site. We suggest that the polymerase drifts or oscillates over this region. Using a dinucleotide challenge protocol, the rate of initiation at the major late promoter was measured following preincubation of the template DNA with RNA polymerase II and factors. Initiation with ATP was 90% complete within the 1st min after addition of nucleotide triphosphates. Stimulation of transcription by dinucleotides was not observed, due to this rapid initiation. The 5'-hydroxyl terminus of dinucleotide-primed RNAs remained unmodified. Although transcripts initiated with ATP were rapidly capped in whole cell extracts, ATP-primed RNA synthesized in the reconstituted system retained free 5'-terminal phosphates. Thus, capping was not essential for synthesis of long runoff RNAs."

Kinetic results were obtained with the exogenous substrate, beta-casein and the endogenous substrates, initiation factors (eIF-) 2 and 3. Experiments carried out to determine the interaction between glycerate-2,3-P2, Mg2+, substrate, and casein kinase II led to the following conclusions: 1) glycerate-2,3-P2 inhibition was competitive with respect to the protein substrate and noncompetitive with respect to ATP; 2) inhibition was not caused by depletion of ATP-Mg2+ as a consequence of Mg2+ complexation with glycerate-2,3-P2; 3) the response curve for glycerate-2,3-P2 was cooperative, but the cooperativity decreased as salt concentration increased; 4) glycerate-2,3-P2 inhibition was dependent on Mg2+ concentration up to about 5 mM MgCl2 but did not parallel glycerate-2,3-P2 X Mg2+ complex formation indicating that the Mg2+ dependence was not due to the formation of a glycerate-2,3-P2 X Mg2+ complex; 5) experiments with analogs of glycerate-2,3-P2 showed that the binary phosphate grouping was important in determining inhibition by glycerate-2,3-P2 while the presence of the carboxylate-phosphate pair was much less important; 6) low levels of glycerate-2,3-P2 stimulated phosphorylation of beta-casein, eIF-2, and eIF-3; the extent of stimulation was dependent on the affinity for casein kinase II and the level of the substrate. These effects were observed in the range of glycerate-2,3-P2 concentrations predicted for intracellular fluctuations in this metabolite. Therefore, it was concluded that glycerate-2,3-P2 could function both as an activator and an inhibitor of casein kinase II in the erythroid cell by binding at the substrate binding site."

The release of prostaglandin E2 was associated with induction of theta antigen and was totally inhibited by indomethacin. In contrast, prostaglandin E2 release from spleen cells from intact donors was inhibited by treatment with fraction 5.

https://openalex.org/W1605188033,"Modulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity was studied in a purified, reconstituted system from rat liver microsomes. Cysteine, dithiothreitol, reduced glutathione, and thioredoxin activated the system whereas glutathione disulfide inactivated it. A protein, which stimulated cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in the presence of glutathione or thioredoxin, was purified to apparent homogeneity from rat liver cytosol. It has a minimum Mr of 25,000. The protein had no effect on 12 alpha-hydroxylation of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one or 25-hydroxylation of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol. The cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase stimulatory protein could not be replaced by the thioltransferase-dependent disulfide-reducing system nor by glutathione S-transferase A, B, or C. Neither ATP and MgCl2 nor sodium fluoride had any effect on the activity of the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase stimulatory protein. The results show that purified cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase can be regulated by a mechanism involving disulfide bonds in the cytochrome P-450 molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1498433041,"The intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme rhodanese is quenched by as much as 30% when sulfur is transferred to the free enzyme form, E, giving the sulfur-substituted enzyme, ES.

Fluorescence titration was performed using cyanide to irreversibly remove sulfur from ES. The results show a stoichiometry corresponding to 1 bound sulfur/molecule of the ES form of rhodanese (Mr = 33,000). The fluorescence changes were used to measure the concentrations of E and ES when these were in reversible equilibria induced by interactions with the substrates S2O3(2-) and SO3(2-). These results were compared with an equilibrium constant derived from published kinetic studies for the reaction (formula; see text) The very close agreement between the physical and kinetic methods indicate that there are no significant concentrations of intermediates other than E and ES. Overall, the results are compatible with the formation of a persulfide intermediate in rhodanese catalysis and are consistent with conclusions from x-ray crystallography and absorption spectroscopy. In addition, these procedures offer a facile method to measure equilibria between catalytic intermediates in the rhodanese reaction using functionally relevant concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1994348324,"Recent advances in biotechnology have created many public policy and legal issues, one of the most significant of which is the treatment of biotechnological industrial products, particularly under the patent system. Patents represent one of several types of intellectual property; their ownership confers the right to exclude others from benefitting from the tangible products of a proprietary subject matter. Intellectual property law and its protections will play a major role in the rate at which biotechnology develops in the United States. In this article biotechnological intellectual property issues are reviewed in the context of their underlying legal requirements. The implications of other factors, such as international competition, research funding, and gene ownership, are also considered.Legal ownership of industrial products of biomedical research is discussed as a question of intellectual property rights. Attention is focused on the major role played by the U.S. patent system in establishing such rights, as illustrated by the case of products of recombinant DNA research. Trade secret, copyright, and trademark protections are also considered, as are policy issues such as international competition in the development of biomedical technologies and financing arrangements."

https://openalex.org/W2156130065,"Human placental estradiol 17 beta-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.62) was affinity-labeled at pH 6.3 by 3-bromo[2'-14C]acetoxyestrone and 12 beta-bromo-[2'-14C] acetoxy-4-estrene-3,17-dione (both are substrates) in separate incubations. The affinity-alkylated enzyme samples were then treated separately as described below. Amino acid compositions of both samples revealed radioactive 3-carboxymethylhistidine. Tryptic digests of each sample were prepared, applied to Sephadex G-50, and 3-carboxymethylhistidine-bearing fractions identified. These peptides were further purified by cation exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and paper electrophoresis. The purified, 3-carboxymethylhistidine-bearing peptides labeled by the two steroids had identical electrophoretic mobilities at pH 6.5, 3.5, and 1.9. The amino acid sequence of the radioactive peptide alkylated by 3-bromo[2'-14C]acetoxyesterone was determined as: Leu-Ala-3-[14C]CmHis-Ser-Lys. The smaller quantity of peptide obtained from the inactivation with 12 beta-bromo[2'-14C]acetoxy-4-estrene-3,17-dione precluded the determination of its complete sequence. However, the first 3 residues were found to be Leu-Ala-3-[14C]CmHis and the amino acid composition showed that serine and lysine were also present. It is concluded that the steroid-binding site of human placental estradiol 17 beta-dehydrogenase contains a histidine residue which proximates the upper A-ring region of the steroid as it undergoes the reversible binding step."
https://openalex.org/W1583940786,"The substrate 16-methylene estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17 beta-diol (16-methylene estradiol-17 beta) and its enzyme-generated alkylating product, 3-hydroxy-16-methylene estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-17-one (16-methylene estrone), were synthesized to study the 17 beta- and 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities which coexist in homogeneous enzyme purified from human placental cytosol. 16-Methylene estradiol, an excellent substrate (Km = 8.0 microM; Vmax = 2.8 mumol/mg/min) when enzymatically oxidized to 16-methylene estrone in the presence of NAD+ (256 microM), inactivates simultaneously the 17 beta- and 20 alpha-activities in a time-dependent and irreversible manner following pseudo-first order kinetics (t1/2 = 1.0 h, 100 microM, pH 9.2). 16-Methylene estradiol does not inactivate the enzyme in the absence of NAD+. 16-Methylene estrone (Km = 2.7 microM; Vmax = 2.9 mumol/mg/min) is an affinity alkylator (biomolecular rate constant k'3 = 63.3 liters/mol-s, pH 9.2; KI = 261 microM; k3 = 8.0 X 10(-4) S-1, pH 7.0) which also simultaneously inhibits both activities in an irreversible time-dependent manner (at 25 microM; t1/2 = 7.2 min, pH 9.2; t1/2 = 2.7 h, pH 7.0). Substrates (estradiol-17 beta, estrone, and progesterone) protect against inhibition of enzyme activity by 16-methylene estrone and 16-methylene estradiol. Affinity radioalkylation studies using 16-methylene [6,7-3H]estrone demonstrate that 1 mol of alkylator binds per mol of inactivated enzyme dimer. Thus, 16-methylene estradiol functions as a unique substrate for the enzymatic generation of a powerful affinity alkylator of 17 beta,20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and should be a useful pharmacological tool."
https://openalex.org/W2041392016,"A 60-kilodalton protein was identified in chromatin digested by micrococcal nuclease during retinoic acid-induced differentiation of human leukemia (HL-60) cells to mature-like granulocytes. The protein was not detected in a retinoic acid-resistant variant of the HL-60 cell line treated with retinoic acid, in HL-60 cells induced with dimethyl sulfoxide, or in normal human granulocytes. This protein may have an important role in the regulation of retinoic acid-induced leukemic cell differentiation."

Crystals suitable for x-ray studies were obtained from a binary complex with a transition state analogue, 2-C-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate, and a quaternary complex with 2-C-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate, Mg2+, and HCO-3. Two forms of crystals were obtained in the presence of 2-C-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate. Form B crystals are plates which have orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2 with unit cell dimensions a = 184 A, b = 218 A, and c = 119 A. Form C crystals are tetragonal needles with space group I422 and with cell dimensions a = b = 275 A and c = 178 A. In both forms, the asymmetric unit contains half a molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1516831039,The relationship of folate transport and chemically induced differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells (MELC) was examined. MELC were found to have a carrier-mediated transport system for reduced folates. Chemically induced differentiation of MELC caused a 10-fold decrease in the rate of influx of the folate analog methotrexate. The loss of methotrexate transport during differentiation resulted from a 15-fold decrease in the Vmax for the influx while the Km remained unchanged. Inducer dose dependencies for hemoglobin accumulation and loss of methotrexate influx were similar. A dimethyl sulfoxide-resistant variant of MELC did not express complete accumulation of hemoglobin or loss of methotrexate transport when treated with dimethyl sulfoxide. The decrease of folate influx during differentiation was not a result of: 1) changes in cell densities or growth phase; 2) growth-related changes of the medium; or 3) a direct inhibition of folate influx by the inducers. Loss of folate compound transport correlated with MELC differentiation.
https://openalex.org/W1529066215,"Abstract Magnum from quail oviduct was subfractionated to yield epithelium and tubular glands. The in vitro enzymatic activities involved in sulfated sugar nucleotide biosynthesis were assayed in these isolated tissues. The results demonstrated that the activities necessary for a series of reactions, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine----UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate----UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine 4,6- bisulfate ----UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfate, are located predominantly in the tubular gland. Both time course and pulse-chase studies with [35S]sulfate gave results that were consistent with this reaction scheme. A microsomal preparation from the magnum was shown to be capable of labeling all three sulfate sugar nucleotides with [35S]sulfate upon incubation with UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine and 3'- phosphoadenylyl [35S]sulfate. Again, their relative labeling rates were in the order necessary to allow for a synthesis of sulfated sugar nucleotides in the sequence described above. Furthermore, incubation of the microsomal preparation with UDP-N-[14C]acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate and 3'- phosphoadenylyl sulfate resulted in the formation of UDP-N-[14C]acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfate. Also shown was the existence in the microsomal preparation of a sulfatase specific for the sulfate at position 4 of UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine 4,6- bisulfate . The results, together with those obtained in previous investigations, suggest that the tubular gland of quail oviduct contains a microsomal multienzyme system which catalyzes a series of sulfation and desulfation of N-acetylgalactosamine residues at the nonreducing terminal position of either sugar nucleotides or polysaccharide chains."
https://openalex.org/W1523570426,"The enzyme activity which catalyzes the transfer of sulfate group from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate to C-3 of the galactose residue of galactosylceramide and lactosylceramide has been demonstrated in the Triton X-100 extracts of the microsomal fraction of rat gastric mucosa. The sulfotransferase activity of this fraction in antral mucosa was 1.2-1.3 times greater than that of the body and 19-22 times greater than that of the forestomach. The enzyme did not catalyze the transfer of sulfate to glucosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, and triglucosyl monoalkylmonoacylglycerol. Optimum enzymatic activity was obtained using 0.4% Triton X-100, 33 mM NaF, and 15 mM MgCl2 at a pH of 6.8. The sulfotransferase activity was inhibited by ethanol. With both glycolipid substrates, little inhibition of enzyme activity was obtained up to 0.5 M ethanol. However, higher concentrations of ethanol produced severe inhibitory effect. This inhibition of sulfation of galactosylceramide and lactosylceramide by ethanol was of the competitive type. The apparent KI values were 8.3 X 10(-5) for galactosylceramide and 5.6 X 10(-5) for lactosylceramide."
