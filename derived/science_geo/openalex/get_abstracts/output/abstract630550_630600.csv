https://openalex.org/W2952783314,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major cellular stromal component of many solid tumors. In prostate cancer (PCa), CAFs establish a metabolic symbiosis with PCa cells, contributing to cancer aggressiveness through lactate shuttle. In this study, we report that lactate uptake alters the NAD+/NADH ratio in the cancer cells, which culminates with SIRT1-dependent PGC-1α activation and subsequent enhancement of mitochondrial mass and activity. The high exploitation of mitochondria results in tricarboxylic acid cycle deregulation, accumulation of oncometabolites and in the altered expression of mitochondrial complexes, responsible for superoxide generation. Additionally, cancer cells hijack CAF-derived functional mitochondria through the formation of cellular bridges, a phenomenon that we observed in both in vitro and in vivo PCa models. Our work reveals a crucial function of tumor mitochondria as the energy sensors and transducers of CAF-dependent metabolic reprogramming and underscores the reliance of PCa cells on CAF catabolic activity and mitochondria trading."

These capabilities have important implications for the role of these species in natural and engineered carbon processing. However, the metabolic phenotypes enabling Pseudomonas to utilize mixed substrates remain poorly understood. Here, we employed a multi-omics approach involving stable isotope tracers, metabolomics, fluxomics, and proteomics in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 to investigate the constitutive metabolic network that achieves co-utilization of glucose and benzoate, respectively a monomer of carbohydrate polymers and a derivative of lignin monomers. Despite nearly equal consumption of both substrates, metabolite isotopologues revealed nonuniform assimilation throughout the metabolic network. Gluconeogenic flux of benzoate-derived carbons from the tricarboxylic acid cycle did not reach the upper Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway nor the pentose–phosphate pathway. These latter two pathways were populated exclusively by glucose-derived carbons through a cyclic connection with the Entner–Doudoroff pathway. We integrated the 13C-metabolomics data with physiological parameters for quantitative flux analysis, demonstrating that the metabolic segregation of the substrate carbons optimally sustained biosynthetic flux demands and redox balance. Changes in protein abundance partially predicted the metabolic flux changes in cells grown on the glucose:benzoate mixture versus on glucose alone. Notably, flux magnitude and directionality were also maintained by metabolite levels and regulation of phosphorylation of key metabolic enzymes. These findings provide new insights into the metabolic architecture that affords adaptability of P. putida to divergent carbon substrates and highlight regulatory points at different metabolic nodes that may underlie the high nutritional flexibility of Pseudomonas species.

The STECs most frequently identified by USDA’s Microbiological Data Program (MDP) carried toxin gene subtypes stx1a and/or stx2a. Here we described the genome sequences of 331 STECs isolated from foods regulated by the FDA 2010–2017, and determined their genomic identity, serotype, sequence type, virulence potential, and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. Isolates were selected from the MDP archive, routine food testing by FDA field labs (ORA), and food testing by a contract company. Only 276 (83%) strains were confirmed as STECs by in silico analysis. Foods from which STECs were recovered included cilantro (6%), spinach (25%), lettuce (11%), and flour (9%). Phylogenetic analysis using core genome MLST revealed these STEC genomes were highly variable, with some clustering associated with ST types and serotypes. We detected 95 different sequence types (ST); several ST were previously associated with HUS: ST21 and ST29 (O26:H11), ST11 (O157:H7), ST33 (O91:H14), ST17 (O103:H2), and ST16 (O111:H-). in silico virulome analyses showed ~ 51% of these strains were potentially pathogenic [besides stx gene they also carried eae (25%) or 26% saa (26%)]. Virulence gene prevalence was also determined: stx1 only (19%); stx2 only (66%); and stx1/sxt2 (15%). Our data form a new WGS dataset that can be used to support food safety investigations and monitor the recurrence/emergence of E. coli in foods."

Tau inclusions have been shown to contain a number of proteins, including molecular chaperones, but the consequences of these entrapments are not well established. Here, using a human cell system for seeding-dependent tau aggregation, we demonstrate that the molecular chaperones heat-shock cognate 71-kDa protein (HSC70)/heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70), HSP90, and J-domain co-chaperones are sequestered by tau aggregates. By employing single-cell analysis of protein-folding and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we show that both chaperone-dependent cellular activities are significantly impaired by tau aggregation and can be reversed by treatment with small-molecule regulators of heat-shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) proteostasis that induce the expression of cytosolic chaperones. These results reveal that the sequestration of cytoplasmic molecular chaperones by tau aggregates interferes with two arms of the proteostasis network, likely having profound negative consequences for cellular function.

https://openalex.org/W2929974222,"Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein with an oncofetal pattern of expression shown to be implicated in the development of a variety of malignancies. In this study, we explored the role and mechanisms of IGF2BP1 in melanoma development and progression. In two different in vivo models, we showed that although genetic deletion or shRNA-mediated suppression of IGF2BP1 did not affect primary tumor formation, it drastically suppressed lung metastasis. Here we demonstrated that extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by melanoma cells mediate the effects of IGF2BP1 on metastasis: EVs from the IGF2BP1 knockdown melanoma cells failed to promote metastasis, whereas EVs isolated from IGF2BP1-overexpressed melanoma cells further accelerated EV-induced metastasis. Moreover, the EVs from IGF2BP1 knockdown melanoma cells inhibited fibronectin deposition and accumulation of CD45+ cells in the lungs compared with control EVs, thus blocking the pre-metastatic niche formation potential of EVs. IGF2BP1 knockdown did not affect size, number, or protein/RNA concentration of secreted EVs or their uptake by recipient cells in vitro or in vivo. However, RNA-sequencing and proteomics analysis of the EVs revealed differential expression in a number of mRNA, proteins, and miRNAs. This suggested that IGF2BP1 is intimately involved in the regulation of the cargo of EVs, thereby affecting the pro-metastatic function of melanoma-derived EVs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates the role of RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 in EV-mediated promotion of melanoma metastasis and may provide novel avenues for the development of metastatic inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2927737569,"Cadmium (Cd) contamination in plant-derived food is a big concern. This study examines whether and how Ar/O2 and Ar/Air plasma techniques lead to Cd detoxification in wheat. Treatment with Ar/O2 and Ar/Air changed the seed surface and decreased the pH of seeds as well as the cultivation media. Generally, plants subjected to Cd treatment from seeds treated with Ar/O2and Ar/Air plasma showed considerable progress in morphology and total chlorophyll synthesis compared to Cd-treated wheat, suggesting that plasma technology is effective for Cd detoxification. Furthermore, Ar/O2 and Ar/Air plasma treated plants showed a significant decrease in root and shoot Cd concentration, which is consistent with the reduced expression of Cd transporters in the root (TaLCT1 and TaHMA2) compared with the plants not treated with plasma in response to Cd stress. This Cd inhibition is possibly accomplished by the decrease of pH reducing the bioavailability of Cd in the rhizosphere. These observations are in line with maintenance of total soluble protein along with reduced electrolyte leakage and cell death (%) in root and shoot due to Ar/O2 and Ar/Air treatments. Further, Cd-induced elevated H2O2 or oxidative damage in tissues was mainly diminished through the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT) and their corresponding genes (TaSOD and TaCAT) induced by Ar/O2 and Ar/Air plasma. Grafting results suggest that root originating nitric oxide signal possibly drives the mechanisms of Cd detoxification due to plasma treatment in wheat. These findings provide a novel and eco-friendly use of plasma technology for the mitigation of Cd toxicity in wheat plants."
https://openalex.org/W2931472946,"Radiation therapy is often combined with androgen deprivation therapy in the treatment of aggressive localized prostate cancer. However, castration-resistant disease may not respond to testosterone deprivation approaches. Enzalutamide is a second-generation anti-androgen with high affinity and activity that is used for the treatment of metastatic disease. Although radiosensitization mechanisms are known to be mediated through androgen receptor activity, this project aims to uncover the detailed DNA damage repair factors influenced by enzalutamide using multiple models of androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and castration-resistant human prostate cancer (22Rv1 and DU145). Enzalutamide is able to radiosensitize both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent human prostate cancer models in cell culture and xenografts in mice, as well as a treatment-resistant patient-derived xenograft. The enzalutamide-mediated mechanism of radiosensitization includes delay of DNA repair through temporal prolongation of the repair factor complexes and halting the cell cycle, which results in decreased colony survival. Altogether, these findings support the use of enzalutamide concurrently with radiotherapy to enhance the treatment efficacy for prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2930108678,"Introduction Improvement of arm-hand function and arm-hand skill performance in stroke patients is reported by many authors. However, therapy content often is poorly described, data on actual arm-hand use are scarce, and, as follow-up time often is very short, little information on patients’ mid- and long-term progression is available. Also, outcome data mainly stem from either a general patient group, unstratified for the severity of arm-hand impairment, or a very specific patient group. Objectives To investigate to what extent the rate of improvement or deterioration of actual arm-hand use differs between stroke patients with either a severely, moderately or mildly affected arm-hand, during and after rehabilitation involving a well-defined rehabilitation program. Methods Design: single–armed prospective cohort study. Outcome measure: affected arm-hand use during daily tasks (accelerometry), expressed as ‘Intensity-of arm-hand-use’ and ‘Duration-of-arm-hand-use’ during waking hours. Measurement dates: at admission, clinical discharge and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-discharge. Statistics: Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs. Results Seventy-six patients (63 males); mean age: 57.6 years (sd:10.6); post-stroke time: 29.8 days (sd:20.1) participated. Between baseline and 1-year follow-up, Intensity-of-arm-hand-use on the affected side increased by 51%, 114% and 14% (p < .000) in the mildly, moderately and severely affected patients, respectively. Similarly, Duration-of-arm-hand-use increased by 26%, 220% and 161% (p < .000). Regarding bimanual arm-hand use: Intensity-of-arm-hand-use increased by 44%, 74% and 30% (p < .000), whereas Duration-of-arm-hand-use increased by 10%, 22% and 16% (p < .000). Conclusion Stroke survivors with a severely, moderately or mildly affected arm-hand showed different, though (clinically) important, improvements in actual arm-hand use during the rehabilitation phase. Intensity-of-arm-hand-use and Duration-of-arm-hand-use significantly improved in both unimanual and bimanual tasks/skills. These improvements were maintained until at least 1 year post-discharge."
https://openalex.org/W2933600575,"Malaria parasites repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) primarily through homologous recombination (HR). Here, because the unrepaired DSBs lead to the death of the unicellular parasite Plasmodium falciparum, we investigated its recombinase, PfRad51, as a potential drug target. Undertaking an in silico screening approach, we identified a compound, B02, that docks to the predicted tertiary structure of PfRad51 with high affinity. B02 inhibited a drug-sensitive P. falciparum strain (3D7) and multidrug-resistant parasite (Dd2) in culture, with IC50 values of 8 and 3 μm, respectively. We found that B02 is more potent against these P. falciparum strains than against mammalian cell lines. Our findings also revealed that the antimalarial activity of B02 synergizes with those of two first-line malaria drugs, artemisinin (ART) and chloroquine (CQ), lowering the IC50 values of ART and CQ by 15- and 8-fold, respectively. Our results also provide mechanistic insights into the anti-parasitic activity of B02, indicating that it blocks the ATPase and strand-exchange activities of PfRad51 and abrogates the formation of PfRad51 foci on damaged DNA at chromosomal sites, probably by blocking homomeric interactions of PfRad51 proteins. The B02-mediated PfRad51 disruption led to the accumulation of unrepaired parasitic DNA and rendered parasites more sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, including ART. Our findings provide a rationale for targeting the Plasmodium DSB repair pathway in combination with ART. We propose that identification of a specific inhibitor of HR in Plasmodium may enable investigations of HR’s role in Plasmodium biology, including generation of antigenic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2950845453,"Background Fatigue and depression are frequent and often co-occurring symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) represents a promising tool for disentangling differential associations between depression and fatigue and brain network function and connectivity. In this study we tested for associations between symptoms of fatigue and depression and DMN connectivity in patients with MS. Materials and methods Seventy-four MS patients were included on average 14 months after diagnosis. They underwent MRI scanning of the brain including rs-fMRI, and symptoms of fatigue and depression were assessed with Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI). A principal component analysis (PCA) on FSS and BDI scores was performed, and the component scores were analysed using linear regression models to test for associations with default mode network (DMN) connectivity. Results We observed higher DMN connectivity with higher scores on the primary principal component reflecting common symptom burden for fatigue and depression (Cohen’s f2 = 0.075, t = 2.17, p = 0.03). The secondary principal component reflecting a pattern of low fatigue scores with high scores of depression was associated with lower DMN connectivity (Cohen’s f2 = 0.067, t = -2.1, p = 0.04). Using continuous mean scores of FSS we also observed higher DMN connectivity with higher symptom burden (t = 3.1, p = 0.003), but no significant associations between continuous sum scores of BDI and DMN connectivity (t = 0.8, p = 0.4). Conclusion Multivariate decomposition of FSS and BDI data supported both overlapping and unique manifestation of fatigue and depression in MS patients. Rs-fMRI analyses showed that symptoms of fatigue and depression were reflected in altered DMN connectivity, and that higher DMN activity was seen in MS patients with fatigue even with low depression scores."
https://openalex.org/W2926389658,"Background There have been few available prognostic biomarkers in gastric cancer. We rigorously assessed the clinical relevance of promoter DNA methylation of Cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1) gene, a cancer-specific aberration, in human gastric cancer. Methods Quantitative CDO1 methylation value (TaqMeth V) was initially calculated in 138 gastric cancer patients operated in 2005, and its clinical significance was elucidated. As a subsequent expanded set, 154 gastric cancer patients with pathological stage (pStage) II / III with no postoperative therapy were validated between 2000 and 2010. Results (1) Median TaqMeth V of CDO1 gene methylation of gastric cancer was 25.6, ranging from 0 to 120.9. As pStage progressed, CDO1 TaqMeth V became higher (p < 0.0001). (2) The optimal cut-off value was determined to be 32.6; gastric cancer patients with high CDO1 gene methylation showed a significantly worse prognosis than those with low CDO1 gene methylation (p < 0.0001). (3) A multivariate cox proportional hazards model identified high CDO1 gene methylation (p = 0.033) as an independent prognostic factor. (4) The results were recapitulated in the expanded set in pStage III, where high CDO1 gene methylation group had a significantly worse prognosis than low CDO1 gene methylation group (p = 0.0065). Hematogenous metastasis was unique in pStage III with high CDO1 gene methylation (p = 0.0075). (5) Anchorage independent growth was reduced in several gastric cancer cell lines due to forced expression of the CDO1 gene, suggesting that abnormal CDO1 gene expression may represent distant metastatic ability. Conclusions Promoter DNA hypermethylation of CDO1 gene was rigorously validated as an important prognostic biomarker in primary gastric cancer with specific stage."

In this study, we report the synthesis of a new stable hybrid nanobiocatalyst formed by biomimetic silica (Si) nanoparticles entrapping both Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) (EC 1.11.1.7) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). We have demonstrated that tailoring of the synthetic reagents and post immobilization treatments greatly impacted physical and biocatalytic properties such as an unprecedented ~280 times increase in the half-life time in thermal stability experiments. The optimized nanohybrid biocatalyst that showed superparamagnetic behaviour, was effective in the batch conversion of indole-3-acetic acid, a prodrug used in Direct Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (DEPT). Our system, that was not cytotoxic per se, showed enhanced cytotoxic activity in the presence of the prodrug towards HCT-116, a colorectal cancer cell line. The strategy developed proved to be effective in obtaining a stabilized nanobiocatalyst combining three different organic/inorganic materials with potential in DEPT and other biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W2950140691,"Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a non-structural extracellular matrix protein that regulates interactions between the matrix and neighboring cells. In the cardiovascular system, it is expressed by cardiac fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and at lower levels by ventricular cardiomyocytes. SPARC expression levels are increased upon myocardial injury and also during hypertrophy and fibrosis. We have previously shown that SPARC improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction by regulating post-synthetic procollagen processing, however whether SPARC directly affects cardiomyocyte contraction is still unknown. In this study we demonstrate a novel inotropic function for extracellular SPARC in the healthy heart as well as in the diseased state after myocarditis-induced cardiac dysfunction. We demonstrate SPARC presence on the cardiomyocyte membrane where it is co-localized with the integrin-beta1 and the integrin-linked kinase. Moreover, extracellular SPARC directly increases cardiomyocyte cell shortening ex vivo and cardiac function in vivo, both in healthy myocardium and during coxsackie virus-induced cardiac dysfunction. In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel inotropic function for SPARC in the heart, with a potential therapeutic application when myocyte contractile function is diminished such as that caused by a myocarditis-related cardiac injury."
https://openalex.org/W2935406469,"The aim of this study was to assess the short- and long-term effects of resistance training (RT) with different stability requirements. Fifty-nine men underwent a 3-week familiarization period followed by a 7-week training period. During familiarization, all participants trained four sessions of squats with a Smith machine, free weights and free weights standing on a wobble board. After week-3, participants were randomized into a low (Smith machine), medium (Free-weight) or high (Wobble board) stability RT program, and Control group. All participants were tested pre-, after week-3 and post-intervention. Ten repetition maximum (10RM), rate of force development (RFD), electromyography (EMG) and maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) were tested in all three squat conditions in addition to countermovement jump (CMJ) on stable and unstable surfaces, and muscle thickness. After familiarization, greater 10RM loads (21.8–27.3%), MVIC (7.4–13.5%), RFD (29.7–43.8%) and CMJ (4.9–8.5%) were observed in all conditions. Between week 3 and 10, the Free-weight and Wobble board groups similarly improved 10RM in all conditions. Smith machine group demonstrated greater improvement in the trained exercise than the medium and high stability exercises. All training groups showed similar improvement in muscle thickness, RFD and MVIC. There was no CMJ improvement on the stable surface, but the Wobble board group demonstrated significantly greater improvement on the unstable surface. In conclusion, low, medium or high stability RT resulted in similar improvements in trained and non-trained testing conditions except for greater CMJ on the unstable surface in the Wobble group. Greater 10RM strength in trained than non-trained exercise was only observed in low stability group. Familiarization was associated with substantial improvements in 10RM and CMJ, with greater improvement associated with higher stability requirements. These findings suggest that high stability can increase strength, muscle thickness and explosive measurements similar to training with lower stability."

To gain insight into the poorly understood mechanism of Mfn-mediated membrane fusion, here we characterize a Mitofusin mutant variant etiologically linked to Charcot–Marie–Tooth syndrome. From analysis of mitochondrial structure in cells and mitochondrial fusion in vitro, we found that conversion of Phe-202 to leucine in either Mfn1 or Mfn2 diminishes the fusion activity of heterotypic complexes with both Mfn1 and Mfn2 and abolishes fusion activity of homotypic complexes. Using coimmunoprecipitation and native gel analysis, we further dissect the steps of mitochondrial fusion and demonstrate that the mutant variant has normal tethering activity but impaired higher-order nucleotide-dependent assembly. The defective coupling of tethering to membrane fusion observed here suggests that nucleotide-dependent self-assembly of Mitofusin is required after tethering to promote membrane fusion.

Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative microaerophilic bacterium that infects almost half of the world’s population, leading to gastric disorders and even gastric cancer. H. pylori expresses a series of virulence factors in the host, among which high-temperature requirement A (HpHtrA) is a newly identified serine protease secreted by H. pylori. HpHtrA cleaves the extracellular domain of the epithelial cell surface adhesion protein E-cadherin and disrupts gastric epithelial cell junctions, allowing H. pylori to access the intercellular space. Here we report the first crystal structure of HpHtrA at 3.0 Å resolution. The structure revealed a new type of HtrA protease trimer stabilized by unique N-terminal domain swapping distinct from other known HtrA homologs. We further observed that truncation of the N terminus completely abrogates HpHtrA trimer formation as well as protease activity. In the presence of unfolded substrate, HpHtrA assembled into cage-like 12-mers or 24-mers. Combining crystallographic, biochemical, and mutagenic data, we propose a mechanistic model of how HpHtrA recognizes and cleaves the well-folded E-cadherin substrate.

The current paradigm for treatment of bacterial infection is to eradicate bacterial pathogens with antibiotics. However, rapid evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance among pathogens pose a huge threat to human health worldwide (1Levy S.B. Marshall B.

Therefore, HpHtrA has been considered a potential attractive drug target, given its vital role in the pathogenesis and survival of H. pylori (42Raju R.M. Goldberg A.L. Rubin E.J.

Drug Discov. 2012; 11 (23023677): 777-78910.1038/nrd3846Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). extracellular atomic force microscopy. Here we report the crystal structure of HtrA from H. pylori. The structure reveals a trimeric HpHtrA containing a unique extended N terminus that is absent in other HtrA homologs. Importantly, the N terminus bridges HtrA monomers through domain swapping to stabilize the homotrimer, which has not been identified in other HtrA homologs reported so far. We further demonstrate that the N terminus is also essential for HpHtrA oligomer assembly and protease activity. Moreover, a key residue, Lys328, in the HpHtrA PDZ1 domain was identified to be essential for E-cadherin cleavage but is dispensable for unstructured β-casein substrate. All of these data reveal a novel type of HtrA family protease secreted by the human pathogen H. pylori. Sequence alignments of HtrA homologs from different bacterial species show that HpHtrA has almost the same domain composition as other members, including a signal peptide, a protease domain, and two PDZ domains (Fig. 1A). However, HpHtrA has a relatively extended N-terminal region that contains 19 residues after the signal peptide (18GNIQIQSMPKVKERVSVDP35) (Fig. 1B). To investigate the function of each domain, a series of domain truncation mutants of HpHtrA was constructed and purified (Fig. S1), including a mutant with the N-terminal 19 residues truncated (HpHtrA-ΔN), a mutant with the PDZ2 domain truncated (HpHtrA-ΔPDZ2), and a mutant with both PDZ domains truncated (HpHtrA-ΔPDZ1–2). The protease activity of the mutants was measured using a nonspecific substrate, β-casein, as described previously (32Löwer M. Weydig C. Metzler D. Reuter A. Starzinski-Powitz A. Wessler S. Schneider G. Prediction of extracellular proteases of the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori reveals proteolytic activity of the Hp1018/19 protein HtrA.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3 (18946507)e351010.1371/journal.pone.0003510Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, proteolytic activity of the HpHtrA-ΔPDZ1–2 mutant was completely abolished. In contrast, the HpHtrA-ΔPDZ2 mutant exhibited even higher protease activity compared with the WT HpHtrA (residues from Gly18 to Lys475 without the signal peptide). The results are consistent with previous reports showing that the PDZ1 domain is essential for protease activity and responsible for recognizing and sequestering unfolded substrates through C-terminal residues, whereas the PDZ2 domain is mostly involved in maintaining the hexameric cage of DegP and displays an inhibitory role in chaperone and protease activity (18Jiang J.

Intriguingly, removal of the short N terminus also abrogated HpHtrA protease activity, indicative of an essential role of the N terminus in HpHtrA protease activity. The proteolytic activity of the mutants was subsequently measured using E-cadherin as a substrate. In contrast, all mutants showed decreased proteolytic activity against E-cadherin compared with WT HpHtrA, implying that all of these domains might participate in the E-cadherin cleavage process (Fig. 1D). In the absence of substrate, two EcDegP trimers stack face to face to form an inactive hexamer (23Krojer T. Garrido-Franco M. Huber R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Crystal structure of DegP (HtrA) reveals a new protease-chaperone machine.Nature. 2002; 416 (11919638): 455-45910.1038/416455aCrossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar); EcDegS and EcDegQ, two extensively studied HtrA family proteins in E. coli, were identified as homotrimers (19Bai X.C.

To characterize the conformational state of HpHtrA in the absence of substrate, the oligomerization states of WT-HpHtrA and different mutants were examined by size-exclusion chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2A, WT HpHtrA was eluted at 11.5 ml with a calculated molecular mass of 170 kDa, consistent with a trimeric form of HpHtrA (52 kDa for a monomer). HpHtrA-ΔPDZ2 and HpHtrA-ΔPDZ1–2 were both eluted as trimers with calculated molecular masses of 120 and 90 kDa, respectively. Unexpectedly, HpHtrA-ΔN was eluted at 14.9 ml with a molecular mass of 50 kDa, indicative of a monomeric state of the HpHtrA-ΔN mutant. It has been reported that an autoproteolytic process that results in cleavage of the N-terminal region of EcDegP led to destabilization of a hexamer and formation of a monomer of EcDegP (46Skórko-Glonek J. Zurawa D. Tanfani F. Scirè A. Wawrzynów A. Narkiewicz J. Bertoli E. Lipińska B.

However, the autocleavage process removed the N-terminal 60–80 residues of EcDegP, in contrast to truncation of the N-terminal 19 residues in HpHtrA. The results indicate that the N terminus is essential to stabilize the HpHtrA trimer. On the other hand, the trimeric form of HtrA is likely the minimal functional unit with prominent protease activity because activation of HtrA required the substrate sensor loop from one monomer to interact with the activation loop of a neighboring monomer (28Clausen T. Kaiser M. Huber R. Ehrmann M. HTRA proteases: regulated proteolysis in protein quality control.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Therefore, truncation of the N terminus of HpHtrA disrupted its trimeric form and significantly abolished its protease activity. To further understand how the N terminus stabilizes trimeric HpHtrA, we first determined the crystal structure of full-length WT HpHtrA at a resolution of 3.7 Å (PDB code 5Y2D). The full-length WT HpHtrA crystals grew in trigonal space group R32 and contained one monomeric HpHtrA molecule per asymmetric unit. In the full-length HpHtrA structure, only the protease and PDZ1 domain are well defined with clear electronic density, whereas the PDZ2 domain is partially visible (Fig. 2B). Intriguingly, weak but evident electron density was observed for the extended N terminus of HpHtrA, which is usually disordered and invisible in other HtrA homolog structures (22Krojer T. Sawa J.

To obtain a structure with higher resolution, we crystallized HpHtrA-ΔPDZ2. The HpHtrA-ΔPDZ2 structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to 3.0 Å resolution (PDB code 5Y28). The crystal form belongs to the orthorhombic P222 space group and contains one HpHtrA-ΔPDZ2 trimeric molecule per asymmetric unit. In this structure, each HpHtrA monomer is composed of a protease domain and a C-terminal PDZ1 domain. However, only two PDZ1 domains are visible with clear electron densities among three HpHtrA monomers. Typically, HpHtrA monomers are packed symmetrically around a 3-fold molecular axis as a funnel-like shape, with the protease domain forming the core and the PDZ1 domain extending outward (Fig. 2C). The HpHtrA protease domain is similar to other proteases of the trypsin family, with two perpendicular β barrel lobes and a C-terminal α helix. The backbone root mean square deviation between the EcDegP and HpHtrA protease domains is 0.83 Å. The catalytic triad is located in a crevice"

In this study, by using mitomycin C induction, prophages were found in 23/144 isolates (16.0%), including 13 L. monocytogenes and 10 Listeria spp. isolates, resulting in 28 and 11 induced phages, respectively. These prophage-carrying isolates (lysogens) were obtained from foods and food-related environments presenting 3 common allelic types (ATs) of L. monocytogenes (lineage I, II and IV), 4 ATs of L. innocua and 1 AT of L. welshimeri. The likelihood of prophage-carrying isolates of L. monocytogenes was 14.4 (95% CI: 4.9-35.4), and 18.5 (95% CI: 4.8-50.2) for Listeria spp. The 39 induced phages were classified into 3 lysis groups by the host range test against 9 major serotypes of L. monocytogenes and 5 species of Listeria. Most phages were host-specific with higher ability to lyse L. monocytogenes serotype 4 than other serotypes. The genome size of phages ranged from 35±2 kb to 50±2 kb and belonged to two common phage families, Myoviridae and Siphoviridae. Restriction analysis classified 19 selected phages into 16 restriction profiles, suggesting highly diverse prophages with at least 16 types. This may contribute to the variation in the genomes of Listeria. Information obtained here provides basic knowledge for further study to understand the overall role of prophages in Listeria, including roles in survival or fitness in foods and food processing environments."
https://openalex.org/W2926237998,"Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen of global concern and a leading cause of bacterial infections worldwide. Asymptomatic carriage of S. aureus on the skin and in the anterior nares is common and recognized as a predisposing factor to invasive infection. Transition of S. aureus from the carriage state to that of invasive infection is often accompanied by a temperature upshift from approximately 33°C to 37°C. Such a temperature shift is known in other pathogens to influence gene expression, often resulting in increased production of factors that promote survival or virulence within the host. One mechanism by which bacteria modulate gene expression in response to temperature is by the regulatory activity of RNA-based thermosensors, cis-acting riboregulators that control translation efficiency. This study was designed to identify and characterize RNA-based thermosensors in S. aureus. Initially predicted by in silico analyses of the S. aureus USA300 genome, reporter-based gene expression analyses and site-specific mutagenesis were performed to demonstrate the presence of a functional thermosensor within the 5’ UTR of cidA, a gene implicated in biofilm formation and survival of the pathogen. The nucleic sequence composing the identified thermosensor are sufficient to confer temperature-dependent post-transcriptional regulation, and activity is predictably altered by the introduction of site-specific mutations designed to stabilize or destabilize the structure within the identified thermosensor. The identified regulator is functional in both the native bacterial host S. aureus and in the distally related species Escherichia coli, suggesting that its regulatory activity is independent of host-specific factors. Interestingly, unlike the majority of bacterial RNA-based thermosensors characterized to date, the cidA thermosensor facilitates increased target gene expression at lower temperatures. In addition to the characterization of the first RNA-based thermosensor in the significant pathogen S. aureus, it highlights the diversity of function within this important class of ribo-regulators."

In this study, we found that the expression level of MPIase significantly increases in the cold (<25 °C), whereas that of the SecYEG translocon does not. Using previously created gene-knockout E. coli strains, we also found that either the cdsA or ynbB gene, both encoding rate-limiting enzymes for MPIase biosynthesis, is responsible for the increase in the MPIase expression. Furthermore, using pulse-chase experiments and protein integration assays, we demonstrated that the increase in MPIase levels is important for efficient protein translocation, but not for protein integration.

The CXC motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) is a member of the GPCR superfamily that binds the CXC motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), initiating signaling that is subsequently terminated in part by internalization and lysosomal degradation of CXCR4. The purpose of this study is to define the relative contribution of PKC and GRK to CXCR4 signaling attenuation by studying their effects on CXCR4 lysosomal trafficking and degradation. Our results demonstrate that direct activation of PKC via the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) mimics CXCL12-mediated desensitization, internalization, ubiquitination, and lysosomal trafficking of CXCR4. In agreement, heterologous activation of PKC by stimulating the chemokine receptor CXCR5 with its ligand, CXCL13, also mimics CXCL12-mediated desensitization, internalization, ubiquitination, and lysosomal degradation of CXCR4. Similar to CXCL12, PMA promotes PKC-dependent phosphorylation of serine residues within CXCR4 C-tail that are required for binding and ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4 (atrophin-interacting protein 4). However, inhibition of PKC activity does not alter CXCL12-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of CXCR4, suggesting that other kinases are also required. Accordingly, siRNA-mediated depletion of GRK6 results in decreased degradation and ubiquitination of CXCR4.

https://openalex.org/W2804573241,"We present a novel framework for the automatic discovery and recognition of motion primitives in videos of human activities. Given the 3D pose of a human in a video, human motion primitives are discovered by optimizing the 'motion flux', a quantity which captures the motion variation of a group of skeletal joints. A normalization of the primitives is proposed in order to make them invariant with respect to a subject anatomical variations and data sampling rate. The discovered primitives are unknown and unlabeled and are unsupervisedly collected into classes via a hierarchical non-parametric Bayes mixture model. Once classes are determined and labeled they are further analyzed for establishing models for recognizing discovered primitives. Each primitive model is defined by a set of learned parameters. Given new video data and given the estimated pose of the subject appearing on the video, the motion is segmented into primitives, which are recognized with a probability given according to the parameters of the learned models. Using our framework we build a publicly available dataset of human motion primitives, using sequences taken from well-known motion capture datasets. We expect that our framework, by providing an objective way for discovering and categorizing human motion, will be a useful tool in numerous research fields including video analysis, human inspired motion generation, learning by demonstration, intuitive human-robot interaction, and human behavior analysis."

We assessed the costs and operation dynamics of outreach and promotion efforts for up front Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) testing for pediatric presumptive tuberculosis (TB) patients in four major Indian cities.Xpert test costs were assessed as weighted average per-test costs based on the daily workload dynamics matched by test volume specific Xpert unit cost at each study site. Costs of outreach programs to recruit health providers to refer pediatric patients for Xpert testing were assessed as cost per referral for each quarter based on total program costs and referral data. All costs were assessed in the health service provider's perspective and expressed in 2015 USD.Weighted average per-test costs ranged from $14.71 to $17.81 at the four laboratories assessed. Differences between laboratories were associated with unused testing capacity and/or frequencies of overtime work to cope with increasing demand and same-day testing requirements. Outreach activities generated between 825 and 2,065 Xpert testing referrals on average each quarter across the four study sites, translating into $0.63 to $2.55 per patient referred. Overall outreach costs per referral decreased with time, stabilizing at an average cost of $1.10, and demonstrated a clear association with increased referrals.Xpert test and outreach program costs within and across study sites were mainly driven by the dynamics of Xpert testing demand resulting from the combined outreach activities. However, these increases in demand required considerable overtime work resulting in additional costs and operational challenges at the study laboratories. Therefore, careful laboratory operational adjustment should be evaluated at target areas in parallel to the anticipated demand from the Xpert referral outreach program scale-up in other Indian regions."
https://openalex.org/W2933817918,"Many cells are cultured in media that contains an antibiotic to prevent bacterial contamination. Mycoplasma and other bacterial contamination is a serious problem for those involved in cell culture. Antibiotics in the media helps prevent this contamination and make life easier for the investigators; as performing cell culture experiments in antibiotic free media is difficult and requires vigorous sterile technique. There are many reports of antibiotics causing mitochondrial damage. In this study, we tested the effect of gentamicin in culture media on human mammary epithelial MCF-12A and breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines by real time PCR, immunofluorescent microscopy, lactate assay, DNA damage assay. We found that the addition of gentamicin in media upregulated the gene expression of hypoxia inducer factor 1 alpha (HIF1a), glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters, compared to the cells cultured in gentamicin free media. Gentamicin also increased the lactate production and inhibited mitochondrial membrane potential of the cell lines. Furthermore, the antibiotics in media induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species causing DNA damage. We found an increase of 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine a product of DNA oxidative damage in the media of MCF-12A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. These results showed that normal epithelial and breast cancer cells cultured in the media with gentamicin had increased HIF1a, aerobic glycolysis and DNA oxidative damage. If we use these unhealthy cells in the experiment, all data will be different, compared to cells grown in gentamicin free media. We have studied the detrimental effects of three antibiotics on mitochondrial function in the untransformed MCF-12A human mammary cell line and two human mammary cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MB-MDA-231. The metabolic changes in all cell lines were dramatically different between those in antibiotic free media versus antibiotic containing media. There was a marked difference in gene expression of glycolytic enzymes, reactive oxygen species production and effects on membrane potential. Ironically, our first studies were done in media containing gentamicin, and repeated studies were done in gentamicin free media. The results were very different. The purpose of this report is to emphasize that metabolic cell culture data may be inaccurate because experiments were performed in cell culture media containing antibiotics. We will present evidence to support this theory."
https://openalex.org/W2928229458,"This study aimed to analyse microstructure data on the density and orientation of collagen fibrils in whole eye globes and to propose an effective method for the preparation of data for use in numerical simulations of the eye's biomechanical performance. Wide-angle X-ray scattering was applied to seven healthy ex-vivo human eyes. Each eye was dissected into an anterior and a posterior cup, and radial incisions were used to flatten the tissue before microstructure characterisation. A method was developed to use the microstructure data obtained for the dissected tissue to build realistic 3D maps of fibril density and orientation covering the whole eye globe. At the central cornea, 61.5±2.3% of fibrils were aligned within 45° sectors surrounding the two orthogonal directions. In contrast, more than one-third of the total fibril content was concentrated along the circumferential direction at the limbus (37.0±2.4%) and around the optic nerve head (34.8±2.1%). The insertion locations of the four recti muscles exhibited a preference in the meridional direction near the equator (38.6±3.9%). There was also a significant difference in fibril density between the limbus and other regions (ratio = 1.91±0.45, p <0.01 at the central cornea and ratio = 0.80±0.21, p <0.01 at the posterior pole). Characterisation of collagen fibril density and orientation across the whole ocular surface has been possible but required the use of a technique that involved tissue dissection and hence caused tissue damage. The method presented in this paper aimed to minimise the effect of dissection on the quality of obtained data and was successful in identifying fibril distribution trends that were compatible with earlier studies, which concentrated on localised areas of the ocular globe."

We included patients who had at least one diagnosis of AF and at least one prescription of DOAC between January 1 and December 31, 2014. In 2014, DOACs were reimbursed only to patients with AF unsuitable for warfarin. Appropriate dosing and contraindicated drugs were determined according to the Summary of Product Characteristics for each DOAC. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine the factors contributing to the concomitant use of contraindicated drugs. To assess adherence, we calculated the medication possession ratio (MPR).The percentage of inappropriate dosing was 11.8% among 1,234 patients with AF; it was the highest in rivaroxaban users (16.8%). Contraindicated drugs were prescribed to 236 patients (19.1%). Clinics, smaller healthcare institutions, and outpatient visits were significantly related to contraindicated drug use. The mean MPRs were 0.95, 0.93, and 0.91 for apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, respectively (P = 0.075).Careful monitoring is warranted in patients with AF aged over 65 who were unsuitable for warfarin to reduce the incidence of inappropriate dosing and concomitant use of contraindicated drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2932180987,"Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a complex zoonosis with domestic and sylvatic life-cycles, involving different intermediate and definitive host species. Many previous studies have highlighted the lack of a surveillance system for CE, its persistence in Italy, and endemicity in several Italian regions. Because of the absence of a uniform surveillance program for both humans and animals, disease occurrence is widely underestimated. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of ovine CE in Italy. Survey data on the prevalence of Echinococcus granulosus complex infections in Italian sheep farms from 2010 to 2015 were obtained in collaboration with Regional Veterinary Epidemiology Observatories (OEVRs). Bayesian analysis was performed to estimate the true CE farm prevalence. The prior true CE prevalence was estimated using data from Sardinia. Second, Bayesian modelling of the observed prevalence in different regions and the true prevalence estimation from the first step were used to ultimately estimate the prevalence of ovine CE in Italy. We obtained survey data from 10 OEVRs, covering 14 Italian regions. We observed that the risk of CE infection decreased over the years, and it was strictly correlated with the density of susceptible species. Using Sardinia as prior distribution, where the disease farm prevalence was approximately 19% (95% CI, 18.82-20.02), we estimated that the highest endemic CE farm prevalence was in Basilicata with a value of 12% (95% BCI: 7.49-18.9%) and in Piemonte 7.64%(95% BCI: 4.12-13.04%). Our results provide spatially relevant data crucial for guiding CE control in Italy. Precise information on disease occurrence location would aid in the identification of priority areas for disease control implementation by the authorities. The current underestimation of CE occurrence should urge the Italian and European governments to become aware of the public health importance of CE and implement targeted interventions for high-risk areas."

We leveraged a computational linguistics method in which we sampled news content from the sources our participants most commonly self-reported reading, and then quantified both the extent of news coverage about the marathon and the affective tone of that news coverage. Results revealed that participants experienced greater current distress, greater physiological reactivity to threats, and poorer perceptual sensitivity when recent news coverage of the marathon contained more affectively negative words.

Mutations in human SLMAP have been linked to Brugada syndrome with putative deficits in trafficking of the sodium channel (Nav1.5) to the cell membrane resulting in aberrant electrical activity and heart function. Three main SLMAP isoforms (SLMAP1 (35 kDa), SLMAP2 (45 kDa), and SLMAP3 (91 kDa)) are expressed in myocardium but their precise role remains to be defined. Here we generated transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific expression of the SLMAP3 isoform during postnatal development which present with a significant decrease (20%) in fractional shortening and (11%) in cardiac output at 5 weeks of age. There was a lack of any notable cardiac remodeling (hypertrophy, fibrosis or fetal gene activation) in Tg hearts but the electrocardiogram indicated a significant increase (14%) in the PR interval and a decrease (43%) in the R amplitude. Western blot analysis indicated a selective and significant decrease (55%) in protein levels of Nav1.5 while 45% drop in its transcript levels were detectable by qRT-PCR. Significant decreases in the protein and transcript levels of the calcium transport system of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a/PLN) were also evident in Tg hearts. These data reveal a novel role for SLMAP3 in the selective regulation of important ion transport proteins at the level of gene expression and suggest that it may be a unique target in cardiovascular function and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2925999762,"Objective We analyzed the impact of rapid lactate clearance as an indicator of hemodynamic optimization on the outcome of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) during early post-cardiac arrest care (PCAC). Methods This retrospective analysis was based on a prospective cohort. We selected adult patients with OHCA who achieved a survival event between May 2006 and December 2017. Serum lactate levels were measured at 0 and 6 h after a survival event. The lactate clearance rate was calculated as (lactate at 0 h—lactate at 6 h)/lactate at 0 h. The threshold lactate clearance value for predicting survival to discharge was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Rapid lactate clearance was defined as the lactate clearance above the threshold value or normalization of serum lactate level (<2.0 mmol/L) at 6 h after a survival event. The primary outcome was survival to discharge. Multivariate logistic regression was used to predict survival to discharge. Results We enrolled 335 patients. 145 patients (43.3%) survived at discharge. The threshold value of lactate clearance was ≥34% to predict survival to discharge. After adjustment for confounders, the adjusted odds ratios for no hypotension at both 0 and 6 hours and for the presence of rapid lactate clearance for survival to discharge were 8.018 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.802–22.947) and 2.193 (95% CI 1.263–3.808), respectively. Among patients with early recovery from initial hypotension or with no hypotension events at both 0 and 6 hours, the survival rates were significantly higher in the rapid lactate clearance group than in the non-rapid lactate clearance group. Conclusions During the early PCAC period, a rapid decrease in serum lactate level was an indicator of good outcome. Hemodynamic optimization including not only prevention and immediate correction of hypotension but also rapid lactate clearance should be considered in OHCA patients."

Our aim is to identify the novel calcium-binding proteins in testis. The gene EFCAB2 (GenBank NM_026626.3, NP_080902.1) was not previously examined, and its properties and exact mechanisms of action are unknown. In this study, we performed phylogenetic and structure prediction analyses of EFCAB2, which displays definitive structural features. Additionally, the distribution, localization, and calcium binding ability of mouse EFCAB2 were investigated. Results revealed extensive conservation of EFCAB2 among different eukaryotic orthologs. The constructed 3D model predicted that mouse EFCAB2 contains seven α-helices and two EF-hand motifs. The first EF-hand motif is located in N-terminal, while the second is located in C-terminal. By aligning the 3D structure of Ca2+-binding loops from EFCAB2 with calmodulin, we predicted six residues that might be involved in Ca2+ binding. The distribution of the Efcab2 mRNA, as determined by northern blotting, was detected only in the testis among mouse tissues. Native and recombinant EFCAB2 protein were detected by western blotting as one band at 20 kDa. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses showed its localization specifically in spermatogenic cells from primary spermatocytes to elongate spermatids within the seminiferous epithelium, but neither spermatogonia nor somatic cells were expressed. Moreover, EFCAB2 was specifically localized to the principal piece of cauda epididymal sperm flagellum. Furthermore, the analyses of purified recombinant EFCAB2 by Stains-all, ruthenium red staining, and by applying in vitro autoradiography assay showed that the physiological function of this protein is Ca2+ binding. These results suggested that EFCAB2 might be involved in the control of sperm flagellar movement. Altogether, here we describe about EFCAB2 as a novel calcium-binding protein in mouse testis and sperm."
https://openalex.org/W2931052529,"Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) have been investigated for potential links with human cancer. However, the distribution of somatic nucleotide variations in HERV elements has not been explored in detail. This study aims to identify HERV elements with an over-representation of somatic mutations (hot spots) in cancer patients. Four HERV elements with mutation hotspots were identified that overlap with exons of four human protein coding genes. These hotspots were identified based on the significant over-representation (p<8.62e-4) of non-synonymous single-nucleotide variations (nsSNVs). These genes are TNN (HERV-9/LTR12), OR4K15 (HERV-IP10F/LTR10F), ZNF99 (HERV-W/HERV17/LTR17), and KIR2DL1 (MST/MaLR). In an effort to identify mutations that effect survival, all nsSNVs were further evaluated and it was found that kidney cancer patients with mutation C2270G in ZNF99 have a significantly lower survival rate (hazard ratio = 2.6) compared to those without it. Among HERV elements in the human non-protein coding regions, we found 788 HERVs with significantly elevated numbers of somatic single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) (p<1.60e-5). From this category the top three HERV elements with significantly over-represented SNVs are HERV-H/LTR7, HERV-9/LTR12 and HERV-L/MLT2. Majority of the SNVs in these 788 HERV elements are located in three DNA functional groups: long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (60%), introns (22.2%) and transcriptional factor binding sites (TFBS) (14.8%). This study provides a list of mutational hotspots in HERVs, which could potentially be used as biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2932971325,"Introduction Activity restriction due to fear of falling is a common problem after a stroke. It can lead to deteriorated physical condition, restricted social participation and deprived quality of life. The Survey of Activities and Fear of Falling in the Elderly (SAFE) was developed to assess these difficulties, and its utility has been demonstrated among the older adults and older people with Parkinson’s disease. This study aimed to expand those demonstrations to community-dwelling chronic stroke survivors using a Chinese translation of the instrument. Methods One hundred and eight elderly individuals with a history of stroke completed the Chinese version of the SAFE (SAFE-C). The internal consistency of their responses was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. Twenty of the same subjects were reassessed after a 1-week interval to assess the instrument’s test-retest reliability. Structure validity was examined by exploratory factor analysis. Pearson correlation was used to establish the instrument’s convergent validity with respect to the results from the Chinese version of the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC-C) and the Chinese version of the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL-C). Results The items of the SAFE-C demonstrated excellent internal consistency with a Cronbach’s alphas of 0.90. The SAFE-C also had excellent test-retest reliability with an overall intra-class correlaton coefficient of 0.91. A 1-factor structure termed “fear avoidance circumstances” was identified and it was shown to be consistent with the original measure developed among community-living older people. The correlations between the SAFE-C and the ABC-C (r = -0.68) and the IADL-C (r = -0.57) confirmed the convergent validity. Conclusions Fear avoidance behavior is a homogeneous construct applicable to people with stroke-specific impairments alike. The SAFE-C is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring the level of fear avoidance behavior among community-dwelling stroke survivors. Stroke survivors with good functional mobility revealed a low level of fear and avoidance as measured by the SAFE-C."

However, it is unclear whether such differences are related to access to care. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics of Arab and Jewish children hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis in Israel, a country with universal health insurance. Methods We reviewed the medical records of all children (n = 309) aged less than 24 months who were hospitalized with RSV between 2008 and 2011 in one medical center in Israel. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data were collected. The RSV antigen was identified using immunochromatography. Results The annual incidence of RSV hospitalization was 5.4/1000 and 6.8/1000 among Arab and Jewish children, respectively. Arab patients were significantly younger and had significantly younger parents; most lived in low socioeconomic status towns (93.7% vs. 13.3%; p<0.001) and had more siblings (median 2 vs. 1; p = 0.01) compared to Jewish patients. Disease severity did not differ between the two ethnic groups (p = 0.3). The main predictors of severe illness were having pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.86; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.87–7.97) and history of respiratory diseases (adjusted OR 3.89; 95% CI 1.22–12.38). Conclusions The incidence of hospitalizations for RSV bronchiolitis tended to be higher among Jewish than Arab children, possibly due to differences in health care utilization patterns. Differences between the Jewish and Arab patients in demographic factors likely mirror differences between the groups in the general population. Pneumonia, and not ethnicity, affected the severity of RSV bronchiolitis."
https://openalex.org/W2934594855,"Leeches and oligochaetes comprise a monophyletic group of annelids, the Clitellata, whose reproduction is characterized by simultaneous hermaphroditism. While most clitellate species reproduce by cross-fertilization, self-fertilization has been described within the speciose genus Helobdella. Here we document the reproductive life histories and reproductive capacities for three other Helobdella species. Under laboratory conditions, both H. robusta and H. octatestisaca exhibit uniparental reproduction, apparently reflecting self-fertility, and suggesting that this trait is ancestral for the genus. However, the third species, H. austinensis, seems incapable of reproduction by self-fertilization, so we inferred its reproductive life history by analyzing reproduction in breeding cohorts. Comparing the reproductive parameters for H. robusta reproducing in isolation and in cohorts revealed that reproduction in cohorts is dramatically delayed with respect to that of isolated individuals, and that cohorts of leeches coordinate their cocoon deposition in a manner that is not predicted from the reproductive parameters of individuals reproducing in isolation. Finally, our comparisons of reproductive capacity for individuals versus cohorts for H. robusta, and between different sizes of cohorts for H. austinensis, reveal differences in resource allocation between male and female reproductive roles that are consistent with evolutionary theory."
https://openalex.org/W2934829015,"Bloodstream infection (BSI) is the major cause of mortality in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Causative pathogens in BSI originate from the gut microbiota due to an increase in intestinal permeability, a process known as bacterial translocation (BT). The gut microbiota in physiological conditions is controlled by a large number of immune cells as part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).The aim of the current study was to investigate the mechanism of bacterial translocation in leukemia by identifying and characterizing alterations in the GALT in leukemic mouse model. Our studies revealed a severe impairment of the GALT characterized by a loss of lymphatic cells in ALL, which eventually led to BSI. We identified differentially expressed genes in the intraepithelium and the lamina propria, which may contribute to BT and to the impairment of lymphocyte migration."
https://openalex.org/W2927077906,"Migration of physicians has been a cause for global concern. In China, reforms of the higher education and healthcare systems have led to a shortage of postgraduate training positions relative to the number of medical graduates. Medical graduates opt for non-clinical roles or move abroad to pursue further training and practice opportunities. The impact of this physician migration is not known. This study quantifies where Chinese migrant physicians to the U.S. were educated, where they went to practice, and how these trends have changed over time.We combined data on physician characteristics from the 2008 and 2017 American Medical Association Physician Masterfiles with demographic information from the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates. Using a repeated cross-sectional approach, we reviewed the available data, including citizenship at entry to medical school, medical school attended, practice specialty, and practice location.The number of Chinese-educated physicians (CEPs) to the United States (US) has increased over the past 10 years, from 3,878 in 2008 to 5,355 in 2017 (+38.1%). The majority held Chinese citizenship at entry to medical school (98.4% vs 97.1%) with the remainder being citizens of other East Asian nations. Of the Chinese citizens identified in 2008, 913 (19.3%) attended medical school outside of China; in 2017, 376 (6.7%) attended medical school outside of China, representing a decrease of 58.8%. Overall, in 2017, four Chinese medical schools provided 32.1% of all Chinese-educated physicians in the US. Over 50% of the CEPs were practicing in Internal Medicine, Anatomic/ Clinical Pathology, Anesthesiology, Family Medicine or Neurology. Compared with all IMGs, CEPs are more likely to be Anatomic/ Clinical Pathologists and Anesthesiologists. CEPs were concentrated in several states, including New York, California and Massachusetts. In 2017, a lower proportion of CEPs in the US healthcare workforce were in residency training, compared to 2008 (13.2% vs 22.8%).Unlike trends from some other South Asian countries, the number of CEPs in the US has increased over the past 10 years. Migration trends may vary depending on citizenship and country of medical school training. The majority of Chinese-educated graduates come to the US from relatively few medical schools. Fewer CEPs currently in residency training might indicate lower success rates in securing GME training in the US."

We hypothesized that serum concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL6) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (LpPLA2) were inversely associated with long-term functional decline independently of vascular risk factors, stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) occurring during follow-up.Prospective population based cohort study.The Northern Manhattan Study.Race/ethnically diverse stroke-free individuals in northern Manhattan aged ≥40 years (n = 3298).None.Annual functional assessments with the Barthel index (BI), for a median of 13 years. BI was analyzed as a continuous variable (range 0-100). Baseline demographics, risk factors, and laboratory studies were collected, including IL6 (n = 1679), LpPLA2 mass (n = 1912) and activity (n = 1937). Separate mixed models estimated standardized associations between each biomarker and baseline functional status and change over time, adjusting for demographics, vascular risk factors, social variables, cognition, and depression measured at baseline, and stroke and MI occurring during follow-up.Mean age was 69 (SD 10) years, 35% were male, 53% Hispanic, 74% hypertensive, and 16-24% diabetic. LogIL6 was associated with decline in BI over time (-0.13 points per year, 95% CI -0.24, -0.02) and marginally with baseline BI (-0.20, 95% CI -0.40, 0.01). LpPLA2 activity levels were associated with baseline BI (-0.36, 95% CI -0.68, -0.04) but not change over time, and LpPLA2 mass levels were not associated with either.In this large population-based study, higher serum inflammatory biomarker levels were associated with disability, even when adjusting for baseline covariates and stroke and MI occurring during follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2930864521,"The rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) is a rubber producing crop and contains specialized laticifers. MADS-box genes are a family of transcription factor genes that regulate plant development, especially floral organ and gametophyte development. 97 MADS-box genes were identified in the rubber tree through transcriptomes and genome mining. 93.8% of the genes were mapped onto the genome scaffolds in correspondence to the coverage (93.8%) of current version of sequenced genome. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that type II MADS-box genes have been more actively duplicated than their orthologous genes in Arabidopsis and rice, so that most (70, 72.2%) of the MADS-box genes in the rubber tree belong to type II subfamily. This is a high percentage compared to those in Arabidopsis (43.7%) and rice (56.8%). Moreover, 69 out of 70 type II genes in the rubber tree are transcribed, and they are mostly predominantly expressed in flowers, but some genes are predominantly expressed in laticifers, suggesting their roles in both flower and laticifer development. The number of type I genes in the rubber tree is only 27 (27.8%), a much smaller number compared to their orthologous genes in Arabidopsis (56.3%) and rice (43.2%). At the same time, most of the type I genes (55.6%, 15) in the rubber tree are silent and are probably pseudogenes. The high birth rate and low death rate of type II genes and low birth rate and high death rate of type I genes may corresponds to special developmental requirements in the rubber tree, e.g. the development of laticifer system for biosynthesis of cis-polyisoprene, the rubber. Moreover, atypical MIKC* factors (e.g. HbMADS1 in S-clade, and HbMADS20 in P-clade) are identified. These genes are diverged to typical MIKC* genes in sequences and facilitate functions required in laticifer development and rubber biosynthesis, which is not necessary in Arabidopsis and rice."
https://openalex.org/W2931014337,"This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of night-shift work, and the association of night-shift work with alcohol use disorders(AUDs), as well as with health-related quality of life(HRQL), in Korean adult workers. A total of 26,895 adult workers aged 20-59 years were included in the analysis. AUDs were assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test(AUDIT), and HRQL was measured by the EuroQol-5D questionnaire with five main dimensions. We found an interaction effect between gender and working status on AUDs (p = 0.0065), suggesting that women are more fragile than men in terms of the effects of night work but not regarding HRQL (p = 0.1729). Female night workers had higher risk of AUDs than female day workers (odds ratio(OR): 2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.48-3.38) but this effect was not noted in male night workers (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.69-1.37). Lower HRQL was found in depression dimension for night workers compared to day workers (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.00-1.89), whereas day-night regular shift workers were protected from depression. Risk of AUDs and lower HRQL were identified in female night workers but not in male night workers. This association suggests that women are more fragile than men in terms of the effects of night work."
https://openalex.org/W2934302029,"Phlebotomine sand flies are vectors for several pathogens, with Leishmania being the most important. In Brazil, the main aetiological agent of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) is Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, and Nyssomyia neivai is one of its main vectors in São Paulo state and other areas of South America. Similar to other haematophagous insects, sand flies use volatile compounds called kairomones to locate their hosts for blood meals. A possible increase in the attractiveness of hosts infected with Leishmania infantum to their vectors has been demonstrated. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether L. braziliensis-infected hosts present higher attractiveness to Ny. neivai and to identify differences in the volatile compounds released by infected and uninfected mice.Behavioural experiments in which sand fly females directly fed on infected or uninfected mice showed no significant differences in the attractiveness of the mice or the blood volume ingested. Y-tube olfactometer bioassays also revealed no significant differences in the attractiveness of these hosts to Ny. neivai. No differences were observed in the profiles of the volatile compounds released by the two groups of mice. However, PCA and cluster analysis were able to classify the 31 identified compounds into three clusters according to their abundances. This classification showed a possible role for individual variation in the absence of differences in volatile profiles and attractiveness between infected and uninfected mice.In this first cross-sectional study with an aetiological agent of ACL, there were no statistically significant differences in the attractiveness of infected hosts to their vector."
https://openalex.org/W2934427954,"Saving is an important financial behavior that provides an individual with psychological security and boosts his/her overall sense of well-being. For this reason, scientists and practitioners have attempted to understand why some people save when others do not. One of the most common explanations for this phenomenon is that those individuals who earn more should be more willing to save their money. In line with this logic, people who have more money should be more likely to have savings. Considering the results of prior research, we expected objective financial situation (income) to be positively linked to having savings (i.e., propensity to have savings and the exact amount of savings). At the same time, however, we assumed that subjective financial situation (perception) should also be positively related to these variables. To test our assumptions, we conducted a nationwide representative survey (N = 1048) among Polish respondents, asking them about their objective and subjective financial situation. The results of a regression analysis showed that objective financial situation was indeed significantly positively related to having savings. However, subjective financial situation was also positively correlated with having savings (even when we controlled for objective financial situation and demographic variables). We discuss the implications of the links between objective versus subjective financial situations and having savings."

https://openalex.org/W2929616198,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia), a multi-drug resistant opportunistic pathogen, is associated with nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Preventive and therapeutic strategies for such infections are greatly needed. In this study, sequence alignment analysis revealed that Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) was highly conserved among S. maltophilia strains but shared no significant similarity with human and mouse proteomes. In mice, intranasal immunization with S. maltophilia recombinant OmpA (rOmpA) without additional adjuvant induced sustained mucosal and systemic rOmpA-specific antibody responses. Treatment with rOmpA stimulated significantly higher levels of secretion of IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-17A (All P<0.05) from the primary splenocytes isolated from rOmpA-immunized mice than from the primary splenocytes isolated from PBS-immunized mice. Furthermore, mice immunized with rOmpA showed significantly reduced bacterial burden in the lung and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) 24 hours after intranasal S. maltophilia infection, indicating that immunization with rOmpA may have protective effects against S. maltophilia challenge in mice. Our findings suggest that intranasal immunization with rOmpA may induce mucosal and systemic immune responses in mice, trigger Th1- and Th17-mediated cellular immune responses, and thus stimulate host immune defense against S. maltophilia infection. These results also demonstrate that intranasal vaccination may offer an alternative approach to current strategies since it induces a mucosal as well as a systemic immune response."
