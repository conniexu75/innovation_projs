https://openalex.org/W2066728590,"Intracellular recordings from Limulus eccentric cells suggest that the generator potential arises from the superposition of numerous discrete fluctuations in membrane conductance. If this is so, a relation between frequency response to flickering light and noise characteristics under steady light may be predicted. This prediction is verified experimentally. If a discrete fluctuation model is assumed, the data indicate that increased light has two major effects: (i) the discrete events are strongly light-adapted to smaller size, and (ii) the time course of each event becomes briefer."
https://openalex.org/W2032201733,"A product isolated from thymine irradiated with ultraviolet light in frozen aqueous solution undergoes dehydration on heating with acids. As judged by elemental analysis, mass, ultraviolet, infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, the most probable structures for this compound and its dehydration product, respectively, are 5-hydroxy-6-4′-[5′-methylpyrimidin-2′-one]-dihydrothymine and 6-4′-[5′-methylpyrimidin-2′-one]-thymine. Apparently, this compound is a thymine-thymine adduct and presumably is formed through the rearrangement of an initial photoproduct. Both compounds are closely related to 6-4′-[pyrimidin-2′-one]-thymine which has been isolated from acid hydrolyzates of ultraviolet-irradiated DNA and supposedly is derived from cytosine-thymine adduct. Formation of such adducts between pyrimidine bases is apparently a common photoreaction and may be important to the study of the photochemistry and photobiology of nucleic acids."

https://openalex.org/W2083538887,"The incidence of thyroid carcinoma and of clinically palpable thyroid nodules is compared in three groups of individuals many years after exposure to ionizing radiation in childhood or infancy. The estimated mean cumulative doses to the thyroid gland ranged from 20 rad in the Ann Arbor series irradiated with x-rays as infants for thymic enlargement upward to 1225 rad of mixed radiation (including that from ingested radioiodine) in the Marshallese children. Intermediate between these extremes is the high-risk subgroup in the Rochester series of persons irradiated for thymic enlargement; they received an estimated mean thyroid dose of 335 rad. A plot of the incidence of thyroid nodularity against the total cumulative thyroid dose gives what could be a linear dose response with no threshold or, at least, a threshold below 20 rad. The risk of developing carcinoma in the three studies ranges from 0 to 5.5 cases and that for nodularity 38 to 52 cases per 106 persons exposed per rad (thyroid dose) per year. There is evidence dence from animal experimentation that the biologically effective dose in the case of the Marshallese would have been considerably lower than the cumulative physical dose; hence, the dose response might actually be curvilinear at least in the higher dose range. In view of the uncertainties regarding dose and the assumptions made in my study, the risk values may not be exact; however, these values reflect the trends regarding risks estimated from the best available data in man. Furthermore, the estimated risk values apply only if radiation exposure occurred in childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2002068917,Simultaneous infection of the allantoic sac of the chick embryo with influenza A/equine 1/56 and any of three recombinants derived from human influenza viruses produced stable hybrids with antigens from each parent strain. These hybrids contain the hemagglutinin protein of the equine virus and the neuraminidase of the human strains. The experiments demonstrate genetic homology of human and equine influenza A viruses and suggest the possibility of their recombination in nature.
https://openalex.org/W2024368917,The parasitologic examination of pathologic brain tissue from 16 cases of acute plurulent meningoencephalitis occurring between 1962 and 1965 in northern Bohemia disclosed massive infection of the central nervous system by amoebas of the limax type. The common source was an indoor swimming pool.
https://openalex.org/W1664015717,"The high-frequency temporal behavior of the human visual system has been shown to have some of the properties of a linear low-pass filter. For such a system it is appropriate to consider a repetitive stimulus as having separable Fourier harmonic components. The direct-current component or average luminance is important in that it sets the adaptation level. It is therefore convenient to keep it constant when varying other stimulus parameters, such as frequency or wave form. Of the alternating-current components, only the fundamental is important at high frequencies, the higher harmonics being relatively more attenuated. Any linear low-pass filter system responds in a predictable way to sinusoidal stimulation, whether continuous or of short duration. In the case of the visual system, predictable behavior is found at high frequencies, and it leads to discovery of hitherto unobserved pseudoflash and real flash phenomena. Measurement of a new characteristic time is suggested. At low frequencies the use of half and whole-sinusoidal flashes leads to the discovery of some interesting relations with flicker thresholds, but these remain for future discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2051242897,Internally perfused cells of the marine alga Valonia actively transport potassium from external seawater into the cell vacuole. This active uptake of potassium is reduced by restoring the normal turgor pressure of 1 atmosphere by means of a mercury manometer attached to the internal perfusion system. This inhibition of salt uptake by a small hydrostatic pressure suggests that Valonia and other walled cells may regulate their turgor pressures by adjusting their rates of salt uptake.
https://openalex.org/W1968833692,"Administration of estradiol 17beta to male Xenopus laevis induces the appearance in serum of large amounts of a serum lipophosphoprotein which is not readily removed from the circulation and which can be resolved from other serum components by chromatography on triethylaminoethyl-cellulose. The initial rate of production of serum lipophosphoprotein is independent of the amount of estrogen administered, but the maximum rate of production and the time taken to attain this rate are dose-dependent."

https://openalex.org/W2082839153,"Control mice and those treated with cortisone were exposed to aerosols of viable spores of Aspergillus flavus. Fifteen to 20 minutes later, animals were killed, and alveolar macrophages were obtained by tracheobronchial lavage. Electron-microscopic examination of these cells revealed that, whereas the lysosomes of control macrophages showed extensive attraction and fusion with the phagocytic membranes surrounding spores, the lysosomes of macrophages from animals treated with cortisone revealed little, if any, interaction. This diminished lysosomal response in forming phagocytic vacuoles may be important in the subsequent development of hyphal bronchopneumonia which frequently occurs in cortisone-treated mice exposed to spores of A. flavus."

https://openalex.org/W2019952271,"A SIMPLE method has been developed whereby micrurgy on living cells such as nuclear transplantation and cytoplasmic injection in amoebae can be performed with greater ease and rapidity. The present method differs from those used currently1–4 in that the need for a micro-hook to hold cells and the use of mineral oil (liquid paraffin) to prevent the evaporation of culture medium are eliminated. This is done by placing the cells on an agar surface. When the excess medium surrounding the cells is withdrawn, they remain firmly attached during operations. The agar gel apparently replaces the medium that evaporates, and there is no damage to the cells during the period required for micrurgy. Thus, for example, nuclei are transplanted between amoebae in open drops with a micro-probe alone."

https://openalex.org/W2018078194,"The intensity of a foot shock may be a determinant of the rate at which an avoidance response becomes resistant to disruption by electroconvulsive shock. Mice were trained, one trial a day, in a passive avoidance learning task, with one of three foot-shock intensities. Electroconvulsive shock was administered at various intervals after each trial. At all foot-shock intensities, electroconvulsive shock given 10 seconds after each training trial was eflective in disrupting learning. Where electroconvulsive shock was given at longer intervals after each trial, those animals learning at low intensities of foot shock showed greater impairment of performance than those learning at high intensities."

Interaction between compatible homokaryons, both of which carry the recessive allele dik, leads to the formation of a diploid mycelium that closely resembles the homokaryon in morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2019614295,"The RNA extracted from normal peritoneal macrophages exposed to a linear, random synthetic polypeptide, Glu(60)Ala(30)Tyr(10), initiated an immune response in C57B1/6J mice, although this strain responds very poorly to the antigen itself. From 10 to 150 micrograms of RNA obtained from mouse, rat, or rabbit macrophages was injected intraperitoneally into recipient mice, and specific antibody was detectable by passive hemagglutination 3 to 4 weeks later. Treatment of the RNA with ribonuclease destroyed its ability to initiate a specific immune response. The RNA contained by weight 0.02 percent of the (specific) antigen. The RNA obtained from cells incubated with a second polypeptide, Glu(36)Lys(24)Ala(40), initiated a response specific for this polymer. This RNA even when incubated in vitro with Glu(60)Ala(30)Tyr(10) failed to initiate antibody formation specific for Glu(60)Ala(30)Tyr(10)."

A study of the pharmacology of the action of the toxin on the respiratory system suggests that additional properties may be involved in the respiratory failure—the usual cause of death in ciguatera poisoning.
https://openalex.org/W2010555823,"The reversible nature of the auxin-mediated loosening of the cell wall is shown by the ability of respiratory inhibitors to cause the loss of the auxin-induced increase in wall extensibility without affecting the basal extensibility of the wall. This reversibility makes it unlikely that wall loosening is mediated by enzymes, such as cellulase and beta-glucanase, which degrade polysaccharides, since their action is essentially irreversible."
https://openalex.org/W1964785955,Preliminary studies of the electronic absorption spectra of chlorophyll molecules in aqueous glycolipid and phospholipid dispersions are reported. The spectra show a shift for the red peak of chlorophyll of some 10 millimicrons to longer wavelength compared with the spectrum of chlorophyll in ether. Photochemical studies were carried out with cytochrome c incorporated into the aqueous layers separating the lipid bilayers.

The same injection technique and combined roentgenological, histological, and histometrical investigations also reveal a defect in filling of many small muscular arteries and of most pulmonary arterioles. Hence, the latter pulmonary vessels are assumed to be important in pulmonary ischemia, as demonstrated in the respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn infant."

https://openalex.org/W2057137795,"IT is now more than 60 years since secretin was discovered and since its significance with respect to pancreatic and biliary secretion was recognized1. Later investigations have led to the conclusion that pancreatic juice2 and bile3 can both be considered to be a mixture of two fluid components which are probably secreted by different cells and under independent physiological control; that is, they are made up of a fluid which is rich in electrolytes and a fraction containing a high concentration of the macromolecular secretory products of the exocrine cells. The principal effect of secretin seems to be to stimulate formation of the “electrolyte fraction”, but its precise mode of action is still unknown."
