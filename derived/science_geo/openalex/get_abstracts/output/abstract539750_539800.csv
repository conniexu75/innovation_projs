https://openalex.org/W2143463421,"Biological barriers to drug transport prevent successful accumulation of nanotherapeutics specifically at diseased sites, limiting efficacious responses in disease processes ranging from cancer to inflammation. Although substantial research efforts have aimed to incorporate multiple functionalities and moieties within the overall nanoparticle design, many of these strategies fail to adequately address these barriers. Obstacles, such as nonspecific distribution and inadequate accumulation of therapeutics, remain formidable challenges to drug developers. A reimagining of conventional nanoparticles is needed to successfully negotiate these impediments to drug delivery. Site-specific delivery of therapeutics will remain a distant reality unless nanocarrier design takes into account the majority, if not all, of the biological barriers that a particle encounters upon intravenous administration. By successively addressing each of these barriers, innovative design features can be rationally incorporated that will create a new generation of nanotherapeutics, realizing a paradigmatic shift in nanoparticle-based drug delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2153975567,"The soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440 lacks a functional Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, and glycolysis is known to proceed almost exclusively through the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) route. To investigate the raison d'être of this metabolic arrangement, the distribution of periplasmic and cytoplasmic carbon fluxes was studied in glucose cultures of this bacterium by using 13C-labeled substrates, combined with quantitative physiology experiments, metabolite quantification, and in vitro enzymatic assays under both saturating and non-saturating, quasi in vivo conditions. Metabolic flux analysis demonstrated that 90% of the consumed sugar was converted into gluconate, entering central carbon metabolism as 6-phosphogluconate and further channeled into the ED pathway. Remarkably, about 10% of the triose phosphates were found to be recycled back to form hexose phosphates. This set of reactions merges activities belonging to the ED, the EMP (operating in a gluconeogenic fashion), and the pentose phosphate pathways to form an unforeseen metabolic architecture (EDEMP cycle). Determination of the NADPH balance revealed that the default metabolic state of P. putida KT2440 is characterized by a slight catabolic overproduction of reducing power. Cells growing on glucose thus run a biochemical cycle that favors NADPH formation. Because NADPH is required not only for anabolic functions but also for counteracting different types of environmental stress, such a cyclic operation may contribute to the physiological heftiness of this bacterium in its natural habitats.

The lack of Pfk helps explain why P. putida uses almost exclusively the ED pathway (with a very minor contribution of the PP pathway) for hexose degradation, a phenomenon recognized previously by labeling experiments using 14C-labeled substrates and 13C-based metabolic flux analysis (3Sudarsan S.

In P. putida KT2440, glucose can be either phosphorylated in the cytoplasm by glucokinase (Glk) or oxidized in the periplasm to gluconate and/or 2-ketogluconate (2-KG) by means of glucose dehydrogenase and/or gluconate 2-dehydrogenase (8del Castillo T.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Three convergent pathways further transform these metabolic intermediates into 6-phosphogluconate (6PG) as follows: (i) the phosphorylative branch, in which glucose-6-P (Glc-6-P) is the intermediate via the sequential activity of Glc-6-P 1-dehydrogenase (Zwf) and 6-phosphogluconolactonase; (ii) the direct phosphorylation of gluconate, mediated by gluconokinase (GnuK); and (iii) the 2-KG loop, which involves its transport back into the cytoplasm and its conversion into 2-keto-6-phosphogluconate (2K6PG) via 2-KG kinase (KguK), later reduced to 6PG via 2K6PG reductase (KguD) (Fig. 1). The ED pathway encompasses 6PG dehydratase (Edd), which uses 6PG to yield 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG). This product is in turn split by KDPG aldolase (Eda) into two trioses, pyruvate (Pyr) and glyceraldehyde-3-P (Glc-3-P).

Currently available metabolic models of P. putida KT2440, based on genome annotations, entertain a simple top-down operation of a linear ED pathway (17Nogales J. Palsson B.Ø. Thiele I.

Yet, the co-existence of a complete ED route along with a partial EMP route and three alternative possibilities for glucose uptake (Fig. 1) hint at more complex scenarios. Such conspicuous metabolic plasticity potentially echoes the many survival strategies of this bacterium in its natural habitats (20Martins dos Santos V.A. Heim S. Moore E.R. Strätz M. Timmis K.N.

Microbiol. 2014; 16: 628-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this work, we explored which parts of the aforementioned sugar consumption pathways are active in P. putida KT2440 under specific and controlled environmental conditions. Our strategy encompassed 13C-tracer experiments, combined with the exploration of physiological parameters and the in vitro measurement of enzymatic activities under both saturating and non-saturating, quasi in vivo conditions. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the ED pathway merges its activity with a gluconeogenic operation of the upper EMP and the PP pathway for recycling triose phosphates back into hexose phosphates. This situation gives rise to a metabolic itinerary of key intermediates through what we call the EDEMP cycle (i.e. recruiting activities from the ED, EMP, and PP pathways). This particular metabolic architecture could have evolved to ensure an appropriate supply of NADPH reducing power for coping with the environmental stress that prevails in the natural niches of this bacterium. [1-13C]Glucose and [6-13C]glucose were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Tewksbury, MA), and [U-13C6]glucose was purchased from Sigma. Other chemicals and enzymes used for in vitro assays were obtained from Sigma and Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). P. putida strains used in this work are derivatives of wild-type KT2440 (22Bagdasarian M. Lurz R. Rückert B. Franklin F.C. Bagdasarian M.M. Frey J. Timmis K.N.

Quantitative physiology experiments were carried out in M9 minimal medium (6 g liter−1 Na2HPO4, 3 g liter−1 KH2PO4, 1.4 g liter−1 (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 g liter−1 NaCl, 0.2 g liter−1 MgSO4·7H2O) with 2.5 ml liter−1 of a trace elements solution added (23Nikel P.I. de Lorenzo V.

Media were amended either with glucose (20 mm), gluconate (20 mm), 2-KG (20 mm), succinate (30 mm), or benzoate (17 mm) as the sole carbon and energy source (i.e. 120 mm carbon atoms). Solid media contained 15 g liter−1 agar. Tn5 mutants of P. putida KT2440 (24Duque E. Molina-Henares A.J. de la Torre J. Molina-Henares M.A. del Castillo T. Lam J. Ramos J.L. Ramos J.L. Filloux A.

Growth was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm (A600) after diluting the culture with 9 g liter−1 NaCl when needed. Correlation factors between cell dry weight (CDW) and A600 were determined in batch cultures. All cultures were started with an isolated colony from a fresh LB medium (25Green M.R. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.4th Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2012Google Scholar) plate and suspended in 5 ml of the culture medium in a test tube. After incubating the culture for 18 h, it was used to inoculate fresh medium at an A600 of 0.05. Working cultures were set in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing culture medium up to one-fifth of their nominal volume. Regression analysis was applied during exponential growth to calculate the following: (i) the maximum specific growth rate (μ); (ii) the biomass yield on substrate (YX/S); (iii) the specific rate of glucose or succinate consumption (qS); and (iv) the molar yield of organic acids on glucose (yP/S). CDW was measured by harvesting cells by fast filtration in pre-weighed nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm), washed twice with 9 g liter−1 NaCl, and dried at 105 °C to a constant weight. Succinate was determined with a kit from Megazyme International (Wicklow, Ireland), with the modifications previously described by Nikel et al. (26Nikel P.I. Kim J. de Lorenzo V. Metabolic and regulatory rearrangements underlying glycerol metabolism in Pseudomonas putida KT2440.Environ. Microbiol. 2014; 16: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Glucose was assayed using a commercial kit from R-Biopharm AG (Darmstadt, Germany). Gluconate and 2-KG were measured in culture supernatants as indicated elsewhere (6Latrach Tlemçani L. Corroler D.

Cultures were grown until they reached the mid-exponential phase (A600 = 0.5), at which point the biomass corresponding to 0.5–0.6 mg of CDW was collected in triplicate by fast centrifugation (13,000 × g, 30 s, −4 °C). Bacterial pellets were immediately frozen in liquid N2. Samples were then extracted three times with 0.5 ml of 60% (v/v) ethanol buffered with 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.2) at 78 °C for 1 min. After each extraction step, the biomass was separated by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 1 min. The three liquid extracts were pooled and dried at 120 microbars and then stored at −80 °C. Samples were resuspended in 20 μl of MilliQ water, distributed in sealed 96-well microtiter plates, and injected into a Waters Acquity UPLC (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) with a Waters Acquity T3 column (150 mm × 2.1 mm × 1.8 μm, Waters Corp.) coupled to a Thermo TSQ Quantum Ultra triple quadrupole instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) with electrospray ionization (27Buescher J.M.

Cultures were grown on either 100% [1-13C]glucose or 100% [6-13C]glucose as the sole carbon source, harvested, and processed as described above. The 13C labeling patterns of free intracellular metabolites were determined on the system mentioned above for dihydroxyacetone-P (DHAP), Fru-6-P, FBP, Glc-6-P, 6PG, phosphoenolpyruvate, ribose-5-P, ribulose-5-P, sedoheptulose-7-P, xylulose-5-P, and Pyr as described previously (28Rühl M.

Bioeng. 2012; 109: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The raw data of two independent labeling experiments are available in supplemental Table S1. Cultures were grown on either 100% [1-13C]glucose or a mixture of 20% (w/w) [U-13C6]glucose and 80% (w/w) natural glucose, and 5-ml aliquots of cell broth were harvested at the mid-exponential phase of growth (A600= 0.5) by centrifugation at 1,200 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. Bacterial pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of 9 g liter−1 NaCl, hydrolyzed in 1 ml of 6 m HCl for 24 h at 110 °C, and desiccated overnight at 85 °C under a constant air stream. The hydrolysate was dissolved in 50 μl of 99.8% (w/v) dimethyl formamide and subsequently transferred into a new tube. For derivatization, 30 μl of N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide was added to the hydrolysate and incubated at 85 °C for 60 min. The 13C labeling patterns of proteinogenic amino acids were determined on a 6890N Network GC system with a 5975 inert XL mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA) as described previously (29Fischer E.

Mass distribution vectors of the proteinogenic amino acids were corrected for the natural abundance of all stable isotopes, and the relative metabolic flux ratios (i) oxaloacetate (OAA) from Pyr, (ii) glyoxylate shunt, (iii) phosphoenolpyruvate from OAA, and (iv) the lower and upper bound for Pyr from malate (Table 2) were calculated using the Fiat Flux software (31Zamboni N. Fischer E. Sauer U. FiatFlux–A software for metabolic flux analysis from 13C-glucose experiments.BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 209Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The mass distribution vectors of the free intracellular metabolites were corrected for the natural abundance of all stable isotopes using MatLab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) and novel relative flux ratios (Table 2) were defined and calculated as follows.TABLE 2Selected metabolic flux ratios used for ratio-constrained flux balance analysisMetabolic flux ratioReaction code(s) in Fig. 1Relative value (mean ± S.D.)aStandard deviations for each relative metabolic flux ratio were calculated using the covariance matrices of the respective mass distribution vectors by applying the Gaussian law of error propagation.Glc-6-P from glucosebData were determined from 100% [1-13C]glucose experiments.30.53 ± 0.066PG from Glc-6-PbData were determined from 100% [1-13C]glucose experiments.70.14 ± 0.026PG from Glc-6-PcData were determined from 100% [6-13C]glucose experiments.70.17 ± 0.02Fru-6-P from the PP pathwaycData were determined from 100% [6-13C]glucose experiments.14, 150.23 ± 0.03Pyruvate through the ED pathwaybData were determined from 100% [1-13C]glucose experiments.90.44 ± 0.02Glyoxylate shuntdData were determined from 20% [U-13C6]glucose experiments.31NDOAA from pyruvatedData were determined from 20% [U-13C6]glucose experiments.320.68 ± 0.01Phosphoenolpyruvate from oxaloacetatedData were determined from 20% [U-13C6]glucose experiments.33−0.03 ± 0.03Pyruvate from malate (UB) dData were determined from 20% [U-13C6]glucose experiments.340.92 ± 0.05Pyruvate from malate (LB) dData were determined from 20% [U-13C6]glucose experiments.340.29 ± 0.01a Standard deviations for each relative metabolic flux ratio were calculated using the covariance matrices of the respective mass distribution vectors by applying the Gaussian law of error propagation.b Data were determined from 100% [1-13C]glucose experiments.c Data were determined from 100% [6-13C]glucose experiments.d Data were determined from 20% [U-13C6]glucose experiments. Open table in a new tab The fraction of Glc-6-P originating from glucose was estimated using data from the experiments using 100% [1-13C]glucose as shown in Equation 1, GIc-6-P(1−6)−Fru-6-(1−6)GIc(1−6)−Fru-6-P(1−6)(Eq. 1) and 6PG from Glc-6-P was calculated using data from either 100% [1-13C]glucose or 100% [6-13C] glucose experiments as shown in Equation 2: 6PG(1−6)−Glc(1−6)GIc-6-P(1−6)−Glc(1−6)(Eq. 2) Fru-6-P through the PP pathway using data from 100% [6-13C]glucose experiments is shown in Equation 3, Fru-6-P(1−6)−FBP(1−6)Fru-6-Psim(1−6)−FBP(1−6)(Eq. 3) Fru-6-Psim(1–6) was calculated from the experimentally determined mass distribution vectors of DHAP, ribose-5-P, ribulose-5-P, and xylulose-5-P by assuming that Fru-6-Psim is formed exclusively by the forward reaction flux through the PP pathway. Pyr through the ED pathway was calculated using data from 100% [1-13C]glucose experiments as shown in Equation 4, Pyr(1−3)−uT3P(1−3)1T3P(1−3)−uT3P(1−3)(Eq. 4) The PP pathway yields unlabeled trioses-3-P, whereas the ED pathway yields 50% unlabeled and 50% triose-3-P that is 13C-labeled at position C1. The metabolic model used for net flux analysis was based on a master reaction network with 45 reactions and 33 metabolites. Fluxes were calculated using the following: (i) the stoichiometric reaction matrix; (ii) constraints accounting for the ratios from FiatFlux analysis and additionally for the ratios in the initial steps of glucose catabolism as described above (see also Table 2); (iii) physiological data; and (iv) precursor requirements for biomass. The experimentally determined relative flux ratios were translated into constraints as follows (the reaction numbers, vx, are defined in Fig. 1). The fraction of Glc-6-P originating from glucose (a) was estimated as shown in Equation 5, a=v3v3+v16(Eq. 5) The fraction of Fru-6-P originating through the PP pathway (b) was calculated as shown in Equation 6, b=v14+v15v14+v15+v17(Eq. 6) The fraction of 6PG originating from Glc-6-P (c) was determined as shown in Equation 7, c=v7v4+v6+v7(Eq. 7) For this ratio, the values from the experiments using data from either 100% [1-13C]glucose or [6-13C]glucose were averaged. The fraction of Pyr originating through the ED pathway (d) was determined as shown in Equation 8, d=v9v9+v22+v33+v34(Eq. 8) The upper and lower bounds of Pyr originating from malate (e and f, respectively) were obtained according to Equations 9 and 10, e≥v34v9+v22+v33+v34(Eq. 9) f≥v34v9+v22+v33+v34(Eq. 10) The fraction of OAA originating from Pyr (g) was obtained following Equation 11, g=v32v30+v32(Eq. 11) Finally, the fraction of Pyr originating from OAA (h) was derived from Equation 12, h=v33v9+v22+v33+v34(Eq. 12) The determined linear system of mass balances, flux ratios, quantitative physiology data, and biomass requirements was then solved with the fmincon function from MatLab using the Netto module from FiatFlux (31Zamboni N.

Combined heart rate (HR) and acceleration (ACC) sensing may increase precision of physical activity EE (PAEE) which is the most variable component of total EE (TEE). Objective To evaluate estimates of EE using ACC and HR data with or without individual calibration against doubly-labelled water (DLW) estimates of EE. Design 23 women and 23 men (22–55 yrs, 48–104 kg, 8–46%body fat) underwent 45-min resting EE (REE) measurement and completed a 20-min treadmill test, an 8-min step test, and a 3-min walk test for individual calibration. ACC and HR were monitored and TEE measured over 14 days using DLW. Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) was calculated from food-frequency questionnaire. PAEE (TEE ÷ REE ÷ DIT) and TEE were compared to estimates from ACC and HR using bias, root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation statistics. Results Mean(SD) measured PAEE and TEE were 66(25) kJ·day-1·kg-1, and 12(2.6) MJ·day-1, respectively. Estimated PAEE from ACC was 54(15) kJ·day-1·kg-1 (p<0.001), with RMSE 24 kJ·day-1·kg-1 and correlation r = 0.52. PAEE estimated from HR and ACC+HR with treadmill calibration were 67(42) and 69(25) kJ·day-1·kg-1 (bias non-significant), with RMSE 34 and 20 kJ·day-1·kg-1 and correlations r = 0.58 and r = 0.67, respectively. Similar results were obtained with step-calibrated and walk-calibrated models, whereas non-calibrated models were less precise (RMSE: 37 and 24 kJ·day-1·kg-1, r = 0.40 and r = 0.55). TEE models also had high validity, with biases <5%, and correlations r = 0.71 (ACC), r = 0.66–0.76 (HR), and r = 0.76–0.83 (ACC+HR). Conclusions Both accelerometry and heart rate may be used to estimate EE in adult European men and women, with improved precision if combined and if heart rate is individually calibrated."

A U-HRCT scanner prototype with 0.25 mm x 4 rows and operating at 120 mAs was used. The C-HRCT images were obtained using a 0.5 mm x 16 or 0.5 mm x 64 detector-row CT scanner operating at 150 mAs. Images from both scanners were reconstructed at 0.1-mm intervals; the slice thickness was 0.25 mm for the U-HRCT scanner and 0.5 mm for the C-HRCT scanners. For both scanners, the display field of view was 80 mm. The image noise of each scanner was evaluated using a phantom. U-HRCT and C-HRCT images of 53 images selected from 37 lung nodules were then observed and graded using a 5-point score by 10 board-certified thoracic radiologists. The images were presented to the observers randomly and in a blinded manner.The image noise for U-HRCT (100.87 ± 0.51 Hounsfield units [HU]) was greater than that for C-HRCT (40.41 ± 0.52 HU; P < .0001). The image quality of U-HRCT was graded as superior to that of C-HRCT (P < .0001) for all of the following parameters that were examined: margins of subsolid and solid nodules, edges of solid components and pulmonary vessels in subsolid nodules, air bronchograms, pleural indentations, margins of pulmonary vessels, edges of bronchi, and interlobar fissures.Despite a larger image noise, the prototype U-HRCT scanner had a significantly better image quality than the C-HRCT scanners."
https://openalex.org/W1869365701,"Sphingolipids, a large family of bioactive lipids, are implicated in stress responses, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and other physiological processes. Aberrant plasma levels of sphingolipids contribute to metabolic disease, atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance. They are fairly evenly distributed in high density and apoB-containing lipoproteins (B-lps). Mechanisms involved in the transport of sphingolipids to the plasma are unknown. Here, we investigated the role of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), required for B-lp assembly and secretion, in sphingolipid transport to the plasma. Abetalipoproteinemia patients with deleterious mutations in MTP and absence of B-lps had significantly lower plasma ceramide and sphingomyelin but normal hexosylceramide, lactosylceramide, and different sphingosines compared with unaffected controls. Furthermore, similar differential effects on plasma sphingolipids were seen in liver- and intestine-specific MTP knock-out (L,I-Mttp−/−) mice, suggesting that MTP specifically plays a role in the regulation of plasma ceramide and sphingomyelin. We hypothesized that MTP deficiency may affect either their synthesis or secretion. MTP deficiency had no effect on ceramide and sphingomyelin synthesis but reduced secretion from primary hepatocytes and hepatoma cells. Therefore, MTP is involved in ceramide and sphingomyelin secretion but not in their synthesis. We also found that MTP transferred these lipids between vesicles in vitro. Therefore, we propose that MTP might regulate plasma ceramide and sphingomyelin levels by transferring these lipids to B-lps in the liver and intestine and facilitating their secretion.

Therefore, we propose that MTP might regulate plasma ceramide and sphingomyelin levels by transferring these lipids to B-lps in the liver and intestine and facilitating their secretion. Because of their hydrophobicity, lipids are transported in the aqueous milieu (plasma) of blood associated with proteins (e.g. albumin) or lipoproteins (1Hussain M.M.

Multiple functions of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein.Nutr. Metab. 2012; 9: 14Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies suggest that MTP has two lipid transfer sites as follows: a slow phospholipid transfer site that is hypothesized to be in the N-terminal domain and a fast bulk lipid (triglyceride, phospholipid, and cholesterol ester) transfer site in the C-terminal domain (5Atzel A. Wetterau J.R. Identification of two classes of lipid molecule binding sites on the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15382-15388Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the first step, MTP physically associates with apoB to help translocation across the ER membrane and transfers triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters to nascent apoB to form primordial lipoproteins. In the second step, primordial lipoproteins fuse with lumenal lipid droplets to form mature particles. It is possible that MTP may also participate in the formation of lumenal lipid droplets and their fusion with the primordial particles (3Hussain M.M. Shi J. Dreizen P.

However, the effect of tissue-specific MTP deficiency on plasma and tissue sphingolipids in mice is unknown. Sphingolipids include hundreds of distinct molecular species consisting of the common 18-carbon amino-alcohol backbone, sphingosine. Cellular sphingolipids are biologically active in signaling, differentiation, apoptosis, stress responses, inflammation, atherosclerosis, and lipoprotein metabolism (14Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M.

Ceramides as modulators of cellular and whole-body metabolism.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 4222-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Different species of sphingolipids carry out distinct functions. Ceramides act as tumor suppressors by augmenting apoptosis, autophagy, and cell cycle arrest (17Morad S.A. Cabot M.C. Ceramide-orchestrated signalling in cancer cells.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Their accumulation in the muscle, adipose tissue, and heart increases insulin resistance, inflammation, and atherosclerosis (16Bikman B.T. Summers S.A.

A ceramide-centric view of insulin resistance.Cell Metab. 2012; 15: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In contrast to ceramides, glucosylceramides support cell proliferation and differentiation, and the ablation of genes involved in their synthesis results in embryonic lethality (19Ishibashi Y. Kohyama-Koganeya A. Hirabayashi Y. New insights on glucosylated lipids: metabolism and functions.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1831: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In ob/ob mice, glucosylceramides are increased, and inhibition of their synthesis improves glucose homeostasis, adipocyte function, and insulin sensitivity (19Ishibashi Y. Kohyama-Koganeya A. Hirabayashi Y. New insights on glucosylated lipids: metabolism and functions.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1831: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Atherosclerotic plaques contain large amounts of lactosylceramide, which appear to stimulate smooth muscle cell proliferation and increase expression of adhesion molecules in vascular endothelial cells (20Chatterjee S. Sphingolipids in atherosclerosis and vascular biology.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelins are concentrated in lipid rafts, and these membrane microdomains perform specialized functions such as cell signaling, lipid and protein sorting, cholesterol efflux, and an inflammatory response (21Simons K. Ikonen E. Functional rafts in cell membranes.Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8092) Google Scholar, 22Futerman A.H. Hannun Y.A. The complex life of simple sphingolipids.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). De novo sphingolipid synthesis begins in the ER with the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-ketodihydrosphingosine followed by its reduction to dihydrosphingosine. Dihydrosphingosine is acylated to dihydroceramide and reduced to ceramide. Ceramides are then transported to the Golgi via ceramide transfer protein, four-phosphate adaptor protein 2 (FAPP2), or transport vesicles for the synthesis of sphingomyelin, hexosylceramide, lactosylceramide, and other complex sphingolipids. In the salvage pathway, sphingomyelin is hydrolyzed to sphingosine and transported to the ER for ceramide synthesis. Ceramide can also be generated on the plasma membrane by sphingomyelinases. Although intracellular transport of sphingolipids is widely studied, mechanisms of their transport to the plasma are unknown. Sphingolipids are present in plasma associated with both B-lps and HDLs in nearly equal concentrations (23Dawson G. Kruski A.W. Scanu A.M.

Studies in rat primary hepatocytes have suggested that palmitic acid treatment increases cellular and secreted ceramide (32Merrill Jr., A.H. Lingrell S. Wang E. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Vales T.R.

However, secretion of sphingomyelin was equivocal. Secreted ceramide was mainly associated with VLDL (32Merrill Jr., A.H. Lingrell S. Wang E. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Vales T.R. Vance D.E.

Therefore, it has been speculated that MTP and ABCA1 might play a role in ceramide secretion (33Konstantynowicz-Nowicka K. Harasim E. Baranowski M. Chabowski A.

Acceptor vesicles were prepared by sonicating 10.8 μmol of phosphatidylcholine and 21.6 nmol of triolein in 4.5 ml of buffer II for 40 min. Donor and acceptor vesicles were centrifuged in Beckman Coulter ultracentrifuge for 60 min at 50,000 rpm and 10 °C. The top 4 ml were transferred to a different tube. For blank and totals, 50 μl of donor and 50 μl of acceptor vesicles were incubated with 200 μl of BSA stock (10 mg of fatty acid-free BSA/ml buffer II). To measure MTP activity, 50 μl of donor vesicles, 50 μl of acceptor vesicles, and 200 μl of BSA stock were incubated with purified MTP or tissue homogenates. After 1 h, 200 μl of DE52 (1:1 v/v suspension in buffer containing 15 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4) was added in blank and MTP samples (totals received only the above buffer), mixed for 5 min by rotation, and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g and 4 °C.

Prior work has shown that HER2 associates with α6β4 integrin and syndecan-1 (Sdc1), in which Sdc1 engages the cytoplasmic domain of the β4 integrin subunit allowing HER2-dependent motility and carcinoma cell survival. In contrast, EGFR associates with Sdc4 and the α6β4 integrin, and EGFR-dependent motility depends on cytoplasmic engagement of β4 integrin with Sdc4. However, how HER2 and EGFR assimilate into a complex with the syndecans and integrin, and why kinase capture is syndecan-specific has remained unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that HER2 is captured via a site, comprised of amino acids 210–240, in the extracellular domain of human Sdc1, and EGFR is captured via an extracellular site comprised of amino acids 87–131 in human Sdc4. Binding assays using purified recombinant proteins demonstrate that the interaction between the EGFR family members and the syndecans is direct.

https://openalex.org/W1962592037,"More than 160,000 people are expected to die from invasive urothelial carcinoma (iUC) this year worldwide. Research in relevant animal models is essential to improving iUC management. Naturally-occurring canine iUC closely resembles human iUC in histopathology, metastatic behavior, and treatment response, and could provide a relevant model for human iUC. The molecular characterization of canine iUC, however, has been limited. Work was conducted to compare gene expression array results between tissue samples from iUC and normal bladder in dogs, with comparison to similar expression array data from human iUC and normal bladder in the literature. Considerable similarities between enrichment patterns of genes in canine and human iUC were observed. These included patterns mirroring basal and luminal subtypes initially observed in human breast cancer and more recently noted in human iUC. Canine iUC samples also exhibited enrichment for genes involved in P53 pathways, as has been reported in human iUC. This is particularly relevant as drugs targeting these genes/pathways in other cancers could be repurposed to treat iUC, with dogs providing a model to optimize therapy. As part of the validation of the results and proof of principal for evaluating individualized targeted therapy, the overexpression of EGFR in canine bladder iUC was confirmed. The similarities in gene expression patterns between dogs and humans add considerably to the value of naturally-occurring canine iUC as a relevant and much needed animal model for human iUC. Furthermore, the finding of expression patterns that cross different pathologically-defined cancers could allow studies of dogs with iUC to help optimize cancer management across multiple cancer types. The work is also expected to lead to a better understanding of the biological importance of the gene expression patterns, and the potential application of the cross-species comparisons approach to other cancer types as well."
https://openalex.org/W2140068219,"Understanding movement and dispersal of the common bed bug (Cimex lectularius L.) under field conditions is important in the control of infestations and for managing the spread of bed bugs to new locations. We investigated bed bug movement within and between apartments using mark-release-recapture (m-r-r) technique combined with apartment-wide monitoring using pitfall-style interceptors. Bed bugs were collected, marked, and released in six apartments. The distribution of marked and unmarked bed bugs in these apartments and their 24 neighboring units were monitored over 32 days. Extensive movement of marked bed bugs within and between apartments occurred regardless of the number of bed bugs released or presence/absence of a host. Comparison of marked and unmarked bed bug distributions confirms that the extensive bed bug activity observed was not an artifact of the m-r-r technique used. Marked bed bugs were recovered in apartments neighboring five of six m-r-r apartments. Their dispersal rates at 14 or 15 d were 0.0–5.0%. The estimated number of bed bugs per apartment in the six m-r-r apartments was 2,433–14,291 at 4–7 d after release. Longevity of bed bugs in the absence of a host was recorded in a vacant apartment. Marked large nymphs (3rd– 5th instar), adult females, and adult males continued to be recovered up to 57, 113, and 134 d after host absence, respectively. Among the naturally existing unmarked bed bugs, unfed small nymphs (1st– 2nd instar) were recovered up to 134 d; large nymphs and adults were still found at 155 d when the study ended. Our findings provide important insight into the behavioral ecology of bed bugs in infested apartments and have significant implications in regards to eradication programs and managing the spread of bed bugs within multi-occupancy dwellings."
https://openalex.org/W1856892166,"Brucella abortus S19 and RB51 strains have been successfully used to control bovine brucellosis worldwide; however, currently, most of our understanding of the protective immune response induced by vaccination comes from studies in mice. The aim of this study was to characterize and compare the immune responses induced in cattle prime-immunized with B. abortus S19 or RB51 and revaccinated with RB51. Female calves, aged 4 to 8 months, were vaccinated with either vaccine S19 (0.6-1.2 x 1011 CFU) or RB51 (1.3 x 1010 CFU) on day 0, and revaccinated with RB51 (1.3 x 1010 CFU) on day 365 of the experiment. Characterization of the immune response was performed using serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Blood samples were collected on days 0, 28, 210, 365, 393 and 575 post-immunization. Results showed that S19 and RB51 vaccination induced an immune response characterized by proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells; IFN-ɣ and IL-17A production by CD4+ T-cells; cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells; IL-6 secretion; CD4+ and CD8+ memory cells; antibodies of IgG1 class; and expression of the phenotypes of activation in T-cells. However, the immune response stimulated by S19 compared to RB51 showed higher persistency of IFN-ɣ and CD4+ memory cells, induction of CD21+ memory cells and higher secretion of IL-6. After RB51 revaccination, the immune response was chiefly characterized by increase in IFN-ɣ expression, proliferation of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells and decrease of IL-6 production in both groups. Nevertheless, a different polarization of the immune response, CD4+- or CD8+-dominant, was observed after the booster with RB51 for S19 and RB51 prime-vaccinated animals, respectively. Our results indicate that after prime vaccination both vaccine strains induce a strong and complex Th1 immune response, although after RB51 revaccination the differences between immune profiles induced by prime-vaccination become accentuated."

Comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) stimulates the enzymatic activity of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of TGs to diacylglycerols and free fatty acids. In adipose tissue, protein-protein interactions between CGI-58 and the LD coating protein perilipin 1 restrain the ability of CGI-58 to activate ATGL under basal conditions. Phosphorylation of perilipin 1 disrupts these interactions and mobilizes CGI-58 for the activation of ATGL. We have previously demonstrated that the removal of a peptide at the N terminus (residues 10–31) of CGI-58 abrogates CGI-58 localization to LDs and CGI-58-mediated activation of ATGL. Here, we show that this tryptophan-rich N-terminal peptide serves as an independent LD anchor, with its three tryptophans serving as focal points of the left (harboring Trp21 and Trp25) and right (harboring Trp29) anchor arms. The solution state NMR structure of a peptide comprising the LD anchor bound to dodecylphosphocholine micelles as LD mimic reveals that the left arm forms a concise hydrophobic core comprising tryptophans Trp21 and Trp25 and two adjacent leucines.

https://openalex.org/W1822144452,"During the last years the potential role of in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA as a vehicle to deliver genetic information has come into focus. IVT mRNA could be used for anti-cancer therapies, vaccination purposes, generation of pluripotent stem cells and also for genome engineering or protein replacement. However, the administration of IVT mRNA into the target organ is still challenging. The lung with its large surface area is not only of interest for delivery of genetic information for treatment of e.g. for cystic fibrosis or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, but also for vaccination purposes. Administration of IVT mRNA to the lung can be performed by direct intratracheal instillation or by aerosol inhalation/nebulisation. The latter approach shows a non-invasive tool, although it is not known, if IVT mRNA is resistant during the process of nebulisation. Therefore, we investigated the transfection efficiency of non-nebulised and nebulised IVT mRNA polyplexes and lipoplexes in human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE). A slight reduction in transfection efficiency was observed for lipoplexes (Lipofectamine 2000) in the nebulised part compared to the non-nebulised which can be overcome by increasing the amount of Lipofectamine. However, Lipofectamine was more than three times more efficient in transfecting 16HBE than DMRIE and linear PEI performed almost 10 times better than its branched derivative. By contrast, the nebulisation process did not affect the cationic polymer complexes. Furthermore, aerosolisation of IVT mRNA complexes did neither affect the protein duration nor the toxicity of the cationic complexes. Taken together, these data show that aerosolisation of cationic IVT mRNA complexes constitute a potentially powerful means to transfect cells in the lung with the purpose of protein replacement for genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency or for infectious disease vaccines, while bringing along the advantages of IVT mRNA as compared to pDNA as transfection agent."
https://openalex.org/W1821563019,"Objectives Perivascular spaces are associated with MRI markers of cerebral small vessel disease, including white matter hyperintensities. Although perivascular spaces are considered to be an early MRI marker of cerebral small vessel disease, it is unknown whether they are associated with further progression of MRI markers, especially white matter hyperintensities. We determined the association between perivascular spaces and progression of white matter hyperintensities after 2-year follow-up in lacunar stroke patients. Methods In 118 lacunar stroke patients we obtained brain MRI and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements at baseline, and a follow-up brain MRI 2 years later. We visually graded perivascular spaces and white matter hyperintensities at baseline. Progression of white matter hyperintensities was assessed using a visual white matter hyperintensity change scale. Associations with white matter hyperintensity progression were tested with binary logistic regression analysis. Results Extensive basal ganglia perivascular spaces were associated with progression of white matter hyperintensities (OR 4.29; 95% CI: 1.28–14.32; p<0.05), after adjustment for age, gender, 24-hour blood pressure and vascular risk factors. This association lost significance after additional adjustment for baseline white matter hyperintensities. Centrum semiovale perivascular spaces were not associated with progression of white matter hyperintensities. Conclusions Our study shows that extensive basal ganglia perivascular spaces are associated with progression of white matter hyperintensities in cerebral small vessel disease. However, this association was not independent of baseline white matter hyperintensities. Therefore, presence of white matter hyperintensities at baseline remains an important determinant of further progression of white matter hyperintensities in cerebral small vessel disease."
https://openalex.org/W1771017191,"Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by altered homeostasis of joint cartilage and bone, whose functional properties rely on chondrocytes and osteoblasts, belonging to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). WNT signaling acts as a hub integrating and crosstalking with other signaling pathways leading to the regulation of MSC functions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the existence of a differential signaling between Healthy and OA-MSCs during osteogenesis. Methods MSCs of seven OA patients and six healthy controls were isolated, characterised and expanded. During in vitro osteogenesis, cells were recovered at days 1, 10 and 21. RNA and protein content was obtained. Expression of WNT pathway genes was evaluated using RT-qPCR. Functional studies were also performed to study the MSC osteogenic commitment and functional and post-traslational status of β-catenin and several receptor tyrosine kinases. Results Several genes were downregulated in OA-MSCs during osteogenesis in vitro. These included soluble Wnts, inhibitors, receptors, co-receptors, several kinases and transcription factors. Basal levels of β-catenin were higher in OA-MSCs, but calcium deposition and expression of osteogenic genes was similar between Healthy and OA-MSCs. Interestingly an increased phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) signaling node was present in OA-MSCs. Conclusion Our results point to the existence in OA-MSCs of alterations in expression of Wnt pathway components during in vitro osteogenesis that are partially compensated by post-translational mechanisms modulating the function of other pathways. We also point the relevance of other signaling pathways in OA pathophysiology suggesting their role in the maintenance of joint homeostasis through modulation of MSC osteogenic potential."

This study focused on the role of G0/G1 switch 2 (G0S2) protein, which was previously shown to inhibit the principal TAG hydrolase adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), in the regulation of cardiac lipolysis. Using wild-type and mutant mice, we show the following: (i) G0S2 is expressed in the heart and regulated by the nutritional status with highest expression levels after re-feeding. (ii) Cardiac-specific overexpression of G0S2 inhibits cardiac lipolysis by direct protein-protein interaction with ATGL. This leads to severe cardiac steatosis. The steatotic hearts caused by G0S2 overexpression are less prone to fibrotic remodeling or cardiac dysfunction than hearts with a lipolytic defect due to ATGL deficiency. (iii) Conversely to the phenotype of transgenic mice, G0S2 deficiency results in a de-repression of cardiac lipolysis and decreased cardiac TAG content. We conclude that G0S2 acts as a potent ATGL inhibitor in the heart modulating cardiac substrate utilization by regulating cardiac lipolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2154750154,"Drosophila adults display an unwillingness to enter confined spaces but the behaviors induced by spatial restriction in Drosophila are largely unknown. We developed a protocol for high-throughput analysis of locomotion and characterized features of locomotion in a restricted space. We observed intense and persistent locomotion of flies in small circular arenas (diameter 1.27 cm), whereas locomotion was greatly reduced in large circular arenas (diameter 3.81 cm). The increased locomotion induced by spatial restriction was seen in male flies but not female flies, indicating sexual dimorphism of the response to spatial restriction. In large arenas, male flies increased locomotion in arenas previously occupied by male but not female individuals. In small arenas, such pre-conditioning had no effect on male flies, which showed intense and persistent locomotion similar to that seen in fresh arenas. During locomotion with spatial restriction, wildtype Canton-S males traveled slower and with less variation in speed than the mutant w1118 carrying a null allele of white gene. In addition, wildtype flies showed a stronger preference for the boundary than the mutant in small arenas. Genetic analysis with a series of crosses revealed that the white gene was not associated with the phenotype of boundary preference in wildtype flies."
https://openalex.org/W2156806333,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a range of complex neurodevelopmental conditions principally characterized by dysfunctions linked to mental development. Previous studies have shown that there are more than 1000 genes likely involved in ASD, expressed mainly in brain and highly interconnected among them. We applied whole exome sequencing in Colombian—South American trios. Two missense novel SNVs were found in the same child: ALDH1A3 (RefSeq NM_000693: c.1514T>C (p.I505T)) and FOXN1 (RefSeq NM_003593: c.146C>T (p.S49L)). Gene expression studies reveal that Aldh1a3 and Foxn1 are expressed in ~E13.5 mouse embryonic brain, as well as in adult piriform cortex (PC; ~P30). Conserved Retinoic Acid Response Elements (RAREs) upstream of human ALDH1A3 and FOXN1 and in mouse Aldh1a3 and Foxn1 genes were revealed using bioinformatic approximation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using Retinoid Acid Receptor B (Rarb) as the immunoprecipitation target suggests RA regulation of Aldh1a3 and Foxn1 in mice. Our results frame a possible link of RA regulation in brain to ASD etiology, and a feasible non-additive effect of two apparently unrelated variants in ALDH1A3 and FOXN1 recognizing that every result given by next generation sequencing should be cautiously analyzed, as it might be an incidental finding."
https://openalex.org/W2150670168,"Acquisition of platinum resistance following first line platinum/taxane therapy is commonly observed in ovarian cancer patients and prevents clinical effectiveness. There are few options to prevent platinum resistance; however, demethylating agents have been shown to resensitize patients to platinum therapy thereby demonstrating that DNA methylation is a critical contributor to the development of platinum resistance. We previously reported the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a novel regulator of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity and DNA methylation. Others have shown that EGFR activation is linked to cisplatin treatment and platinum resistance. We hypothesized that cisplatin induced activation of the EGFR mediates changes in DNA methylation associated with the development of platinum resistance. To investigate this, we evaluated EGFR signaling and DNMT activity after acute cisplatin exposure. We also developed an in vitro model of platinum resistance to examine the effects of EGFR inhibition on acquisition of cisplatin resistance. Acute cisplatin treatment activates the EGFR and downstream signaling pathways, and induces an EGFR mediated increase in DNMT activity. Cisplatin resistant cells also showed increased DNMT activity and global methylation. EGFR inhibition during repeated cisplatin treatments generated cells that were more sensitive to cisplatin and did not develop increases in DNA methylation or DNMT activity compared to controls. These findings suggest that activation of EGFR during platinum treatment contributes to the development of platinum resistance. Furthermore, EGFR inhibition may be an effective strategy at attenuating the development of platinum resistance thereby enhancing the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic treatment in ovarian cancer."

The secondary objective was to examine the relation between myocontrol and manual motor control tests.A cohort analytic study.University laboratory.3 groups of 12 able-bodied participants (N = 36).Participants trained the control over their myosignals on 3 consecutive days. Training was done with either myosignal feedback on a computer screen, a virtual myoelectric prosthetic hand or a computer game. Participants performed 2 myocontrol tests and 2 manual motor control tests before the first and after the last training session. They were asked to open and close a virtual prosthetic hand on 3 different velocities as a discrete myocontrol test and followed a line with their myosignals for 30 seconds as a continuous myocontrol test. The motor control tests were a pegboard and grip-force test.Discrete myocontrol test: mean velocities. Continuous myocontrol test: error and error SD. Pegboard test: time to complete. Grip-force test: produced forces.No differences in learning effects on myocontrol were found for the different virtual training methods. Discrete myocontrol ability did not significantly improve as a result of training. Continuous myocontrol ability improved significantly as a result of training, both on average control and variability. All correlations between the motor control and myocontrol test outcome measures were below .50.Three different virtual training methods showed comparable results when learning myocontrol. Continuous myocontrol was improved by training while discrete myocontrol was not. Myocontrol ability could not be predicted by the manual motor control tests."
https://openalex.org/W1850366822,"Excess amounts of heavy metals are important environmental pollutants with significant ecological and nutritional effects. Cdmium (Cd) is of particular concern because of its widespread occurrence and high toxicity. We conducted physiological and proteomic analyses to improve our understanding of the responses of Populus yunnanensis to Cd stress. The plantlets experienced two apparent stages in their response to Cd stress. During the first stage, transiently induced defense-response molecules, photosynthesis- and energy-associated proteins, antioxidant enzymes and heat shock proteins (HSPs) accumulated to enhance protein stability and establish a new cellular homeostasis. This activity explains why plant photosynthetic capability during this period barely changed. During the second stage, a decline of ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) and HSP levels led to imbalance of the plant photosynthetic system. Additionally, the expression of Mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MPK3), Mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MPK6) and a homeobox-leucine zipper protein was higher in the second stage. Higher expression of caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) may regulate plant cell wall synthesis for greater Cd storage. These genes may be candidates for further research and use in genetic manipulation of poplar tolerance to Cd stress."
https://openalex.org/W2170682191,"Player tracking data represents a revolutionary new data source for basketball analysis, in which essentially every aspect of a player's performance is tracked and can be analyzed numerically. We suggest a way by which this data set, when coupled with a network-style model of the offense that relates players' skills to the team's success at running different plays, can be used to automatically learn players' skills and predict the performance of untested 5-man lineups in a way that accounts for the interaction between players' respective skill sets. After developing a general analysis procedure, we present as an example a specific implementation of our method using a simplified network model. While player tracking data is not yet available in the public domain, we evaluate our model using simulated data and show that player skills can be accurately inferred by a simple statistical inference scheme. Finally, we use the model to analyze games from the 2011 playoff series between the Memphis Grizzlies and the Oklahoma City Thunder and we show that, even with a very limited data set, the model can consistently describe a player's interactions with a given lineup based only on his performance with a different lineup."
https://openalex.org/W1840292713,"Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is a measure of the minimum energy requirements of an animal at rest, and can give an indication of the costs of somatic maintenance. We measured RMR of free-ranging European badgers (Meles meles) to determine whether differences were related to sex, age and season. Badgers were captured in live-traps and placed individually within a metabolic chamber maintained at 20 ± 1°C. Resting metabolic rate was determined using an open-circuit respirometry system. Season was significantly correlated with RMR, but no effects of age or sex were detected. Summer RMR values were significantly higher than winter values (mass-adjusted mean ± standard error: 2366 ± 70 kJ⋅d(-1); 1845 ± 109 kJ⋅d(-1), respectively), with the percentage difference being 24.7%. While under the influence of anaesthesia, RMR was estimated to be 25.5% lower than the combined average value before administration, and after recovery from anaesthesia. Resting metabolic rate during the autumn and winter was not significantly different to allometric predictions of basal metabolic rate for mustelid species weighing 1 kg or greater, but badgers measured in the summer had values that were higher than predicted. Results suggest that a seasonal reduction in RMR coincides with apparent reductions in physical activity and body temperature as part of the overwintering strategy ('winter lethargy') in badgers. This study contributes to an expanding dataset on the ecophysiology of medium-sized carnivores, and emphasises the importance of considering season when making predictions of metabolic rate."
https://openalex.org/W2161148585,"One of the challenging questions in cancer biology is how a normal cell transforms into a cancer cell. There is strong evidence that specific chromosomal translocations are a key element in this transformation process. Our studies focus on understanding the developmental mechanism by which a normal stem or progenitor cell transforms into leukemia. Here we used engineered nucleases to induce simultaneous specific double strand breaks in the MLL gene and two different known translocation partners (AF4 and AF9), which resulted in specific chromosomal translocations in K562 cells as well as primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The initiation of a specific MLL translocation in a small number of HSPCs likely mimics the leukemia-initiating event that occurs in patients. In our studies, the creation of specific MLL translocations in CD34+ cells was not sufficient to transform cells in vitro. Rather, a variety of fates was observed for translocation positive cells including cell loss over time, a transient proliferative advantage followed by loss of the clone, or a persistent proliferative advantage. These studies highlight the application of genome engineering tools in primary human HSPCs to induce and prospectively study the consequences of initiating translocation events in leukemia pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1774608226,"Allergy is inversely related to glioma risk. To determine whether prediagnostic allergy-related serum proteins are associated with glioma, we conducted a nested case-control study of seven cytokines (IL4, IL13, IL5, IL6, IL10, IFNG, TGFB2), two soluble cytokine receptors (sIL4RA, sIL13RA2) and three allergy-related transcription factors (FOXP3, STAT3, STAT6) using serum specimens from the Janus Serum Bank Cohort in Oslo, Norway. Blood donors subsequently diagnosed with glioma (n = 487) were matched to controls (n = 487) on age and date of blood draw and sex. We first estimated individual effects of the 12 serum proteins and then interactions between IL4 and IL13 and their receptors using conditional logistic regression. We next tested equality of case-control inter-correlations among the 12 serum proteins. We found that TGFB2 is inversely related to glioblastoma (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.87, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)) = 0.76, 0.98). In addition, ≤ 5 years before diagnosis, we observed associations between IL4 (OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.66, 1.01), sIL4RA (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.65, 1.00), their interaction (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.12) and glioblastoma. This interaction was apparent > 20 years before diagnosis (IL4-sIL4RA OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.37). Findings for glioma were similar. Case correlations were different from control correlations stratified on time before diagnosis. Five years or less before diagnosis, correlations among case serum proteins were weaker than were those among controls. Our findings suggest that IL4 and sIL4RA reduce glioma risk long before diagnosis and early gliomagenesis affects circulating immune function proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1777842426,"In certain image acquisitions processes, like in fluorescence microscopy or astronomy, only a limited number of photons can be collected due to various physical constraints. The resulting images suffer from signal dependent noise, which can be modeled as a Poisson distribution, and a low signal-to-noise ratio. However, the majority of research on noise reduction algorithms focuses on signal independent Gaussian noise. In this paper, we model noise as a combination of Poisson and Gaussian probability distributions to construct a more accurate model and adopt the contourlet transform which provides a sparse representation of the directional components in images. We also apply hidden Markov models with a framework that neatly describes the spatial and interscale dependencies which are the properties of transformation coefficients of natural images. In this paper, an effective denoising algorithm for Poisson-Gaussian noise is proposed using the contourlet transform, hidden Markov models and noise estimation in the transform domain. We supplement the algorithm by cycle spinning and Wiener filtering for further improvements. We finally show experimental results with simulations and fluorescence microscopy images which demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed approach."
https://openalex.org/W2152372349,"Although shoulder apprehension is an established clinical finding and is important for the prevention of shoulder dislocation, how this subjective perception is evoked remains unclear. We elucidated the functional neuroplasticity associated with apprehension in patients with recurrent anterior shoulder instability (RSI) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twelve healthy volunteers and 14 patients with right-sided RSI performed a motor imagery task and a passive shoulder motion task. Brain activity was compared between healthy participants and those with RSI and was correlated with the apprehension intensity reported by participants after each task. Compared to healthy volunteers, participants with RSI exhibited decreased brain activity in the motor network, but increased activity in the hippocampus and amygdala. During the passive motion task, participants with RSI exhibited decreased activity in the left premotor and primary motor/somatosensory areas. Furthermore, brain activity was correlated with apprehension intensity in the left amygdala and left thalamus during the motor imagery task (memory-induced), while a correlation between apprehension intensity and brain activity was found in the left prefrontal cortex during the passive motion task (instability-induced). Our findings provide insight into the pathophysiology of RSI by identifying its associated neural alterations. We elucidated that shoulder apprehension was induced by two different factors, namely instability and memory."
https://openalex.org/W2137009871,"Cephalopods are famous for their ability to change color and pattern rapidly for signaling and camouflage. They have keen eyes and remarkable vision, made possible by photoreceptors in their retinas. External to the eyes, photoreceptors also exist in parolfactory vesicles and some light organs, where they function using a rhodopsin protein that is identical to that expressed in the retina. Furthermore, dermal chromatophore organs contain rhodopsin and other components of phototransduction (including retinochrome, a photoisomerase first found in the retina), suggesting that they are photoreceptive. In this study, we used a modified whole-mount immunohistochemical technique to explore rhodopsin and retinochrome expression in a number of tissues and organs in the longfin squid, Doryteuthis pealeii. We found that fin central muscles, hair cells (epithelial primary sensory neurons), arm axial ganglia, and sucker peduncle nerves all express rhodopsin and retinochrome proteins. Our findings indicate that these animals possess an unexpected diversity of extraocular photoreceptors and suggest that extraocular photoreception using visual opsins and visual phototransduction machinery is far more widespread throughout cephalopod tissues than previously recognized."

Vitamin A and related retinoids influence many aspects of immunity. In this study, we demonstrated that treatment with a combination of Zn and atRA contributes to host resistance against infection by Listeria monocytogenes. Pretreatment with Zn and atRA enhanced resistance against L. monocytogenes infection in mice and treatment with both Zn and atRA showed a higher protective effect than treatment with either alone. Supplementation with Zn, atRA or their combination decreased the number of L. monocytogenes present in target organs. In vitro, supplementation increased the bacterial uptake by macrophage cells and reduced the replication of L. monocytogenes. Our results suggest that the combination of Zn and atRA has a great bacteriostatic impact on L. monocytogenes and its infection."
https://openalex.org/W2145307831,"In-situ oil sands development (ISD) involves a network of facilities, wells, roads and pipelines to extract and transport subsurface bitumen. This technology is rapidly expanding and there is uncertainty whether ISDs restrict animal movement, leading to increased extinction probabilities for some wide-ranging species. Here we test for effects of simulated future (i.e., 50 years from now) and current ISDs on simulated movements of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus), a threatened species across North America. In simulations of future scenarios, we varied the spacing and permeability of ISDs and the presence/absence of protected areas. Permeability was measured as the number of times simulated caribou crossed ISDs with different levels of modelled permeability. We estimated the effects of these factors on caribou step length and annual home range size, key metrics of small and large spatiotemporal scales of movement, respectively. Current caribou crossings of above-ground pipeline features of ISDs were measured using camera traps and compared to expected caribou crossing rates based on present-day caribou movement simulations. Current crossing rates were evaluated within the context of predicted future crossing success rates necessary to maintain caribou step lengths and home ranges. With few exceptions, permeability across ISDs was the main factor affecting caribou movement, more so than spacing between developments or the presence of protected areas. However, minimal permeability (crossing rates of c. 15% to 60%, relative to an undisturbed site was needed to maintain existing home range size and step lengths. The effect of permeability on home range size and step length was non-linear, suggesting that small increases in permeability would provide a disproportionately greater benefit to caribou movement. Our predictions demonstrate that maintaining permeability across ISDs is more important than spacing between leases or including protected areas, and thus provides clear direction for mitigation efforts for features that will exist on the landscape for decades to come."

https://openalex.org/W1781585693,"Shigella spp. are among the main causative agents of acute diarrheal illness and claim more than 1 million lives per year worldwide. There are multiple bacterial genes that control the pathogenesis of Shigella, but the virF gene may be the most important. This gene, located on the primary pathogenicity island of Shigella, encodes VirF, an AraC-family transcriptional activator that is responsible for initiating the pathogenesis cycle in Shigella. We have previously shown that it is possible to attenuate the virulence of Shigella flexneri via small molecule inhibition of VirF. In this study, we probed the mechanism of action of our small molecule inhibitors of VirF. To enable these studies, we have developed a homologous and efficient expression and purification system for VirF and have optimized two different in vitro VirF-DNA binding assays. We have determined that one of our HTS hit compounds inhibits VirF binding to DNA with a calculated Ki similar to the effective doses seen in our transcriptional activation and virulence screens. This is consistent with inhibition of DNA binding as the mechanism of action of this hit compound. We have also screened 15 commercially sourced analogs of this compound and deduced an initial SAR from the approximately 100-fold range in activities. Our four other HTS hit compounds do not inhibit DNA binding and yet they do block VirF activity. This suggests that multiple agents with different molecular mechanisms of inhibition of VirF could be developed. Pursuing hits with different mechanisms of action could be a powerful approach to enhance activity and to circumvent resistance that could develop to any one of these agents."

We suggest that these two phenomena may be linked. Two studies demonstrated that students are more likely to be depressed when educational aspirations exceed expectations. In Study 1 (N = 85) aspiring to a thesis grade higher than one expected predicted greater depression at the beginning and end of the academic year. In Study 2 (N = 2820) aspiring to a level of education (e.g., attending college) higher than one expected to achieve predicted greater depression cross-sectionally and five years later. In both cases the negative effects of aspiring high while expecting low persisted even after controlling for whether or not students achieved their educational aspirations. These findings highlight the danger of teaching students to aspire higher without also investing time and money to ensure that students can reasonably expect to achieve their educational goals."
https://openalex.org/W1795527871,"Lactating sows have been shown to develop typical signs of an inflammatory condition in the liver during the transition from pregnancy to lactation. Hepatic inflammation is considered critical due to the induction of an acute phase response and the activation of stress signaling pathways like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR), both of which impair animal's health and performance. Whether ER stress-induced UPR is also activated in the liver of lactating sows and whether dietary fish oil as a source of anti-inflammatory effects n-3 PUFA is able to attenuate hepatic inflammation and ER stress-induced UPR in the liver of sows is currently unknown. Based on this, two experiments with lactating sows were performed. The first experiment revealed that ER stress-induced UPR occurs also in the liver of sows during lactation. This was evident from the up-regulation of a set of genes regulated by the UPR and numerically increased phosphorylation of the ER stress-transducer PERK and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α and IκB. The second experiment showed that fish oil inhibits ER stress-induced UPR in the liver of lactating sows. This was demonstrated by decreased mRNA levels of a number of UPR-regulated genes and reduced phosphorylation of PERK and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α and IκB in the liver of the fish oil group. The mRNA levels of various nuclear factor-κB-regulated genes encoding inflammatory mediators and acute phase proteins in the liver of lactating sows were also reduced in the fish oil group. In line with this, the plasma levels of acute phase proteins were reduced in the fish oil group, although differences to the control group were not significant. In conclusion, ER stress-induced UPR is present in the liver of lactating sows and fish oil is able to inhibit inflammatory signaling pathways and ER stress-induced UPR in the liver."

Methods and Materials The central portion of the human anterior lens capsule together with the adhering epithelial cells, approximately 5 mm in diameter, were harvested and processed within two hours after cataract surgery from high myopia-related (spherical equivalent ≥-10.00 diopters) and age-related cataract patients or from high myopia but non-cataractous patients (tissue were collected from ocular trauma patients with high myopia and lens trauma). Anterior lens samples from fresh cadaver normal human eyes were used as normal control (collected within 6 hours from death). Real-time PCR was performed to detect the mRNA levels of α-crystallins as well as unfolded protein response (UPR)-related GRP78, spliced-XBP1, ATF4 and ATF6. Western blot analysis was used to determine the protein level of α-crystallin, GRP78, p-IRE1α, p-eIF2α and ATF6. Results In the lens epithelium of the high myopia-related cataract group and the age related cataract group, the mRNA and soluble protein expression of αA- and αB-crystallin were both decreased; additionally, the protein levels of ATF6, p-eIF2α and p-IRE1α and the gene expression levels of spliced XBP1, GRP78, ATF6 and ATF4 were greatly increased relative to the normal control. Conclusion These results suggest the significant loss of soluble α-crystallin and the activation of the UPR in the lens epithelium of patients with high myopia-related cataract, which may be associated with the cataractogenesis of high myopia-related cataract."

As there are conflicting observations reported on NHE expression in human UC, the present study was initiated to identify whether NHE isoforms (NHE2 and NHE3) expression is altered and how Na+ absorption is regulated in DSS-induced inflammation in rat colon, a model that has been used to study UC. Western blot analyses indicate that neither NHE2 nor NHE3 expression is altered in apical membranes of inflamed colon. Na+ fluxes measured in vitro under voltage clamp conditions in controls demonstrate that both HCO3−-dependent and butyrate-dependent Na+ absorption are inhibited by S3226 (NHE3-inhibitor), but not by HOE694 (NHE2-inhibitor) in normal animals. In contrast, in DSS-induced inflammation, butyrate-, but not HCO3−-dependent Na+ absorption is present and is inhibited by HOE694, but not by S3226.

In in vivo loop studies HCO3−-Ringer and butyrate-Ringer exhibit similar rates of water absorption in normal rats, whereas in DSS-induced inflammation luminal butyrate-Ringer reversed water secretion observed with HCO3−-Ringer to fluid absorption. Lumen butyrate-Ringer incubation activated NHE3-mediated Na+ absorption in DSS-induced colitis. These observations suggest that the butyrate activation of NHE2 would be a potential target to control UC-associated diarrhea."
https://openalex.org/W2129761180,"Ticks are vectors for various, including pathogenic, microbes. Tick saliva contains multiple anti-host defense factors that enable ticks their bloodmeals yet also facilitate microbe transmission. Lyme disease-causing borreliae profit specifically from the broadly conserved tick histamine release factor (tHRF), and from cysteine-rich glycoproteins represented by Salp15 from Ixodes scapularis and Iric-1 from Ixodes ricinus ticks which they recruit to their outer surface protein C (OspC). Hence these tick proteins are attractive targets for anti-tick vaccines that simultaneously impair borrelia transmission. Main obstacles are the tick proteins´ immunosuppressive activities, and for Salp15 orthologs, the lack of efficient recombinant expression systems. Here, we exploited the immune-enhancing properties of hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) derived capsid-like particles (CLPs) to generate, in E. coli, nanoparticulate vaccines presenting tHRF and, as surrogates for the barely soluble wild-type proteins, cysteine-free Salp15 and Iric-1 variants. The latter CLPs were exclusively accessible in the less sterically constrained SplitCore system. Mice immunized with tHRF CLPs mounted a strong anti-tHRF antibody response. CLPs presenting cysteine-free Salp15 and Iric-1 induced antibodies to wild-type, including glycosylated, Salp15 and Iric-1. The broadly distributed epitopes included the OspC interaction sites. In vitro, the anti-Salp15 antibodies interfered with OspC binding and enhanced human complement-mediated killing of Salp15 decorated borreliae. A mixture of all three CLPs induced high titered antibodies against all three targets, suggesting the feasibility of combination vaccines. These data warrant in vivo validation of the new candidate vaccines´ protective potential against tick infestation and Borrelia transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2100071760,"T lymphocytes elicit specific responses after recognizing cognate antigen. However, antigen-experienced T cells can also respond to non-cognate stimuli, such as cytokines. CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) exhibit an antigen-experienced-like phenotype. Treg can regulate T cell responses in an antigen-specific or bystander way, and it is still unclear as to which extent they rely on T cell receptor (TCR) signals. The study of the antigen response of Treg has been hampered by the lack of downstream readouts for TCR stimuli. Here we assess the effects of TCR signals on the expression of a classical marker of early T cell activation, CD69. Although it can be induced following cytokine exposure, CD69 is commonly used as a readout for antigen response on T cells. We established that upon in vitro TCR stimulation CD69 induction on Foxp3+ Treg cells was more dependent on signaling via soluble factors than on TCR activation. By contrast, expression of the activation marker Nur77 was only induced after TCR stimulation. Our data suggest that Treg are more sensitive to TCR-independent signals than Foxp3- cells, which could contribute to their bystander activity."
https://openalex.org/W1849556428,"Small molecule inhibitors against protein geranylgeranyltransferase-I such as P61A6 have been shown to inhibit proliferation of a variety of human cancer cells and exhibit antitumor activity in mouse models. Development of these inhibitors could be dramatically accelerated by conferring tumor targeting and controlled release capability. As a first step towards this goal, we have encapsulated P61A6 into a new type of liposomes that open and release cargos only under low pH condition. These low pH-release type liposomes were prepared by adjusting the ratio of two types of phospholipid derivatives. Loading of geranylgeranyltransferase-I inhibitor (GGTI) generated liposomes with average diameter of 50-100 nm. GGTI release in solution was sharply dependent on pH values, only showing release at pH lower than 6. Release of cargos in a pH-dependent manner inside the cell was demonstrated by the use of a proton pump inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 that Increased lysosomal pH and inhibited the release of a dye carried in the pH-liposome. Delivery of GGTI to human pancreatic cancer cells was demonstrated by the inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation inside the cell and this effect was blocked by Bafilomycin A1. In addition, GGTI delivered by pH-liposomes induced proliferation inhibition, G1 cell cycle arrest that is associated with the expression of cell cycle regulator p21CIP1/WAF1. Proliferation inhibition was also observed with various lung cancer cell lines. Availability of nanoformulated GGTI opens up the possibility to combine with other types of inhibitors. To demonstrate this point, we combined the liposomal-GGTI with farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) to inhibit K-Ras signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. Our results show that the activated K-Ras signaling in these cells can be effectively inhibited and that synergistic effect of the two drugs is observed. Our results suggest a new direction in the use of GGTI for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2104532747,"The MYD88 L265P is a recurrent somatic mutation in neoplastic cells from patients with Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM). We identified the MYD88 L265P mutation in three individuals from unrelated families, but its presence did not explain the disease segregation within these WM pedigrees. We observed the mutation in these three individuals at high allele fractions in DNA extracted from EBV-immortalized Lymphoblastoid cell lines established from peripheral blood (LCL), but at much lower allele fractions in DNA extracted directly from peripheral blood, suggesting that this mutation is present in a clonal cell subpopulation rather than of germ-line origin. Furthermore, we observed that the MYD88 L265P mutation is enriched in WM families, detected in 40.5% of patients with familial WM or MGUS (10/22 WM, 5/15 MGUS), compared to 3.5% of patients with familial MM or MGUS (0/72 MM, 4/41 MGUS) (p = 10-7). The mutant allele frequency increased with passages in vitro after immortalization with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) consistent with the MYD88 L265P described gain-of-function proposed for this mutation. The MYD88 L265P mutation appears to be frequently present in circulating cells in patients with WM, and MGUS, and these cells are amenable to immortalization by EBV."

https://openalex.org/W1763419610,"People are optimistic about their prospects relative to others. However, existing studies can be difficult to interpret because outcomes are not zero-sum. For example, one person avoiding cancer does not necessitate that another person develops cancer. Ideally, optimism bias would be evaluated within a closed formal system to establish with certainty the extent of the bias and the associated environmental factors, such that optimism bias is demonstrated when a population is internally inconsistent. Accordingly, we asked NFL fans to predict how many games teams they liked and disliked would win in the 2015 season. Fans, like ESPN reporters assigned to cover a team, were overly optimistic about their team's prospects. The opposite pattern was found for teams that fans disliked. Optimism may flourish because year-to-year team results are marked by auto-correlation and regression to the group mean (i.e., good teams stay good, but bad teams improve)."
https://openalex.org/W1851916799,"The incidence of breast cancer has increased in Asian countries and rates of hormone receptor (HR) negative breast cancer exceed those of Western countries. Epidemiologic data suggest that the association between body size and BC risk may vary by HR status, and could differ geographically. While body size may influence BC risk by moderating the synthesis and metabolism of circulating sex-steroid hormones, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and related binding proteins, there is a dearth of literature among Asian women. We aimed to examine these specific associations in a sample of Chinese women. In Sichuan Province 143 women aged ≥40 years were recruited through outpatient services (2011–2012). Questionnaires, anthropometric measurements, and blood samples were utilized for data collection and linear regression was applied in data analyses. Among women <50 years we observed a non-monotonic positive association between body mass index (BMI) and 17β-estradiol, and a reversed J-shaped association between BMI and IGF-1 (p ≤0.05). We observed similar associations between waist-to-hip ratio and these markers. Our finding of augmented IGF-1 among women with low body mass may have implications for understanding breast tumor heterogeneity in diverse populations and should be evaluated in larger prospective studies with cancer outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1854208542,"Classroom-based learning is often insufficient to ensure high quality care and application of health care guidelines. Educational outreach is garnering attention as a supplemental method to enhance health care worker capacity, yet there is little information about the timing and duration required to improve facility performance. We sought to evaluate the effects of an infectious disease training program followed by either immediate or delayed on-site support (OSS), an educational outreach approach, on nine facility performance indicators for emergency triage, assessment, and treatment; malaria; and pneumonia. We also compared the effects of nine monthly OSS visits to extended OSS, with three additional visits over six months.This study was conducted at 36 health facilities in Uganda, covering 1,275,960 outpatient visits over 23 months. From April 2010 to December 2010, 36 sites received infectious disease training; 18 randomly selected sites in arm A received nine monthly OSS visits (immediate OSS) and 18 sites in arm B did not. From March 2011 to September 2011, arm A sites received three additional visits every two months (extended OSS), while the arm B sites received eight monthly OSS visits (delayed OSS). We compared the combined effect of training and delayed OSS to training followed by immediate OSS to determine the effect of delaying OSS implementation by nine months. We also compared facility performance in arm A during the extended OSS to immediate OSS to examine the effect of additional, less frequent OSS.Delayed OSS, when combined with training, was associated with significant pre/post improvements in four indicators: outpatients triaged (44% vs. 87%, aRR = 1.54, 99% CI = 1.11, 2.15); emergency and priority patients admitted, detained, or referred (16% vs. 31%, aRR = 1.74, 99% CI = 1.10, 2.75); patients with a negative malaria test result prescribed an antimalarial (53% vs. 34%, aRR = 0.67, 99% CI = 0.55, 0.82); and pneumonia suspects assessed for pneumonia (6% vs. 27%, aRR = 2.97, 99% CI = 1.44, 6.17). Differences between the delayed OSS and immediate OSS arms were not statistically significant for any of the nine indicators (all adjusted relative RR (aRRR) between 0.76-1.44, all p>0.06). Extended OSS was associated with significant improvement in two indicators (outpatients triaged: aRR = 1.09, 99% CI = 1.01; emergency and priority patients admitted, detained, or referred: aRR = 1.22, 99% CI = 1.01, 1.38) and decline in one (pneumonia suspects assessed for pneumonia: aRR: 0.93; 99% CI = 0.88, 0.98).Educational outreach held up to nine months after training had similar effects on facility performance as educational outreach started within one month post-training. Six months of bi-monthly educational outreach maintained facility performance gains, but incremental improvements were heterogeneous."
https://openalex.org/W2151380355,"We quickly form first impressions about newly encountered people guiding our subsequent behaviour (approach, avoidance). Such instant judgments might be innate and automatic, being performed unconsciously and independently to other cognitive processes. Lying detection might be subject to such a modular process. Unfortunately, numerous studies highlighted problems with lying detection paradigms such as high error rates and learning effects. Additionally, humans should be motivated doing both detecting others' lies and disguising own lies. Disguising own lies might even be more challenging than detecting other people's lies. Thus, when trying to disguise cheating behaviour, liars might display a mixture of disguising (fake) trust cues and uncontrolled lying cues making the interpretation of the expression difficult (perceivers are guessing). In two consecutive online studies, we tested whether seeing an increasing amount (range 0-4) of lying cues (LC) and non-lying cues (NLC) on a standard face results in enhanced guessing behaviour (studies 1 and 2) and that enhanced guessing is accompanied by slower responding (study 2). Results showed that pronounced guessing and slowest responding occurred for faces with an intermediate number and not with the highest number of LC and NLC. In particular, LC were more important than NLC to uncertain lying decisions. Thus, only a few LC may interfere with automatic processing of lying detection (irrespective of NLC), probably because too little lying cue information is yet available."
https://openalex.org/W1791165066,"Antibodies named TcCRA “Trypanosoma cruzi Cross Reactive Antibodies” were detected in 47% of blood donors from French population unexposed to the parasite. In order to evaluate the passive or active transmissibility of TcCRA and further characterize its role and etiology, we have conducted a study in a cohort of 47 patients who underwent allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantations (allo-HSCT). Donors and recipients were tested for TcCRA prior to transplantation. Recipients were further tested during follow-up after transplantation. Demographical, clinical and biological data were collected. Our primary end-point was to assess the risk of TcCRA acquisition after transplantation. During this initial analysis, we observed no seroconversion in patients receiving cells from TcCRA negative donors (n = 23) but detected seroconversion in 4 out of 24 patients who received hematopoietic stem cells from positive donors. Here, we are discussing possible scenarios to explain TcCRA-immune status in recipient after transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2126529633,"The belief propagation (BP) algorithm has some limitations, including ambiguous edges and textureless regions, and slow convergence speed. To address these problems, we present a novel algorithm that intrinsically improves both the accuracy and the convergence speed of BP. First, traditional BP generally consumes time due to numerous iterations. To reduce the number of iterations, inspired by the crucial importance of the initial value in nonlinear problems, a novel initial-value belief propagation (IVBP) algorithm is presented, which can greatly improve both convergence speed and accuracy. Second, .the majority of the existing research on BP concentrates on the smoothness term or other energy terms, neglecting the significance of the data term. In this study, a self-adapting dissimilarity data term (SDDT) is presented to improve the accuracy of the data term, which incorporates an additional gradient-based measure into the traditional data term, with the weight determined by the robust measure-based control function. Finally, this study explores the effective combination of local methods and global methods. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method performs well compared with the state-of-the-art BP and simultaneously holds better edge-preserving smoothing effects with fast convergence speed in the Middlebury and new 2014 Middlebury datasets."
