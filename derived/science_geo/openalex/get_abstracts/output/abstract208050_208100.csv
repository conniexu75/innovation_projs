https://openalex.org/W1985062731,"ACID phosphatase and cathepsin are two of the hydrolytic enzymes shown by de Duve1 to be present in the lysosomal fraction of liver, and similar particles have been shown in many other tissues2. Increases in lysosomal enzymes have been shown to be present in cases of rapid tissue breakdown3,4. The synovial tissue in a rheumatoid arthritic patient may proliferate rapidly, forming many villi. and can extend as the so-called pannus tissue growing over the articular cartilage. When this pannus tissue forms, erosion of the cartilage takes place. An increase in enzymes of the lysosomal type might therefore be expected in rheumatoid tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1503741124,"Observations from several laboratories in the past few years have led to the current belief that phosphorylase catalyzes glycogenolysis but not glycogenesis in the muscle cell (l-7). In resting muscle, phosphorylase has been found predominantly (60 to 70 %) in the inactive or b form (8, 9). When glycogenolysis occurs, for example, after stimulation by epinephrine (9, 10) or electrical shock (11)) the amount of active phosphoiylase, or the a form, increases at the expense of the b form. Under these conditions total phosphorylase (a plus b) does not change (9-11). A curious observation made in this laboratory (12) could not be explained by this current concept. In resting skeletal muscle of one inbred strain of mice, the I, the amount of phosphorylase a was almost negligible, 0 to 57,, but .in another strain of mice, the Cs7, the amount of phosphorylase a was 60% of the total; the total enzyme was similar in both strains (12). Although glycogenolysis is known to occur in both strains of mice, either in vitro’ or in viva (13), the amount of phosphorylase a in the skeletal muscle of the I strain has never under any conditions increased to more than 9% of the total, whereas, as shown in this report, the amount of phosphorylase a in skeletal muscle of C5, strain mice increases to as much as 90% of the total enzyme. The levels of muscle glycogen are 3to 4-fold greater in the I than in the C5, strain animals, and, superficially at least, the differences in proportion of phosphorylase a would seem to provide a reasonable explanation for this observation (12, 13). However, the means whereby glycogenolysis is achieved in I strain animals is not clear, unless one assumes that low levels of phosphorylase a are sufficient. The experiments reported here were initiated in the hope of finding conditions by which significant amounts of phosphorylase a could be demonstrated in I strain mice. No such conditions have been found in skeletal muscle. Glycogenolysis occurred in both strains of mice during exercise or after epinephrine stimulation. The amount of phosphorylase a increased in the musculature of Cr,r strain mice given epinephrine, but little or no change was found in I strain mice. In the heart, an increase in phosphorylase a could be induced in both strains of mice, with a concomitant glycogen breakdown."

https://openalex.org/W1564405046,"In studies on the metabolism of randomly labeled ( -)-nicotine-C4 in the anesthetized dog, it has been observed (2, 3) that the major part of the administered radioactivity, approximately 80 to 90$&, appears in the urine. Approximately one-tenth of this radioactivity is present as nicotine. From various experiments in which unlabeled (-)-nicotine and one of its metabolites, (-)-cotinine, have been employed (4-7), it can be deduced that another fraction, approximately one-third, is composed of derivatives of nicotine in which the pyrrolidine ring has undergone fragmentation or oxidative changes. Since N-demethylation of (-)-nicotine leads to carbon dioxide (8), and loss of 2 of the 4 carbon atoms of the pyrrolidine ring leads to 3-pyridylacetic acid (2), many of the urinary metabolites lack unique features and possess only those that are common to the metabolism of 1 and 2 carbon compounds. Indeed, radioactive urea is one of the products of the metabolism of nicotine-methyl-Cl4 in the rat (8). Our attention, therefore, has been directed to metabolites in which the pyridine ring remains intact. During the separation of urinary metabolites arising from randomly labeled ( -)-nicotine-Cl4 administered to the dog, it was observed (2) that the major portion (essentially 95%) of the radioactivity of the urine was retained on Dowex 50 (H+). An exhaustive elution with 4 M ammonia served to remove 65% of the activity from t,he column. Further quantities of radioactivity were removed (1) by elution with strong hydrochloric acid. The material so obtained had properties consistent with those of a strong base. Quaternary ammonium compounds derived from methylation of the pyridine ring of nicotine and its metabolites were at once suggested. The present report describes the isolation and identification of the methonium compounds formed by the biological methylation of the pyridine rings of (-)-nicotine and ( -)-cotinine in oivo."

This fragmentation occurs in meaningful units and is comparable to the disappearance of images stabilized on the retina. The luminous paint technique offers a new and simple approach to the study of visual perception."

https://openalex.org/W2026187936,"RESULTS of biological assays have shown Conger conger ovary1 as well as other teleost ovaries2–6 to contain œstrogenic material. No indication of the chemical structure of the steroids present in the ovaries of these fishes has so far been ascertained. Only recently œstradiol-17β has been identified in the ovarian extracts of Salmo irideus and œstradiol-17β, œstriol and 16-epi-œstriol in the ovarian extracts of Cyprinus carpio7."
https://openalex.org/W2013383394,"ELECTRON-TRANSFER reactions between organic substances have often been implicated in various biological processes1–3. Recently, Karreman, Isenberg and Szent-Györgi4 have suggested that certain central sympathetic suppressants act by donating electrons on the inside of the electric double layer of the central nervous system. A consequence of this hypothesis would be that pharmacologically active substances should possess relatively low ionization potentials."

There were no live births from these animals, whereas there were 11 live births in 57 untreated monkeys. The results are statistically significant. The hypothesis is advanced that thalidomide killed the embryo prior to implantation."

https://openalex.org/W2020202857,"THE existence of bound ascorbic acid in pork liver was reported by Sumerwell and Sealock1. Their method was, however, criticized by Lewis, Chiang and Gross2. In my search for the existence of bound ascorbic acid in different animal tissues, goat liver was studied in the present investigation. Liver was brought to the laboratory direct from the slaughter-house in a ‘Cellophane’ bag in a ‘Thermos’-flask containing ice. It was then disintegrated in a previously cooled Waring blender with cold 95 per cent ethanol saturated with carbon dioxide and centrifuged. The residue was similarly extracted twice again and all the extracts were mixed. An aliquot of this mixture was titrated with 2: 6-dichlorophenol indophenol and another aliquot was heated on a boiling water-bath for 10 min with metaphosphoric acid (5 per cent) in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide, cooled, made to a definite volume and titrated with the indophenol dye. The former would give the quantity of free ascorbic acid and the latter of total ascorbic acid. The difference in the two values would give the quantity of bound ascorbic acid, which releases ascorbic acid on hydrolysis. Total ascorbic acid was also determined for comparison by Roe and Kuether's method. Results are given in Table 1."

https://openalex.org/W2034578739,"IN a previous communication1 I reported the tendency for repetitive carbon-monoxide seizures in guinea pigs to produce ‘eosinophilic ischæmia’ relatively selectively in CA2 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, and made passing mention of amphetamine's sparing effect on the coincident ‘collapse’ of synaptic entities within the adjacent end-bulb of the mossy fibre system. Since then I have completed the neurohistological survey of 11 guinea pigs, of 400–600 g in weight, in which 10 mg amphetamine was always injected intramuscularly 0.5–4 h before exposures to carbon monoxide hypoxia and was still producing motor activation (notably in the form of compulsive gnawing) at the times of exposure. Of 5 of these animals which had 6, 5, 4, 3, and 3 full seizures, respectively, only 2 displayed ischæmia in CA2, and then only in mild degree—so that cell-soma pathology also had apparently been very appreciably spared at end-bulb levels. The remaining 6 animals, despite at least 5 exposures each, produced not even a modified seizure, and no CA2 ischæmia whatever. In 3 of these 6 it is possible that incipient coma was interrupted prematurely at every exposure; but in the other 3 the depth of pre-coma normally characterized by a full four-legged running seizure in opisthotonus was undoubtedly reached each time —so that these 3 were presumably either seizure-resistant by constitution or seizure-suppressed by the drug. (Acetazolamide, in lieu of amphetamine in a similar smaller series of experiments, tended to suppress seizures but not to diminish CA2 pathology.)"
