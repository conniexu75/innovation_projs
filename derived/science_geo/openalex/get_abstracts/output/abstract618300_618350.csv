https://openalex.org/W2890656423,"Pupil diameter and microsaccades are captured by an eye tracker and compared for their suitability as indicators of cognitive load (as beset by task difficulty). Specifically, two metrics are tested in response to task difficulty: (1) the change in pupil diameter with respect to inter- or intra-trial baseline, and (2) the rate and magnitude of microsaccades. Participants performed easy and difficult mental arithmetic tasks while fixating a central target. Inter-trial change in pupil diameter and microsaccade magnitude appear to adequately discriminate task difficulty, and hence cognitive load, if the implied causality can be assumed. This paper's contribution corroborates previous work concerning microsaccade magnitude and extends this work by directly comparing microsaccade metrics to pupillometric measures. To our knowledge this is the first study to compare the reliability and sensitivity of task-evoked pupillary and microsaccadic measures of cognitive load."

Its complete automatization would save a high quantity of resources and provide valuable improvements especially for allergy-related information systems, but also for other application fields as paleoclimate reconstruction, quality control of honey based products, collection of evidences in criminal investigations or fabric dating and tracking. This paper presents three state-of-the-art deep learning classification methods applied to the recently published POLEN23E image dataset. The three methods make use of convolutional neural networks: the first one is strictly based on the idea of transfer learning, the second one is based on feature extraction and the third one represents a hybrid approach, combining transfer learning and feature extraction. The results from the three methods are indeed very good, reaching over 97% correct classification rates in images not previously seen by the models, where other authors reported around 70."
https://openalex.org/W2910660839,"Objective Cohort studies in Europe, but not in North-America, showed an association between exposure to outdoor particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm (PM10) and lung cancer risk. Only a case-control study on lung cancer and PM10 in South Korea has so far been performed. For the first time in Europe we analyzed quantitatively this association using a case-control study design in highly polluted areas in Italy. Methods The Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study, a population-based case-control study performed in the period 2002–2005 in the Lombardy Region, north-west Italy, enrolled 2099 cases and 2120 controls frequency-matched for area of residence, gender, and age. For this study we selected subjects with complete active and passive smoking history living in the same municipality since 1980 until study enrollment. Fine resolution annual PM10 estimates obtained by applying land use regression modeling to satellite data calibrated with fixed site monitor measurements were used. We assigned each subject the PM10 average estimates for year 2000 based on enrollment address. We used logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for matching variables, education, smoking, and dietary and occupational variables. Results We included 3473 subjects, 1665 cases (1318 men, 347 women) and 1808 controls (1368 men, 440 women), with PM10 individual levels ranging from 2.3 to 53.8 μg/m3 (mean: 46.3). We found increasing lung cancer risk with increasing PM10 category (P-value for trend: 0.04). The OR per 10 μg/m3 was 1.28 (95% CI: 0.95–1.72). The association appeared stronger for squamous cell carcinoma (OR 1.44, 95% CI: 0.90–2.29). Conclusion In a population living in highly polluted areas in Italy, our study added suggestive evidence of a positive association between PM10 exposure and lung cancer risk. This study emphasizes the need to strengthen policies to reduce airborne pollution."
https://openalex.org/W2892026688,"Recent research suggests that cognitive performance might be altered by the respiratory-synchronized activity generated in the brain. Previous human studies, however, have yielded inconsistent results when assessing task performance during distinct respiratory phases (inspiratory phase vs. expiratory phase). We therefore tested whether cognitive performance was regulated based on the timing of breathing components (e.g., expiratory-to-inspiratory (EI) phase transition) during the retrieval process. To determine the role of respiration in performance, the present study employed healthy subjects (n = 18) in a delayed matching-to-sample visual recognition task where a test cue was given in the respiratory phase-locked (Phased) or regularly paced (Non-phased) presentation paradigm. During the Phased session but not during the Non-phased session, the response time (RT) of the task increased by 466 ms (p = 0.003), and accuracy decreased by 21.4% (p = 0.004) when the retrieval process encompassed the EI transition. Breathing-dependent changes were particularly prominent when the EI transition occurred during the middle step of the retrieval process. Meanwhile, changes in the RT and accuracy were not observed when the retrieval process encompassed the inspiratory-to-expiratory phase transition. This is the first time that a certain phase transition in the respiratory cycle has been shown to modulate performance on a time scale of several seconds in a cognitive task. We propose that attenuation of these breathing-dependent cognitive fluctuations might be crucial for the maintenance and stability of successful performance in daily life and sports."
https://openalex.org/W2891667249,"Infanticide occurs in a variety of animal species and infanticide risk has large implications for the evolution of behavior. Further, the sex hypothesis of sexual segregation predicts that for species in which infanticide occurs, females with dependent young will avoid males to reduce risk of sexually-selected infanticide. Infanticide risk-avoidance behavior has been studied primarily in social species, but also occurs in some solitary species. We used generalized linear mixed models to determine if space use and movements of female American black bears (Ursus americanus) during the breeding season were consistent with the sex hypothesis of sexual segregation in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA. Space use and movements of female black bears (n = 16) were not consistent with avoidance behavior to reduce sexually-selected infanticide risk. Females with cubs occupied core areas (mean = 4.64 km2, standard error [SE] = 1.28) and home ranges (mean = 19.46 km2, SE = 5.10) of similar size to females without cubs (core area [mean = 4.11 km2, SE = 0.59]; home range [mean = 16.07 km2, SE = 2.26]), and those core areas and home ranges were not in areas with lesser relative probability of male use. Additionally, females with cubs did not reduce movements during times of day when male movements were greatest. As female bears do avoid potentially infanticidal males in populations with greater levels of infanticide, female black bears may exhibit variation in avoidance behavior based on the occurrence of infanticide."
https://openalex.org/W2891398148,"Objective Establishing normal liver stiffness (LS) values in healthy livers is a prerequisite to differentiate normal from pathological LS values. Our aim was to define normal LS using two novel elastography methods head-to-head and to assess the number of measurements, variability and reproducibility. Materials and methods We evaluated shear wave elastography (SWE) methods integrated in Samsung RS80A and GE S8 by obtaining LS measurements (LSM) in 100 healthy subjects (20–70 years). Transient Elastography (TE) was used as reference method. Data were analyzed according to age, sex, BMI and 5 vs. 10 measurements. All subjects underwent B-mode ultrasound examination and lab tests to exclude liver pathology. Interobserver variation was evaluated in a subset (n = 24). Results Both methods showed excellent feasibility, measuring LS in all subjects. LSM-mean for GE S8 2D-SWE was higher compared to TE (4.5±0.8 kPa vs. 4.2±1.1, p<0.001) and Samsung RS80A (4.1±0.8 kPa, p<0.001). Both methods showed low intra- and interobserver variation. LSM-mean was significantly higher in males than females using 2D-SWE, while a similar trend for Samsung SWE did not reach significance. No method demonstrated statistical significant difference in LSM across age and BMI groups nor between LSM-mean based on 5 vs. 10 measurements. Conclusion LSM was performed with high reproducibility in healthy adult livers. LSM-mean was significantly higher for GE S8 2D-SWE compared to Samsung RS80A and TE in healthy livers. Males had higher LSM than females. No method demonstrated statistical significant difference in LSM-mean across age- and non-obese BMI groups. Our results indicate that five LSM may be sufficient for reliable results."
https://openalex.org/W2891782674,"Sactipeptides are a subclass of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). They contain a unique thioether bond, referred to as a sactionine linkage, between the sulfur atom of a cysteine residue and the α-carbon of an acceptor residue. These linkages are formed via radical chemistry and are essential for the spermicidal, antifungal, and antibacterial properties of sactipeptides. Enzymes that form these linkages, called sactisynthases, are AdoMet radical enzymes in the SPASM/Twitch subgroup whose structures are incompletely characterized. Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure to 1.29-Å resolution and Mössbauer analysis of SkfB, a sactisynthase from Bacillus subtilis involved in making sporulation killing factor (SKF). We found that SkfB is a modular enzyme with an N-terminal peptide-binding domain comprising a RiPP recognition element (RRE), a middle domain that forms a classic AdoMet radical partial (β/α)6 barrel structure and displays AdoMet bound to the [4Fe-4S] cluster, and a C-terminal region characteristic of the so-called Twitch domain housing an auxiliary iron-sulfur cluster. Notably, both crystallography and Mössbauer analyses suggest that SkfB can bind a [2Fe-2S] cluster at the auxiliary cluster site, which has been observed only once before in a SPASM/Twitch auxiliary cluster site in the structure of another AdoMet radical enzyme, the pyrroloquinoline quinone biosynthesis enzyme PqqE.

These sactisynthases are members of the S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) radical enzyme superfamily, which utilize a canonical CX3CXφC motif (where φ is a conserved aromatic amino acid) to coordinate a [4Fe-4S] cluster, thereby named the AdoMet radical cluster (12Sofia H.J.

AdoMet binds to the site-differentiated iron of the AdoMet radical cluster and is reductively cleaved to produce a highly reactive 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (5′-dAdo•) species. 5′-dAdo• subsequently abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate, forming 5′-deoxyadenosine and a substrate radical, which undergoes further transformation to form the desired product.

RREs are expected to bind the leader sequences of the peptide substrates to secure the substrate to the enzyme, whereas the SPASM or Twitch domains are expected to coordinate additional or auxiliary iron-sulfur clusters (Aux I and Aux II), whose function in sactipeptide generation is not fully established. SPASM and Twitch domains are not unique to sactisynthases. They are found in several thousand AdoMet radical enzymes that display activities ranging from the dehydrogenation reaction catalyzed by butirosin biosynthetic enzyme BtrN to the amino acid cross-linking reaction catalyzed by the streptide-like biosynthetic enzyme SuiB (Fig. S1). SPASM domains are characterized by the presence of a conserved seven-cysteine motif (CX9–15GX4CgapCX2CX5CX3CgapC) that is used to coordinate two iron-sulfur clusters, Aux I and Aux II (17Grell T.A.

Here, we present the first view of the sactisynthase SkfB, a Twitch domain–containing family member. SkfB initiates thioether cross-link formation between the α-carbon of Met12 of the precursor peptide SkfA (Fig. 1B) during the maturation of the sactipeptide sporulation killing factor in Bacillus subtilis (1Flühe L.

Although the role of the Aux cluster in SkfB is unknown, it is required for overall activity (7Flühe L. Burghaus O. Wieckowski B.M. Giessen T.W. Linne U.

Bruender N.A. Bandarian V. A radical clock probe uncouples H-atom abstraction from thioether crosslink formation by the radical SAM enzyme SkfB.Biochemistry. 2018; 57 (29965747): 4816-482310.1021/acs.biochem.8b00537Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The cyclopropylglycine-containing substrate does not undergo thioether cross-link formation. These studies suggest that in SkfB, Aux I does not play any role in the initial H-atom transfer events, but rather in the late stages of the functionalization of the peptide. To further probe the role and nature of Aux I in SkfB, here we investigated SkfB both by crystallography and spectroscopy. The structure of SkfB from B. subtilis in complex with AdoMet was solved to 1.29-Å resolution using an iron single-wavelength anomalous dispersion technique (Table 1). The final structure contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit with residues 12–322 and 330–401, a molecule of AdoMet bound to a [4Fe-4S] AdoMet radical cluster, and a [2Fe-2S] auxiliary cluster. The SkfB architecture is modular, folding into three distinct domains: an N-terminal peptide-binding domain, an AdoMet radical domain, and a C-terminal Twitch domain (Fig. 2).Table 1Data collection and refinement statistics for SkfB structureSkfBIron peakaBijvoet pairs were scaled separately in this data set.RemoteData collectionBeamlineHome SourceAPS 24-ID-CWavelength (Å)1.54180.9792Space groupC2C2Cell dimensions (Å)76.5, 83.1, 61.376.5, 83.1, 61.3Resolution (Å)50.0–1.97 (2.00–1.97)50.0–1.29 (1.34–1.29)Unique reflections52,21692,230Completeness97.8 (69.0)96.5 (76.2)Redundancy3.6 (2.4)5.6 (2.6)RsymbRsym = ΣhklΣi |Iihkl − 〈Ihkl{|/ΣhklΣiIihkl.0.043 (0.119)0.037 (0.499)I/σ(I)29.5 (7.7)43.6 (1.8)CC1/2dCC1/2 is Pearson's correlation coefficient.(0.729)Model refinementResolution limits (Å)50.0–1.29Rwork/RfreecR-factor = Σ(|Fobs| − k|Fcalc|)/Σ(|Fobs|) and Rfree of the R value for a test set of reflections consisting of 7.5% of the diffraction data not used in refinement.14.25/16.85No. molecules in asu1No. atomsProtein3,226[Fe-S]12AdoMet27Water390B-factors (Å2)Protein20.2[Fe-S]15.8AdoMet13.74Water30.7r.m.s. deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.006Bond Angles (°)0.927Rotamer outliers (%)0.87Ramachandran plot (%)Most favored98.15Additionally allowed1.85Disallowed0.0a Bijvoet pairs were scaled separately in this data set.b Rsym = ΣhklΣi |Iihkl − 〈Ihkl{|/ΣhklΣiIihkl.c R-factor = Σ(|Fobs| − k|Fcalc|)/Σ(|Fobs|) and Rfree of the R value for a test set of reflections consisting of 7.5% of the diffraction data not used in refinement.d CC1/2 is Pearson's correlation coefficient. Open table in a new tab The central domain of SkfB (residues 106–322) folds into a partial (β/α)6 TIM barrel with six parallel β-strands comprising the inner face of the barrel and six α-helices flanking the outside of the barrel, providing flexibility to the rigid barrel architecture (Fig. 2, A–C). This architecture is characteristic of AdoMet radical enzymes and provides a binding site for cofactors and substrates in a protected cavity that facilitates the corresponding radical mechanisms of members of the superfamily. Herein, we will refer to the partial (β/α)6 TIM barrel architecture as the AdoMet radical domain. Residues from the canonical CX3CXφC motif, Cys117, Cys121, and Cys124, are located on the loop following β1 and ligate an essential [4Fe-4S] cluster, the AdoMet radical cluster, leaving a unique iron for direct coordination of AdoMet (Figs. 2, A–C, and 3A). In the structure of SkfB, the α-amino and α-carboxyl groups of AdoMet are found 2.3 and 2.2 Å, respectively, from the site-differentiated iron of the AdoMet radical cluster. Conserved interactions from the AdoMet radical domain help position AdoMet in a catalytically competent orientation in the active site with all known motifs represented (Fig. 4) (22Dowling D.P. Vey J.L. Croft A.K. Drennan C.L. Structural diversity in the AdoMet radical enzyme superfamily.Biochim. Biophys.

In particular, hydrogen bonds from the conserved GGE motif, Gly160, Gly161, and Glu162, and Arg223 orient the α-amino and α-carboxyl moieties of AdoMet. The ribose motif, Ser211, and residue Arg223, located adjacent to helix α4a, serve to position the hydroxyls of the ribose ring in the active site. The adenine moiety of AdoMet is oriented in the active site through hydrophobic interactions from Thr251 of the “GXIXGXXE” (or β5 motif) and from Phe123 of the CX3CXφC motif. Polar backbone interactions from the β6 motif, Leu258, and from the hydrophobic residues of the CX3CXφC motif, Phe123 and Tyr125 (Fig. 4), further help to orient AdoMet in the active site. Following helix α6, the SkfB structure wraps back to the N terminus of the AdoMet radical domain and places β1′ of the C-terminal domain adjacent to β1, extending the inner parallel β-sheet by one strand (Fig. 2B). The majority of the linker between the AdoMet radical domain and the C-terminal domain (residues 322–329) is disordered in SkfB. Following the first visible residue of the C-terminal region (Thr330), the structure folds into a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, β1′–β3′, followed by two α-helices, a short α1′ and a longer α2′ (Fig. 2, A, B, and D). This C-terminal domain ligates Aux I, which in this structure is a [2Fe-2S] cluster (Fig. 3B). Cluster ligation involves one cysteine from the loop following β2′, Cys351, and two cysteines from the loop following α2′, Cys385 and Cys387 (Fig. 2B). This architecture is as expected for a Twitch domain (Fig. 5, A–D) (17Grell T.A. Goldman P.J. Drennan C.L. SPASM and twitch domains in S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) radical enzymes.J. Biol.

Both SkfB and PqqE utilize a CXC sequence, Cys385 and Cys387 and Cys323 and Cys325, respectively, following helix α2 to ligate the visualized [2Fe-2S] cluster where each cysteine coordinates a different iron of the cluster. A CXC cluster-binding sequence has not been seen in the other SPASM/Twitch enzymes structurally characterized (Figs. 5, H and I, and 6). When the Aux I sites of SkfB and PqqE are overlaid with a [4Fe-4S]-containing Twitch and SPASM enzyme, respectively, the observed [2Fe-2S] cluster superimposes well with Aux I [4Fe-4S] clusters (Fig. 6), and that a [4Fe-4S] cluster should be able to be accommodated at this site as well (Fig. 6). In terms of cluster ligation, the SPASM enzymes anSME, SuiB, and PqqE and the Twitch enzyme BtrN have fully ligated auxiliary clusters (Fig. 5), whereas the Twitch enzyme MoaA and the SPASM enzyme CteB have an open coordination site on Aux I.

Detection of CPE from blood cultures (BC) by standard methods takes 16–72 hours, which can delay the initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and compromise patient outcome. In the present study, we developed and evaluated a new method for the rapid detection of carbapenemases directly from positive BC using a new multiplex immunochromatographic test (ICT). The new ICT was assessed using 170 molecularly characterized Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates including 126 CPE (OXA-48-like (N = 79), KPC (N = 18) and NDM (N = 29)). After spiking with bacteria and incubation in a BC system, blood from positive BC bottles was hemolyzed, bacteria concentrated by centrifugation and lysed. The lysate was transferred to the RESIST-3 O.K.N. ICT (Coris BioConcept, Gembloux, Belgium), which detects OXA-48-like, KPC and NDM carbapenemases. The final results of the ICT were read when they became positive, at the latest after 15 min. All CPE isolates (126/126) were correctly detected with the new protocol (100% sensitivity, 100% specificity). There was perfect concordance between ICT results and molecular characterization. Total time to result was 20–45 min. Conclusions: This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that with the newly developed method, OXA-48-like, KPC and NDM carbapenemases can be reliably detected directly from positive BC bottles. The new method is more rapid than other currently available assays and can be performed in any routine microbiology laboratory. This can help to rapidly identify patients with CPE BSI and optimize the management of patients with these difficult-to-treat infections. Further studies are needed to assess the performance of the ICT in routine diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2890969849,"Prostate cancer (PCA) is one of the most common cancer types in men, with cancer progression being linked to hypoxia and the induction of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF).We investigated the expression of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), its regulation by HIF isoforms 1α and 2α, and its role in HIF stabilization. We additionally examined cell survival in the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and LNCaP under severe hypoxic (0.1% O2) and normoxic (20% O2) conditions. qRT-PCR showed higher up-regulation of PKM2 mRNA expression in LNCaP cells than in PC3 cells, while western blotting showed that PKM2 protein levels were up-regulated only in LNCaP cells. Inhibition of HIF-1α and HIF-2α by small interfering RNA (si-RNA) demonstrated HIF-1α dependent up-regulation of PKM2 at the mRNA and protein levels in LNCaP cells. PKM2 inhibition by si-RNA significantly decreased hypoxia-response element (HRE) activation in a gene reporter assay and down-regulated HIF-1α target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression in PC3 cells, whereas HIF-1α protein levels were not significantly reduced. Additionally, PKM2 inhibition significantly reduced clonogenic survival in both cell lines in a colony formation assay. Prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) mRNA expression was up-regulated in both cell lines. It has been shown that PKM2 expression is regulated by HIF-1α and that PKM2 favors HIF-1α transactivation under mild (1% O2) but not severe (0.1% O2) hypoxic conditions, and some of our findings are consistent with these previous results. However, this mechanism was not fully observed in our studied cell lines, as PKM2 regulation and HIF-1α stabilization at the transactivation level occurred under severe hypoxic conditions. This discrepancy suggests that tumor tissue origin and cell type influence this model. Our findings expand the current knowledge of the mechanisms of PCA regulation, and would be important in developing novel therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2890429857,"Although substantial attention has focused on efforts by the new Administration to block environmental policies, climate politics have been contentious in the US since well before the election of Donald Trump. In this paper, we extend previous work on empirical examinations of echo chambers in US climate politics using new data collected on the federal climate policy network in summer 2016. We test for the similarity and differences at two points in time in homophily and echo chambers using Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) to compare new findings from 2016 to previous work on data from 2010. We show that echo chambers continue to play a significant role in the network of information exchange among policy elites working on the issue of climate change. In contrast to previous findings where echo chambers centered on a binding international commitment to emission reductions, we find that the pre-existing echo chambers have almost completely disappeared and new structures have formed around one of the main components of the Obama Administration’s national climate policy: the Clean Power Plan. These results provide empirical evidence that science communication and policymaking at the elite level shift in relation to the policy instruments under consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2892170356,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is an opportunistic Gram-positive pathogen that can cause invasive disease. Recent studies have shown that S. pneumoniae is able to invade the myocardium and kill cardiomyocytes, with one-in-five adults hospitalized for pneumococcal pneumonia having a pneumonia-associated adverse cardiac event. Furthermore, clinical reports have shown up to a 10-year increased risk of adverse cardiac events in patients formerly hospitalized for pneumococcal bacteremia. In this study, we investigated the ability of nine S. pneumoniae clinical isolates, representing eight unique serotypes, to cause cardiac damage in a mouse model of invasive disease. Following intraperitoneal challenge of C57BL/6 mice, four of these strains (D39, WU2, TIGR4, and 6A-10) caused high-grade bacteremia, while CDC7F:2617–97 and AMQ16 caused mid- and low-grade bacteremia, respectively. Three strains did not cause any discernible disease. Of note, only the strains capable of high-grade bacteremia caused cardiac damage, as inferred by serum levels of cardiac troponin-I. This link between bacteremia and heart damage was further corroborated by Hematoxylin & Eosin and Trichrome staining which showed cardiac cytotoxicity only in D39, WU2, TIGR4, and 6A-10 infected mice. Finally, hearts infected with these strains showed varying histopathological characteristics, such as differential lesion formation and myocytolysis, suggesting that the mechanism of heart damage varied between strains."

Currently the efficacy of available live attenuated or killed vaccines against IBV has been challenged. We designed a novel IBV vaccine alternative using a highly innovative platform called Self-Assembling Protein Nanoparticle (SAPN). In this vaccine, B cell epitopes derived from the second heptad repeat (HR2) region of IBV spike proteins were repetitively presented in its native trimeric conformation. In addition, flagellin was co-displayed in the SAPN to achieve a self-adjuvanted effect. Three groups of chickens were immunized at four weeks of age with the vaccine prototype, IBV-Flagellin-SAPN, a negative-control construct Flagellin-SAPN or a buffer control. The immunized chickens were challenged with 5x104.7 EID50 IBV M41 strain. High antibody responses were detected in chickens immunized with IBV-Flagellin-SAPN. In ex vivo proliferation tests, peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from IBV-Flagellin-SAPN immunized chickens had a significantly higher stimulation index than that of PBMCs from chickens receiving Flagellin-SAPN. Chickens immunized with IBV-Flagellin-SAPN had a significant reduction of tracheal virus shedding and lesser tracheal lesion scores than did negative control chickens.

https://openalex.org/W2891561885,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) activity at the plasma membrane is tightly controlled by the availability of co-receptors and competing receptor isoforms. We have previously shown that FGFR1 activity in pancreatic beta-cells modulates a wide range of processes, including lipid metabolism, insulin processing, and cell survival. More recently, we have revealed that co-expression of FGFR5, a receptor isoform that lacks a tyrosine-kinase domain, influences FGFR1 responses. We therefore hypothesized that FGFR5 is a co-receptor to FGFR1 that modulates responses to ligands by forming a receptor heterocomplex with FGFR1. We first show here increased FGFR5 expression in the pancreatic islets of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and also in mouse and human islets treated with proinflammatory cytokines. Using siRNA knockdown, we further report that FGFR5 and FGFR1 expression improves beta-cell survival. Co-immunoprecipitation and quantitative live-cell imaging to measure the molecular interaction between FGFR5 and FGFR1 revealed that FGFR5 forms a mixture of ligand-independent homodimers (∼25%) and homotrimers (∼75%) at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, co-expressed FGFR5 and FGFR1 formed heterocomplexes with a 2:1 ratio and subsequently responded to FGF2 by forming FGFR5/FGFR1 signaling complexes with a 4:2 ratio. Taken together, our findings identify FGFR5 as a co-receptor that is up-regulated by inflammation and promotes FGFR1-induced survival, insights that reveal a potential target for intervention during beta-cell pathogenesis."

However, the molecular mechanisms by which estrogens modulate metabolism across tissues remain ill-defined.

The liver is another key tissue for glucose homeostasis and a target of E2 therapy. Thus, in the present study we determined the effects of acute loss of ovarian E2 and E2 administration on liver mitochondria. In contrast to skeletal muscle mitochondria, E2 depletion via OVX did not alter liver mitochondrial respiratory function or complex I (CI) specific activities (NADH oxidation, quinone reduction, and H2O2 production). Surprisingly, in vivo E2 replacement therapy and in vitro E2 exposure induced tissue-specific effects on both CI activity and on the rate and topology of CI H2O2 production. Overall, E2 therapy protected and restored the OVX-induced reduction in CI activity in skeletal muscle, whereas in liver mitochondria E2 increased CI H2O2 production and decreased ADP-stimulated respiratory capacity.

In skeletal muscle, E2 localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it lowers membrane viscosity, which, in turn, promotes bioenergetic function, cellular redox balance, and insulin sensitivity (17Torres M.J.

Many of the beneficial effects of E2 appear to be mediated through improved complex I (CI) activity, which is curious given that exposure of liver mitochondria to E2 reportedly inhibits CI activity (18Moreira P.I.

Combined, these findings raise the possibility that the effects of E2 on mitochondrial function may be tissue-specific (19Moreira P.I. Custódio J.B. Nunes E. Oliveira P.J. Moreno A. Seiça R.

Taken together, these data suggest that the effects of E2 may not only be tissue-specific but also dependent on the pathophysiology of the tissue. In the present study, ex vivo and in vitro experiments were performed to assess and compare the targeted effects of E2 loss and E2 replacement on the kinetics and H2O2-emitting potential of CI in mitochondria from both liver and skeletal muscle. Overall, the findings suggest that E2 treatment is beneficial in restoring CI kinetics in skeletal muscle after ovarian E2 depletion. In contrast, liver mitochondrial function is minimally impacted by E2 depletion, whereas E2 treatment unexpectedly increases CI-mediated H2O2 production and decreases OXPHOS capacity. Young, sexually mature (10-week-old) female mice were studied 2 weeks after OVX (OVX-2w) and after an additional 2 weeks ± E2 treatment (OVX-4w(E2) and OVX-4w(ctl), respectively). Loss of circulating ovarian E2 was confirmed by reduced uterine weights relative to normally cycling females in the proestrus stage (NC-Pro) of the estrus cycle as previously described (17Torres M.J.

In contrast with skeletal muscle (17Torres M.J. Kew K.A. Ryan T.E. Pennington E.R. Lin C.T. Buddo K.A. Fix A.M. Smith C.A. Gilliam L.A. Karvinen S. Lowe D.A. Spangenburg E.E. Zeczycki T.N.

GSH reductase activity was increased in OVX mice treated with E2 (Fig. 1F), consistent with an E2-induced up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes in the liver (29Abbas A.M. Elsamanoudy A.Z. Effects of 17β-estradiol and antioxidant administration on oxidative stress and insulin resistance in ovariectomized rats.Can J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2011; 89 (21812527): 497-50410.1139/y11-053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). OVX ± E2 therapy did not alter mitochondrial content in liver, as demonstrated by unchanged citrate synthase activity and expression levels of the respiratory complexes (Fig. 2, A and B). We recently found that loss of E2 from OVX decreases mitochondrial CI, CIII, CI+III, and CII+III activity in skeletal muscle (17Torres M.J. Kew K.A. Ryan T.E. Pennington E.R. Lin C.T. Buddo K.A.

In sharp contrast, the specific activities of CI, CIII, and CIV, as well as electron transfer between CI and CIII and between CII and CIII, were not affected in liver mitochondria after ovarian E2 withdrawal (Fig. 2C). Also in contrast to muscle (17Torres M.J. Kew K.A. Ryan T.E. Pennington E.R. Lin C.T. Buddo K.A. Fix A.M. Smith C.A. Gilliam L.A. Karvinen S. Lowe D.A. Spangenburg E.E. Zeczycki T.N. Shaikh S.R.

Although E2 treatment increased the individual specific activities of CI and CIII by ∼40% (p < 0.05) and ∼48% (p < 0.005), respectively, the accompanying CI to CIII activity remained the same. To further evaluate the potential tissue-specific effects of E2 on CI kinetics and JH2O2 production, the steady-state rates of NADH oxidation, decylubiquinone (DCU, a soluble substrate analog of coenzyme Q) reduction and H2O2 production were measured in fractured liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria from NC-Pro and OVX mice ± E2 treatment (Fig. 3). The NADH (IF) and quinone (IQ) binding sites are separated by a ∼90 Å tunnel containing eight redox-sensitive iron–sulfur clusters that connect the primary electron acceptor FMN to the quinone-binding site (30Wirth C. Brandt U. Hunte C. Zickermann V. Structure and function of mitochondrial complex I.Biochim. Biophys.

Overall, the maximal rate of CI-mediated NADH oxidation in NC-Pro control mice was ∼2-fold higher in liver compared with skeletal muscle mitochondria (Fig. 3, A versus D), whereas the maximal rate of quinone reduction was comparable between tissues (Fig. 3, B and E). Maximal rates of H2O2 production by CI were also higher in liver versus muscle mitochondria (Fig. 3, C versus F). CI activity responded differently to ovarian E2 depletion and E2 therapy in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria. In liver, E2 depletion via OVX did not affect either the maximal rate of CI NADH oxidation or quinone reduction (Fig. 3, A–C). However, E2 treatment increased the maximal rate of NADH oxidation in OVX compared with NC-Pro control mice (Fig. 3A), whereas the maximal rate of quinone reduction remained unchanged (Fig. 3B). In skeletal muscle, the maximal rate of NADH oxidation was reduced in mitochondria isolated from OVX mice but was restored to NC-Pro levels with E2 treatment (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the maximal rate of quinone reduction remained unchanged after OVX but was significantly increased with E2 treatment (Fig. 3E). Finally, in liver mitochondria CI JH2O2 production was not affected after either 2- or 4-week OVX but was surprisingly increased by 2-fold after E2 treatment (Fig. 3C). Consistent with prior findings (17Torres M.J. Kew K.A. Ryan T.E. Pennington E.R. Lin C.T. Buddo K.A. Fix A.M. Smith C.A. Gilliam L.A. Karvinen S. Lowe D.A. Spangenburg E.E. Zeczycki T.N. Shaikh S.R.

IF and IQ are the two major sites of superoxide/H2O2 production in CI (32Brand M.D. Mitochondrial generation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide as the source of mitochondrial redox signaling.Free Radic.

In light of the tissue-specific response of CI activity, we next evaluated the influence of E2 on superoxide/H2O2 production at sites IF and IQ of CI in each tissue. Freshly isolated liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria from NC-Pro and OVX-2w mice were exposed to a low (1 nm) or high (30 nm) concentration of E2 in vitro, and JH2O2 production was determined at each of the respective CI sites. Inhibitors to the mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes thioredoxin reductase and GSH reductase were included to permit direct detection of JH2O2 production (33Fisher-Wellman K.H. Lin C.T. Ryan T.E.

J. 2015; 467 (25643703): 271-28010.1042/BJ20141447Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The maximal JH2O2 production at site IF was measured using malate as substrate in the presence of rotenone (32Brand M.D. Mitochondrial generation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide as the source of mitochondrial redox signaling.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2016; 100 (27085844): 14-3110.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2016.04.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). ATP and aspartate were included to prevent H2O2 generation from 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, a potential site of electron leak when malate is the only substrate (32Brand M.D. Mitochondrial generation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide as the source of mitochondrial redox signaling.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2016; 100 (27085844): 14-3110.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2016.04.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). For the IQ site, we determined the maximal succinate-supported JH2O2 production sensitive to N-cyclohexyl-4-(4-nitrophenoxy)-benzenesulfonamide, which inhibits electron leak at IQ without affecting oxidative phosphorylation (34Orr A.L. Ashok D. Sarantos M.R. Shi T. Hughes R.E. Brand M.D. Inhibitors of ROS production by the ubiquinone-binding site of mitochondrial complex I identified by chemical screening.Free Radic. Biol.

Yadava N. Bunik V.I. Brand M.D. The 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes in mitochondria can produce superoxide/hydrogen peroxide at much higher rates than complex I.J. Biol.

Interestingly, despite differences in the catalytic rates of NADH oxidation and DCU reduction at sites IF and IQ, respectively (Fig. 3), maximal JH2O2 production was similar between the two tissues (Fig. 4, B versus D and C versus E). In liver mitochondria, OVX did not affect maximal JH2O2 production at either site IF or IQ (Fig. 4, B and C). Preincubation (15 min) of liver mitochondria from OVX mice with either low or high concentrations of E2 tended to increase maximal JH2O2 production at site IQ only (Fig. 4C). By contrast, in mitochondria from skeletal muscle, maximal JH2O2 production at site IF was ∼2-fold higher in OVX relative to NC-Pro mice (p < 0.05) but was restored by preincubation with E2 (Fig. 4D). Similarly, maximal JH2O2 production at site IQ was slightly elevated after OVX and restored by preincubation with E2 (Fig. 4E). Overall, these results suggest that loss of ovarian E2 in vivo and E2 replacement in vitro (at nanomolar concentrations as in Ref. 17Torres M.J. Kew K.A. Ryan T.E. Pennington E.R. Lin C.T. Buddo K.A.

To test whether in vitro treatment with E2 affects mitochondrial respiration supported by CI-linked substrates (glutamate/malate), oxygen consumption rates (JO2) were determined in liver and muscle mitochondria from NC-Pro and OVX-2w mice exposed (15 min) to increasing concentrations of E2. In control mice prior to addition of E2, maximal ADP-stimulated CI-supported JO2 was ∼14-fold lower in liver versus skeletal muscle mitochondria (Fig. 5, A and B). Addition of the CII-linked substrate succinate to liver mitochondria generated a higher maximal ADP-stimulated JO2 response, but this was still well below the respiratory capacity of skeletal muscle mitochondria. OVX-induced loss of E2 decreased maximal CI-supported JO2 in skeletal muscle, but not liver mitochondria. We previously found that acute in vitro incubation of skeletal muscle mitochondria from OVX mice with nanomolar concentrations of E2 replenishes membrane E2 content but fails to restore maximal JO2 (17Torres M.J. Kew K.A. Ryan T.E. Pennington E.R. Lin C.T. Buddo K.A. Fix A.M. Smith C.A. Gilliam L.A. Karvinen S. Lowe D.A. Spangenburg E.E. Zeczycki T.N. Shaikh S.R.

In the present study, acute in vitro exposure to low nanomolar concentrations of E2 did not increase CI-supported JO2 in skeletal muscle mitochondria from OVX mice (Fig. 5B), consistent with the notion that restoration of mitochondrial respiratory capacity by in vivo E2 therapy may involve genomic mechanisms. Interestingly in liver, exposure to low nanomolar concentrations of E2 induced an inhibitory effect on maximal ADP-stimulated JO2 (Fig. 5A). Incubation with higher, supraphysiological E2 concentrations (30 μm) inhibited CI-linked JO2 by 35–50% in mitochondria from both liver and skeletal muscle of NC-Pro and OVX mice, possibly reflecting inhibition of the FMN cofactor in CI (18Moreira P.I.

https://openalex.org/W2892255938,"Helicoverpa armigera is an universal pest around the world, which has recovered again in recent years because of the adjustment of cropping structure and resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) in China. As a new insecticide spinetoram is extensively used to control many pest insects, including H. armigera. However the lethal and sublethal effects of spinetoram on cotton bollworm have not been assessed. In the present study, the toxicity of spinetoram against cotton bollworm was tested under laboratory conditions. Results demonstrated spinetoram showed an excellent activity against H. armigera, especially, against Bt (Cry1Ac) resistant H. armigera. Treatment with spinetoram at the doses of 0.19 mg/kg and 0.36 mg/kg (LC8 and LC20 after 24h oral exposure) significantly arrested the development of surviving larvae and caused significant decrease in larvae wet weight. Besides, the survivors after spinetoram treatments showed significant reduction of pupation ratio, pupal weight, emergence ratio, longevity and fecundity of adults. At same time, spinetoram treatments resulted in significant increase in the prepupal and pupal periods of survivors. In summary, these results showed that spinetoram could be used as an effective pesticide to control H. armigera, especially Cry1Ac-ressitacne, consequently to take both lethal and sublethal effects to cotton bollworm into consideration in cotton bollworm control strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2892078692,"Microsoft Kinect sensors are considered to be low-cost popular RGB-D sensors and are widely employed in various applications. Consequently, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the reliability and validity of Microsoft Kinect sensors, and noise models have been proposed for the sensors. Several studies utilized motion capture systems as a golden standard to assess the Microsoft Kinect sensors, and none of them reported interference between Kinect sensors and motion capture systems. This study aimed to investigate possible interference between a golden standard (i.e., Qualisys) and Microsoft Kinect v2. The depth recordings of Microsoft Kinect sensors were processed to estimate the intensity of interference. A flat non-reflective surface was utilized, and smoothness of the surface was measured using Microsoft Kinect v2 in absence and presence of an active motion capture system. The recording was repeated in five different distances. The results indicated that Microsoft Kinect v2 is distorted by the motion capture system and the distortion is increasing by increasing distance between Kinect and region of interest. Regarding the results, it can be concluded that the golden standard motion capture system is robust against interference from the Microsoft Kinect sensors."
https://openalex.org/W2892229617,"Brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1 (BMAL-1) is an important component of the cellular circadian clock. Proteins such as epidermal (EGF) or nerve growth factor (NGF) affect the cellular clock via extracellular signal–regulated kinases-1/2 (ERK-1/2) in NIH3T3 or neuronal stem cells, but no such data are available for the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). The hypothalamus expresses receptors for all three growth factors, acts as a central circadian pacemaker, and releases hormones in a circadian fashion. However, little is known about growth factor–induced modulation of clock gene activity in hypothalamic cells. Here, we investigated effects of IGF-1, EGF, or NGF on the Bmal-1 promoter in two hypothalamic cell lines. We found that only IGF-1 but not EGF or NGF enhanced activity of the Bmal-1 promoter. Inhibition of ERK-1/2 activity did not affect IGF-1–induced Bmal-1 promoter activation and all three growth factors similarly phosphorylated ERK-1/2, questioning a role for ERK-1/2 in controlling BMAL-1 promoter activity. Of note, only IGF-1 induced sustained phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Moreover, the GSK-3β inhibitor lithium or siRNA-mediated GSK-3β knockdown diminished the effects of IGF-1 on the Bmal-1 promoter. When IGF-1 was used in the context of temperature cycles entraining hypothalamic clock gene expression to a 24-h rhythm, it shifted the phase of Bmal-1 promoter activity, indicating that IGF-1 functions as a zeitgeber for cellular hypothalamic circadian clocks. Our results reveal that IGF-1 regulates clock gene expression and that GSK-3β but not ERK-1/2 is required for the IGF-1–mediated regulation of the Bmal-1 promoter in hypothalamic cells.

Several of the clock gene products exert a negative feedback on their own expression by inhibiting the transcriptional activation by BMAL-1 and CLOCK. The Bmal-1 promoter is controlled by two orphan nuclear receptor proteins: REV-ERBα and the retinoid orphan receptor A (RORA), with RORA activating and REV-ERBα repressing Bmal-1 expression. Because BMAL-1 is an activator of Rev-Erbα, this represents an additional feedback pathway. Through a combination of repression and activation, BMAL-1 expression rises and falls as part of the circadian cycle (7Park N. Kim H.D. Cheon S. Row H. Lee J. Han D.H. Cho S. Kim K.

To measure promoter activity under constant conditions, we stably expressed a plasmid encoding the Bmal-1 promoter (containing binding sites for REV-ERBα and RORA) fused to a luciferase gene (Bmal-1-luc) in mHypoA-2/10 cells (mHypoA-2/10-Bmal-1-luc cells). Light emission in the presence of luciferin or luciferin ethyl ester was monitored in living cells (29Brown S.A. Fleury-Olela F. Nagoshi E. Hauser C. Juge C. Meier C.A. Chicheportiche R. Dayer J.M. Albrecht U. Schibler U. The period length of fibroblast circadian gene expression varies widely among human individuals.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3 (16167846): e33810.1371/journal.pbio.0030338Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Although luminescence in mHypoA-2/10-Bmal-1-luc cells was detectable in lysates, it was too low to be measured in living cells (Fig. S1). We thus used protein lysates for measurements of Bmal-1 promoter activity in these cells. We first determined if hypothalamic cell cultures are capable of rhythmic clock gene expression. mHypoA-2/10-Bmal-1-luc cells were entrained by a protocol including serum starvation (1 h) or serum stimulation (40%, 30 min), followed by a 48-h incubation in 0.1% serum. Samples were harvested at 4-h intervals over these 2 days revealing two cycles of expression from the Bmal-1 promoter (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that the cellular clock in mHypoA-2/10-Bmal-1-luc cells was synchronized by a serum shock, showing that this cell line is a suitable model for the analysis of growth factor–induced effects on clock-regulated gene expression using the Bmal-1 promoter as a proxy. Because growth factor–induced signaling might depend on the cellular context, we also investigated the effects of growth factors on Bmal-1 promoter activity in hypothalamic cells producing the gonadotropin-releasing hormone, GT1–7 cells (41Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P.C. Padula C.A. Roberts J.L. Weiner R.I. Immortalization of hypothalamic GnRH neurons by genetically targeted tumorigenesis.Neuron. 1990; 5 (2196069): 1-1010.1016/0896-6273(90)90028-EAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Expression of the Bmal-1 reporter transiently in GT1–7 cells revealed that in these cells the Bmal-1 promoter was also synchronized by a serum shock (Fig. 1B). Thus, mHypoA-2/10-Bmal-1-luc and GT1–7 cells transiently expressing the Bmal-1-luc reporter are suitable for the analysis of growth factor–induced effects on the Bmal-1 promoter. We next used the same protocol but replaced serum with IGF-1, EGF, or NGF. We first focused on acute Bmal-1 reporter activation and analyzed the effects of growth factors on both cell types 4 and 16 h post-stimulation. Strikingly, only IGF-1 activated the Bmal-1 promoter at both time points in either cell line (Fig. 1, C and D), highlighting a hitherto unappreciated functional interaction between IGF-1 and the Bmal-1 promoter. EGF failed to induce Bmal-1 reporter activation at any time point in both cell lines. NGF promoted significant Bmal-1 promoter activity only after 4 h in GT1–7 cells. The IGF-1 concentration used (100 nm) activates both IGF and insulin receptors (42Pollak M. The insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptor family in neoplasia: an update.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12 (22548841, 22337149): 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). A recent study revealed that insulin inactivates BMAL-1 by phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear extraction via insulin receptors in hepatic cells (43Dang F. Sun X. Ma X. Wu R. Zhang D. Chen Y. Xu Q. Wu Y. Liu Y. Insulin post-transcriptionally modulates Bmal1 protein to affect the hepatic circadian clock.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27576939)1269610.1038/ncomms12696Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, to discriminate between insulin and IGF-1 receptors, we performed concentration-response curves with both hormones (Fig. 1 E and F). EC50 values of IGF-1 for activation of the BMAL-1 promoter were about 2 log orders lower compared with insulin in both cell lines (mHypoA-2/10-BMAL-luc: 1.2 ± 0.4 nm for IGF-1 and 245 ± 37 nm for insulin; GT1–7 cells: 1.5 ± 0.5 nm for IGF-1 and 117 ± 49 nm for insulin), clearly suggesting that IGF and not insulin receptors are involved. Lack of Bmal-1 promoter activation by EGF is surprising in light of its effects on clock gene expression via the Per-2 promoter in other cell lines (9Akashi M. Nishida E.

Note that PER-2 hinders the Bmal-1 suppressor REV-ERBα from its inhibitory actions on this promoter. Thus activation of the Per-2 promoter should subsequently enhance Bmal-1 promoter activity. Similar, because BMAL-1 activates E-box elements of the Per-2 promoter, activation of the Bmal-1 promoter should subsequently enhance Per-2 promoter activity (Fig. 9C). Hence, we next tested the effect of all three growth factors on a Per-2 luciferase reporter in hypothalamic cells (Fig. 1, G and H). As expected from the functional interactions between BMAL-1 and the Per-2 promoter, IGF-1 induced significant Per-2 promoter activity 16 h but not at 4 h post-stimulation, indicating that it affects first the Bmal-1 and subsequently the Per-2 promoter. EGF and NGF failed again to activate this clock gene reporter at any time and in either cell line, suggesting that both growth factors do not affect clock gene expression in hypothalamic cells at all. These results could be because these cells do not express NGF or EGF receptors. Thus, we next analyzed growth factor–induced phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 and used a luciferase reporter gene that incorporated serum-response elements (Sre) and thus would respond to activated serum-response factor (SRF) and ternary complex factors (TCF). There were no significant differences between EGF- and IGF-1–induced ERK-1"
https://openalex.org/W2890807736,"Animal-vehicle collisions have become a serious traffic safety issue. Collisions have steadily increased over the last few decades, as have their associated socio-economic costs. Here, we explore the spatial and temporal patterns of animal-vehicle collisions reported to authorities in the province of Seville, southern Spain. Most animal-vehicle collisions involved domestic animals (>95%), particularly dogs (>80%), a pattern that sharply contrasts with that found in other Spanish and European regions, where collisions are mostly caused by game species. Dog-vehicle collisions were related to the traffic intensity of the roads and they were more frequent around dawn and dusk, coinciding with the peaks of activity of dogs. This pattern was consistent throughout the week, although on weekends there were fewer collisions due to lower traffic density at those times. These findings suggest that the aggregation of dog-vehicle collisions around twilight likely resulted from a combined effect of the activity peaks of dogs and traffic density. Seasonally, collisions increased in autumn and winter, coinciding with the period of intense hunting activity in the region. Further, during autumn and winter, rush hour partly overlaps with twilight due to longer nights in comparison with summer and spring, which may contribute to the increased rate of dog-vehicle collisions in these seasons. Spatially, satellite images of nighttime lights showed that dog-vehicle collisions were clustered near urban areas. Overall, the high incidence of stray dogs involved in animal-vehicle collisions highlights a road safety issue with this type of animals in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2889646052,"Bats play key ecological roles, also hosting many zoonotic pathogens. Neotropical bat microbiota is still poorly known. We speculate that their dietary habits strongly influence their microbiota richness and antibiotic-resistance patterns, which represent growing and serious public health and environmental issue. Here we describe the aerobic microbiota richness of bats from an Atlantic Forest remnant in Southeastern Brazil, and the antibiotic-resistance patterns of bacteria of clinical importance. Oral and rectal cavities of 113 bats from Carlos Botelho State Park were swabbed. Samples were plated on 5% sheep blood and MacConkey agar and identified by the MALDI-TOF technique. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed using Kirby-Bauer's antibiotic disc diffusion technique.We identified 596 isolates at the genus level and tentatively to the species level. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all the dietary guilds, representing 87% of the total identified samples. The most common bacteria within bat individuals were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca and Serratia marcescens, and within bat species were Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas sp. and Staphylococcus sp. Frugivores presented the most diverse microbiota. In general, the antibiogram results indicated a low occurrence of resistance on eigth potentially pathogenic bacteria species. The resistance to antibiotics found on our samples was related mostly to the intrinsic resistance of the tested species.The low occurrence of resistant bacteria in our samples could be related to the well preserved environment where bats were caught. Once the major causes of resistance-acquiring are related to anthropic activites, the controlled access of tourists on certain regions of the Park seems to be effectively protecting the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2891490072,"In the first years of life, children differ greatly from adults in the temporal organization of their speech gestures in fluent language production. However, dissent remains as to the maturational direction of such organization. The present study sheds new light on this process by tracking the development of anticipatory vowel-to-vowel coarticulation in a cross-sectional investigation of 62 German children (from 3.5 to 7 years of age) and 13 adults. It focuses on gestures of the tongue, a complex organ whose spatiotemporal control is indispensable for speech production. The goal of the study was threefold: 1) investigate whether children as well as adults initiate the articulation for a target vowel in advance of its acoustic onset, 2) test if the identity of the intervocalic consonant matters and finally, 3) describe age-related developments of these lingual coarticulatory patterns. To achieve this goal, ultrasound tongue imaging was used to record lingual movements and quantify changes in coarticulation degree as a function of consonantal context and age. Results from linear mixed effects models indicate that like adults, children initiate vowels' lingual gestures well ahead of their acoustic onset. Second, while the identity of the intervocalic consonant affects the degree of vocalic anticipation in adults, it does not in children at any age. Finally, the degree of vowel-to-vowel coarticulation is significantly higher in all cohorts of children than in adults. However, among children, a developmental decrease of vocalic coarticulation is only found for sequences including the alveolar stop /d/ which requires finer spatiotemporal coordination of the tongue's subparts compared to labial and velar stops. Altogether, results suggest greater gestural overlap in child than in adult speech and support the view of a non-uniform and protracted maturation of lingual coarticulation calling for thorough considerations of the articulatory intricacies from which subtle developmental differences may originate."
https://openalex.org/W2891507723,"The present study aimed to assess socioeconomic inequalities in general and mental health, depression and substance use disorders (daily tobacco use, hazardous alcohol use). Data from the 2010 SIRS (French acronym for Health, Inequalities, and Social Ruptures) study, which is deemed to be representative of the French-speaking adult population living in the Paris Metropolitan Area, were analysed. Different socioeconomic position indicators were selected: education, income and perceived financial status. Absolute measures (the slope index of inequality (SII)) and relative measures (the odds ratio (OR) and relative index of inequality (RII)) of health inequalities were used. The OR, RII and SII were adjusted for age, household type and migration characteristics and all analyses were performed separately for men and women. The study included 3,006 adults. The results showed significant relative and absolute socioeconomic inequalities in general, mental health and depression for all socioeconomic position indicators considered (education, income, and perceived financial status). The absolute inequalities were greater for women than for men. Strongest inequalities were observed by perceived financial status for men and women. Education seemed to play a stronger role in inequalities for women, whereas, for men, income seemed to play a stronger role. Only few socioeconomic inequalities were found in daily tobacco use, while a reversed gradient was observed for hazardous alcohol use. We hope that these results will be regularly re-evaluated and compared across time in order to monitor socioeconomic inequalities in health."

In this paper, we are focusing on the development of a novel bivalent typhoidal Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) based immunogen against enteric fever. We have isolated Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A OMVs and also characterized OMVs associated antigens. Then we immunized adult mice with three doses of our newly formulated bivalent immunogen orally (25 μg/200 μl). After three doses of oral immunization, we found our immunogen could significantly induce humoral response. We have also found serum IgG against LPS, Vi-polysaccharide etc. OMV immunization induces CD4, CD8 and CD19 population in immunized mice spleen. It also induces Th1 and Th17-cell mediated immunity. We also found bivalent OMVs immunization can prevent more than lethal dose of heterologous Salmonella strains mediated systemic infection in adult mice model. We determined that, the protective immune responses depend on the humoral and cell-mediated immune response. Furthermore, we have evaluated the mode of protective immune response carried out by anti-OMVs antibody by significantly inhibiting bacterial motility and mucin penetration ability. Taken together, these findings suggest that our bivalent immunogen could be used as a novel candidate vaccine against enteric fever."

Understanding more about their male sexual partners can inform HIV prevention efforts for both. Methods Using the PLACE methodology across all 19 DREAMS implementation districts, 843 men ages 20–34 were surveyed between December 2016-February 2017. Surveys were conducted at 182 venues identified by community informants as places where AGYW and men meet/socialize. Descriptive and multivariate analyses examined characteristics and risk behaviors of male partners of AGYW. Results Men’s average age was 25.7. Sixty-three percent reported female partners ages 15–19, and 70% reported partners ages 20–24 in the last year; of those, 12% and 11% respectively had five or more such partners. Among the 568 male partners of AGYW, 36% reported consistent condom use with their current/last partner. Forty-two percent reported testing for HIV in the last year; 6% were HIV-positive, and of those, 97% were currently on treatment. One-third (37%) reported being circumcised; among uncircumcised, 81% were not considering it. In multivariate analyses, men who reported three or more AGYW partners in the last year were more likely to be HIV-positive (aOR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1,8.8). Men were also less likely to disclose their HIV status to adolescent versus older partners (aOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4,0.9) and partners more than 5 years younger than themselves (aOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4,0.9). Results also revealed relatively high unemployment and mobility, substantial financial responsibilities, and periodic homelessness. Conclusions Most men identified through community venues reported relationships with AGYW, and these relationships demonstrated substantial HIV risk. Challenging life circumstances suggest structural factors may underlie some risk behaviors. Engaging men in HIV prevention and targeted health services is critical, and informant-identified community venues are promising intervention sites to reach high-risk male partners of AGYW."

This study aimed to investigate RCT changes in a murine model of obesity.Ob/ob and control mice were injected with [3H]-cholesterol-labelled macrophages and cholesterol accumulation quantified after 48 h. Ex vivo, cholesterol efflux and uptake were determined in hepatic and adipose tissues.Ob/ob mice had more labelled cholesterol in their plasma (86%, p<0.001), suggesting impaired RCT. SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux was elevated from ob/ob mice (serum, 33%; apoB-depleted plasma, 14%, p<0.01) and HDL-c were also higher (60%, p<0.01). Ex vivo it was found that cholesterol uptake was significantly lower into the livers and adipose tissue of ob/ob mice, compared to non-obese wildtype controls. Furthermore, ex vivo cholesterol efflux was reduced in ob/ob liver and adipose tissue towards apoA-I and HDL. Consistent with this, protein levels of SR-BI and ABCG1 were significantly lower in ob/ob hepatic and adipose tissue than in wildtype mice. Finally, labelled cholesterol concentrations were lower in ob/ob bile (67%, p<0.01) and faeces (76%, p<0.0001).Obesity causes impairment in RCT due to reduced plasma cholesterol uptake and efflux by hepatocytes and adipocytes. A reduction in the capacity for plasma cholesterol clearance may partly account for increased CVD risk with obesity."

Here, using enzyme mutagenesis, NMR, stopped-flow spectroscopy, and LC–MS, we found that the NADH cofactor and the CoA thioester substrate form a covalent adduct during the InhA catalytic cycle. We used the isolated adduct as a molecular probe to directly access the second half-reaction of the catalytic cycle of InhA (i.e. the proton transfer), independently of the first half-reaction (i.e. the initial hydride transfer) and to assign functions to two conserved active-site residues, Tyr-158 and Thr-196. We found that Tyr-158 is required for the stereospecificity of protonation and that Thr-196 is partially involved in hydride transfer and protonation. The natural tendency of InhA to form a covalent C2-ene adduct calls for a careful reconsideration of the enzyme’s reaction mechanism. It also provides the basis for the development of effective tools to study, manipulate, and inhibit the catalytic cycle of InhA and related enzymes of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily.

Metabolomics can provide information on the molecular profiles of tissues, which can aid in investigating postmortem metabolite changes. In this study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric (LC-MS) analysis was performed to identify the metabolic profiles of rat femoral muscle at ten periods of time after death within 168 h. The results obtained by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC)- and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)- electrospray ionization (ESI±) have revealed more than 16,000 features from all four datasets. Furthermore, 915 of these features were identified using an in-house database. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated the time-specific features of molecular profiling at each period of time after death. Moreover, results from partial least squares projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) disclosed a strong association of metabolic alterations of at least 59 metabolites with the time since death, especially within 48 h after death, which expounds these metabolites as potential indicators in PMI estimation. Altogether, our results illustrate the potentiality of metabolic profiling in the evaluation of PMI and provide candidate metabolite markers with strong correlation with time since death for forensic purpose."

The consequence of CPD-related obstructive labor in the absence of a Caesarian section (C/S) is often maternal or perinatal mortality or morbidity to the mother and/or the infant. Accurate and timely referral of at-risk mothers to health facilities where C/S is a delivery option could reduce maternal mortality in the developing world. The goal of this work was to develop and test the feasibility of a safe, low-cost, easy-to-use, portable tool, using a Microsoft Kinect 3D camera, to identify women at risk for obstructed labor due to CPD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, 3D camera imaging, anthropometry and clinical pelvimetry were collected and analyzed from women 18-40 years of age, at gestational age ≥36+0 weeks with previous C/S due to CPD (n = 43), previous uncomplicated vaginal deliveries (n = 96), and no previous obstetric history (n = 148) from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Novel and published CPD risk scores based on anthropometry, clinical pelvimetry, MRI, and Kinect measurements were compared. Significant differences were observed in most anthropometry, clinical pelvimetry, MRI and Kinect measurements between women delivering via CPD-related C/S versus those delivering vaginally. The area under the receiver-operator curve from novel CPD risk scores base on MRI-, Kinect-, and anthropometric-features outperformed novel CPD risk scores based on clinical pelvimetry and previously published indices for CPD risk calculated from these data; e.g., pelvic inlet area, height, and fetal-pelvic index. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a 3D camera-based platform for assessing CPD risk as a novel, safe, scalable approach to better predict risk of CPD in Ethiopia and warrants the need for further blinded, prospective studies to refine and validate the proposed CPD risk scores, which are required before this method can be applied clinically."

X-ray crystallographic studies of the plant plasma membrane proton pump have provided information on amino acids involved in ATP catalysis but provided no information on the structure of the C-terminal regulatory domain. Despite progress in elucidating enzymes involved in the signaling pathways that activate or inhibit this pump, the site of interaction of the C-terminal regulatory domain with the catalytic domains remains a mystery. Genetic studies have pointed to amino acids in various parts of the protein that may be involved, but direct chemical evidence for which ones are specifically interacting with the C terminus is lacking. In this study, we used in vivo cross-linking experiments with a photoreactive unnatural amino acid, p-benzoylphenylalanine, and tandem MS to obtain direct evidence that the C-terminal regulatory domain interacts with amino acids located within the N-terminal actuator domain. Our observations are consistent with a mechanism in which intermolecular, rather than intramolecular, interactions are involved. Our model invokes a “head-to-tail” organization of ATPase monomers in which the C-terminal domain of one ATPase molecule interacts with the actuator domain of another ATPase molecule. This model serves to explain why cross-linked peptides are found only in dimers and trimers, and it is consistent with prior studies suggesting that within the membrane the protein can be organized as homopolymers, including dimers, trimers, and hexamers.

Our observations are consistent with a mechanism in which intermolecular, rather than intramolecular, interactions are involved. Our model invokes a “head-to-tail” organization of ATPase monomers in which the C-terminal domain of one ATPase molecule interacts with the actuator domain of another ATPase molecule. This model serves to explain why cross-linked peptides are found only in dimers and trimers, and it is consistent with prior studies suggesting that within the membrane the protein can be organized as homopolymers, including dimers, trimers, and hexamers."
https://openalex.org/W2890318829,"The RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) is the major scaffold protein for assembly of neuronal gene silencing complexes that suppress gene transcription through regulating the surrounding chromatin structure. REST represses neuronal gene expression in stem cells and non-neuronal cells, but it is minimally expressed in neuronal cells to ensure proper neuronal development. Dysregulation of REST function has been implicated in several cancers and neurological diseases. Modulating REST gene silencing is challenging because cellular and developmental differences can affect its activity. We therefore considered the possibility of modulating REST activity through its regulatory proteins. The human small C-terminal domain phosphatase 1 (SCP1) regulates the phosphorylation state of REST at sites that function as REST degradation checkpoints. Using kinetic analysis and direct visualization with X-ray crystallography, we show that SCP1 dephosphorylates two degron phosphosites of REST with a clear preference for phosphoserine 861 (pSer-861). Furthermore, we show that SCP1 stabilizes REST protein levels, which sustains REST's gene silencing function in HEK293 cells. In summary, our findings strongly suggest that REST is a bona fide substrate for SCP1 in vivo and that SCP1 phosphatase activity protects REST against degradation. These observations indicate that targeting REST via its regulatory protein SCP1 can modulate its activity and alter signaling in this essential developmental pathway.

REST recognizes a DNA motif called the RE1 element found near target genes and recruits several critical transcriptional co-regulators to silence their expression (3Ballas N. Grunseich C. Lu D.D. Speh J.C. Mandel G.

It has been estimated that expression of up to 10% of neuronal genes are subject to regulation by REST (4Otto S.J. McCorkle S.R. Hover J. Conaco C. Han J.J. Impey S. Yochum G.S. Dunn J.J.

Dysregulation of REST has been implicated in multiple diseases. REST function is critical in embryonic development as elimination of REST leads to neonatal death in mice (9Aoki H. Hara A. Era T. Kunisada T. Yamada Y. Genetic ablation of Rest leads to in vitro-specific derepression of neuronal genes during neurogenesis.Development. 2012; 139 (22241837): 667-67710.1242/dev.072272Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). REST protein levels are significantly up-regulated in several cases of mesenchymal and classical glioma tumors (10Kamal M.M. Sathyan P. Singh S.K. Zinn P.O. Marisetty A.L. Liang S. Gumin J.

In glioblastomas exhibiting high levels of REST expression, REST appears to be a key factor in maintaining tumor growth as knockdown of REST results in shrinkage of these tumors (10Kamal M.M.

In addition, up-regulation of REST has been implicated in other brain tumors such as medulloblastomas (12Lawinger P. Venugopal R. Guo Z.S. Immaneni A. Sengupta D. Lu W. Rastelli L.

However, in non-neuronal tumors, such as epithelial-derived tumors, REST activity is suppressed possibly because of its potential tumor suppressor function (14Westbrook T.F. Martin E.S.

The contradictory role of REST in both oncogenesis and tumor suppression in different cell types suggests its role in gene regulation and cellular phenotype is highly context-dependent. Maintaining appropriate levels of REST target gene suppression is important for the fitness of cells even in the brain. Basal expression of REST in mature neurons is generally low, but in certain regions of the brain REST levels increase upon aging, whereas a deficiency of REST in these regions is associated with Alzheimer's disease (16Lu T. Aron L. Zullo J. Pan Y. Kim H. Chen Y. Yang T.H. Kim H.M. Drake D. Liu X.S. Bennett D.A. Colaiácovo M.P.

A molecular explanation for this observation is that REST silences genes that promote apoptosis, and as certain brain cells age these genes can become active when REST levels do not rise to maintain silencing and lead to cell death (16Lu T. Aron L. Zullo J. Pan Y. Kim H. Chen Y. Yang T.H. Kim H.M. Drake D. Liu X.S. Bennett D.A. Colaiácovo M.P.

Abnormal expression of REST has also been observed in other neurological diseases including Parkinson's (17Yu M. Cai L. Liang M. Huang Y. Gao H. Lu S. Fei J. Huang F.

The difficulty in studying the molecular mechanisms of REST in stem cells and disease states lies in the lack of effective tools to manipulate REST activity. Genetic tools like shRNA have been frequently used to determine the effects of manipulating REST levels on RE1 gene expression and cellular phenotype (8Mukherjee S. Brulet R. Zhang L. Hsieh J.

Small molecule inhibitors would provide the advantage of instantaneous temporal control, reversibility, and ease of application. Unfortunately, transcription factors like REST, whose activity depends on their ability to participate in protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, are difficult to target with small molecules. Therefore, the regulatory enzymes of REST represent potential alternative targets to control REST function. In cells, REST has a high turnover rate mediated by phosphorylation of its C-terminal domain that targets it for proteasomal degradation via Skp1-Cul1-F-box β-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin ligase (SCFβ-TrCP)-dependent ubiquitination (23Westbrook T.F. Hu G. Ang X.L. Mulligan P. Pavlova N.N. Liang A. Leng Y. Maehr R. Shi Y. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J.

Cell-focused studies suggest that a human phosphatase, the small C-terminal domain phosphatase 1 (SCP1), promotes REST function through regulation of this pathway (24Yeo M. Lee S.K. Lee B. Ruiz E.C. Pfaff S.L. Gill G.N.

First, SCP1 was found to be expressed in similar cell types as REST and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicates they physically associate within cells (24Yeo M. Lee S.K. Lee B. Ruiz E.C. Pfaff S.L. Gill G.N. Small CTD phosphatases function in silencing neuronal gene expression.Science. 2005; 307 (15681389): 596-60010.1126/science.1100801Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a positive feedback loop has been identified between SCP1 and REST that discloses a close partnership in their functions (25Xue Y. Ouyang K. Huang J. Zhou Y. Ouyang H. Li H. Wang G. Wu Q. Wei C. Bi Y. Jiang L. Cai Z. Sun H. Zhang K. Zhang Y. Chen J. Fu X.D. Direct conversion of fibroblasts to neurons by reprogramming PTB-regulated microRNA circuits.Cell. 2013; 152 (23313552): 82-9610.1016/j.cell.2012.11.045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Expression of SCP1 in cells results in removal of phosphate marks from a degron region at the C terminus of REST, stabilizing the protein and protecting it from degradation (26Nesti E. Corson G.M. McCleskey M. Oyer J.A. Mandel G. C-terminal domain small phosphatase 1 and MAP kinase reciprocally control REST stability and neuronal differentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111 (25197063): E3929-E393610.1073/pnas.1414770111Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Altogether, there seems to be a strong correlation between the phosphatase activity of SCP1 and the gene silencing function of REST. In this paper, we demonstrate that SCP1 can enzymatically dephosphorylate the Ser-861 and Ser-864 degron phosphosites of REST and quantify rates of dephosphorylation of each site to determine the preferred substrate for SCP1. We also visualized the physical interactions between these proteins by determining the complex structures of phosphorylated REST peptides bound at the active site of SCP1. Extending our analysis to mammalian cells, we find that reduction of SCP1 with shRNA or overexpression of a dominant-negative SCP1 leads to a decrease in REST protein levels. This reduction in REST protein results in increased expression of genes normally repressed by REST. Overall, our data shows that the phosphatase activity of SCP1 controls REST protein stability. Therefore, control of SCP1 enzymatic activity represents a promising avenue to control REST function. In cells, overexpression of SCP1 increases REST dephosphorylation (26Nesti E. Corson G.M. McCleskey M. Oyer J.A. Mandel G. C-terminal domain small phosphatase 1 and MAP kinase reciprocally control REST stability and neuronal differentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111 (25197063): E3929-E393610.1073/pnas.1414770111Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To test if SCP1 can directly dephosphorylate REST, we obtained 12-mer synthetic peptides with the sequenceEDLSPPSPPLPK from the C-terminal region of REST(858–869), where two degron sites are located (23Westbrook T.F. Hu G. Ang X.L. Mulligan P. Pavlova N.N. Liang A. Leng Y. Maehr R. Shi Y. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. SCFβ-TRCP controls oncogenic transformation and neural differentiation through REST degradation.Nature. 2008; 452 (18354483): 370-37410.1038/nature06780Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The peptides are synthetically defined and phosphorylated at Ser-861 (REST–pS861 peptide), Ser-864 (REST–pS864 peptide), or both (REST-pS861/4 peptide; Table S1). The phosphatase activities of SCP1 against these peptides were quantified by malachite green assays (27Zhang Y. Kim Y. Genoud N. Gao J. Kelly J.W. Pfaff S.L. Gill G.N. Dixon J.E. Noel J.P. Determinants for dephosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain by Scp1.Mol. Cell. 2006; 24 (17157258): 759-77010.1016/j.molcel.2006.10.027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The kcat of SCP1 against the REST–pS861 peptide was 23 ± 2 s−1 and the Km was measured to be 160 ± 40 μm (kcat/Km of 140 ± 60 mm−1 s−1) (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, SCP1 had weak activity when only Ser-864 is phosphorylated (Fig. 1A). These results demonstrate that pSer-861 of REST is the preferred dephosphorylation site for SCP1 compared with pSer-864. When both Ser-861 and Ser-864 are phosphorylated, SCP1 still shows strong phosphatase activity (kcat/Km of is determined to be 80 ± 40 mm−1 s−1). To test whether both phosphorylations are removed by SCP1, we incubated SCP1 with the doubly phosphorylated Ser-861/864 REST peptide and monitored the reaction with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS. MALDI-TOF analysis clearly showed a size difference of ∼160 Da between the major peaks in the untreated and SCP1-treated reactions indicating a loss of two phosphate groups (Fig. 1B). Dephosphorylation of the doubly phosphorylated REST peptide was specific to SCP1 as a single point mutation in SCP1 (D96N) abolishes activity (Fig. S1). Overall, these results clearly indicate that SCP1 can dephosphorylate REST at its C-terminal domain at both Ser-861 and Ser-864, with Ser-861 as the preferred site. Because Ser-861 appears to be the primary site for SCP1 dephosphorylation and mutation of both Ser-861 and Ser-864 sites to alanine abolishes interaction with REST (26Nesti E. Corson G.M. McCleskey M. Oyer J.A. Mandel G. C-terminal domain small phosphatase 1 and MAP kinase reciprocally control REST stability and neuronal differentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111 (25197063): E3929-E393610.1073/pnas.1414770111Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we suspect that phosphorylation of Ser-861 plays a key role in recruiting SCP1 and tethers it to the substrate to dephosphorylate both sites. To directly visualize the molecular interaction between REST and SCP1, we crystalized SCP1 in complex with the phosphorylated peptides derived from the C-terminal domain of REST (Fig. 2). Because SCP1 is active against REST peptides as shown in the kinetic assays, we used a catalytically deficient variant of SCP1 in which the nucleophilic aspartate 96 is replaced by asparagine (D96N) to prevent phosphoryl adduct formation (28Zhang M. Liu J. Kim Y. Dixon J.E. Pfaff S.L. Gill G.N. Noel J.P. Zhang Y.

This D96N variant allows for effective substrate recognition but prevents nucleophilic attack required for phosphate transfer (27Zhang Y. Kim Y. Genoud N. Gao J. Kelly J.W. Pfaff S.L. Gill G.N.

We obtained SCP1 D96N variant crystals and soaked the phosphorylated REST peptides into the pre-formed crystals. To identify the primary site of recognition using an unbiased approach, we first tried to obtain the complex structure of SCP1 D96N with the doubly phosphorylated Ser-861/864 REST peptide by soaking.

Open table in a new tab Compared with the previously solved apo-SCP1 structure (29Kamenski T. Heilmeier S. Meinhart A. Cramer P. Structure and mechanism of RNA polymerase II CTD phosphatases.Mol.

However, strong positive density for the serine–proline motif was observed at the active site of SCP1, indicating incorporation of the ligand (Fig. S2). This allowed us to confidently build six of the 12 residues of the REST peptide into the electron density (Fig. 2B). Iterative building of the peptide into experimental density made it clear that the preferred phosphoserine at SCP1's active site was pSer-861, which was consistent with our kinetic results showing that SCP1 highly favors pSer-861 over pSer-864. The phosphate group of pSer-861 replaces a water molecule to coordinate a magnesium ion bound at the active site (Fig. 2C). The magnesium ion is coordinated in a dipyrimidal mode with the two conserved aspartate residues from the catalytic DXDXE motif (Asn-96 in the structure) along with Asn-207 from atop and two water molecules to each side (Fig. 2C). In addition to coordinating the magnesium ion, pSer-861 also forms extensive interactions with SCP1. The phosphate group is anchored through hydrophilic interaction with the side chains of Asn-96, Lys-190, and Thr-152 as well as the amide group of Ala-153 (Fig. 2C). The N- and C-terminal residues of the peptide show little density but would seem to extend toward bulk solvent. The doubly phosphorylated REST peptide forms a tight hairpin around Pro-863, which allows the peptide to conform to the binding pocket of SCP1 (Fig. 2D). An intramolecular hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of Pro-862 and the amide group of pSer-864 appears to stabilize this hairpin structure (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl of Pro-863 and the side chain of Asn-187 (Fig. 2D) as well as phosphate group of pSer-864 and the carbonyl of Gly-186 (Fig. 2E) seem to stabilize the binding mode of the peptide. Pro-865 also sits over a hydrophobic surface at the edge of the SCP1-binding pocket formed by the aromatic side chains of Phe-183 and Tyr-188 (Fig. 2E). The residues preceding the target phosphoserine of SCP1 substrates have previously been found to be important for recognition by fitting into a unique hydrophobic pocket (27Zhang Y. Kim Y. Genoud N. Gao J. Kelly J.W. Pfaff S.L. Gill G.N. Dixon J.E. Noel J.P. Determinants for dephosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain by Scp1.Mol.

Indeed, Leu-860 of the REST peptide forms favorable hydrophobic interactions with Phe-106, Leu-127, and Tyr-158 of the SCP1 hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 2F). Tyr-158 of SCP1 is essential for binding of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (Fig. S3) as replacing this residue with alanine is sufficient to eliminate SCP1's substrate specificity without affecting enzymatic activity (27Zhang Y. Kim Y. Genoud N. Gao J. Kelly J.W. Pfaff S.L. Gill G.N. Dixon J.E. Noel J.P. Determinants for dephosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain by Scp1.Mol.

Furthermore, this pocket is also critical for SCP1 recognition of the small molecular inhibitor rabeprazole (30Zhang M. Cho E.J. Burstein G. Siegel D. Zhang Y. Selective inactivation of a human neuronal silencing phosphatase by a small molecule inhibitor.ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6 (21348431): 511-51910.1021/cb100357tCrossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as its sulfoxide group sits over Tyr-158 (Fig. S3). Overall, the structure of SCP1 bound to the doubly phosphorylated REST peptide supports our hypothesis that pSer-861 is the preferred dephosphorylation site and suggests that SCP1 specificity toward REST is dominated by hydrophobic interactions on either side of phosphorylated substrate residue. We next attempted to obtain complex structures of SCP1 D96N with REST peptides phosphorylated either at Ser-861 or Ser-864. The conditions used to obtain these protein–ligand complexes were kept highly consistent to make the resultant structures as comparable as possible. The structure of SCP1 bound to the pSer-861 peptide was determined at a resolution of 2.55 Å, which was comparable with the doubly phosphorylated peptide structure (Table 1). The pSer-861 peptide showed strong positive density for the SP motif at the active site (Fig. S2) and could be reliably built into the density (Fig. 3A). An additional residue at the N-terminal end of the pSer-861 peptide, Asp-859, can be built into the density compared with the pSer-861/864 doubly phosphorylated REST peptide (Fig. 3A). The pSer-861 and pSer-861/864 REST peptides shared an almost identical binding mode in SCP1 (Fig. 3B), which is consistent with our kinetics showing that SCP1 prefers recognition of the pSer-861 site compared with the pSer-864 site."

We executed time dependent experiments to illustrate the formation mechanism of sodium niobate nanocubes. It was observed that the morphology of NaNbO3 nanocubes was dependent on the reaction time and 12hr reaction time was found to be suitable. Morphology, composition, structure and optical properties of sodium niobate nanocubes were evaluated by scanning electron microscope, X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometer, X-ray diffraction and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrometer. The photocatalytic activity of sodium niobate was studied for photocatalytic hydrogen production. It was anticipated that the sodium niobate (NaNbO3) cubes exhibited good photocatalytic activity under UV light irradiation using lactic acid as sacrificial agent. The cytotoxicity activity of sodium niobate nanocubes was studied as well at different concentrations (5 mg/mL, 3 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, and 0.25 mg/mL) against human colon colorectal carcinoma cell line (HCT116) by MTT assay and EC50 was found to be 1.9 mg/mL. Sodium niobate proved to be a good DPPH free radical scavenging material, tested at different concentrations. It was noticed that peak intensity at 517 nm was decreased after 30 minute incubation, further supporting the antioxidant activity. This study will be useful for design and engineering of materials that can be used in biomedical applications and in photocatalysis."

Three hundred and eighty HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy as an initial treatment in Kumamoto University were enrolled as a test cohort. The outcome was confirmed with a validation cohort in Kyushu University.Macrotrabecular (macro-T) subtype (n = 38) and compact subtype (n = 43) showed similar biological and prognostic features. Both showed higher AFP level and worse overall survival than microrabecular (micro-T) subtype (n = 266). Multivariate analysis for overall survival revealed that DCP ≥ 40, multiple tumor and macro-T/compact subtype were associated with poor overall survival (risk ratio = 2.2, 1.6 and 1.6; p = 0.002, 0.020, and 0.047, respectively). Of note, 32% of macro-T/compact subtype showed early recurrence within 1 year, which showed substantially low (5%) 5 year overall survival, whereas 16% of micro-T/PG subtype did. Twenty-one percent of macro-T/compact subtype showed multiple intrahepatic metastases (≥ 4) or distant metastases, which resulted in non-curative treatment, whereas 5% of micro-T/PG subtype did. In validation cohort, macro-T/compact subtype was an independent predictor of worse overall survival.Macro-T/compact subtype is biologically discriminated from micro-T and PG subtypes due to its aggressive features and poor prognosis after curative treatment. Additional treatment with curative hepatectomy on Macro-T/compact subtype should be discussed because of high possibility of systemic residual cancer cell."
https://openalex.org/W2890498514,"G-quadruplexes (G4s) are four-stranded DNA structures comprising stacks of four guanines, are prevalent in genomes, and have diverse biological functions in various chromosomal structures. A conserved protein, Rap1-interacting factor 1 (Rif1) from fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), binds to Rif1-binding sequence (Rif1BS) and regulates DNA replication timing. Rif1BS is characterized by the presence of multiple G-tracts, often on both strands, and their unusual spacing. Although previous studies have suggested generation of G4-like structures on duplex Rif1BS, its precise molecular architecture remains unknown. Using gel-shift DNA binding assays and DNA footprinting with various nuclease probes, we show here that both of the Rif1BS strands adopt specific higher-order structures upon heat denaturation. We observed that the structure generated on the G-strand is consistent with a G4 having unusually long loop segments and that the structure on the complementary C-strand does not have an intercalated motif (i-motif). Instead, we found that the formation of the C-strand structure depends on the G4 formation on the G-strand. Thus, the higher-order structure generated at Rif1BS involved both DNA strands, and in some cases, G4s may form on both of these strands. The presence of multiple G-tracts permitted the formation of alternative structures when some G-tracts were mutated or disrupted by deazaguanine replacement, indicating the robust nature of DNA higher-order structures generated at Rif1BS. Our results provide general insights into DNA structures generated at G4-forming sequences on duplex DNA."

It is currently a growing health problem worldwide affecting from 1% to 14% of all pregnant women depending on racial and ethnic group as well as the diagnostic and screening criteria. Our preliminary study aimed at investigating the erythrocyte membrane fatty acid profiles of pregnant women, in particular with diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and with normal glucose tolerant (NGT) pregnant women as a control group. The study group comprised 43 pregnant women, 32 of whom were diagnosed with GDM according to the WHO criteria, and 11 with normal glucose tolerance. The erythrocyte membrane phospholipids were obtained according to the Folch extraction procedure. Fatty acids (FA) were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) as the corresponding fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). A cluster of 14 fatty acids identified contained >98% of the recognized peaks in the GC analysis. The analysis of fatty acids from erythrocytes revealed important differences between GDM and NGT women in the third trimester, and the results were correlated with biochemical data. Among the 14 measured FA representing the membrane lipidomic profile, the levels of three saturated FA (myristic, palmitic, stearic acids) tended to decrease in GDM patients, with the percentage content of stearic acid significantly changed. The relative content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) tended to increase, in particular the oleic acid and vaccenic acid contents were significantly increased in erythrocyte membranes of the GDM group in comparison with the NGT group. The GDM group demonstrated higher sapienic acid levels (+29%) but this change was not statistically significant. This study revealed association between an impaired cis-vaccenic acid concentration in erythrocytes membrane and GDM development. No significant changes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were observed in GDM and NGT erythrocytes. We postulate, basing on the differences between the GDM and NGT lipidomic profiles, that stearic and cis-vaccenic acids can be considered as dual biomarkers of specific SFA-MUFA conversion pathway, involving the coupling of delta-9 desaturase and elongase enzymes. Our results indicate that the SFA-MUFA families may be involved in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases such as GDM, but the further studies are needed to confirm our hypothesis. In conclusion, the erythrocyte membranes of GDM women undergo remodeling resulting in abnormal fatty acid profiles, which are reflection of the long-term status of organism and can have great impact on both the mother and her offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2891959526,"People with Intellectual disability (ID) are likely to be prescribed psychotropic medication particularly antipsychotics without a clear clinical indication. This has given rise to a national initiative in the UK to stop overprescribing medication in this vulnerable population. While the goals are simple it is unclear if specialist ID services or primary care services in the UK should look to lead. Further, it is uncertain if primary care practitioners (GPs) can be systematically educated of the latest good practice developments and concerns in this specialised area. This study surveyed the knowledge level of a sample of GPs in Cornwall UK (county of 538,000) post a structured tutorial on psychotropic medication and people with ID.A 21 item questionnaire was delivered in meetings organised for all the county GPs a year after a talk given to the same demographic. The questionnaire conducted an assessment of the knowledge of national guidance on use of psychotropic medication in ID based on the subjects covered in the tutorial.Of the 60 expected GP participants the tutorial was attended by 44 GPs (73%) and the follow up meeting by 42 (70%). Ninety percent GPs in the follow up meeting filled the questionnaire. For 16 questions, more than 80% GPs gave correct responses whereas five questions attracted a correct answer from less than 80%. Majority of the GPs felt psychotropic medication management in people with ID should be specialist led.GPs' knowledge of issues relevant to prescribing in people with ID benefitted from the tutorial. However a clear need for the psychotropic medication management to be delivered via specialist care emerged. This raises issues of resource allocation and debate on whether people with ID require specialist provision due to lack of ability in main stream primary care to manage their needs."

Molecular subtyping has been widely used to dissect inter-tumor biological heterogeneity, in relation to clinical outcomes. A key step of this methodology is to perform unsupervised classification of gene expression profiles, which, however, often suffers challenges of high-dimensionality, feature redundancy as well as noise and irrelevant information. To overcome these limitations, we propose ELM-CC, which employs hidden observation features obtained from extreme learning machines (ELMs) for cancer classification. To demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness, we applied ELM-CC for gastric and ovarian cancer subtyping. Comparing with the widely-used consensus clustering method, our approach demonstrated much better clustering performance and identified molecular subtypes that are much more clinically relevant."
https://openalex.org/W2890851442,"Background Ensuring reduction in transmission of lymphatic Filariasis (LF) and addressing the compliance of people to mass drug administration (MDA) has led to renewed efforts in the field. School-based health education (SBHE) intervention, considered a cost-effective strategy with potential to reach the wider public through young people, was adopted as a strategy for social mobilization. This study assessed SBHE perceptions, implementation barriers, and factors in the supporting environment as well as its efficiency to successfully change LF MDA-related knowledge and practice. Methods This mixed methods study was conducted in four sites of Lalitpur district, Nepal. Classroom-based interactive health education sessions were used as the main intervention strategy in the study. In total, 572 students were assigned to intervention and control groups. Questionnaires were distributed before and after the intervention. Mann-Whitney and McNemar tests were used for analysis. Focus-group discussions with teachers and students and in-depth interviews with the district LF program manager as well as Education Office and school management authorities were conducted. Qualitative thematic analysis approach was adopted. Results Intervention curriculum played a significant role in increasing children’s knowledge and practice (p<0.001). Barriers for school-based interventions were budget constraints, human resource deficiencies, lack of opportunities to conduct practical classes under the curriculum, and lack of collaboration with parents. Supportive factors were training provision, monitoring and evaluation practice, adequate facilities and equipment, positive parental attitudes, presence of interested teachers and students, and prioritization by program implementers. Conclusion Effective program planning practices such as proper fiscal management, human resource management, training mechanisms, and efforts to promote practical classes and coordination with parents are required to develop and institutionalize the intervention. Effective learning and a supportive school environment appear to be important components to support implementation. The SBHE intervention is a feasible and promising intervention for accelerating compliance towards MDA to eliminate LF."

Many native heme-containing proteins can be produced in Escherichia coli either by relying on bacterial heme biosynthesis, by adding heme precursors during recombinant expression, or by expressing the apoprotein and reconstituting with PPIX during purification.

Whereas this method can also work well for the more stable soluble cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (7Wagner G.C. Gunsalus I.C. Wang M.Y. Hoffman B.M. Cobalt-substituted cytochrome P-450cam.J. Biol.

Membrane cytochrome P450 enzymes can often be expressed recombinantly in E. coli as the holoprotein with a proximal cysteine thiolate coordinating the Fe3+ of heme b or iron protoporphyrin IX. Endogenous E. coli heme biosynthesis is usually supported by supplementing growth medium with the nonmetal heme precursor δ-aminolevulinic acid. The δ-aminolevulinic acid is readily taken up by E. coli, where it is used in heme synthesis by bacterial enzymes, and the heme is endogenously inserted into a human P450 polypeptide to produce enzymatically active protein. In contrast, heme (FePPIX) is not readily taken up by E. coli, so providing this or other metal-substituted PPIX to the P450-expressing bacteria requires additional engineering. The soluble bacterial P450 BM3 has been generated with manganese protoporphyrin IX (MnPPIX) instead of FePPIX by supplementing induction medium with MnPPIX and coexpressing the heme transporter chuA to promote its uptake (9Lelyveld V.S. Brustad E. Arnold F.H. Jasanoff A. Metal-substituted protein MRI contrast agents engineered for enhanced relaxivity and ligand sensitivity.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133 (21171606): 649-65110.1021/ja107936dCrossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Another soluble bacterial thermophilic P450 protein (CYP119) has been generated by limiting iron and providing cobalt in the induction medium, relying on intrinsic bacterial uptake of the metal and endogenous ferrocheletase incorporation of cobalt into the protoporphyrin framework (10Straub W.E. Nishida C.R. de Montellano P.R. Expression in Escherichia coli of a cytochrome P450 enzyme with a cobalt protoporphyrin IX prosthetic group.Methods Mol.

Despite the significant potential contributions in probing human P450 function and structure, we have found no reports of successful generation of metal-substituted membrane cytochrome P450 enzymes, which even in their native FePPIX state are often quasi-stable. Herein, we describe a method for generating human membrane cytochrome P450 proteins containing metals other than iron in the protoporphyrin. To determine how broadly applicable this method might be, we have evaluated exogenous PPIX uptake and incorporation into both the steroidogenic P450 enzymes CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 and drug-metabolizing CYP3A4. More detailed studies with the least stable of these enzymes, CYP17A1, demonstrated the ability to incorporate other metals without significant structural changes. This method was developed specifically for application to solution NMR. The goal was to reduce the deleterious effect that the unpaired electron spin of the paramagnetic iron has on resonances for nearby amino acids and thus facilitate NMR studies. However, it has the potential for broad application in mechanistic studies and other structural and functional investigations. Initial trials reconfirmed that protoporphyrin extraction and reconstitution was not a feasible approach for substituting the prosthetic group in membrane P450 enzymes due to excessive precipitation of apo-P450 polypeptide and poor reincorporation of even the native FePPIX. To develop a method for inserting PPIX containing different metals during de novo P450 synthesis, the first step was to determine whether membrane P450 enzymes could be produced in suitable yields in minimal medium with PPIX uptake from the medium. Like many membrane proteins, human cytochrome P450 enzymes are notable for low recombinant expression even in rich medium, often Terrific Broth, but growth in minimal medium is necessary to limit the availability of iron and minimize endogenous bacterial FePPIX biosynthesis. To facilitate polypeptide folding, the GroEL/ES chaperone was coexpressed from a second plasmid with distinct antibiotic resistance and induction systems. This approach is frequently useful in increasing P450 protein yields even in rich medium, so its inclusion in minimal medium where lower yields were expected seemed logical. Additionally, because PPIX is not normally taken up into laboratory E. coli strains, a heme uptake system consisting of four additional proteins (hugA, tonB, exbBD, and hugBCD) from Plesiomonas shigelloides (11Graves P.E. Henderson D.P. Horstman M.J. Solomon B.J. Olson J.S. Enhancing stability and expression of recombinant human hemoglobin in E. coli: progress in the development of a recombinant HBOC source.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784 (18489914): 1471-147910.1016/j.bbapap.2008.04.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was coexpressed. Induction of the heme uptake genes by the addition of an iron chelator further helped reduce adventitious iron. Thus, the method developed herein required E. coli to express the membrane P450 plus two chaperone proteins and four heme uptake proteins, while under selection with three different antibiotics, in iron-limited minimal medium (Fig. 1A). Initial trials were conducted for steroidogenic CYP21A2 and CYP17A1 and the drug-metabolizing CYP3A4 proteins in iron-depleted minimal medium supplemented with exogenous FePPIX. This was done to test not only PPIX uptake into cells, incorporation into P450, and the holoprotein yield, but also to permit determination of the catalytic activity of the resulting protein compared with a typical expression protocol involving endogenous bacterial FePPIX synthesis from the heme precursor δ-aminolevulinic acid, which is cell-permeable (Fig. 1A). Unsurprisingly, E. coli cells grew very slowly under these conditions. Iron limitation was a significant factor in bacterial growth. As evaluated by the optical density at 600 nm, the growth rate was more than 3 times slower in terms of both the lag and initial exponential phases compared with the growth of E. coli containing the same constructs in iron-supplemented minimal medium. Otherwise, expression proceeded normally. Subsequent purification methods did not require optimization, proceeding with typical detergent extraction of E. coli membranes followed by metal-affinity and cation-exchange chromatography. During purification of proteins generated with exogenous FePPIX, the yields of the various steps were commensurate with parallel purifications of these proteins generated with endogenous FePPIX biosynthesis, without notable differences. For example, although expression levels differ for the various P450 proteins, a typical yield after ion exchange was 30–50% of the protein isolated from the metal-affinity chromatographic step. Following purification, the overall yields of holoprotein for the different membrane P450 enzymes generated in iron-depleted minimal medium with exogenous FePPIX (51, 37, and 6.8 nmol of P450 per liter of culture for CYP3A4, CYP21A2, and CYP17A1, respectively; Table 1) are 7–21% of the typical yields for the respective proteins expressed in Terrific Broth supplemented by δ-aminolevulinic acid (240, 350, and 100 nmol of P450 per liter of culture for CYP3A4, CYP21A1, and CYP17A1, respectively; Table 1).Table 1Quantity and spectral properties of human P450 proteins expressed under different conditionsSoret λmaxTotal P450 from Soret peakASoretaThe absorbance of the Soret peak (heme) to absorbance at 280 nm (total protein) is a relative measure of purity for an individual P450 enzyme./A280P450bThe percentage of P450 from the total of P450 and P420 species in the reduced, carbon monoxide difference spectrum reflects correct heme incorporation.nmnmol/liter culture%CYP3A4 CYP3A4/chaperone expressed in Terrific Broth in the presence of: δ-Aminolevulinic acid/no ligand4162401.5482 CYP3A4/pHug/chaperone expressed in iron-depleted medium in the presence of: FePPIX/no ligand416511.5786CYP21A2 CYP21A1/chaperone expressed in Terrific Broth in the presence of: δ-Aminolevulinic acid/no ligand4193501.254 CYP21A1/pHug/chaperone expressed in iron-depleted medium in the presence of: No PPIX/no ligand4250.830.1712 FePPIX/no ligand418371.0781 FePPIX/progesterone (substrate)419831.1889CYP17A1 CYP17A1/chaperone expressed in Terrific Broth in the presence of: δ-Aminolevulinic acid/no ligand4171000.974 CYP17A1/pHug/chaperone expressed in iron-depleted medium in the presence of: No PPIX/no ligandTracecTrace, trace amounts of protein too little to characterize.TraceTraceTrace FePPIX/no ligand4166.81.2539 FePPIX/progesterone (substrate)416231.2875 FePPIX/abiraterone (inhibitor)421961.22100 CoPPIX/abiraterone (inhibitor)4281171.54No peak GaPPIX/abiraterone (inhibitor)dThe CYP17A1 enzyme used was the A105L mutant, which has higher yields to help generate enough sample for NMR experiments.421, 4383001.7No peak InPPIX/abiraterone (inhibitor)dThe CYP17A1 enzyme used was the A105L mutant, which has higher yields to help generate enough sample for NMR experiments.431511.2190 CuPPIX/abiraterone (inhibitor)dThe CYP17A1 enzyme used was the A105L mutant, which has higher yields to help generate enough sample for NMR experiments.422401.04100 ZnPPIX/abiraterone (inhibitor)dThe CYP17A1 enzyme used was the A105L mutant, which has higher yields to help generate enough sample for NMR experiments.4261081.4100 AgPPIX/abiraterone (inhibitor)dThe CYP17A1 enzyme used was the A105L mutant, which has higher yields to help generate enough sample for NMR experiments.426181.05100a The absorbance of the Soret peak (heme) to absorbance at 280 nm (total protein) is a relative measure of purity for an individual P450 enzyme.b The percentage of P450 from the total of P450 and P420 species in the reduced, carbon monoxide difference spectrum reflects correct heme incorporation.c Trace, trace amounts of protein too little to characterize.d The CYP17A1 enzyme used was the A105L mutant, which has higher yields to help generate enough sample for NMR experiments. Open table in a new tab To evaluate background levels of iron and possible endogenous FePPIX biosynthesis in iron-limited medium, the CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 were expressed under these iron-depleted conditions without FePPIX supplementation. This also resulted in very slow growth. The resulting protein was ≤2% of the yield compared with when exogenous FePPIX was supplied, was of very low purity, and had an unusual Soret peak for CYP21A2 (Table 1 and Fig. S1). This suggests that although trace amounts of iron may sometimes be present, the majority of the FePPIX-containing P450 protein was derived from supplemented FePPIX successfully imported from the medium into E. coli cells by the proteins of the heme utilization genes. Of course, some trace iron and/or FePPIX would be necessary to support the generation of essential bacterial respiratory proteins, catalases, peroxidases, and other heme-requiring proteins, so it is probably not beneficial to further limit iron sources. In addition, the current intended application of metal-substituted P450 enzymes is solution NMR, which would not be negatively affected by small amounts of P450 protein with FePPIX incorporation. The quality of P450 proteins generated from exogenous FePPIX addition to the medium was compared with that of proteins generated by endogenous FePPIX synthesis. The latter is supported by the addition of cell-permeable, δ-aminolevulinic acid heme precursor to Terrific Broth medium just before P450 induction (Fig. 1A). Observations of metal incorporation and environment are facilitated by the electronic properties of PPIX, resulting in the Soret absorbance peak. The Soret peak shifts with changes in ligand binding to the metal, the identity of the metal, and the metal oxidation state. Endogenous FePPIX biosynthesis and expression of each of these P450 proteins typically result in a Soret peak at 417–418 nm (Table 1; shown for CYP3A4 only in Fig. 1B, left spectrum), consistent with water coordinated to the heme iron opposite the proximal Cys thiolate. The Soret peak for all three P450 enzymes expressed with exogenous FePPIX was located at 416–418 nm (Fig. 1 (C–E), left spectra). The ratio of the Soret absorbance maximum to absorbance at 280 nm is a relative measure of heme incorporation and purity for a specific P450 enzyme. These values for CYP3A4, CYP17A1, and CYP21A2 expressed with exogenous FePPIX (A416–418/A280 = 1.07–1.57) were similar to the purity for the same proteins generated using endogenous FePPIX synthesis (A416–418/A280 = 0.9–1.54; Table 1). A second characteristic of a thiolate-coordinated heme iron is a peak at ∼450 nm for the reduced-carbon monoxide difference spectrum. This indicates that the iron of FePPIX is appropriately bonded to its proximal Cys thiolate. Observation of a peak at 420 nm after reduction and binding of carbon monoxide is instead consistent with incorrect interaction of the heme iron with the proximal polypeptide, proposed to be either the protonated thiol (12Martinis S.A.

This “P420” peak is a sensitive feature easily induced by many different environmental conditions and can often be readily observed to some extent for different P450 enzymes even under optimal expression conditions. When produced with endogenous FePPIX biosynthesis, typical percentages of P450 species for CYP3A4, CYP21A2, and CYP17A1 in the absence of ligand are 82% (Fig. 1B, right spectrum), 54%, and 74%, respectively. By comparison, the same enzymes generated with exogenous FePPIX supplementation demonstrated 86, 81, and 39% P450, respectively (Fig. 1 (C–E) and Table 1). Because the presence of a ligand often stabilizes membrane P450 enzymes against P420 formation, the P450 enzymes with suboptimal amounts (>15%) of P420 (CYP21A2 and CYP17A1) were generated with the exogenous FePPIX system described above, but with the addition of their substrate progesterone during expression but not purification. The result was an increase in both protein quantity and quality. The Soret peak of the purified proteins indicated that the progesterone substrate had washed out during purification because the wavelength was consistent with water coordination to the heme (416 and 419 nm; Fig. 1 (F and G), left spectra). However, the presence of the ligand progesterone during expression resulted in a 2–3-fold increase in purified protein yield (Table 1) with similar purity as measured by the ratio of the Soret peak to the A280 for both proteins (Table 1). Even more importantly, the integrity of heme incorporation as measured by the reduced-carbon monoxide difference spectrum was increased from 81 to 89% for CYP21A1 and from 39 to 75% for CYP17A1 (Table 1 and Fig. 1 (F and G), right spectra). Finally, to further validate the general methodology, the catalytic activities of P450 enzymes expressed with exogenous FePPIX supplementation were compared with the same protein expressed with endogenous FePPIX biosynthesis. In each case, no ligand was included during expression or purification. CYP3A4 oxidation of luciferin-IPA proceeded similarly regardless of heme source (Fig. 2A and Table 2). Progesterone is a natural substrate for both CYP17A1 and CYP21A2, which perform hydroxylation at C17 and C21, respectively. Similar to CYP3A4, progesterone 21-hydroxylation by CYP21A2 generated with exogenous FePPIX yielded both Km and kcat values similar to that of CYP21A2 expressed with endogenous FePPIX biosynthesis (Fig. 2B and Table 2), and adding progesterone during expression did not significantly change the kinetic constants (Table 2). However, progesterone 17α-hydroxylation by CYP17A1 produced with exogenous FePPIX yielded a similar Km but lower kcat compared with CYP17A1 expressed with endogenous FePPIX synthesis (Fig. 2C and Table 2). In this case, adding progesterone during CYP17A1 expression with exogenous FePPIX supplementation resulted in a kcat more similar to CYP17A1 generated with endogenous FePPIX biosynthesis (Table 2).Table 2Comparison of kinetic constants for CYP3A4, CYP21A2, and CYP17A1 expressed with either bacterial endogenous FePPIX biosynthesis or the addition of exogenous FePPIX and heme uptake geneskcata#, p < 0.05; ##, p < 0.01 compared with the Km and kcat of the same enzyme expressed with endogenous FePPIX biosynthesis.Kmkcat /Kmmin−1mmmin−1 mm−1CYP3A4 expressed with: Endogenous FePPIX0.0064 ± 0.00025.2 ± 0.60.0012 Exogenous FePPIX0.0074 ± 0.0004#4.7 ± 0.70.0015CYP21A2 expressed with: Endogenous FePPIX20 ± 13.2 ± 0.76.2 Exogenous FePPIX19 ± 12.8 ± 0.66.9 Endogenous FePPIX/progesterone20 ± 12.8 ± 0.77.2 Exogenous FePPIX/progesterone20 ± 12.9 ± 0.76.7CYP17A1 expressed with: Endogenous FePPIX2.9 ± 0.72.5 ± 0.31.1 Exogenous FePPIX1.3 ± 0.4##2.5 ± 0.30.50 Endogenous FePPIX/progesterone3.1 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.41.4 Exogenous FePPIX/progesterone1.8 ± 0.1##2.9 ± 0.60.63a #, p < 0.05; ##, p < 0.01 compared with the Km and kcat of the same enzyme expressed with endogenous FePPIX biosynthesis. Open table in a new tab These results are consistent with different degrees of intrinsic stability for the different P450 enzymes generated either with endogenous FePPIX biosynthesis or with exogenousFePPIX supplementation. CYP3A4 did not require the presence of a ligand to yield a P450 spectrum similar to that with exogenous FePPIX biosynthesis. The addition of the substrate progesterone during expression improved the percentage of P450 for CYP21A2 to almost 90%. In contrast, although the addition of the substrate progesterone improved the percentage of P450 from 39 to 70% for CYP17A1, this was not sufficient to bring it to >85%, which was the target for structural studies. The progesterone substrate added to CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 increased the yield during expression with exogenous FePPIX, but was subsequently washed out during purification. To further facilitate CYP17A1 stabilization, the inhibitor and prostate cancer drug abiraterone was used instead of the substrate progesterone because abiraterone binds more tightly (17DeVore N.M. Scott E.E. Structures of cytochrome P450 17A1 with prostate cancer drugs abiraterone and TOK-001.Nature. 2012; 482 (22266943): 116-11910.1038/nature10743Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We previously established that abiraterone binds CYP17A1 with nanomolar affinity via coordination of its nitrogen heteroatom directly to the heme iron, as indicated by a red shift of the Soret peak and verified by the X-ray structure (17DeVore N.M. Scott E.E. Structures of cytochrome P450 17A1 with prostate cancer drugs abiraterone and TOK-001.Nature. 2012; 482 (22266943): 116-11910.1038/nature10743Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The presence of abiraterone during expression with exogenous FePPIX, but not during purification, yielded purified CYP17A1, which retained the abiraterone inhibitor, as indicated by the Soret maximum at 421 nm (Fig. 1H, left spectrum). In addition, compared with expression with progesterone, expression with abiraterone resulted in a ∼4-fold higher yield after purification with similar purity and 100% P450 (Fig. 1H, right). CYP17A1 is potently inhibited by the abiraterone inhibitor, which does not readily dissociate, so enzymatic activity could not be determined. However, solution NMR was used to identify any structural changes. Unlike CYP21A2 and CYP3A4, which are oligomers and too large for traditional solution NMR, CYP17A1 is monomeric, and its 55-kDa molecular mass is just small enough to yield a reasonable 2D 1H-15N spectrum. NMR is a highly sensitive, high-resolution approach that can readily be used to determine the similarities and differences between two versions of a protein, even without knowing the identity of the individual assignments. Thus, NMR permits evaluation of the entire CYP17A1 structure under different conditions, even if the spectrum is crowded by >500 amino acid resonances. For this purpose, CYP17A1 was generated in the presence of the abiraterone inhibitor with either exogenous PPIX supplementation or endogenous PPIX biosynthesis while substituting 15N-ammonium chloride for the unlabeled ammonium chloride in the minimal medium. The 2D 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC spectra revealed that 15N-CYP17A1 generated with exogenous FePPIX supplementation and endogenous FePPIX biosynthesis have a very similar overall distribution of resonances (Fig. 3A). This high similarity indicates very similar folds in both proteins with no major structural differences.Figure 3Overlay of 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC spectra of CYP17A1 expressed under various conditions.

Thus, the general methodology for getting exogenous PPIX into cells and incorporated into these quasi-stable membrane proteins was validated.

https://openalex.org/W2891871042,"Construction and demolition (C&D) waste is a novel, widespread environmental stress that negatively affects environment, organisms and ecosystem. Yet effects of cumulative consequences of C&D waste on the fitness and community structure of most underground insects remain unclear. With relatively sessile life underground lasting several years, cicadas can be an important aspect in forest nutrient cycles. Whether cicada nymphs are easily affected by C&D waste, and whether they have evolved any adaptations to cope with the adverse environments merit exploration. Here, we investigated the biodiversity, community structure, population dynamics and morphology of cicada nymphs in both uncontaminated and contaminated habitats by C&D waste in Guanzhong Plain, China since 2011. In total, 1,573 cicada nymphs were collected from 2011 to 2015, including 62 malformed nymphs. The malformed nymphs can be divided into three types: physically damaged individuals (still alive) (3.2%), fungus-infected individuals (dead) (64.5%), and bacterium-infected individuals (dead) (32.3%). The proportion of malformed nymphs increased year by year in the habitats contaminated by C&D waste. In the uncontaminated habitats, although no significant differences of population density among the investigated years were observed, yet there was a distinct increasing trend of population of Meimuna mongolica, whereas populations of both Cryptotympana atrata and Platypleura kaempferi distinctly decreased. This indicates that M. mongolica is possibly evolving into the most dominant species in the ecological niche when it competes with other sympatric species, but more researches are needed to establish whether there is a shift in the species composition of cicadas. In the habitats contaminated by C&D waste, a higher ratio of malformed individuals and a decline of population of both M. mongolica and C. atrata were revealed; P. kaempferi was not found in the contaminated habitats, indicating a weaker resistance of this species against C&D waste. The negative responses of cicada nymphs to C&D waste have significant implications for the habitat destruction. Cicada nymphs may be suitable bioindicators for underground-habitat-quality monitoring, as merits further research to reveal the association between the magnitude of C&D waste contamination with the fitness and population dynamics of cicada nymphs."
https://openalex.org/W2892313207,"Factor H (FH) is the major regulator of C3b in the alternative pathway of the complement system in immunity. FH comprises 20 short complement regulator (SCR) domains, including eight glycans, and its Y402H polymorphism predisposes those who carry it to age-related macular degeneration. To better understand FH complement binding and self-association, we have studied the solution structures of both the His-402 and Tyr-402 FH allotypes. Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that up to 12% of both FH allotypes self-associate, and this was confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), MS, and surface plasmon resonance analyses. SAXS showed that monomeric FH has a radius of gyration (Rg) of 7.2–7.8 nm and a length of 25 nm. Starting from known structures for the SCR domains and glycans, the SAXS data were fitted using Monte Carlo methods to determine atomistic structures of monomeric FH. The analysis of 29,715 physically realistic but randomized FH conformations resulted in 100 similar best-fit FH structures for each allotype. Two distinct molecular structures resulted that showed either an extended N-terminal domain arrangement with a folded-back C terminus or an extended C terminus and a folded-back N terminus. These two structures are the most accurate to date for glycosylated full-length FH. To clarify FH functional roles in host protection, crystal structures for the FH complexes with C3b and C3dg revealed that the extended N-terminal conformation accounted for C3b fluid-phase regulation, the extended C-terminal conformation accounted for C3d binding, and both conformations accounted for bivalent FH binding to glycosaminoglycans on the target cell surface."

We previously reported that it displayed antibiofilm activities against P. aeruginosa. The goal of this study was to determine whether (1) the antibiofilm property is broad (including S. aureus, another prevalent organism in cystic fibrosis); (2) the α4 region is responsible for such activity; and (3), if so, this motif could be structurally optimized as an antimicrobial peptide with enhanced activities. We used S. aureus biofilm-prevention assays to determine bacterial biomass in the presence of SPLUNC1 and SPLUNC1Δα4 recombinant proteins, or SPLUNC1-derived peptides (α4 and α4M1), using the well-established crystal-violet biofilm detection assay. The SPLUNC1Δα4 showed markedly reduced biofilm prevention compared to the parent protein. Surprisingly, the 30-residue long α4 motif alone demonstrated minimal biofilm prevention activities. However, structural optimization of the α4 motif resulted in a modified peptide (α4M1) with significantly enhanced antibiofilm properties against methicillin–sensitive (MSSA) and–resistant (MRSA) S. aureus, including six different clinical strains of MRSA and the well-known USA300. Hemolytic activity was undetectable at up to 100μM for the peptides.

However, full clinical integration of biomarkers has been met with challenges, partly attributed to analytical difficulties. It has been shown that biomarker reproducibility is susceptible to data preprocessing approaches. Here, we systematically evaluated machine-learning ensembles of preprocessing methods as a general strategy to improve biomarker performance for prediction of survival from early breast cancer. Results We risk stratified breast cancer patients into either low-risk or high-risk groups based on four published hypoxia signatures (Buffa, Winter, Hu, and Sorensen), using 24 different preprocessing approaches for microarray normalization. The 24 binary risk profiles determined for each hypoxia signature were combined using a random forest to evaluate the efficacy of a preprocessing ensemble classifier. We demonstrate that the best way of merging preprocessing methods varies from signature to signature, and that there is likely no ‘best’ preprocessing pipeline that is universal across datasets, highlighting the need to evaluate ensembles of preprocessing algorithms. Further, we developed novel signatures for each preprocessing method and the risk classifications from each were incorporated in a meta-random forest model. Interestingly, the classification of these biomarkers and its ensemble show striking consistency, demonstrating that similar intrinsic biological information are being faithfully represented. As such, these classification patterns further confirm that there is a subset of patients whose prognosis is consistently challenging to predict. Conclusions Performance of different prognostic signatures varies with pre-processing method. A simple classifier by unanimous voting of classifications is a reliable way of improving on single preprocessing methods. Future signatures will likely require integration of intrinsic and extrinsic clinico-pathological variables to better predict disease-related outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2891725459,"Introduction:
Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) is increasingly investigated as a means to assess liver quality, but data on viability markers is inconsistent and the effects of different perfusion routes and oxygenation on perfusion biomarkers are unclear.

Methods:
This is a single-centre, randomised, multi-arm, parallel study using discarded human livers for evaluation of HMP using arterial, oxygen-supplemented venous and non-oxygen-supplemented venous perfusion. The study included 2 stages: in the first stage, 25 livers were randomised into static cold storage (n = 7), hepatic artery HMP (n = 10), and non-oxygen-supplemented portal vein HMP (n = 8). In the second stage, 20 livers were randomised into oxygen-supplemented and non-oxygen-supplemented portal vein HMP (n = 11 and 9, respectively). Changes in dynamic, biochemical, and morphologic parameters during 4-hour preservation were compared between perfusion groups, and between potentially transplantable and non-transplantable livers.

Results:
During arterial perfusion, resistance was higher and flow was lower than venous perfusion (p = 0.001 and 0.01, respectively); this was associated with higher perfusate markers during arterial perfusion (p>0.05). Supplementary oxygen did not cause a significant alteration in the studied parameters. Morphology was similar between static and dynamic preservation groups. Perfusate markers were 2 fold higher in non-transplantable livers (p>0.05).

Conclusions:
Arterial only perfusion might not be adequate for graft perfusion. Hepatocellular injury markers are accessible and easy to perform and could offer insight into graft quality, but large randomised trials are needed to identify reliable quality assessment biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2889592669,"After discrimination learning between two stimuli that lie on a continuum, animals typically exhibit generalization on the basis of similarity to the physical features of the stimuli, often producing a peak-shifted gradient. However, post-discrimination generalization in humans usually resembles a monotonically increasing (e.g., linear) gradient that is better characterized as following a relational rule describing the difference between the stimuli. The current study tested whether rule-based generalization could be disrupted by reducing the applicability of a relational rule on test. We compared generalization following a difficult categorization task between a group who could use their rule consistently throughout test (Group Consistent), and a group who could only apply their rule effectively on 50% of test trials and thus could only use it inconsistently (Group Inconsistent). Across two experiments, a peak shift was found in the Inconsistent group and a monotonic gradient in the Consistent group. A post-hoc sequential analysis revealed that the Inconsistent group produced both peak-shifted and monotonic gradients as a function of whether or not the relevant rule was applicable on the previous trial. Reducing the applicability of a rule on test thus appeared to lead participants to revert to generalizing on the basis of similarity. Our results suggest that humans learn about the physical features of the stimuli alongside relational rules, and that rule- and similarity-based learning can interact in determining generalization."

Here we investigated the regulation of the mTORC2 binding partner mammalian stress-activated protein kinase-interacting protein 1 (mSin1) in MCs derived from human lung allografts and identified a novel role for mSin1 during fibrosis. mSin1 was identified as a common downstream target of key fibrotic pathways, and its expression was increased in MCs in response to pro-fibrotic mediators: lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), transforming growth factor β, and interleukin 13. Fibrotic MCs had higher mSin1 protein levels than nonfibrotic MCs, and siRNA-mediated silencing of mSIN1 inhibited collagen I expression and mTORC1/2 activity in these cells. Autocrine LPA signaling contributed to constitutive up-regulation of mSin1 in fibrotic MCs, and mSin1 was decreased because of LPA receptor 1 siRNA treatment. We identified c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) as a key intermediary in mSin1 up-regulation by the pro-fibrotic mediators, as pharmacological and siRNA-mediated inhibition of JNK prevented the LPA-induced mSin1 increase. Proteasomal inhibition rescued mSin1 levels after JNK inhibition in LPA-treated MCs, and the decrease in mSin1 ubiquitination in response to LPA was counteracted by JNK inhibitors. Constitutive JNK1 overexpression induced mSin1 expression and could drive mTORC2 and mTORC1 activation and collagen I expression in nonfibrotic MCs, effects that were reversed by siRNA-mediated mSIN1 silencing. These results indicate that LPA stabilizes mSin1 protein expression via JNK signaling by blocking its proteasomal degradation and identify the LPA/JNK/mSin1/mTORC/collagen I pathway as critical for fibrotic activation of MCs."

In the current study, we characterized two circular RNAs that had been identified through NGS-based 5'RACE experiments. According to the results, the Peg3 locus contains a 214-nucleotide-long circular RNA, circPeg3, that is detected in low abundance from the neonatal brain, lung and ovary. In contrast, the Igf2r locus contains a group of highly abundant circular RNAs, circIgf2r, showing multiple forms with various exon combinations. In both cases, the expression patterns of circPeg3 and circIgf2r among individual tissues are quite different from their linear mRNA counterparts. This suggests potential unique roles played by the identified circular RNAs. Overall, this study reports the identification of novel circular RNAs specific to mammalian imprinted loci, suggesting that circular RNAs are likely involved in the function and regulation of imprinted genes."
https://openalex.org/W2891837417,"The Thoroughbred horse breed was developed primarily for racing, and has a significant contribution to the qualitative improvement of many other horse breeds. Despite the importance of Thoroughbred racehorses in historical, cultural, and economical viewpoints, there was no temporal and spatial dynamics of them using the mitogenome sequences. To explore this topic, the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of 14 Thoroughbreds and two Przewalski’s horses were determined. These sequences were analyzed together along with 151 previously published horse mitochondrial genomes from a range of breeds across the globe using a Bayesian coalescent approach as well as Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods. The racing horses were revealed to have multiple maternal origins and to be closely related to horses from one Asian, two Middle Eastern, and five European breeds. Thoroughbred horse breed was not directly related to the Przewalski’s horse which has been regarded as the closest taxon to the all domestic horses and the only true wild horse species left in the world. Our phylogenomic analyses also supported that there was no apparent correlation between geographic origin or breed and the evolution of global horses. The most recent common ancestor of the Thoroughbreds lived approximately 8,100–111,500 years ago, which was significantly younger than the most recent common ancestor of modern horses (0.7286 My). Bayesian skyline plot revealed that the population expansion of modern horses, including Thoroughbreds, occurred approximately 5,500–11,000 years ago, which coincide with the start of domestication. This is the first phylogenomic study on the Thoroughbred racehorse in association with its spatio-temporal dynamics. The database and genetic history information of Thoroughbred mitogenomes obtained from the present study provide useful information for future horse improvement projects, as well as for the study of horse genomics, conservation, and in association with its geographical distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2890401087,"Low-energy fractures are a growing health challenge as their incidence increases with advancing age. As cardiovascular instability may be associated with higher likelihood of traumatic falls, we aimed to investigate the associations between four cardiovascular biomarkers and the risk of low-energy fractures in a middle-aged population.A total of 5291 individuals from the prospective Malmö Diet and Cancer (MDC) study (mean age, 57 years; 59% women) with data on baseline levels of four cardiovascular biomarkers: mid-regional-fragment of pro-adrenomedullin-peptide (MR-pro-ADM), mid-regional-fragment of pro-atrial-natriuretic-peptide (MR-proANP), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) and C-terminal-pro-arginine-vasopressin (CT-pro-AVP/Copeptin) were included. The associations between biomarker levels and first incident low-energy fracture were tested in Cox proportional-hazard models, taking potential interactions and traditional risk factors into account.Participants were followed for a median time of 21.0 years, during which 1002 subjects (19%) experienced at least one low-energy fracture. Subjects with incident fracture were older, more likely to be women, had lower BMI and higher prevalence of previous fractures. Among biomarkers, there was a significant interaction between gender and MR-pro-ADM on the risk of fracture (p = 0.002). MR-pro-ADM predicted fractures in men only (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI 1.09-1.40; p = 0.001), whereas there was no association among women. Levels of MR-pro-ANP, NT-pro-BNP and CT-pro-AVP did not predict fractures.Higher circulating levels of MR-pro-ADM predict low-energy fractures among middle-aged-men, whereas levels of MR-pro-ANP, NT-pro-BNP and CT-pro-AVP are not associated with increased fracture risk. Further controlled studies should test the hypothesis whether MR-pro-ADM may improve prediction of bone fractures."
https://openalex.org/W2891656880,"Background To investigate the association between unrecognized myocardial infarction (UMI) assessed with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and coronary artery calcium (CAC) and cardiovascular risk prediction scores in asymptomatic Asian subjects. Materials and methods Total 872 asymptomatic subjects without prior cardiovascular event (male:female, 817:55; age, 53.88 ± 5.91) who underwent both CMR and CAC scoring CT were included. UMI were accessed and framingham risk score (FRS) and ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) risk score by ACC/AHA were calculated. Results Late gadolinium enhancement indicating UMI was noted in 23 of 872 subjects (2.64%), but only three of them showed ECG abnormality (13.04%). Subjects with UMI showed higher CAC scores, FRS, and ASCVD scores than those without UMI (p < .001, p = .011 and p = .024, respectively). The prevalence of UMI differed significantly according to the CAC scores as follows: 1% in CAC = 0 (4/403), 1% in 1 ≤ CAC <100 (2/293), 6.1% in 100 ≤ CAC < 400 (7/114) and 14.5% in CAC ≥ 400 (9/62), respectively (p < .001). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis by using CAC score demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.816 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.780–0.848; p < .0001) for predicting UMI, which is superior to FRS [AUC, 0.712; 95% CI, 0.671–0.751; p = .009] and ASCVD risk score [AUC, 0.689; 95% CI, 0.648–0.729; p = .036]. Conclusion The prevalence of UMI increases with increasing burden of CAC and FRS. CAC score is a good discriminator for UMI, superior to FRS and ASCVD score, in asymptomatic population."
https://openalex.org/W2892061125,"Self-administered treatment (SAT), a differentiated model of care for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB), might address adherence challenges faced by patients and health care systems. This study explored patient, health-care worker (HCW) and community care worker (CCW) perspectives on a SAT pilot programme in South Africa, in which patients were given medication to take at home with the optional support of a CCW.We conducted a mixed-methods study from July 2016-June 2017. The quantitative component included semi-structured questionnaires with patients, HCWs and CCWs; the qualitative component involved in-depth interviews with patients enrolled in the pilot programme. Interviews were conducted in isiXhosa, translated, transcribed and manually coded.Overall, 27 patients, 12 HCWs and 44 CCWs were enrolled in the quantitative component; nine patients were also interviewed. Of the 27 patients who completed semi-structured questionnaires, 22 were HIV-infected and 17 received a monthly supply of RR TB treatment. Most HCWs and CCWs (10 and 32, respectively) understood the pilot programme; approximately half (n = 14) of the patients could not correctly describe the pilot programme. Overall, 11 and 41 HCWs and CCWs reported that the pilot programme promoted treatment adherence. Additionally, 11 HCWs reported that the pilot programme relieved pressure on the clinic. Key qualitative findings highlighted the importance of a support person and how the flexibility of SAT enabled integration of treatment into their daily routines and reduced time spent in clinics. The pilot programme was also perceived to allow patients more autonomy and made it easier for them to manage side-effects.The SAT pilot programme was acceptable from the perspective of patients, HCWs and CCWs and should be considered as a differentiated model of care for RR-TB, particularly in settings with high burdens of HIV, in order to ease management of treatment for patients and health-care providers."
