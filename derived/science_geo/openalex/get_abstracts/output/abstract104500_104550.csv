https://openalex.org/W2012397093,"A novel Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>) has recently been purified from the murine macrophage-like cell line P388D<sub>1</sub> (Ackermann, E. J., Kempner, E. S., and Dennis, E. A.(1994) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 269, 9227-9233). This enzyme is now shown to be inhibited by palmitoyl trifluoromethyl ketone (PACOCF<sub>3</sub>), arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF<sub>3</sub>), and a bromoenol lactone (BEL). Both PACOCF<sub>3</sub> and AACOCF<sub>3</sub> were found to inhibit the macrophage PLA<sub>2</sub> in a concentration-dependent manner. PACOCF<sub>3</sub> was found to be ~4-fold more potent than AACOCF<sub>3</sub>, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.8 μM (0.0075 mol fraction) and 15 μM (0.028 mol fraction), respectively. Reaction progress curves in the presence of either inhibitor were found to be linear, and the PACOCF<sub>3</sub>•PLA<sub>2</sub> complex rapidly dissociated upon dilution. BEL was also found to inhibit the macrophage PLA<sub>2</sub> in a concentration-dependent manner, with half-maximal inhibition observed at 60 nM after a 5-min preincubation at 40°C. Inhibition was not reversed after extensive dilution of the enzyme into assay buffer. Treatment of the PLA<sub>2</sub> with BEL resulted in a linear, time-dependent inactivation of activity, and the rate of this inactivation was diminished in the presence of PACOCF<sub>3</sub>. In addition, PLA<sub>2</sub> treated with [<sup>3</sup>H]BEL resulted in the covalent labeling of a major band at <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> 80,000. Inactivation of the PLA<sub>2</sub> by 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) prior to treatment with [<sup>3</sup>H]BEL resulted in the near complete lack of labeling consistent with covalent irreversible suicide inhibition of the enzyme. The labeling of a <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> 80,000 band rather than a <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> 40,000 band upon treatment with [<sup>3</sup>H]BEL distinguishes the macrophage Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent PLA<sub>2</sub> from a previously identified myocardial Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent PLA<sub>2</sub> and provides strong evidence that the <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> 80,000 protein is the catalytic subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1898357572,"A large panel of human CD4+ T helper (Th) cell clones with established Th1, Th2, or Th0 profiles of cytokine secretion were examined for the expression of CD30, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Th1 clones expressed poor or no CD30 mRNA, and showed low or undetectable expression of both membrane and soluble CD30 (sCD30) protein, whereas Th2 clones showed both CD30 mRNA and membrane CD30 and released substantial amounts of sCD30. Th0 clones exhibited an intermediate pattern of CD30 expression and release. When T cells from the same donor were stimulated with three different antigens (purified protein derivative, PPD; Toxocara canis excretory/secretory antigen, TES; Lolium perenne group I, Lol p I), production of high concentrations of IFN-gamma, but not expression of CD30 or production of IL-4 and IL-5, were observed at any time after stimulation with PPD. In contrast, both CD30 expression and production of IL-4 and IL-5, but not of IFN-gamma, were concomitantly detectable in TES- and Lol p I-reactive T cells, suggesting a temporal relationship between CD30 expression and beginning of Th2-type cytokine production. Finally, CD4+CD30+ T cells specific for Lol p I and inducible to production of Th2-type cytokines were sorted out from the circulation of grass-sensitive patients in concomitance with the onset of allergic symptoms during the seasonal exposure to grass pollen. Thus, CD30 expression appears to be associated with the differentiation/activation pathway of human T cells producing Th2-type cytokines."

https://openalex.org/W2051729351,"Antibodies to DNA and nucleoproteins are found in sera of individuals with systemic autoimmune disease. In the population (and in the autoimmune mouse strain MRL/lpr) there is a great variety of such antinuclear antibodies, but individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus or single MRL mice express a subset only of the antinuclear specificities found in the population. These observations have been interpreted to mean that these antibodies arise by immunization. The oligoclonal nature of the autoantibody response and the evidence of selection acting on somatically mutated autoantibodies favour this interpretation. Specific activation of autoantibodies in disease implies either that autoantibodies are regulated in non-diseased individuals or that autoantigen availability is variable. The former has been demonstrated in anti-DNA transgenic mice. In normal mice, transgene-encoded antibodies against double-stranded (ds) DNA are not expressed in serum or on B cells. Here we describe modified anti-dsDNA transgenic mice which allow us to study the site and developmental stage at which such B-cell regulation occurs. This model shows that in normal mice B cells expressing anti-DNA specificity are deleted in the bone marrow at a pre-B to immature B transitional stage."

https://openalex.org/W1517594377,"The successful identification of the residues that contact ligand has important implications, especially in view of the increasing use of antibodies in various medical and industrial applications. Analysis of the crystallographically derived, three-dimensional structures of five antibody-antigen complexes and of the available amino acid sequence data on antibody variable regions reveals that the residues that contact antigen are in the main also the most variable. It is proposed that a good first guess of the identity of the specificity-determining residues can be made from an examination of the variability values at sequence positions. New boundaries for the complementarity-determining regions are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1986381441,"Insulin causes rapid insulin receptor autophosphorylation, receptor endocytosis, and phosphorylation of its principle substrate (IRS-1). Using rat adipocytes, we studied the dynamics of receptor autophosphorylation, the kinase activity, and the IRS-1 phosphorylation state relative to the subcellular localization of these proteins. After 2 min of insulin exposure, the specific phosphotyrosine content of the insulin receptor in the internal membranes (IM) peaks at a level 5-6-fold higher than the plasma membrane (PM) receptor and then declines after 5-8 min to a level similar to the PM receptor. The exogenous kinase activity of these receptors exactly mirrored their phosphotyrosine content. The distribution of IRS-1 is 80% cytosolic, 20% IM-associated, and essentially undetectable in the PM. The phosphorylation state of IRS-1 in the IM parallels that of the insulin receptor, but cytosolic IRS-1 phosphorylation remains constant. Insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation to the PM occurs after the peak of IRS-1 phosphorylation. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that insulin action may be mediated by receptor internalization and interaction with its substrate(s) associated with internal membranes. A small fraction of phosphorylated insulin receptors is sufficient for signal transduction. The dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 in the IM appears to be a concerted process, possibly mediated by the same enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2089509586,"Previous studies have shown that hepsin is a putative membrane-associated serine protease that is required for cell growth (Torres-Rosado, A., O'Shea, K. S., Tsuji, A., Chou, S.-H., and Kurachi, K.(1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 7181 7185). In the present study, we have transfected baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells with a plasmid containing the cDNA for human hepsin and examined these cells for their ability to activate several blood coagulation factors including factors X, IX, VII, prothrombin, and protein C. Little, if any, proteolytic activation of factors X, IX, prothrombin, or protein C was observed when these clotting factors were incubated with hepsin-transfected cells. On the other hand, hepsin-transfected cells proteolytically activated significant concentrations of human factor VII in a time- and calcium-dependent manner, whereas essentially no activation of factor VII was observed in BHK cells transfected with plasmid lacking the cDNA for hepsin. The factor VII activating activity in the hepsin-transfected BHK cell line was confined exclusively to the total membrane fraction and was inhibited >95% by antibody raised against a fusion protein consisting of maltose-binding protein and the extracellular domain of human hepsin. An active site factor VII mutant, S344A factor VII, was cleaved as readily as plasma-derived factor VII by hepsin-transfected cells, indicating that factor VII was not converted to factor VIIa autocatalytically on the cell surface. In contrast, an activation cleavage site factor VII mutant, R152E factor VII, was not cleaved by hepsin-transfected cells, suggesting that factor VII and S344A factor VII were activated on these cells by cleavage of the Arg152-Ile153 peptide bond. In the copresence of factor VII and factor X, hepsin-transfected BHK cells supported the formation of factor Xa. In addition, in the copresence of factor VII, factor X, and prothrombin, hepsin-transfected BHK cells supported the formation of thrombin. These results strongly suggest that membrane-associated hepsin converts zymogen factor VII to factor VIIa, which in turn, is capable of initiating a coagulation pathway on the cell surface that ultimately leads to thrombin formation. Previous studies have shown that hepsin is a putative membrane-associated serine protease that is required for cell growth (Torres-Rosado, A., O'Shea, K. S., Tsuji, A., Chou, S.-H., and Kurachi, K.(1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 7181 7185).

These results strongly suggest that membrane-associated hepsin converts zymogen factor VII to factor VIIa, which in turn, is capable of initiating a coagulation pathway on the cell surface that ultimately leads to thrombin formation. Considerable clinical and experimental evidence support the view that a variety of neoplastic cells activate the blood coagulation system, leading to hypercoagulability and intravascular thrombosis(1.Murray J.C. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 64: 422-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism whereby tumor cells promote blood coagulation is poorly understood, direct activation of the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation is widely believed to be instrumental in fibrin formation around neoplastic cells. In this regard, several tumor cells synthesize and express cell-surface tissue factor(2.Edwards R.L. Silver J. Rickles F.R. Thrombo. Hemostasis. 1993; 69: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which serves as a cell-surface receptor and cofactor for factor VIIa. The factor VIIa-tissue factor complex then rapidly activates factors IX and X by limited proteolysis(3.Osterud B. Rapaport S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5260-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 4.Bom V.J.J. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 5.Komiyama Y. Pedersen A.H.

Precisely how factor VII is activated in the tumor microenvironment is unclear. In addition, several tumor cells generate thrombin and fibrin without detectable cell-surface tissue factor, and precisely how this happens is unknown although cancer procoagulant A synthesis by these cells has been implicated in this mechanism(7.Costantini V. Zacharski L.R. Thrombo. Hemostasis. 1993; 69: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cell-surface proteases of normal and malignant cells are generally thought to play roles in cell growth, chemotaxis, endocytosis, exocytosis, blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and tissue invasion during metastasis(8.Bond J.S. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 775-780PubMed Google Scholar). Several plasma membrane-associated proteases have been purified and include endopeptidases, metalloproteases, neutral serine proteases, carboxypeptidases, aminopeptidases, and dipeptidases(8.Bond J.S. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 775-780PubMed Google Scholar). A novel zymogen of a trypsin-like serine protease, designated as hepsin, was recently identified by screening a human liver cDNA library with a synthetic oligonucleotide probe coding for a highly conserved amino acid sequence found in the serine protease family(9.Leytus S.P. Loeb K.R. Hagen F.S. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Hepsin ( ∼51 kDa) is composed of an amino-terminal transmembrane domain followed by a potential catalytic domain featuring the active site triad residues of His, Asp, and Ser that participate in enzyme catalysis. It is currently assumed that the transmembrane domain anchors hepsin to the cell membrane and that the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain is extracellular. Hepsin is expressed in high levels in liver tissue but is also expressed at lower levels in other tissues including kidney, pancreas, lung, thyroid, pituitary gland, and testis(10.Tsuji A.

Western blot analyses of solubilized fractions of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) indicated that hepsin is located on the membrane but not in the cytosol or conditioned media of these cells(10.Tsuji A. Torres-Rosado A. Arai T. Beau M.M.L. Lemons R.S. Chou S-H. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16948-16953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise biological role of hepsin is not clear, recent studies by Torres-Rosado and co-workers (11.Torres-Rosado A. O'Shea K.S. Tsuji A. Chou S-H. Kurachi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7181-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) indicate that hepsin may play a significant role in cell growth and maintenance of cell morphology.

We demonstrate herein that the hepsin-transfected BHK cells activate human factor VII by limited proteolytic cleavage of the Arg152-Ile153 peptide bond. Furthermore, in the presence of plasma levels of factor X and prothrombin, newly formed factor VIIa can initiate a pathway that culminates in thrombin formation.

Factor X (1.1 mg/ml) and prothrombin (1.0 mg/ml) preparations contained no detectable factor VII antigen as determined by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (limit of detection ∼0.1 ng/ml). Prior to use, factor VII and factor X preparations were treated with a 500-fold molar excess of EGRck for 2 h at 37°C followed by extensive dialysis at 4°C against Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Prothrombin preparations were also treated with a 50-fold molar excess of 4-amidinophenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and dialyzed against TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mM NaCl) prior to use. Human brain cephalin (mixed phosphopholipids) (25.Bell W.N. Alton H.G.

Hamster brain tissue factor (thromboplastin) was prepared from acetone-dehydrated hamster brain powder by saline extraction at 52°C according to Quick(27.Quick A.J. Hemorrhagic Disease and Thrombosis. Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia, PA1966: 438Google Scholar). Goat anti-rabbit tissue factor IgG was purified by DEAE-AffiGel Blue chromatography and kindly provided by Dr. L. V. M. Rao, University of Texas/Tyler. Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie Blue dye binding assay (28.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) calibrated with bovine serum albumin. A mal E::hepsin gene fusion was constructed as follows. Hepsin cDNA was cleaved with Bsh1236I to generate a 1-kilobase DNA fragment that was purified by gel electrophoresis(29.Vogelstein B. Gillespie B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). This fragment, encoding hepsin residues 80-417, was ligated into vector pMAL-c2 that had previously been cleaved with XmnI and EcoRI, and subsequently treated with calf intestinal phosphatase prior to ligation (30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Epicurian coli® XL-1 Blue supercompetent cells were transformed with ∼50 ng of pMAL-c2/hepsin DNA essentially as outlined by the manufacturer, and 5 μl of the transformation mixture spread on Luria-Bertani (LB)/ampicillin plates. Individual colonies were grown in LB/ampicillin medium and examined for fusion protein synthesis by SDS-PAGE (31.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) following induction with 0.3 mM IPTG. Cells containing plasmids that coded for a MBP/hepsin fusion protein were grown to 5 × 108 cells/ml at 37°C with shaking in LB/glucose/ampicillin for 5 h. IPTG was then added to a final concentration of 0.3 mM, and the culture was incubated with vigorous shaking at 30°C for an additional 5 h. The cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation, resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl/1 mM EDTA (column buffer), and lysed by sonication. Cell debris was removed by high speed centrifugation and the supernatant applied directly to a column of amylose resin (1.6 × 8 cm) previously equilibrated at 4°C with column buffer. Following sample application and wash, the MBP/hepsin fusion protein was eluted from the affinity resin in column buffer containing 10 mM maltose. Examination of the maltose eluent by SDS-PAGE indicated a prominent 84 kDa band (fusion protein) and two minor bands with apparent molecular masses of 67 and 43 kDa that presumably represent degradation products of the fusion protein and endogenously synthesized maltose-binding protein, respectively(32.Guan C.D. Li P. Riggs P.D. Inouye H. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the MBP/hepsin fusion protein were generated in rabbits (33.Dunbar B.S. Schwoebel E.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and the IgG fraction purified by protein A-Sepharose column chromatography. Immunoblot analysis of a total membrane fraction derived from Hepsin-1/BHK cells indicated that the rabbit anti-MBP/hepsin IgG recognized a major protein with an apparent Mr of 55,000 and two minor proteins with Mr values of ∼48,000 and 33,000. A full-length human hepsin cDNA called HepG2UW7 (9.Leytus S.P. Loeb K.R. Hagen F.S. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was ligated into a mammalian cell expression vector called Zem229R(34.Foster D.C. Holly R.D. Sprecher C.A. Walker K.M. Kumar A.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This vector permits insertion of EcoRI or BamHI fragments into a cloning site downstream of the mouse metallothionine promoter and upstream of the SV-40 polyadenylation sequence and also carries an expression unit for the dihydrofolate reductase gene under control of the SV-40 early promoter. BHK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Subconfluent cells were transfected with the hepsin expression plasmid by the calcium phosphate-mediated transfection procedure(35.Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. J. Virol. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref Scopus (6495) Google Scholar). Two days post-transfection, cells were treated with trypsin and diluted into selective medium containing 1 μM methotrexate. Resistant colonies were selected at random and cultured individually. Two colonies (Hepsin-1/BHK and Hepsin-4/BHK) was chosen for examination and cultured in T-75 flasks or 12-well (3.8 cm2) plates containing DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin, and 200 nM methotrexate (DMEM/FCS/PS/MTX). After reaching confluence in 12-well plates, cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM/PS/MTX, and cultured in serum-free DMEM/PS/MTX for 1 day prior to activation studies. BHK cells transfected with “empty” Zem229R expression plasmid (hepsin-free) served as control cells in this study and were cultured in T-75 flasks and 12-well plates in DMEM/FCS/PS/MTX followed by 1-day incubation with serum-free DMEM/PS/MTX prior to activation studies. Untransfected BHK cells and Hepsin-1/BHK cells were grown in culture for RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated from both cell types by the method of Chirgwin et al.(36.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar) and poly(A)+ mRNA was prepared on oligo(dT)-cellulose. First strand cDNA was prepared from each mRNA preparation using reverse transcriptase primed with oligo(dT) primer. Twenty ng of each cDNA was used as template in polymerase chain reactions containing two 24-nucleotide primers with perfect complementarity to the human hepsin cDNA sequence (sense primer = GTG GCA GCT CTC ACT GCG GGG ACC; antisense primer = GAG CAG GGA TCC CCC ACA GAG GTG). In order to minimize the possibility of cross-priming non-human hepsin sequences, the polymerase chain reactions were carried out under “hot start” conditions in which the polymerase was added only after the reactions had reached the first cycle annealing temperature (72°C). Confluent monolayers of Hepsin-1/BHK cells in 12-well plates were washed once with buffer A (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.45) containing 137 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl and 11 mM glucose) and subsequently washed twice with buffer A supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 5 mM CaCl2 (buffer A+). Cell monolayers were then incubated at 37°C with 500 μl of factor VII (final concentration, 10 nM) in buffer A+. At selected intervals, aliquots (30 μl) of the supernatant were removed and immediately assayed for factor VIIa by the TF1–219 assay essentially as described(37.Wildgoose P. Nemerson Y. Hansen L.L. Nielsen F.E. Glazer S. Hedner U. Blood. 1992; 80: 25-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of the diluted sample was placed in a 10 × 75 glass culture tube followed by 100 μl of factor VII-deficient plasma, 50 μl of TF1–219 (final concentration, 1.25 μg/ml), 50 μl of human brain cephalin and 100 μl of 25 mM CaCl2. A standard factor VIIa curve was constructed using various concentrations (2-200 pM) of recombinant factor VIIa. In some experiments, Hepsin-1/BHK cell monolayers were preincubated for 2 h at 37°C with either preimmune rabbit IgG (4 mg/ml in buffer A) or rabbit anti-MBP/hepsin IgG (4 mg/ml in buffer A) prior to the addition of factor VII. To assess structural changes in factor VII during its incubation with Hepsin-1/BHK cells, 20-μl aliquots of the supernatant were removed at selected intervals and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) after reduction with 10% 2-mercaptoethanol. Following electrophoresis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose membranes and visualized with affinity-purified anti-human factor VII IgG (38.Wildgoose P. Kisiel W. Blood. 1989; 73: 1888-1895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 125I-labeled protein A. Confluent monolayers of either BHK cells or Hepsin-1/BHK cells in 12-well plates were incubated with either a mixture of factor VII (10 nM) and factor X (160 nM) or a mixture of factor VII (10 nM), factor X (160 nM), and prothrombin (1 μM) in 500 μl of buffer A+ at 37°C. At selected intervals, 450 μl of the incubation mixture were removed and added to 20 μl of 0.5 M EDTA. An aliquot (280 μl) of this mixture was transferred to a 96-well microtitration plate containing either 40 μl of S-2222 (final concentration, 0.6 mM) for factor Xa assay or 30 μl of S-2238 (final concentration, 90 μM) for thrombin assay. After a preselected incubation time, substrate hydrolysis was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 50% acetic acid, and the absorbance at 405 nm determined in a UVmax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The concentration of factor Xa or thrombin formed in each system was interpolated from a standard curve relating ΔA405/min versus factor Xa (0-50 pM) or thrombin (0-200 pM) concentration. The cytosol and total membrane fractions of Hepsin-1/BHK cells and untransfected BHK cells were prepared essentially as described(39.Morgenstern K.A. Henzel W.J. Baker J.B. Wong S. Pastuszyn A. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21560-21568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, each cell line in a T-75 flask was washed twice with buffer A and dislodged from the flask in buffer A supplemented with 2 mM EDTA by gentle bumping. After centrifugation (1000 revolutions/min; 7 min; 25°C), the cells ( ∼106 cells) were suspended in 450 μl of buffer A and kept at 0°C (ice-water) for 20 min. Cells were then ruptured by six sequential passages though a 25-gauge 1.58-cm needle, and the needle effluent collected directly into thick-walled polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tubes (16 × 76 mm) placed on ice. Fractionation of cell lysates into total membrane and cytosolic fractions was accomplished by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g; 30 min; 4°C) in a Beckman model L5-75 ultracentrifuge equipped with a Beckman type 65 rotor. The cell pellet (total membrane fraction) was resuspended in 450 μl of buffer A+ and washed thee times with buffer A+ before testing for factor VII activating activity. In these studies, Hepsin-1/BHK cell suspension was prepared as described above. An aliquot (200 μl) of the cell suspension containing ∼2 × 106 cells in buffer A was incubated at 37°C with various concentrations of TPCK-treated trypsin. At selected intervals, 200 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor (10 mg/ml in buffer A) was added to the cell suspension. After a 15-min incubation, the cell suspension was centrifuged (1000 revolutions/min; 7 min) and the cells resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A containing 10 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Following an additional 15 min of incubation at 37°C, the cells were centrifuged, and washed six times in buffer A. The cells were then resuspended in 450 μl of buffer A+, 50 μl of factor VII (10 nM final concentration) added, and the mixture incubated at 37°C. At selected intervals, aliquots (30 μl) were removed from this incubation mixture and assayed for factor VIIa as described above. Control experiments indicated no hydrolysis of S-2288 in TPCK-treated trypsin and washed cells indicating that all trypsin activity had been neutralized and removed by the washing steps. In order to investigate the potential involvement of hepsin in the blood coagulation system, we have transfected BHK cells with a plasmid containing the cDNA of human hepsin and investigated the ability of cell-surface-expressed hepsin to activate selected members of the coagulation and anticoagulation pathways. Fig. 1 demonstrates that Hepsin-1/BHK cells, but not untransfected BHK cells, contained mRNA for human hepsin. In order to avoid the possible side effects of adsorbed bovine serum components, Hepsin-1/BHK cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 1 day after reaching confluence and washed once with buffer A prior to the functional studies. Prothrombin (1 μM), protein C (100 nM), factor VII (10 nM), factor X (160 nM), and factor IX (100 nM), dissolved in buffer A+, were incubated separately with Hepsin-1/BHK cells at 37°C for 1 h, and the extent of their activation in the supernatant was measured using either a specific chromogenic substrate assay or a one-stage clotting assay. Of the above proteins, only factor VII was significantly activated under these conditions. Fig. 2A demonstrates that Hepsin-1/BHK cells, but not BHK cells transfected with empty Zem 229R plasmid, activated human factor VII in a time-dependent manner. In a 60-min incubation period, approximately 800 pM factor VIIa was generated in this system, in contrast to no factor VIIa formation on monolayers of BHK cells transfected with empty plasmid (Fig. 2A). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting studies revealed that single-chain factor VII was progressively converted to two-chain factor VIIa resulting in 5-10% of factor VII being converted to factor VIIa in 60 min (Fig. 2B). The amount of factor VIIa formed on Hepsin-1/BHK cell monolayers was variable from experiment to experiment and ranged from 400-900 pM factor VIIa formed in a 60-min period. In addition, comparable factor VII activation rates were observed with another hepsin-transfected cell line designated as Hepsin-4/BHK (data not shown). Pretreatment of Hepsin-1/BHK cells with rabbit anti-maltose-binding protein/hepsin IgG inhibited the ability of the cells to activate factor VII greater than 95%, strongly suggesting that hepsin was in all likelihood responsible for the proteolytic activation of factor VII (Fig. 2A). Control experiments indicated that rabbit anti-MBP/hepsin IgG (0.1-3 mg/ml) had no effect on factor VIIa coagulant activity following incubation with human factor VIIa (10 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37°C. While these results suggest that cell-surface-expressed hepsin is most likely responsible for the activation of factor VII, they do not rule out the possibility that Hepsin-1/BHK cells preferentially synthesize hamster tissue factor, which supports factor VII autoactivation by trace amounts of factor VIIa in the factor VII preparation. In order to address this possibility, we next incubated S344A factor VII, an active site mutant factor VII(20.Nakagaki T. Foster D.C. Berkner K.L. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10819-10824Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), with Hepsin-1/BHK cells and examined structural changes in S344A factor VII during this incubation by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting under reducing conditions. Under these conditions, ∼10% of the single-chain S344A factor VII was converte"
https://openalex.org/W1965626359,"We have previously reported that two closely related protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, PKCα and PKCβI, had divergent effects on the growth and transformation of the same parental R6 rat embryo fibroblast cell line (Housey, G. M., Johnson, M. D., Hsiao, W.-L. W., O'Brian, C. A., Murphey, J. P., Kirschmeier, P., and Weinstein, I. B.(1988) Cell 52, 343-354; Borner, C., Filipuzzi, I., Weinstein, I. B., and Imber, R. (1991) Nature 353, 78-80). Whereas cells that overexpress PKCβI lost anchorage dependence, grew to higher saturation densities, and generated small tumors when injected into nude mice, none of these properties were seen with cells that overexpress PKCα. In fact, the latter cells grew even slower and to lower saturation densities as compared to control cells. Here we investigate possible molecular mechanisms underlying the reciprocal effects of PKCα and PKCβI. Overexpression of both isoforms enhanced 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13 acetate-induced expression of the growth regulatory genes c-jun, c-myc, and collagenase and enhanced feedback inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor binding and cellular levels of diacylglycerol. However, the cells overexpressing PKCβI differed from those overexpressing PKCα by displaying a decreased requirement for growth factors and by the production of a mitogenic factor. Thus, the basis for enhanced growth and transformation of cells overexpressing PKCβI may be the establishment of an autocrine growth factor loop. These findings may be relevant to the roles of specific isoforms of PKC in carcinogenesis and tumor growth.

Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987: 215-340Crossref Google Scholar). PKC-mediated signaling systems are initiated by the stimulation of cell-surface receptors by their respective ligands. This triggers the breakdown of phospholipids by phospholipase C (PLC) and D (PLD) enzymes to produce, among other products, diacylglycerol (DAG)(4.Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar). DAG binds to and activates PKC. This activation is frequently accompanied by increased association of PKC with cellular membranes and the subsequent phosphorylation of various soluble and membrane-bound proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1, 3). Once phosphorylated, PKC substrates may provoke the activation of c-ras(6.Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A.

These latter proteins relay the agonist-evoked signal to the nucleus where gene expression and cell cycle processes are altered(11.Herschman H.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12.Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). Prominent nuclear changes that occur as a result of PKC activation consist of increased expression of immediate early response genes such as c-myc, c-fos/c-jun (AP-1) and others(13.Karin M. Cohen P. Foulkes G. Molecular Aspects of Cellular Regulation. Vol 6. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1990: 236-253Google Scholar). These genes encode transcription factors which alter the expression of secondary response genes whose protein products play major roles in proliferation and differentiation (reviewed in (14.Karin M. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2581-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar)). In addition to its positive effects on signal transduction and gene expression, PKC can also act as a cellular guardian to prevent overstimulation of growth factor-elicited signaling pathways(1.Borner C. Fabbro D. Lester D.S. Epand R.M. Protein Kinase C: Current Concepts and Future Perspectives. Ellis Horwood, Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1992: 297-354Google Scholar, 2.Nishizuka Y.

In view of these complex and reciprocal functions of PKC, it is difficult to provide a simple description of the role of this enzyme in the multistage process of carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, it is now widely accepted that PKC constitutes the major cellular receptor for the potent tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and related compounds(15.Kikkawa U. Takai Y. Tanaka Y. Miayke R. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11442-11445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, the activation of PKC by these compounds enhances the promotion phase of carcinogenesis by altering gene expression and stimulating the growth of initiated cells that carry mutations in oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes. The resulting clonal expansion also increases the likelihood of additional genetic changes(16.Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4135-4143PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Drinkwater N.R. Cancer Cells. 1990; 2: 8-15PubMed Google Scholar). Since TPA can enter cells and directly stimulate PKC, it mimics the action of DAG while bypassing the normal agonist-mediated control of this enzyme(18.Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, since it is much more potent than DAG and only slowly metabolized, TPA causes marked and prolonged activation of PKC(5.Anderson W.B. Estival A. Tapiovaara H. Gopalakrishna R. Cooper D.M.F. Seamon K.B. Advances in Cyclic Nucleotide and Protein Phosphorylation Research. 19. Raven, New York1985: 287-306Google Scholar). Activation of PKC by TPA is also associated with membrane translocation and marked phenotypic effects, including alterations in morphology and stimulation or inhibition of cell growth, depending on the cell system(19.Housey G.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At later time points, phorbol esters usually provoke proteolytic down-regulation of PKC, thereby terminating the effects of PKC activation(1.Borner C. Fabbro D. Lester D.S. Epand R.M. Protein Kinase C: Current Concepts and Future Perspectives. Ellis Horwood, Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1992: 297-354Google Scholar, 3.Woodgett J.R. Hunter T. Gould K.L. Elson E. Frazier W.

Trends Biochem Sci. 1987; 12: 53-54Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This down-regulation abrogates the positive as well as the above-mentioned negative feedback effects of PKC on signal transduction. It is, therefore, not entirely clear whether phorbol esters contribute to tumorigenesis via PKC activation, PKC down-regulation, or a combination of the two processes. The above scenario is further complicated by the fact that PKC comprises a multigene family that encodes at least eleven distinct isoforms(1.Borner C. Fabbro D. Lester D.S. Epand R.M. Protein Kinase C: Current Concepts and Future Perspectives. Ellis Horwood, Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1992: 297-354Google Scholar, 2.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar). These isoforms can be divided into three subgroups based on sequence homologies and cofactor requirements: conventional PKC (α, βI, βII, γ) that are dependent on Ca2+ for activity and membrane localization; non-conventional PKCs (δ, ε, η/L, θ) that are not dependent on Ca2+; and atypical PKCs ( ζ, λ, τ) that are not dependent on Ca2+ and are not stimulated by DAG or TPA (reviewed in Refs. 1, 2). The expression of these isoforms varies between tissues and cell types(1.Borner C. Fabbro D. Lester D.S. Epand R.M. Protein Kinase C: Current Concepts and Future Perspectives. Ellis Horwood, Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1992: 297-354Google Scholar, 2.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar, 26.Wetsel W.C. Khan W.A.

It seems likely, therefore, that individual isoforms differ with respect to their roles in growth control and other specific biologic effect, but possible redundancies in their functions may also exist. It has been difficult to examine this question since individual cells often express more than one isoform of PKC and at the present time isoform specific inhibitors are not available. We have pursued a genetic approach to analyze the question of isoform specificity by utilizing gene transfer methods to develop derivatives of cell lines that stably overexpress high levels of a particular PKC isoform and then examining various biochemical and phenotypic properties of these derivatives. We previously reported that overexpression of PKCα and PKCβ, two closely related conventional PKC isoforms, had opposite effects on the growth of the rat embryo fibroblast cell line R6(19.Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Hsiao W.-L. W. O'Brian C.A. Murphy J.P. Kirschmeier P. Weinstein I.B. Cell. 1988; 52: 343-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 22.Borner C. Filipuzzi I. Weinstein I.B. Imber R. Nature. 1991; 353: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigate the mechanisms underlying these divergent growth effects of PKCβI and PKCα. Our results provide some of the first direct evidence that, even when expressed in the same cell type, two isoforms of PKC can be redundant with respect to certain biologic effects but differ markedly with respect to other biologic effects.

Silverstein S. Lee L.-S. Pellicer A. Cheng Y.-C. Axel R. Cell. 1977; 11: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Following selection for resistance to G418, a panel of PKCα-transfected clones was isolated, expanded, and examined by Northern blot analysis for expression of the respective PKCα transcripts (data not shown). Clones expressing high (R6-bPKC4α), intermediate (R6-bPKC3α), or low (R6-bPKC7α) amounts of the expected 8.0-kilobase PKCα mRNA (LTR to LTR transcript), and control cells transfected with the retroviral vector alone (R6-SVXc1) were chosen for further studies. Pools of G418-resistant colonies were also collected, expanded, and used for our studies. Western blot analysis of total cellular extracts showed that when compared to R6-SVXc1 vector control cells, R6-bPKC4α, R6-bPKC3α, and R6-bPKC7α cells contained 41-, 25-, and 15-fold higher levels of the 81-kDa PKCα protein, respectively (data not shown). These results correlated with increased in vitro protein kinase and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) binding activities (data not shown). All cells were grown in serum-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies) as described(19.Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Hsiao W.-L. W. O'Brian C.A. Murphy J.P. Kirschmeier P.

Starving of the cultures or growth to post-confluence were strictly avoided, unless they were required for special purposes such as DNA synthesis or foci formation assays. All experiments reported here were performed on early passage cells kept in culture for less than 6 weeks. The cells were generally harvested for RNA or protein when subconfluent. Doubling times and saturation densities of the various cell derivatives were determined exactly as described (19.Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Hsiao W.-L. W. O'Brian C.A. Murphy J.P. Kirschmeier P.

Nature. 1991; 353: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with the modification that the cells were grown in 1% instead of 10% CS. Total SDS extracts and native cytosolic and membrane fractions of cellular proteins were prepared exactly as described(27.Borner C. Guadagno Nichols S. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12892-12899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Borner C. Guadagno Nichols S. Hsieh L.-L. Hsiao W.-L. W. Weinstein I.B.

Cell Growth Diff. 1990; 1: 653-660PubMed Google Scholar). Primary PKC isotype-specific antibodies were used on immunoblots as 1:500 (PKCα) or 1:2000 (PKCε, δ) dilutions(27.Borner C. Guadagno Nichols S. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12892-12899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-Labeled sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit reagents were used as secondary antibodies in a final dilution of 0.3 μCi/ml. For immunocytochemical analysis, subconfluent R6 cell derivatives were fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with methanol, stained with M4 (PKCα-specific) or M7 (PKCα- and PKCβ-specific) monoclonal antibodies and finally with fluorescein-conjugated second antibody, as described previously(33.Jaken S. Leach K. Klauck T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from untreated and TPA-treated control and PKC-overexpressing cells in parallel and transferred by capillary blotting onto Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham) as described previously(27.Borner C. Guadagno Nichols S. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12892-12899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The murine c-myc(34.Stanton L.W. Watt R. Marcu K.B. Nature. 1983; 303: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) was kindly supplied by L.-L. Hsieh, the c-fos and c-jun probes (35.Rauscher III, F.J. Voulalas P.J. Franza Jr., B.R. Curran T. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1687-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) were from T. Curran, and the human collagenase probe (36.Angel P. Baumann T. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) was purchased from Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY. The relative abundance of RNA/lane was judged to be similar by comparing the ethidium bromide staining of the ribosomal bands. For further confirmation, the blots were hybridized with a probe for an endogenous housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). In all cases, the ethidium bromide staining reflected the results obtained by the GAPDH probe. Control and PKC-overexpressing R6 cells were seeded in 100-mm plastic dishes, grown in DMEM plus 5% serum (in the absence of G418), and refed 48 h before harvesting at 50-80% confluence. 24 h or 30 min before harvesting (lipid extraction), cells on duplicate dishes were treated with 100 ng/ml TPA in 0.1% Me2SO. Control dishes received 0.1% Me2SO alone. Lipid extraction was performed exactly as described(37.Van Veldhoven P.P. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 185-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). DAG was assayed by its conversion into [32P]PA acid in vitro as described. A DAG standard (0.4 nmol) was run in parallel. DAG data were normalized to phospholipid phosphate determined by the method of Ames (38.Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1964; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3031) Google Scholar) and the DAG value expressed as a mol %. Serum-starved subconfluent vector control or PKC-overexpressing cell cultures were either stimulated with serum, single growth factors, or conditioned medium from PKC-overexpressing cells, and 15 h later [3H]thymidine incorporation into the DNA of these cells was determined exactly as described(39.Hoshina S. Ueffing M. Weinstein I.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All assays were done in triplicate wells, and the variability was less than 10%. Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from PKC-overexpressing cells as follows. Complete medium was removed from subconfluent cultures, and the cultures were washed with DMEM and incubated for 30 h in DMEM in the absence of serum. This CM was collected, cleared of any cell debris by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 90 min, and a 100-200-μl aliquot was added to serum-starved control R6 cells to test for its capacity to induce DNA synthesis. Cells were seeded in DMEM, 10% CS (without G418) in 24-well dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well. 100 ng/ml TPA or 0.1% Me2SO (control) was added to the medium 24 h, 6 h, or 30 min prior to the binding assay. 48 h after seeding, monolayers were washed three times in DMEM buffered with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and then incubated with 1 nM 125I-EGF (1 μCi/well, 130 μCi/μg, 1.5 × 105 counts/min/ng) in the same medium for 2 h on ice. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed twice with medium and solubilized with 1 ml of 0.2 N NaOH, 1% SDS. After 60 min at 37°C, radioactivity of the solubilized cells was determined. Nonspecific binding was determined by parallel incubation of each sample with a 100-fold excess of cold EGF. Specific binding was calculated as total minus nonspecific cell-associated radioactivity. Both specific and nonspecific binding were determined in triplicates for each time point. Immunoblots, Northern blots, or thin layer plates were autoradiographed with Kodak XAR film at −70°C and the relative abundance of protein, RNA, or lipid was quantitated by scanning preflashed autoradiographs on a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) or by direct assays of the blots using Betascope counting (Betagen). Values were taken from the linear range of a 125I or 32P standard curve. Both methods gave similar results. We have previously shown that rat PKCβI and mouse PKCα had distinct effects on the growth of a rat 6 (R6) embryo fibroblast cell line(19.Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Hsiao W.-L. W. O'Brian C.A.

Nature. 1991; 353: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whereas overexpression of the former provoked enhanced growth and partial transformation(19.Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Hsiao W.-L. W. O'Brian C.A. Murphy J.P. Kirschmeier P. Weinstein I.B. Cell. 1988; 52: 343-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), overexpression of the latter led to a marked inhibition of cellular growth(22.Borner C. Filipuzzi I. Weinstein I.B. Imber R. Nature. 1991; 353: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study we generated R6 cell lines which overexpress bovine PKCα to various extents. Consistent with our previous findings, bovine PKCα impeded growth in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown, see also Fig. 5). To understand the basis for the disparate growth effects of PKCβI and PKCα, we performed a series of biochemical and molecular analyses on two PKCβI- and three PKCα-overexpressing cell lines. We show here the results of R6-PKC3βI (overexpressing PKCβI 50-fold) and R6-bPKC4α cells (overexpressing bovine PKCα 40-fold) as representatives. Similar results were obtained with R6 cell derivatives overexpressing PKCβI or PKCα 10-20-fold (data not shown). We first examined whether the growth differences can be explained by differential activation/translocation or down-regulation of the overexpressed or endogenously expressed PKC isoforms in response to the phorbol esters TPA or PDBu. This is because these agents were previously shown to activate PKC in vivo(18.Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to exaggerate the disparate effects of PKCβI and PKCα on the growth of R6 cells(19.Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Hsiao W.-L. W. O'Brian C.A. Murphy J.P. Kirschmeier P. Weinstein I.B. Cell. 1988; 52: 343-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 22.Borner C. Filipuzzi I. Weinstein I.B. Imber R. Nature. 1991; 353: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analysis on intact R6-PKC3βI and R6-bPKC4α cells revealed that the overexpressed PKCα and PKCβI resided mainly in the cytoplasm of cells when the cells were grown under standard conditions (Fig. 1). Upon treatment of the cells with phorbol esters, both PKCα and PKCβI rapidly redistributed from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. This event, called translocation, has been shown to be associated with PKC activation(5.Anderson W.B. Estival A. Tapiovaara H. Gopalakrishna R. Cooper D.M.F. Seamon K.B. Advances in Cyclic Nucleotide and Protein Phosphorylation Research. 19. Raven, New York1985: 287-306Google Scholar). There was also intensive membrane ruffling (Fig. 1) presumably associated with rearrangements of the underlying cytoskeleton. Since membrane ruffling was exaggerated in both the PKCα- and PKCβI-overexpressing cells, it is apparent that both of these isoforms can induce this morphologic change. With prolonged treatment of cells with TPA or PDBu, the translocation of PKC isoforms is usually associated with “down-regulation” of these enzymes due to proteolysis(25.Murray A.W. Fournier A. Hardy S.J. Trends Biochem Sci. 1987; 12: 53-54Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Isoforms of PKC differ in their susceptibility to down-regulation, and this is also a function of cell type (reviewed in (1.Borner C. Fabbro D. Lester D.S. Epand R.M. Protein Kinase C: Current Concepts and Future Perspectives. Ellis Horwood, Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1992: 297-354Google Scholar)). Here we found that whereas overexpressed PKCβI was almost completely depleted from R6-PKC3βI cells, overexpressed PKCα is partially resistant to down-regulation in R6-bPKC4α cells at 24 h after treatment with phorbol esters (Fig. 1). This could be shown both by immunocytochemical analysis on intact cells (Fig. 1) as well as by Western blots on cytosolic and membrane fractions (Fig. 2A and (40.Guadagno Nichols S. Borner C. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2697-2707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Appreciable amounts of PKCα but not PKCβI were still immunodetectable in cells treated with repetitive doses of TPA or PDBu for 28 days (data not shown).Figure 2Subcellular distribution and down-regulation of ectopically overexpressed PKCα and endogenously expressed PKCε and PKCε in R6 cells treated with TPA.

https://openalex.org/W1984948155,"The CCAAT-binding factor CBF is a heteromeric transcription factor that specifically binds to CCAAT sequences in many eukaryotic genes. CBF consists of three subunits, CBF-A, CBF-B, and CBF-C, all three of which are necessary for DNA binding. In this study we examined the transcription activation function of CBF by two different approaches. We first used a heterologous system in which a series of deletion mutations of CBF-B, fused to the bacterial LexA DNA binding domain, were transfected into HeLa cells together with a reporter gene driven by a minimal promoter containing LexA binding sites. These experiments showed that CBF-B needed both a glutamine-rich domain and an adjacent serine/threonine-rich domain to activate the reporter gene optimally. The glutamine-rich domain by itself activated transcription only modestly. We also set up an in vitro transcription reconstituted system in which trans-activation by CBF occurred through a physiological CCAAT motif. Nuclear extracts from NIH 3T3 cells were first depleted of CBF and then complemented with recombinant CBF-B and a highly purified fraction containing native CBF-A and CBF-C. Recombinant full-length CBF-B together with CBF-A and CBF-C activated transcription of several α2(I) collagen gene promoter constructs. We then tested whether in this system the glutamine- and serine/threonine-rich domains of CBF-B were needed for trans-activation by CBF. We generated a truncated form of CBF-B that was still able to bind DNA in the presence of CBF-A and CBF-C. Even in the absence of the glutamine- and serine/threonine-rich domains of CBF-B, reconstituted CBF did activate transcription, suggesting that CBF transcriptional activation can also be mediated by the other subunits of CBF or by another transcription factor present in the nuclear extracts that interacts with CBF. Taken together our results suggest a model in which CBF has the potential to activate transcription either through the glutamine- and serine/threonine-rich domains of CBF-B or through the other subunits of CBF or through another component recruited by CBF."

Nuclear translocation of NF-κB is preceded by the proteolytic degradation of IκBα, an ankyrin motif-rich inhibitor that traps NF-κB in the cytoplasm. In addition, formation of cytoplasmic NF-κB/IκBα complexes in quiescent cells requires constitutive proteolytic processing of p105, another ankyrin motif-rich inhibitory protein from which the p50 subunit of NF-κB is generated. We have demonstrated that, following stimulation of human monocytic cells with lipopolysaccharide or tumor necrosis factor-α, this critical p105 processing event is up-regulated in concert with the inactivation of IκBα. Moreover, the degradative loss of both p105 and IκBα is prevented in cells depleted of intracellular ATP. In activated monocytes, however, IκBα degradation occurs more rapidly than p105 processing to p50.

INTRODUCTIONThe NF-κB 1Abbreviations used: NF-κBnuclear factor κBIκBαinhibitor κBαLPSlipopolysaccharideTNFtumor necrosis factor-αCHXcycloheximide./Rel family of transcription factors participates in the induced expression of a diverse set of cellular and viral genes that are activated in response to immune and inflammatory signals. This set includes cellular genes that encode cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, and procoagulant factors. In addition, NF-κB is involved in the initiation of transcription from viral promoters that control the expression of human immunodeficiency virus 1 and cytomegalovirus (see (1.Grilli M. Chiu J.J.-S. Lenardo M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) for review). Typically, NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm as a ternary complex composed of two DNA binding subunits, termed RelA (p65) and NF-κB1 (p50), bound to an ankyrin motif-rich inhibitor called IκBα (see (2.Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar) for review). This labile inhibitory protein is rapidly degraded in response to multiple cellular activation signals, thereby permitting nuclear expression of the functional NF-κB p50/RelA complex (see (3.Beg A.A.

(i) p105 resides exclusively in the cytosolic compartment independent of the status of cellular activation(8.Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israel A.

These findings point to a dynamic relationship between p105/p50, IκBα, and RelA at the protein and DNA levels that define at least two distinct autoregulatory mechanisms for NF-κB-directed transcription(1.Grilli M. Chiu J.J.-S. Lenardo M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 3.Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar).Despite these structural and functional similarities of p105 and IκBα, the proteolytic mechanisms that control their inhibitory activities remain ill defined. Here we demonstrate that treatment of human monocytic cells with either bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) stimulates p105 processing to p50 via an ATP-dependent pathway. Moreover, agonist-induced degradation of the structurally related IκBα protein, which occurs with more rapid kinetics relative to p105 processing, is also regulated by an ATP-dependent process. These findings suggest that proteolytic processing of p105 and IκBα in monocytic cells may be differentially induced during the course of an inflammatory reaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSImmunoblot and Gel Shift AnalysisTHP-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured and subjected to subcellular fractionation as described(19.Cordle S.R.

Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.) using either p105-specific (amino acids 947-969) or IκBα-specific (amino acids 289-317) antipeptide rabbit antibodies in combination with a secondary donkey anti-rabbit antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham). For gel shift studies, DNA binding reactions containing a radiolabeled κB probe derived from the mouse immunoglobulin κ enhancer were prepared and fractionated on native gels(19.Cordle S.R. Donald R. Read M.A. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11803-11810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Pulse-Chase ExperimentsTHP-1 cells (106 cells/ml) were cultured in methionine and cysteine-free medium for 1 h and then pulse-labeled for 3 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (Tran 35S-label; DuPont NEN). Radiolabeled cells were washed and resuspended in medium containing either LPS (10 μg/ml Escherichia coli LPS 0127:B8; Difco), TNF (100 units/ml; Mallinckrodt), or no agonist. Cytosolic extracts were prepared at the times indicated, diluted with RIPA buffer (21.Green P.L. Yip M.T. Xie Y. Chen I.S.Y. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4325-4330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 1% deoxycholate, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g (1 h at 4°C) to remove particulate matter. Lysates were initially precleared with normal rabbit serum in combination with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma) and then immunoprecipitated with p105/p50-specific (amino acids 1-21) antipeptide rabbit antibody in combination with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed in RIPA buffer and proteins were eluted by boiling in the presence of 1% SDS and specific peptide (1 mg/ml). Supernatants were diluted to 0.1% SDS with RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with p105-specific antiserum (amino acids 947-969). Immunoprecipitates were washed in RIPA buffer, boiled in the presence of 4% SDS and 10%β-mercaptoethanol, and subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled polypeptides were visualized by fluorography and quantitated by phosphorimager analysis (Molecular Dynamics model 425E).Intracellular ATP Depletion StudiesTHP-1 cell cultures (106 cells/ml) were treated with antimycin A (4 μg/ml) and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (6.5 mM; Sigma) for 2 h (22.Holmsen H. Setkowsky C.A. Day H.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 144: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), followed by treatment with either LPS (10 μg/ml) or TNF (100 units/ml) for the times indicated. Cell extracts were prepared as described above and subjected to immunoblot and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses. To assess the efficiency of ATP depletion, stimulated cultures were lysed in 2% trichloroacetic acid, neutralized by addition of 0.1 M Tris, pH 9 (1:1), and analyzed for ATP levels using a luciferase enzyme assay in conjunction with calibration standards relating ATP concentrations to bioluminescence (ATP bioluminescence kit; Sigma).RESULTSInduction of p105 Proteolysis in Monocytes by Pro-inflammatory MediatorsThe NF-κB signaling pathway is activated in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage by several pro-inflammatory agents, including LPS and TNF(19.Cordle S.R. Donald R. Read M.A. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11803-11810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Haas J.G. Baeuerle P.A. Riethmuller G. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9563-9567Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Despite the induction of NF-κB1 mRNA in response to LPS(19.Cordle S.R. Donald R. Read M.A. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11803-11810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cellular stimulation led to significant loss of p105 protein within 2 h (Fig. 1, middlepanel, lanes1 and 4). The reappearance of p105 protein at 3 h following LPS stimulation (Fig. 1, middlepanel, lane5) is attributed to the 15-fold induction of NF-kB1 mRNA in response to LPS(19.Cordle S.R. Donald R. Read M.A. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11803-11810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, two electrophoretically distinct forms of p105 were detected in these experiments, both of which diminished during cellular stimulation (indicated by arrows in Fig. 1, middle and lowerpanels). Proteolysis of p105 was even more pronounced when cells were pretreated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) to preclude de novo synthesis of p105 (Fig. 1, lowerpanel, lanes3-5), which eliminated the increase in p105 protein observed at later time points (Fig. 1, middlepanel, lane5). NF-κB-specific DNA binding activity was readily detected in nuclear extracts prepared from the same LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 1, middlepanel, lanes 7-10). Using competition and supershift assays, we have previously demonstrated that these gel shift activities correspond to p50/RelA and p50/c-Rel complexes(19.Cordle S.R. Donald R. Read M.A. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11803-11810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparative experiments performed with TNF as the NF-κB inducing agent indicated that TNF also stimulates p105 degradation, albeit with lower efficiency (see below).Pulse-Chase AnalysisTo determine the half-life of p105 under steady-state conditions reflecting constitutive versus signal-dependent proteolysis, THP-1 cells were pulse-labeled for 3 h and chased for up to 8 h in media containing LPS, TNF, or no agonist (Fig. 2a). Based on five independent experiments, the half-life (t) values for p105 were derived from best-fit curves encompassing all data points. The t of p105 in unstimulated cells was greater than 8 h, whereas the corresponding t values in LPS- and TNF-stimulated cells were approximately 70 min and 300 min, respectively (Fig. 2b).Figure 2Pulse-chase analysis of p105 in unstimulated and LPS- or TNF-stimulated THP-1 cells. a, a representative pulse-chase experiment performed as described under “Materials and Methods.”14C-Labeled molecular weight standards (Amersham Corp.) are indicated in kilodaltons (kDa). b, quantitative phosphorimager analysis of pulse-chase data from five independent experiments.

For these experiments, the pulse-labeling time was reduced to 2 h to minimize the incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids into p50. Radiolabeled proteins were detected in whole cell extracts by immunoprecipitation with p105/p50-specific antipeptide antibody and elution with the corresponding antibody-specific peptide. In addition to the radiolabeled pools of p105 and p50, radiolabeled IκBα was also detected due to its tight association with NF-κB complexes containing p50 (Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 3b, the loss of p105 in LPS-stimulated cells was associated with a stoichiometric increase in the amount of p50. These results strongly imply a direct precursor/product relationship between p105 and p50 in activated monocytic cells, a finding that is fully consistent with that described for the basal processing of ectopic p105 in transfected monkey COS cells(13.Fan C.-M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).Figure 3Pulse-chase analysis of p50, p105, and IκBα. a, THP-1 cells were pulse-labeled (lanes 1 and 5) with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine and chased either in the absence (lanes 2-4) or presence (lanes 6-8) of LPS (10 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with p105/p50-specific (amino acids 1-21) antipeptide antibody, fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by fluorography. 14C-Labeled molecular weight standards are indicated in kilodaltons (kDa). p105, p50, and IκBα proteins are indicated by arrows. b, quantitative phosphorimager analysis of pulse-chase data from three independent experiments.

Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) have reported that processing of p105 in vitro occurs via an ATP-dependent mechanism. We extended these observations to the in vivo processing of p105 induced in human monocytic cells by LPS. THP-1 cell cultures were depleted of intracellular ATP prior to stimulation. Based on bioluminescence assays (see “Materials and Methods”), the level of ATP in these THP-1 cells was reduced by 93-97% of that measured in untreated cells. In immunoblotting studies, the degradation of p105 was completely inhibited in ATP-depleted THP-1 cells (Fig. 4, lower panel, lanes 1-5). Furthermore, gel shift analyses of nuclear extracts from these cells showed that the depletion of intracellular ATP also prevented LPS-induced κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 4, lower panel, lanes 6-10). These in vivo findings strongly suggest that p105 processing involves a proteolytic mechanism that requires ATP utilization.Figure 4Effect of intracellular ATP depletion on p105 proteolysis and nuclear NF-κB expression in LPS-stimulated monocytes. THP-1 cells were depleted of intracellular ATP for 2 h (see “Materials and Methods”) and then cultured either in the presence (lower panels) or absence (upper panels) of LPS (10 μg/ml). As a control, cells replete with ATP were stimulated with LPS (10 μg/ml; middle panels). Cytosolic extracts were subjected to immunoblot analyses using p105-specific antipeptide antibody. Nuclear extracts from the same cells were assayed for NF-κB DNA binding activity by gel shift analyses. A composite of the resultant κB-specific nucleoprotein complexes is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Comparative Analysis of IκBαIn comparison to p105, pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that LPS-stimulation led to the rapid degradation of IκBα as evidenced by the loss of over 70% of radiolabeled IκBα within 30 min (Fig. 3b). Consistent with these results, immunoblot analyses using IκBα-specific antisera demonstrated that IκBα is degraded within 30 min following LPS or TNF stimulation (Fig. 5, a and b, middlepanels, lane2). In addition, newly synthesized IκBα reappeared between 1 and 2 h after either TNF or LPS stimulation (Fig. 5b, middlepanel, lanes3 and 4). The rapid kinetics of induced IκBα degradation was in sharp contrast to the relatively slow kinetics of p105 processing but was fully consistent with the pattern of nuclear NF-κB expression in LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 1, middle panel, lanes 7-10). This finding strongly suggests that the rapid mobilization of NF-κB during the initial phases of monocyte activation is primarily due to the degradation of IκBα. Like p105, proteolysis of IκBα induced by LPS and TNF appears to occur through an ATP-dependent mechanism(s) since this degradative pathway was also blocked in cells depleted of ATP (Fig. 5, c and d, lower panels).Figure 5IκBα proteolysis in stimulated and ATP-depleted monocytes. a and b, immunoblot analyses using IκBα-specific (amino acids 289-317) antipeptide antibody were performed on cytosolic extracts from THP-1 cells treated with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), lipopolysaccharide (10 μg/ml), tumor necrosis factor-α (100 units/ml), or the indicated combinations of these reagents. CHX was added 30 min prior to the addition of agonists. c and d, immunoblot analyses using IκBα-specific antipeptide antibody were performed on cytosolic extracts from THP-1 cells that were depleted of intracellular ATP and cultured either in the absence (-ATP; upper panels) or presence (lower panels) of either LPS (10 μg/ml) or TNF (100 units/ml) for the indicated times. In control experiments, cells replete with ATP were stimulated with either LPS (10 μg/ml) or TNF (100 units/ml) (middle panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThese studies with human monocytic cells demonstrate that proteolytic processing of p105 is stimulated significantly in response to the pro-inflammatory agents LPS and TNF. As such, inducible proteolysis regulates not only the level of IκBα in activated monocytes(19.Cordle S.R. Donald R. Read M.A. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11803-11810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Haas J.G. Baeuerle P.A. Riethmuller G. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1993; 90: 2532-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), but also the levels of p105 and p50. These findings are in accord with some (25.Mercurio F. DiDonato J. Rosette C. Karin K. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 26.Mellits K.H. Hay R.T. Goodbourn S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5059-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) but not all (27.Rice N.R. Ernst M.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4685-4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) reports regarding the regulation of p105 in other experimental systems. The rate of p105 processing may therefore be influenced in an agonist- and/or cell type-dependent manner. We have also shown that the in vivo processing of p105 in human monocytic cells is ATP-dependent, thus extending the in vitro findings of Fan and Maniatis (13.Fan C.-M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In this regard, evidence is emerging that p105 and IκBα are both phosphorylated during cellular activation(19.Cordle S.R. Donald R. Read M.A. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11803-11810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Mellits K.H. Hay R.T. Goodbourn S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5059-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 28.Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the relationship between phosphorylation and degradation remains unknown. Notwithstanding this uncertainty, the critical requirement for ATP in p105 processing documented in our studies is fully consistent with recent findings that the 26S proteasome specifically mediates this p105 processing event(29.Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar).Our results provide further evidence that the NF-κB transcription factor system can be regulated at multiple levels through the induced proteolysis of IκB inhibitory subunits and NF-κB precursor proteins. The different rates observed for induced IκBα and p105 proteolysis in these studies imply a bimodal function for proteolysis, namely to permit nuclear translocation of NF-κB and to supply a second wave of p50 subunits. This second wave could include p50 homodimers, which have been reported to repress gene transcription in a LPS-tolerant monocytic cell line(30.Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Wedel A. Schraut W. Strobel M. Wendelgass P. Sternsdorf T. Baeuerle P.A. Haas J.G. Riethmuller G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17001-17004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the dilatory generation of p50 in association with RelA could provide a mechanism to replenish the cytoplasmic pool of preformed NF-κB that is released from IκBα and rapidly mobilized to the nucleus. INTRODUCTIONThe NF-κB 1Abbreviations used: NF-κBnuclear factor κBIκBαinhibitor κBαLPSlipopolysaccharideTNFtumor necrosis factor-αCHXcycloheximide./Rel family of transcription factors participates in the induced expression of a diverse set of cellular and viral genes that are activated in response to immune and inflammatory signals. This set includes cellular genes that encode cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, and procoagulant factors. In addition, NF-κB is involved in the initiation of transcription from viral promoters that control the expression of human immunodeficiency virus 1 and cytomegalovirus (see (1.Grilli M. Chiu J.J.-S. Lenardo M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) for review). Typically, NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm as a ternary complex composed of two DNA binding subunits, termed RelA (p65) and NF-κB1 (p50), bound to an ankyrin motif-rich inhibitor called IκBα (see (2.Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar) for review). This labile inhibitory protein is rapidly degraded in response to multiple cellular activation signals, thereby permitting nuclear expression of the functional NF-κB p50/RelA complex (see (3.Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) for review).An unusual feature of the NF-κB1 gene encoding p50 is its capacity to specify a larger precursor protein, termed p105(4.Kieran M.

(i) p105 resides exclusively in the cytosolic compartment independent of the status of cellular activation(8.Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israel A.

Cell. 1992; 68: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar); (ii) p105 contains an ankyrin motif-rich carboxyl-terminal domain that inhibits the nuclear expression and DNA binding activity of its amino-terminal half(8.Blank V.

Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar); (iii) p105, like IκBα, physically sequesters RelA in the cytoplasmic compartment (14.Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar); and (iv) the inducible genes encoding p105 and IκBα both contain functional NF-κB binding sites(15.Ten R.M.

Bilirubin (Fig. 1),) the cytotoxic yellow-orange pigment of jaundice is biosynthesized in normal metabolism of healthy adults at the rate of about 300 mg per day. This water-insoluble and lipophilic linear tetrapyrrole dicarboxylic acid is found characteristically in mammals, where it is produced in copious quantities by catabolism of heme, principally from the hemoglobin of red blood cells(1.McDonagh A.F. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. 6. Academic Press, New York1979: 293-491Crossref Google Scholar, 2.Ostrow J.D. Bile Pigments and Jaundice. Marcel-Dekker, New York1986Google Scholar). Bilirubin is essentially unexcretable in its native form but is efficiently cleared by the body following conversion in the liver to water-soluble glucuronides that are promptly secreted into bile. Accumulation of bilirubin and its glucuronides in the body is caused by certain pathologic conditions and sometimes results in jaundice(3.Gollan J.L. Semin. Liver Dis. 1988; 8 (2)PubMed Google Scholar). Although impaired excretion of the glucuronides occurs in many types of hepatobiliary disease, retention of native bilirubin is principally observed in newborn babies(4.Maisels M.J. Clinics in Perinatology: Neonatal Jaundice. 17. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1990Google Scholar). What limits the facile excretability of bilirubin is its poor water solubility (estimated Ksp∼3 × 10−15 M for bilirubin in water at 37°C)(5.Brodersen R. Ostrow J.D. Bile Pigments and Jaundice. Academic Press, New York1986: 158Google Scholar), high lipid/water partition coefficient(6.McDonagh A.F. Lightner D.A. Pediatrics. 1985; 75: 443-455PubMed Google Scholar), and proclivity to form association complexes with serum albumin and other proteins(1.McDonagh A.F. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. 6.

Although the structure of bilirubin has been well known since it was proved over 50 years ago(8.Fischer H. Plieninger H. Weissbarth O. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1941; 268: 197-226Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the interesting biological and unusual solubility properties of bilirubin (6.McDonagh A.F. Lightner D.A. Pediatrics. 1985; 75: 443-455PubMed Google Scholar) do not correlate well with conventional linear representation (Fig. 1B) favored by Fischer (8.Fischer H. Plieninger H. Weissbarth O. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1941; 268: 197-226Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or the porphyrin-like structure (Fig. 1A) that would follow logically from the structure of the heme precursor. If bilirubin adopted such conformations, which we now know are sterically disfavored, it would be predictably polar, not lipophilic, and very likely excretable across the liver into bile without resort to glucuronidation(9.McDonagh A.F. Lightner D.A. Bock K.W. Gerock W. Matern S. Hepatic Metabolism and Disposition of Endo and Xenobiotics. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1991: 47-59Google Scholar). The unusual properties of bilirubin are hardly changed in its analogs with vinyl groups reduced to ethyls as in mesobilirubin IXα, or even when they are symmetrically arranged as in mesobilirubin IIIα or XIIIα. But major changes attend relocating the propionic acid groups away from C-8 and C-12. For example, transposing the propionic acid groups with the adjacent methyl groups at C-7 and C-13 yields a pigment, mesobilirubin IVα (Fig. 1C), that is more polar, and excretable without requiring glucuronidation or other structural modification(9.McDonagh A.F. Lightner D.A. Bock K.W. Gerock W. Matern S. Hepatic Metabolism and Disposition of Endo and Xenobiotics. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1991: 47-59Google Scholar, 10.Trull F.R. Franklin R.W. Lightner D.A. J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1987; 24: 1573-1579Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Correlation of propionic acid group location and the chemical, biological, and physical properties of bilirubin is, however, only one important structural consideration. Other stereochemical determinants include configuration and conformation of the tetrapyrrole skeleton, elements of three-dimensional structure common to all bilirubin pigments. Conformation plays a key role, especially the changes in shape brought about by rotations of the dipyrrinone groups about the central CH2 groups at C-10. Such rotations bring about major stereochemical changes, interconverting the linear and porphyrin-like structures of Fig. 1, A and B, inter alia, and generating a vast array of pigment shapes, of which one type is possessed of unique properties. In this conformation, the dipyrrinones are rotated about the C-9 to C-10 and C-10 to C11 carbon-carbon single bonds so as to create a ridge-tile shape where the propionic acid CO2H groups and dipyrrinone NH and C=O groups are brought into sufficiently close proximity to allow them to engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Such intramolecular hydrogen bonding stabilizes the ridge-tile conformation (Fig. 2) to such an extent that it is thought to persist and have a dominating influence on conformation under a variety of solvation and ionization conditions. It is also thought to explain many properties of the molecule, such as its high oil-water partition coefficient(6.McDonagh A.F. Lightner D.A. Pediatrics. 1985; 75: 443-455PubMed Google Scholar), its resistance to hepatobiliary excretion(9.McDonagh A.F. Lightner D.A. Bock K.W. Gerock W. Matern S. Hepatic Metabolism and Disposition of Endo and Xenobiotics. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1991: 47-59Google Scholar), and, unusual for a carboxylic acid, its insolubility in aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution(6.McDonagh A.F. Lightner D.A. Pediatrics. 1985; 75: 443-455PubMed Google Scholar). Stabilization of the bilirubin ridge-tile conformation by a complementary network of intramolecular hydrogen bonds was first detected by x-ray crystallography (11.Bonnett R. Davies J.E. Hursthouse M.B. Sheldrick G.M. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1978; 202: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 12.LeBas G. Allegret A. Mauguen Y. DeRango C. Bailly M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B. 1980; B36: 3007-3011Crossref Google Scholar) in the solid where bilirubin is folded into either of two ridge-tile-shaped enantiomers (Fig. 2). Intramolecular hydrogen bonding has also been detected by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 1The abbreviations used are: NMRnuclear magnetic resonanceNOEnuclear Overhauser effect.in solution(13.Kaplan D. Navon G. Isr. J. Chem. 1983; 23: 177-186Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14.Trull F.R. Ma J.S. Landen G.L. Lightner D.A. Isr. J. Chem. 1983; 23(2): 211-218Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar), where the bilirubin conformers are thought to persist as a pair of interconverting conformational enantiomers (Fig. 2), and in organic solvents that do not strongly perturb the matrix of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The conformational structure is less clear in solvents or other agents that may disrupt the folded pigment's hydrogen bonding matrix. In the strong hydrogen bond acceptor, (CD3)2SO, 13C NMR analysis of segmental motion in the propionic acid chains indicates that the -COOH residues are tethered to the dipyrrinones via bound solvent molecules (15.Kaplan D. Navon G. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but the precise conformation of the pigment in (CH3)2SO is uncertain(16.Hsieh Y.-Z. Morris M.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 62-67Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In metabolism, bilirubin is found bound to albumin or other proteins, in membranes, micelles or to a lesser extent, in aqueous solution. But here again, the conformation of bilirubin is poorly understood. Yet, an intramolecularly hydrogen bonded conformation is thought to be essential for hepatic glucuronidation and excretion(9.McDonagh A.F. Lightner D.A. Bock K.W. Gerock W. Matern S. Hepatic Metabolism and Disposition of Endo and Xenobiotics. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1991: 47-59Google Scholar). In order to understand whether intramolecular hydrogen bonding persists in solutions of bilirubin, we have prepared [83,123- 13C2]-mesobilirubin XIIIα, measured the NMR 13C{1H} heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) between its dipyrrinone N-H's and propionic acid 13CO2H groups, and calculated their non-bonded distances. These results are important because they help define a comprehensive picture of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and the probable shape and stereochemistry of bilirubin in solution, and also illustrate a method for determining the structure of bilirubin in biological tissues. nuclear magnetic resonance nuclear Overhauser effect. [83,123- 13C2]-Mesobilirubin XIIIα (99%13C-enriched), its dimethyl ester and methyl [83- 13C]-xanthobilirubinate were prepared as described previously(17.Nogales D.F. Lightner D.A. J. Labelled Compds & Radiopharm. 1994; 34: 453-462Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The tetra-n-butylammonium salt was prepared as described previously (18.Pu Y.M. Lightner D.A. Tetrahedron. 1991; 47: 6163-6170Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) by suspending [83,123- 13C2]-mesobilirubin XIIIα (5.0 mg, 7.5 × 10−3 mmol) in dichloromethane (2 ml) and adding excess methanolic tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide (Aldrich) (15.0 μl of 1 M, 1.5 × 10−2 mmol). The solution was evaporated to dryness with a stream of dry N2, then dried overnight under vacuum (0.1 torr) over P2O5. NMR solutions ranging from 7.5 × 10−3 to 1.5 × 10−2M were prepared in deuterated solvents, CDCl3 or (CD3)2SO, obtained from Cambridge Isotope Labs. NMR solutions 3.5 × 10−3M in aqueous medium were prepared by dissolving the bis-tetra-n-butylammonium salt of 13CO2H-labeled mesobilirubin XIIIα in (CD3)2SO, then diluting with pH 7.4 0.1 M phosphate buffer to give a final solution with 30% (volumes) (CD3)2SO. The final pH is 7.4 and the concentration of (CD3)2SO in the aqueous buffer is 3.8 M (for a molar ratio of ∼15:1, H2O:(CD3)2SO). All experiments were performed on a General Electric GN-300 NMR spectrometer. All samples were degassed with argon and shielded from light. T1 measurements of the 13C-labeled pigments were performed by the inversion recovery method. All 75.58-MHz 13C spectra were collected using a 90° pulse width of 18.0 s. The 13C spectra was obtained coupled, with a minimum of 256 scans and a pulse delay of 20 s (4 times T1). The printed carbon resonances were digitized using Un-Plot-It and the areas were determined by the Un-Plot-It software. No further data manipulation was performed on the raw data. 13C{1H} Heteronuclear NOEs were determined by pulse techniques developed previously(19.Neuhaus D Williamson M. The Nuclear Overhauser Effect in Structural and Conformational Analysis. VCH Publishers, New York1988Google Scholar, 20.Khaled M.A. Watkins C.L. J. Am. Chem.

The semiquantitative NOE values (an average of three to five independent determinations and reported as average percent NOE) were determined by subtracting integrated areas of the 13COOH off-resonance from the 13COOH resonance observed during selective 1H saturation irradiation then divided by the resonance peak area. For NOE determinations in aqueous buffer, a 1331 water suppression experiment was used in order to reduce the 1H NMR signal due to H2O(25.Hore P.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 54: 539-542Google Scholar). Normal 1H saturation experiments could not be used due to the exchange of the N-H's with solvent. The 1331 technique does not reduce the magnitude of the H2O signal in the NMR; rather, it applies a wave to the spectrum where no data points are taken in the region of the H2O resonances. Data points are taken on each side of the H2O resonance. Approximate non-bonded 1H to 13C interatomic distances were calculated from the NOE results by calibration to a known 1H to 13C reference distance: in our work, the 13C to α-H distance (2.12 Å) in the propionic acid segment, -C(β)H2-C(α)H2- 13COOH. The formula (20.Khaled M.A. Watkins C.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 3363-3365Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) used for relating NOE to distance is,(rC-H)(non-bonded) = (rC-H)(ref.)×{{}13C{ 1H}NOE (ref).{}13C{ 1H} NOE (non-bonded)}where r is the non-bonded distance between the 13COOH carbon and the proton of interest, (rC-H) (ref.) = 2.12 Å and 13C{1H} (ref.) = 38% between the α-H to carboxylic acid carbon. The α-H to CO2H carbon distance is constant for either α-H and is fixed by the H-Cα and Cα-C(=O) bond distances and the H-Cα-C angle. These vary only insignificantly in propionic acid. In CDCl3 solvent, the two α-hydrogens have distinctly different chemical shifts. Irradiation of either gives exactly the same 13C{1H} NOE (38%), and that value was used for estimating the N-H •••13C(=O) non-bonded distances of this study according to the equation above. In NMR spectroscopy, the NOE occurs when the net intensities of resonances change while a selected resonance is perturbed by saturation or inversion. Its importance lies primarily in the fact that the resonances which change their intensities are those from spin systems that lie close to those directly affected by the perturbation(19.Neuhaus D Williamson M. The Nuclear Overhauser Effect in Structural and Conformational Analysis. VCH Publishers, New York1988Google Scholar, 26.James T.L. Basus V.J. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1991; 42: 501-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This means that when the non-bonded distance between two hydrogens is small, irradiation of one hydrogen can lead to an enhanced signal for the other. With appropriate calibration non-bonded interatomic distances may be calculated from NOE measurements(19.Neuhaus D Williamson M. The Nuclear Overhauser Effect in Structural and Conformational Analysis. VCH Publishers, New York1988Google Scholar, 27.Liu H. Kumar A. Weisz K. Schmitz U. Bishop K.D. James T.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 1590-1591Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Such homonuclear NOE's have been seen in bilirubin between the dipyrrinone pyrrole and lactam hydrogens(13.Kaplan D. Navon G. Isr. J. Chem. 1983; 23: 177-186Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which lie some 2 Å apart and between the C-5 H and C-7 CH3, and between the C-15 H and C-13 CH3 which lie some 3 Å apart. They have provided evidence for the syn-Z configuration in the dipyrrinones of bilirubin in solution (28.Kaplan, D., Navon, G. (1981) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II, 1374–1383Google Scholar) and for conformational enantioselection forced by non-bonded steric effects in bilirubin analogs with methyl groups on the α or β sites on the propionic acid chains(29.Puzicha G. Pu Y-M. Lightner D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 3583-3592Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30.Boiadjiev S.E. Person R.V. Puzicha G. Knobler C. Maverick E. Trueblood K.N. Lightner D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10123-10133Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although NOE studies are most common in 1H{1H} homo-NOE experiments, they are not limited to such and have been expanded to include more complicated heteronuclear experiments, especially those involving 1H with 13C resonances (21.Yu C. Levy G.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 6533-6537Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar) or 1H and 31P resonances(21.Yu C. Levy G.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 6533-6537Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Recently, heteronuclear 13C{1H} NOE measurements have played a major role in detecting hydrogen bonds (1H•••O= 13C) and determining the secondary structure of peptides and oligonucleotides(19.Neuhaus D Williamson M. The Nuclear Overhauser Effect in Structural and Conformational Analysis. VCH Publishers, New York1988Google Scholar, 20.Khaled M.A. Watkins C.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 3363-3365Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22.Mukundan Jr., S. Xu Y. Zon G. Marzilli L.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 3021-3027Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In even simpler systems, (E)- and (Z)-stereoisomers of 4(α-arylethylidene)-2-phenyl-5(4H)-oxazolones could be distinguished by 13C{1H} NOE measurements (23.Cativela C. Sánchez-Ferrando F. Magn. Res. Chem. 1985; 23: 1072-1075Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), while hydrogen bonding of water to 2-pyridones has been studied by 13C{1H} two-dimensional NOE spectroscopy (24.Seba, H. B., Ancian, B. (1990) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 996–997Google Scholar). In an especially relevant example, 13C{1H} heteronuclear NOE measurements on valinomycin were used to identify the amide carbonyl and NH partners involved in the intramolecular hydrogen bonding that preserves its secondary structure(20.Khaled M.A. Watkins C.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 3363-3365Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In our 13C{1H} NOE study of 13CO2H-labeled mesobilirubin, in either deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) or deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide ((CD3)2SO) solvents, saturation irradiation of either the pyrrole or lactam N-H's led to an enhancement of the 13COOH signal in the 13C NMR. The results are shown in Fig. 3 and provide the first clear evidence that the N-H and 13CO2H groups of bilirubin in solution lie very close to one another. The non-bonded H to C (N-H to 13COOH) distances calculated from the observed NOE's in CDCl3 are very nearly the same as those found in crystals of bilirubin, where the pigment has been shown to adopt an intramolecularly hydrogen bonded ridge-tile conformation(11.Bonnett R. Davies J.E. Hursthouse M.B. Sheldrick G.M. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1978; 202: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 12.LeBas G. Allegret A. Mauguen Y. DeRango C. Bailly M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B. 1980; B36: 3007-3011Crossref Google Scholar). They are also very nearly the same as those found in the global minimum energy conformation of bilirubin and mesobilirubin XIIIα by molecular dynamics calculations (31.Person R.V. Peterson B.R. Lightner D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 42-59Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The pigment in CDCl3 solvent is thus shown by 13C{1H} NOE spectroscopy to adopt the hydrogen-bonded ridge-tile conformation. The 13C{1H} NOE's seen in (CD3)2SO solvent are somewhat smaller than those found in CDCl3 (Fig. 3A), indicating a slightly longer distance (Table 1) between pyrrole and lactam N-H's and the 13COOH. The data suggest that dimethyl sulfoxide does not completely break the matrix of intramolecular hydrogen bonds but only slightly weakens the hydrogen-bonded ridge-tile conformation, as suggested earlier by 13C NMR T1 relaxation times of the carbons in the propionic acid chains (13.Kaplan D. Navon G. Isr. J. Chem. 1983; 23: 177-186Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15.Kaplan D. Navon G. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32.Shout D.P.

Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 8189-8198Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In strong contrast, no 13C{1H} NOE's (<0.1) are found between the N-H's and 13CO2CH3 groups of [83,123- 13C2]-mesobilirubin XIIIα dimethyl ester. The data suggest large distances between the dipyrrinone N-H groups and the propionic ester carbonyl carbon, providing no support for an intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded conformation in either chloroform or dimethyl sulfoxide. Although bilirubin dimethyl ester is thought to be monomeric in the latter solvent, in the former a dimer is favored, as shown by vapor phase osmometry(35.Falk H. The Chemistry of Linear Oligopyrroles and Bile Pigments. Springer Verlag, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). Do intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded conformations of bilirubin persist when the propionic acid groups are ionized to carboxylate anions? The answer is apparently yes, as learned from 13C{1H} NOE measurements on the bis-tetra-n-butylammonium salts of [83,123- 13C2]-mesobilirubin XIIIα (Fig. 4). In CDCl3 solvent, the NOE enhancements found are comparably strong to those observed from the free acid; whereas, in (CD3)2SO solvent the NOE enhancements are somewhat larger than in the free acid. It would appear that bilirubin carboxylate anions are just as tightly hydrogen-bonded in chloroform solution as the free acids. And in dimethyl sulfoxide solution the dicarboxylate anions are probably even more strongly hydrogen bonded than the free acids. The data suggest that in the free acid dimethyl sulfoxide solvent is more attracted to the carboxylic acid OH group than to the dipyrrinone N-H's. Is bilirubin in pH 7.4 aqueous buffer intramolecularly hydrogen bonded? When [83,123- 13C2]-mesobilirubin XIIIα is dissolved in a small quantity of (CD3)2SO and diluted with 0.1 M pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, the 13C NMR resonance for the propionic carboxyl (δ 181.9 ppm downfield from (CH3)4Si standard) is observed at the same position (δ 181.9 ppm) as in a solution where the bis-tetra-n-butylammonium salt is similarly dissolved. The carboxyl resonance is thus apparently insensitive to the cation used (tetra-n-butylammonium versus sodium or potassium) for the carboxylate anion. When the bis-tetra-n-butylammonium salt is dissolved in H2O, 10% D2O (no (CD3)2SO) at pH 8.0 or 11.0, the carboxyl resonance appears at essentially the same shielding, δ 182.5 and 182.4, respectively. Since the carboxyl 13C NMR resonances of carboxylic acids are known to be sensitive to ionization (δ 181.5 for acetate ion versus 176.8 for acetic acid)(36.Cistola D.P. Small D.M. Hamilton J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 795-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the observed resonances for our bilirubin analog are consistent with predominantly ionized (carboxylate ion) species at pH 8, 11, and even 7.4. The 13C{1H} NOE's observed for [83,123- 13C2]-mesobilirubin XIIIα in pH 7.4 aqueous phosphate buffer containing 3.8 M (CD3)2SO (Fig. 5) are significant and meaningful. Although smaller than those seen for the anion in either CDCl3 or pure (CD3)2SO, they are comparable to those seen for the acid in (CD3)2SO. The weaker NOE's are consistent with a somewhat more open or flatter ridge-tile conformation, and the computed N-H to 13C=O distance is still within the range found for long hydrogen bonds (1H•••O= 13C). The data are summarized in Table 1. The results of the 13C{1H} NOE study on [83,123- 13C2]-mesobilirubin XIIIα and its bispropionate anion indicate that the carboxylic acid and carboxylate anion carbons are sufficiently close to the dipyrrinone pyrrole and lactam N-H groups to produce an NOE, but the carboxylic ester carbon is not. The larger NOEs are found in the more lipophilic solvent (CDCl3) as might be expected, where the calculated pyrrole/lactam N-H to 13COOH non-bonded H to C distances are essentially the same as those computed by molecular dynamics or found in crystals of bilirubin. As might also be expected, the smaller NOEs are found in the more polar solvents, (CD3)2SO and H2O, where solvent is thought to interfere with the intramolecular hydrogen bonds. What is surprising, perhaps, is that the NOEs are found in all of these solvents. The data clearly indicate, however, that in the acid, and even in the propionate anion, the carboxyl group lies close to the dipyrrinone NH groups. In fact, the computed distance between the carboxyl carbon and dipyrrinone N-H's lies within the distance of a long hydrogen bond, either N-H•••O= 13C(-OH) or N-H•••O= 13C(-O−) ↔ N-H•••−O- 13C(=O). These results are important because they reveal the persistence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in bilirubin and its anions, in organic (CDCl3, (CD3)2SO) solvents, and in water. They suggest a way to learn the conformation of bilirubin in lipids, on proteins, or in intact cells or other biological tissues using 13C{1H} heteronuclear NOE measurements. They indicate that key steps in bilirubin metabolism, such as glucuronidation, might be followed by 13C NMR spectroscopy. They also suggest that bilirubin pKa values in microenvironments might be determined from the 13CO2H-labeled pigment. We sincerely thank Lewis Cary for help with the NMR experiments and D. Timothy Anstine for help in determining non-bonded distances by molecular dynamics calculations."

Two human liver SSADH cDNA clones of 1091 and 899 base pairs were also isolated. Human and rat SSADH share 83 and 91% identity in nucleotide and protein sequence, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed two differentially expressed SSADH transcripts of approximately 2.0 and 6.0 kilobases in both rat and human tissues. Human genomic Southern blots indicate that the two SSADH transcripts are encoded by a greater than 20-kilobase single copy gene. Mammalian SSADH contains significant homology to bacterial NADP+-succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.16) and conserved regions of general aldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.3), suggesting it is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily of proteins. The metabolism of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA 1The abbreviations are: GABAγ-aminobutyric acidGABA-Tγ-aminobutyric acid transaminaseSSAsuccinic semialdehydeSSADHsuccinic semialdehyde dehydrogenasebpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s)PCRpolymerase chain reaction.is carried out by three enzymes (Fig. 1). Glutamic acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15) converts glutamic acid to GABA with stoichiometric production of carbon dioxide. GABA degradation is achieved in a two-step reaction, catalyzed by GABA-transaminase (GABA-T; EC 2.6.1.19) and NAD+-dependent succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH; EC 1.2.1.24). The carbon skeleton of GABA thus enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the form of succinate. Of these three enzymes, mammalian cDNAs have been isolated for both glutamic acid decarboxylase and GABA-T from different sources, including mouse, pig, and human(1.Huang W.-M. Reed-Fourquet L. Wu E.

SSADH, the final enzyme in GABA catabolism, has been purified to apparent homogeneity from rat and human brain(5.Chambliss K.L. Gibson K.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6.Ryzlak M.T. Pietruszko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 266: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SSADH is also the site of an inborn error of human metabolism(7.Jakobs C. Jaeken J. Gibson K.M. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 704-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In autosomal recessively inherited SSADH deficiency, now identified in more than 45 patients who manifest varying degrees of psychomotor retardation with speech delay, the normal oxidative pathway is blocked, thereby resulting in the accumulation of succinic semialdehyde (SSA). Metabolite patterns in physiologic fluids derived from patients show large increases in 4-hydroxybutyric acid, the reduction product of SSA. The biochemical hallmark of SSADH deficiency, 4-hydroxybutyric acid, produces central nervous system effects including altered motor activity and behavior disturbances when administered to animals and humans at pharmacologic levels(8.Snead O.C. Neurology. 1978; 28: 636-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the nucleotide sequence of bacterial NADP+-linked SSADH (EC 1.2.1.16) has recently been presented(9.Niegemann E. Schulz A. Bartsch K. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a cDNA encoding mammalian NAD+-dependent SSADH has not been reported. We present the isolation of cDNAs encoding SSADH from rat and human and the expression of the rat SSADH cDNAs in bacteria. SSADH cDNAs from both species recognize two differentially expressed mRNAs of approximately 2.0 and 6.0 kb that are transcribed from a single gene. These cDNAs will be useful tools with which to begin investigating the molecular genetics of inherited human SSADH deficiency. The availability of cDNAs encoding GABA-T and SSADH from mammalian sources will enable studies to determine if both genes are coordinately regulated, as has been demonstrated in yeast(10.André B. Jauniaux J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A rat forebrain λZAP cDNA library (randomly primed) and a rat cerebellum λZAP cDNA library (oligo(dT)-primed) were obtained from the Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory of The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA. A λZAP human liver cDNA library (oligo(dT)-primed) was purchased from Stratagene. Northern blots containing 2 μg of polyadenylated mRNA from various rat and human tissues were purchased from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Other materials were purchased from the manufacturer's as follows: custom-synthesized gel-purified oligonucleotides, National Biosciences; Sequenase DNA sequencing kit, U. S.

All chemicals were of the highest purity obtainable. Rat and human brain SSADH were purified as reported previously(5.Chambliss K.L. Gibson K.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). N-terminal protein sequencing was performed on gel-purified protein with an Applied Biosystems model 470A amino acid sequencer with on-line model 120A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. To obtain additional amino acid sequence, the rat brain SSADH protein was digested with trypsin and cyanogen bromide and resulting peptides were isolated on an Applied Biosystems model 130A narrow-bore high performance liquid chromatography system and sequenced. The mixed oligonucleotides primed amplification of cDNA procedure was used to generate a DNA probe for library screening. First strand cDNA was synthesized with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase using a downstream antisense primer (GCNCCNGCNGCNGG(A/G)TC) according to the protocol of Kawasaki(11.Kawasaki E.S. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 21-27Google Scholar). Thirty cycles of PCR were performed on the cDNA using the upstream primer GGGAATTCGTNGGNGGNCCNGCNGA and the above downstream primer with annealing for 45 s at 42°C, extension for 1 min at 72°C, and denaturing for 45 s at 94°C. A second round of PCR was carried out using 1 μl of the first PCR as template. The same upstream primer was used, but a nested downstream primer with the sequence GGAAGCTTGG(A/G)TC(A/G)TANACNGG(A/G)AA replaced the previous downstream primer. The same temperature profile and cycle number were employed. The PCR product of 117 bp was gel-purified with glass milk and subcloned into the Bluescript II SK+ vector using the EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites engineered onto the ends of the primers. Six isolates of the clone were sequenced with Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit according to the manufacturer's protocols for the sequencing of double-stranded DNA. The SSADH PCR clone was excised from the Bluescript vector with EcoRI and HindIII, gel-purified with glass milk, and labeled with [α- 32P]CTP and [α- 32P]ATP with a random-primed labeling kit from Amersham Corp. according to suggested procedures to a specific activity > 5 × 108 cpm/μg. The labeled fragment was purified on Sephadex G-50, denatured at 100°C, and used as a probe to screen > 106 plaques from a λZAP rat forebrain library according to standard protocols provided by Amersham for use with Hybond-N+ nylon filters. One-hour prehybridization and overnight hybridization were done in 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE = 0.15 M NaCl, 0.25 M NaH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA), 5 × Denhardt's solution (1 × Denhardt's = 0.2% (w/v) Ficoll, 0.2% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin fraction V), 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 20 μg/ml yeast tRNA. Filters were washed two times for 10 min at room temperature in 2 × SSPE with 0.1% (w/v) SDS and twice for 15 min at 65°C in 1 × SSPE with 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Positive plaques were purified through two additional cycles of screening. Positive inserts were subcloned into the Bluescript SK− plasmid vector by the “in vivo excision” and recircularization process as described by Stratagene and sequenced as described above using XbaI and BglII restriction sites for subcloning. More than 1.5 × 106 plaques of a human liver λZAP cDNA library were screened using the 1465-bp rat forebrain SSADH clone as the probe. Hybridizations, clone isolation, and sequencing were performed as described for rat brain SSADH clones. DNA sequence was determined for both strands by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method(12.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed with the Sequenase modified T7 DNA polymerase following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA sequences which could not be reached from vector priming sites were subcloned using the XbaI and BglII restriction endonuclease sites present within the cDNA clones. Additional primers were synthesized to sequence all regions. DNA and protein sequences were aligned and compared using the Genepro and Align computer programs. Sequences were compared with the GenBank sequences using the Atlas computer program. Genomic DNA was isolated from human lymphocytes by the method of Steffen et al.(13.Steffen D. Bird S. Rowe W.P. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4554-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 10 μg of the genomic DNA was digested separately with BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, and XbaI, separated on a 0.7% agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane. DNA was cross-linked to the membrane by alkaline fixation as described by Amersham. The membrane was prehybridized and hybridized in Rapid-hyb blotting buffer from Amersham at 65°C for the recommended times. The blot was probed with the 1091-bp human liver SSADH cDNA fragment which was random-primed labeled with [α- 32P]dCTP and [α- 32P]dATP to a specific activity >5 × 108 cpm/μg and hybridizing bands were visualized by autoradiography with Kodak XAR film. The probe was stripped from the blot by boiling in 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and the membrane was reprobed with a 279-bp BglII-EcoRI fragment from the 3′-end of the human liver cDNA using the same conditions. Poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated from various rat and human tissues and 2 μg of each were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels containing 1.1% formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes by Clontech. The membranes were prehybridized and hybridized in Amersham's Rapid-hyb buffer as described for Southern blots. The 1091-bp human liver SSADH cDNA EcoRI fragment was used to probe human multiple tissue and brain Northern blots. The 1465-bp rat brain SSADH cDNA containing most of the coding region and part of the 3′-untranslated region was used to probe the rat multiple tissue Northern blot. The rat multiple tissue Northern blot was stripped of this probe by boiling in 0.5% (w/v) SDS and reprobed with a 2-kb XbaI fragment containing mostly downstream 3′-untranslated DNA sequence from the 3.5-kb rat brain SSADH cDNA. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from approximately 5 × 108 lymphoblast cells which had been grown in OptiMem liquid media supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum. 20 μg of the poly(A)+ RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde. The RNA was electroblotted to Hybond-N+ membrane, prehybridized and hybridized according to manufacturer's protocols using the human liver 1091-bp SSADH cDNA as probe. All Northern blots (except lymphoblast) were stripped of their respective probes and reprobed with a human β-actin clone provided by Clontech. The enzyme assay was modified from the procedures of Manthey et al.(14.Manthey C.L. Landkamer G.J. Sladek N.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4991-5002PubMed Google Scholar) and Chambliss and Gibson (5.Chambliss K.L. Gibson K.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The standard enzyme assay contained 0.1 M sodium pyrophosphate buffer (pH 9.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, 500 μM NAD, and 20 μM succinic semialdehyde. Measurements of initial reaction velocity were carried out spectrophotometrically at 340 nm and 25°C in 3 ml total volume. The components in blank assays were identical except that SSA was omitted. The reaction was started by addition of SSA, and the increase in the optical density at 340 nm was measured for 2-10 min. The extinction coefficient of NADH used was 6.22 mM−1 cm−1 at 340 nm. The data of initial reaction velocities showed that reaction rates were proportional to protein concentration. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(15.Lowry O.O. Rosebrough H.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Two composite rat brain SSADH cDNA clones were constructed by ligating the PCR amplified 117-bp sequence (encoding the mature N terminus) onto the 5′-end of the 3.5-kb and the 1465-bp rat brain SSADH partial cDNAs using the NotI restriction site at base pair 55 (Fig. 3). The EcoRI fragment of the composite clones was then transferred into the EcoRI site of the glutathione S-transferase fusion vector pGEX-5X-1 (Pharmacia). DH5α E. coli were transformed and grown overnight at 37°C in TB media (12 g of Bacto-tryptone, 24 g of Bacto-yeast extract, 2 g of casamino acids/liter). The next day, 95 ml of TB media supplemented with 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1 ml of 50% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 5 ml of the overnight culture and grown at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm for two h. Gene expression was induced by addition of isopropylthio-β-D-galactoside to a final concentration of 1 mM, and the cultures were grown at 28°C overnight with gentle shaking. The cells were pelleted at 1500 × g and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1 M sodium pyrophosphate buffer, pH 9.0, 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and sonicated for 2 min while chilled in an ice bath. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were assayed for SSADH activity as described above. A rat brain extract was prepared in the same buffer and assayed as an additional parallel control. The rat brain SSADH N-terminal peptide sequence (VGGPADLHADLLRGDSFVGGRWLPTPA) and an overlapping tryptic fragment (WLPTPATFPVYDPASGAK) provided information for designing oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification. Reverse transcription of rat brain total RNA followed by PCR amplification was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and produced a single product of 117 base pairs. The amplified DNA was cloned and several isolates were sequenced and shown to encode the exact amino acids predicted from the peptide sequence of this region. Two rat brain SSADH cDNAs were isolated after screening approximately 106 clones from a rat forebrain λZAP cDNA library with the 117-bp rat brain SSADH PCR product. The sizes of the cDNA inserts in these clones were 1465 and 1135 base pairs. Complete DNA sequencing of the clones revealed that the 1135- and 1465-bp clones were 100% homologous, with the larger clone having 24 more bases 5′ and 306 more bases 3′ than the 1135 bp clone (Fig. 2). The DNA sequence contained an open reading frame which included most of the known amino acid sequence obtained from sequencing the mature SSADH protein (Fig. 3). The 1465-bp cDNA began at the 8th amino acid after the mature N terminus of the SSADH protein and contained 106 bp of the 3′-untranslated region, including an AATAAA polyadenylation signal 92 bp upstream from the end of the cDNA. Only 6 amino acid residues from a tryptic peptide sequence were not found in the cDNA. The deduced molecular weight of a polypeptide comprised of amino acids from the mature N terminus through the end of the open reading frame was 48,854 daltons. The 1465-bp insert was used to screen a second rat brain λZAP cDNA library in an attempt to isolate a more complete cDNA. One additional clone was obtained from a screen of approximately 106 clones. This clone had a cDNA insert of approximately 3.5 kb. Restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing of the clone revealed a 5′-end which began 12 bp downstream from the 1465-bp clone and a 3′-tail with approximately 2 kb of additional 3′-untranslated DNA as compared with the 1465-bp clone (Fig. 2). The 3.5-kb clone had 100% homology with aligned regions of the 1465-bp clone with the exception of an additional 84-bp insert 214 bp from the 5′-end of the 3.5-kb clone that was not present in the other two cDNAs (Fig. 3). This insert encoded 28 additional amino acids, starting at amino acid 72, and included the 6 amino acids from the sequenced tryptic fragment that were not present in the 1465-bp cDNA. The presence of a consensus splice site at the insertion position suggests that the extra sequence in the 3.5-kb clone is due to an alternative RNA splicing mechanism. The deduced molecular mass of the protein encoded by this clone was 52,188 daltons, which was in good agreement with the estimated molecular weight of 54,000 for purified rat brain SSADH(5.Chambliss K.L. Gibson K.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A human liver λZAP cDNA library was screened with the 1465-bp rat brain SSADH cDNA. Approximately 106 clones were screened and two positive clones were isolated. The cDNA inserts of these clones were 1091 and 899 bp. Complete sequencing and comparison of the clones revealed identical 3′-ends and 100% homology, with the longer clone extending 192 bp further upstream than the shorter (Fig. 2). The 1091-bp human clone contained a 972-bp open reading frame and 119-bp 3′-untranslated tail with an AATAAA consensus polyadenylation signal 45 bp from the end of the cDNA (Fig. 3). Comparison of the human liver SSADH cDNA with the rat brain SSADH cDNAs revealed an 83% identity at the DNA level over the coding region and 91% homology at the amino acid level. Most of the observed base changes occurred at the third position of codons and do not result in a change of the amino acid residue. Many of the amino acid differences are due to the change of a single base within the codon. Northern blot analysis of mRNA from rat and human tissues revealed two differentially expressed transcripts of approximately 2.0 and 6.0 kb (Fig. 4, A and B). Some tissues such as brain and pancreas express predominantly the 6.0-kb transcript with relatively low amounts of the 2.0-kb transcript. Other tissues such as heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and human kidney have appreciable amounts of both transcripts. Human placenta and rat spleen, lung, kidney, and testis have only trace amounts of either transcript relative to other tissues. No tissues examined expressed the 2.0-kb transcript alone. Analysis of mRNA from different regions of human brain showed a consistent level of expression of the two SSADH transcripts throughout that organ (Fig. 4C). Northern blot analysis of cultured lymphoblasts showed expression of both the 2.0- and 6.0-kb transcripts (Fig. 4D). Size considerations suggested that the 3.5-kb rat brain SSADH cDNA was produced from the 6.0-kb SSADH transcript. To verify this, the multiple tissue Northern blots were stripped and reprobed with a radiolabeled DNA fragment containing only the 3′-terminal 2-kb tail of the 3.5-kb cDNA. Only the 6.0-kb SSADH transcript hybridized with this 3′-fragment (data not shown). To verify that the isolated cDNAs encoded a protein with SSADH activity, two composite clones were constructed which included the PCR amplified mature N terminus coding region ligated to the 3.5-kb and 1465-bp rat brain SSADH cDNAs. The larger clone constructed with the 3.5-kb cDNA contained the 84 bp (28 amino acid) insert near the 5′-end, whereas the shorter clone did not contain the insert. The composite clones were placed in frame into a pGEX-5X bacterial expression vector. Table 1 shows results of the expression of these glutathione S-transferase-SSADH fusion composite clones as well as a control clone that was not in frame and parent vector alone. Bacterial homogenates made from cells with in frame composite rat brain SSADH clones displayed an approximate 300-fold greater SSADH activity when the 84-bp insert was present and an approximate 150-fold greater SSADH activity without the insert in comparison to homogenates made from cells containing vector only or the inverted larger composite clone.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To estimate the size of the genomic SSADH gene and to establish whether the two SSADH transcripts were from one gene or two different genes, genomic Southern hybridization was performed. Genomic DNA was isolated from human lymphocytes and digested with four separate restriction endonucleases. Southern blot hybridization studies using the 1091-bp human SSADH cDNA as probe revealed several restriction fragments with each endonuclease used and indicated that the SSADH gene covers at least 20 kb in the human genome (Fig. 5). Upon reprobing with a 296-bp radiolabeled fragment from the 3′-end of the human SSADH cDNA (containing 172 bp of C-terminal coding region), a single restriction fragment was detected in each digest. This data suggests that human SSADH is a single copy gene. Human and rat SSADH share substantial homology to the recently presented E. coli gabD gene, an NADP+-dependent succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.16) (9.Niegemann E. Schulz A. Bartsch K. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). Human and rat SSADH share 56 and 54% homology, respectively, to this protein. A search of the GenBank reveals that human and rat NAD+-dependent SSADH described in this paper and the bacterial NADP+-dependent SSADH also share 36-38% homology at the protein level to mammalian general aldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.3) and 36% homology with bacterial 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. SSADH shares only slight amino acid homology to other bacterial semialdehyde dehydrogenases, including glutaric semialdehyde dehydrogenase, N-acetylglutamate- γ-semialdehyde dehydrogenase and aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenase at 18, 15, and 10%, respectively. We report the sequence of cDNAs encoding the mature form (minus the mitochondrial entry sequence) of rat brain SSADH and a significant amount (323 amino acids) of the coding region of human liver SSADH. The clones were confirmed by matching deduced amino acid sequence of the rat brain cDNA with 120 amino acid residues sequenced from the N terminus and seven different peptides of the purified rat brain protein and by expression of composite clones encoding the mature rat brain protein. Although rat and human NAD+-dependent SSADH share greater than 50% homology with NADP+-dependent SSADH of E. coli, these enzymes represent two different classes of semialdehyde dehydrogenases. The sequence of the bacterial NAD+-dependent SSADH, the product of the sad gene, has not been reported. Alignment of SSADH with other aldehyde and semialdehyde dehydrogenases reveals greater homology with cytosolic and mitochondrial general aldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.3) than with most other semialdehyde dehydrogenases, except the bacterial NADP+-SSADH described above and 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. SSADH possesses many of the conserved residues found among aldehyde dehydrogenases. Glycines 245 and 250 of cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase are believed to play a role in NAD+ binding and correspond to glycines 237 and 242 of rat SSADH. The consensus active site motif (SAG)XFXXXGQXCX(AGN) containing the important Cys-302 (16.Hempel J.D. Pietruszko R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10889-10896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is present in SSADH at residues 282 through 297. General aldehyde dehydrogenases have been shown to contain a conserved VTLELGGK motif at amino acids 265-274 which was identified by inactivation with bromoacetophenone(17.Abriola D.P. Fields R. Stein S. MacKerell Jr., A.D. Pietruszko R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5679-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The SSADH enzymes have a 5 of 8 match to this sequence with maintenance of the putative active site Glu-268 (Glu-259 in rat SSADH). Most other sequenced aldehyde dehydrogenases contain an EEIFGP sequence near their C-terminal end, whereas the deduced amino acid sequences of the three SSADH proteins have a new version of this conserved sequence EETFGP. These consensus sequences, and others, clearly identify SSADH as a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily. Northern and Southern blot data reveal two SSADH messages which are transcribed from a single gene. The larger transcript of rat was shown to have a much longer 3′-untranslated tail (at least 2 kb) presumably due to the selection of a different 3′-processing and polyadenylation site. Because no cDNAs were found that contained the 5′-end of an SSADH transcript, it is not known whether the two messages share the same transcriptional start point; however, it seems unlikely, based upon size considerations of RNA transcripts and isolated cDNAs. Also, the two transcripts are expressed at varying ratios in the different tissues examined; however, no tissue expresses only the 2.0-kb transcript. Another difference in SSADH transcripts appears to be the presence or absence of an 84-base pair segment capable of encoding 28 amino acids. We know that the purified rat brain SSADH protein was translated from a transcript that contained the 84-bp segment, because 6 deduced amino acid residues encoded by this segment correspond to 6 amino acid residues of a sequenced tryptic peptide. It remains possible that the absence of the segment is an artifact of the reverse transcription and subsequent cloning steps in library construction; however, there are several observations which suggest that the lack of the segment is not an artifact. First, two separate and unique cDNA clones lack the 84-bp segment, and both of these clones have identical sequences at the site where the segment is missing. Also, the site of insertion of the segment is flanked by a consensus splice site motif (AG/G), and the reading frame of the protein is preserved both with and without the segment. Last, bacterial expression analysis shows high levels of SSADH activity in composite cDNA clones with and without the 84-bp segment. It is possible that the 84-bp segment is unique to the 6.0-kb SSADH transcript, since the rat brain cDNA clone that contains the segment was reverse transcribed from the larger transcript (known because of the long 3′-tail); however, the absolute presence (or absence) of the 84-bp segment in the different SSADH transcripts is still under investigation. An important question that remains is why the two SSADH mRNAs are at different ratios in the various tissues. Although they may encode two different subunits of SSADH, most of our data in rat argue in favor of a single subunit comprising the SSADH protein. We observe a single protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels of purified rat brain SSADH, and we detect only one cross-reactive band on Western blots of tissue homogenates(5.Chambliss K.L. Gibson K.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18.Chambliss K.L. Lee C.F. Ogier H. Rabier D. Jakobs C. Gibson K.M. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Also, our expression data show that an enzymatically active SSADH protein can be formed from a single subunit encoded by a cDNA transcribed from the 2.0- or 6.0-kb transcript. Also in support of the single subunit theory is the observation that rat brain SSADH can be resolved to a single band by isoelectric focusing, suggesting one isozyme(5.Chambliss K.L. Gibson K.M. Int.

Although the composite cDNAs reported here encode the mature and functionally active rat brain SSADH protein, we were unable to obtain a full-length cDNA containing the 5′-untranslated region and encoding the mitochondrial signal sequence. Both screening of several rat and human cDNA libraries and attempts at rapid amplification of cDNA ends have thus far been unsuccessful. Similar results have been reported by other groups attempting to obtain the 5′-ends of aldehyde dehydrogenase cDNAs (20.Hsu L.C. Tani K. Fujiyoshi T. Kurachi K. Yoshida A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3771-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 21.Farres J. Guan K.-L. Weiner H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22.Kurys G.

The problem may be due to a high degree of secondary structure in the aldehyde dehydrogenase RNAs which lead to premature termination of cDNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase. All of the rat brain SSADH cDNA clones reported in this paper have a 5′ terminus within a 12-bp region which is a few codons downstream of the first codon of the mature protein. Primer extension analysis performed in this laboratory reveals a strong stop which maps to this region and further indicates secondary structure of the RNA at that site. This paper represents the first demonstration by Northern blot data of the presence of SSADH in non-neural tissues as well as neural tissue. Other groups have demonstrated SSA oxidizing activity in non-neural tissues; however, the presence in mammalian tissues of other aldehyde dehydrogenases which can oxidize SSA leaves doubt to the actual presence of SSADH, especially in tissues with low levels of activity. However, most tissues examined have some amount of SSADH message. In conjunction with the demonstration that GABA and GABA-T are located in a number of non-neural tissues(23.Erd ö S.L. Erd ö S.L. GABA Outside the CNS. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 97-110Crossref Google Scholar), our data would suggest that catabolism of GABA through GABA-T and SSADH is an active metabolic pathway in mammalian non-neural tissues. Isolation of rat and human cDNAs encoding SSADH are important steps to begin an analysis of the molecular genetics of SSADH deficiency. SSADH deficiency is believed to be caused by a mutation in the gene encoding SSADH. The information in the present report should be of value in isolating a full-length human cDNA encoding SSADH, which will be important for mutation studies in cells from affected individuals. Mutation analysis in SSADH deficiency may help to explain the pronounced clinical heterogeneity of the disease. We thank Dr. J. Boulter for the brain cDNA libraries and Terry Munn for assistance in GenBank sequence comparisons."
https://openalex.org/W1574841349,"X-ray crystal structures of IgG-Fc provide evidence of extensive noncovalent interactions between the protein and carbohydrate moieties, and glycosylation, at Asn-297 within the Fc, has been shown to be important for effector functions mediated through Fc gamma receptors expressed on leukocytes. We have applied protein engineering in an attempt to define protein/carbohydrate interactions essential to wild-type biological activity. We demonstrate that replacement of Lys-246, Asp-249, and Glu-258, which make contacts with GlcNac and Gal on the outer alpha[1-->6] arm, do not affect recognition of human chimeric IgG3 by human Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII. However, replacement of Asp-265, which make contacts with the primary GlcNac sugar residue and is covalently attached to Asn-297, resulted in loss of recognition of both Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII. Similarly, replacement of Asp-265 in mouse IgG2b resulted in loss of recognition by mouse Fc gamma RII. These results suggest that noncovalent contacts of Asp-265 with the primary GlcNac residue are important for maintenance of recognition of IgG by Fc gamma receptors whereas contacts with GlcNac and Gal on the alpha [1-->6] arm do not have a measurable effect. This conclusion was supported by experiments in which galactose-deficient and fully galactosylated forms of a human IgG4-Fc fragment were shown to be equivalent in their ability to inhibit superoxide generation by IgG4 stimulated U937 cells."

However, the structurally related F1F0 ATP synthase in Propionigenium modestum uses Na+ instead. The binding site for Na+ resides in the F0 sector of the P. modestum enzyme. We postulated that Na+ might interact with subunit c of F0. Subunit c of P. modestum and E. coli are reasonably homologous (19% identity) but show striking variations around the H+-translocating, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-reactive carboxyl (Asp61 in E. coli). Several hydrophobic residues around Asp61 were replaced with polar residues according to the P. modestum sequence in the hope that the polar replacements might provide liganding groups for Na+. One mutant from 31 different mutation combinations did generate an active enzyme that binds Li+, the combination being V60A, D61E, A62S, and I63T. Li+ binding was detected by Li+ inhibition of ATP-driven H+ transport, Li+ inhibition of F1F0-ATPase activity, and Li+ inhibition of F0-mediated H+ transport. The Li+ effects were observed with membrane vesicles prepared from a ΔnhaA, ΔnhaB mutant background which lacks Na+/H+ antiporters, and with purified, reconstituted preparations of F0 prepared from this background strain. Li+ inhibition was observed at pH 8.5 but not at pH 7.0. H+ thus appears to compete with Li+ for the binding site. Li+ binding was abolished by replacement of Glu61 by Asp or Ser62 by Ala. The side chains at Ala60 and Thr63may act in a supporting structural role by providing a more flexible conformation for the Li+ binding cavity. Thr63does not appear to provide a liganding group since H+ transport in two other mutants, with Gly or Ala in place of Thr63, was also inhibited by Li+. We suggest that a X-Glu-Ser-Y or X-Glu-Thr-Y sequence may provide a general structural motif for monovalent cation binding, and that the flexibility provided by residues X and Y will prove crucial to this structure.

Kinetic studies have shown that Ca2+/CaM activates CaN by increasing the Vmax, whereas Ca2+-binding to the B subunit decreases the Km and increases the Vmax.2 Thus, binding of Ca2+ to the B subunit is essential for enzymatic activity and for the cellular regulation of CaN. Studies on limited proteolysis of CaN in the absence of Ca2+/CaM demonstrated cleavage of the CaN A subunit NH2-terminal of the CaM-binding domain with retention of phosphatase activity and B subunit binding(12.Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This result demonstrated that the binding domain for the B subunit was located between the catalytic domain and the CaM-binding domain. Dissociation of the CaN A and B subunits requires buffer containing 6 M urea(13.Merat D.L. Hu Z.Y. Carter T.E. Cheung W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11053-11059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that hydrophobic interactions are important in the subunit association. Two regions (residues 347-357 and 363-372) whose hydrophobicity are highly conserved in CaN A isoforms from human to Drosophila are likely candidates for binding the B subunit. Using peptide chemistry, site-specific mutagenesis and enzymology, this paper identifies this region as important for B subunit interaction. The cDNA encoding the δ-isoform rat brain CaN A ( δ-CaN A) was introduced into SmaI- and EcoRI-digested pVL1393 transfer vector resulting in pVLCaN A(11.Perrino B.A. Fong Y.L. Brickey D.A. Saitoh Y.

The KpnI/SphI fragment of the cDNA for the δ-CaN A was inserted into M13mp18 to produce single-strand DNA for mutagenesis.

The Amersham oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis system (version 2.1) was used to generate mutant cDNAs. Mutant clones were isolated, and cDNA sequences were reconfirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Sequenase version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.)(14.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar). The mutant cDNAs were ligated into pVLCaN A and transfected into Sf9 cells. The BamHI/PstI fragment of the cDNA encoding rat brain CaN B was ligated into pVL1393 to generate pVLCaN B. The CaN 328-390 fragment was constructed by PCR from αδ-CaN A plus engineered BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. This fragment was subcloned into pGEX-2T vector which contains GST (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Sf9 cells were cotransfected with linear baculovirus DNA (In Vitrogen) and pVLCaN A or pVLCaN B. Recombinant baculovirus were identified by screening for occlusion-negative plaques, and expressed CaN A or CaN B was detected by Western blots of cell homogenates with rabbit anti-CaN A or anti-CaN A/B. Second-passage recombinant baculovirus was obtained and titered by end point dilution. Large scale protein expression of CaN A was done in 100-150-ml Corning spinner flasks at an initial cell density of 3 × 106 cells/ml and m.o.i. of 5. For co-expression of CaN A/B, the m.o.i. of CaN A and CaN B were 4 and 6, respectively. Purification procedures were performed as described previously except that the 100,000 × g centrifugation was omitted and protease inhibitors (0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg of leupeptin/liter, 5 mg of aprotinin/liter, and 5 mg of soybean trypsin inhibitor/liter) were added to the (NH4)2SO4 pellet(11.Perrino B.A. Fong Y.L.

The bacterial expressed myristylated CaN B was kindly provided by Dr. F. Rusnak (Mayo Foundation, Rochester, MN). All other materials and reagents were of the highest quality available from commercial suppliers. CaN A subunit sequences from Drosophila to human brain show a highly conserved region of unknown function between the catalytic domain and the CaM-binding domain (Fig. 1A). This CaN A sequence has two highly hydrophobic motifs (Fig. 1B), which may be involved in binding of the B subunit since dissociation of native CaN into its A and B subunits requires 6 M urea (13.Merat D.L. Hu Z.Y. Carter T.E. Cheung W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11053-11059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we expressed and purified a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and sequences 328-390 of CaN A (GST/A328-390). We tested the ability of residues 328-390 in this fusion protein to interact with CaN B by two independent techniques. Direct binding of CaN B to residues 328-390 was demonstrated in a mixture containing B subunit, fusion protein GST/A328-390, and glutathione-Sepharose. When this mixture was centrifuged and washed, the B subunit was bound to the fusion protein in the pellet (Fig. 2, lane 1). This interaction did not occur with just the GST protein alone (Fig. 2, lane 2), demonstrating that the B subunit was binding to residues 328-390. Furthermore, binding of CaN B to the GST/A328-390 was blocked by the presence of 10 μM synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 341-360 of CaN A (data not shown).Figure 2Binding of CaN B to residues 328-390 of CaN A. The CaN B subunit (1 μg) was incubated for 1 h at 4°C in 0.5 ml containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM CaCl2, 150 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, glutathione-Sepharose 4B (40 μl of 50% (v/v) slurry), and either 8 μg of fusion protein GST/A328-390 plus 8 μg of GST (lane 1) or 16 μg of GST (lane 2). The Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM CaCl2, 300 mM NaCl, resuspended in 50 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 3 min. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15%), stained by Coomassie Blue (panel A), or transferred to PVDF membrane and immunoblotted with anti-CaN B antibody (panel B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since CaN A residues 328-390 bind CaN B subunit, GST/A328-390 should block the in vitro interaction between the CaN A and B subunits. In agreement with our previous study(11.Perrino B.A. Fong Y.L. Brickey D.A. Saitoh Y. Ushio Y. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15965-15969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the low phosphatase activity of baculovirus/Sf9-expressed CaN A subunit (8 nmol/min/mg, Fig. 3A) was greatly enhanced (300-350 nmol/min/mg, Fig. 3A) after in vitro reconstitution with the B subunit (Fig. 3A). When the CaN A and B subunits were co-expressed in Sf9 cells, the purified CaN had an activity of about 700 nmol/min/mg CaN A, and purified brain CaN had an activity of 410 nmol/min/mg CaN A under the same assay conditions(11.Perrino B.A. Fong Y.L.

Thus, reconstitution with the B subunit resulted in a 40-fold increase in the phosphatase activity of the A subunit to a value equivalent to purified brain CaN and about half that of co-expressed CaN. However, increasing concentrations of GST/A328-390 inhibited this in vitro reconstitution with an IC 50 of 50-100 nM (Fig. 3B). This represents potent inhibition since the concentrations of CaN A and B subunits were each 30 nM. Inhibition by GST/A328-390 was specific since 1) GST alone was without effect (Fig. 3B), and 2) addition of 600 nM fusion protein to co-expressed CaN A/B gave a small stimulation of phosphatase activity (not shown). The above results demonstrated that residues 328-390 in the CaN A subunit bind CaN B subunit. Since binding of the A and B subunits probably involves hydrophobic interactions and peptide 341-360 blocked binding of B subunit, we mutated two clusters of hydrophobic residues within CaN A 341-360: Val349-Phe350 and Phe356-Val357. All 4 residues were mutated to either Gln (Q mutant) or Glu (E mutant). Computer analysis of predicted hydrophobicity indicated that these mutations would dramatically reduce the hydrophobicity of this region (Fig. 1B, lower panel). These mutant CaN A subunits were expressed individually in Sf9 cells and purified on CaM-Sepharose. Analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blot indicated highly purified subunits (Fig. 4). The low basal phosphatase activities of these expressed mutant CaN A subunits, assayed in the presence of Mn2+, were equivalent to the basal activity of the wild-type A subunit (Fig. 5, left bars). Wild-type and mutant A subunit phosphatase activities were each stimulated 5-6-fold by Mn2+/CaM (Fig. 5, middle bars). Thus, the mutant CaN A subunits had indistinguishable properties relative to wild-type A subunit in terms of basal phosphatase activity and activation by CaM. However, the mutant A subunits did not exhibit activation by B subunit upon in vitro reconstitution whereas the wild-type A subunit was stimulated 40-fold (Fig. 5, right bars). Fig. 5(inset) shows that wild-type A subunit was maximally activated by a 1:1 molar ratio of B subunit to A subunit, but the mutants were not affected by 3.4-fold molar excess of B subunit. Our reconstitution conditions included 1.5 mM Mn2+, and we previously determined that the presence of Ca2+ had no effect. Since the B subunit is a Ca2+-binding protein, we also tested for reconstitution of the mutant A subunits with the B subunit in the presence of 0.5 mM Ca2+, but there was still no detectable activation of the mutant A subunits by B subunit (data not shown). Because the reconstitution is relatively slow (Fig. 3A), there may be refolding of either or both subunits during the incubation. If the mutant A subunits were improperly folded, they may not be able to properly unfold to interact with B subunit. We added 6 M urea, which is known to cause dissociation of the A and B subunits(13.Merat D.L. Hu Z.Y. Carter T.E. Cheung W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11053-11059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to a mixture of B subunit plus either wild-type or mutant A subunits, incubated them overnight and then dialyzed out the urea prior to assaying phosphatase activity. The resulting phosphatase activities of wild-type and mutant A subunit plus B subunit incubations were essentially identical to the far right bars in Fig. 5(data not shown).Figure 5Effects of mutagenesis of CaN A subunit on phosphatase activities and reconstitution with B subunit. Purified wild-type CaN A and mutants Gln (Q) and Glu (E) at 50 nM were assayed at 30°C for 10 min without (left bars) or with (middle bars) CaM (500 nM) in the presence of 1.5 mM Mn2+ and 60 μM 32P-RII peptide. Each subunit (50 nM) was reconstituted for 2 h with 170 nM CaN B subunit (see “Experimental Procedures”) prior to determining phosphatase activities (right bars). The inset shows the effect of the molar ratio of B subunit to A subunit on the reconstitution. All assays were performed in duplicate, and each point represents the mean ± S.D. from two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above results suggest that the hydrophobic residues mutated in the CaN A subunit are essential to in vitro association of the A and B subunits. To further test the role of these hydrophobic residues, the wild-type and mutant CaN A subunits were co-expressed with the B subunit in Sf9 cells. The Western blot in Fig. 6A shows that both the A and B subunits were expressed in the cells. The doublet of immunoreactive bands at about 19 kDa was due to the presence of both the myristylated (lower band) and non-myristylated (upper band) B subunits.2 The Sf9 extracts were subjected to CaM-Sepharose, which purifies the CaN A subunits due to their CaM-binding domains (Fig. 6B). With co-expressed wild-type subunits, the B subunit co-purifies with the CaN A subunit due to their interaction, and the Western blot of the CaN eluted from the CaM-Sepharose detects both A and B subunits. Note that both the myristylated and non-myristylated B subunits are present in the holoenzyme (Fig. 6B). However, the B subunit did not co-purify with either of the mutant CaN A subunits, confirming their lack of interaction (Fig. 6B). Thus, the B subunit does not interact with the mutant A subunits either in the in vitro reconstitution assay or when co-expressed in Sf9 cells. This study used multiple approaches to identify the region of the CaN A subunit that is involved in binding of the regulatory B subunit. The B subunit binding domain was likely to be located between the catalytic domain and the CaM-binding domain, since limited proteolysis in the absence of Ca2+/CaM cleaves the A subunit NH2-terminal of the CaM-binding domain but the B subunit is still associated with the catalytic A subunit(21.Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We focused on the highly conserved (Fig. 1) sequence 328-390 between the catalytic domain and the CaM-binding domain. The fusion protein GST/A328-390 containing the putative B subunit-binding domain specifically bound CaN B (Fig. 2) and potently inhibited in vitro interaction of the A and B subunits (Fig. 3B). Interaction of the CaN A and B subunits requires 6 M urea for dissociation(13.Merat D.L. Hu Z.Y. Carter T.E. Cheung W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11053-11059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the potential importance of hydrophobic interactions. Since the synthetic peptide corresponding to CaN A sequence 341-360 blocked binding of CaN B to GST/A328-390 (data not shown), we focused on hydrophobic residues (Phe and Val) within 341-360 and mutated two hydrophobic clusters to either Gln or Glu. Glu and Gln were chosen because they are both very hydrophilic and they have side-chain bulkiness close to Phe and Val. The mutant A subunits were well expressed in Sf9 cells and purified on CaM-Sepharose (Fig. 4). However, the two mutant CaN A subunits did not interact with the B subunit as determined by both enzymatic assay after in vitro reconstitution (Fig. 5) and physical detection after co-expression and purification on CaM-Sepharose (Fig. 6). The inability of the Gln mutant to bind the B subunit was presumably due to the decreased hydrophobicity of residues 347-357, whereas the lack of B subunit binding of the Glu mutant could additionally involve the acidic charges. The CaN B subunit is an acidic protein(2.Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar). The inability of the mutant A subunits to bind B subunit was probably not due to major conformational changes induced by the mutations since 1) both mutant A subunits alone had Mn2+-stimulated phosphatase activities similar to wild-type A subunit (Fig. 5, far left bars), and 2) both mutant A subunits bound (i.e. were purified on CaM-Sepharose) and were stimulated by (Fig. 5, middle bars) Ca2+/CaM. Since the catalytic (residues 71-325) and CaM-binding (residues 391-414) domains are normal in the mutant A subunits and they flank the region of mutagenesis (residues 349-357), any putative structural changes would be confined to the B subunit-binding domain. Furthermore, in vitro reconstitution after exposure of both subunits to 6 M urea was normal for wild-type A subunit but did not occur with either mutant. Finally, the mutant A subunits, unlike wild-type A subunit, did not interact with B subunit when they were co-expressed in Sf9 cells (Fig. 6). Binding of the B subunit to the catalytic CaN A subunit is essential to its activity and regulation of its phosphatase activity. We have recently determined that Ca2+ binding to the B subunit activates CaN by both decreasing its Km and increasing the Vmax, whereas Ca2+ binding to CaM increases only Vmax.2 It will be important to determine the mechanism by which binding of the B subunit to the A subunit alters the phosphatase kinetic properties, and this identification of the domain in the A subunit which binds the B subunit will facilitate further study. Our results identifying hydrophobic residues 349/350 and 356/357 in the A subunit as essential for binding of the B subunit do not exclude the potential involvement of other residues (e.g. residues 365-371, LVNVLNI, Fig. 1B) in B subunit binding. We are also initiating a study to determine residues in the B subunit involved in binding to the A subunit."

These changes are regulated by a gel-sol transformation of the actin filament network, and actin filament-severing proteins are responsible for network solation. Macrophage Cap G, unlike all other proteins in the gelsolin family, caps but does not sever actin filaments. Two amino acid stretches in Cap G diverge markedly from the severing proteins: 84LNTLLGE and 124AFHKTS. Discrete mutations in Cap G have been generated to determine if these amino acid sequences are critical for actin filament severing. Conversion of 84LNTLLGE to the gelsolin actin-binding helix sequence ( 84LDDYLGG) renders Cap G capable of severing actin filaments (half-maximal severing, 1-2 μM). Adding a second set of mutations, converting 124AFHKTS to 124GFKHV, enhances severing by 10-fold (half-maximal severing, 0.1-0.2 μM). These experiments support a critical role for these two regions in actin filament severing and showcase the power of gain-of-function mutations in clarifying structure-function relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2064098131,"The common substrate for glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), is an inhibitor of Escherichia coli growth. This growth inhibition by CDNB is enhanced when E. coli expresses a functional GST. Cells under growth inhibition have reduced intracellular GSH levels and form filaments when they resume growth. Based on this differential growth inhibition by CDNB we have developed a simple procedure to select for null-mutants of a human GST in E. coli. Null mutations in the human GST gene from hydroxylamine mutagenesis or oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis can be selected for on agar plates containing CDNB after transformation. The molecular nature of each mutation can be identified by DNA sequence analysis of the mutant GST gene. We have identified three essential amino acid residues in an alpha class human GST at Glu31, Glu96, and Gly97. Single substitution at each of these residues, E31K, E96K, G97D, resulted in mutant GST proteins with loss of CDNB conjugation activity and failure in binding to the S-hexyl GSH affinity matrix. In contrast, a mutant GST (Y8F) resulting from substitution of the conserved tyrosine near the N terminus has much reduced CDNB conjugation activity but was still capable of binding to the S-hexyl GSH-agarose. Additional mutant GSTs with substitutions at position 96 (E96F, E96Y) and 97 (G97P, G97T, G97S) resulted in changes in both Km and kcat to different extents. The in vitro CDNB conjugation activity of the purified mutant enzymes correlate negatively with the plating efficiencies of strains encoding them in the presence of CDNB. Based on the x-ray structure model of human GST 1-1, two of these residues are involved in salt bridges (Arg19-Glu31, Arg68-Glu96) and the third Gly97 is in the middle of the helix alpha 4. Our results provide evidence in vivo that Tyr8, Gly97, and the two salt bridges are important for GST structure-function. This molecular genetic approach for the identification of essential amino acids in GSTs should be applicable to any GSTs with CDNB conjugation activity. It should also complement the x-ray crystallographic approach in understanding the structure and function of GSTs."

Suramin, as well as bacterially expressed and refolded human alpha PDGFR domains 1-3, inhibited beta PDGFR-HFc binding to PDGF BB half-maximally at 25 microM and 10 nM respectively. Therefore, alpha PDGFR D1-3, like beta PDGFR D1-3, are sufficient for high affinity PDGF BB binding.

These tetrahedral Zn-binding sites were designed to mimic both secondary and tertiary structural characteristics of catalytic metal sites in enzymes. Each site was planned to have two His ligands across from each other on adjacent antiparallel beta-strands. Sites were selected to sequester the metal ion from bulk solvent and place an open metal coordination position next to the antigen or potential substrates. Three distinct metal-site designs, with ligands in the variable light domain, in the variable heavy domain, and in both domains, were later implemented experimentally and shown spectroscopically to bind metal ions as predicted. These results demonstrate the success of our design approach, the versatility of the antibody structure for metalloprotein design, and the validity of the 3-dimensional model. The ability to predictably design multiple metal sites in the ordered antigen-recognition region at the bottom of the pocket allows tuning of metal ion placement and enhances the likelihood of interaction with putative substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1573027066,"The processes underlying molecular evolution have proved difficult to understand due to the complexity and obscurity of the selective pressures at work. The strong selective pressure to optimize antigen recognition means that antibody paratopes are more favorable systems than most in which to investigate these processes, as are viral epitopes, which evolve under an inverse pressure, rapidly changing to avoid recognition. Because recognition is a property of the surfaces of these molecules we expect that their evolutionary development may be read in the changes in the 3-dimensional array of chemical groups displayed on their surface. We have analyzed the bulk properties of these surfaces and find that there are significant differences in exposed amino acid preferences among 1) a control group of immunologically secluded proteins, 2) binding surfaces of immunoglobulins, and 3) the outer surfaces of picornaviruses. Compared to the control group, the immunoglobulin complementarity determining regions possess a relative excess of serine residues whereas picornaviruses suppress serine but overuse threonine residues, suggesting that the differing selective pressure has led to perturbations in the population of amino acid types on the surface of these proteins. Although these changes may be rationalized in terms of the structure and chemistry of the different side chains, we suggest that there may be a further, genetic component behind the observations: point mutations in the respective codons for serine and threonine lead to markedly different forms of structural variability. The high rate of reselection observed for these residues is in line with this second mechanism."

These difference spectra indicate that the conformational changes in the Fab upon peptide binding are confined to the combining site region of the antibody. The NOESY difference spectra of selectively deuterated Fab molecules were used in combination with HOHAHA measurements to assign the interactions to amino acid type and to identify the interactions within the Fab as either inter- or intraresidue interactions. The assignment of interactions within the Fab to corresponding aromatic residues in the Fab sequence was facilitated by an earlier NMR-derived model calculated on the basis of NOE restraints on Fab-peptide and intra-bound-peptide distances. The new restraints on distances within the Fab, combined with the previously obtained restraints, were used to generate a refined NMR-derived model for the TE33-peptide complex."

In the present work, this mutant receptor (M121) was shown to have an abnormal sensitivity to temperature and an alteration in “negative cooperativity.” In contrast to the wild-type receptor (HIRC), insulin binding by the M121 receptor was rapidly and irreversibly lost at temperatures above 30°C with the phosphorylated form of the receptor being more temperature-sensitive than the nonphosphorylated form. Although insulin binding activity was lost, Western analysis and other studies showed that the mutant receptor remained intact. Measurements of 125I-insulin dissociation at 21°C in the presence of native insulin (an estimate of negative cooperativity) demonstrated a difference between the mutant and wild-type receptor. Insulin dissociation from the mutant receptor was not as pronounced as that found with the wild-type receptor. Thus, an abnormality in insulin binding by the mutation was evident at lower “permissive” temperatures. The results of these and other studies argue that Lys-121 occupies an important position for the regulation of insulin receptor conformation. This regulation apparently influences negative cooperative interactions with insulin and modulates signal transduction.

INTRODUCTIONA large amount of work has been conducted on mapping the insulin binding site(s) in the insulin receptor in attempts to understand how the ligand binding process stimulates the receptor's tyrosine kinase activity and regulates other phenomena such as negative cooperativity and receptor internalization.

However, a number of unresolved issues remain. The relative contributions to insulin binding by the amino terminus of the α-subunit, the high cysteine region, and the regions toward the carboxyl terminus of this subunit need to be clarified(15.Yip C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 48: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Affinity labeling experiments have also provided some conflicting evidence, with one group identifying a region in the high cysteine domain and another group identifying the amino terminus as important for insulin binding(15.Yip C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 48: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Finally, more information is needed on regions that support changes in conformation which regulate β-subunit tyrosine kinase activity and/or insulin binding affinity (i.e. negative cooperativity).Recently we described the presence of a deletion of Lys-121 in one allele of the insulin receptor gene of a severely insulin-resistant child with leprechaunism(16.Jospe, N., Zhu, J., Liu, R., Livingston, J., Furlanetto, R. (1994) J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab., in pressGoogle Scholar).

In attempts to evaluate further the impact of the mutation on other actions of the receptor, we undertook studies of insulin processing and internalization. This work uncovered the finding that the mutation caused an abnormal sensitivity of the purified receptor to physiologic temperatures and to an alteration in the insulin-mediated dissociation of radiolabeled insulin, i.e. a change in negative cooperativity. These and other findings argue that Lys-121 plays an important role in mediating conformational changes that accompany the activation of the tyrosine kinase activity and the insulin-stimulated reduction in ligand binding affinity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe CHO cell lines CHO-HIRC and CHO-M121 have been described in detail previously(16.Jospe, N., Zhu, J., Liu, R., Livingston, J., Furlanetto, R. (1994) J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab., in pressGoogle Scholar). In brief, both lines were derived from stable transfections with cytomegalovirus-driven expression plasmids that expressed wild-type (HIRC) insulin receptor or the Lys-121 deletion mutation (M121) prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. Following selection by G418, cells were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using an antibody against the α-subunit of the human insulin receptor(2.Bastian W. Zhu J. Way B. Lockwood D. Livingston J. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 966-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). An enriched population of cells was obtained which expressed similar amounts of wild-type insulin receptor or mutant receptor as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. 125I-Insulin (2,000 Ci/mmol), [32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), and L[35S]methionine (1,000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Corp. Polyclonal antibody against the carboxyl-terminal portion of the insulin receptor (a-CT) was a gift from Dr. Jaime Flores-Riveros, Miles Inc. Monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine (a-PY) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against the α-subunit (residues 657-670) of the human insulin receptor were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY. Pansorbin was obtained from Calbiochem. Protein G-Sepharose was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulin were from Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA. 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium phosphatase substrate was bought from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) gel was obtained from EY Labs Inc., San Mateo, CA.Flow Cytometry StudiesThe concentration of wild-type and mutant insulin receptors on the surface of CHO cells was determined by flow cytometry studies exactly as reported previously(2.Bastian W. Zhu J. Way B. Lockwood D. Livingston J. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 966-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present studies, a monoclonal antibody, A-IR1 was used as described.Measurement of 125I-Insulin Binding, Internalization, and Degradation by CHO CellsStandard insulin binding studies were conducted at 4 and at 24°C in 24-well plates as described previously(2.Bastian W. Zhu J. Way B. Lockwood D. Livingston J. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 966-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17.Shapiro D. Livingston J. Maniscalco W. Finkelstein J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 885: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In studies conducted at 37°C, 125I-insulin was added, and the incubation continued for the indicated times. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with ice-cold Krebs buffer, pH 7.4. The cells were dissolved in 1 N NaOH and the radioactivity determined to assess the total amount of radiolabeled insulin associated with the cells. In parallel studies, the cells were washed with ice-cold “acid” Krebs, i.e. pH 3.5, to remove cell surface-bound insulin. Solubilization and determination of the radioactivity allowed the amount of insulin in internal compartments of the cell to be determined (18.de Vries C. Van Haeften T. Rao B. Van Der Veen E. Diabete & Metabol. 1990; 16: 70-76PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Haigler H. Maxfield F. Willingham M. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1239-1241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate insulin degradation, the media from the cells were subjected to 10% trichloroacetic acid precipitation(18.de Vries C. Van Haeften T. Rao B. Van Der Veen E. Diabete & Metabol. 1990; 16: 70-76PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific associations of radiolabeled insulin were determined by the inclusion of excess native insulin (5,000 ng/ml) in parallel incubations.Measurement of the Temperature Sensitivity for Insulin ReceptorsMutant and wild-type insulin receptors were partially purified from CHO cells by WGA affinity chromatography(20.Harrison L. Itin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 12066-12072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The WGA-purified receptors were incubated for the indicated time and temperature and then chilled to 4°C. A soluble insulin binding assay was conducted at 4°C as described, and the receptor-insulin complexes were precipitated by polyethylene glycol(21.Arner P. Pollare T. Lithell H. Livingston J. Diabetologia. 1987; 30: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In some studies, the receptors were purified further using a-CT, which was raised against the amino acid sequence CNGRVLTLPRSNPS present in the carboxyl terminus of the mouse β-subunit. This antibody immunoprecipitates mouse, rat, and human insulin receptors and does not precipitate the IGF-I receptor (data not shown). The antibody was absorbed to Pansorbin and then incubated with WGA extracts. Following extensive washes with 50 mM Tris, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4, and once with this buffer plus 0.5 M LiCl, the preparation was used to conduct the various studies described.To prepare autophosphorylated insulin receptor, 100 μg of WGA extract was autophosphorylated under conditions described previously(2.Bastian W. Zhu J. Way B. Lockwood D. Livingston J. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 966-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16.Jospe, N., Zhu, J., Liu, R., Livingston, J., Furlanetto, R. (1994) J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab., in pressGoogle Scholar) and then incubated with a-PY absorbed to protein G-agarose. After 3 h at 4°C, the beads were collected and washed extensively with a 1% Triton buffer (50 mM Tris, 1% Triton X-100, pH 6.5) at 21°C to remove bound insulin. The agarose beads were then washed three times with 50 mM Tris, 0.1% Triton X-100, and the receptor eluted from a-PY with 50 mMp-nitrophenyl phosphate. The eluted receptor was used in the various studies of temperature inactivation.Western Blot Analysis of Insulin ReceptorsWGA extracts containing the mutant and wild-type receptors (5 μg of protein/sample) were placed in 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 6.8, and 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol, heated at 100°C for 5 min, and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% acrylamide resolving gel). The protein was transferred to Immobilon-P membrane, and the membrane was blocked with 5% milk in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.1 M NaCl solution. The membrane was probed with antibody against the α-subunit of the insulin receptor (1 μg/ml) and the blot developed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin using standard methods.Insulin Dissociation ExperimentsFifty μg of WGA protein was incubated overnight at 4°C with 0.5 μCi of 125I-insulin and a-CT absorbed to Pansorbin. The Pansorbin samples were washed twice in ice-cold 50 mM Tris, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 200 μl of this buffer. Dissociation of 125I-insulin was initiated by adding 50 μl of the suspension to 9.95 ml of buffer maintained at 22°C. Native insulin was present in or absent from the dilution buffer as indicated. At different times after the dilution, 0.5-ml aliquots were subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C, and the radioactivity in the pellet was determined by γ-counting. The amount of 125I-insulin bound to the receptor at zero time was determined by diluting the 50-μl aliquot into 9.95 ml of buffer maintained at 4°C, and 0.5-ml samples were subjected immediately to centrifugation and the radioactivity in the pellets determined.RESULTSAbnormal Processing of Insulin by CHO Cells That Express the Mutant Insulin ReceptorInitial studies of the M121 receptor examined its ability to internalize and process insulin during insulin treatment of CHO cells at 37°C. Fig. 1 shows that CHO-HIRC and CHO-M121 cell lines have equal numbers of cell surface insulin receptors as measured by flow cytometry using an antibody specific for the α-subunit of the human insulin receptor. The results also indicate that each cell line is generally homogeneous for the concentration of insulin receptors, i.e. no significant subpopulation of cells exists which express significantly more or less receptors than the general cell population. Insulin binding studies have been conducted previously with both cell lines at 21°C, and the results showed similar amounts of insulin binding activity(16.Jospe, N., Zhu, J., Liu, R., Livingston, J., Furlanetto, R. (1994) J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab., in pressGoogle Scholar).Fig. 2 illustrates the ability of the two cell lines to specifically bind, internalize, and degrade insulin at 37°C. In these studies, 125I-insulin was added to confluent CHO-HIRC and CHO-M121 cells. At the indicated times, the amounts of 125I-insulin associated with the cell surface, the amounts internalized by the cells, and the amount of degraded insulin in the medium were determined. Fig. 2A shows that the amount of 125I-insulin bound to CHO-M121 was approximately 50% that bound to CHO-HIRC. The alteration in M121 cell-associated insulin also correlated with the reduction in the amount of 125I-insulin internalized, which was 20-30% the amount found in CHO-HIRC (Fig. 2A). This reduction in insulin internalization was parallel to a reduction in the amount of degraded insulin in the medium (Fig. 2B).Figure 2Time course for insulin binding, insulin internalization, and insulin degradation by CHO cells. Panel A, confluent CHO-HIRC and CHO-M121 were incubated at 37°C with 125I-insulin. At the indicated times, the total amount of hormone associated with the cells (squares) or the acid-resistant (intracellular) amount (triangles) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel B, degradation of 125I-insulin by CHO cells was measured at the indicated times. The data are representative of four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The marked discrepancy between the ability of CHO-M121 and CHO-HIRC cells to process insulin might result from a number of causes, including the kinase signaling defect noted previously for this mutation(16.Jospe, N., Zhu, J., Liu, R., Livingston, J., Furlanetto, R. (1994) J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab., in pressGoogle Scholar). Alternatively, it could be related to an abnormal temperature sensitivity of binding, which had escaped detection in earlier work since our previous insulin binding measurements were made at temperatures of 22°C or lower.M121 Insulin Receptor Loses Its Ability to Bind Insulin at Elevated TemperaturesThe insulin binding activity of WGA-purified receptors was determined after incubation for the indicated times at 37°C (Fig. 3A). As shown, the incubation of wild-type receptor for periods up to 350 min did not alter its ability to bind insulin when the receptor was subsequently cooled to 4°C and binding activity measured. In contrast, the mutant receptor's binding activity rapidly decreased (t1/2 of approximately 45 min) during the 37°C incubation.Figure 3Effect of incubation at 37°C on the insulin binding activity of the partially purified M121 and wild-type (HIRC) insulin receptors. Panel A, WGA-purified receptors were incubated for the indicated period of time at 37°C and then chilled to 4°C. Insulin binding activity was measured at 4°C (see “Experimental Procedures”). The B/F value for insulin binding at the 0 time point (100% binding) for both receptor types was approximately 0.35. The results are the mean of three separate experiments. Panel B, insulin receptors in the WGA extract were further purified by a-CT and immobilized on Pansorbin. Following this step they were incubated at 37°C for the indicated periods of time. The samples were then cooled to 4°C, and insulin binding studies were performed on the immobilized receptors. The B/F value for the 0 time point for the HIRC receptor was 0.42 and for M121 receptor was 0.45. Panel C, WGA extracts containing the receptors were subjected to insulin-mediated autophosphorylation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The phosphorylated receptors were immunoprecipitated by a-PY and protein G-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were washed in a 1% Triton X-100, slightly acid (pH 6.5) buffer to remove insulin, and the receptors were eluted from the antibody with p-nitrophenyl phosphate. These eluates underwent incubation at 37°C for the times indicated after which they were tested for insulin binding activity at 4°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar studies were also conducted on receptors purified by precipitation with a-CT, an antibody specific for the carboxyl terminus of the β-subunit. This immobilized preparation showed normal insulin binding characteristics at 4 and 21°C for wild-type and M121 receptors (data not shown). In contrast, as illustrated in Fig. 3B, the mutant receptor again demonstrated a marked reduction in insulin binding activity after incubation at 37°C. Such results with an immunopurified receptor preparation argue that non-receptor contaminants in the WGA extract do not contribute to the loss of insulin binding activity by the mutant receptor.Fig. 3C provides additional data that support a change in the temperature sensitivity of the mutant receptor. In this study wild-type and mutant receptors underwent insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation. The autophosphorylated receptors were purified with an a-PY, a step that also allowed insulin to be removed in anticipation of conducting insulin binding measurements. As shown, the phosphorylated mutant receptor is much more sensitive to 37°C treatment than the nonphosphorylated form, i.e. almost complete destruction of insulin binding activity by 10 min as compared with a 50% reduction of binding by the nonphosphorylated mutant receptor by 40-50 min. As in the other studies, the wild-type receptor was stable to incubation at 37°C, even when in the phosphorylated form.Experiments were conducted to evaluate whether or not the mutant receptor remained intact during the 37°C incubation. Fig. 4A shows a Western blot of the wild-type and mutant receptor α-subunit before and after incubation at 37°C. The amount of α-subunit did not change during the incubation of either receptor type. The experiment described in Fig. 4B investigated whether or not the α2β2 holoreceptor structure remains intact during the 37°C incubation. In these studies the receptors were incubated with [32P]ATP at 21°C in the presence and absence of insulin. The receptor preparations were then incubated at 37°C for 1 h, conditions that destroy 50% of the insulin binding activity of the mutant receptor. As the nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows, the size of the mutant holoreceptor was similar to the wild-type receptor. No evidence was found of smaller receptor fragments that would indicate disruption of its tetrameric structure.Figure 4Structural examination of M121 and HIRC receptors after incubation at 37°C. Panel A, Western blot of the α-subunit was performed on the WGA extracts after the indicated period of incubation of WGA extracts at 37°C. The arrow indicates the position of the α-subunit. Panel B, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the nonreduced receptors following autophosphorylation at 22°C in the presence or absence of insulin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The receptors were either placed at 4°C or subjected to a 1-h incubation at 37°C. The receptors were collected by polyethylene glycol precipitation and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 5% resolving gel as described above but in the absence of reductant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results clearly show that insulin binding by the isolated mutant receptor is abnormally sensitive to incubation at 37°C. Moreover, the failure to retain insulin binding activity is not due to gross structural changes in its α2β2 architecture. A more detailed examination of the temperature sensitivity of mutant and wild-type receptors is shown in Fig. 5. In this study the receptors were immunopurified with a-CT and immobilized on Pansorbin. They were then subjected to the indicated temperature for 1 h and cooled to 4°C for measurement of insulin binding activity. As shown, there is a sharp drop in insulin binding activity by the M121 receptor as the temperature is raised above 30°C. In contrast, the insulin binding activity of the wild-type receptor is stable up to temperatures of 40°C.Figure 5The effect of temperature on insulin binding activity by M121 and HIRC receptors. The receptors were immobilized with the a-CT antibody on Pansorbin. They were incubated for 1 h at the indicated temperatures and then chilled to 4°C. Insulin binding activity was measured at 4°C. The results are the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6 illustrates Scatchard plots of insulin binding data for the two receptor types before and after incubation at 37°C. In agreement with previous findings(16.Jospe, N., Zhu, J., Liu, R., Livingston, J., Furlanetto, R. (1994) J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab., in pressGoogle Scholar), the Scatchard plot obtained at 21°C for the mutant receptor is very similar to that for the wild-type receptor (panel A). As expected, 37°C treatment for 45 min caused a marked decrease in the amount of high affinity insulin binding activity by the mutant receptor preparation (panel B). This indicates that the loss in binding activity of the M121 receptor is due to an irreversible inactivation of the binding site rather than a decrease in binding affinity.Figure 6Scatchard plots of insulin binding by M121 and HIRC receptors before and after incubation at 37°C. Panel A, insulin binding studies using WGA-purified receptors were conducted at 22°C in the absence of a 37°C treatment period. Panel B, the receptors were incubated for 45 min at 37°C before conducting the insulin binding studies at 22°C. The results are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Studies of Insulin DissociationAlthough Scatchard plots of the mutant and wild-type receptors were similar in the unheated preparations, which suggest normal insulin binding kinetics for the mutation, a more extensive analysis of the insulin binding kinetics was undertaken which included the measurements of insulin dissociation rates. The receptors immobilized on Pansorbin were first allowed to bind 125I-insulin at 4°C, and dissociation of the hormone was induced by dilution with buffer maintained at 22°C. Control studies show that the conditions used to bind 125I-insulin to the receptors resulted in the labeling of about 5% of the total insulin binding sites (data not shown). In addition the steps involved in the washing of the immobilized receptors and their dilution for dissociation measurements ensured that essentially no rebinding of the tracer insulin occurs once it has dissociated from the binding site.As shown in Fig. 7A, the rate of dissociation in the absence of any native insulin in the dilution buffer was slow for both wild-type and mutant receptors. The addition of 100 nM insulin to the dilution buffer caused an acceleration in the rate of insulin dissociation from both receptor types. However, this insulin-mediated effect was much less with the mutant than with the wild-type receptor, i.e. at 2.5-min dissociation in the presence of 100 nM insulin, the mutant receptor retained approximately 60% of the insulin bound at zero time compared with the 33% retained by the wild-type receptor. These findings clearly demonstrate a difference in the insulin binding properties of the mutant receptor, even in the absence of heat treatment. The same qualitative differences between mutant and wild-type receptors were found when the receptor preparations underwent a 37°C incubation for 45 min before the dissociation experiments (Fig. 7B).Figure 7Studies of negative cooperativity with M121 and HIRC receptors. Panel A, receptors from WGA extracts were immobilized with a-CT on Pansorbin. The immobilized receptor preparations were maintained at 4°C and labeled with 125I-insulin. Studies of the rate of dissociation at 22°C were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The triangles (also shown as +) indicate dissociation in the presence of 100 nM insulin. The squares represent dissociation in the absence of native insulin. Similar amounts of specifically bound 125I-insulin were used to initiate these experiments (at 0 time, HIRC = 47,500 cpm and M121 receptor = 38,700 cpm). Panel B, the receptor preparations were first treated at 37°C for 45 min before being chilled to 4°C and labeled with 125I-insulin. Cooperativity experiments were then conducted as described in panel A. The amount of labeled insulin bound to the receptor preparations at 0 time differed for HIRC receptors (41,400 cpm) and M121 receptors (20,300 cpm) even though the same amount of material was used as for the experiments shown in panel A. This difference is expected because of the loss of binding activity by the M121 receptor when incubated at 37°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"
https://openalex.org/W2064942634,"Site-directed mutagenesis of an amino acid residue in the substrate binding site of porcine fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was carried out based on the crystal structure of the enzyme (Zhang, Y., Liang, J.-Y., Huang, S., Ke, H., and Lipscomb, W. N.(1993) Biochemistry 32, 1844-1857). A mutant enzyme form of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, G122A, was purified and characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism spectrometry (CD), and initial rate kinetics. There were no discernible differences between the secondary structures of the wild-type and the mutant enzyme on the basis of CD data. Altering Gly-122 to alanine caused a significant decrease in the enzyme's activity and affinity for Mg2+. The k cat for this mutant enzyme was only about 5% of that of wild-type fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and the Ka for Mg2+ was about 20-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. The Ki for AMP was increased 77-fold in the case of the mutant enzyme; however, the Hill coefficient was unaltered. Most importantly, it was observed that replacement of Gly-122 with alanine caused the total loss of cooperativity for Mg2+. It is concluded that Gly-122 is essential for Mg2+ cooperativity and important for binding of Mg2+ and AMP as well as for enzyme activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of an amino acid residue in the substrate binding site of porcine fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was carried out based on the crystal structure of the enzyme (Zhang, Y., Liang, J.-Y., Huang, S., Ke, H., and Lipscomb, W. N.(1993) Biochemistry 32, 1844-1857). A mutant enzyme form of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, G122A, was purified and characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism spectrometry (CD), and initial rate kinetics. There were no discernible differences between the secondary structures of the wild-type and the mutant enzyme on the basis of CD data. Altering Gly-122 to alanine caused a significant decrease in the enzyme's activity and affinity for Mg2+. The k cat for this mutant enzyme was only about 5% of that of wild-type fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and the Ka for Mg2+ was about 20-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. The Ki for AMP was increased 77-fold in the case of the mutant enzyme; however, the Hill coefficient was unaltered. Most importantly, it was observed that replacement of Gly-122 with alanine caused the total loss of cooperativity for Mg2+. It is concluded that Gly-122 is essential for Mg2+ cooperativity and important for binding of Mg2+ and AMP as well as for enzyme activity. It is well known that fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) 1The abbreviations used are: FBPasefructose-1,6-bisphosphataseFru-1,6-P2fructose 1,6-bisphosphateFru-6-Pfructose 6-phosphateFru-2,6-P2fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.is a crucial step in the regulation of gluconeogenesis(1.Underwood A.H. Newsholme E.A. Biochem. J. 1965; 95: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 2.McGilvay R.W. McGilvay R.W. Pogell B.M. Fructose-1,6-diphosphatase and Its Role in Gluconeogenesis. Port City Press Inc., Baltimore1964: 3-10Google Scholar, 3.Krebs H.A. Weber G. Advances in Enzyme Regulation. 1. Pergamon Press Ltd., London1963: 385-400Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) to fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) and inorganic phosphate and exhibits a rapid equilibrium random Bi Bi kinetic mechanism(4.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction is competitively inhibited by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) and noncompetitively inhibited by AMP(4.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two compounds are also involved in the activation of phosphofructokinase(5.Hers H.-G. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is thought that Fru-2,6-P2 plays crucial roles in the regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. AMP is also an important element in the regulation of FBPase because it acts synergistically with Fru-2,6-P2 to inhibit FBPase(5.Hers H.-G. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The role of AMP is thought to prevent divalent metal binding to FBPase, and divalent cations such as Mg2+ and Mn2+ are absolutely required for FBPase activity(4.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Scheffler J.E. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6659-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One of the functions of Fru-2,6-P2 is to keep AMP on the enzyme (make it stickier) (7.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9122-9128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus enhancing the action of AMP. fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase fructose 1,6-bisphosphate fructose 6-phosphate fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. FBPase has long been recognized to be a metal-requiring enzyme(8.Gomori G. J. Biol. Chem. 1943; 148: 139-149Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Univalent cations can activate the enzyme(9.Hubert E. Villanueva J. Gonzalez A.M. Marcus F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 138: 590-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but divalent cations are absolutely required for enzyme activity(8.Gomori G. J. Biol. Chem. 1943; 148: 139-149Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The crystallographic structure, reported by the Lipscomb group(10.Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1844-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggests that two divalent cations are bound at the metal-binding site. Benkovic et al.(11.Benkovic S.J. deMaine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Benkovic P.A. Caperelli C.A. deMaine M.M. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2185-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) suggested that catalysis requires the sequential addition of metal and substrate in the order, structural metal, substrate, and catalytic metal to form a catalytically competent quaternary complex of enzyme-M1-M2-Fru-1,6-P2. Nimmo and Tipton (13.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that pH could affect the divalent metal kinetics of bovine liver FBPase, i.e. the plots of velocity versus Mg2+ are sigmoidal at neutral pH, but they are hyperbolic at pH 9.6. Furthermore, cooperativity with respect to metal ion binding and its activation of the mammalian FBPase reaction has long been recognized(11.Benkovic S.J. deMaine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J.

Remesh H. Chen M. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and El-Maghrabi et al.(17.El-Maghrabi M.R. Gidh-Jain M. Austin L.R. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9466-9472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) carried out site-directed mutagenesis experiments in the metal binding sites of mammalian FBPase. Their investigations support the suggestion that there are two metal binding sites associated with FBPase. FBPase from mammalian liver and kidney, two highly gluconeogenic tissues, is a homotetramer(18.Marcus F. Edelstein I. Reardon I. Heinrikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7161-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Alteration of the amino acid residues in the metal binding site can affect not only the cooperativity and ligand affinity of metal ions but also the enzyme's affinity for AMP (16.Chen L. Remesh H. Chen M. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that metal binding sites and AMP binding sites may somehow communicate with each other. X-ray diffraction results of FBPase have pinpointed a number of amino acid residues that are associated with substrate binding(10.Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1844-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These findings (10.Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1844-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) suggest that the main chain NH group of the Gly-122 residue forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond to the ester oxygen and a 1-phosphoryl oxygen of the substrate. Thus, this residue is postulated to have the function of fixing the 1-phosphoryl group in the required position for metal binding and catalysis. To gain some insight into the residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis, we have prepared a mutant of FBPase at position 122 by site-directed mutagenesis and have studied its properties. In this study, we report that replacement of Gly-122 with alanine causes the total loss of cooperativity of Mg2+ and very significant decreases in enzyme activity, AMP binding, and affinity for metal ions. NADP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2), fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), AMP, Hepes, and Tris were purchased from Sigma. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucoisomerase were from Boehringer Mannheim. Distilled deionized water was used in all experiments. All other reagents were of the highest purity available commercially. Recombinant and mutant forms of porcine liver FBPase were prepared and purified as described elsewhere (19.Burton V.A. Chen M. Ong W.C. Ling T. Fromm H.J. Stayton M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Mutant forms of the enzyme were obtained in yields comparable to the wild-type enzyme. Porcine liver and kidney FBPase are identical in their primary sequences(19.Burton V.A. Chen M. Ong W.C. Ling T. Fromm H.J. Stayton M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). There was no measurable endogenous expression of wild-type FBPase in the absence of added isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. A mutant of recombinant porcine liver FBPase, G122A, was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. A mutagenic oligonucleotide primer, 5′-CCC-CTC-GAT-GCA-TCG-TCG-AAC-3′, was synthesized by the β-cyanoethylphosphoramidite method at the Nucleic Acid Facility at Iowa State University. The codon GCA was used to mutate G122A. BamHI/SphI fragments encoding FBPase from pEt-11a were ligated into a previously digested PUC118 plasmid. The mutagenesis was done by using single-stranded DNA from recombinant pUC118 plasmid as the template and synthesized oligonucleotide as primer. The oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis procedure was performed as described by Nakamaye and Eckstein(20.Nakamaye K. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9679-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was verified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing(21.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52414) Google Scholar). The BamHI/XbaI fragments encoding the mutations were ligated back into previously digested pEt-11a expression vector. pEt-11a was used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Total protein was measured by the Bio-Rad method with bovine serum albumin (from Sigma) as a standard. CD studies on the wild-type and mutant form of FBPase were carried out in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH7.5) at room temperature in an AVIV CD spectrometer model 62DS kindly supplied by Dr. Earl Stellwagen at the University of Iowa. Samples were placed in a 1-mm cuvette, and data points were collected from 200 to 260 nm in 0.5-nm increments. Each spectrum was calibrated to remove the background of the buffer and smoothed by using a program in the computer of the spectrometer. FBPase activity during purification and the specific activity of pure enzyme were measured by using the phosphoglucoisomerase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase coupled spectrophotometric assay(22.Pontremodi S. Traniello S. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All other kinetic experiments were done using a fluorometric assay (4.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at pH 7.5 (50 mM Hepes buffer) and 24°C. The initial rate data were analyzed for kinetic mechanisms by using a Minitab language program with an α value of 2.0 (4.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cooperativity was evaluated by using both the ENZFITTER program (23.Leatherbarrow R.J. Enzfitter: A Non-Linear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBMPC. Elsevier Science Publishers BV, Cambridge, United Kingdom1987: 13-75Google Scholar) and the Minitab program. The purity of wild-type recombinant FBPase and the G122A mutant of porcine FBPase was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. The results are shown in Fig. 1. It was found that the proteins are greater than 95% pure using the criterion of electrophoresis. In addition, the single band exhibiting a molecular mass of approximately 37 kDa in each lane indicates that the proteins had not undergone discernible degradation. The secondary structures of recombinant wild-type and the G122A mutant of FBPase were analyzed by CD spectrometry. The purpose of this study was to determine whether localized or global structural alterations were induced in the mutant. The CD spectral data showed that the spectrum of the mutant was essentially superimposable on that of the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). These results suggest that no major conformational changes occurred in FBPase when Gly-122 was mutated to alanine by using CD as a criterion of secondary protein structure. Table 1 shows the kinetic parameters for wild-type and the G122A mutant of FBPase. The data were obtained by measuring the initial rate at saturating Mg2+ or Fru-1,6-P2 concentrations. From Table 1, it can be seen that replacement of Gly-122 with alanine caused a significant decrease in enzyme activity. The k cat of the G122A mutant of FBPase was only about 5% of that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the Km for Fru-1,6-P2 of this mutant form of the enzyme did not exhibit a large alteration, i.e. only a 3-fold increase compared with that of the wild-type enzyme.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The Hill coefficient and Ka for Mg2+ of the wild-type and mutant form of FBPase were determined at their saturating substrate concentrations; i.e. wild-type enzyme at 12 μM and G122A at 60 μM. As expected, the Hill coefficient of wild-type FBPase for Mg2+ was about 2.0, and Mg2+ activation of FBPase was sigmoidal (data not shown). These results indicate that Mg2+ activation of FBPase exhibits cooperativity. This is consistent with previous reports (13.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15.Tejwani G. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 121-193PubMed Google Scholar). It was observed, however, that altering Gly-122 to alanine caused the Hill coefficient for Mg2+ to decrease to about 1, i.e. the Mg2+ activation of FBPase was hyperbolic rather than sigmoidal (data not shown). These results indicate that replacement of Gly-122 with alanine results in a total loss of Mg2+ cooperativity. Furthermore, this mutant form of FBPase exhibited a significant decrease in its affinity for Mg2+, i.e. the apparent Ka for Mg2+ of this mutant form of the enzyme is about 20-fold greater than that of the wild-type enzyme. It is well known that Fru-2,6-P2, like the substrate Fru-1,6-P2, binds at the active site of FBPase(24.Ke H. Thorpe C.M. Seaton B.A. Marcus F. Lipcomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25.Ke H. Thorpe C.M. Seaton B.A. Lipscomb W.N. Marcus F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26.Scheffer J.E. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6659-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Since one is a substrate and the other a competitive inhibitor, FBPase must have the ability to distinguish between these two molecules. The Ki for Fru-2,6-P2 and the Km for Fru-1,6-P2 of the G122A mutant did increase slightly (about 3-fold) relative to wild-type FBPase. These results indicate that the Gly-122 residue is not important in permitting FBPase to discriminate between the substrate and inhibitor. In other words, it is not directly involved in Fru-2,6-P2 inhibition of FBPase. The effects of Fru-2,6-P2 inhibition on Mg2+ with the G122A mutant form of FBPase were also studied. The Ki increased with the increase of Mg2+ concentration as described previously(24.Ke H. Thorpe C.M. Seaton B.A. Marcus F. Lipcomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). At 5 mM Mg2+, the Ki for Fru-2,6-P2 is about 22 μM. AMP is known to be an allosteric inhibitor of FBPase(4.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Liang, J.-Y., Zhang, Y., Huang, S., Ke, H., Lipscomb, W. N. (1992) Regulation of Protein by Ligands: Proceedings of the Robert A. Welch Foundation Conference on Chemical Research, October 26-27, 1992, Houston, TexasGoogle Scholar), and the role of AMP is to remove divalent metal ions from FBPase(7.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9122-9128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the Gly-122 residue was converted to alanine, the Ki for AMP of this mutant increased about 77-fold relative to that of the wild-type enzyme (Table 1). This is a reasonable finding in light of the fact that, with this mutant, the Ka for Mg2+ also increased about 20-fold compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. It is believed that the AMP and metal binding sites can somehow communicate with each other, presumably though conformational changes(4.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9122-9128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Scheffer J.E. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6659-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The binding of AMP to wild-type FBPase is known to exhibit cooperativity(27.Liang, J.-Y., Zhang, Y., Huang, S., Ke, H., Lipscomb, W. N. (1992) Regulation of Protein by Ligands: Proceedings of the Robert A. Welch Foundation Conference on Chemical Research, October 26-27, 1992, Houston, TexasGoogle Scholar). The kinetic data for AMP inhibition with the two mutant forms of FBPase gave excellent fits to a cooperative model (28.Chen M. Chen L. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5554-5558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which the Hill coefficient is 2.0 (data not shown). Thus, the Gly-122 residue is not directly involved in the cooperativity of AMP binding to FBPase. To confirm the finding that altering Gly-122 to alanine results in the total loss of cooperativity for Mg2+ with FBPase, we studied the kinetics of the FBPase reaction in the absence of inhibitors. Fig. 2 shows the double-reciprocal plot of initial velocity against the concentration of Mg2+ at different fixed levels of Fru-1,6-P2. When Fru-1,6-P2 concentration was varied at different fixed concentrations of Mg2+, a family of lines intersecting to the left of the 1/velocity axis was obtained for double-reciprocal plots (data not shown). The data in Fig. 2 gave excellent fits to where n = 1 but fit poorly when n = 2. The form of is:1V=1Vm[1+KaAn+KbB+KiaAnKbB](Eq. 1) where V, Vm, A, B, Ka, Kb, and Kia represent the initial velocity, maximum velocity, the concentration of free Mg2+, the concentration of free Fru-1,6-P2, the Michaelis constant for Mg2+, the Michaelis constant for Fru-1,6-P2, and the dissociation constant for Mg2+, respectively; n represents the Hill coefficient for Mg2+ with FBPase. When n = 1, there is no cooperativity; when n = 2, the binding of Mg2+ to FBPase is cooperative, with a Hill coefficient of 2. is the fundamental initial rate equation for the sequential kinetic mechanism shown in. 2was alluded to on the basis of stochastic considerations. The curves shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 converge at a common point to the left of the 1/velocity axis, respectively. At pH 7.5 Cd2+ is a competitive inhibitor of Mg2+ and a noncompetitive inhibitor of Fru-1,6-P2, and Fru-2,6-P2 is a competitive inhibitor of Fru-1,6-P2 and a noncompetitive inhibitor of Mg2+. Similar results were obtained at pH 9.6(4.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).E+2A=EA2, Kia = (E)(A)2/EA2(Eq. 2) E+B=EB, Kib = (E)(B)/EB(Eq. 3) EA2+B=EA2B, Kb = (EA2)(B)/EA2B(Eq. 4) EB+2A=EA2B, Ka=(EB)(A)2/EA2B(Eq. 5) On the other hand, the kinetic data in the absence of inhibitors with wild-type FBPase (shown in Fig. 3) gave excellent fits to when n = 2 and did not fit well to when n = 1. Note that the only difference in the rate equations between the G122A mutant enzyme and the wild-type enzyme is the term n. The data shown in Fig. 3 are consistent with previous reports that show that binding of divalent metal ions to FBPase exhibits cooperativity(11.Benkovic S.J. deMaine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15.Tejwani G. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 121-193PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the findings illustrated in Fig. 2 exclude the possibility of cooperativity for Mg2+ with the G122A mutant enzyme. Had Mg2+ ions bound cooperatively to FBPase, the data would have fit to much better when n = 2 than when n = 1. On the basis of these results and the Hill coefficient obtained for G122A, it is reasonable to conclude that the Gly-122 residue is required for the cooperativity observed for Mg2+ with FBPase. The central finding of this report involves the complete loss of cooperativity for Mg2+ when FBPase Gly-122 is mutated to alanine. It is known that mammalian FBPase is a divalent metal-requiring enzyme (8.Gomori G. J. Biol. Chem. 1943; 148: 139-149Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and that the Hill coefficient is 2.0 at neutral pH (13.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) but only 1.0 at alkaline pH(4.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Crystallographic data (10.Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1844-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) suggest that two metal ions such as Mn2+ and Zn2+ are associated with the enzyme; however, with Mg2+, only one metal ion was found to bind FBPase. Replacement of Gly-122 with alanine caused a 19-fold decrease in enzyme activity and a significant decrease of the enzyme's affinity for Mg2+. This is expected because the main chain NH group of Gly-122 is thought to act as a donor to form a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the O1 oxygen of the fructofuranoside ring and an oxygen of the 1-phosphoryl group of the substrate(10.Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1844-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, this bifurcated hydrogen bond is believed to anchor the 1-phosphoryl group in the required position for both metal binding and catalysis(10.Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1844-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, the bifurcated hydrogen bond may contribute to catalysis by making the phosphoester bond weaker such that nucleophilic attack by OH− on the 1-phosphorus atom would be facilitated. A significant finding associated with this report is that the Hill coefficient of the G122A mutant FBPase for Mg2+ is about 1.0. This conclusion is alluded to from kinetic data obtained in the absence of inhibitors. These results suggest that altering Gly-122 of FBPase to alanine essentially causes the complete loss of Mg2+ cooperativity. Furthermore, the affinity of this mutant form of FBPase for metal ions decreased markedly. From these results, we conclude that the Gly-122 residue of mammalian FBPase is essential for both cooperativity and binding of Mg2+ to the enzyme. An understanding of this important finding requires further investigations (e.g. solution of the crystal structure of G122A FBPase); however, modeling studies were undertaken to provide some insight into the effect of substituting alanine for glycine at position 122. Gly-122 is located in a 3-residue loop between strand B3 (residues 113-118) and helix H4 (residue 123-127). If one compares the various crystallographic complexes of FBPase, it is obvious that residues 121-127 are subject to conformational changes during catalysis(27.Liang, J.-Y., Zhang, Y., Huang, S., Ke, H., Lipscomb, W. N. (1992) Regulation of Protein by Ligands: Proceedings of the Robert A. Welch Foundation Conference on Chemical Research, October 26-27, 1992, Houston, TexasGoogle Scholar) : root mean square deviation for backbone atoms of these residues ranges between 0.29 and 0.70 Å (between native FBPase and FBPase complexed with Fru-1,6-P2, with α-methyl-Fru-1,6-P2, or with Fru-6-P, respectively). Most interestingly, Gly-122 is at a hinge point between strand B3 and helix H4. The active site region of FBPase, based on the crystal structure of the enzyme(10.Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1844-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), is shown in Fig. 4. If Gly-122 (Fig. 4A) is replaced by Ala-122 (Fig. 4B), the β-methyl group is located in the Fru-1,6-P2 binding site, close to the C1 carbon of the substrate or its analog. Ala-122 can reduce the flexibility of the 122-127 region or lock the enzyme in a conformation which suppresses cooperativity for Mg2+. In addition, binding of Mg2+ causes repositioning of the 1-phosphoryl group of Fru-1,6-P2 or its analog, α-methyl Fru-1,6-P2(27.Liang, J.-Y., Zhang, Y., Huang, S., Ke, H., Lipscomb, W. N. (1992) Regulation of Protein by Ligands: Proceedings of the Robert A. Welch Foundation Conference on Chemical Research, October 26-27, 1992, Houston, TexasGoogle Scholar). Based on these structural studies, the following events can be proposed: when the substrate binds, the 1-phosphoryl group adopts an initial conformation. The binding of Mg2+ in the metal site moves the 1-phosphoryl group into a position that allows cleavage of the P-O bond, yielding the formation of Fru-6-P. The β-methyl group of Ala-122 can lock the 1-phosphoryl group in a defined conformation when substrate binds and this affects the hinge movement of helix H4, disrupting some interactions that are required for signal transmission between monomers. It is well documented that the mechanism of regulation of FBPase involves AMP and Fru-2,6-P2, which are potent synergistic inhibitors of the enzyme(28.Chen M. Chen L. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5554-5558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Van Schaftingen E. Hue L. Hers H.G. Biochem.

Biol. 1990; 212: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have shown that AMP and metal ions are mutually exclusive in their binding to the enzyme. X-ray diffraction studies suggested that the metal binding sites are far from the allosteric sites for AMP(32.Pilkis S.J. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis J. Claus T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3619-3622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data shown in Table 1 indicate that the Ki for AMP of the G122A mutant is much higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. It is obvious that converting Gly-122 to alanine not only affects the enzyme's affinity for divalent metal ions, it also affects the enzyme's affinity for AMP. These results are consistent with previous suggestions that the metal binding sites and the allosteric sites for AMP can somehow communicate with each other(4.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9122-9128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Chen M. Chen L. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5554-5558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When AMP binds to the enzyme, the coordination sphere of Mg2+ is affected as follows; side chains of residues Glu-97, Asp-118, and Asp-121 belonging to strand B3 move from their R state conformation 1.79 Å (OE1), 1.71 Å (OD2), and 4.10 Å (OD1). Residues Lys-274 and Glu-280 are also affected upon binding(27.Liang, J.-Y., Zhang, Y., Huang, S., Ke, H., Lipscomb, W. N. (1992) Regulation of Protein by Ligands: Proceedings of the Robert A. Welch Foundation Conference on Chemical Research, October 26-27, 1992, Houston, TexasGoogle Scholar). From our results, Gly-122, located in the hinge region between strand B3 and helix H4, seems to be directly involved in the signal transmission pathway for communication between metal binding sites and allosteric sites. The binding of AMP to wild-type FBPase exhibits cooperativity(28.Chen M. Chen L. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5554-5558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis at the AMP binding site led to a total loss of cooperativity for AMP with FBPase(28.Chen M. Chen L. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5554-5558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic data of AMP inhibition with G122A FBPase gave excellent fits to a cooperative model. This finding suggests that the Gly-122 residue may not be involved in the cooperativity of AMP, although it is absolutely required for Mg2+ cooperativity. It is believed that Fru-2,6-P2 has two functions in regulating FBPase. One is that it is a potent competitive inhibitor of the substrate and competes with Fru-1,6-P2 at the enzyme's active site(24.Ke H. Thorpe C.M. Seaton B.A. Marcus F. Lipcomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25.Ke H. Thorpe C.M. Seaton B.A. Lipscomb W.N. Marcus F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31.Van Schaftingen E. Hers H.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 1524-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33.Ke H. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5243-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The second function is to enhance the effect of AMP by making AMP “stickier” to the enzyme(7.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9122-9128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AMP is known to be a potent competitive inhibitor of Mg2+(28.Chen M. Chen L. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5554-5558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to prevent divalent metal ion binding to the enzyme, i.e. the two ligands are mutually exclusive in their binding to FBPase. The findings of this report demonstrate that Gly-122 is essential for the well established cooperativity and divalent metal binding affinity of porcine liver FBPase. The x-ray diffraction investigations of FBPase by the Lipscomb group (34.Ganson N.J. Fromm H.J Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) has provided a basis for AMP cooperativity. The enzyme functions as a dimer of dimers in which R and T states exist. In the case of AMP binding, the T state is induced, whereas the substrate adds to the R state of the enzyme. This model provides a rational explanation for a Hill coefficient of 2 for AMP. On the other hand, an explanation of divalent metal ion binding seems to be less well understood. Two binding sites for either Mn2+ or Zn2+ have been demonstrated; however, the x-ray diffraction studies can pinpoint only a single Mg2+ ion per monomer. In addition, kinetic studies at pH 9.6 (4.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) accord with the latter finding, i.e. only 1 Mg2+ per monomer and no cooperativity. It is well established that at neutral pH, Mg2+ binding is cooperative and the Hill coefficient is 2(11.Benkovic S.J. deMaine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15.Tejwani G. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 121-193PubMed Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 3 confirm this finding. The origin of Mg2+ binding cooperativity remains unclear even though the metal binding sites of FBPase were markedly altered by site-directed mutagenesis(16.Chen L. Remesh H. Chen M. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although the k cat of the mutant FBPase was decreased by at least 3 orders of magnitude relative to the wild-type enzyme, the cooperativity of metal ions did not show significant alteration(16.Chen L. Remesh H. Chen M. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These results suggest, but do not provide conclusive proof, that divalent metal ion cooperativity is inter- rather than intrasubunit. The results of the present study may lead to a better understanding of the basis of the cooperativity phenomenon for metal ion binding to FBPase at the molecular level when the three-dimensional structure of the Gly-122 mutant becomes available.
