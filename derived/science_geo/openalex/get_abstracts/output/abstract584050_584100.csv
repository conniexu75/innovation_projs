https://openalex.org/W2604671211,"Genomic regions responsible for accumulation of grain iron concentration (Fe), grain zinc concentration (Zn), grain protein content (PC) and thousand kernel weight (TKW) were investigated in 286 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between an old Indian wheat variety WH542 and a synthetic derivative (Triticum dicoccon PI94624/Aegilops squarrosa [409]//BCN). RILs were grown in six environments and evaluated for Fe, Zn, PC, and TKW. The population showed the continuous distribution for all the four traits, that for pooled Fe and PC was near normal, whereas, for pooled Zn, RILs exhibited positively skewed distribution. A genetic map spanning 2155.3cM was constructed using microsatellite markers covering the 21 chromosomes and used for QTL analysis. 16 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified in this study. Four QTLs (QGFe.iari-2A, QGFe.iari-5A, QGFe.iari-7A and QGFe.iari-7B) for Fe, five QTLs (QGZn.iari-2A, QGZn.iari-4A, QGZn.iari-5A, QGZn.iari-7A and QGZn.iari-7B) for Zn, two QTLs (QGpc.iari-2A and QGpc.iari-3A) for PC, and five QTLs (QTkw.iari-1A, QTkw.iari-2A, QTkw.iari-2B, QTkw.iari-5B and QTkw.iari-7A) for TKW were identified. The QTLs together explained 20.0%, 32.0%, 24.1% and 32.3% phenotypic variation, respectively, for Fe, Zn, PC and TKW. QGpc.iari-2A was consistently expressed in all the six environments, whereas, QGFe.iari-7B and QGZn.iari-2A were identified in two environments each apart from pooled mean. QTkw.iari-2A and QTkw.iari-7A, respectively, were identified in four and three environments apart from pooled mean. A common region in the interval of Xgwm359-Xwmc407 on chromosome 2A was associated with Fe, Zn, and PC. One more QTL for TKW was identified on chromosome 2A but in a different chromosomal region (Xgwm382-Xgwm359). Two more regions on 5A (Xgwm126-Xgwm595) and 7A (Xbarc49-Xwmc525) were found to be associated with both Fe and Zn. A QTL for TKW was identified (Xwmc525-Xbarc222) in a different chromosomal region on the same chromosome (7A). This reflects at least a partly common genetic basis for the four traits. It is concluded that fine mapping of the regions of the three chromosomes of A genome involved in determining the accumulation of Fe, Zn, PC, and TKW in this mapping population may be rewarding."
https://openalex.org/W2604927309,"Home range size is a fundamental concept for understanding animal dispersion and ecological needs, and it is one of the most commonly reported ecological attributes of free-ranging mammals. Previous studies indicate that red foxes Vulpes vulpes display great variability in home range size. Yet, there has been little consensus regarding the reasons why home range sizes of red foxes vary so extensively. In this study, we examine possible causes of variation in red fox home range sizes using data from 52 GPS collared red foxes from four study areas representing a gradient of landscape productivity and human landscape alteration in Norway and Sweden. Using 90% Local Convex Hull home range estimates, we examined how red fox home range size varied in relation to latitude, elevation, vegetation zone, proportion of agricultural land and human settlement within a home range, and sex and age. We found considerable variation in red fox home range sizes, ranging between 0.95 km2 to 44 km2 (LoCoH 90%) and 2.4 km2 to 358 km2 (MCP 100%). Elevation, proportion of agricultural land and sex accounted for 50% of the variation in home range size found amongst foxes, with elevation having the strongest effect. Red foxes residing in more productive landscapes (those in more southern vegetation zones), had home ranges approximately four times smaller than the home ranges of foxes in the northern boreal vegetation zone. Our results indicate that home range size was influenced by a productivity gradient at both the landscape (latitude) and the local (elevation) scale. The influence of the proportion of agriculture land on home range size of foxes illustrates how human landscape alteration can affect the space use and distribution of red foxes. Further, the variation in home range size found in this study demonstrates the plasticity of red foxes to respond to changing human landscape alteration as well as changes in landscape productivity, which may be contributing to red fox population increases and northern range expansions."
https://openalex.org/W2604222516,"Cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides are established for risk stratification in light-chain amyloidosis. Data on cardiac biomarkers in transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) are lacking.Patients (n = 1617) with any of the following cardiac biomarkers, BNP (n = 1079), NT-proBNP (n = 550), troponin T (n = 274), and troponin I (n = 108), available at baseline in the Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey (THAOS) were analyzed for differences between genotypes and phenotypes and their association with survival. Median level of BNP was 68.0 pg/mL (IQR 30.5-194.9), NT-proBNP 337.9 pg/mL (IQR 73.0-2584.0), troponin T 0.03 μg/L (IQR 0.01-0.05), and troponin I 0.08 μg/L (IQR 0.04-0.13). NT-proBNP and BNP were higher in wild-type than mutant-type ATTR, troponin T and I did not differ, respectively. Non-Val30Met patients had higher BNP, NT-proBNP and troponin T levels than Val30Met patients, but not troponin I. Late-onset Val30Met was associated with higher levels of troponin I and troponin T compared with early-onset. 115 patients died during a median follow-up of 1.2 years. Mortality increased with increasing quartiles (BNP/NT-proBNP Q1 = 1.7%, Q2 = 5.2%, Q3 = 21.7%, Q4 = 71.3%; troponin T/I Q1 = 6.5%, Q2 = 14.5%, Q3 = 33.9%, Q4 = 45.2%). Three-year overall-survival estimates for BNP/NT-proBNP and troponin T/I quartiles differed significantly (p<0.001). Stepwise risk stratification was achieved by combining NT-proBNP/BNP and troponin T/I. From Cox proportional hazards model, age, modified body mass index, mutation (Val30Met vs. Non-Val30Met) and BNP/NT-proBNP (Q1-Q3 pooled vs. Q4) were identified as independent predictors of survival in patients with mutant-type ATTR.In this ATTR patient cohort, cardiac biomarkers were abnormal in a substantial percentage of patients irrespective of genotype. Along with age, mBMI, and mutation (Val30Met vs. Non-Val30Met), cardiac biomarkers were associated with surrogates of disease severity with BNP/NT-proBNP identified as an independent predictor of survival in ATTR.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00628745."
https://openalex.org/W2604724976,"Our main objective was to investigate the association between duration of active labor and severe postpartum hemorrhage. We examined the effect of the total duration of active labor, the effect of each stage of active labor, and the gradient effect of duration of labor on severe postpartum hemorrhage.A case-control study was generated from a source population of all women admitted for delivery at Oslo University Hospital and Drammen Hospital in Buskerud municipality during the time period January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2011. The study population included all cases of severe postpartum hemorrhage (n = 859) and a random sample of controls (n = 1755). Severe postpartum hemorrhage was defined as postpartum blood loss ≥1500 mL or need for blood transfusion. Prolonged labor was defined as duration of active labor >12 hours according to the definition of the World Health Organization. We used logistic multivariable regression in the analysis.We observed a significantly longer mean duration of labor in women who experienced severe postpartum hemorrhage compared to controls (5.4 versus 3.8 hours, p<0.001). Women with severe postpartum hemorrhage also had a longer duration of all stages of active labor compared to controls. The association between the duration of active labor and severe postpartum changed from a linear dose-response association to a threshold association after adjusting for augmentation with oxytocin, induction of labor, primiparity, and fever during labor. Compared to controls, women with severe postpartum hemorrhage were more likely to have a prolonged labor >12 hours (adjusted odds ratio = 2.44, 95% confidence interval: 1.69-3.53, p< 0.001).Prolonged active labor (duration >12 hours) was associated with severe postpartum hemorrhage. Increased vigilance seems required when the labor is prolonged to reduce the risk of severe postpartum hemorrhage."
https://openalex.org/W2604178331,"A prospective laboratory-based multicenter study that collected all adult invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) episodes from 6 Spanish hospitals before (2008–2009) and after (2012–2013). The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) licensure was conducted in order to analyze the impact of PCV13 introduction for children on adult IPD. A total of 1558 IPD episodes were detected. The incidence of IPD decreased significantly in the second period by -33.9% (95% CI, -40.3% to -26.8%). IPD due to PCV7 serotypes (-52.7%; 95% CI, -64.2% to -37.5%) and to PCV13 additional serotypes (-55.0% 95% CI, -62.0% to -46.7%) significantly decreased whereas IPD due to non-PCV13 serotypes remained stable (1.0% 95% CI, -12.9% to 17.2%). IPD due to all PCV13 additional serotypes significantly declined with the exception of serotype 3 (-11.3%; 95%CI -35.0% to 21.1%). IPD due to two non-PCV13 serotypes varied: serotype 6C that rose (301.6%; 95%CI, 92.7% to 733.3%, p<0.001), related to the expansion of ST3866C, and serotype 8 that decreased (-34.9%, 95%CI, -57.1 to -1.2, p = 0.049), related to a decline of the ST638. The recombinant clone ST652111A (variant of ST1569V) increased in frequency. The decrease of serotype 19A IPD was linked to a fall in those antibiotic susceptible clones. In the last period, rates of penicillin- and cefotaxime-resistance remained under 10% and 4%, respectively. Adult IPD decreased after the PCV13 introduction in Spain due to herd protection. The spread of multidrug resistant clones (ST3866C, ST652111A) related to non-PCV13 serotypes needs further surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2605259187,"Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging promising paradigm for network management because of its centralized network intelligence. However, the centralized control architecture of the software-defined networks (SDNs) brings novel challenges of reliability, scalability, fault tolerance and interoperability. In this paper, we proposed a novel clustered distributed controller architecture in the real setting of SDNs. The distributed cluster implementation comprises of multiple popular SDN controllers. The proposed mechanism is evaluated using a real world network topology running on top of an emulated SDN environment. The result shows that the proposed distributed controller clustering mechanism is able to significantly reduce the average latency from 8.1% to 1.6%, the packet loss from 5.22% to 4.15%, compared to distributed controller without clustering running on HP Virtual Application Network (VAN) SDN and Open Network Operating System (ONOS) controllers respectively. Moreover, proposed method also shows reasonable CPU utilization results. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism makes possible to handle unexpected load fluctuations while maintaining a continuous network operation, even when there is a controller failure. The paper is a potential contribution stepping towards addressing the issues of reliability, scalability, fault tolerance, and inter-operability."
https://openalex.org/W2604793342,"We propose a mesh-free and discrete (particle-based) multi-physics approach for modelling the hydrodynamics in flexible biological valves. In the first part of this study, the method is successfully validated against both traditional modelling techniques and experimental data. In the second part, it is further developed to account for the formation of solid aggregates in the flow and at the membrane surface. Simulations of various types of aggregates highlight the main benefits of discrete multi-physics and indicate the potential of this approach for coupling the hydrodynamics with phenomena such as clotting and calcification in biological valves."
https://openalex.org/W2604333404,"Prolactin (PRL) has roles in various physiological functions. Although experimental studies showed that PRL has both beneficial and adverse effects on type 2 diabetes mellitus, clinical findings in subjects with hyperprolactinemia indicate adverse effects on glucose metabolism. However, effects of PRL within the physiological range in human are controversial. A population-based study of 370 Japanese men enrolled in the 2014 Iwaki study (aged 52.0 ± 14.8 years). In this cross-sectional study, associations between serum PRL levels and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) indices representing glucose metabolism in a physiological setting were examined using multivariable regression analysis. Although univariate linear regression analyses showed significant associations between serum PRL levels and HOMA indices, adjustment with multiple factors made the association with HOMA-ß (insulin secretion) insignificant, while those with HOMA-R (insulin resistance) remained significant (ß = 0.084, p = 0.035). Non-linear regression analyses showed a regression curve with a peak at serum PRL level, 12.4 ng/mL and a positive association of serum PRL level with HOMA-R below the peak (ß = 0.119, p = 0.004). Higher serum PRL levels within the physiological range seem to be associated with insulin resistance in men."
https://openalex.org/W2605115000,"Background Exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOC) are being considered as biomarkers for various lungs diseases, including cancer. However, the accurate measurement of extremely low concentrations of VOC in expired air is technically challenging. We evaluated the clinical contribution of exhaled VOC measured with a new, double cold-trap method in the diagnosis of lung cancer. Methods Breath samples were collected from 116 patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer and 37 healthy volunteers (controls) after inspiration of purified air, synthesized through a cold-trap system. The exhaled VOC, trapped in the same system, were heat extracted. We analyzed 14 VOC with gas chromatography. Results The concentrations of exhaled cyclohexane and xylene were significantly higher in patients with lung cancer than in controls (p = 0.002 and 0.0001, respectively), increased significantly with the progression of the clinical stage of cancer (both p < 0.001), and decreased significantly after successful treatment of 6 patients with small cell lung cancer (p = 0.06 and 0.03, respectively). Conclusion Measurements of exhaled VOCs by a double cold-trap method may help diagnose lung cancer and monitor its progression and regression."
https://openalex.org/W2605047022,"Our aim was to assess the influence of age, gender and lifestyle factors on the effect of the obesity-promoting alleles of FTO and MCR4.The HUNT study comprises health information on the population of Nord-Trøndelag county, Norway. Extreme phenotype participants (gender-wise lower and upper quartiles of waist-hip-ratio and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2) in the third survey, HUNT3 (2006-08), were genotyped for the single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs9939609 (FTO) and rs17782313 (MC4R); 25686 participants were successfully genotyped. Extreme sampling was chosen to increase power to detect genetic and gene-environment effects on waist-hip-ratio and BMI. Statistical inference was based on linear regression models and a missing-covariate likelihood approach for the extreme phenotype sampling design. Environmental factors were physical activity, diet (artificially sweetened beverages) and smoking. Longitudinal analysis was performed using material from HUNT2 (1995-97).Cross-sectional and longitudinal genetic effects indicated stronger genetic associations with obesity in young than in old, as well as differences between women and men. We observed larger genetic effects among physically inactive compared to active individuals. This interaction was age-dependent and seen mainly in 20-40 year olds. We observed a greater FTO effect among men with a regular intake of artificially sweetened beverages, compared to non-drinkers. Interaction analysis of smoking was mainly inconclusive.In a large all-adult and area-based population survey the effects of obesity-promoting minor-alleles of FTO and MCR4, and interactions with life style factors are age- and gender-related. These findings appear relevant when designing individualized treatment for and prophylaxis against obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2605346675,"HTLV-1 infection is associated with several inflammatory disorders, including the neurodegenerative condition HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). It is unclear why a minority of infected subjects develop HAM/TSP. The cellular immune response has been implicated in the development of inflammatory alterations in these patients; however the pathogenic mechanisms for disease progression remain unclear. Furthermore, HTLV-1-infected individuals have an increase incidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, suggesting that immunological defect are associated with HTLV-1 infection. Evidence suggests an important role for Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in the early control of Mtb infection. Chronic viral infections like HIV and HCV have been associated with decreased frequency and functionality of MAIT cells. We hypothesized that HTLV-1 infection is associated with similar perturbations in MAIT cells. We investigated MAIT cell frequency, phenotype, and function by flow cytometry in a cohort of 10 asymptomatic and 10 HAM/TSP HTLV-1 infected patients. We found that MAIT cells from HTLV-1-infected subjects were reduced and showed high co-expression of the activation markers CD38 and HLA-DR but normal levels of CCR6 and CD127. MAIT cells had a lower expression of the transcription factor PLZF in HAM/TSP patients. Unlike Tax-specific CD8+T cells, which are hyperfunctional, MAIT cells from HTLV-1-infected subjects had a poor IFNγ response following antigen stimulation. MAIT cell perturbations in HTLV-1 infection were not associated with HTLV-1 proviral load and MAIT cells were not infected by HTLV-1 in vivo. Rather, MAIT cells loss was associated with immune activation. Overall, our results do not support a role for MAIT cells in HAM/TSP pathogenesis but reduced numbers of MAIT cells, together with their poor functionality, could contribute to the increased susceptibility of HTLV-1-infected individuals to other infectious agents."
https://openalex.org/W2604229370,"Background Clinical trials that evaluate new anti-tubercular drugs and treatment regimens take years to complete due to the slow clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and the lack of early biomarkers that predict treatment outcomes. Host Inflammation markers have been associated with tuberculosis (TB) pathogenesis. In the present study, we tested if circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin reflect mycobacterial loads and inflammation in pulmonary TB (PTB) patients undergoing anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT). Methods Prospective measurements of CRP and ferritin, used as readouts of systemic inflammation, were performed in cryopreserved serum samples from 165 Brazilian patients with active PTB initiating ATT. Associations between levels of these laboratory parameters with mycobacterial loads in sputum as well as with sputum conversion at day 60 of ATT were tested. Results Circulating levels of both ferritin and CRP gradually decreased over time on ATT. At pre-treatment, concentrations of these parameters were unable to distinguish patients with positive from those with negative acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in sputum cultures. However, patients who remained with positive cultures at day 60 of ATT exhibited heightened levels of these inflammatory markers compared to those with negative cultures at that time point. Conclusions CRP and Ferritin levels in serum may be useful to identify patients with positive cultures at day 60 of ATT."
https://openalex.org/W2604935396,"Purpose of this study was to investigate firstly specific proteomic changes within the retina in the course of an animal glaucoma model and to identify secondly new approaches for neuroprotective, therapeutic options in glaucoma by addressing those specific changes. Intraocular pressure was elevated through cauterization of episcleral veins in adult Sprague Dawley rats. Molecular and morphological changes were surveyed using mass spectrometry, optical coherence tomography as well as immunohistochemical cross section- and flat mount stainings. By quantifying more than 1500 retinal proteins, it was found that the HspB5 protein and numerous beta-crystallins showed a uniform and unique shifting expression pattern as a result of different periods of elevated IOP exposure. Crystallins showed a significant downregulation (p<0.05) after 3 weeks of elevated IOP and an upregulation after 7 weeks. Counteracting those typical changes, an intravitreal injection of β-crystallin B2 at the time of IOP elevation was found to reduce retinal ganglion cell loss (p<0.05), decrease of the retinal nerve fiber layer (p<0.05) and impairment of the optic nerve. Ultimately, proteomic data revealed that β-crystallin B2 might influence calcium-depended cell signaling pathways with severe effect on apoptosis and gene regulation. In this context especially annexin A5, calcium-transporting ATPase 1 and various histone proteins seem to play a major role."
https://openalex.org/W2604974922,"Nicotine modulates multiple inflammatory responses in the lung through the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtype alpha7 (α7). Previously we reported that α7 modulates both the hematopoietic and epithelium responses in the lung to the bacterial inflammogen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here we apply immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and RNA-Seq analysis of isolated distal lung epithelium to further define α7-expression and function in this tissue. Mouse lines were used that co-express a bicistronic tau-green fluorescent protein (tGFP) as a reporter of α7 (α7G) expression and that harbor an α7 with a specific point mutation (α7E260A:G) that selectively uncouples it from cell calcium-signaling mechanisms. The tGFP reporter reveals strong cell-specific α7-expression by alveolar macrophages (AM), Club cells and ATII cells. Ciliated cells do not express detectible tGFP, but their numbers decrease by one-third in the α7E260A:G lung compared to controls. Transcriptional comparisons (RNA-Seq) between α7G and α7E260A:G enriched lung epithelium 24 hours after challenge with either intra-nasal (i.n.) saline or LPS reveals a robust α7-genotype impact on both the stasis and inflammatory response of this tissue. Overall the α7E260A:G lung epithelium exhibits reduced inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression to i.n. LPS. Transcripts specific to Club cells (e.g., CC10, secretoglobins and Muc5b) or to ATII cells (e.g., surfactant proteins) were constitutively decreased in in the α7E260A:G lung, but they were strongly induced in response to i.n. LPS. Protein analysis applying immunohistochemistry and ELISA also revealed α7-associated differences suggested by RNA-Seq including altered mucin protein 5b (Muc5b) accumulation in the α7E260A:G bronchia, that in some cases appeared to form airway plugs, and a substantial increase in extracellular matrix deposits around α7E260A:G airway bronchia linings that was not seen in controls. Our results show that α7 is an important modulator of normal gene expression stasis and the response to an inhaled inflammogen in the distal lung epithelium. Further, when normal α7 signaling is disrupted, changes in lung gene expression resemble those associated with long-term lung pathologies seen in humans who use inhaled nicotine products."
https://openalex.org/W2604781229,"Background Cancers of the oral cavity are primarily oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). Many of the OSCCs present at late stages with an exceptionally poor prognosis. A probable limitation in management of patients with OSCC lies in the insufficient knowledge pertaining to the linkage between copy number alterations in OSCC and oral tumourigenesis thereby resulting in an inability to deliver targeted therapy. Objectives The current study aimed to identify copy number alterations (CNAs) in OSCC using array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) and to correlate the CNAs with clinico-pathologic parameters and clinical outcomes. Materials and methods Using array CGH, genome-wide profiling was performed on 75 OSCCs. Selected genes that were harboured in the frequently amplified and deleted regions were validated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Thereafter, pathway and network functional analysis were carried out using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Results Multiple chromosomal regions including 3q, 5p, 7p, 8q, 9p, 10p, 11q were frequently amplified, while 3p and 8p chromosomal regions were frequently deleted. These findings were in confirmation with our previous study using ultra-dense array CGH. In addition, amplification of 8q, 11q, 7p and 9p and deletion of 8p chromosomal regions showed a significant correlation with clinico-pathologic parameters such as the size of the tumour, metastatic lymph nodes and pathological staging. Co-amplification of 7p, 8q, 9p and 11q regions that harbored amplified genes namely CCND1, EGFR, TPM2 and LRP12 respectively, when combined, continues to be an independent prognostic factor in OSCC. Conclusion Amplification of 3q, 5p, 7p, 8q, 9p, 10p, 11q and deletion of 3p and 8p chromosomal regions were recurrent among OSCC patients. Co-alteration of 7p, 8q, 9p and 11q was found to be associated with clinico-pathologic parameters and poor survival. These regions contain genes that play critical roles in tumourigenesis pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2604622232,"China has high burden on both of tuberculosis (TB) and tobacco use. This study aims to explore the potential link between smoking and TB infection using baseline survey data of a large-scale population-based prospective study in rural China.Between July 1 and Sept 30, 2013, based on the baseline survey of a population-based, prospective study in rural China, the relationship between smoking and TB infection, assessed by interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA), was investigated among the total study population and only among those smokers, respectively.A total of 21,008 eligible rural registered residents (≥ 5 years old) from 4 rural sites were included in the analysis. Ever-smokers were more likely to be QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) positive than never smokers with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.34 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-1.49). Among ever smokers, a significant linear dose-response relation was observed between duration of smoking (by years) and QFT positivity (p < 0.001). Stratified analysis suggested that such an association was not influenced by gender and age. Evidence for interaction of smoking status with age was found.Our results provide further evidence to support smoking might increase host susceptibility to TB infection. Populations under high risk of infection, such as elderly smokers, should be prior to TB infection controlling under a premise of community level intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2605056859,"H9N2 avian influenza viruses are endemic in poultry in Asia and the Middle East. These viruses sporadically cause dead-end infections in pigs and humans raising concerns about their potential to adapt to mammals or reassort with human or swine influenza viruses. We performed ten serial passages with an avian H9N2 virus (A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/1997) in influenza naïve pigs to assess the potential of this virus to adapt to swine. Virus replication in the entire respiratory tract and nasal virus excretion were examined after each passage and we deep sequenced viral genomic RNA of the parental and passage four H9N2 virus isolated from the nasal mucosa and lung. The parental H9N2 virus caused a productive infection in pigs with a predominant tropism for the nasal mucosa, whereas only 50% lung samples were virus-positive. In contrast, inoculation of pigs with passage four virus resulted in viral replication in the entire respiratory tract. Subsequent passages were associated with reduced virus replication in the lungs and infectious virus was no longer detectable in the upper and lower respiratory tract of inoculated pigs at passage ten. The broader tissue tropism after four passages was associated with an amino acid residue substitution at position 225, within the receptor-binding site of the hemagglutinin. We also compared the parental H9N2, passage four H9N2 and the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus in a direct contact transmission experiment. Whereas only one out of six contact pigs showed nasal virus excretion of the wild-type H9N2 for more than four days, all six contact animals shed the passage four H9N2 virus. Nevertheless, the amount of excreted virus was significantly lower when compared to that of the pH1N1, which readily transmitted and replicated in all six contact animals. Our data demonstrate that serial passaging of H9N2 virus in pigs enhances its replication and transmissibility. However, full adaptation of an avian H9N2 virus to pigs likely requires an extensive set of mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2605218312,"Mutations of the gene for nucleophosmin (NPM1) are the most frequent genetic aberration in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The mechanism of leukemic transformation in this leukemia subtype is not fully understood, but aberrant cytoplasmic localization of mutated NPM (NPMmut) is widely considered as an important factor for leukemia manifestation. We analyzed the subcellular localization of three types of NPM with a C-terminal mutation (A, B and E). Genes for the individual NPM forms were fused with a gene for one of fluorescent protein variants in plasmids, which were transfected into three cell lines with different endogenous NPM expression. Subcellular localization of the fluorescent protein-labeled NPM was further correlated with the relative expression of all NPM forms. We confirmed a high cytoplasmic expression of NPMmutA and NPMmutB whereas a substantial fraction of NPMmutE was found to be localized in nucleoli. Moreover, we revealed that the localization of fluorescently labeled NPM is affected by the interaction between various forms of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2604257611,"The intestinal nematode Trichuris trichiura is among the most common causes of human infectious disease worldwide. As for other soil-transmitted nematodes, its reproductive success and thus prevalence and intensity of infection in a given area strongly depend on environmental conditions. Characterization of the influence of environmental factors can therefore aid to identify infection hot spots for targeted mass treatment.We analyzed data from a cross-sectional survey including 6234 participants from nine distinct study sites in Mbeya region, Tanzania. A geographic information system was used to combine remotely sensed and individual data, which were analyzed using uni- and multivariable Poisson regression. Household clustering was accounted for and when necessary, fractional polynomials were used to capture non-linear relationships between T. trichiura infection prevalence and environmental variables.T. trichiura infection was restricted to the Kyela site, close to Lake Nyasa with only very few cases in the other eight sites. The prevalence of T. trichiura infection in Kyela was 26.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 23.9 to 29.6%). Multivariable models revealed a positive association of infection with denser vegetation (prevalence ratio (PR) per 0.1 EVI units = 2.12, CI 1.28 to 3.50) and inverse associations with rainfall (PR per 100 mm = 0.54, CI 0.44 to 0.67) and elevation (PR per meter = 0.89, CI 0.86 to 0.93) while adjusting for age and previous worm treatment. Slope of the terrain was modelled non-linearly and also showed a positive association with T. trichiura infection (p-value p<0.001).Higher prevalences of T. trichiura infection were only found in Kyela, a study site characterized by denser vegetation, high rainfall, low elevation and flat terrain. But even within this site, we found significant influences of vegetation density, rainfall, elevation and slope on T. trichiura infection. The inverse association of rainfall with infection in Kyela is likely due to the fact, that rainfall in this site is beyond the optimum conditions for egg development.

But, a consequence is that HPβCD can cause hearing loss. HPβCD was recently found to be toxic to outer hair cells (OHCs) in the organ of Corti. Previous studies on the chronic effects of in vivo HPβCD toxicity did not know the intra-cochlear concentration of HPβCD and attributed variable effects on OHCs to indirect drug delivery to the cochlea. We studied the acute effects of known HPβCD concentrations administered directly into intact guinea pig cochleae. Our novel approach injected solutions through pipette sealed into scala tympani in the cochlear apex. Solutions were driven along the length of the cochlear spiral toward the cochlear aqueduct in the base. This method ensured that therapeutic levels were achieved throughout the cochlea, including those regions tuned to mid to low frequencies and code speech vowels and background noise. A wide variety of measurements were made. Results were compared to measurements from ears treated with the HPβCD analog methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), salicylate that is well known to attenuate the gain of the cochlear amplifier, and injection of artificial perilymph alone (controls). Histological data showed that OHCs appeared normal after treatment with a low dose of HPβCD, and physiological data was consistent with attenuation of cochlear amplifier gain and disruption of non-linearity associated with transferring acoustic sound into neural excitation, an origin of distortion products that are commonly used to objectively assess hearing and hearing loss. A high dose of HPβCD caused sporadic OHC losses and markedly affected all physiologic measurements. MβCD caused virulent destruction of OHCs and physiologic responses. Toxicity of HPβCD to OHC along the cochlear length is variable even when a known intra-cochlear concentration is administered, at least for the duration of our acute studies."
https://openalex.org/W2604640808,"Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that activity patterns in early visual areas predict stimulus properties actively maintained in visual working memory. Yet, the mechanisms by which such information is represented remain largely unknown. In this study, observers remembered the orientations of 4 briefly presented gratings, one in each quadrant of the visual field. A 10Hz Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) triplet was applied directly at stimulus offset, or midway through a 2-second delay, targeting early visual cortex corresponding retinotopically to a sample item in the lower hemifield. Memory for one of the four gratings was probed at random, and participants reported this orientation via method of adjustment. Recall errors were smaller when the visual field location targeted by TMS overlapped with that of the cued memory item, compared to errors for stimuli probed diagonally to TMS. This implied topographic storage of orientation information, and a memory-enhancing effect at the targeted location. Furthermore, early pulses impaired performance at all four locations, compared to late pulses. Next, response errors were fit empirically using a mixture model to characterize memory precision and guess rates. Memory was more precise for items proximal to the pulse location, irrespective of pulse timing. Guesses were more probable with early TMS pulses, regardless of stimulus location. Thus, while TMS administered at the offset of the stimulus array might disrupt early-phase consolidation in a non-topographic manner, TMS also boosts the precise representation of an item at its targeted retinotopic location, possibly by increasing attentional resources or by injecting a beneficial amount of noise."
https://openalex.org/W2605171064,"As an ecological unit, coarse woody debris (CWD) plays an essential role in productivity, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, community regeneration and biodiversity. However, thus far, the information on quantification the decomposition and nutrient content of CWD in forest ecosystems remains considerably limited. In this study, we conducted a long-term (1996–2013) study on decay and nutrient dynamics of CWD for evaluating accurately the ecological value of CWD on the Huoditang Experimental Forest Farm in the Qinling Mountains, China. The results demonstrated that there was a strong correlation between forest biomass and CWD mass. The single exponential decay model well fit the CWD density loss at this site, and as the CWD decomposed, the CWD density decreased significantly. Annual temperature and precipitation were all significantly correlated with the annual mass decay rate. The K contents and the C/N ratio of the CWD decreased as the CWD decayed, but the C, N, P, Ca and Mg contents increased. We observed a significant CWD decay effect on the soil C, N and Mg contents, especially the soil C content. The soil N, P, K, Ca and Mg contents exhibited large fluctuations, but the variation had no obvious regularity and changed with different decay times. The results showed that CWD was a critical component of nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Further research is needed to determine the effect of diameter, plant tissue components, secondary wood compounds, and decomposer organisms on the CWD decay rates in the Qinling Mountains, which will be beneficial to clarifying the role of CWD in carbon cycles of forest ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2604614220,"The etiology of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) remains unclear. Possible causes of SSNHL include vascular diseases, viral infection, and autoimmune disorders. Therefore, we investigated whether hepatitis virus infection is correlated with the risk of SSNHL. Using data from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, we conducted a retrospective matched-cohort study to compare patients diagnosed with hepatitis B or C virus (HBV/HCV) infections from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2010, (N = 170,942) with frequency-matched controls (N = 512,826) at a ratio of 1:3 by sex, age, and index year. We followed each patient until the end of 2010 and evaluated the incidence of SSNHL. At the end of the follow-up period, 647 (0.38%, 647/170,942) patients developed SSNHL in the HBV/HCV group compared with 978 (0.19%, 978/512,826) in the control groups, with a statistical significance of P < 0.001 (using the log-rank test). The incidence rate ratio of SSNHL was 5.743-fold higher in the HBV/HCV group than in the control group (283.17 vs. 49.31 per 100,000 person-years, P < 0.001). The risk of SSNHL increased with HBV/HCV infection, and an adjusted hazard ratio of 5.103 (95% CI, 4.585–5.678) was determined using Cox proportional hazards regression. This study contributes to the awareness of the increased risk of SSNHL in HBV/HCV-infected populations. Our findings suggest that an underlying viral infection contributes to the development of SSNHL."

Here we present a novel algorithm to find the driver nodes for target control based on preferential matching. The algorithm elaborately arrange the matching order of nodes in order to minimize the size of the driver nodes set. The results on both synthetic and real networks indicate that the performance of proposed algorithm are better than the previous one.

https://openalex.org/W2605123919,"Background Paper currency by its very nature is frequently transferred from one person to another and represents an important medium for human contact with—and potential exchange of—microbes. In this pilot study, we swabbed circulating $1 bills obtained from a New York City bank in February (Winter) and June (Summer) 2013 and used shotgun metagenomic sequencing to profile the communities found on their surface. Using basic culture conditions, we also tested whether viable microbes could be recovered from bills. Results Shotgun metagenomics identified eukaryotes as the most abundant sequences on money, followed by bacteria, viruses and archaea. Eukaryotic assemblages were dominated by human, other metazoan and fungal taxa. The currency investigated harbored a diverse microbial population that was dominated by human skin and oral commensals, including Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus. Other taxa detected not associated with humans included Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, microbes typically associated with dairy production and fermentation. Culturing results indicated that viable microbes can be isolated from paper currency. Conclusions We conducted the first metagenomic characterization of the surface of paper money in the United States, establishing a baseline for microbes found on $1 bills circulating in New York City. Our results suggest that money amalgamates DNA from sources inhabiting the human microbiome, food, and other environmental inputs, some of which can be recovered as viable organisms. These monetary communities may be maintained through contact with human skin, and DNA obtained from money may provide a record of human behavior and health. Understanding these microbial profiles is especially relevant to public health as money could potentially mediate interpersonal transfer of microbes."
https://openalex.org/W2605143705,"Effective nurse shift-to-shift handover is a prerequisite for high-quality inpatient care. Combining person-centeredness with the need for improved handover rituals, we introduced and evaluated person-centered handover (PCH) in an oncological inpatient setting. PCH is the shift-to-shift nursing report performed together with the patient according to a set structure focused on patient participation, relevant clinical information, and patient safety. Non-verbal handover, standard at the department, is conducted via the electronic health record, in absence of the patient, and without a set structure. The aim of the study was to compare person-centered handover with non-verbal handover in an oncological inpatient setting with regard to patient satisfaction. A cross-sectional design featuring two points of measurement at one intervention ward and two control wards was applied. The EORTC IN-PATSAT32 questionnaire was used for measuring patient satisfaction. Baseline measurements were taken during the spring of 2014, when all three wards used a non-verbal handover model, and included responses from 116 patients. Follow-up measurements (comparing PCH and non-verbal handover) involved 209 patients and were on-going from September 2014 to May 2015. After the introduction of PCH, one change in patient satisfaction was detected regarding the subscale measuring exchange of information between caregivers. Patients from the intervention ward scored statistically higher after the implementation of PCH when compared to the control wards (p = .0058). The difference remained after a multivariate regression analysis controlling for clinical variables. In conclusion, PCH is feasible in oncological inpatient care but does not seem to affect patient satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2605154102,"Background Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) also known as kala-azar is a growing health problem in Ethiopia with an estimated annual VL incidence between 3700 and 7400. The disease is mainly endemic in northwestern parts of the country. The aim of the current study was to determine the sand fly fauna and ecology of Phlebotomus orientalis in two endemic and ecologically distinct areas of northwestern Ethiopia. Methods Sand flies were collected using CDC light traps, sticky traps and pyrethrum spray catches from peri-domestic, mixed forest, farm field and indoor habitats from both Libo-Kemkem (May 2011-April 2012) and Metema (October 2012-September 2013) districts. Results A total of 51,411 sand fly specimens were collected and identified (10,776 from highland and 40, 635 from the lowland areas). Seven species were found in the highland area: two Phlebotomus spp. (P. orientalis and P. rodhaini) and five Sergentomyia species. Whereas 19 species were found in the lowland area: six Phlebotomus (P. orientalis, P. rodhaini, P. bergeroti, P. duboscqi, P. papatasi and P. martini) and 13 Sergentomyia species. Of the Phlebotomus spp., P. orientalis was the predominant species in both the highland (99.9%) and lowland (93.7%) areas. Indoor collections using pyrethrum spray catches and sticky traps indicated that P. orientalis has a strong exophilic and exophagic behaviors in both districts. In both areas, this species showed seasonal occurrence and showing abundance during the dry months (March-May/June) of the year and increasing in numbers till the rain season, when numbers dropped dramatically. Mean density of P. orientalis in the two areas had positive and significant correlation with mean temperature in light trap collections (P<0.05). However, mean density of P. orientalis in the two areas in sticky trap collections had positive and insignificant association with the temperature (P>0.05). Regarding the rainfall pattern, density of P. orientalis had negative and statistically insignificant correlation (for light trap collections for both areas) and significant correlation (for sticky trap collections for lowland area). Conclusions The current study indicated the variation in sand fly fauna between the highland and lowland districts, wherein, P. orientalis was found to be the most abundant Phlebotomus species. The study also determined that P. orientalis exhibits distinct seasonality, where its abundance increases during the dry season and disappears when the rainy period starts in both study areas. This entomological observation on the bionomics of P. orientalis provides significant evidence for considering vector control or preventive measures in the areas studied."
https://openalex.org/W2605205041,"We have developed a modified FlowCAM procedure for efficiently quantifying the size distribution of zooplankton. The modified method offers the following new features: 1) prevents animals from settling and clogging with constant bubbling in the sample container; 2) prevents damage to sample animals and facilitates recycling by replacing the built-in peristaltic pump with an external syringe pump, in order to generate negative pressure, creates a steady flow by drawing air from the receiving conical flask (i.e. vacuum pump), and transfers plankton from the sample container toward the main flowcell of the imaging system and finally into the receiving flask; 3) aligns samples in advance of imaging and prevents clogging with an additional flowcell placed ahead of the main flowcell. These modifications were designed to overcome the difficulties applying the standard FlowCAM procedure to studies where the number of individuals per sample is small, and since the FlowCAM can only image a subset of a sample. Our effective recycling procedure allows users to pass the same sample through the FlowCAM many times (i.e. bootstrapping the sample) in order to generate a good size distribution. Although more advanced FlowCAM models are equipped with syringe pump and Field of View (FOV) flowcells which can image all particles passing through the flow field; we note that these advanced setups are very expensive, offer limited syringe and flowcell sizes, and do not guarantee recycling. In contrast, our modifications are inexpensive and flexible. Finally, we compared the biovolumes estimated by automated FlowCAM image analysis versus conventional manual measurements, and found that the size of an individual zooplankter can be estimated by the FlowCAM image system after ground truthing."
https://openalex.org/W2605364273,"Background In patients with life-limiting conditions and a history of migration, a higher risk of not dying at home and limited access to palliative care services has been reported. Aim To explore the views and end-of-life preferences of patients with a migration history in Germany and to identify migration specific themes. Design Two-armed study using Kaufmann’s ‘understanding interview’ (‘focused interview’) method and grounded theory approach. Thematic content analysis was applied using MaxQDA 12 software. Setting/Participants Migrant and non-migrant adult patients with far advanced, life-limiting disease receiving palliative care in different specialist level settings (specialist home palliative care, palliative care inpatient unit, inpatient hospice). Results The 37 interviewees (19 native Germans and 18 patients from Europe and the U.S., Israel, Turkey, and Indonesia) expressed eleven themes covering health care- and patient-related issues, of which four emerged to be specific for migrants: worse survival in home country; the perception of an altered identity and ‘not belonging’; language skills as prerequisite to survive; and longing for ‘home’ while being attached to Germany. From these categories, three overarching themes were derived: (1) a limited understanding of the concept of ‘palliative care’; (2) the suppression of end of life discussions for its association with suffering and loss of autonomy; and (3) the significance of complex individual migration histories. Conclusions Based on these findings, the concept of a ‘double home’ experience is proposed. Barriers to access to palliative care should be minimized for all patients while cultural stereotyping has to be avoided."
https://openalex.org/W2604153693,"Cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases metabolize arachidonic acid into epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which play an important role in blood pressure regulation, protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Epoxide hydrolases metabolize EETs to their corresponding diols (dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids; DHETs) which are biologically less active. Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1, mEH) and soluble epoxide hydrolase (EPHX2, sEH) were identified >30 years ago and are capable of hydrolyzing EETs to DHETs. A novel epoxide hydrolase, EPHX3, was recently identified by sequence homology and also exhibits epoxide hydrolase activity in vitro with a substrate preference for 9,10-epoxyoctadecamonoenoic acid (EpOME) and 11,12-EET. EPHX3 is highly expressed in the skin, lung, stomach, esophagus, and tongue; however, its endogenous function is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the impact of genetic disruption of Ephx3 on fatty acid epoxide hydrolysis and EET-related physiology in mice. Ephx3-/- mice were generated by excising the promoter and first four exons of the Ephx3 gene using Cre-LoxP methodology. LC-MS/MS analysis of Ephx3-/- heart, lung, and skin lysates revealed no differences in endogenous epoxide:diol ratios compared to wild type (WT). Ephx3-/- mice also exhibited no change in plasma levels of fatty acid epoxides and diols relative to WT. Incubations of cytosolic and microsomal fractions prepared from Ephx3-/- and WT stomach, lung, and skin with synthetic 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, and 9,10-EpOME revealed no significant differences in rates of fatty acid diol formation between the genotypes. Ephx3-/- hearts had similar functional recovery compared to WT hearts following ischemia/reperfusion injury. Following intranasal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure, Ephx3-/- mice were not different from WT in terms of lung histology, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cell counts, or fatty acid epoxide and diol levels. We conclude that genetic disruption of Ephx3 does not result in an overt phenotype and has no significant effects on the metabolism of EETs or EpOMEs in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2604595176,"Background Sleep complaints are prevalent in older patients. Sleepiness, short or long sleep duration and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are associated with insulin resistance (IR). These parameters have not yet been considered together in the same study exploring the possible association between IR and sleep in older patients. IR is involved in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, pathologies which are highly prevalent in older patients. Here we assess, in older non-diabetic patients with sleep complaints, the associations between IR and sleep parameters objectively recorded by polysomnography (PSG) rather than self-report. The Growth Hormone/Insulin like growth factor-1 axis could play a role in the development of IR during sleep disorders. The second objective of this study was to analyze the association between sleep parameters and age-adjusted IGF-1 score, which could explain the association between OSA and IR. Methods 72 non-diabetic older patients, mean age 74.5 ± 7.8 years, were included in this observational study. We evaluated anthropometric measures, subjective and objective sleepiness, polysomnography, Homeostatic Model Assessment for IR (HOMA-IR) and age-adjusted IGF-1 score. A multivariate regression was used to determine factors associated with HOMA-IR. Results The 47 OSA patients were over-weight but not obese and had higher IR than the non-OSA patients. In multilinear regression analysis, apnea-hypopnea index was independently associated with IR after adjustment for several confounding factors. Neither IGF-1 level nor IGF-1 score were different in the two groups. Conclusions We demonstrate that in non-diabetic older patients with sleep complaints, OSA is independently associated with IR, regardless of anthropometric measurements and sleep parameters (sleep duration/sleepiness/arousals). Targeting OSA to reduce IR could be useful in the elderly, although further exploration is required."
https://openalex.org/W2604205578,"The machine learning-based virtual screening of molecular databases is a commonly used approach to identify hits. However, many aspects associated with training predictive models can influence the final performance and, consequently, the number of hits found. Thus, we performed a systematic study of the simultaneous influence of the proportion of negatives to positives in the testing set, the size of screening databases and the type of molecular representations on the effectiveness of classification. The results obtained for eight protein targets, five machine learning algorithms (SMO, Naïve Bayes, Ibk, J48 and Random Forest), two types of molecular fingerprints (MACCS and CDK FP) and eight screening databases with different numbers of molecules confirmed our previous findings that increases in the ratio of negative to positive training instances greatly influenced most of the investigated parameters of the ML methods in simulated virtual screening experiments. However, the performance of screening was shown to also be highly dependent on the molecular library dimension. Generally, with the increasing size of the screened database, the optimal training ratio also increased, and this ratio can be rationalized using the proposed cost-effectiveness threshold approach. To increase the performance of machine learning-based virtual screening, the training set should be constructed in a way that considers the size of the screening database."
https://openalex.org/W2604307519,"Objective To compare two perspective taking strategies on (i) clinicians’ ability to accurately identify negative thoughts and feelings of parents of children with cancer, and (ii) clinician distress. Methods Sixty-three hematology-oncology professionals and nursing students watched a video featuring parents of children with cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In the imagine-self group, they were instructed to imagine the feelings and life consequences which they would experience if they were in the parents’ position. In the imagine-other group, they were instructed to imagine the feelings and life consequences experienced by the parents. Parent-clinician agreement on thoughts/feelings was evaluated (standard stimulus paradigm). Clinician distress was also assessed. Results The intervention was effective in manipulating perspective type. The groups did not significantly differ on parent-clinician agreement. Concentrating on personal feelings (imagine-self strategy) did predict lower agreement when controlling for trait empathy. Clinician distress was higher in the imagine-self group. Conclusion Although the link between perspective type and detection of distress remains unclear, the results suggest that clinicians who highly focus on their own feelings tend to be less accurate on parental distress and experience more distress themselves. Practice implications This research could potentially improve communication training and burnout prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2605162569,"Cardiopulmonary assessment through oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) data has shown encouraging results, revealing that we can obtain important clinical information about functional status. Until now, the use of OUES has not been established as a measure of cardiorespiratory capacity in an obese adult population, only in cardiac and pulmonary diseases or pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to characterize submaximal and maximal levels of OUES in a sample of morbidly obese women and analyze its relationship with traditional measures of cardiorespiratory fitness, anthropometry and pulmonary function. Thirty-three morbidly obese women (age 39.1 ± 9.2 years) performed Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPX) on a treadmill using the ramp protocol. In addition, anthropometric measurements and pulmonary function were also evaluated. Maximal and submaximal OUES were measured, being calculated from data obtained in the first 50% (OUES50%) and 75% (OUES75%) of total CPX duration. In one-way ANOVA analysis, OUES did not significantly differ between the three different exercise intensities, as observed through a Bland-Altman concordance of 58.9 mL/min/log(L/min) between OUES75% and OUES100%, and 0.49 mL/kg/min/log(l/min) between OUES/kg75% and OUES/kg100%. A strong positive correlation between the maximal (r = 0.79) and submaximal (r = 0.81) OUES/kg with oxygen consumption at peak exercise (VO2peak) and ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VO2VAT) was observed, and a moderate negative correlation with hip circumference (r = -0.46) and body adiposity index (r = -0.50) was also verified. There was no significant difference between maximal and submaximal OUES, showing strong correlations with each other and oxygen consumption (peak and VAT). These results indicate that OUES can be a useful parameter which could be used as a cardiopulmonary fitness index in subjects with severe limitations to perform CPX, as for morbidly obese women."
https://openalex.org/W2605317106,"Background Mechanical stress, including blood pressure related factors, up-regulate expression of the pro-angiogenic extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C in skeletal muscle. We hypothesized that increased capillarization of skeletal muscle with the repeated augmentation in perfusion during endurance training is associated with blood vessel-related expression of tenascin-C and would be affected by the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2104772, which characterizes the non-synonymous exchange of thymidine (T)-to-adenosine (A) in the amino acid codon 1677 of tenascin-C. Methods Sixty-one healthy, untrained, male white participants of Swiss descent performed thirty 30-min bouts of endurance exercise on consecutive weekdays using a cycling ergometer. Genotype and training interactions were called significant at Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 5% (repeated measures ANOVA). Results Endurance training increased capillary-to-fiber-ratio (+11%), capillary density (+7%), and mitochondrial volume density (+30%) in m. vastus lateralis. Tenascin-C protein expression in this muscle was confined to arterioles and venules (80% of cases) and increased after training in A-allele carriers. Prior to training, volume densities of subsarcolemmal and myofibrillar mitochondria in m. vastus lateralis muscle were 49% and 18%, respectively, higher in A/A homozygotes relative to T-nucleotide carriers (A/T and T/T). Training specifically increased capillary-to-fiber ratio in A-nucleotide carriers but not in T/T homozygotes. Genotype specific regulation of angiogenesis was reflected by the expression response of 8 angiogenesis-associated transcripts after exercise, and confirmed by training-induced alterations of the shear stress related factors, vimentin and VEGF A. Conclusion Our findings provide evidence for a negative influence of T/T homozygosity in rs2104772 on capillary remodeling with endurance exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2605110748,"Mediterranean forests are fragile ecosystems vulnerable to recent global warming and reduction of precipitation, and a long-term negative effect is expected on vegetation with increasing drought and in areas burnt by fires. We investigated the spatial distribution of genetic variation of Arbutus unedo in the western Iberia Peninsula, using plastid markers with conservation and provenance regions design purposes. This species is currently undergoing an intense domestication process in the region, and, like other species, is increasingly under the threat from climate change, habitat fragmentation and wildfires. We sampled 451 trees from 15 natural populations from different ecological conditions spanning the whole species’ distribution range in the region. We applied Bayesian analysis and identified four clusters (north, centre, south, and a single-population cluster). Hierarchical AMOVA showed higher differentiation among clusters than among populations within clusters. The relatively low within-clusters differentiation can be explained by a common postglacial history of nearby populations. The genetic structure found, supported by the few available palaeobotanical records, cannot exclude the hypothesis of two independent A. unedo refugia in western Iberia Peninsula during the Last Glacial Maximum. Based on the results we recommend a conservation strategy by selecting populations for conservation based on their allelic richness and diversity and careful seed transfer consistent with current species’ genetic structure."
https://openalex.org/W2605119896,"In general, obesity is a major contributor to metabolic syndrome (MetS) and is associated with insulin resistance (IR). Metabolically obese but normal weight (MONW) individuals present metabolic abnormalities and features of MetS despite having a normal range of body mass index (BMI). In recent years, different subtypes of obesity have been introduced, including metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically obese obese (MOO). Also, it has been reported that vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) are possibly linked with MetS.In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between serum 25(OH)D, serum PTH, and the risk of metabolic obesity in four subtypes using nationally representative survey data for a Korean population conducted between 2008 and 2010. Of the 29,235 Korean participants, 18,997 subjects aged under 50 years were excluded. Participants with diabetes (n = 1,520), renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 45 ml/min/1.73 m2, chronic kidney disease [CKD] stage 3b, 4, and 5 according to KDOQI classification [1]) (n = 49), history of treatment for osteoporosis (n = 455), insufficient data (n = 1,613), and fasting time less than 8 hours prior to blood collection (n = 771) were excluded for analysis. Ultimately, 5,830 adults (2,582 men and 3,248 women) were eligible for the present study. And, subtypes of obesity were divided into four types: Metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), Metabolically healthy obese (MHO), Metabolically obese but normal weight (MONW), and Metabolically obese obese (MOO). Female subjects with metabolic obesity were more likely to have higher levels of PTH and Male subjects with metabolic health were more likely to have higher serum 25(OH)D levels.We concluded that a positive association between serum PTH concentration and metabolic obesity among female subjects and an inverse relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and the risk of metabolic obesity were found among male subjects. Further prospective studies are necessary to explore the biological mechanisms underlying these sex-specific findings."
https://openalex.org/W2604595042,"The Malpighian tubules are the insect excretory organs, responsible for ion and water homeostasis and elimination of nitrogenous wastes. Post-genomic assays suggest they also metabolize and detoxify xenobiotic compounds and have antimicrobial properties. The Phasmatodea have an additional, unique set of excretory organs referred to predominantly as midgut appendices. Their function and how it compares to phasmid and other insect Malpighian tubules is unknown. Hypotheses include carbonic anhydrase activity, calcium and metal cation sequestration, and xenobiotic transport. This work presents the first comparative transcriptomic analysis of the Phasmatodean excretory organs, using the model insect Carausius morosus. I produced de novo transcriptomes of the midgut appendices, midgut wall, and Malpighian tubules, and looked for differentially expressed genes associated with putative organ functions. The appendices differentially and highly express lipid transport and metabolism proteins, and the biomineralization gene otopetrin. The Malpighian tubules differentially and highly express acid phosphatases and multiple transporter types, while appendices express fat-soluble vitamin and peptide transporters. Many defense proteins such as multidrug resistance proteins, ABC transporters, cytochrome P450’s, and glutathione-S-transferases were differentially expressed in specific excretory organs. I hypothesize that the appendices and Malpighian tubules both have defensive / xenobiotic metabolism functions, but each likely target different substrates. Phasmid Malpighian tubules excrete as in other insects, while the appendices may predominantly regulate amino acids, fats, and fat-soluble compounds. Lipid metabolism in insects is poorly understood, and the Phasmatodea may thus serve as a model for studying this further."
https://openalex.org/W2604350919,"In the present research, we investigate the communicative strategies of 20 month old human infants and great apes when requesting rewards from a human experimenter. Infants and apes both adapted their signals to the attentional state of the experimenter as well as to the location of the reward. Yet, while infants frequently positioned themselves in front of the experimenter and pointed towards a distant reward, apes either remained in the experimenter’s line of sight and pointed towards him or moved out of sight and pointed towards the reward. Further, when pointing towards a reward that was placed at a distance from the experimenter, only the infants, and not the apes, took the experimenter’s attentional state into account. These results demonstrate that prelinguistic human infants and nonhuman apes use different means when guiding others’ attention to a location; indicating that differing cognitive mechanisms may underlie their pointing gestures."
https://openalex.org/W2604464132,"Background and aim The Montreal classification of disease behaviour in Crohn's disease describes progression of disease towards a stricturing and penetrating phenotype. In the present paper, we propose an alternative representation of the long-term course of Crohn’s disease complications, the rolling phenotype. As is commonly observed in clinical practice, this definition allows progression to a more severe phenotype (stricturing, penetrating) but also, regression to a less severe behaviour (inflammatory, or remission) over time. Methods All patients diagnosed with Crohn's Disease between 01/01/1994 and 01/03/2008, managed at a single centre and observed for a minimum of 5 years, had development and resolution of all complications recorded. A rolling phenotype was defined at each time point based on all observed complications in the three years prior to the time point. Phenotype was defined as B1, B2, B3, or B23 (penetrating and stenotic). The progression over time of the rolling phenotype was compared to that of the cumulative Montreal phenotype. Results 305 patients were observed a median of 10.0 (Intraquartile range 7.3–13.7) years. Longitudinal progression of rolling phenotype demonstrated a consistent proportion of patients with B1 (70%), B2 (20%), B3 (5%) and B23 (5%) phenotypes. These proportions were observed regardless of initial phenotype. In contrast, the cumulative Montreal phenotype progressed towards a more severe phenotype with time (B1 (39%), B2 (26%), B3(35%) at 10 years). Conclusion A rolling phenotype provides an alternative view of the longitudinal burden of intra-abdominal complications in Crohn's disease. From this viewpoint, 70% of patients have durable freedom from complication over time (>3 years)."
https://openalex.org/W2604465019,"Long-chain cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are common components of the epicuticle of terrestrial arthropods. CHC serve as a protective barrier against environmental influences but also act as semiochemicals in animal communication. Regarding the latter aspect, species- or intra-functional group specific CHCs composition and variation are relatively well studied. However, comparative knowledge about the relationship of CHC quantity and their relation to surface area—volume ratios in the context of water loss and protection is fragmentary. Hence, we aim to study the taxon-specific relationship of the CHC amount and surface-area to volume ratio related to their functional role (e.g. in water loss). We focused on flower visiting insects and analyzed the CHC amounts of three insect orders (Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera) using gas chromatography—mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We included 113 species from two grassland plots, quantified their CHCs, and measured their body mass and surface area. We found differences in the surface area, CHCs per body mass and the CHC density (= amount of CHCs per surface area) across the three insect taxa. Especially the Hymenoptera had a higher CHC density compared to Diptera and Lepidoptera. CHC density could be explained by surface area-volume ratios in Hymenoptera but not in Diptera and Lepidoptera. Unexpectedly, CHC density decreased with increasing surface area—volume ratios."
https://openalex.org/W2604728625,"In this nationwide matched cohort study, we have investigated whether being born with hypospadias affect subsequent psychosocial outcomes in adulthood. We analyzed prospectively collected data from national Swedish registers. Data on the diagnoses were collected from the National Patient Register and the Medical Birth Register. Data on psychosocial outcomes such as educational and income level, marital status and disability pension were collected from Statistics Sweden. The effects of covariates, such as age, county of birth, presence of other malformations and psychiatric illness, were taken into account. The associations between hypospadias and psychosocial outcomes were calculated using conditional logistic regression and expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 4378 men diagnosed with hypospadias, born between 1969 and 1993 in Sweden. Patients with hypospadias were matched with unaffected men by year of birth and birth county. We did not detect any differences in educational or income level. The probability of entering marriage (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90–1.14) did not differ, regardless of phenotype. We did, however, detect a 40% increased probability of receiving a disability pension, (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.20–1.61). In conclusion, men born with hypospadias in Sweden do not differ from unaffected men with respect to the majority of psychosocial outcomes studied. They are, however, at increased risk of receiving a disability pension, which motivates further investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2604538051,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection in cats results in life-long viral persistence and progressive immunopathology. We have previously described a cohort of experimentally infected cats demonstrating a progressive decline of peripheral blood CD4+ T-cell over six years in the face of apparent peripheral viral latency. More recently we reported findings from this same cohort that revealed popliteal lymph node tissue as sites for ongoing viral replication suggesting that tissue reservoirs are important in FIV immunopathogenesis during the late asymptomatic phase of infection. Results reported herein characterize important tissue reservoirs of active viral replication during the late asymptomatic phase by examining biopsied specimens of spleen, mesenteric lymph node (MLN), and intestine from FIV-infected and uninfected control cats. Peripheral blood collected coincident with harvest of tissues demonstrated severe CD4+ T-cell depletion, undetectable plasma viral gag RNA and rarely detectable peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-associated viral RNA (vRNA) by real-time PCR. However, vRNA was detectable in all three tissue sites from three of four FIV-infected cats despite the absence of detectable vRNA in plasma. A novel in situ hybridization assay identified B cell lymphoid follicular domains as microanatomical foci of ongoing FIV replication. Additionally, we demonstrated that CD4+ leukocyte depletion in tissues, and CD4+ and CD21+ leukocytes as important cellular reservoirs of ongoing replication. These findings revealed that tissue reservoirs support foci of ongoing viral replication, in spite of highly restricted viral replication in blood. Lentiviral eradication strategies will need address tissue viral reservoirs."
https://openalex.org/W2604189949,"The hatching of a blastocyst where the blastocyst portions on the inside and the outside of the zona pellucida feature a figure-of-eight shape is termed ""8""-shaped hatching; this type of hatching has been reported to affect the proper presentation of the inner cell mass (ICM) in both human and mouse embryos. Here, our aim was to investigate the factors that affect ICM presentation during ""8""-shaped hatching. We performed IVF by using B6D2F1 female mice and ICR male mice, and used the 104 captured blastocysts. Embryos were maintained in KSOM at 37°C in a 5% CO2, 5% O2, and 90% N2 environment, and their growth behavior was monitored individually and continuously using time-lapse cinematography. At 120 h after insemination, embryos were immunostained and examined under a confocal microscope. We used the hatching form to identify ""8""-shaped hatching, and we classified the ""8""-shaped-hatching blastocysts into two groups, one in which the hatching site was near the ICM center, and the other in which the hatching site was far from the ICM center. We measured each group for ICM size and the number of Oct3/4-positive cells. Of the 95 hatching or hatched embryos, 74 were ""8""-shaped-hatching blastocysts, and in these embryos, the ICM was significantly wider when the hatching site was near the ICM than when the hatching site was far from the ICM (P = 0.0091). Moreover, in the ""8""-shaped-hatching blastocysts in which the ICM was included in the blastocyst portion outside the zona pellucida-the portion defined as the ""outside blastocyst""-after the collapse of this outside blastocyst, the ICM adhered to the trophectoderm of the outside blastocyst, opposite the hatching site. Our results indicate that in ""8""-shaped-hatching blastocysts, the hatching site and the collapse of outside blastocyst affect ICM formation. Thus, the assessment of ""8""-shaped hatching behaviors could yield indices for accurately evaluating embryo quality."
https://openalex.org/W2604938361,"Although the plant and animal kingdoms were separated more than 1,6 billion years ago, multicellular development is for both guided by similar transcriptional, epigenetic and posttranscriptional machinery. One may ask to what extent there are similarities and differences in the gene regulation circuits and their dynamics when it comes to important processes like stem cell regulation. The key players in mouse embryonic stem cells governing pluripotency versus differentiation are Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. Correspondingly, the WUSCHEL and CLAVATA3 genes represent a core in the Shoot Apical Meristem regulation for plants. In addition, both systems have designated genes that turn on differentiation. There is very little molecular homology between mammals and plants for these core regulators. Here, we focus on functional homologies by performing a comparison between the circuitry connecting these players in plants and animals and find striking similarities, suggesting that comparable regulatory logics have been evolved for stem cell regulation in both kingdoms. From in silico simulations we find similar differentiation dynamics. Further when in the differentiated state, the cells are capable of regaining the stem cell state. We find that the propensity for this is higher for plants as compared to mammalians. Our investigation suggests that, despite similarity in core regulatory networks, the dynamics of these can contribute to plant cells being more plastic than mammalian cells, i.e. capable to reorganize from single differentiated cells to whole plants-reprogramming. The presence of an incoherent feed-forward loop in the mammalian core circuitry could be the origin of the different reprogramming behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2605056393,"Information exchange is a crucial process in groups, but to date, no one has systematically examined how a group member's relationship with a group can undermine this process. The current research examined whether disidentified group members (i.e., members who have a negative relationship with their group) strategically undermine the group outcome in information exchange. Disidentification has been found to predict negative group-directed behaviour, but at the same time disidentified members run the risk of being punished or excluded from the group when displaying destructive behaviour. In three studies we expected and found that disidentified group members subtly act against the interest of the group by withholding important private information, while at the same time they keep up appearances by sharing important information that is already known by the other group members. These findings stress the importance of taking a group member's relationship with a group into account when considering the process of information exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2604984585,"Rapid growth in scientific output requires methods for quantitative synthesis of prior research, yet current meta-analysis methods limit aggregation to studies with similar designs. Here we describe and validate Generalized Model Aggregation (GMA), which allows researchers to combine prior estimated models of a phenomenon into a quantitative meta-model, while imposing few restrictions on the structure of prior models or on the meta-model. In an empirical validation, building on 27 published equations from 16 studies, GMA provides a predictive equation for Basal Metabolic Rate that outperforms existing models, identifies novel nonlinearities, and estimates biases in various measurement methods. Additional numerical examples demonstrate the ability of GMA to obtain unbiased estimates from potentially mis-specified prior studies. Thus, in various domains, GMA can leverage previous findings to compare alternative theories, advance new models, and assess the reliability of prior studies, extending meta-analysis toolbox to many new problems."
https://openalex.org/W2604198023,"Introduction Many studies have shown that people born in the spring are at a higher risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). This may be associated with lower levels of sun exposure, and consequently, lower levels of vitamin D3 during pregnancy. However, these relationships have not been verified thus far in any countries in Central Europe. Objective The aim of our study was to determine the frequency distribution of births for each calendar month in patients suffering from MS in Poland. Methods We analyzed data for 2574 patients diagnosed with MS (1758 women, 816 men) living in Poland for an extended period. We added corrections resulting from the frequency distribution of births for the years in which the patients were born. We applied the Hewitt test for seasonality with Rogerson modification for 3-, 4-, or 6-month pulses or periods. Moreover, we examined the average number hours of sunshine in every month of the year. Results The rank-sums for successive 3- and 4-month segments indicated the period from September to December and from October to December as having a significantly lower incidence (p = 0.027 and p = 0.054, respectively). We did not find a correlation between with hours of sunshine in the first trimester of pregnancy, the child’s birth month, and the child developing MS. Conclusions We were able to confirm a seasonal variation in the risk of MS in Poland. However, these findings did not correlate with hours of sunshine during the first trimester of pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2605190060,"Purpose The correlation of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is unclear. We therefore conducted a cohort study to investigate whether FMS is correlated with an increased risk of PUD. Methods In this study, we established an FMS cohort comprising 26068 patients aged more than 20 years who were diagnosed with FMS from 2000 to 2011. Furthermore, we established a control cohort by randomly choosing 104269 people without FMS who were matched to the FMS patients by gender, age, and index year. All patients were free of PUD at the baseline. Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed to compute the hazard ratio of PUD after adjustment for demographic characteristics and comorbidities. Results The prevalence of comorbidities was significantly higher in the FMS patients than in the controls. The incidence of PUD was 29.8 and 19.4 per 1000 person-years in the FMS and control cohorts, respectively. In addition, the FMS cohort exhibited a 1.40-fold higher risk of PUD (95% confidence interval = 1.35–1.45) compared with the control cohort. After control for confounding factors, the medications (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and antidepressants) taken by the FMS patients did not increase the risk of PUD. Conclusion FMS patients exhibit a higher risk of PUD than that of patients without FMS."
https://openalex.org/W2604479222,"Previously, we identified that both fingers 1 and 2 in the three Cys2His2 zinc-finger domains (TZD) of testis zinc-finger protein specifically bind to its cognate DNA; however, finger 3 is non-sequence-specific. To gain insights into the interaction mechanism, here we further investigated the DNA-binding characteristics of TZD bound to non-specific DNAs and its finger segments bound to cognate DNA. TZD in non-specific DNA binding showed smaller chemical shift perturbations, as expected. However, the direction of shift perturbation, change of DNA imino-proton NMR signal, and dynamics on the 15N backbone atom significantly differed between specific and non-specific binding. Using these unique characteristics, we confirmed that the three single-finger segments (TZD1, TZD2 and TZD3) and the two-finger segment (TZD23) non-specifically bind to the cognate DNA. In comparison, the other two-finger segment (TZD12) binding to the cognate DNA features simultaneous non-specific and semi-specific binding, both slowly exchanged in terms of NMR timescale. The process of TZD binding to the cognate DNA is likely stepwise: initially TZD non-specifically binds to DNA, then fingers 1 and 2 insert cooperatively into the major groove of DNA by semi-specific binding, and finally finger 3 non-specifically binds to DNA, which promotes the specific binding on fingers 1 and 2 and stabilizes the formation of a specific TZD-DNA complex."
