Here, we demonstrate that mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses can manipulate host skin microbiota to produce a scent that attracts mosquitoes. We observed that Aedes mosquitoes preferred to seek and feed on mice infected by dengue and Zika viruses. Acetophenone, a volatile compound that is predominantly produced by the skin microbiota, was enriched in the volatiles from the infected hosts to potently stimulate mosquito olfaction for attractiveness. Of note, acetophenone emission was higher in dengue patients than in healthy people. Mechanistically, flaviviruses infection suppressed the expression of RELMα, an essential antimicrobial protein on host skin, thereby leading to the expansion of acetophenone-producing commensal bacteria and, consequently, a high acetophenone level. Given that RELMα can be specifically induced by a vitamin A derivative, the dietary administration of isotretinoin to flavivirus-infected animals interrupted flavivirus life cycle by reducing mosquito host-seeking activity, thus providing a strategy of arboviral control.

Arboviruses naturally survive between vertebrate hosts and arthropod vectors. The hematophagous behavior-mediated viral life cycle is a complex and dynamic biological process involving a multidimensional interplay among viruses, vectors, and hosts (Yu et al., 2019Yu X. Zhu Y. Xiao X. Wang P. Cheng G. Progress towards understanding the mosquito-borne virus life cycle.Trends Parasitol. 2019; 35: 1009-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Basically, hematophagous arthropods need to actively locate a host and incidentally feed on a viremic host to acquire infectious viral particles circulating in the host blood. The viruses subsequently establish an infection in the vectors, thereby enabling them to become competent to transmit viruses to naive hosts through blood feeding (Franz et al., 2015Franz A.W.

Zhang B. Zhao T. Wang P. Liang G. Cheng G. Blood meal acquisition enhances arbovirus replication in mosquitoes through activation of the GABAergic system.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Of note, an essential vector behavior for viral acquisition is that hematophagous arthropods orient to viremic hosts with a high frequency. Therefore, pathogen-infected host individuals may be more attractive to relevant vectors due to altered host cues following infection (De Moraes et al., 2014De Moraes C.M. Stanczyk N.M. Betz H.S. Pulido H. Sim D.G. Read A.F. Mescher M.C. Malaria-induced changes in host odors enhance mosquito attraction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 11079-11084Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and this is particularly true in the transmission of human parasites (Robinson et al., 2018Robinson A. Busula A.O. Voets M.A. Beshir K.B. Caulfield J.C. Powers S.J. Verhulst N.O. Winskill P. Muwanguzi J. Birkett M.A. et al.Plasmodium-associated changes in human odor attract mosquitoes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115: E4209-E4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is well documented that malaria-induced changes in host odors manipulate mosquito attraction (Busula et al., 2017Busula A.O. Bousema T. Mweresa C.K. Masiga D. Logan J.G. Sauerwein R.W. Verhulst N.O. Takken W. de Boer J.G.

Nonetheless, it is still largely unknown whether arboviruses might exploit a similar strategy to shape host-vector interactions, thereby enhancing the probability of viral dissemination in nature. Volatiles are one of the key host cues to manipulate the feeding motivation of hematophagous vectors (Takken and Knols, 1999Takken W. Knols B.G. Odor-mediated behavior of Afrotropical malaria mosquitoes.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1999; 44: 131-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that both infection and inflammatory responses can reshape the spectrum of host odorants, thereby enabling the influence of vector behavior (Emami et al., 2017Emami S.N. Lindberg B.G. Hua S. Hill S.R. Mozuraitis R. Lehmann P. Birgersson G. Borg-Karlson A.K. Ignell R. Faye I.

Mikania micrantha wilt virus alters insect vector's host preference to enhance its own spread.Viruses. 2019; 11: 336Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For example, an isoprenoid precursor produced by Plasmodium affects mosquitoes’ blood meal-seeking and feeding behaviors by increasing the release of volatile blends by human red blood cells (Emami et al., 2017Emami S.N. Lindberg B.G. Hua S. Hill S.R. Mozuraitis R. Lehmann P. Birgersson G. Borg-Karlson A.K. Ignell R. Faye I. A key malaria metabolite modulates vector blood seeking, feeding, and susceptibility to infection.Science. 2017; 355: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Malaria-infected mice were significantly more attractive to mosquito vectors, accompanied by increased emission of skin volatiles (De Moraes et al., 2014De Moraes C.M. Stanczyk N.M. Betz H.S. Pulido H. Sim D.G. Read A.F. Mescher M.C. Malaria-induced changes in host odors enhance mosquito attraction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 11079-11084Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that acetophenone released from the skin microbiota of flavivirus-infected hosts facilitates mosquito attractiveness, thus enhancing flavivirus transmission by mosquitoes. Flaviviruses can promote the proliferation of acetophenone-producing skin commensal bacteria by suppressing the expression of the essential antimicrobial protein RELMα. These results demonstrate that flaviviruses can manipulate host skin microbiota to produce a mosquito attractant and facilitate transmission and provide an alternative strategy of arboviral control. For the transmission of vector-borne pathogens, host cues may play an essential role in determining the seeking and feeding motivation of hematophagous arthropods (De Moraes et al., 2014De Moraes C.M. Stanczyk N.M. Betz H.S. Pulido H. Sim D.G. Read A.F. Mescher M.C. Malaria-induced changes in host odors enhance mosquito attraction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 11079-11084Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether Aedes aegypti mosquitoes may present different behavioral responses to host cues from mice infected by flaviviruses. A three-cage olfactometer assay was exploited to test mosquito responses to these airstreams in which the air passes through two-side independent chambers containing either Zika virus (ZIKV)-infected or uninfected mice at a constant rate (Figure 1A). Sixty female A. aegypti mosquitoes (Rockefeller strain) were released into the central cage, where they freely chose to enter the trapping chamber on either side. Three type I and II interferon-receptor-deficient (ifnagr−/−) C57BL/6 (AG6) mice, which have been exploited as an animal model of ZIKV infection (Zhu et al., 2019Zhu Y. Tong L. Nie K. Wiwatanaratanabutr I. Sun P. Li Q. Yu X. Wu P. Wu T. Yu C. et al.Host serum iron modulates dengue virus acquisition by mosquitoes.Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4: 2405-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), were placed into each chamber to assess downwind mosquito responses. The remaining individuals in each trapping chamber were counted to present the choice preference of mosquitoes (Figure 1A). Given that the ZIKV-infected AG6 mice presented high viremia from 2–6 days and died at 8–10 days post-infection (Figure S1A), the behavioral test was performed over the course of infection until 6 days. At days 0 and 2 after infection, the ratios of mosquitoes entering both trapping chambers were similar (∼50%). By days 4 and 6 after infection, the number of mosquitoes in the trapping chamber next to the ZIKV-infected mice was greater than that in the trapping chamber close to uninfected mice (∼70% versus 30%) (Figure 1B). These results suggest that mosquitoes preferred ZIKV-infected over uninfected mice. We noted a similar preference of mosquitoes seeking dengue virus 2 (DENV2)-infected over uninfected animals (Figures 1C and S1B). We next exploited a two-port olfactometer assay to further assess flavivirus infection-mediated attraction to Aedes mosquitoes. This olfactometer entails passing filtered air at a constant rate through two glass chambers containing odor sources (infected or uninfected AG6 mice) and testing downwind mosquito responses to these airstreams (Figure 1D). Sixty female A. aegypti mosquitoes were used for each trial, where we found a positive mosquito response to either infected or uninfected mice flying to the upwind end of the tunnel, and they entered a trapping chamber randomly assigned to that source and probed the mesh screen that prevented further upwind movement (Figure 1D). Consistent with the results from a three-cage olfactometer assay, more mosquitoes entered the chamber of ZIKV- (Figure 1E) and DENV2- (Figure 1F) infected animals at 4 and 6 days post-infection than those flowing to the chamber of uninfected animals.Figure S1Viremia and physiological characterization in infected animals, and behavioral preference of field-derived mosquitoes to infected mice, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A and B) Measurement of viremia in the sera from infected animals.

Several host cues are known to influence mosquito behaviors, such as heat (Corfas and Vosshall, 2015Corfas R.A. Vosshall L.B. The cation channel TRPA1 tunes mosquito thermotaxis to host temperatures.eLife. 2015; 4: e11750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), carbon dioxide (CO2) (Gillies, 1980Gillies M.T. The role of carbon dioxide in host-finding by mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae): a review.Bull. Entomol. Res. 1980; 70: 525-532Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and odor emission (Cardé, 2015Cardé R.T. Multi-cue integration: how female mosquitoes locate a human host.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: R793-R795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A previous study suggested that CO2 is a potent activator of mosquito host-seeking (Gillies, 1980Gillies M.T. The role of carbon dioxide in host-finding by mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae): a review.Bull. Entomol. Res. 1980; 70: 525-532Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the CO2 emission was significantly reduced from 5 days after ZIKV infection, which may be attributed to the deteriorating physiological status before animal death (Figure S1C). CO2 emissions by DENV2-infected mice were not altered compared with uninfected mice (Figure S1D). These results suggest that CO2 emission is not the host cue accounting for the increased attractiveness of the infected animals to A. aegypti in this olfactometer system. In addition to CO2 emission, body temperature increased after infection by both ZIKV (Figure S1E) and DENV2 (Figure S1F). We next assessed the role of body temperature in animal attractiveness to mosquitoes. Intraperitoneal inoculation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced the mouse body temperature from 5 to 8 h post-treatment (Figure S1G). In the same experimental settings in Figure 1A, the number of mosquitoes drawn to the mice with a high body temperature at 6 h post-LPS inoculation was the same as that to the control mice (Figure S1H), thereby excluding body temperature as an essential host cue for the mosquitoes’ host-seeking behavior in these experimental settings. We next assessed the role of odor emission from animals in mosquito host-seeking behavior by employing a deodorization device that absorbs volatiles in the airflow passing through two-sided independent chambers containing either infected or uninfected mice (Figure 1G). In this setting, the ratios of mosquitoes seeking infected and uninfected animals were comparable (Figures 1H and 1I), indicating that an odorant(s) from the infected animals determined the mosquitoes’ behavioral preference. The aforementioned studies were performed with the long-term lab-adapted A. aegypti Rockefeller strain. We next exploited two field A. aegypti strains from Paraiba in Brazil (Brazil Paraiba strain) and Yunnan Province in China (China Yunan Strain) in our investigation. With the three-cage olfactometer assay described in Figure 1A, both strains preferred ZIKV- and DENV2-infected mice at 4 and 6 days after infection to uninfected mice (Figures S1I and S1J). In addition to A. aegypti, Aedes albopictus is another native mosquito vector for DENV and ZIKV transmission. Consistently, a field A. albopictus strain collected from Jiangsu province in China (China Jiangsu strain) presented a similar preferential behavior to the flavivirus-infected mice (Figure S1K). Taken together, we conclude that Aedes mosquitoes’ host-seeking behavior can be motivated by volatile cues from flavivirus-infected animals. We next characterized the volatile emissions of DENV2- and ZIKV-infected mice over a time course. Whole-body volatiles from infected and healthy mice were collected in glass chambers connected to a volatile collection system that pushed clean air over the mice to go through adsorbent filters for 8 h (Figure S2A). Three parallel samples from a time point were then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay (GC-MS) at 4 and 6 days post-infection. Four hundred twenty-two compounds were identified (Figure 2A; Table S1). The volatile compounds that were >1.5-fold regulated in infected mice than in uninfected mice at both 4 and 6 days after infection were analyzed in depth. Indeed, 11 volatiles were upregulated, and 19 were downregulated in the DENV2-infected animals compared with in healthy controls. Thirteen and 9 compounds were up- and downregulated by ZIKV infection, respectively. Twenty compounds (11 upregulated and 9 downregulated) were common to both DENV2- and ZIKV-infected mice (Figure S2B). We therefore assessed whether these common volatile compounds may stimulate the mosquitoes’ olfactory response by an electroantennogram assay. Three compounds, acetophenone, decanal, and styrene, elicited a significant electrophysiological response (>100 μV) of the A. aegypti antenna (Figure 2B) in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2C), in which the highest response was activated by acetophenone. Subsequently, we assessed the effects of 20 regulated volatile compounds on the host-seeking activity of the A. aegypti mosquitoes using the three-cage olfactometer assay in Figure 1A. Only acetophenone, but not other compounds, attracted more mosquitoes than the mock treatment (∼70% versus 30%) (Figure S2C). Subsequently, we used a two-port olfactometer assay described in Figure 1D to validate this effect of acetophenone. Consistent with the above-mentioned results, 1 μg or more acetophenone to the animal skin had a significant effect on mosquitoes’ host-seeking behavior; however, 0.1 μg of acetophenone did not (Figure 2D). Notably, acetophenone, when applied to human hands, also demonstrated a more potent mosquito-attracting effect (Figure 2E). Taken together, these results indicate that acetophenone is a host odorant upregulated by flavivirus infection and a potent attractant for mosquitoes.Figure 2Acetophenone from flavivirus-infected mice is a host volatile that mediates mosquito attractionShow full caption(A) The whole-body volatile blends were presented by heatmap visualization.

We next investigated the biological relevance of acetophenone emitted by animals to mosquito attraction. First, we quantified the exact amount of acetophenone released from infected or uninfected mice by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) assay (Figure 2F). The odorant blends samples were collected from AG6 mice at 4 days after DENV2 or ZIKV infection in a glass chamber through SPME fibers for 30 min. The uninfected mice were served as mock controls. Based on the standard curve (Figure S2D), the absolute abundance of acetophenone released by either DENV2 or ZIKV was measured by SPME. The amounts of acetophenone produced by virus-infected mice were ∼10-fold higher than those produced by uninfected animals (Figure 2F) (DENV: 92 versus 9 ng per 30 min; ZIKV: 104 versus 9 ng per 30 min). We next assessed the amount of acetophenone volatilized from the mice spread with 0.1, 1, and 10 μg of acetophenone on their skin. Of note, 89–150 and 733–1,160 ng of airborne acetophenone were recovered from the mice treated with 1 and 10 μg of acetophenone on the skin, respectively (Figures S2E and 2F). These data demonstrate that mice spread with 1 μg of acetophenone on their skin and flavivirus-infected animals produced comparable airborne concentrations of acetophenone. To further assess the role of human odorants in mosquito attractiveness, we recruited dengue fever patients and healthy volunteers (Table S2) and collected odorant blends from their armpits by stir bars coating with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Soini et al., 2006Soini H.A.

The volatile extracts were applied on filter paper, which was subsequently attached onto the palm of a volunteer hand for a mosquito behavioral assay with a two-port olfactometer (Figure 2G).

The high resistance of biofilms to antimicrobial agents makes their removal as a big challenge. In this study, spray-drying was used to develop microcapsules containing carvacrol, a natural antimicrobial agent, to enhance its activity against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis biofilms. The physicochemical properties and microscopic morphology of the realized capsules and cells were characterized. The minimum inhibitory concentration of encapsulated carvacrol (E-CARV) (1.25 mg mL-1) was 4-times lower than that of free carvacrol (F-CARV) (5 mg mL-1) against P. aeruginosa, while it remained the same against E. faecalis (0.625 mg mL-1). E-CARV was able to reduce biofilm below the detection limit for P. aeruginosa and by 5.5 log CFU ml-1 for E. faecalis after 15 min of treatment. Results also showed that F-CARV and E-CARV destabilize the bacterial cell membrane leading to cell death. These results indicate that carvacrol exhibited a strong antimicrobial effect against both bacterial biofilms. In addition, spray-drying could be used as an effective tool to enhance the antibiofilm activity of carvacrol, while reducing the concentrations required for disinfection of abiotic surfaces."

It is therefore tempting to apply analysis techniques that attempt to reduce noise and enhance signals of interest. In this paper, we draw attention to the possibility that denoising methods may introduce bias and lead to incorrect scientific inferences. To present our case, we first review the basic statistical concepts of bias and variance. Denoising techniques typically reduce variance observed across repeated measurements, but this can come at the expense of introducing bias to the average expected outcome. We then conduct three simple simulations that provide concrete examples of how bias may manifest in everyday situations. These simulations reveal several findings that may be surprising and counterintuitive: (i) different methods can be equally effective at reducing variance but some incur bias while others do not, (ii) identifying methods that better recover ground truth does not guarantee the absence of bias, (iii) bias can arise even if one has specific knowledge of properties of the signal of interest. We suggest that researchers should consider and possibly quantify bias before deploying denoising methods on important research data."

https://openalex.org/W4283721932,"Human protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is an essential redox-regulated enzyme required for oxidative protein folding. It comprises four thioredoxin domains, two catalytically active (a, a') and two inactive (b, b'), organized to form a flexible abb'a' U-shape. Snapshots of unbound oxidized and reduced PDI have been obtained by X-ray crystallography. Yet, how PDI's structure changes in response to the redox environment and inhibitor binding remains controversial. Here, we used multiparameter confocal single-molecule FRET to track the movements of the two catalytic domains with high temporal resolution. We found that at equilibrium, PDI visits three structurally distinct conformational ensembles, two ""open"" (O1 and O2) and one ""closed"" (C). We show that the redox environment dictates the time spent in each ensemble and the rate at which they exchange. While oxidized PDI samples O1, O2, and C more evenly and in a slower fashion, reduced PDI predominantly populates O1 and O2 and exchanges between them more rapidly, on the submillisecond timescale. These findings were not expected based on crystallographic data. Using mutational analyses, we further demonstrate that the R300-W396 cation-π interaction and active site cysteines dictate, in unexpected ways, how the catalytic domains relocate. Finally, we show that irreversible inhibitors targeting the active sites of reduced PDI did not abolish these protein dynamics but rather shifted the equilibrium toward the closed ensemble. This work introduces a new structural framework that challenges current views of PDI dynamics, helps rationalize its multifaceted role in biology, and should be considered when designing PDI-targeted therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4283762010,"Recent studies demonstrated that the Golgi reassembly stacking proteins (GRASPs), especially GRASP55, regulate Golgi-independent unconventional secretion of certain cytosolic and transmembrane cargoes; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we surveyed several neurodegenerative disease–related proteins, including mutant huntingtin (Htt-Q74), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), tau, and TAR DNA–binding protein 43 (TDP-43), for unconventional secretion; our results show that Htt-Q74 is most robustly secreted in a GRASP55-dependent manner. Using Htt-Q74 as a model system, we demonstrate that unconventional secretion of Htt is GRASP55 and autophagy dependent and is enhanced under stress conditions such as starvation and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Mechanistically, we show that GRASP55 facilitates Htt secretion by tethering autophagosomes to lysosomes to promote autophagosome maturation and subsequent lysosome secretion and by stabilizing p23/TMED10, a channel for translocation of cytoplasmic proteins into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment. Moreover, we found that GRASP55 levels are upregulated by various stresses to facilitate unconventional secretion, whereas inhibition of Htt-Q74 secretion by GRASP55 KO enhances Htt aggregation and toxicity. Finally, comprehensive secretomic analysis identified novel cytosolic cargoes secreted by the same unconventional pathway, including transgelin (TAGLN), multifunctional protein ADE2 (PAICS), and peroxiredoxin-1 (PRDX1). In conclusion, this study defines the pathway of GRASP55-mediated unconventional protein secretion and provides important insights into the progression of Huntington’s disease.

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by increased neuronal cell death and decreased cognitive abilities of patients. Different diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are caused by different protein-based aberrations that affect different pathways; yet all cause neuronal cell death by forming inclusion bodies (1Lee H.J.

How the secretion affects protein aggregation and toxicity in neurons, and whether secretion facilitates the spreading of toxic proteins to neighboring cells, remain elusive. In the conventional secretory pathway, transmembrane and secretory proteins, such as the amyloid precursor protein, are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to the Golgi, from where they are targeted to their final destinations. However, many neurotoxic proteins, such as Htt, SOD1, α-synuclein, tau, and TDP-43, are synthesized as cytosolic proteins. Secretion of these proteins is independent of the traditional secretory pathway in which the Golgi functions as a trafficking center. For example, mutant Htt exists in two forms, an intracellular form in patient neurons and an extracellular form in CSF (8Wild E.J. Boggio R. Langbehn D. Robertson N. Haider S.

Little is known about the machinery that controls unconventional secretion, and the interplay between Golgi-dependent conventional trafficking and Golgi-independent unconventional secretion has not been explored. Although the unconventional pathway is independent of the Golgi, unconventional secretion of numerous cytosolic proteins reported so far requires the Golgi reassembly stacking protein of 55 kDa, GRASP55 (GORASP2) (13Lee J.G.

They both form transoligomers to link the Golgi cisternae into the unique stacked architecture (18Xiang Y. Wang Y.

How GRASP55 regulates autophagosome-dependent unconventional secretion and whether GRASP55 is required for secretion of neurotoxic proteins such as Htt are unknown. In this study, we report that mutant Htt is unconventionally secreted in a GRASP55-dependent manner. Htt secretion is elevated under stress conditions, including energy deprivation and nutrient starvation, inhibition of proteasomal degradation, and induction of ER stress, all of which also upregulate GRASP55 expression. GRASP55 facilitates Htt secretion through two actions: one is to accelerate autophagic flux by facilitating autophagosome and lysosome fusion, the other is to stabilize p23/TMED10, a protein channel in the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) that translocates cytosolic proteins into the ERGIC lumen for unconventional secretion. Finally, we performed systematic proteomic and secretomic analysis of WT and GRASP55 KO (55KO) cells and identified a list of cytoplasmic proteins whose secretion depends on GRASP55. To determine if GRASP55 is required for the secretion of cytosolic proteins related to neurodegeneration, we expressed a number of neurotoxic proteins, including Htt exon 1 fragment with a long polyglutamine (Q74) stretch (GFP-Htt-Q74), WT SOD1 (GFP-SOD1), TDP-43 (TDP-43-GFP), and tau (FLAG-tau), in WT and 55KO HeLa cells we established earlier (19Bekier 2nd, M.E.

Cell. 2017; 28: 2833-2842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Htt, we chose the Htt exon 1 fragment because it has been shown that this fragment is harder to degrade, more toxic than full-length Htt, and detected in the CSF with an elevated concentration in HD (25Sathasivam K. Neueder A. Gipson T.A. Landles C. Benjamin A.C. Bondulich M.K. et al.Aberrant splicing of HTT generates the pathogenic exon 1 protein in Huntington disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

At 48 h post-transfection, we cultured the cells in a serum-free medium for 4 h and determined the level of the corresponding cargo in the conditioned media by Western blot. A conventional secretory pathway cargo, clusterin, was used as a control. All these proteins were found in the conditioned media (Fig. S1, A–D), but Htt-Q74 secretion was the most robust and GRASP55 dependent (Fig. S1A). Therefore, we used GFP-Htt-Q74 as a main marker to study the mechanism of GRASP55-dependent unconventional secretion. Since both GRASP55 and GRASP65 have been shown to be involved in unconventional secretion (29Kim J. Noh S.H. Piao H. Kim D.H. Kim K. Cha J.S. et al.Monomerization and ER relocalization of GRASP is a requisite for unconventional secretion of CFTR.Traffic. 2016; 17: 733-753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we expressed GFP-Htt-Q74 in WT, 55KO, 65KO, or double KO (both GRASP55 and GRASP65) HeLa cells. At 48 h post-transfection, about 90 to 95% cells contained soluble Htt in the cytosol, as indicated by the diffuse GFP signal. Another 5 to 10% of cells contained Htt aggregates that appeared as bright dots in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, these Htt aggregates were often found in the perinuclear region where the Golgi was localized. This prompted us to look at the effect of Htt expression on Golgi morphology. While soluble Htt did not seem to affect Golgi morphology, Htt aggregates induced Golgi defects as previously reported (30Sbodio J.I. Snyder S.H. Paul B.D. Golgi stress response reprograms cysteine metabolism to confer cytoprotection in Huntington's disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Brandstaetter H. Kruppa A.J. Buss F. Huntingtin is required for ER-to-Golgi transport and for secretory vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane.Dis. Model. Mech. 2014; 7: 1335-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the effect was more apparent in 55KO cells (Fig. 1A). For comparison, we also tested GFP-Htt-Q23 in parallel, which did not form aggregates or significantly affect the Golgi morphology (Fig. S1E). Similarly, expression of SOD1, TDP-43, or tau in WT cells had no significant impact on the Golgi structure (Fig. S1F). Next, we tested whether Htt secretion is GRASP dependent. After transfection of GFP-Htt-Q74 in WT, 55KO, 65KO, and double KO cells for 24 h, we cultured the cells in serum-free medium for 4 h and determined the level of Htt in the conditioned media by Western blot. Htt was readily detectable in the conditioned media, and the level was significantly reduced in 55KO but not 65KO cells (Fig. 1, B and C), indicating that Htt secretion depends on GRASP55 but not GRASP65. Secretion and processing of clusterin, a cargo molecule secreted by the conventional secretory pathway, were not affected by GRASP KO (Fig. 1B). In this assay, actin and two additional cytosolic proteins, hexokinase (HK1) and glucokinase (GCK), were not detected in the conditioned media (Figs. 1B and S1G). In addition, GFP-Htt-Q74 expression did not cause cell death as determined by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay (Fig. S1H). These results indicate that Htt was secreted rather than nonselectively released from dead cells. Taken together, GFP-Htt-Q74 expression causes Golgi defects especially in 55KO cells, whereas 55KO reduces GFP-Htt-Q74 secretion. To confirm that Htt is secreted through an unconventional Golgi-independent pathway, we blocked ER-to-Golgi trafficking by brefeldin A (BFA) treatment. As shown in Figure 1, D and E, BFA treatment diminished clusterin in the conditioned media, indicating a block of conventional secretion. Htt secretion was unaffected by BFA treatment, confirming that it is secreted via a Golgi-independent unconventional secretory pathway. The toxicity of Htt is associated with the length of the polyQ tract within the exon 1 fragment; Htt with more than ∼35 glutamines in the stretch is regarded as a disease mutant (6Bates G.P. Dorsey R. Gusella J.F. Hayden M.R. Kay C. Leavitt B.R. et al.Huntington disease.Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2015; 115005Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 7Saudou F. Humbert S. The Biology of huntingtin.Neuron. 2016; 89: 910-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). To determine whether the length of the polyQ tract affects Htt secretion, we coexpressed GFP-Htt-Q74 and GFP-Htt-Q23 in the same cells and compared their secretion. As shown in Figure 1, F and G, when GFP-Htt-Q74 and GFP-Htt-Q23 were coexpressed, the level of GFP-Htt-Q74 in the conditioned media was higher than that of GFP-Htt-Q23. This indicates that the selectivity for GFP-Htt-Q74 secretion relies on the polyQ tract. Indeed, when Q80-GFP (in the absence of Htt exon 1) was expressed in HeLa cells, it was secreted at a comparable rate as GFP-Htt-Q74 (∼10%), and Q80-GFP secretion was also robustly reduced in 55KO cells (Fig. S2, A and B). Interestingly, Htt exhibited two bands, and only the lower band was detected in the conditioned media; we were curious about the difference between the two bands. Htt is highly modified by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and cleavage (32Arbez N. Ratovitski T. Roby E. Chighladze E. Stewart J.C. Ren M. et al.Post-translational modifications clustering within proteolytic domains decrease mutant huntingtin toxicity.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 19238-19249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Among these, phosphorylation at S13 and S16 by TANK-binding kinase 1 or IκB kinase has been shown to reduce Htt aggregation and toxicity (33Thompson L.M. Aiken C.T. Kaltenbach L.S. Agrawal N. Illes K. Khoshnan A. et al.IKK phosphorylates Huntingtin and targets it for degradation by the proteasome and lysosome.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 1083-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 34Hegde R.N. Chiki A. Petricca L. Martufi P. Arbez N. Mouchiroud L. et al.TBK1 phosphorylates mutant Huntingtin and suppresses its aggregation and toxicity in Huntington's disease models.EMBO J. 2020; 39e104671Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To determine whether the two bands represent different phosphorylated forms of Htt, we treated cells with a general serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, staurosporine (STS), or a general phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid (OA). STS treatment increased the intensity of the lower band, whereas OA treatment accumulated the upper band, suggesting that the upper band represents a phosphorylated form, whereas the lower band is dephosphorylated. This conclusion was confirmed using a phospho-specific antibody pS13 for Htt (34Hegde R.N. Chiki A. Petricca L. Martufi P. Arbez N. Mouchiroud L. et al.TBK1 phosphorylates mutant Huntingtin and suppresses its aggregation and toxicity in Huntington's disease models.EMBO J. 2020; 39e104671Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which recognized only the upper band (Fig. 1, H and I). More importantly, STS treatment increased Htt secretion, whereas OA treatment reduced its secretion (Fig. 1, J and K), indicating that the dephosphorylated aggregate-prone form of Htt is preferentially secreted compared with the phosphorylated soluble form of Htt. Taken together, these results demonstrate that unconventional secretion is selective, at least to a certain degree, and may serve as a clearing mechanism for cells to expel toxic proteins. It has been demonstrated that unconventional secretion is elevated under different stress conditions when the autophagy level is high (35Giuliani F. Grieve A. Rabouille C. Unconventional secretion: a stress on GRASP.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2011; 23: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and that unconventional secretion of CFTR and Acb1 depends on autophagy or autophagy genes (36Noh S.H. Gee H.Y. Kim Y. Piao H.

Cell Biol. 2011; 195: 979-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition, we discovered that GRASP55 functions as an energy sensor through O-GlcNAcylation to regulate autophagosome maturation. Under growth conditions, GRASP55 is O-GlcNAcylated and concentrated on the Golgi. Upon glucose starvation, GRASP55 is de-O-GlcNAcylated and relocated from the Golgi to the interface between autophagosomes and lysosomes, where it interacts with LC3 on autophagosomes and lysosomal membrane–associated protein 2 (LAMP2) on lysosomes and functions as a membrane tether to facilitate autophagosome–lysosome fusion (38Zhang X.

Similar responses of GRASP55 occur under amino acid starvation or when mammalian target of rapamycin activity is inhibited by Torin 1 (38Zhang X. Wang L. Lak B. Li J. Jokitalo E. Wang Y.

Wang Y. GRASP55 facilitates autophagosome maturation under glucose deprivation.Mol. Cell Oncol. 2018; 5e1494948Google Scholar). In addition, GRASP55 also interacts with Beclin-1 to facilitate the assembly and membrane association of the UVRAG phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex, and thereby facilitates autophagosome maturation (39Zhang X.

These observations prompted us to test the effect of energy deprivation and nutrient starvation on Htt secretion. As expected, both glucose starvation and amino acid deprivation (E, by incubating cells in Earle′s balanced salt solution [EBSS]) increased the level of Htt in the conditioned media compared with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (D) (Fig. 2, A and B). A similar effect was observed in 55KO cells, although the overall secretion was significantly lower than WT cells. In addition to starvation, inhibiting proteasomal degradation with MG132, or inducing ER stress with tunicamycin (Tu), both enhanced Htt secretion (Fig. 2, C–F). Under these experimental conditions, no cell death was detected by the LDH cytotoxicity assay (Fig. S2C). These results confirm that Htt secretion is elevated under stress conditions. The fact that GRASP55 localization and function are regulated by cellular stressors suggests that GRASP55 may serve as both a stress sensor and an effector (41Zhang X. Wang Y. Nonredundant roles of GRASP55 and GRASP65 in the Golgi apparatus and beyond.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2020; 45: 1065-1079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition to its relocalization from the Golgi to autophagosomes under starvation conditions (38Zhang X. Wang L. Lak B. Li J. Jokitalo E. Wang Y. GRASP55 senses glucose deprivation through O-GlcNAcylation to promote autophagosome-lysosome fusion.Dev. Cell. 2018; 45: 245-261.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we wondered whether GRASP55 level might also be upregulated to meet the high demand for its roles in Golgi structure formation, autophagy, and unconventional secretion in response to stress. To test this hypothesis, we incubated WT HeLa cells in EBSS for 0, 2, 4, and 8 h and measured GRASP55 level by Western blot. Indeed, EBSS treatment increased GRASP55 expression but had no significant effect on other Golgi proteins we tested, including GRASP65, Golgin-160, Golgin-97, and GCC88 (Fig. 3, A and B). The elevation of GRASP55 expression was not limited to amino acid starvation, as it also applied to ER stress. When cells were treated with ER stress inducers, including Tu, thapsigargin, and DTT, the level of GRASP55 but not that of other Golgi proteins increased (Fig. 3, C and D). Since mutant Htt forms aggregates that could induce proteostasis stress, we tested the effect of Htt-Q23 and Htt-Q74 on GRASP55 expression. Both Htt-Q23 and Htt-Q74 expression increased GRASP55 level in cells, although Htt-Q74 exhibited a stronger effect (Fig. S2, D and E). To validate this observation in mice, we took advantage of a previously established knock-in mouse model that expresses full-length Htt-Q200 in the brain (28Gerson J.E. Safren N. Fischer S. Patel R.

Genet. 2010; 19: 3702-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These studies have shown that expression of Htt-Q200 upregulated both LC3-II and p62 levels compared with control, indicating an enhanced autophagosome formation but reduced lysosomal degradation. This conclusion was validated in our Htt mice and cell samples, as indicated by p62 accumulation (Figs. 3, E and F, S2, D and E) (42Heng M.Y. Duong D.K. Albin R.L. Tallaksen-Greene S.J. Hunter J.M. Lesort M.J. et al.Early autophagic response in a novel knock-in model of Huntington disease.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 3702-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In response to the proteostasis stress, GRASP55 level was also elevated in the brain tissues, whereas other proteins such as GRASP65 and GM130 did not change (Fig. 3, E and F). Taken together, GRASP55 level is upregulated by cellular stress and Htt expression, possibly to meet the high demand of unconventional secretion. The fact that GRASP55 expression, autophagy, and unconventional secretion are all elevated under stress conditions implies that these events are related. To test if Htt secretion depends on autophagy, we expressed GFP-Htt-Q74 in the ATG7 KO mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line established by Dr Masaaki Komatsu (43Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T.

Machine learning (ML) is one of the modern approaches that have been applied by physicians to help decision-making. The main objective of this study was to identify the cost differences of the ML-based strategy compared with other strategies in preoperative blood products preparation. A secondary objective was to compare the effectiveness indexes of blood products preparation among strategies.The study utilized a retrospective cohort design conducted on brain tumor patients who had undergone surgery between January 2014 and December 2021. Overall data were divided into two cohorts. The first cohort was used for the development and deployment of the ML-based web application, while validation, comparison of the effectiveness indexes, and economic evaluation were performed using the second cohort. Therefore, the effectiveness indexes of blood preparation and cost difference were compared among the ML-based strategy, clinical trial-based strategy, and routine-based strategy.Over a 2-year period, the crossmatch to transfusion (C/T) ratio, transfusion probability (Tp), and transfusion index (Ti) of the ML-based strategy were 1.10, 57.0%, and 1.62, respectively, while the routine-based strategy had a C/T ratio of 4.67%, Tp of 27.9%%, and Ti of 0.79. The overall costs of blood products preparation among the ML-based strategy, clinical trial-based strategy, and routine-based strategy were 30, 061.56$, 57,313.92$, and 136,292.94$, respectively. From the cost difference between the ML-based strategy and routine-based strategy, we observed cost savings of 92,519.97$ (67.88%) for the 2-year period.The ML-based strategy is one of the most effective strategies to balance the unnecessary workloads at blood banks and reduce the cost of unnecessary blood products preparation from low C/T ratio as well as high Tp and Ti. Further studies should be performed to confirm the generalizability and applicability of the ML-based strategy."

This study analyzed the agreement between maximum and mean HGS measurements in identifying probable sarcopenia in cancer patients. Methods Adult individuals of both sexes diagnosed with malignant neoplasm were evaluated. HGS (kg/f) was measured in both hands and nutritional status defined by the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). Bland-Altman, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), and Cronbach’s Alpha tests were applied to assess the agreement between measurements. Results One hundred forty-one patients aged 60.0 ± 14.2 years were evaluated. There was a predominance of elderly (57.4%), male (53.2%), and non-white (58.2%) individuals, with tumors located in the lower gastrointestinal tract (GIT) (36.9%) and with suspected or some degree of malnutrition (61.0%). For men, the Bland-Altman test showed a mean error of 1.37 (95% CI—1.03 to 3.80) for dominant HGS (DHGS) and 1.50 (95% CI—1.60 to 4.60) for non-dominant HGS (NDHGS), while for women the values were 1.34 (95% CI—0.27 to 2.95) and 1.14 (95% CI—1.10 to 3.39), respectively. The ICC showed excellent reproducibility (&gt; 0.90) and the Cronbach’s Alpha was satisfactory (0.99). Conclusion Despite the satisfactory agreement observed between maximum and mean HGS values, in this study, individuals of both sexes with probable sarcopenia were better identified through mean values."
https://openalex.org/W4283714137,"Energy-converting hydrogenases (Ech) are ancient, membrane-bound enzymes that use reduced ferredoxin (Fd) as an electron donor to reduce protons to molecular H2. Experiments with whole cells, membranes and vesicle-fractions suggest that proton reduction is coupled to proton translocation across the cytoplasmatic membrane, but this has never been demonstrated with a purified enzyme. To this end, we produced a His-tagged Ech complex in the thermophilic and anaerobic bacterium Thermoanaerobacter kivui. The enzyme could be purified by affinity chromatography from solubilized membranes with full retention of its eight subunits, as well as full retention of physiological activities, i.e., H2-dependent Fd reduction and Fd2--dependent H2 production. We found the purified enzyme contained 34.2 ± 12.2 mol of iron/mol of protein, in accordance with seven predicted [4Fe-4S]-clusters and one [Ni-Fe]-center. The pH and temperature optima were at 7 to 8 and 66 °C, respectively. Notably, we found that the enzymatic activity was inhibited by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an agent known to bind ion-translocating glutamates or aspartates buried in the cytoplasmic membrane and thereby inhibiting ion transport. To demonstrate the function of the Ech complex in ion transport, we further established a procedure to incorporate the enzyme complex into liposomes in an active state. We show the enzyme did not require Na+ for activity and did not translocate 22Na+ into the proteoliposomal lumen. In contrast, Ech activity led to the generation of a pH gradient and membrane potential across the proteoliposomal membrane, demonstrating that the Ech complex of T. kivui is a H+-translocating, H+-reducing enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W4283720123,"Mitochondrial translation is a highly regulated process, and newly synthesized mitochondrial products must first associate with several nuclear-encoded auxiliary factors to form oxidative phosphorylation complexes. The output of mitochondrial products should therefore be in stoichiometric equilibrium with the nuclear-encoded products to prevent unnecessary energy expense or the accumulation of pro-oxidant assembly modules. In the mitochondrial DNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, COX1 encodes subunit 1 of the cytochrome c oxidase and COB the central core of the cytochrome bc1 electron transfer complex; however, factors regulating the expression of these mitochondrial products are not completely described. Here, we identified Mrx9p as a new factor that controls COX1 and COB expression. We isolated MRX9 in a screen for mitochondrial factors that cause poor accumulation of newly synthesized Cox1p and compromised transition to the respiratory metabolism. Northern analyses indicated lower levels of COX1 and COB mature mRNAs accompanied by an accumulation of unprocessed transcripts in the presence of excess Mrx9p. In a strain devoid of mitochondrial introns, MRX9 overexpression did not affect COX1 and COB translation or respiratory adaptation, implying Mrx9p regulates processing of COX1 and COB RNAs. In addition, we found Mrx9p was localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane, facing the matrix, as a portion of it cosedimented with mitoribosome subunits and its removal or overexpression altered Mss51p sedimentation. Finally, we showed accumulation of newly synthesized Cox1p in the absence of Mrx9p was diminished in cox14 null mutants. Taken together, these data indicate a regulatory role of Mrx9p in COX1 RNA processing."
https://openalex.org/W4283767724,"Despite paclitaxel’s wide use in cancer treatment, patient response rate is still low and drug resistance is a major clinical obstacle. Through a Phos-tag-based kinome-wide screen, we identified MARK2 as a critical regulator for paclitaxel chemosensitivity in PDAC. We show that MARK2 is phosphorylated by CDK1 in response to antitubulin chemotherapeutics and in unperturbed mitosis. Phosphorylation is essential for MARK2 in regulating mitotic progression and paclitaxel cytotoxicity in PDAC cells. Mechanistically, our findings also suggest that MARK2 controls paclitaxel chemosensitivity by regulating class IIa HDACs. MARK2 directly phosphorylates HDAC4 specifically during antitubulin treatment. Phosphorylated HDAC4 promotes YAP activation and controls expression of YAP target genes induced by paclitaxel. Importantly, combination of HDAC inhibition and paclitaxel overcomes chemoresistance in organoid culture and preclinical PDAC animal models. The expression levels of MARK2, HDACs, and YAP are upregulated and positively correlated in PDAC patients. Inhibition of MARK2 or class IIa HDACs potentiates paclitaxel cytotoxicity by inducing mitotic abnormalities in PDAC cells. Together, our findings identify the MARK2-HDAC axis as a druggable target for overcoming chemoresistance in PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W4283776865,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is still causing morbidity and mortality all over the world. Preventive measures such as wearing a facemask, social distancing and hand hygiene continue to be the only options available in countries such as Ethiopia where vaccines are not yet widely available. Hand hygiene is one of the easiest and cheapest preventive measures, and one that is especially important for barbers and beauty salon workers who are widely exposed to the virus due to their contact with many customers. Therefore, measuring the proportion of good hand hygiene practices and associated factors among barbers and beauty salon workers may provide essential guidance in the development of effective interventions to improve COVID-19 prevention measures. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 410 barbers and beauty salon workers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town from January 5 to February 10, 2021. The study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique. A structured questionnaire and an observational checklist were used to collect the data. The collected data were entered into EpiData version 4.6 and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0. Logistic regression analysis using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models was employed. From the bivariate analysis, variables with p <0.25 were retained into multivariable logistic regression analysis. Finally, from the multivariable analysis, variables that had a p-value < 0.05 were declared as factors significantly associated with good hand hygiene practices. Of the total 410 barbers and beauty salon workers, 52.9% [95% CI: 48.3-57.6] had good hand hygiene practices whereas 47.1% [95% CI: 42.4-51.7] had poor hand hygiene practices. From the total respondents, more than half 250 (61%) were male and 160 (39%) were female, with a mean age of 27.42 ±7.37 years. Out of 410 barbers and beauty salon workers, 73.7% had good knowledge about COVID-19 and 59.5% had a positive attitude towards taking precautions against COVID-19. Female sex (AOR = 2.17, 95% CI:1.29-3.65), educational level of college or above (AOR = 5.53, 95% CI:2.85-10.71), positive attitude towards taking precautions against COVID-19 (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI:1.46-4.17), belief in the effectiveness of hand hygiene practices (AOR = 3.78, 95% CI:2.18-6.55) and presence of a hand-washing facility with soap and water (AOR = 5.55, 95% CI:3.28-9.40) were factors significantly associated with good hand hygiene practices among barbers and beauty salon workers. The proportion of good hand hygiene practice was not sufficient to combat the virus. Good hand hygiene practice was higher among those with higher educational level, positive attitude towards taking precautions against COVID-19, belief in the effectiveness of hand hygiene practices, presence of a hand-washing facility with soap and water and those of female sex. Thus, improving hand hygiene practices through continued training, especially for those with a lower educational level and for male workers, is recommended. Moreover, government and non-government organizations should work together to provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer at a low cost to those barbershops and beauty salons if there is no access to water and soap."

However, the intestine compartment-specific target genes of VD signaling are unknown. Here, we examined VD action across three functional compartments of the intestine using RNA-seq to measure VD-induced changes in gene expression and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation with next generation sequencing to measure vitamin D receptor (VDR) genomic binding. We found that VD regulated the expression of 55 shared transcripts in the SI crypt, SI villi, and in the colon, including Cyp24a1, S100g, Trpv6, and Slc30a10. Other VD-regulated transcripts were unique to the SI crypt (162 up, 210 down), villi (199 up, 63 down), or colon (102 up, 28 down), but this did not correlate with mRNA levels of the VDR. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis identified unique VD-regulated biological functions in each compartment. VDR-binding sites were found in 70% of upregulated genes from the colon and SI villi but were less common in upregulated genes from the SI crypt and among downregulated genes, suggesting some transcript-level VD effects are likely indirect. Consistent with this, we show that VD regulated the expression of other transcription factors and their downstream targets. Finally, we demonstrate that compartment-specific VD-mediated gene expression was associated with compartment-specific VDR-binding sites (<30% of targets) and enrichment of intestinal transcription factor–binding motifs within VDR-binding peaks.

Vitamin D is an important nutrient with critical regulatory actions on intestinal physiology and function (1Christakos S. Vitamin D: a critical regulator of intestinal physiology.JBMR Plus. 2021; 5e10554Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Vitamin D is metabolized to become 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), a hormone that activates the vitamin D receptor (VDR) to mediate the transcription of target genes. VDR-mediated gene transcription is a multistep process that involves VDR binding to target genes at both active promoters and distal regulatory elements as well as recruitment of coregulatory proteins (2Pike J.W. Christakos S. Biology and mechanisms of action of the vitamin D hormone.Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 2017; 46: 815-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although 1,25(OH)2D3 has been reported to regulate physiological processes in many tissues, the highest levels of VDR are present in the intestine, the major 1,25(OH)2D3 target tissue (3Lee S.M.

Studies in VDR null mice showed that deletion of VDR causes the loss of active calcium absorption in the proximal intestine, leading to hypocalcemia and rickets (5Van Cromphaut S.J. Dewerchin M.

In addition, intestine-specific transgenic expression of VDR in VDR null mice normalized calcium absorption, serum calcium, and prevented the development of rickets (6Xue Y.B. Fleet J.C.

These findings indicate that a primary role of VDR and 1,25(OH)2D3 signaling during growth is the regulation of intestinal calcium absorption needed for calcium homeostasis and bone mineralization. Although most studies have focused on the duodenum, our recent studies have shown that the distal segments of the intestine also play an important role in VDR-mediated intestinal calcium absorption and bone mineralization (7Dhawan P.

In addition to maintenance of calcium homeostasis, many other beneficial intestinal effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 have been described including anti-inflammatory effects, maintenance of intestinal barrier function, and protection against colitis and colon cancer, suggesting the existence of multiple, diverse 1,25(OH)2D3 functions across the length of the intestine (1Christakos S. Vitamin D: a critical regulator of intestinal physiology.JBMR Plus. 2021; 5e10554Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In addition to functional differences that exist along the proximal-to-distal axis, the proximal segments of the intestine have epithelial cells organized along a crypt–villus axis. Several studies have shown that 1,25(OH)2D3 action varies along the crypt–villus axis. In duodenal mid-villus cells, 1,25(OH)2D3 rapidly stimulates calcium extrusion (10Walters J.R. Weiser M.M. Calcium transport by rat duodenal villus and crypt basolateral membranes.Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: G170-G177PubMed Google Scholar) but slower effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on crypt cells program the intestine for improved calcium absorption as the cells differentiate and migrate into the villus (11Wu J.C. Smith M.W. Lawson D.E. Time dependency of 1,25(OH)2D3 induction of calbindin mRNA and calbindin expression in chick enterocytes during their differentiation along the crypt-villus axis.Differentiation. 1992; 51: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, VDR loss increases colon epithelial cell proliferation and alters the contribution of Lgr5+ stem cells to the maintenance of the intestinal epithelium (12DeLuca H.F. Franceschi R.T.

In spite of the recognized regulatory role of 1,25(OH)2D3–VDR signaling in intestinal biology, the mechanisms involved in VDR-mediated regulation of these diverse functions remain incomplete and genomic studies of 1,25(OH)2D3 action in the intestine are sparse. In addition, the diversity and complexity of 1,25(OH)2D3 signaling with respect to proximal–distal and crypt–villus axes have not as yet been evaluated when considering intestinal 1,25(OH)2D3 action. In this study, we used a series of complementary genomic tools (i.e., RNA-seq, VDR ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq) to identify 1,25(OH)2D3-responsive target genes across the proximal-distal and small intestine (SI) crypt–villus axis. Our findings show that while a number of 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated genes are common across SI villus, SI crypt, and colon, the majority of 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated transcripts have compartment-restricted regulation patterns. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis of the 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated transcripts from each compartment indicated regulation of unique biological functions, independent of calcium homeostasis, including regulation of RNA metabolic processes, tight junctions, metabolism of xenobiotics, lipid metabolic processes, and HIF1 signaling. However, not all VDR-regulated genes have VDR-binding peaks, suggesting that some transcript levels effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 are indirect and may be due in part to the contribution of other transcription factors. Our findings are the first to define 1,25(OH)2D3-molecular actions across the critical proximal–distal and crypt–villus axes that define the functional characteristics of the intestine and suggest novel mechanisms that may account for intestine compartment-specific functions of 1,25(OH)2D3. We confirmed the quality of our isolation of the various intestinal segments in two ways. First, we visually examined the small intestinal villus and crypt preparations to confirm that they were pure (see Fig. S1 for representative pictures of the isolated small intestinal crypts and villi). In addition, we examined our RNA-seq data to identify the transcript level differences across the three compartments. As expected, there were many differentially expressed genes between the small intestinal villus [5,114, 1% false detection rate (FDR), 2-fold change] or crypts (3554 differentially expressed gene (DEG)) and the colon. This included 135-fold higher mRNA levels of the SI marker lactase (Lct) in the villus versus colon and a 189-fold greater expression of the colon marker, carbonic anhydrase 1 (Car1) mRNA, in colon versus villus (Table S1). In the 3669 DEG we observed between the crypt and villus compartments, we observed that transcripts for markers of differentiated small intestinal epithelial cells were enriched in the SI villus (Lct, 3.49 up, S100g, 3.56 up, Trpv6, 3.71 up), while expression of the intestinal stem cell marker Lgr5 was elevated significantly in crypts (+12.2 fold). Collectively, these compartment-level differences in transcript levels confirm the quality of our isolation procedure. A summary of the impact of 1,25(OH)2 D treatment on intestinal gene expression is presented in Table S2. As expected, 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment significantly induced the expression of several genes known to be involved in intestinal calcium absorption; Trpv6, S100g, and Atp2b1 (Fig. 1). In addition, our analysis showed that Vdr mRNA levels were not dramatically different across segments nor were they strongly regulated by 1,25(OH)2 D treatment (Fig. 1B). Figure 2 shows that 968 transcripts were differentially regulated by 1,25(OH)2 D across the three compartments at the 5% FDR (A Venn Diagram showing the differentially expressed genes at 10% FDR is provided as Fig. S2.) Only 55 of these genes were common across all compartments (including the known 1,25(OH)2D3 target genes Cyp24a1, Trpv6, S100g, Slc30a10, and Atp2b1), while 78% of the 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated transcripts were specific to just one compartment. Ninety three percent of the 55 common targets were upregulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment. Similarly, more than 80% of 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated genes in the SI villus and colon were induced. In contrast, only 56% of SI crypt transcripts were upregulated.Figure 2Venn diagram depicting significantly differentially expressed transcripts in the small intestine crypt, small intestine villus, or colon. Mice were treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10 ng/g, 4 h) and RNA from the three compartments was used for RNA-seq analysis. Differential expression was determined using DeSeq2 (5% FDR).

One hundred seventy-nine of these matched to the 10% DEG list from at least one of the intestinal compartments (Table S2 and Fig. S3). Thirty eight transcripts were upregulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 in all three compartments and also in the Lee et al. dataset, including S100g, Trpv6, Atp2b1, Cyp24a1, and Slc30a10. We examined the 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated gene list from each compartment for enrichment of GO terms and pathways (Table 1 and Table S3 (Pathways), S4 (GO Up enrichment), and S5 (GO down enrichment)). Distinct functional categories of genes were identified for each compartment, including enrichment of GO terms for “lipid metabolic processes” and “ion transport” in villus, terms related to rRNA, RNA, and ncRNA processing in the crypts, and “Negative regulation of cell population proliferation” and “Regulation of Cell migration” in colon.Table 1Summary of GO enrichment for 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated genes by compartmentTissueEnrichmentTopicGenes in DEG listCryptUprRNA/RNA/ncRNA processing76Ribosome/cell component biogenesis103CryptDownResponse to chemical stimulus140Positive regulation of ion transport54VillusUpIon transport103Lipid metabolic processes72VillusDownPrimary metabolic processes78Cell activation22ColonUpNegative regulation of cell population proliferation39Regulation of cell migration43ColonDownCell developmental processes33Regulation of cellular component organization24 Open table in a new tab Using VDR ChIP-seq, we found many 1,25(OH)2D3-induced VDR-binding peaks in each intestinal compartment: 12,719 in SI crypt, 18,083 in SI villus, and 22,888 in colon. The ChIP-Seq signal was similar across compartments and VDR ChIP peaks averaged ∼ 1000 bp wide (Fig. 3A). Included in our VDR ChIP-seq peaks were the previously reported VDR-binding peaks in the Cyp24a1 gene (TSS at -0.2 kb and downstream enhancer peaks at +35, +37, +39, and +43 kb); the Trpv6 gene (at -2, -4 kb); and Slc30a10 gene (e.g. robust peaks at +29, +32, and +48 kb) (14Lee S.M. Riley E.M. Meyer M.B. Benkusky N.A. Plum L.A. DeLuca H.F. et al.1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 controls a cohort of vitamin D receptor target genes in the proximal intestine that is enriched for calcium-regulating components.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 18199-18215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). More than 60% of the VDR-binding peaks in the SI villus and crypt and 44% of the VDR-binding peaks in the colon coincided with the ATAC-Seq peaks from these same tissues (See Fig. S4). In contrast, some 1,25(OH)2D3-induced VDR peaks did not coincide with an ATAC-seq peak and this suggests that 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment revealed regulatory sites that were either silent under basal conditions or under the ATAC detection limit in untreated mouse intestine (e.g. Fig. S5 for the Slc30a10 gene). An evaluation of the VDR-binding peaks for known transcription factor binding site motifs revealed that the VDR-RXR DR3 motif was the most enriched motif in all three compartments (Fig. 3B and Table S6)). In addition, 16 other motifs for intestine-expressed transcription factors were enriched in the VDR ChIP-seq peaks (5% FDR, >1.5 fold enrichment over background DNA), including motifs for RAR, Bach1, HNF4a, JUN, and FOSL2 (in peaks from all three compartments); GATA4, YY1, MAFK (crypt and villus); HNF1, CEBP (crypt), and CDX2, TCF3, THRa (colon) (Fig. S6). We attributed the VDR-ChIP peaks to their nearest neighbor gene using GREAT in GSEA. This data was then used to identify the genes differentially expressed by 1,25(OH)2D3 that also had a VDR-binding peak associated with them (Fig. 3D). Approximately, 70% of the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced transcripts in SI villus and colon had a VDR-binding peak. In contrast, only 52% of 1,25(OH)2D3-induced crypt transcripts had VDR-binding peaks, while even fewer 1,25(OH)2D3-suppressed transcripts had them (villus 38.4%; colon 26.8%; SI crypt 21.1%). This suggests that the regulation of many genes, especially those induced in the crypt and suppressed in all compartments, were not direct 1,25(OH)2D3 target genes but may be a consequence of an upstream 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated event. One possibility for how 1,25(OH)2 D treatment could alter transcript levels independent of VDR binding to a gene regulatory region is that 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates the expression of other transcription factors that have 1,25(OH)2D3-independent downstream actions. Consistent with this hypothesis, bioinformatic analysis identified the protein class “transcription factors” as enriched in the 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated genes from crypt and colon (Table S7). In addition, we found that, of the transcription factors expressed in the colon (n = 307) or the SI (n = 348) of mice (15Zhou Q. Liu M. Xia X. Gong T. Feng J. Liu W. et al.A mouse tissue transcription factor atlas.Nat. Commun. 2017; 815089Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), 50 were differentially expressed by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment (16 induced and six suppressed transcription factor genes had a VDR binding site). Of the 50 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated transcription factor messages, 18 had enrichment of their downstream target genes in our dataset (Fig. 4 and Table S8). We next used Diffbind to compare VDR peaks across the three compartments to test whether compartment-specific regulation of genes by 1,25(OH)2 D treatment was due to differential binding of VDR to specific regulatory sites. Differential VDR binding was minimal between the small intestinal crypt and villus (80 crypt-enriched peaks, five villus-enriched peaks). In contrast, there were several hundred VDR peaks that were differentially enriched in either the colon or SI (Fig. 5A with images of the enriched peak profile in Fig. 5B). As shown in Figure 3, VDR peaks are more common for the induced genes so we evaluated the number of DEG with VDR-binding peaks that had both compartment-specific binding and induced expression. Our data show that fewer than 30% of the compartment-specific, differentially regulated transcripts also had compartment-specific differential VDR binding. This includes genes like Slc37a2, which has a VDR-binding site within an intronic enhancer in the SI that is absent in the colon, as well as Ptges, which has an VDR binding, intronic enhancer in colon that is lower in the SI (Fig. 5C). It is well established that 1,25(OH)2D3 is a critical regulator of intestinal physiology that controls calcium absorption (16Fleet J.C.

Despite these diverse effects, the genomic mechanisms used by 1,25(OH)2D3 to regulate intestinal biology remain unknown. Previous studies have focused on intestinal effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in the mature small intestinal enterocyte related primarily to calcium absorption or protection against barrier dysfunction (17Fujita H.

In contrast, effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in small intestinal crypts are only beginning to be defined and have been a matter of debate (10Walters J.R. Weiser M.M.

For example, it had been suggested that 1,25(OH)2D3 mediated transcription in intestinal villi but not in the crypts (23Reynolds C.J. Koszewski N.J. Horst R.L. Beitz D.C. Goff J.P. Localization of the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d-mediated response in the intestines of mice.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2019; 186: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We attempted to resolve this issue by examining the molecular actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 across multiple functional compartments in the intestine, that is, the SI crypt, the SI villus, and the colonic epithelium. Consistent with our recent study (8Li S. De La Cruz J. Hutchens S. Mukhopadhyay S. Criss Z.K. Aita R. et al.Analysis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 genomic action reveals calcium-regulating and calcium-independent effects in mouse intestine and human enteroids.Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 41e00372-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment induced genes controlling intestinal Ca absorption in the all three compartments (i.e., Cyp24a1, Trpv6, S100g, and Atp2b1). However, only a small number of the 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated gene targets were common across the three compartments (5.7% of the total DEG). Instead, the majority of 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated genomic events were distinct and compartment specific (Fig. 2). Thus, our study reveals a complexity to intestinal 1,25(OH)2D3 action that had not previously been appreciated in genomic studies using SI mucosal scrapings (14Lee S.M. Riley E.M. Meyer M.B. Benkusky N.A. Plum L.A. DeLuca H.F. et al.1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 controls a cohort of vitamin D receptor target genes in the proximal intestine that is enriched for calcium-regulating components.J.

A significant amount of research has been conducted to define the mechanisms controlling intestine-specific and intestine-segment–specific gene expression. This has defined transcription factors like CDX2, HNF4a/g, and GATA4/5/6 as central regulators of intestine cell identity (26Vierstra J. Rynes E. Sandstrom R. Zhang M. Canfield T. Hansen R.S. et al.Mouse regulatory DNA landscapes reveal global principles of cis-regulatory evolution.Science. 2014; 346: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and GATA6, SATB2, and KLF4 as colon-enriched transcription factors (15Zhou Q. Liu M. Xia X. Gong T. Feng J. Liu W. et al.A mouse tissue transcription factor atlas.Nat. Commun. 2017; 815089Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, few studies have explored how inducible gene expression is different across intestinal compartments. While there were only minor differences between VDR mRNA expression across the intestinal compartments, we found that ∼30% of compartment-specific 1,25(OH)2D3-induced transcripts could be explained by differential VDR binding to gene regulatory regions. Compartment-enriched VDR peaks were also found to differ in their enrichment of secondary transcription factor–binding motifs. This suggests that coordination between other transcription factors and VDR may contribute to differential binding and/or chromatin accessibility. For example, our findings of CDX2 and FOXA1 motifs at or near colon-enriched VDR-binding sites and HNF4a and GATA4 motifs at SI-enriched VDR-binding sites suggest that these transcription factors may promote or stabilize VDR binding at specific sites to mediate compartment-specific gene regulation. A stabilizing role would be similar to the role proposed for ETS1 in the regulation of 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated Cyp24a1 gene expression (27Dwivedi P.P. Omdahl J.L. Kola I. Hume D.K. May B.K. Regulation of rat cytochrome P450C24 (CYP24) gene expression - evidence for functional cooperation of Ras-activated Ets transcription factors with the vitamin D receptor in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3-mediated induction.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 47-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, these hypotheses must be formally tested. About 30% of the genes induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in SI villus and colon and 48% of 1,25(OH)2D3-induced crypt transcripts did not have VDR-binding peaks. Also, between 60 to 79% of 1,25(OH)2D3-suppressed transcripts in each of the three compartments lacked a VDR-binding site. Thus, VDR binding does not predict mRNA expression. One hypothesis to explain VDR-independent and compartment-specific regulation of genes is that it is indirectly mediated through other transcription factors. In support of this hypothesis, we found 10 transcription factor genes that contained VDR-binding sites were differentially regulated by 1,25(OH)2 D treatment, and whose downstream targets were differentially regulated by 1,25(OH)2 D despite lacking VDR-binding sites near their genes. In the SI, this includes genes for transcription factors like NFATC3, which regulates intestinal differentiation (28Wang Q. Zhou Y. Weiss H.L. Chow C.W. Evers B.M.

Given scarcity of resources, poor access to vaccines and medical therapies within low and middle income countries, there is an urgent need to identify other cost-effective alternatives in management of COVID-19 pneumonia. We conducted a pilot phase Ib/II investigator-initiated clinical trial to assess the safety, feasibility, and toxicity of LDRT in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. Additionally, we also assessed clinical benefit in terms of improvement in oxygenation at day 3 following LDRT and the ability to avoid mechanical ventilation at day 7 post LDRT. Methods Patients with both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and high-resolution computer tomogram (HRCT) confirmed severe COVID-19 pneumonia, not improving on conventional therapy including Dexamethasone and with increasing oxygen requirement were enrolled in the study. Patients on mechanical ventilation were excluded. Eligible patients received a single 100cGy fraction to the whole lung. In the absence of any dose limiting toxicity the study proposed to treat a total of 10 patients. The primary endpoints were to assess the safety/feasibility, and toxicity within the first 24 hours post LDRT. The secondary endpoints were to assess efficacy of LDRT at Day 3, 7, 14 and 28 post LDRT. Results Ten patients were treated with LDRT. All (100%) of patients were able to complete LDRT without treatment related SAE within the first 24 hours post treatment. None of the patients treated with LDRT experienced any acute toxicity as defined by change in clinical and respiratory status at 24hr following LDRT. Majority (90%) of patients avoided mechanical ventilation within 7 days of LDRT. Four patients (40%) demonstrated at least 25% improvement in oxygen requirements within 3 days. Six patients (60%) were discharged and remained off oxygen, whereas four progressed and died (1 due to sepsis and 3 in cytokine storm). Median time to discharge (n = 6) was 16.5 days and median time to death (n = 4) was 11.0 days. Patients who ultimately died showed elevated inflammatory markers including Ferritin, CRP and D-dimers as compared to those who were discharged alive. Conclusion LDRT was feasible, safe and shows promise in the management of severe COVID-19 pneumonia including in patients progressing on conventional systemic treatment. Additional phase II trials are warranted to identify patients most likely to benefit from LDRT."
https://openalex.org/W4283744275,"It is widely anticipated that a reduction of brain levels of the cellular prion protein (PrP C ) can prolong survival in a group of neurodegenerative diseases known as prion diseases. To date, efforts to decrease steady-state PrP C levels by targeting this protein directly with small molecule drug-like compounds have largely been unsuccessful. Recently, we reported Na,K-ATPases to reside in immediate proximity to PrP C in the brain, unlocking an opportunity for an indirect PrP C targeting approach that capitalizes on the availability of potent cardiac glycosides (CGs). Here, we report that exposure of human co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes to non-toxic nanomolar levels of CGs causes profound reductions in PrP C levels. The mechanism of action underpinning this outcome relies primarily on a subset of CGs engaging the ATP1A1 isoform, one of three α subunits of Na,K-ATPases expressed in brain cells. Upon CG docking to ATP1A1, the ligand receptor complex, and PrP C along with it, is internalized by the cell. Subsequently, PrP C is channeled to the lysosomal compartment where it is digested in a manner that can be rescued by silencing the cysteine protease cathepsin B. These data signify that the repurposing of CGs may be beneficial for the treatment of prion disorders."

Baseline data on such disturbances are required to induce countrywide interventional HIV/AIDS programs. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and risks of dyslipidemia in HIV patients on HAART medication in Eritrea.A cross sectional study was conducted on HIV/AIDS patients in two national referral hospitals in Asmara, Eritrea. A structured questionnaire was used to collect demographic data and blood sample was taken for analyses of lipid profile tests. Data was analyzed using chi-square test, Post Hoc and logistic regression in SPSS software.The study included 382 participants of whom 256(67%) were females. Their median age, CD4+ T cell count (cell/microliter) and duration of HAART (years) was 45(IQR: 38-51), 434(IQR: 294-583) & 5(IQR: 3-5) respectively. The prevalence of dyslipidemia was 331(86.6%). Increased Low Density Lipoprotein-C (LDL-C) 213(55.8%) was the predominant abnormality. Abacavir was significantly related with highest means of triglycerides (TG) (228.17 ± 193.81) and lowest means of High Density Lipoprotein (HDL-C) (46.94 ± 12.02). Females had substantially higher proportions of TG (aOR = 2.89, 95% CI: 1.65-5.05) and TC/HDL ratio (aOR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.40-3.87) and low HDL-C (aOR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.34-3.48). Increased age was related with increased pro-atherogenic lipid parameters. High LDL-C was more infrequent in non-smokers (aOR = 0.028, 95% CI: 0.12-0.69).The study showed a high prevalence of dyslipidemia in HIV-patients receiving HAART in Eritrea. Sex, age and smoking practice were among key factors associated with dyslipidemia. The necessity to assess lipid profiles and other cardiovascular risk factors before initiation of HAART treatment and continuous monitoring during therapy is mandatory."

https://openalex.org/W4283740953,"The Cullin-RING ligase 4 E3 ubiquitin ligase component Cereblon (CRBN) is a well-established target for a class of small molecules termed immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). These drugs drive CRBN to modulate the degradation of a number of neosubstrates required for the growth of multiple cancers. Whereas the mechanism underlying the activation of CRBN by IMiDs is well described, the normal physiological regulation of CRBN is poorly understood. We recently showed that CRBN is activated following exposure to Wnt ligands and subsequently mediates the degradation of a subset of physiological substrates. Among the Wnt-dependent substrates of CRBN is Casein kinase 1α (CK1α), a known negative regulator of Wnt signaling. Wnt-mediated degradation of CK1α occurs via its association with CRBN at a known IMiD binding pocket. Herein, we demonstrate that a small-molecule CK1α agonist, pyrvinium, directly prevents the Wnt-dependent interaction of CRBN with CK1α, attenuating the consequent CK1α degradation. We further show that pyrvinium disrupts the ability of CRBN to interact with CK1α at the IMiD binding pocket within the CRBN-CK1α complex. Of note, this function of pyrvinium is independent of its previously reported ability to enhance CK1α kinase activity. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that pyrvinium attenuates CRBN-induced Wnt pathway activation in vivo. Collectively, these results reveal a novel dual mechanism through which pyrvinium inhibits Wnt signaling by both attenuating the CRBN-mediated destabilization of CK1α and activating CK1α kinase activity."

This paper aims to construct the competency evaluation index system for front-line nurses during the outbreak of major infectious diseases. Materials and methods This study combined literature review, critical incident technique interviews, and semi-structured in-depth interviews, as well as two rounds of Delphi expert correspondence, to construct a competence evaluation index system for front-line nurses during the outbreak of major infectious diseases. The study used purposive sampling to select 26 experts from 11 provinces and cities across China to conduct two rounds of Delphi expert consultation, and the indicators were selected based on the mean importance score &gt; 3.5 and the coefficient of variation &lt; 0.25, and the weights of the indicators were calculated by the Analytic Hierarchy Process. The effective recovery rates of the two rounds of correspondence questionnaires were 93.1% and 96%. Results The effective recovery rates of the two rounds of correspondence questionnaires were 93.1% and 96%, the authority coefficients of experts were 0.96 and 0.98, the Kendall’s coordination coefficients of the first, second, and third level indexes were 0.281, 0.132, and 0.285 (P &lt; 0.001), 0.259, 0.158, and 0.415 (P &lt; 0.001). The final index system includes 4 primary indicators (Knowledge System of Infectious Diseases, Nursing Skills for Infectious Diseases, Related Professional Abilities for Infectious Diseases, and Comprehensive Quality), 10 secondary indicators, and 64 tertiary indicators. Conclusion The competency evaluation index system of front-line nurses during the outbreak of major infectious diseases is scientific, reasonable, and practical, which can provide a scientific basis for nursing managers to accurately understand, describe, analyze, and evaluate the competence level of nursing staff and scientifically implement the allocation of human resources in the future, as well as serve as a content framework for subsequent training programs."

The GEF activities of TrioN and TrioC are implicated in several cancers, especially uveal melanoma. However, little is known about how these modules operate in the context of larger fragments of Trio. Here we show via negative stain electron microscopy that the N-terminal region of Trio is extended and could thus serve as a rigid spacer between the N-terminal putative lipid-binding domain and TrioN, whereas the C-terminal half of Trio seems globular.

We went on to characterize a minimal, well-behaved Trio fragment with enhanced activity, Trio1284–1959, in complex with Rac1 using cryo-electron microscopy and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and found that the region conferring enhanced activity is disordered. Deletion of two different strongly conserved motifs in this region eliminated this enhancement, suggesting that they form transient intramolecular interactions that promote GEF activity.

Deletion of two different strongly conserved motifs in this region eliminated this enhancement, suggesting that they form transient intramolecular interactions that promote GEF activity. Because Dbl family RhoGEF modules have been challenging to directly target with small molecules, characterization of accessory Trio domains such as these may provide alternate routes for the development of therapeutics that inhibit Trio activity in human cancer. Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) (1Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. GEF means go: turning on RHO GTPases with guanine nucleotide-exchange factors.Nat. Rev. Mol.

RhoGEF dysregulation is well known to lead to oncogenic phenotypes including growth, migration, and metastasis (3Cook D.R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J.

In tumor xenograft models of metastatic uveal melanoma, knockdown of Trio is effective at reducing tumor size and weight, suggesting inhibitor molecules targeting Trio activity could serve as effective therapeutics (7Vaque J.P.

Hasegawa S. Maeda T. et al.An alternative transcript derived from the Trio locus encodes a guanosine nucleotide exchange factor with mouse cell-transforming potential.J. Biol.

The N-terminal GEF module of Trio (TrioN) catalyzes nucleotide exchange on Rac subfamily members, whereas the C-terminal module (TrioC) catalyzes nucleotide exchange on RhoA subfamily members (5Schmidt S. Debant A. Function and regulation of the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor Trio.Small GTPases. 2014; 5e29769Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Both TrioN and TrioC have been characterized structurally and functionally as standalone modules (11Skowronek K.R. Guo F. Zheng Y. Nassar N.

Understanding how the accessory regions and/or domains of Trio contribute to GEF activity may provide alternative therapeutic routes by which to modulate Trio function.Most RhoGEFs are large, multidomain proteins, and in other RhoGEFs, accessory regions have been shown to positively or negatively regulate GEF activity. For example, p115-RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and leukemia-associated RhoGEF are demarked by a regulator of G protein signaling homology domain that interacts with the heterotrimeric G protein Gα12/13 to positively regulate GEF activity in cells (17Aittaleb M.

Pharmacol. 2010; 77: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), whereas Asef, collybistin, and ephexin all contain adjacent SH3 domains that negatively regulate GEF activity (18Kim K.

Svergun D. et al.A conformational switch in collybistin determines the differentiation of inhibitory postsynapses.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 2113-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The functions of the accessory domains in Trio are primarily inferred by the roles of homologous domains in other proteins. The N-terminal Cral/Trio (CT) domain (Fig. 1) is homologous to Sec14 lipid transferase domains, which bind phosphoinositides or hydrophobic ligands (21Bankaitis V.A. Mousley C.J. Schaaf G.

Sec14p-like domains in NF1 and Dbl-like proteins indicate lipid regulation of Ras and Rho signaling.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R195-R197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One report further suggested that Dbl family CT domains could serve as a binding site for the G protein βγ (Gβγ) heterodimer (23Nishida K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. Association of the proto-oncogene product dbl with G protein betagamma subunits.FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The CT domain is followed by nine spectrin repeats (S1-S9), which are extended 3-helix bundles found in many proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton and expected to serve a structural role (24Djinovic-Carugo K. Gautel M. Ylanne J. Young P. The spectrin repeat: a structural platform for cytoskeletal protein assemblies.FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The TrioN GEF module is followed by a N-terminal Src homology 3 domain (SH3N), which canonically binds to proline-rich sequences containing the motif PXXP (25Kaneko T. Li L. Li S.S. The SH3 domain--a family of versatile peptide- and protein-recognition module.Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 4938-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), as it does in Kalirin, a close homolog of Trio (26Schiller M.R. Chakrabarti K. King G.F. Schiller N.I. Eipper B.A. Maciejewski M.W. Regulation of RhoGEF activity by intramolecular and intermolecular SH3 domain interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18774-18786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Next is the TrioC module followed by another SH3 domain (C-terminal Src homology 3 [SH3C]). The next domain is an Ig-like domain that one report concluded binds to activated RhoA and thereby contributes to the localization of Trio on the plasma membrane (27Medley Q.G. Serra-Pages C. Iannotti E. Seipel K. Tang M. O'Brien S.P. et al.The Trio guanine nucleotide exchange factor is a RhoA target. Binding of RhoA to the Trio immunoglobulin-like domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36116-36123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Trio ends with a protein kinase domain that belongs to the Ca2+·calmodulin kinase subfamily followed by an autoinhibitory C-terminal helical signature that interacts with Ca2+·calmodulin in functional members of the family. However, activity for the Trio kinase domain has yet to be reported.Aside from the isolated functions of the individual Trio domains, it is also important to study how they function in context of the full-length protein. A region encompassing the spectrin repeats, TrioN GEF module, and SH3N domain has been shown as the minimal region of Trio necessary to stimulate neurite outgrowth in cells (28Estrach S. Schmidt S. Diriong S. Penna A. Blangy A. Fort P. et al.The Human Rho-GEF Trio and its target GTPase RhoG are involved in the NGF pathway, leading to neurite outgrowth.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 307-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, the heterotrimeric G protein Gαq has been shown to directly bind to the TrioC GEF module and stimulate RhoA exchange by relieving intramolecular autoinhibition within the TrioC module (13Bandekar S.J.

Coco C. et al.Trio's Rho-specific GEF domain is the missing Gαq effector in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2731-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, in cells where full-length Trio is present, Gαq stimulates both TrioN and TrioC GEF activity (6Feng X. Degese M.S. Iglesias-Bartolome R. Vaque J.P. Molinolo A.A.

Cell. 2013; 49: 94-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether Gαq signaling leads to activation of the TrioN module by mechanisms other than membrane recruitment.In this study, we hypothesized that adjacent regions or domains could modulate the activity of the Trio GEF modules in either positive or negative ways, as implied by studies with the Kalirin SH3N domain (26Schiller M.R. Chakrabarti K. King G.F. Schiller N.I. Eipper B.A. Maciejewski M.W. Regulation of RhoGEF activity by intramolecular and intermolecular SH3 domain interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18774-18786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and be part of a larger regulatory framework controlled by Gαq. To test this theory, we purified various fragments of human Trio and compared their GEF activities, structures, and dynamics. Our negative stain electron microscopy (EM) data are consistent with the N-terminal half of Trio existing in an extended conformation dominated by the spectrin repeats and the middle of the protein containing both RhoGEF modules and their SH3 domains in a globular configuration, suggesting that these signaling domains and their extended linker regions could be closely associated. Our results are consistent with Gαq regulating TrioC as a standalone module that is not obviously influenced by surrounding regions, but with TrioN being profoundly activated by conserved elements within a disordered region C terminal to the SH3N domain. However, these elements were not ordered in high resolution cryo-EM maps or evidenced in hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) measurements. Our work thus further illuminates a network of intramolecular and intermolecular protein–protein interactions that underlie regulation in full-length Trio.ResultsNegative stain EM characterization of Trio fragments provides insights into overall architecture of TrioTo capture snapshots of the overall configuration of Trio, we first attempted to purify Trio fragments starting from the N terminus. The largest successfully purified to homogeneity (TrioMBP-61-1594) contained the CT domain, nine spectrin repeats, and TrioN. The protein was studied as the maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion because it aggregated when MBP was cleaved. Negative stain EM micrographs revealed an extended particle with ∼45 nm maximum length (Fig. 1, B and C). The TrioMBP-61-1594 particle (Inset, Fig. 1B) has a globular head, likely representing MBP and the CT domain, followed by a thin extended tail region of about 40 nm that likely corresponds to the spectrin repeat region of Trio. A fully extended length of 45 nm is estimated for the repeats from a model containing fully extended nine copies of the spectrin repeat. In comparison, the solution structure of the seven spectrin repeats of plectin is a rod-like structure of 35 nm, which would also correspond to 45 nm if there were nine repeats (32Ortega E. Manso J.A. Buey R.M. Carballido A.M. Carabias A. Sonnenberg A. et al.The structure of the plakin domain of plectin reveals an extended rod-like shape.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 18643-18662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In Trio, the shorter length may be accounted for by curvature and flexibility in the spectrin repeats. Some TrioMBP-61-1594 particles were for example shaped roughly like an “S” or a “C” (Fig. 1B, insets). The particle heterogeneity indicated that a 3D reconstruction using this N-terminal fragment would be challenging. Because longer Trio fragments starting at the N-terminus could not be purified, we decided to purify fragments beginning at the putative globular domains of Trio, beginning with TrioN (residue 1284). We initially purified and imaged the Trio1284-2638 fragment, which included TrioN through SH3C (Fig. 1C). Micrographs revealed a globular particle with a diameter of ∼10 nm, but this particle did not exhibit any discernible features in 2D averages (Fig. S1). Larger Trio fragments including the Ig and kinase domains did not express. Therefore, we decided to proceed with functional experiments on the central region of Trio containing the catalytic domains and their associated SH3 domains.Basal and Gαq-stimulated GEF activity of Trio variantsUsing a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based GEF assay (Fig. S2), we first confirmed that the individual TrioN and TrioC GEF modules activate only their cognate substrates (Rac1 and RhoA, respectively, in our experiments) 3- to 4-fold (Fig. 2A). To test whether the presence of other regions affected this basal GEF activity, we compared the activity of the isolated GEF modules to that of Trio1284-2638. Trio1284-2638 had similar GEF activity on RhoA as TrioC in isolation, but 8-fold higher activity on Rac1 than TrioN in isolation (Fig. 2B). Gαq·GDP·AlF4- enhanced Trio1284-2638 RhoA GEF activity to the same extent as TrioC (∼2.5-fold) but had no effect on Rac1 exchange activity (Figs. 2B and S3). Therefore, Gαq seems agnostic to sequences outside the TrioC module. To identify the residues responsible for enhanced Rac1 GEF activity of TrioN, we generated a series of truncations (Fig. 3). These proteins started with residue 1284 at the N terminus of TrioN and ended at residue 1718 (after SH3N), 1959 (after a ∼240 residue linker region), 2290 (after TrioC), 2616 (after SH3C), and 2780 (after the Ig domain). Constructs larger than this did not express or behave well. Each variant was tested for activity versus TrioN or TrioC in paired experiments (Fig. 3). Constructs ending at residue 1959 or later displayed 3- to 7-fold enhanced GEF activity on Rac1 relative to TrioN alone, with Trio1284-2616 having the highest rate (Fig. 3A), similar to the rate observed for Trio1284-2638. All the variants that included the TrioC GEF module had similar activity on RhoA relative to TrioC alone (Fig. 3B).Figure 2GEF assays show enhanced Rac1 but not RhoA exchange in larger Trio fragments and that Gαq regulation of TrioC is insensitive to adjacent regions.

We chose Trio1284-1959 for this analysis because its molecular weight (78 kDa) was potentially large enough to get a high resolution reconstruction and also because it was the most well-behaved and highest yielding Trio variant. Furthermore, it is composed of a relatively simple system of three structural domains (DH, PH, and SH3N), which would facilitate modeling if the resolution of the reconstruction were low. The Trio1284-1959–Rac1 complex was first profiled by negative stain EM (Fig. S4), yielding particles about 10 nm in diameter that seemed to have better detail than particles of Trio1284-2638 alone (Fig. S1). Cryo-EM single particle analysis ultimately yielded a 2.9 Å map (Fig. 4), which is unusually high resolution for what ended up being a ∼55 kDa structure (not considering regions that ended up disordered). To fit the map, the crystal structure of the TrioN–Rac1 complex (PDB entry 2NZ8) was placed into the map, then subjected to multiple rounds of model building and real space refinement (Fig. 4, Table 1, and Fig. S5). The final model contains residues 1 to 177 of Rac1, and residues 1284 to 1594 of Trio. However, there was no obvious density for any domain or residues C terminal to the Trio PH domain. Comparison of the complex, which may be the first of a RhoGEF DH/PH module by single particle cryo-EM, with that of the TrioN–Rac1 crystal structure reveals few differences (Fig. S5). More residues of the PH domain are ordered in the cryo-EM structure, and the domain is rotated about 4° with respect to the DH domain relative to that of the crystal structure. The register of the β5 strand of the PH domain is different, but the new cryo-EM structure agrees with the register of the model in the crystal structure of TrioN alone (PDB entry 1NTY). Density for the N-terminal helix of the cryo-EM DH domain extends outward by eight additional residues, and residues 26 to 31 in Switch 1 of Rac1 adopt a markedly different conformation. Most of the differences between the models seem to be a consequence of lattice contacts in the 2NZ8 structure, which occur near Switch 1 of Rac1 and at the hinge region of the DH/PH module. Furthermore, if the N-terminus of Trio in 2NZ8 were extended as a helix as far as it is in the cryo-EM structure, it would cause a steric clash with a lattice contact. This suggests that a cryo-EM structure, even at a lower nominal resolution of 2.9 Å, can potentially yield more detail and, perhaps, a more native conformation than a 2 Å crystal structure.Figure 4Cryo-EM reconstruction of the Trio1284-1959–Rac1 complex.

The HDX-MS map of Trio1284-1959 alone (Fig. S6) showed the anticipated exchange pattern for peptides derived from the DH and PH domains of the GEF module (residues 1284–1594), with lower exchanging regions corresponding to those observed in crystal structures and surface residues and loops displaying higher exchange. Following the GEF module, the only peptides showing any solvent protection are those roughly corresponding to the SH3N domain. The linker region we showed to confer activation (residues 1719–1959) are likely disordered because they all exchange within 10 s after the start of the experiment. The corresponding map for Rac1·GDP (Fig. S8A) was consistent with crystal structures of the molecule. In HDX-MS difference maps comparing Trio1284-1959 and Rac1·GDP alone to the Trio1284-1959–Rac1 complex (Figs. 5, 6 and S6–S8), the overall HDX profile is as one might expect from the structure of the TrioN–Rac1 complex. Residues from each protein that form the interface exhibited a decrease in exchange in the complex consistent with their sequestration from solvent, including Trio1284-1959 residues in α1, α3, α4, α5, and most strongly"

Traditional lithology identification usually relies on manual visual inspection, which is time-consuming and professionally demanding. In recent years, the rapid development of convolutional neural networks has provided an innovative way for the automatic prediction of drill core images. In this work, a core dataset containing a total of 10 common lithology categories in underground engineering was constructed. ResNeSt-50 we adopted uses a strategy of combining channel-wise attention and multi-path network to achieve cross-channel feature correlations, which significantly improves the model accuracy without high model complexity. Transfer learning was used to initialize the model parameters, to extract the feature of core images more efficiently. The model achieved superior performance on testing images compared with other discussed CNN models, the average value of its Precision, Recall, F1-score for each category of lithology is 99.62%, 99.62%, and 99.59%, respectively, and the prediction accuracy is 99.60%. The test results show that the proposed method is optimal and effective for automatic lithology classification of borehole cores."

Core samples contained crustaceans (Orders Amphipoda and Calanoida), blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), coquina clams (Donax variabilis), and miscellaneous prey (horseshoe crab eggs (Limulus polyphemus), angel wing clams (Cyrtopleura costata), and other organisms (e.g., insect larvae, snails, worms)). Estimated red knot peak counts in Virginia during 21-27 May were highest in 2012 (11,959) and lowest in 2014 (2,857; 12-year peak migration [Formula: see text] = 7,175, SD = 2,869). Red knot and prey numbers varied across sampling periods and substrates (i.e., peat and sand). Red knots generally used sites with more prey. Miscellaneous prey ([Formula: see text] = 2401.00/m2, SE = 169.16) influenced red knot presence at a site early in migration, when we only sampled on peat banks. Coquina clams ([Formula: see text] = 1383.54/m2, SE = 125.32) and blue mussels ([Formula: see text] = 777.91/m2, SE = 259.31) affected red knot presence at a site during peak migration, when we sampled both substrates. Few relationships between prey and red knot flock size existed, suggesting that other unmeasured factors determined red knot numbers at occupied sites. Tide and mean daily water temperature affected prey abundance. Maximizing the diversity, availability, and abundance of prey for red knots on barrier islands requires management that encourages the presence of both sand and peat bank intertidal habitats."
https://openalex.org/W4283766096,"Cortico-muscular interactions play important role in sensorimotor control during motor task and are commonly studied by cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) method using joint electroencephalogram-surface electromyogram (EEG-sEMG) signals. As noise and time delay between the two signals weaken the CMC value, coupling difference between non-task sEMG channels is often undetectable. We used sparse representation of EEG channels to compute CMC and detect coupling for task-related and non-task sEMG signals. High-density joint EEG-sEMG (53 EEG channels, 4 sEMG bipolar channels) signals were acquired from 15 subjects (30.26 ± 4.96 years) during four specific hand and foot contraction tasks (2 dynamic and 2 static contraction). Sparse representations method was applied to detect projection of EEG signals on each sEMG channel. Bayesian optimization was employed to select best-fitted method with tuned hyperparameters on the input feeding data while using 80% data as the train set and 20% as test set. K-fold (K = 5) cross-validation method was used for evaluation of trained model. Two models were trained separately, one for CMC data and the other from sparse representation of EEG channels on each sEMG channel. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy criteria were obtained for test dataset to evaluate the performance of task-related and non-task sEMG channels detection. Coupling values were significantly different between grand average of task-related compared to the non-task sEMG channels (Z = -6.33, p< 0.001, task-related median = 2.011, non-task median = 0.112). Strong coupling index was found even in single trial analysis. Sparse representation approach (best fitted model: SVM, Accuracy = 88.12%, Sensitivity = 83.85%, Specificity = 92.45%) outperformed CMC method (best fitted model: KNN, Accuracy = 50.83%, Sensitivity = 52.17%, Specificity = 49.47%). Sparse representation approach offers high performance to detect CMC for discerning the EMG channels involved in the contraction tasks and non-tasks."
https://openalex.org/W4283767161,"The decline in northern myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) populations due to the disease white-nose syndrome (WNS) has led to the species receiving federal protection in the United States and Canada, requiring conservation of critical habitats. However, considerably more is known about summer habitat preferences of northern myotis compared to late summer through winter. Our goal was to describe the seasonal presence and habitat use of a remnant colony of northern myotis in central Pennsylvania. We radio-tagged 31 northern myotis and established 6 acoustic monitoring stations to document activity from 2017-2021. We found that roost trees used during the maternity season by reproductive females were occupied by bats during both summer (21 June-14 August) and autumn (15 August-31 October), indicating similar habitat use patterns between seasons. During this time, both males and females preferred to roost in dead and declining trees. No other variable influenced male use, but females also preferred trees located close to water and in forest stands with higher basal area than randomly located trees. Northern myotis with active transmitters never left the study area and were tracked to roosts until early November. During October and November, a female and male were tracked to an underground network of air-filled voids (the Milieu Souterrain Superficiel) we presume to be a hibernaculum. Northern myotis calls were recorded outside this roost between March and October, and bats were observed emerging from this roost during spring and autumn but not summer. Acoustic activity at this site exhibited a seasonal pattern that differed from acoustic activity near roost trees and foraging areas, with a peak of activity during late summer when northern myotis are known to swarm. These data show that northern myotis maternity roosts are used extensively outside of summer and may be vulnerable to forestry practices that occur even outside of the pup-rearing season. These data also support the growing evidence that some northern myotis hibernate outside of caves and mines."
https://openalex.org/W4283767567,"As a major tea component, theabrownin represents a promising anti-cancer candidate. However, its effect on the melanoma is unknown. To evaluate the in vitro and in vivo anti-melanoma efficacy of TB, we conducted cell viability, immunostaining, comet, and TUNEL assays on human A375 melanoma cells, and employed a zebrafish xenograft model of A375 cells. Real-time PCR (qPCR) and western blot were conducted to explore the molecular mechanisms of TB. In vitro, TB significantly inhibited the proliferation of A375 cells, and A375 cells showed the highest inhibitory rate among the other melanoma cell line (A875) and human dermal fibroblasts. TB triggered DNA damage and induced apoptosis of A375 cells and significantly inhibited the growth of A375 xenograft tumors in zebrafishes. Several key molecular events were activated by TB, including DNA damage-associated p53 and NF-κB pathways, through up-regulation of GADD45α, γ-H2A.X, phospho-ATM(p-ATM), phospho-ATR (p-ATR), phospho-p53 (p-p53), phospho-IKKα/β (p-IKKα/β), phospho-p65 (p-p65), etc. However, the TB-activated molecular events were counteracted by either knockdown of p53 or p65, and only dual knockdown of both p53 and p65 completed counteracted the anti-melanoma efficacy of TB. In conclusion, TB triggered DNA damage and thereby inhibited proliferation and induced cellular senescence and apoptosis of melanoma cells through mechanisms mediated by p53/NF-κB signaling crosstalk. This is the first report on the efficacy and mechanisms of TB on melanoma cells, making TB a promising candidate for anti-melanoma agent development."

Using a nominally macrolide-resistant model Klebsiella pneumoniae strain (ATCC 10031) we demonstrate the effectiveness of several macrolides in inhibiting biofilm growth in multi-well plates, and the ability of azithromycin (AZM) to improve the effectiveness of the antibacterial last-agent-of-choice for K . pneumoniae infections, colistin methanesulfonate (CMS), against biofilms. This synergistic action was also seen in biofilm tests of several K . pneumoniae hospital isolates and could also be identified in polymyxin B disc-diffusion assays on azithromycin plates. Our work highlights the complexity of antimicrobial-resistance in bacterial pathogens and the need to test antibiotics with biofilm models where potential synergies might provide new therapeutic opportunities not seen in liquid culture or colony-based assays."
https://openalex.org/W4283772845,"Introduction Daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV-prevention is an essential component of national plans to end the HIV epidemic. Despite its well-documented safety and effectiveness, PrEP prescription has not met the public health need. Significant disparities between White and Black people exist with respect to PrEP prescription, as do disparities between men and women. One factor contributing to these disparities is clinicians’ assumptions about patients seeking PrEP. Methods The present study sought to investigate medical students’ assumptions about patients seeking PrEP (anticipated increased condomless sex, extra-relational sex, and adherence to PrEP), and assumed HIV risk when presenting with their sexual partner. We systematically varied the race (Black or White) and gender (man or woman) of a fictional patient and their sexual partner. All were in serodifferent relationships including men who have sex with men (MSM), women (MSW), and women who have sex with men (WSM). Participants also completed an implicit association test measuring implicit racism against Black people. We evaluated the moderation effects of patient and partner race on assumptions as well as the moderated moderation effects of implicit racism. Results A total of 1,472 students participated. For MSM patients, having a Black partner was associated with higher assumed patient non-adherence to PrEP compared to a White partner, however a White partner was associated with higher assumed HIV risk. For MSW patients, a White male patient was viewed as being more likely to engage in more extra-relational sex compared to a Black male patient. For WSM patients, White women were assumed to be more likely to have condomless and extra-relational sex, be nonadherent to PrEP, and were at higher HIV risk. Overall, implicit racism was not related to negative assumptions about Black patients as compared to White patients based on patient/partner race. Discussion Medical education about PrEP for HIV prevention must ensure future health professionals understand the full range of patients who are at risk for HIV, as well as how implicit racial biases may affect assumptions about patients in serodifferent couples seeking PrEP for HIV prevention. As gatekeepers for PrEP prescription, clinicians’ assumptions about patients seeking PrEP represent a barrier to access. Consistent with prior research, we identified minimal effects of race and implicit racism in an experimental setting."
https://openalex.org/W4283778684,"Ethiopia is a Sub-Saharan country with very high neonatal mortality rates, varying across its regions. The rate of neonatal mortality reduction in Ethiopia is slow, and Ethiopia may not meet the third United Nations sustainable development target by 2030. This study aimed to investigate the spatial variations and contributing factors for neonatal mortality rates in Ethiopia.We analysed data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS), which used a two-stage cluster sampling technique with a census enumeration area as primary and households as secondary sampling units. A Bayesian spatial logistic regression model using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) method was fitted accounting for socio-economic, health service-related and geographic factors.Higher neonatal mortality rates were observed in eastern, northeastern and southeastern Ethiopia, and the Somali region had higher risks of neonatal mortality. Neonates from frequently drought-affected areas had a higher mortality risk than less drought-affected areas. Application of traditional substances on the cord increased the risk of neonatal mortality (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.07, 95% Credible Interval (CrI): 1.12 to 4.30) and getting health facility delivery services had a lower odds of neonatal mortality (AOR = 0.60, 95% CrI: 0.37, 0.98).Residing in drought-affected areas, applying traditional substances on the umbilical cord and not delivering at health facilities were associated with a higher risk of neonatal mortality. Policy-makers and resource administrators at different administrative levels could leverage the findings to prioritise and target areas identified with higher neonatal mortality rates."
https://openalex.org/W4283779163,"Enzalutamide, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, significantly prolonged the survival of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, patients receiving enzalutamide frequently develop drug resistance. Rooibos ( Aspalathus linearis ) is a shrub-like leguminous fynbos plant endemic to the Cedarberg Mountains area in South Africa. We evaluated the possibility of using a pharmaceutical-grade green rooibos extract (GRT, containing 12.78% aspalathin) to suppress the proliferation and survival of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Treatment with GRT dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation, survival, and colony formation of enzalutamide-resistant C4-2 MDV3100r cells and PC-3 cells. Non-cancerous human cells were more resistant to GRT treatment. GRT suppressed the expression of proteins involved in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling, androgen receptor (AR), phospho-AR (Ser81), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), c-Myc and Bcl-2 but increased the expression of apoptotic proteins. Overexpression of c-Myc antagonized the suppressive effects of GRT, while knockdown of c-Myc increased the sensitivity of PCa cells to GRT treatment. Expression level of c-Myc correlated to resistance of PCa cells to GRT treatment. Additionally, immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that GRT reduced the abundance of AR proteins both in nucleus and cytoplasm. Treatment with cycloheximide revealed that GRT reduced the stability of AR. GRT suppressed protein expression of AR and AR’s downstream target prostate specific antigen (PSA) in C4-2 MDV3100r cells. Interestingly, we observed that AR proteins accumulate in nucleus and PSA expression is activated in the AR-positive enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells even in the absence of androgen. Our results suggested that GRT treatment suppressed the cell proliferation and survival of enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells via inhibition of c-Myc, induction of apoptosis, as well as the suppression of expression, signaling and stability of AR. GRT is a potential adjuvant therapeutic agent for enzalutamide-resistant PCa."
https://openalex.org/W4283750817,"Purpose Persistent symptoms of chronic otitis media cause limitations in daily routine and social interactions, influencing significantly patients’ quality of life and mental health. The purpose of the study was to assess the intensity depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in patients with chronic otitis media and to examine if patient demographic data, characteristics and reported symptoms of otitis influence reported depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. Material and methods The study included 316 adult patients diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma. Patients underwent a complete otological, audiological and radiological assessment. Chronic otitis media questionnaire 12 (COMQ-12) was used to assess the impact of COM and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21) was used for depression, anxiety and stress assessment. Results Some level of anxiety and stress were detected in 70.57% 49.37% of the patients, respectively. 13.29% of the patients had scores indicating depression disorder. The mean value of the COMQ-12 questionnaire for this group of patients was 26.24 (SD±11.47) More intense symptoms of COM were significantly associated (p&lt;0.05) with higher scores on DASS-21 subscales. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that significant positive predictors of higher anxiety scores were pure tone average (PTA) on better and worse hearing ear (p&lt;0.05). Drainage from the ear, hearing problems at home and tinnitus were significant positive predictors of a higher DASS-depression score. (p&lt;0.05) Conclusion The study confirmed positive correlation between reported level of anxiety, depression and stress, severity of COM symptoms and quality of life. Level of hearing on the better and worse hearing ear were significant positive predictors of anxiety and stress in patients with COM."
https://openalex.org/W4283756243,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are part of the most widespread fungal-plant symbiosis. They colonize at least 80% of plant species, promote plant growth and plant diversity. These fungi are multinucleated and contain either one or two haploid nuclear genotypes (monokaryon and dikaryon) identified by the alleles at a putative mating-type locus. This taxon has been considered as an ancient asexual scandal because of the lack of observable sexual structures. Despite identification of a putative mating-type locus and functional activation of genes related to mating when two isolates co-exist, it remains unknown if the AMF life cycle involves a sexual or parasexual stage. We used publicly available genome sequences to test if Rhizophagus irregularis dikaryon genomes display signatures of sexual reproduction in the form of reciprocal recombination patterns, or if they display exclusively signatures of parasexual reproduction involving gene conversion. We used short-read and long-read sequence data to identify nucleus-specific alleles within dikaryons and then compared them to orthologous gene sequences from related monokaryon isolates displaying the same putative MAT-types as the dikaryon. We observed that the two nucleus-specific alleles of the dikaryon A5 are more related to the homolog sequences of monokaryon isolates displaying the same putative MAT-type than between each other. We also observed that these nucleus-specific alleles displayed reciprocal recombination signatures. These results confirm that dikaryon and monokaryon isolates displaying the same putative MAT-type are related in their life-cycle. These results suggest that a genetic exchange mechanism, involving reciprocal recombination in dikaryon genomes, allows AMF to generate genetic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W4283758002,"Adiponectin, an adipokine, regulates glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity through the adiponectin receptor (AdipoR). In this study, we searched for metabolites that activate the adiponectin signaling pathway from tomato ( Solanum lycopersicu ). Metabolites of mature tomato were separated into 55 fractions by liquid chromatography, and then each fraction was examined using the phosphorylation assay of AMP-protein kinase (AMPK) in C2C12 myotubes and in AdipoR-knockdown cells by small interfering RNA (siRNA). Several fractions showed AMPK phosphorylation in C2C12 myotubes and siRNA-mediated abrogation of the effect. Non-targeted metabolite analysis revealed the presence of 721 diverse metabolites in tomato. By integrating the activity of fractions on AMPK phosphorylation and the 721 metabolites based on their retention times of liquid chromatography, we performed a comprehensive screen for metabolites that possess adiponectin-like activity. As the screening suggested that the active fractions contained four carotenoids, we further analyzed β-carotene and lycopene, the major carotenoids of food. They induced AMPK phosphorylation via the AdipoR, Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase and Ca 2+ influx, in addition to activating glucose uptake via AdipoR in C2C12 myotubes. All these events were characteristic adiponectin actions. These results indicated that the food-derived carotenoids, β-carotene and lycopene, activate the adiponectin signaling pathway, including AMPK phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W4283758799,"Background In Lao PDR, dengue fever is the most important vector borne disease and vector control remains the principal method to fight against Aedes aegypti the primary transmitter mosquito species. Vector control management programs need new strategies in addition to conventional larviciding and adulticiding interventions in the country. In this study, we examined the In2Care® Mosquito Trap’s efficacy using insecticide auto-dissemination strategy. The insecticide pyriproxyfen, present in powder form inside the trap station, contaminates the body of gravid female mosquitoes visiting the traps and is later on disseminated via the mosquitoes in breeding sites surrounding the traps. We tested the attractiveness of the Traps, their efficacy to reduce the larval and adult abundance, and the impact on emergence rates. Specifically, we tested if the servicing interval of the In2Care® Mosquito Trap could be extended to 12 weeks. Methods Two black plastic ovitrap buckets and two BG® sentinel traps were placed in the premises of the Science campus of Vientiane Capital located in an urban area to measure weekly the larval and adult relative abundance of Aedes mosquitoes from 2017 to 2019. Twenty-five In2Care® Mosquito Traps were evenly distributed in this area and two studies of 12 weeks were implemented during January and April 2018 and, July to October 2018 (dry and rainy season, respectively). Every 2 weeks, water samples from 5 In2Care® Traps were randomly selected and tested at the laboratory with Ae . aegypti larvae to measure the larval and pupal mortality. The relative abundance of Aedes mosquitoes in the BG traps® with the presence of In2Care® Traps in 2018, was compared with the surveillance results obtained in 2017 and 2019 without In2Care® Traps. Every week, water samples from the ovitrap buckets were tested for Emergence Inhibition (EI). Results The In2Care® Traps were very attractive to gravid Ae . aegypti mosquitoes specifically during the rainy seasons with 96% of the traps colonized with larvae/pupae within four weeks. The bioassays showed 100% mortality in the water samples from the traps during the twelve weeks studies showing the good efficacy over time of the pyriproxyfen without additional servicing in the 12 week period. In addition, the larvicide was successfully disseminated into the ovitrap buckets placed in the treated area where 100% of EI during all weeks of intervention was measured. There was no significant effect of the treatment on adult abundance reduction in the treated area, probably due to recolonization of adult mosquitoes surrounding the field experiment. Conclusions The observed potential of the In2Care® Mosquito Trap using the auto-dissemination strategy could lead to the use of this new tool in combination with conventional control methods against Dengue vectors in urban tropical areas. Large scale field trials should be implemented in Lao PDR to prove its efficacy for Public Health programs."

The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between race/ethnicity and extramural research proposal and award rates across a medical school faculty and to determine whether there was evidence that researchers changed their submission strategies because of differential inequities across submission categories.The authors performed an analysis of 14,263 biomedical research proposals with proposed start dates between 2010-2022 from the University of Michigan Medical School, measuring the proposal submission and award rates for each racial/ethnic group across 4 possible submission categories (R01 & Equivalent programs, other federal, industry, and non-profit).Researchers from each self-identified racial/ethnic group (Asian, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino) pursued a different proposal submission strategy than the majority group (White). The authors found that Black/African American researchers experienced negative award rate differentials across all submission categories, which resulted in the lowest R01 & Equivalent and Other Federal submission rates of any racial/ethnic group and the highest submission rate to non-profit sources. The authors did not find support for the hypothesis that researchers changed submission strategies in response to award rate inequalities across submission categories.Biomedical researchers from different racial/ethnic groups follow markedly different proposal submission strategies within the University of Michigan Medical School. There is also a clear relationship between race/ethnicity and rates of proposal award. Black/African American and Asian researchers appear disadvantaged across all submission categories relative to White researchers. This study can be easily replicated by other academic research institutions, revealing opportunities for positive intervention."

The spectral characteristics of excitation (absorption) in the range of 180-700 nm of healthy and infected seeds of wheat, barley and oats were measured. The greatest difference in the excitation spectra of healthy and infected seeds was observed in the short-wave range of 220-450 nm. At the same time, the excitation characteristics of infected seeds were higher than those of healthy ones, and the integral parameter Η in the entire range was 10-56% higher. A new maximum appeared at the wavelength of 232 nm and the maximum value increased by 362 nm. The spectral characteristics were measured when excited by radiation at wavelengths of 232, 362, 424, 485, 528 nm and the luminescence fluxes were calculated. It is established that the photoluminescence fluxes Φ in the short-wave ranges of 290-380 nm increase by 1.58-3.14 times and 390-550 nm-by 1.44-2.54 times. The fluxes in longer wavelength ranges do not change systematically and less significantly: for wheat, they decrease by 12% and increase by 19%, for barley, they decrease by 10% and increase by 33%. The flux decreases by 43-71% for oats. Based on the results obtained for cereal seeds, it is possible to further develop a method for detecting fusarium infection with absolute measurements of photoluminescence fluxes in the range of 290-380 nm, or when measuring photoluminescence ratios: for wheat seeds when excited with wavelengths of 424 nm and 232 nm (Φ424/Φ232); for barley seeds-when excited with wavelengths of 485 nm and 232 nm (Φ485/Φ232) and for oat seeds-when excited with wavelengths of 424 nm and 362 nm (Φ424/Φ362)."

However, previous research ignores the performance and competency of bid evaluation experts, so this paper aims to provide a theoretical basis for incentive and constraint mechanism and hierarchical or dynamic management of bid evaluation experts by implementing performance and dynamic competency evaluation of bid evaluation experts.Firstly, the evaluation index system of performance and dynamic competency of bid evaluation experts is preliminarily constructed by referring to relevant literature, and then the constructed evaluation index was modified and improved by consulting relevant stakeholders' experts. Secondly, considering the hesitation and consistency of expert weighting, the calculation method of expert weight coefficient and index score interval number is improved. Based on the theory of weight interval number, the corresponding mathematical optimization model is constructed to calculate the index weight according to the purpose of performance judgment and dynamic competency clustering of bid evaluation experts. Finally, the data of performance and dynamic competency of bid evaluation experts is obtained by questionnaire survey, and the empirical analysis was carried out by simulating the bid evaluation experts consistent with the actual situation.After improving the calculation method of index score interval number, and then calculating index weight interval number through index score interval number, the length of index weight interval number can be decreased and the calculation accuracy of index weight interval number can be increased. In addition, the index weight calculated by the constructed mathematical optimization model can make the intra-class discrimination smaller and the inter-class discrimination larger.

LPUE indices were used as a response variable in linear models where year (2012-2016), season, region (north and south) and NAO index were explanatory variables. Seasonal and regional effects were found to significantly affect species abundance for a total of 41 and 40 species respectively, while year trends were found to be significant for 19 species, and the NAO index for 3 species. LPUE density maps are presented for several selected species and a subsample of trips, where VMS records were available. It is proposed that geographic and seasonal changes in LPUE can be used to understand trends in abundance and obtain information that can be used in support regional management plans."
https://openalex.org/W4283782708,"Tetramethrin (Tm) is a commonly used pesticide that has been reported to exert estrogen-antagonistic effects selectively on female rats. The present study was undertaken to assess the protective role of lobaric acid (La) on estrous cycle in Tm-treated female Wistar rats. Female rats were exposed to Tm (50 mg/kg b.w/day) only or in combination with La at low (50 mg/kg b.w/day) or high (100 mg/kg b.w/day) dose for 30 days. The results showed that Tm altered the estrous cycle of female rats by decreasing the levels of luteinizing hormone, follicular-stimulating hormone, progesterone, estrone, and estradiol while increasing testosterone level. The morphology of vaginal smears of Tm-treated female rats showed the presence of abnormal cells and/or structures at different phases of estrus cycle. Strikingly, in (Tm + La)-treated rats, all the observed adverse effects of Tm on the hormonal parameters, cell morphology, and the length of each phase of estrous cycle were significantly diminished in a dose-dependent manner. The docking results showed that La competes with Tm for Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) receptor, thereby reducing the toxicity of Tm but did not cancel the response of GnRH receptor completely. In conclusion, our results designated that La could be used as a potential candidate in the management of insecticide-induced alterations of the reproductive cycle of rodents."
https://openalex.org/W4283732610,"Uncontrolled resection of replication forks under stress can cause genomic instability and influence cancer formation. Extensive fork resection has also been implicated in the chemosensitivity of ""BReast CAncer gene"" BRCA-deficient cancers. However, how fork resection is controlled in different genetic contexts and how it affects chromosomal stability and cell survival remains incompletely understood. Here, we report a novel function of the transcription repressor ZKSCAN3 in fork protection and chromosomal stability maintenance under replication stress. We show disruption of ZKSCAN3 function causes excessive resection of replication forks by the exonuclease Exo1 and homologous DNA recombination/repair protein Mre11 following fork reversal. Interestingly, in BRCA1-deficient cells, we found ZKSCAN3 actually promotes fork resection upon replication stress. We demonstrate these anti- and pro-resection roles of ZKSCAN3, consisting of a SCAN box, Kruppel-associated box, and zinc finger domain, are mediated by its SCAN box domain and do not require the Kruppel-associated box or zinc finger domains, suggesting that the transcriptional function of ZKSCAN3 is not involved. Furthermore, despite the severe impact on fork structure and chromosomal stability, depletion of ZKSCAN3 did not affect the short-term survival of BRCA1-proficient or BRCA1-deficient cells after treatment with cancer drugs hydroxyurea, PARPi, or cisplatin. Our findings reveal a unique relationship between ZKSCAN3 and BRCA1 in fork protection and add to our understanding of the relationships between replication fork protection, chromosomal instability, and chemosensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W4283742886,"Background and aims The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of FibroTouch and serological models on staging hepatic fibrosis in chronic liver diseases. Methods We recruited 850 patients undergoing liver biopsy and received FibroTouch test before or after liver biopsy within one week, blood was taken for the routine inspection before the operation within one week. The serological models were calculated by the blood results and routine clinical information. The diagnostic value of FibroTouch and six serological models was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Results Patients with severe liver fibrosis had significantly higher AST, ALT, GGT, RDW, ALP, and FT-LSM. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of FT-LSM for the liver diagnosis of S≥2, S≥3 and S = 4 was 0.75(95% confidence interval [CI]:0.72–0.78), 0.83(95% CI: 0.80–0.86), and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81–0.89), respectively. The optimal cut-off of FT-LSM for diagnosing S≥2, S≥3 and S = 4 was 8.7, 10.7, and 12.3, respectively. Conclusions Our study showed the FibroTouch has a higher diagnostic value compared with the non-invasive serological models in staging the fibrosis stage. The cut-off of FibroTouch and five serological models (APRI, FIB-4, S-index, Forns, and PRP) increased with the severe of fibrosis stage."

The present study characterized and compared gene expression profiles in abdominal fat from broiler chickens of different FE levels to enhance the understanding of FE biology. Specifically, traditional whole-transcript RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and 3' UTR-sequencing (3' UTR-seq) were applied to 22 and 61 samples, respectively. Overall, these two sequencing techniques shared a high correlation (0.76) between normalized counts, although 3' UTR-seq showed a higher variance in sequencing and mapping performance statistics across samples and a lower rate of uniquely mapped reads. A higher percentage of 3' UTR-seq reads mapped to introns suggested the frequent presence of cleavage sites in introns, thus warranting future research to study its regulatory function. Differential expression analysis identified 1198 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high FE (HFE) and intermediate FE (IFE) chickens with False Discovery Rate < 0.05 and fold change > 1.2. The processes that were significantly enriched by the DEGs included extracellular matrix remodeling and mechanisms impacting gene expression at the transcriptional and translational levels. Gene ontology enrichment analysis suggested that the divergence in fat deposition and FE in broiler chickens could be associated with peroxisome and lipid metabolism possibly regulated by G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2)."
https://openalex.org/W4283752178,"Snow pea is a very important vegetable, and its postharvest storage characteristics vary with species. Few studies on the differences in its storage characteristics are available. In this study, postharvest changes in metabolic rate (respiration rate and water loss rate), membrane permeability (relative conductivity), nutrient contents (total sugar, amino acids, starch), lignin, cellulose, β-Glucosidase (β-GC) enzyme activity, texture properties, PG enzyme activity and their relationship were analyzed in large sweet broad peas and small snow peas. On the 8th day of storage, we found that the respiration rate and water loss rate were increased, total sugars and total amino acids were decreased significantly in these two legume vegetables, and that metabolic rate was slower with less nutrients consumed in large sweet broad peas than in small snow peas. Throughout the 8-day whole storage, the lignin and cellulose contents were always lower in large sweet broad peas than in small snow peas. With the increasing storage time, small snow peas were more susceptible to lignification and fibrosis, which was observed in their texture properties. The enzyme activities related to cellulose and pectin degradation (β-GC, PG) also showed the same trend during the storage. At the late stage of storage, the taste of large sweet broad peas was better than that of small snow peas. In conclusion, the storage period of large sweet broad peas was longer than that of the small snow peas, and its lignification degree was lower than that of the small snow peas. Meanwhile, senescence and lignin accumulation led to hardening of snow pea during postharvest storage. Our findings provide a theoretical reference for improving the postharvest storage quality of snow pea and extending the shelf life."

https://openalex.org/W4283763083,"The high-sensitivity cardiac troponin on presentation to rule out myocardial infarction (HiSTORIC) study was a stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial with long before-and-after periods, involving seven hospitals across Scotland. Results were divergent for the binary safety endpoint (type 1 or type 4b myocardial infarction or cardiac death) across certain pre-specified analyses, which warranted further investigation. In particular, the calendar-matched analysis produced an odds ratio in the opposite direction to the primary logistic mixed-effects model analysis.Several post-hoc statistical models were fitted to each of the co-primary outcomes of length of hospital stay and safety events, which included adjusting for exposure time, incorporating splines, and fitting a random time effect. We improved control of patient characteristics over time by adjusting for multiple additional covariates using different methods: direct inclusion, regression adjustment for propensity score, and weighting. A data augmentation approach was also conducted aiming to reduce the effect of sparse data bias. Finally, the raw data was examined.The new statistical models confirmed the results of the pre-specified trial analysis. In particular, the observed divergence between the calendar-matched and other analyses remained, even after performing the covariate adjustment methods, and after using data augmentation. Divergence was particularly acute for the safety endpoint, which had an event rate of 0.36% overall. Examining the raw data was particularly helpful to assess the sensitivity of the results to small changes in event rates and identify patterns in the data.Our experience reveals the importance of conducting multiple pre-specified sensitivity analyses and examining the raw data, particularly for stepped wedge trials with low event rates or with a small number of sites. Before-and-after analytical approaches that adjust for differences in patient populations but avoid direct modelling of the time trend should be considered in future stepped wedge trials with similar designs."
https://openalex.org/W4283764309,"This study proposes the notion of ""root concepts"" in cultural production, defined as a novel style and mode that a creator expresses at the initial field development phase, and that has a great influence on subsequent creators. We explore the role of root concepts in cultural evolution by focusing on their capacity to generate new combinations with other elements and examine how creators use root concepts jointly with other elements. Using data on artists and albums in the rap genre from the online database Allmusic, we view music moods as a type of experience that music generates and focus on music moods as a phenotype in studying styles and modes. We constructed a dataset of recombinatory patterns in the subsequent cultural production and identified two types of root concepts: implosive concepts, which artists use jointly with similar elements; and explosive concepts, which artists use in conjunction with highly diversified elements. Implosive concepts are exclusive because they require creators to have network contagions with those familiar with the root concepts and have strong and specific socio-economic identities. Previous research has suggested that finding a new combination is challenging owing to creators' limited cognitive capacities and the resulting local search. Our finding presents an alternative explanation: some root concepts (i.e., implosive ones) possess innate characteristics that limit creators from experimentally integrating diversified elements. This study develops new opportunities for future research on the evolutionary growth of cultural production and knowledge fields."
https://openalex.org/W4283765522,"Analyses of electronic medical databases often compare clinical practice to guideline recommendations. These analyses have a limited ability to simultaneously evaluate many interconnected medical decisions. We aimed to overcome this limitation with an alternative method and apply it to the diagnostic workup of HIV, where misuse can contribute to HIV transmission, delay care, and incur unnecessary costs.We used graph theory to assess patterns of HIV diagnostic testing in a national healthcare system. We modeled the HIV diagnostic testing guidelines as a directed graph. Each node in the graph represented a test, and the edges pointed from one test to the next in chronological order. We then graphed each patient's HIV testing. This set of patient-level graphs was aggregated into a single graph. Finally, we compared the two graphs, the first representing the recommended approach to HIV diagnostic testing and the second representing the observed patterns of HIV testing, to assess for clinical practice deviations.The HIV diagnostic testing of 1.643 million patients provided 8.790 million HIV diagnostic test results for analysis. Significant deviations from recommended practice were found including the use of HIV resistance tests (n = 3,007) and HIV nucleic acid tests (n = 16,567) instead of the recommended HIV screen.We developed a method that modeled a complex medical scenario as a directed graph. When applied to HIV diagnostic testing, we identified deviations in clinical practice from guideline recommendations. The model enabled the identification of intervention targets and prompted systemwide policy changes to enhance HIV detection."
https://openalex.org/W4283770567,"We previously identified a subtype of schizophrenia (SCZ) characterized by increased plasma pentosidine, a marker of glycation and oxidative stress (PEN-SCZ). However, the genetic factors associated with PEN-SCZ have not been fully clarified. We performed a genome-wide copy number variation (CNV) analysis to identify CNVs associated with PEN-SCZ to provide an insight into the novel therapeutic targets for PEN-SCZ. Plasma pentosidine was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in 185 patients with SCZ harboring rare CNVs detected by array comparative genomic hybridization. In three patients with PEN-SCZ showing additional autistic features, we detected a novel deletion at 7q31.1 within exons 2 and 3 of IMMP2L, which encodes the inner mitochondrial membrane peptidase subunit 2. The deletion was neither observed in non-PEN-SCZ nor in public database of control subjects. IMMP2L is one of the SCZ risk loci genes identified in a previous SCZ genome-wide association study, and its trans-populational association was recently described. Interestingly, deletions in IMMP2L have been previously linked with autism spectrum disorder. Disrupted IMMP2L function has been shown to cause glycation/oxidative stress in neuronal cells in an age-dependent manner. To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide CNV study to suggest the involvement of IMMP2L exons 2 and 3 in the etiology of PEN-SCZ. The combination of genomic information with plasma pentosidine levels may contribute to the classification of biological SCZ subtypes that show additional autistic features. Modifying IMMP2L functions may be useful for treating PEN-SCZ if the underlying biological mechanism can be clarified in further studies."
https://openalex.org/W4283779239,"This research proposes the idea of double encryption, which is the combination of chaos synchronization of non-identical multi-fractional-order neural networks with multi-time-delays (FONNSMD) and symmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption is well known to be outstanding in speed and accuracy but less effective. Therefore, to increase the strength of data protection effectively, we combine both methods where the secret keys are generated from the third part of the neural network systems (NNS) and used only once to encrypt and decrypt the message. In addition, a fractional-order Lyapunov direct function (FOLDF) is designed and implemented in sliding mode control systems (SMCS) to maintain the convergence of approximated synchronization errors. Finally, three examples are carried out to confirm the theoretical analysis and find which synchronization is achieved. Then the result is combined with symmetric encryption to increase the security of secure communication, and a numerical simulation verifies the method’s accuracy."
