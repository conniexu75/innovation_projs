https://openalex.org/W4308077709,"Forest colors are important elements for public enjoying the scenery. So increasing attention has been acquired on forest color cognition. However researches on relationship between forest colors and public response are still insufficient, which cannot provide sufficient theoretical basis for the regulation of forest landscape in color. Therefore, We seek to examine the relationship between forest color and visual behavior based on eye tracking technology, and further interpret the visual indicators through the value of scenic beauty. This study researched Jiaozi Mountain in China by selecting 29 sampling points, counting up 116 photographs in 4 seasons by a mountainous region. On this basis, Matlab was performed to quantitatively extract color elements, while ArcGIS and Fragstats were applied to extract the spatial index of color patches. A total of 10 indicators were obtained to explain the color characteristics of each forest image. Through both visual behavior experiment and landscape preference evaluation, the results showed that people tend to have different visual behaviors and preference cognition when observing forest colors of different seasonal types. Based on the study of forest landscape color in all seasons, the subjects tend to judge the image in comparison to other seasonal forest landscape color photos to identify it more easily. For a single-season forest colors, diversified color information and abundant visual attention are important factors influencing the correlation between visual behavior, landscape preference, and forest color characteristics. This study aims to further reveal people’s perceptions and psychological preference to forest colors, contribute to the establishment of a more quantitative and scientific scenery evaluation system, and provide a scientific basis for forest color planning and design."

Mass spectral analysis of the peptide, oxidized by solvent assisted region-specific disulfide formation, confirmed that the correct folding and disulfide pairing could be facilitated using two different oxidative structure-promoting solvent systems. Residue specific analysis by isotope enhanced FTIR indicated that the N-terminal and C-terminal domains have well defined α-helical amino acid sequences. Using these experimentally derived measures of distance constraints and disulfide connectivity, the ensemble was further refined with molecular dynamics to provide a medium resolution, residue-specific structure for the peptide construct in a simulated synthetic lung surfactant lipid multilayer environment. The disulfide connectivity combined with the α-helical elements stabilize the peptide conformationally to form a helical hairpin structure that resembles critical elements of the Saposin protein fold of the predicted full-length Surfactant Protein B structure."
https://openalex.org/W4308067586,"Muscle mass is an important factor for surviving an illness. Ultrasound has gained increased attention as a muscle mass assessment method because of its noninvasiveness and portability. However, data on the frequency of ultrasound-based muscle mass assessment are limited, and there are some barriers to its implementation. Hence, a web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted on healthcare providers in Japan, which comprised four parts: 1) participant characteristics; 2) general muscle mass assessment; 3) ultrasound-based muscle mass assessment; and 4) the necessity of, interest in, and barriers to its implementation. Necessity and interest were assessed using an 11-point Likert scale, whereas barriers were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale, in which ""Strongly agree"" and ""Agree"" were counted for the analysis. Of the 1,058 responders, 1,026 participants, comprising 282 physicians, 489 physical therapists, 84 occupational therapists, 120 nurses, and 51 dieticians, were included in the analysis. In total, 93% of the participants were familiar with general muscle mass assessment, and 64% had conducted it. Ultrasound-based muscle mass assessment was performed by 21% of the participants. Necessity and interest scored 7 (6-8) and 8 (7-10), respectively for ultrasound-based muscle mass assessment. The barriers to its implementation included lack of relevant education (84%), limited staff (61%), and absence of fixed protocol (61%). Regardless of the necessity of and interest in ultrasound-based muscle mass assessment, it was only conducted by one-fifth of the healthcare providers, and the most important barrier to its implementation was lack of education."
https://openalex.org/W4308067706,"Renal cachexia is an important consideration in the person-centred care that is needed in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, given that clinical guidelines relating to renal cachexia are largely absent, this is an unmet care need. To inform guidelines and future renal service planning, there is an urgency to understand individuals' experiences of renal cachexia and the interrelated experiences of the carers in their lives. We report here the protocol for an interpretative phenomenological study which will explore this lived experience. A purposive sampling strategy will recruit individuals living with ESRD who have cachexia and their carers. A maximum of 30 participants (15 per group) dependent on saturation will be recruited across two nephrology directorates, within two healthcare trusts in the United Kingdom. Individuals with renal cachexia undergoing haemodialysis will be recruited via clinical gatekeepers and their carers will subsequently be invited to participate in the study. Participants will be offered the opportunity to have a face-to-face, virtual or telephone interview. Interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. NVivo, will be used for data management. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Office for Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland (REC Reference: 22/NI/0107). Scientific evidence tends to focus on measurable psychological, social and quality of life outcomes but there is limited research providing in-depth meaning and understanding of the views of individuals with renal disease who are experiencing renal cachexia. This information is urgently needed to better prepare healthcare providers and in turn support individuals with ESRD and their carers. This study will help healthcare providers understand what challenges individuals with ESRD, and their carers face in relation to cachexia and aims to inform future clinical practice guidelines and develop supportive interventions which recognise and respond to the needs of this population."
https://openalex.org/W4308077228,"Formal education is crucial for the development of nurses' professional identity and can play a decisive role in attracting students to the nursing profession. This is even more important during a public health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate nursing students' attitudes and feelings toward their future profession and academic studies during the first COVID-19 lockdown. A cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted on 361 nursing students. The data were collected through the Students' attitudes toward the nursing profession during the COVID-19 outbreak scale, and the Satisfaction with online learning scale. Nursing students expressed higher levels of commitment and dedication to their profession compared to perceived job security. They were generally satisfied with their distance learning experience in terms of accessibility of study materials, adaptation of lectures and quality of communication with academic staff. However, students perceived the ICT-supported distance learning as moderately effective. Students' satisfaction with online learning was positively related to their perceived professional commitment. In times of health crisis, faculties should consider students' perceived quality of nursing education and attitudes toward future profession to promote appropriate professional identity."
https://openalex.org/W4308077287,"Sudden shifts towards online education since the outbreak of Covid-19 propelled the unprepared changes in teaching and learning over the world. The impact of transferring Interpreter training from face-to-face instruction and practices to a fully online environment was viewed differently. Issues such as relatively inferior engagement in learning and dissatisfied performance in competence building were highlighted and compounded by the concern of academic burnout and learning stress caused by the abiding pandemic. To curb the unsatisfactory situation, alternative learning methods and innovative pedagogical approaches were advocated. The present study was a pioneering effort to integrate informal learning into remote interpreter training by developing and implementing an online informal learning communities for undergraduate interpreting trainees in a Chinese university. The researcher recruited 36 students (n = 36) from the institution as participants in the 1.5-year piloting project. The findings of the research revealed the impact of informal learning in supplementing formal education by engaging involved students. Student-centered learning supported by collaborative and experiential activities in an informal environment was well-received for its ability to galvanize student's engagement and academic achievements. The perceptions from participants revealed preference and expectation from students for expanded roles of trainers in interpreter training."
https://openalex.org/W4308077438,"Analyzing texts and items regarding their linguistic features might be important for researchers to investigate the effects of the linguistic presentation as well as for practitioners to estimate the readability of a text or an item. The Linguistic Analyzer for Text and Item Characteristics (LATIC) is a software that enables users to analyze texts and items more efficiently. LATIC offers a multitude of features at three different reading levels and can be used for texts and items in four different languages: English, French, German, and Spanish. It is open source, free to use and designed to be user-friendly. In this study, we investigated LATIC’s performance: LATIC achieves highly accurate results, while being extremely time saving compared to human raters. While developing LATIC, the respective features are tested continuously to ensure a high accuracy of results in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4308077591,"Introduction Research suggests that patients who are prisoners experience greater morbidity, increased health inequalities and frequent preventable harm, compared to the general population. Little is known about the process and influencing factors for safe prescribing in the unique prison environment, which may limit the development efforts to improve the quality of care in prisons. This study aimed to understand the process and challenges associated with prescribing in prisons, explore the causes and impact of these challenges, and explore approaches to improve prescribing safety in prisons. Methods Grounded theory informed data collection and analysis of a nominal group discussion by seven participants and semi-structured telephone interviews with twenty prison healthcare staff, including GPs, pharmacists, psychiatrists and nurses. Findings The underlying complexity of prescribing in prison settings increased the level of challenge and influenced the safety of this process. Multiple contributors to the challenges of safe prescribing were identified (comprising governance and policy; the prison structure; staff retention, training and skill mix; IT systems and interface; polypharmacy and co-morbidity; tradability and patient behaviour) with overarching constructs of variations in practice/policy and the influence of prison culture. Participants identified measures to address these challenges through multi-disciplinary collaborative working, increased consistency in processes, and the need for more innovation and education/training. Conclusions Our study highlighted that healthcare provision in prisons is unique and needs to tailor the care provided to patients without enforcing a model focused on primary, secondary or tertiary care. Participants emphasised a necessary shift in workplace culture and behaviour change to support improvements. The COM-B model of behaviour change may be effectively applied to develop interventions in organisations that have in-depth understanding of their own unique challenges."
https://openalex.org/W4308077667,"To conduct a cost-benefit analysis of AcrySof IQ PanOptix trifocal intraocular lens (TFNT00 IOL) versus AcrySof monofocal IOL (SN60AT) from the patient perspective in the United States (US).A de novo Markov model was developed to estimate the mean total lifetime patient costs and vision-related quality of life (measured as quality adjusted life-years (QALYs)) with each intervention (TFNT00 and SN60AT) and the incremental differences between these two treatments. The resulting incremental quality of life gain was mapped to the US patient willingness to pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gain to estimate the lifetime net monetary value, measured as the net monetary benefit of TFNT00 IOL. Model inputs (transition probabilities, costs, discount rate, utilities, and event rates) were derived from the FDA IDE study (NCT03280108), published literature, clinical experience, and other relevant sources.Bilateral cataract surgery with implantation of the advanced technology IOL (AT-IOL) TFNT00 provides improved vision-related quality of life (QALY gain of 0.67) at an incremental lifetime cost of $2,783 compared to monofocal IOL. This incremental QALY gain translated into a lifetime net monetary benefit of $30,941 at the patient willingness to pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gain. Results were most sensitive to disutility due to wearing glasses, patient out of pocket costs for bilateral AT-IOL procedure, and post-operative spectacle dependence rates.AcrySof IQ PanOptix IOL provides greater improvement in vision related quality of life compared to no presbyopia correction with a monofocal IOL. This study shows PanOptix is a cost-beneficial treatment strategy for patients willing to pay out of pocket for cataract surgery."
https://openalex.org/W4308077673,"The importance of online learning in higher education settings is growing, not only in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, metrics to evaluate and increase the quality of online instruction are crucial for improving student learning. Whereas instructional quality is traditionally evaluated with course observations or student evaluations, course syllabi offer a novel approach to predict course quality even prior to the first day of classes. This study develops an online course design characteristics rubric for science course syllabi. Utilizing content analysis, inductive coding, and deductive coding, we established four broad high-quality course design categories: course organization, course objectives and alignment, interpersonal interactions, and technology. Additionally, this study exploratively applied the rubric on 11 online course syllabi (N = 635 students) and found that these design categories explained variation in student performance."
https://openalex.org/W4308045215,"Wildfire burn severity has important implications for postfire vegetation recovery and boundary-layer climate. We used a collection of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets to investigate the impact of burn severity (relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio, RdNBR) on vegetation recovery (Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI), albedo change, and land surface temperature in seven California ecoregions, including: Southern California Mountains (SCM), Southern California Coast (SCC), Central California Foothills (CCF), Klamath (K), Cascades (C), Eastern Cascades (EC), and Sierra Nevada (SN). A statewide MODIS-derived RdNBR dataset was used to analyze the impact of burn severity on the five-year postfire early-summer averages of each biophysical variable between the years 2003-2020. We found that prefire EVI values were largest, and prefire albedo and temperature were lowest in the K, C, EC, and SN ecoregions. Furthermore, the largest changes between prefire and first-year postfire biophysical response tended to occur in the moderate and high burn severity classes across all ecoregions. First-year postfire albedo decreased in the K, C, EC, and SN but increased in the SCM, SCC, and CCF ecoregions. The greatest decreases, but most rapid recovery, of EVI occurred after high severity fires in all ecoregions. After five-years post-fire, EVI and land surface temperature did not return to prefire levels in any burn severity class in any ecoregion."
https://openalex.org/W4308067616,"Background Current diagnostics for patients with lingering symptoms categorized as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) have their limitations and may be difficult to interpret. The aim of this exploratory study was to evaluate the feasibility of protein biomarker profiling as a diagnostic platform for this category of patients and to compare these results with similarly obtained results from a group of patients with acute neuroborreliosis. Methods and findings Two groups of patient cohorts (Cohort 1 and 2) were analyzed for biomarkers in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); the results were used for group-level comparison. Cohort 1 comprised 158 adult patients selected from 224 previously diagnosed patients, who between October 2015 and December 2018, after referral, were enrolled and structurally investigated based on defined inclusion criteria. They displayed similar lingering symptoms, with a duration of at least 6 months, after presumed previous tick-borne infection (TBI) and are fully described in a previously published study originating from the Center for Vector-borne Infections (CVI), Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden. Cohort 2, comprised 30 patients diagnosed at Uppsala University Hospital between 2016 and 2019 with laboratory-confirmed acute neuroborreliosis. Their proteomic results, based on serum and CSF analyses, were compared with the 158 patients in Cohort 1. The expression and the concentration of potential biomarkers in each patient’s serum and CSF samples were measured based on two multiplex protein panels enabling simultaneous analysis of 92 inflammatory and neurology biomarkers. The PTLDS patient subgroup showed no nominally significant proteins compared to the other CVI patients in Cohort 1. However, CVI patients with signs of inflammation, which were evenly distributed in Cohort 1, showed 16 significantly (p &lt;0.05) different proteins in both CSF and serum, but no association was seen with laboratory-confirmed exposure to Borrelia spp or other TBIs. When comparing the two cohorts, different protein profiles were observed, with 125/148 significantly different proteins in CSF and 93/174 in serum, in patients with laboratory confirmed acute neuroborreliosis, of which 6 in CSF and 6 in serum were significant at the p &lt;0.001 level. Conclusions In this first comprehensive inflammatory and neurological biomarker profile study no differences in biomarker profiles were detected between patients with PTLDS and patients with similar persisting symptoms but who did not meet the PTLDS criteria, regardless of whether laboratory verified previous exposure to Borrelia or other TBI’s were present. However, the expressed markers differed from those found in patients with confirmed acute neuroborreliosis, which does not support the view that PTLDS reflects an ongoing Borrelia infection. Further studies are needed to understand and assess the usefulness of biosignatures of patients with PTLDS before they can be applied in a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W4308067618,"Entry-level health care professionals are socialized to accept the norms and values associated with institutions in which violence and suffering is considered an anticipated and even routine and normalized part of frontline care. The objective of the study was to illuminate the subjective experience of psychological trauma in graduates from a baccalaureate nursing and psychiatric nursing program using the McGill Illness Narrative Interview, an ethnographic interview guide. Participants included graduates from each program in a western Canadian province who reflected back on their experiences of trauma as students and newly-graduated nurses within their first year of practice as a regulated health professional. Results: Six key themes were identified. Witnessing sudden change in patient or client status and unexpected death; Emotional labour; Faculty incivility; Sabotage, bullying and verbal abuse from the health care team; Exposure to physical violence and sexual inappropriateness; and Mobilizing supports. All exposures were linked to the participants’ definition of psychological trauma. Conclusions: The study findings highlight the power dynamic, abuses, and vulnerability between students, faculty, and their clinical counterparts without adequate recourse. There is a need to foster emotional intelligence, self-efficacy, and resilience when potentially traumatic and stressful experiences occur with student nurse and early-career nursing populations."
https://openalex.org/W4308067674,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is currently one of the global public health threats. Increased antibiotic consumption in humans, animals, and agriculture has contributed directly to the spread of AMR. Upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) are one of the most common conditions treated by antibiotics, even if unnecessary as in cases of viral infections and self-limited conditions which represent the most cases of URIs. Investigating physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding antibiotic prescriptions in children with acute URIs may reflect the problem of antibiotic over prescription. This study aims to assess the problem in our community and provide information for further planning of appropriate interventions to optimize antibiotic prescriptions.This is a cross-sectional study for all non-specialized physicians dealing with acute upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) in pediatrics sittings in Assiut district, Egypt. We used a self-administered questionnaire to assess physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and practice. In addition, four clinical vignettes addressing different URI scenarios were included in the questionnaire to assess the patterns of antibiotic prescriptions in common cases.Our study included 153 physicians whose mean age was 32.2 ± 8.7, most of whom were pediatric residents in different health institutes in Assiut district. They had good knowledge as out of the 17 knowledge questions,the mean number of correct answers was 12.4 ± 2.9. Regarding their attitudes, mean attitude scores for inappropriate antibiotic prescribing were low. However, of those scores, the responsibility of others had the highest score (3.8 ± 0.61). Prescribing practice in special conditions of URIs showed that 80% of participants prescribed antibiotics if fever continued for more than five days and 61.4% if the child had a yellowish or greenish nasal discharge. Among 612 clinical vignettes, 326 contained antibiotic prescriptions (53.3%), and appropriate antibiotic prescriptions represented only 8.3% overall.Physicians dealing with acute URIs in outpatients' clinics in the Assiut district have good knowledge about antibiotic use and resistance and demonstrate a good attitude toward appropriate antibiotic use. Although the percentage of inappropriate prescriptions in clinical vignettes in high, more research is required to investigate the factors of antibiotic inappropriate prescribing practice and non-adherence to guidelines. Also, it is essential to set up a national antibiotic stewardship program to improve antibiotic prescribing and contain antimicrobial resistance problems."
https://openalex.org/W4308077218,"Introduction This study was aimed to investigate the effect of multimodal intervention on the cognitive functions of older adults with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI). Materials and methods Sixty subjects were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive either computer based cognitive therapy (CBCT) or CBCT+Mediterranean equivalent diet (MED) or CBCT+MED+ Exercise regime and the control group. The intervention group received supervised CBCT twice a week to have 40 sessions, each of 40 minutes duration, and/ or supervised aerobic and resistive exercise twice a week for 24 weeks and or MED at home under the supervision of a dietician. The control group was provided with health awareness instructions for brain stimulating activities such as sudoku, mental maths, and learning music and new skills. Results Cognitive functions which was the primary outcome measure were assessed using the Post Graduate Institute Memory Scale (PGI-MS), and Stroop Colour and Word Test at baseline and after 6 months intervention period. As assessed by the PGI-MS, there was significant improvement in domains such as mental balance, attention and concentration, delayed recall, immediate recall, verbal retention of dissimilar pairs, Visual retention, and total score both in the unimodal and multimodal intervention groups. However, the improvement was observed to be the highest in the multimodal intervention group as compared to unimodal group. All the participants completed the trial. Conclusion This pilot randomized control trial indicated that multimodal intervention could be an effective non-pharmacological intervention in individuals with SCI for improving their cognitive functions."
https://openalex.org/W4308077442,"Background Serologic testing for autoantibodies is recommended in interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), as connective tissue diseases (CTDs) are an important secondary cause. Myositis antibodies are associated with CTD-ILD, but clinical associations with other ILDs are unclear. In this study, associations of myositis antibodies in various ILDs were evaluated. Methods 1463 ILD patients and 116 healthy subjects were screened for myositis antibodies with a line-blot assay on serum available at time of diagnosis. Additionally, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf) was analysed. Results A total of 394 patients demonstrated reactivity to at least one antibody, including anti-Ro52 (36.0%), anti-Mi-2β (17.3%) and anti-Jo-1 (10.9%). Anti-Jo-1 (OR 6.4; p&lt;0.100) and anti-Ro52 (OR 6.0; p&lt;0.001) were associated with CTD-ILD. Interestingly, anti-Mi-2β was associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; OR 5.3; p = 0.001) and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP; OR 5.9; p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, anti-Mi-2β was strongly associated with a histological usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern (OR 6.5; p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, anti-Mi-2β reactivity was identified in BALf and correlated with serum anti-Mi-2β (r = 0.64; p = 0.002). No differences were found in survival rates between ILD patients with and without serum Mi-2β reactivity (hazard ratio 0.835; 95% CI 0.442–1.575; p = 0.577). Conclusion In conclusion, novel associations of antibody Mi-2β with fibrotic ILD were found. Furthermore, serum anti-Mi-2β was associated with a histological UIP pattern and presence of anti-Mi-2β in BALf. Possibly, anti-Mi-2β could be implemented as a future diagnostic biomarker for fibrotic ILD."
https://openalex.org/W4308077587,"Objectives Delirium is an important prognostic factor in postoperative patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery and intervention, including transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, delirium after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (DAT) is difficult to predict and its pathophysiology is still unclear. We aimed to investigate whether preoperative cerebral blood flow (CBF) is associated with DAT and, if so, whether CBF measurement is useful for predicting DAT. Methods We evaluated CBF in 50 consecutive patients before TAVI (84.7±4.5 yrs., 36 females) using 99m Tc ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography. Preoperative CBF of the DAT group (N = 12) was compared with that of the non-DAT group (N = 38) using whole brain voxel-wise analysis with SPM12 and region of interest-based analysis with the easy-Z score imaging system. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with the presence of DAT was used to create its prediction model. Results The whole brain analysis showed that preoperative CBF in the insula was lower in the DAT than in the non-DAT group (P&lt;0.05, family-wise error correction). Decrease extent ratio in the insula of the DAT group (17.6±11.5%) was also greater relative to that of the non-DAT group (7.0±11.3%) in the region of interest-based analysis (P = 0.007). A model that included preoperative CBF in the insula and conventional indicators (frailty index, short physical performance battery and mini-mental state examination) showed the best predictive power for DAT (AUC 0.882). Conclusions These results suggest that preoperative CBF in the insula is associated with DAT and may be useful for its prediction."
https://openalex.org/W4308077592,"Post COVID-19 condition can occur following infection with SARS-CoV-2 and is characterised by persistent symptoms, including fatigue, breathlessness and cognitive dysfunction, impacting everyday functioning. This study explored how people living with post COVID-19 experienced an eight-week inspiratory muscle training (IMT) rehabilitation programme. Individualised semi-structured interviews with 33 adults (29 female; 49 ± 10 years; 6–11 months post-infection) explored expectations of IMT prior to the intervention, and post intervention interviews explored perceptions of IMT and its impact on recovery. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. IMT helped many to feel proactive in managing their symptoms and was associated with perceived improvements in respiratory symptoms, exercise and work capacity, and daily functioning. IMT was well perceived and offers significant potential for use as part of a holistic recovery programme, although it is important to consider the complex, varied symptoms of post COVID-19, necessitating an individually tailored rehabilitation approach."
https://openalex.org/W4308077677,"The capture efficiency of six colored sticky traps (blue, green, orange, purple, white, and yellow) was tested in mango agroecosystems of Mexico with the purpose to: (i) document the diversity of Thysanoptera; (ii) determine the attraction of phytophagous thrips; (iii) assess the impact of these traps on beneficial insects; and (iv) assess the relationship between the density of Frankliniella thrips captured on traps and those found in the inflorescences. The use of colored sticky traps has revealed a great diversity of thrips and beneficial insects in the mango agroecosystem. A total of 16,441 thrips were caught on sticky traps throughout the sampling period, of which 16,251 (98.8%) were thrips adults and 190 (1.2%) larvae. Forty one species of thrips were collected either from sticky traps or from inflorescences. Of these, 32 species feed either on leaves or flowers. Frankliniella cephalica , F . gardeniae and F . invasor , were the most abundant species. Scirtothrips citri and S . manihoti were also captured among other phytophagous thrips. The white trap captured significantly more Frankliniella species and also had the smallest capture of beneficial insects. Yellow traps were the most attractive for Scirtothrips species, with low detrimental effects on insect pollinators, although high impact on natural enemies. Thrips species captured on sticky traps showed a low and non-significantly correlation with respect to the density of thrips in mango inflorescences. Although sticky traps did not predict the density of Frankliniella populations in mango inflorescences, the study represents a substantial progress in the use of color traps in mango agroecosystems. Colored sticky traps would be a good option for monitoring mango thrips to detect them at earlier stages of infestation to implement management tactics and avoid the building-up of thrips populations."
https://openalex.org/W4308077701,"Commonly used prediction methods for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were created before contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention was recognized as the primary therapy. Although several studies have used machine learning techniques for prognostic prediction of patients with AMI, its clinical application has not been achieved. Here, we developed an online application tool using a machine learning model to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI. A total of 2,553 cases of ST-elevation AMI were assigned to 80% training subset for cross validation and 20% test subset for model performance evaluation. We implemented random forest classifier for the binary classification of in-hospital mortality. The selected best feature set consisted of ten clinical and biological markers including max creatine phosphokinase, hemoglobin, heart rate, creatinine, systolic blood pressure, blood sugar, age, Killip class, white blood cells, and c-reactive protein. Our model achieved high performance: the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve for the test subset, 0.95: sensitivity, 0.89: specificity, 0.91: precision, 0.43: accuracy, 0.91 respectively, which outperformed common scoring methods. The freely available application tool for prognostic prediction can contribute to risk triage and decision-making in patient-centered modern clinical practice for AMI."
https://openalex.org/W4308077774,"Accurate capture finger of movements for biomechanical assessments has typically been achieved within laboratory environments through the use of physical markers attached to a participant’s hands. However, such requirements can narrow the broader adoption of movement tracking for kinematic assessment outside these laboratory settings, such as in the home. Thus, there is the need for markerless hand motion capture techniques that are easy to use and accurate enough to evaluate the complex movements of the human hand. Several recent studies have validated lower-limb kinematics obtained with a marker-free technique, OpenPose. This investigation examines the accuracy of OpenPose, when applied to images from single RGB cameras, against a ‘gold standard’ marker-based optical motion capture system that is commonly used for hand kinematics estimation. Participants completed four single-handed activities with right and left hands, including hand abduction and adduction, radial walking, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint flexion, and thumb opposition. The accuracy of finger kinematics was assessed using the root mean square error. Mean total active flexion was compared using the Bland–Altman approach, and the coefficient of determination of linear regression. Results showed good agreement for abduction and adduction and thumb opposition activities. Lower agreement between the two methods was observed for radial walking (mean difference between the methods of 5.03°) and MCP flexion (mean difference of 6.82°) activities, due to occlusion. This investigation demonstrated that OpenPose, applied to videos captured with monocular cameras, can be used for markerless motion capture for finger tracking with an error below 11° and on the order of that which is accepted clinically."

The researchers employed high-resolution continuous source atomic absorption spectrometry. The statistical parameters such as mean, range, minimum and maximum were computed along with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess activity concentrations of Major Chemical Carcinogens (MCCs) in the herb extracts from the three states. The result demonstrated substantial statistical variation in the concentration of Chromium between groups with C . papaya (F = 190.683, p = 0.000), P . guajava (F = 5.698, p = 0.006), A . digitata (F = 243.154, p = 0.000). The post hoc test revealed that the C. papaya and A. digitata observed concentrations were statistically significant across the three states (p = 0.000). It was observed that there is no statistically significant difference between concentrations of the extracts between Kano and Borno states for P . guajava (p = 0.686). For Cd, the one-way ANOVA showed significant statistically variation in the concentration between groups with C . papaya (F = 77.393, p = 0.000), P . guajava (F = 4.496, p = 0.017), A . digitata (F = 69.042, p = 0.000). The post hoc test with multiple comparisons revealed that the activity concentration of all extracts was statistically significant across the three states (p&lt;0.05). The target risk quotient (THQ) for Cd was more than unity in A . digitata and C . papaya , except for P . guajava from Borno State. The probable cancer risk was observed for consumption of plant extracts as a result of Cr and Cd."
https://openalex.org/W4308099063,"Background High-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows the detection of macular pathology and involvement of the optic nerve in a wide spectrum of diseases. For the differentiation of diseased and healthy status, normal values of retinal layer segmentation are critical. Yet, normative values mostly cover adult populations with only sparse data for paediatric cohorts. We present data of retinal layer characteristics via OCT in a healthy paediatric cohort. Methods This prospective cross-sectional study screened 75 healthy children (male = 42, female = 33, range 4–17 years) without visual problems. OCT was performed with a peripapillary ring and macula scan protocol to determine paediatric normative values for routine parameters (peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (pRNFL), total macular volume (TMV), macular retinal thickness (RT)). The macula scan (6mm grid) was segmented using the device-inherent automated segmentation software (Heidelberg Eye Explorer) for retinal layers: RNFL, ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL) in 9 segments each and mean of the 9 segments. Results We obtained OCT data of 72 children with mean age 12.49 years (standard deviation, SD, 2.18; minimum 3.93). Mean global pRNFL was 102.20 μm (SD 8.24), mean TMV 8.81 mm 3 (0.30) and mean RT (all segments) 318.22 μm (10.19). Segmented macular retinal layer thicknesses (mean of all segments) were: RNFL 27.67 μm (2.14), GCL 41.94 μm (2.50), IPL 34.97 μm (2.10), INL 35.18 μm (2.15), OPL 29.06 μm (2.24), ONL 68.35 μm (6.20). Conclusion The OCT is a useful non-invasive imaging technique for the examination of the retina in children with short duration, high imaging resolution and no known adverse effects. Normative values may serve as a comparator for different neuropaediatric disorders and are first presented with this study using an up-to-date and standardized OCT imaging technique."
https://openalex.org/W4308045161,"Adverse family-based lifestyle factors in the preconception period, pregnancy and early-childhood are major risk factors for childhood obesity and there is a growing consensus that early life interventions to prevent overweight and obesity in children are required. However, results from recent systematic reviews of preconception and pregnancy interventions have demonstrated mixed success. Therefore, this protocol presents a study aiming to summarise and evaluate complex preconception and pregnancy intervention components, process evaluation components, and authors’ statements, with a view to improving our understanding regarding their success and informing design or adaptation of more effective interventions to prevent childhood obesity. A scoping review will be conducted, using the frameworks of the JBI and Arksey and O’Malley. A two-step approach will be used to identify relevant literature: (1) systematic searches will be conducted in the databases PubMed, Embase and CENTRAL to identify all eligible preconception and pregnancy trials with offspring data; and (2) CLUSTER searches will be conducted to find linked publications to eligible trials (follow-ups, process evaluation publications). Two researchers will independently select studies, chart, and synthesise data. A qualitative thematic analysis will be performed in which statements related to process evaluation components and authors’ interpretations will be coded as “reasons”. A descriptive analysis will be performed to evaluate intervention complexity using a complex intervention framework (AHRQ series; Medical Research Council guidance). The results of this study, which will be discussed with an expert group as part of a consultation stage, aim to identify gaps and inform the design or adaptation of future preconception and pregnancy interventions and approaches to potentially increase success rates. We expect that our results, which will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, will be of interest to researchers, families, and practitioners concerned with good preconception and prenatal care, and healthy child outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4308045164,"Resilience is a system’s ability to withstand a disruption and return to a normal state quickly. It is a random variable due to the randomness of both the disruption and resilience behavior of a system. The distribution characteristics of resilience are the basis for resilience design and analysis, such as test sample size determination and assessment model selection. In this paper, we propose a systematic resilience distribution identification and analysis (RDIA) method based on a system’s performance processes after disruptions. Typical performance degradation/recovery processes have linear, exponential, and trigonometric functions, and they have three key parameters: the maximum performance degradation, the degradation duration, and the recovery duration. Using the Monte Carlo method, these three key parameters are first sampled according to their corresponding probability density functions. Combining the sample results with the given performance function type, the system performance curves after disruptions can be obtained. Then the sample resilience is computed using a deterministic resilience measure and the resilience distribution can be determined through candidate distribution identification, parameter estimation, and a goodness-of-fit test. Finally, we apply our RDIA method to systems with typical performance processes, and both the orthogonal experiment method and the control variable method are used to investigate the resilience distribution laws. The results show that the resilience of these systems follows the Weibull distribution. An end-to-end communication system is also used to explain how to apply this method with simulation or test data in practice."
https://openalex.org/W4308045165,"We examined whether dogs show emotional response to social stimuli played on videos. Secondary, we hypothesized that if dogs recognize themselves in videos, they will show a different emotional response to videos of self and other dogs. We compared heart rate variability among four video stimuli: a video of the owner ignoring another dog (OW-A-IGN), a video of a non-owner interacting with another dog (NOW-A-INT), a video of the owner interacting with another dog (OW-A-INT), and a video of the owner interacting with the dog subject (OW-S-INT). The results showed that root mean square of the difference between adjacent R-R Intervals (RMSSD) and standard deviation of the R-R Interval (SDNN) were lower in NOW-A-INT and OW-S-INT than in OW-A-IGN. There was no statistical difference in the responses to OW-S-INT and OW-A-INT, suggesting that dogs did not distinguish themselves and other dogs in videos. On the other hand, the difference in mean R-R Interval between OW-S-INT and OW-A-INT showed positive correlation with the score of attachment or attention-seeking behavior. Therefore, this study does not completely rule out self-recognition in dogs and there remains the possibility that the more attached a dog to its owner, the more distinct the dog’s emotional response to the difference between the self-video stimulus and the video stimulus of another dog. Further studies are needed to clarify this possibility."
https://openalex.org/W4308045184,"Understanding the structure of human sexual contact networks is vital in a broad range of disciplines, including sociology, biology, public health, and anthropology. However, sexual contact networks are yet to be understood because technical and privacy issues make it difficult to conduct accurate, large-scale surveys. In this study, we surveyed data openly available on one of the largest adult entertainment websites in Japan, where male clients (MCs) can write online customer reviews of female commercial sex workers (FCSWs). In particular, our investigation focused on a type of establishment called ""soapland,"" the only type of sex industry in Japan where sexual intercourse is publicly permitted. Soaplands are scattered throughout Japan, and the study website covers approximately 66% of them. Using such a vast amount of data on a nationwide scale, we clarified the network structure of commercial sex, characterized by small-world, scale-free, and disassortative mating properties. To study geographical characteristics, we compared the resulting network with three different artificially generated networks via the random rewiring of links. Moreover, we considered a simple epidemic model on the resulting network, and investigated whether it would be more effective to provide infection control measures to FCSWs or MCs. We determined that active FCSWs constitute an important pathway of infection propagation in commercial sex networks, but MCs also play an essential role as weak ties."
https://openalex.org/W4308045201,"Background Only a few observational studies using small patient samples and one subgroup analysis have compared norepinephrine and dopamine for the treatment of cardiogenic shock (CS). The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the use of norepinephrine was associated with improvements in clinical outcomes in CS patients compared to dopamine. Methods We retrospectively reviewed hospital medical records of patients who were admitted to cardiac intensive care unit from 2012 to 2018. We included 520 patients with CS in this analysis. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and serial hemodynamic data were also assessed. Results As a first-line vasopressor, dopamine was used in 156 patients (30%) and norepinephrine in 364 patients (70%). Overall, the norepinephrine group had significantly higher severity of shock, arrest at presentation, vital signs, and lactic acid than did the dopamine group at the time of vasopressor initiation. Nevertheless, in the norepinephrine group, additional vasopressor was required in 123 patients (33.8%), which was a significantly smaller percentage than the 92 patients (56.4%) in the dopamine group who required additional vasopressor (p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between the two groups (26.9% and 31.9%, respectively, p = 0.26). In addition, the incidence of arrhythmia was not different between the two groups (atrial fibrillation, 12.2% vs. 15.7%, p = 0.30; ventricular tachyarrhythmia, 19.9% vs. 25.3%, p = 0.18). Conclusions The use of norepinephrine as a first-line vasopressor was not associated with reductions of in-hospital mortality or arrythmia but could reduce use of additional vasopressors in CS patients."
https://openalex.org/W4308077117,"This study explores pandemic-related changes in Twitter communication by examining differences in emotional, psychological and social sentiment between alcohol-related tweets and a random sample of non-alcohol tweets during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two equivalent size sets of English-language, COVID-specific tweets posted between February 1 st and April 20 th , 2020 are examined. The first set includes 1.5 million tweets containing alcohol-related keywords, while the second set does not contain such references. LIWC software analyzed the tweets for sentiment factors. ANCOVAs were used to determine whether language use significantly differed between the sets, considering differences in the pandemic period (before or after the pandemic declaration) while controlling for the number of tweets. The study found that tweets in the 40 days after March 11, 2020 contained more authentic language, more affiliation-oriented language, and exhibited more positive emotion than tweets in the 40 days pre-declaration. Alcohol-related status was a significant factor only when tweets contained personal concerns, regardless of pandemic period. Authenticity levels increased significantly in alcohol-related tweets post-declaration. The findings suggest alcohol may play a lesser role in the expression of psychological, social, and emotional sentiment than the pandemic period, but interaction between authentic language and alcohol references may reflect an increased use of alcohol for coping."
https://openalex.org/W4308077222,"Ursolic acid (UA), a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid obtained from fruit and several traditional Chinese medicinal plants, exhibits anti-inflammatory and hypoglycemic properties. However, its protective effects against type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) have not been explored. In this study, streptozotocin-induced T1DM rat models were established and treated with UA for six weeks. T1DM rats treated with UA were used to observe the effects of UA on body weight and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels. Pathological changes in the pancreas were observed using immunohistochemical staining. The gut microbiota distribution was measured using 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing. The proportions of Th17 and Treg cells were examined using flow cytometry. Protein and mRNA expression of molecules involved in Th17/Treg cell differentiation were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. The correlation between gut microbiota and Th17/Treg cell differentiation in T1DM was analyzed using redundancy analysis (RDA) analysis. Compared with the model group, FBG levels declined, and the progressive destruction of pancreatic β cells was alleviated. The diversity and uniformity of gut microbiota in T1DM rats treated with UA increased significantly. Interestingly, the Th17/Treg cell differentiation imbalance was corrected and positively correlated with the expression of Foxp3 and IL-10, and negatively correlated with the expression of RORγt, IL-17A, and TNF-α. These findings suggest that UA can lower FBG levels in T1DM rats, delay the progressive destruction of pancreatic β-cells, and modulate gut microbiota homeostasis and immune function in streptozotocin-induced T1DM rats."
https://openalex.org/W4308077283,"Household composition may be an important factor associated with anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic as people spend more time at home due to physical distancing and lockdown restrictions. Adults living with children-especially women-may be particularly vulnerable to anxiety as they balance additional childcare responsibilities and homeschooling with work. The objective of this study was to examine the association between household composition and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and explore gender as an effect modifier.Data were derived from seven waves of a national online survey of Canadian adults aged 18+ years from May 2020 to March 2021, which used quota sampling by age, gender, and region proportional to the English-speaking Canadian population (n = 7,021). Multivariable logistic and modified least-squares regression models were used.Compared to those living alone, significantly greater odds of anxiety symptoms were observed among single parents/guardians (aOR = 2.00; 95%CI: 1.41-2.84), those living with adult(s) and child(ren) (aOR = 1.39; 95%CI: 1.10-1.76), and those living with adult(s) only (aOR = 1.22; 95%CI: 1.00-1.49). Gender was a significant effect modifier on the additive scale (p = 0.0487) such that the association between living with child(ren) and anxiety symptoms was stronger among men than women.Additional tailored supports are needed to address anxiety among adults living with children-especially men-during the COVID-19 pandemic and future infectious disease events."
https://openalex.org/W4308077317,"Background Functional disability is a common public health problem that affects the health and quality of life of older adults. This causes them to be highly dependent on other members of their family, receive home care, or to be institutionalized. Although functional disability has been widely studied in developed country settings, very limited studies have focused on age-related functional disability in sub-Saharan Africa, and in particular Ghana. The purpose of this study is to assess various factors associated with the difficulties in performing basic and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults in Ghana. Methods This cross-sectional study used data on 1610 older adults aged 50 years and above from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) survey Wave II conducted in Ghana. Nine standard functioning difficulty tools of WHODAS II was used for the analysis. The WHODAS II offers continuous summary scores with higher scores showing higher disability, and vice versa. A multi-level regression model was used to identify individual and household level risk factors linked to the functional disability of older adults. Results Female older adults (53.7%) reported having functional disability. The mean functional disability among older adults aged 50 years and above was 5.2 (± 5.9). Results indicated that older adults who are females, aged 70 years and above, and had three or more chronic conditions had a higher functional disability. Also, older adults who have adequate fruit intake and belong to wealthier households were found to have a lower functional disability. Conclusions The study reveals that functional disability among older adults is frequent in Ghana and is associated with having three or more chronic conditions and being overweight/obese. Prevention of functional disability in old age in Ghana is therefore a matter of great social and economic concern, which calls for coordinate efforts across the board to mitigate this public health challenge."
https://openalex.org/W4308077318,"Stripe rust disease of wheat, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, (Pst) is one of the most serious diseases of wheat worldwide. In India, virulent stripe rust races have been constantly evolving in the North-Western Plains Zone leading to the failure of some of the most widely grown resistant varieties in the region. With the goal of studying the recent evolution of virulent races in this region, we conducted whole-genome re-sequencing of three prevalent Indian Pst pathotypes Pst46S119, Pst78S84 and Pst110S119. We assembled 58.62, 58.33 and 55.78 Mb of Pst110S119, Pst46S119 and Pst78S84 genome, respectively and found that pathotypes were highly heterozygous. Comparative phylogenetic analysis indicated the recent evolution of pathotypes Pst110S119 and Pst78S84 from Pst46S119. Pathogenicity-related genes classes (CAZyme, proteases, effectors, and secretome proteins) were identified and found to be under positive selection. Higher rate of gene families expansion were also observed in the three pathotypes. A strong association between the effector genes and transposable elements may be the source of the rapid evolution of these strains. Phylogenetic analysis differentiated the Indian races in this study from other known United States, European, African, and Asian races. Diagnostic markers developed for the identification of three Pst pathotypes will help tracking of yellow rust at farmers field and strategizing resistance gene deployment."
https://openalex.org/W4308077386,"Although corporate environmental performance has received widespread attention and its economic consequences have been studied in the literature, little is known about the motivation of firms to choose different environmental strategies (corporate environmental expenditures). Constructing an indicator for the capitalization of corporate environmental expenditures, we explore corporate environmental strategies. This paper investigates the impact of environmental legislation on the capitalization of corporate environmental expenditures. By analyzing data on manual environmental expenditures of Chinese listed companies from 2011 to 2020, we find that implementing the new Environmental Protection Law (EPL) can enhance the capitalization of corporate environmental expenditures of high polluting firms. The effect is stronger for firms with higher external legitimacy pressures, such as those with greater public supervision and environmental enforcement. Firms with more internal resources are more likely to experience this effect, as evidenced by lower financing constraints and less managerial myopia. Further mechanistic studies suggest that implementing new EPL raises environmental media attention and perceived environmental risk among high polluting firms. This paper contributes to the environmental accounting literature by introducing a novel measure of corporate environmental strategy-the capitalization of corporate environmental expenditures. It investigates the effect of environmental regulation on the capitalization of corporate environmental expenditures to provide a reference for polluting firms' corporate environmental strategy and the implementation of the EPL in China."
https://openalex.org/W4308077387,"Objectives Many students seem to find pharmacology learning very challenging due to the complexity and variety of drugs they have to study. The number of drugs the students have to learn, the duration of time to learn the medications, and the evolving nature of diseases demanded learning beyond the classroom walls. This study explored and described nursing students’ experiences in community and hospital-based pharmacy practice sites during their service-learning and its implications for pharmacology pedagogical practices. Methods Kolb’s learning theory provided the framework to explore nursing students’ 48-hour service-learning experiences at community/hospital-based pharmacies in Belize and its implications for pharmacology pedagogy. The study utilized two qualitative approaches, reflective journals and focus group interviews, to collect data from 46 second-year nursing students. NVivo software and coding schemes were employed to analyze the data from the interviews and reflective journals. Results Students reported learning medications, integrating classroom pharmacological knowledge at pharmacy practice sites, acquiring and enhancing communication skills, interpreting prescriptions, dispensing medications, drug calculations, taking inventory, doing vital signs, and patient education. In addition, students reported experiencing inter-professional relationships as healthcare team members. Anxiety was a major challenge experienced by many students at the beginning of the service-learning experience. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of experiential learning of pharmacology amongst second year nursing students, offering the opportunity to inform and support pharmacotherapeutics educators in designing strategies for more effective teaching of medications to nursing students. It also supports the addition of pharmacy placements to the nursing curriculum’ as it shows that nursing students can learn medications, skills, and teamwork from experiential pharmacy site posting. Combining classroom instruction with pharmacy experiential service learning might be an effective complement for teaching nursing pharmacology."
https://openalex.org/W4308077447,"Carnivores are ecologically important and sensitive to habitat loss and anthropogenic disruption. Here we measured trophic level and gut bacterial composition as proxies of carnivore ecological status across the Upper Peninsula, Michigan, for wild American marten ( Martes americana ; hereafter marten). In contrast to studies that have focused on omnivorous and herbivorous species, we find that marten, like other carnivore species without a cecum, are dominated by Firmicutes (52.35%) and Proteobacteria (45.31%) but lack Bacteroidetes. Additionally, a majority of the 12 major bacterial genera (occurring at ≥1%) are known hydrogen producers, suggesting these taxa may contribute to host energy requirements through fermentative production of acetate. Our study suggests that live trapping and harvest methods yield similar marten gut microbiome data. In addition, preserving undisturbed forest likely impacts marten ecology by measurably increasing marten trophic level and altering the gut microbiome. Our study underscores the utility of the gut microbiome as a tool to monitor the ecological status of wild carnivore populations."
https://openalex.org/W4308077451,"Disposable plastics are drawing considerable attention as a source of environmental risk despite their benefits in daily life. Banning the use of disposable plastics could increase other types of risks, which may damage the public good in the long run. Considering the trade-off of the risks and benefits, one way to improve social welfare is to conduct proper recycling and to continue using plastics but limit them to essential use, avoiding an unnecessary ban. A potential barrier to such a policy might be risk-averse attitudes toward actions that are perceived to threaten future generations, which is a well-known phenomenon. We previously designed a framework for information provision using messages that remind individuals about familial support, which had significant effects in multiple countries on increasing positive attitudes toward air pollution caused by industrialization. We hypothesized that this information provision could also be effective for disposable plastic use. Thus, we conducted a randomized controlled trial via online surveys in Japan, Canada, and the US to identify the effects of our designed messages about recycling on increasing positive attitudes toward disposable plastics. The intervention effects were measured by the difference-in-difference method and panel analysis based on linear regression models using the respondents’ attributes and personality traits. The effects were consistently correlated with a sense of familial support, with the effect sizes varying according to country (US &gt; Japan &gt; Canada). Attributes that positively contributed to the message being more effective were higher agreeableness, lower Machiavellianism, lower psychopathy, and being a woman. Although personal fear about COVID-19 moderated the message effects, concern about the threats to relatives and family boosted the effects. Although the effect sizes were influenced by external factors, the results suggested that our proposed framework for information provision has the potential to be applied to a wider variety of risk-related topics."

How should a distant transgression be taken to reflect on the present? Across multiple years, political figures and incidents, we found that people’s subjective perceptions of time concerning political candidate’s histories can differ radically, regardless of objective fact; political bias shapes people’s perception of the time of things past. Results showed that despite equidistant calendar time, people subjectively view a favored politician’s successes and opposing politician’s failures as much closer in time, while a favored politician’s failures and opponent’s success seem much further away. Studies 1–3 tested the proposed phenomena across distinct (real and hypothetical) political contexts, while Study 4 tested the causal effects of temporal distance framing. Study 5 provided a final preregistered test of the findings. Overall, we demonstrate that partisans can protect their candidates and attack opponents by shifting their perception of time."
https://openalex.org/W4308077594,"Previous studies have investigated the determinants of urban tourism development from the various attributes of neighborhood quality. However, traditional methods to assess neighborhood quality are often subjective, costly, and only on a small scale. To fill this research gap, this study applies the recent development in big data of street view images, deep learning algorithms, and image processing technology to assess quantitatively four attributes of neighborhood quality, namely street facilities, architectural landscape, green or ecological environment, and scene visibility. The paper collects more than 7.8 million Baidu SVPs of 232 prefecture-level cities in China and applies deep learning techniques to recognize these images. This paper then tries to examine the influence of neighborhood quality on regional tourism development. Empirical results show that both levels of street facilities and greenery environment promote tourism. However, the construction intensity of the landscape has an inhibitory influence on the development of tourism. The threshold test shows that the intensity of the influence varies with the city's overall economic level. These conclusions are of great significance for the development of China's urban construction and tourism economy, and also provide a useful reference for policymakers. The methodological procedure is reduplicative and can be applied to other challenging cases."

https://openalex.org/W4308077705,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with far-reaching changes all over the world. Health care systems were and are also affected. Little is known about the impact of these changes and the duration of the pandemic on people with mental disorders. The aim of this longitudinal follow-up study was to investigate the mental health status, medical care provision, and attitudes towards the pandemic of these people at the end of the second pandemic lockdown in Germany in 2021, and to compare these findings with the results of 2020. Methods People with mental disorders currently receiving treatment in the psychiatric outpatient department of the University Hospital Leipzig, Germany, were asked about depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), self-reported medical care provision, attitudes and social and emotional aspects of the pandemic (social support [ESSI], perceived stress [PSS-4], loneliness [UCLA-3-LS], and resilience [BRS]) using structured telephone interviews. Results In total, N = 75 participants who had already participated in the first survey in 2020 took part in the follow-up telephone interviews. The most frequent clinician-rated diagnoses were attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( n = 21; 28.0%) and obsessive-compulsive disorder ( n = 16; 21.3%). In comparison to 2020, a significantly higher proportion of participants reported no problems in receiving medical care provision. Compared to the previous year, the resilience of the participants had significantly decreased. Depressive symptoms, social support, perceived stress, and loneliness remained stable. Significantly more participants felt restricted by the pandemic-related government measures in 2021 than in 2020. Conclusions This study highlights the importance for continued efforts to maintain stable medical care provision for people with mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, as except for a decrease in resilience, mental health status remained stable. Nonetheless there is still a need for continued treatment to stabilise and improve this status."
https://openalex.org/W4308077707,"Knowledge of genetic interrelationships and grouping among pigeonpea germplasm collections is fundamental to selecting breeding parents with unique genetic constitutions. The objectives of this study were to assess the genetic diversity and genetic grouping present among 81 pigeonpea genotypes collected from Malawi, Tanzania and Kenya using 4122 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and complementary morphological traits. The SNP markers and phenotypic traits revealed significant genetic variation among the assessed genotypes. The test genotypes were resolved into three distinct clusters based on both marker systems. The mean gene diversity and the polymorphic information content (PIC) were 0.14 and 0.11, suggesting moderate genetic differentiation among the genotypes. The analysis of molecular variance revealed that differences among populations accounted for only 2.7% of the variation, while within the population (among individuals) accounted for 97.3% of the variation. The results based on the DArT SNP genotyping complemented the phenotypic data and led to the selection of unique pigeonpea genotypes for effective breeding programs in Malawi and related agroecologies. This suggested that unique breeding populations could be created by identifying and selecting divergent individuals as parental lines. There is a need to create a new genetic variation or introgress genes from genetically unrelated parents to increase the genetic base of the current pigeonpea breeding populations."
https://openalex.org/W4308077713,"In this study, we focused on the storage conditions and investigated the effects of low-temperature storage (10°C) on the dispersibility of active components in three formulations of fluorometholone (FLU) suspension eye-drops (one original drug and two generic drugs, P1-P3). For all three eye-drop products, before shaking by hand, white sediment anticipated to be the principal active component was seen at the vial base. In the ordinary-temperature storage group, the FLU contents per drop after shaking by hand were 0.076% in P1, 0.023% in P2, and 0.100% in P3, and the content in P2 was significantly lower than that in P1 and P3. In contrast, almost no dispersion was observed in the low-temperature group. The results after sufficient shaking of these samples with a vortex, in contrast, were such that the FLU contents per drop were 0.063% in P1, 0.086% in P2, and 0.088% in P3; the content in P1 was significantly lower than that in P2 and P3, and there was no difference between P2 and P3. Moreover, we evaluated the dispersibility according to the evaluation “ V s / ( ρ g − ρ f ) g.” In both the low- and ordinary-temperature storage groups, the value of V s / ( ρ g − ρ f ) g, proportional to the terminal velocity, decreased in the following order: P3 &gt; P1 ≫ P2, and each value in the ordinary-temperature was higher than that in low temperature. The zeta potential decreased in the following order: P2 &gt; P3 ≫ P1. In conclusion, when FLU suspension eye drops are stored at low temperatures until use, such as in a refrigerator, ordinary shaking does not help achieve dispersion to the specified concentration, and even with vigorous shaking with some formulations, the specified concentration cannot be achieved."

However, there is currently a lack of evidence on the relationship between frailty and readmission rates among patients with CIED. This study investigated whether preoperative frailty influenced readmission rates among patients with CIED over a one-year period following implantation. The study retrospectively analyzed 101 patients who underwent CIED implantations. To compare frailty-based differences in their characteristics and readmission rates, these participants were categorized into frailty and non-frailty groups via the modified frailty index (mFI). The frailty group had a significantly higher readmission rate than the non-frailty group (non-frailty group vs. frailty group = 1 vs. 8 patients: P &lt; 0.05). Further, a multivariate analysis showed that frailty was a significant readmission factor. Based on individual analyses with/without histories of HF, the readmission rate also tended to be higher among individuals considered frail via the mFI (readmission rate in HF patients: non-frailty group vs. frailty group = 1 vs. 5 patients: P = 0.65; non-HF patients: non-frailty group vs. frailty group = 0 vs. 3 patients: P = 0.01). Participants with preoperative frailty showed higher readmission rates within a one-year period following implantation compared to those without preoperative frailty. This tendency was consistent regardless of HF history. The mFI may thus help predict readmission among patients with CIED."

Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is an essential preventive measure to help end the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A multi-center retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients in Libya who had received single-dose licensed three different types of vaccines (Oxford/AstraZeneca, CoronaVac, or Sputnik-V) and were admitted to healthcare centers with SARS-CoV-2 infection from 30th April to 15th July 2021. In this study, the number of people infected with SARS-COV-2 and the mortality rate from daily reports issued by the National Centers for Disease Control of Libya (NCDC) were collected. Approximately 445000 single doses of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine were administered in Libya from April to July 2021. In corresponding, 39996 people were infected during this period. It has been found that among the people who did not receive any vaccine, the number of patients infected by SARS-COV-2 and admitted to the healthcare centers, and died was (N = 3176 patients (7.94%), and 266 (7.10%) respectively). Compared to 43 (0.10%) of those admitted to healthcare centers who had taken a single dose from one of the licensed vaccines, of which 8 patients (0.02%) died during this period. The documented 23 patients were those who admitted to healthcare centers and got vaccinated with the CoronaVac (Sinovac) vaccine. Fourteen patients received Oxford/AstraZeneca. Only 2 patients received the Sputnik V vaccine. Of the breakthrough infection cases reviewed, 8 patients died. No deaths due to breakthrough infection among Sputnik V vaccinated patients were reported. In conclusion, a single dose of the three different types of the vaccine has significantly reduced virus interpersonal transmission and also showed a decrease in the mortality rate until the tenth week in Libya. The present study demonstrates the extent of the remarkable success of the early rollout of the coronavirus national vaccination campaign."
https://openalex.org/W4308098941,"Despite multidisciplinary therapy, the prognosis is poor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In the locally advanced stage, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by surgery could provide survival benefits to some patients. Here, we aimed to identify for tumor therapy response a biomarker based on RNA sequencing. We collected endoscopic biopsies of 32 ESCC patients, who were divided according to nCRT response, into two groups: the complete response group (n = 13) and the non-complete response group (n = 19). RNA-sequencing data showed that 464 genes were differentially expressed. Increased in non-complete response group, 4 genes increased expressions were AGR2 (anterior gradient 2) , GADD45B (growth arrest and DNA damage inducible beta) , PPP1R15A (protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A) and LRG1 (leucine rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1) . The areas under the curve (AUC) of the AGR2 gene was 0.671 according to read counts of RNA-seq and therapy response of nCRT. In vitro study showed that apoptosis cell was significantly increased in the AGR2- knockdown TE-2 cell line treated with cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), when compared with si-control. Results suggest that in ESCC, the AGR2 gene is a promising and predictive gene marker for the response to anti-tumor therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4308099018,"Research on the increasing incidence of allergic diseases evidenced the role of diet as a potential key factor. Diet can modulate the low-grade systemic inflammation related to obesity and several diseases. There are no published data on drug allergy.To investigate a potential association between diet, including dietary inflammatory index (DII), and drug allergy. Also, to evaluate correlations between diet and obesity, inflammatory and metabolic parameters in patients with drug allergy.Ninety consecutive patients studied for suspected drug allergy were evaluated in terms of dietary parameters, anthropometric measurements, bioimpedance and biochemical analysis. DII was calculated based on information collected from a food frequency questionnaire.After diagnostic work-up, 39 patients had confirmed drug allergy and 45 excluded, representing the study group and the control group, respectively. The majority (79%) were female, with mean age of 39.58±13.3 years. The 84 subjects revealed an anti-inflammatory diet pattern. No significative difference was found in DII scores between drug allergic patients and controls (-3.37±0.95 vs -3.39±0.86, p = 0.985). However, the patients with drug allergy revealed higher obesity and inflammatory parameters. A significative negative correlation was found between DII and adiponectin levels, in the control group (r = -0.311, p = 0.040). In the patient group, a significative positive correlation was observed between DII and triglycerides (r = 0.359, p = 0.032). No other correlations were found between DII and the assessed parameters. Patients with drug allergy presented a significative higher intake of mono-unsaturated fatty-acids comparing to controls (19.8±3.7 vs 17.8 ± 4.0, p = 0.021). No other statistically significant differences were achieved in dietary parameters, between patients and controls.The population assessed in this study revealed an anti-inflammatory diet profile. Although we have found in a previous work that the same patients with drug allergy revealed higher obesity and inflammatory parameters, the DII did not allow to distinguish between patients with drug allergy or controls. The DII scores correlated with triglycerides levels in the drug allergy patients and inversely with adiponectin levels in the control group. Larger studies are needed to clarify the potential role of the diet in drug allergy and its outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4308099020,"In recent years there has been an increasing interest in understanding the role apathy plays in mediating the relationship between cognitive impairment and functional outcome. In general, most studies measure cognition with traditional cognitive tests that give explicit instructions and guide the participants toward generating a response. However, given that apathy is defined by a decrease in self-initiated behavior, it is crucial to evaluate cognition with ecological tasks that do not explicitly direct the patient´s motivation to generate behaviors to assess the actual effect. This study investigated whether an ecological cognitive assessment (the Jansari Executive Function Assessment, JEF © ) would uniquely contribute to the relationship between cognition, apathy, and functional outcome in schizophrenia. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), neuropsychological tests and the JEF © were administered to 20 patients with schizophrenia. Hierarchical multiple regression and mediation analysis were performed to test the associations between the variables of interest. Results showed that JEF © explained a significant portion of the variance in AES (25%). In addition, apathy explained 36% of the variance in functional outcome. However, AES did not mediate between cognition and functional outcome. Our results highlight the importance of assessing cognition with tasks that require integration of cognitive functions needed for real life demands."
https://openalex.org/W4308099080,"Cannabis is commonly used among people who drink alcohol, yet evidence on acute effects of co-use is conflicting. Two important variables that may influence the effects of cannabis and alcohol are cannabinoid content (i.e., the ratio of cannabidiol [CBD] and 9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]) as well as the order of use (i.e., cannabis before alcohol vs. alcohol before cannabis). Research is mixed regarding the acute imapct of cannabis on alcohol consumption and intoxication, with some studies suggesting additive effects of alcohol and cannabis, and others demonstrating negligible effects of combining these substances. Further complicating this, high-THC-content cannabis concentrates are increasingly popular on the legal-market, but to our knowledge, no studies have explored concentrate and alcohol co-use. In addition to cannabinoid content, order of use may influence intoxication and other acute effects, but is also understudied. Co-use studies typically administer a fixed dose of alcohol before cannabis, and there is a lack of data on the acute effects of cannabis before alcohol. Thus, there is a need for experimental co-use studies exploring the impact of cannabinoid content (particularly of highly potent cannabis concentrates) and order effects on intoxication. This study uses a federally-compliant mobile laboratory procedure to explore the effects of co-administration of legal-market cannabis concentrates with a moderate alcohol dose (.8g/kg) in a sample of community participants who regularly use alcohol and cannabis. The study will also explore alcohol and cannabis order effects (cannabis before alcohol vs. alcohol before cannabis). Outcomes are objective intoxication (measured using blood cannabinoid level, heart rate, psychomotor performance and breath alcohol level [BrAC]) and subjective intoxication (assessed via self-report measures). Overall, this study may influence harm-reduction recommendations for individuals who drink alcohol and use cannabis."
