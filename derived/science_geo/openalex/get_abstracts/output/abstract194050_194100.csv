Evidence is available that absorptive or adsorptive diffusion of IAA into the coleoptile sections is negligible and Insufficient to account for the disappearance of IAA from the medium. Exhaustive ether extractions and bioassay of the sections for IAA preclude this possibility. Controls on the medium in which the sections had soaked 12 hr previously also showed negligible IAA destruction by possible microorganism contaminants (L. Anker, thesis, p. 27, Univ. of Utrecht, 1953); L. Reinhold, The New Phytologist 53, 219 (1954). 8. This response, although not obtained from enzyme breis preps., would seem to obviate the findings of Goldacre et al. (9) that the presence of 2,4-dichlorophenol in samples of 2,4-D is largely, if not solely, responsible for the enhanced inactivation in vitro. Further, analysis of the sample of 2,4-D used in the present investigations showed less than 3 x 10AM DCP, as given by the FolinCiocalteau reagent. 9. P. L. Goldacre, A. W. Galston, and R. L.

In summarizing this symposium, I expressed to our hosts, the Office of Naval Research and the University of Pennsylvania, our deep appreciation for their hospitality and for what all agreed was the great success and stimulation of this meeting. It was rather good to see Government, and particularly military science, tied up with civilian science. It was also good to see the applied so deeply woven with the theoretical. We were concerned, of course, on the one hand, with the enormously important specific problems of the antibiotics, herbicides, and insecticides, with drug resistance and addiction, with the development of resistance to epidemics due to bacteria and other organisms. Yet, on the other hand, these very practical matters do reduce, I think, to the general theory of the interaction of systems with their environment over the course of time; and this is a problem of microevoluition. So we were dealing, for those 2(1/2) days, with modern experiments in the general field of evolution."
