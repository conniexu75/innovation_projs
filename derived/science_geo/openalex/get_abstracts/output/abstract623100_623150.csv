https://openalex.org/W2903535361,"Background The increasing numbers of people living with HIV (PLHIV) who are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) have near normal life-expectancy, resulting in more people living with HIV over the age of 50 years (PLHIV50+). Estimates of the number of PLHIV50+ are needed for the development of tailored therapeutic and prevention interventions at country, regional and global level. Methods The AIDS Impact Module of the Spectrum software was used to compute the numbers of PLHIV, new infections, and AIDS-related deaths for PLHIV50+ for the years 2000–2016. Projections until 2020 were calculated based on an assumed ART scale-up to 81% coverage by 2020, consistent with the UNAIDS 90–90–90 treatment targets. Results Globally, there were 5.7 million [4.7 million– 6.6 million] PLHIV50+ in 2016. The proportion of PLHIV50+ increased substantially from 8% in 2000 to 16% in 2016 and is expected to increase to 21% by 2020. In 2016, 80% of PLHIV50+ lived in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with Eastern and Southern Africa containing the largest number of PLHIV50+. While the proportion of PLHIV50+ was greater in high income countries, LMICs have higher numbers of PLHIV50+ that are expected to continue to increase by 2020. Conclusions The number of PLHIV50+ has increased dramatically since 2000 and this is expected to continue by 2020, especially in LMICs. HIV prevention campaigns, testing and treatment programs should also focus on the specific needs of PLHIV50+. Integrated health and social services should be developed to cater for the changing physical, psychological and social needs of PLHIV50+, many of whom will need to use HIV and non-HIV services."

Economical and efficient ways are needed to address this problem worldwide. In this regard, exploration and application of proficient microbial strains that can help the crop plants to thrive in agricultural soils that are greatly contaminated with heavy metals. The present study mainly focused on the effect of IAA producing endophytic fungi Penicillium ruqueforti Thom., on wheat plants cultivated in soil rich in heavy metals (Ni, Cd, Cu, Zn, and Pb). P. ruqueforti has induced great resistance in wheat inoculated plants grown in heavy metal contaminated soil. Application of the isolated strain of P. ruqueforti restricted the transfer of heavy metals from soil to the plants by secreting indole acetic acid (IAA). Furthermore, P. ruqueforti inoculated wheat seedlings watered with waste water had higher plant growth, nutrient uptake and low concentrations of heavy metals in shoot and roots. On the contrary, non-inoculated wheat plants under heavy metal stress had stunted growth with symptoms of chlorosis. From the results, it is concluded that P. ruqueforti inoculation can establish a symbiotic relationship with host plants, which is useful for phytostabilization of heavy metals or in other words helping the host crops to flourish through soil that are highly contaminated with heavy metals."
https://openalex.org/W2902154678,"Objectives This study aimed to assess the correlation of temporal muscle thickness (TMT), measured on routine cranial magnetic resonance (MR) images, with lumbar skeletal muscles obtained on computed tomography (CT) images in brain metastasis patients to establish a new parameter estimating skeletal muscle mass on brain MR images. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the cross-sectional area (CSA) of skeletal muscles at the level of the third lumbar vertebra on computed tomography scans and correlated these values with TMT on MR images of the brain in two independent cohorts of 93 lung cancer and 61 melanoma patients (overall: 154 patients) with brain metastases. Results Pearson correlation revealed a strong association between mean TMT and CSA in lung cancer and melanoma patients with brain metastases (0.733; p<0.001). The two study cohorts did not differ significantly in patient characteristics, including age (p = 0.661), weight (p = 0.787), and height (p = 0.123). However, TMT and CSA measures differed significantly between male and female patients in both lung cancer and melanoma patients with brain metastases (p<0.001). Conclusion Our data indicate that TMT, measured on routine cranial MR images, is a useful surrogate parameter for the estimation of skeletal muscle mass in patients with brain metastases. Thus, TMT may be useful for prognostic assessment, treatment considerations, and stratification or a selection factor for clinical trials in patients with brain metastases. Further studies are needed to assess the association between TMT and clinical frailty parameters, and the usefulness of TMT in patients with primary brain tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2903100917,"Extraction and quantification of nano- and microplastics from sediments and soils is challenging. Although no standard method has been established so far, flotation is commonly used to separate plastic from mineral material. The objective of this study was to test the efficiency of flotation for the extraction of nano- and microplastics from biosolids and soil. We spiked biosolids and soil samples with polystyrene nano- and microbeads (0.05, 1.0, 2.6, 4.8, and 100 μm diameter). Different extraction methods (w/ and w/o H2O2 digestion) were tested, and plastic beads were separated from mineral particles by flotation in a ZnCl2 solution. Plastic particles were quantified by UV-Vis spectrometry and gravimetrically. While large beads (100 μm) could be quantitatively extracted (∼100%) from both biosolids and soils, smaller beads had low extraction efficiencies (ranging from 5 to 80%, with an average of 20%). Except for the 100 μm beads, oxidation with H2O2 negatively impacted the extraction efficiencies. For the soil, extraction with water only, followed by flotation in a ZnCl2 solution, resulted in relatively high extraction efficiencies (>75%) for beads larger than 1 μm, but low efficiencies (<30%) for the 0.05 and 1.0 μm beads. Our results indicate that while flotation generally works to separate plastic nano- and microbeads in a solution, the challenge is to quantitatively extract nano- and microbeads from a biosolids or soil matrix. Samples high in organic matter content require removal of the organic matter, but the common method of H2O2 oxidation leads to poor extraction efficiencies for nano- and microbeads."
https://openalex.org/W2903198009,"Background HIV self-testing (HIVST) addresses barriers to HIV diagnosis among men, but current approaches to distributing HIVST kits only reach a subset of the men requiring testing. Methods We conducted a pilot trial of the secondary distribution of HIVST kits through peer networks in fishing communities of Buliisa district (Uganda). We recruited distributors (“seeds”) among male patients of a health facility, and among community members. Seeds were trained in HIVST and asked to distribute up to five kits to their peers (“recruits”). Recruits were referred to the study using a coupon, and asked to return the HIVST kit (used or unused). The accuracy of HIVST was measured against a confirmatory test conducted by a health worker. We conducted audio computer assisted self-interviews to measure the occurrence of adverse events, and evaluate the potential yield of peer-delivered HIVST. We also assessed how seeds and recruits rated their experience with peer-distributed HIVST. Results Nineteen seeds offered an HIVST kit to 116 men, and 95 (81.9%) accepted the offer. No recruit reported coercion, but two seeds experienced hostility from recruits or their family members. The sensitivity of peer-distributed HIVST, as interpreted by recruits, was 100%, and its specificity was 92.8%. Among recruits, 29 had never tested (25.8%), and 42 (44.2%) had tested more than a year ago. Three men living with HIV learned their status through peer-distributed HIVST (yield = 1 new diagnosis per 6.3 seeds). Most recruits (85/88) and seeds (19/19) reported that they would recommend HIVST to their friends and family. All seeds stated that they would accept acting as peer distributors again. Conclusions This novel peer-based distribution model of HIVST is safe, and has high uptake. It could help reduce the gender gap in HIV testing in under-served fishing communities in Uganda and elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2902177190,"Background In 2010, a ten–valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) was introduced in the routine infant national immunization program in Brazil. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by serotype 19A (Spn19A) increased after the introduction of PCVs in several countries. We compared the frequency, antimicrobial resistance and molecular patterns of invasive Spn19A strains before and after PCV10 introduction in Brazil using data from the national laboratory-based surveillance. Methods We analyzed invasive Spn19A strains isolated from 2005–2009 (pre-PCV10 period), 2011–2015 and 2016–2017 (post-PCV10 periods). Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed for all Spn19A strains, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed for strains isolated in the age groups <5 years and ≥50 years. Results Among the study period, a total of 9,852 invasive Spn strains were analyzed, and 673 (6.8%) belonged to serotype 19A. Overall, the proportion of Spn19A among the total number of IPD strains increased from 2.8% in 2005–2009 to 7.0% and 16.4% in 2011–2015 and 2016–2017, respectively. The relative increase in Spn19A was observed especially in children <5 years old (2005–2009: 3.2%; 2011–2015: 15.5%; 2016–2017: 31.2%). The percentage of penicillin resistance (MIC 2.0–4.0 μg/mL), erythromycin resistance and multidrug resistance (MDR) increased after PCV10 introduction due to the expansion of the MDR clonal complex CC320 (2005–2009: 8.6%; 2011–2015: 56.1%; 2016–2017: 66.5%). Conclusion We observed an expansion of MDR-CC320 among invasive Spn19A strains after PCV10 introduction in Brazil, probably related to a combination of factors, such as vaccination and antimicrobial pressure. Continued surveillance of Spn19A strains is necessary to monitor the sustainability of this clonal complex in the Brazilian population."
https://openalex.org/W2902327385,"Nitrogen fixation provides bioavailable nitrogen, supporting global ecosystems and influencing global cycles of other elements. It provides an additional source of nitrogen to organisms at a cost of lower growth efficiency, largely due to respiratory control of intra-cellular oxygen. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria can, however, utilize both dinitrogen gas and fixed nitrogen, decreasing energetic costs. Here we present an idealized metabolic model of the heterotrophic nitrogen fixer Azotobacter vinelandii which, constrained by laboratory data, provides quantitative predictions for conditions under which the organism uses either ammonium or nitrogen fixation, or both, as a function of the relative supply rates of carbohydrate, fixed nitrogen as well as the ambient oxygen concentration. The model reveals that the organism respires carbohydrate in excess of energetic requirements even when nitrogen fixation is inhibited and respiratory protection is not essential. The use of multiple nitrogen source expands the potential niche and range for nitrogen fixation. The model provides a quantitative framework which can be employed in ecosystem and biogeochemistry models."
https://openalex.org/W2902341252,"The urban environment has been criticized for promoting 'nature-deficit' and 'child-nature disconnectedness'. Keeping in mind the importance of nature exposure and its extensive health benefits, many environmental programs around the world hope to (re)connect children with nature. To evaluate the effectiveness of such efforts, valid tools to measure Connectedness to Nature (CN) are needed but do not exist today, especially for use with pre-schoolers.The original CN Index was modified and tested among the Parents of Preschool Children (CNI-PPC) in an urban setting (Hong Kong) for its internal consistency (n = 299) and external validity (n = 194). The 'Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire' (SDQ) was chosen for divergent and convergent analysis. Conventional recommendations for test adaptation and translation were used.Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed that the 16-item scale adequately captured four major dimensions: enjoyment of nature, empathy for nature, responsibility toward nature, and awareness of nature (Cronbach's α were respectively .86, .87, .75 and .80). When tested against the SDQ, a validated measure for child psychological functioning, and identification of children's problem behaviours, three CNI-PPC factors influenced the SDQ outcomes: (1) the more enjoyment of nature children displayed the less overall distress and impairment they exhibited (β = -.64); (2) greater responsibility toward nature in children was associated with less hyperactivity (β = -.50), fewer behavioural and peer difficulties (β = -.62 and β = -.65 respectively) and improved prosocial behaviour (β = .77); (3) the more aware children were of nature, the less emotional difficulties they exhibited (β = -.51). The variance explained was large (range R2 = .42 to .80).Thus, CNI-PPC factors have meaningful and substantive associations with the strengths and difficulties parents perceive in their children. This indicates that the CNI-PPC is a valid and reliable instrument to measure CN at an age when children cannot respond for themselves. Further, this simple tool can help researchers/practitioners to better understand how connectedness to nature affects child psychological functioning and wellbeing.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02715544.

https://openalex.org/W2903468337,"Digestion of milk proteins in the premature infant stomach releases functional peptides; however, which peptides are present has not been reported. Premature infants are often fed a combination of human milk and bovine milk fortifiers, but the variety of functional peptides released from both human and bovine milk proteins remains uncharacterized. This study applied peptidomics to investigate the peptides released in gastric digestion of mother’s milk proteins and supplemental bovine milk proteins in premature infants. Peptides were assessed for homology against a database of known functional peptides—Milk Bioactive Peptide Database. The peptidomic data were analyzed to interpret which proteases most likely released them from the parent protein. We identified 5,264 unique peptides from bovine and human milk proteins within human milk, fortifier or infant gastric samples. Plasmin was predicted to be the most active protease in milk, while pepsin or cathepsin D were predicted to be most active in the stomach. Alignment of the peptide distribution showed a different digestion pattern between human and bovine proteins. The number of peptides with high homology to known functional peptides (antimicrobial, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, etc.) increased from milk to the premature infant stomach and was greater from bovine milk proteins than human milk proteins. The differential release of bioactive peptides from human and bovine milk proteins may impact overall health outcomes in premature infants."
https://openalex.org/W2902950579,"Mycobacterium abscessus is an important infectious agent highly associated with drug resistance and treatment failure. We investigated the drug resistance situation of M. abscessus in Northeast Thailand and the possible genetic basis for this. Sixty-eight M. abscessus clinical isolates were obtained from 26 patients at Srinagarind Hospital during 2012-2016. Drug susceptibility tests and sequencing of erm(41), rrl and rrs genes were performed. Mycobacterium abscessus was resistant to 11/15 antibiotics (nearly 100% resistance in each case). Partial susceptibility to four antibiotics was found (amikacin, tigecycline, clarithromycin and linezolid). Non-massiliense subspecies were significantly associated with clarithromycin resistance (p<0.0001) whereas massiliense subspecies were associated with tigecycline resistance (p = 0.028). Inducible clarithromycin resistance was seen in 22/68 (32.35%) isolates: 21 of these isolates (95.45%) belonged to non-massiliense subspecies and resistance was explicable by the T28C mutation in erm(41). Inducible clarithromycin resistance was found in one isolate of the massiliense subspecies. Acquired clarithromycin resistance explicable by the A2271G/C mutation of rrl was seen in only 7/16 (43.75%) of strains. Inducible and acquired resistance mechanisms can be interchangeable during the course of infection. Rrs mutations were not associated with amikacin resistance in our study. Antibiotic resistance in subspecies of M. abscessus was reported from Northeast Thailand. Known resistance-associated mutations cannot explain all of the resistance patterns observed."
https://openalex.org/W2903495686,"Background China adopted family doctor (FD) to help achieve “Healthy China 2030” through providing continuous, comprehensive, and life-cycle contract services. However, there is a disparity between actual and targeted FD use, as residents continue to visit specialists in large hospitals. The government implemented initiatives to improve residents’ willingness to sign up with and visit their FDs. Factors that influence contract behavior are therefore significant for frontier policy research. Methods Two survey waves were conducted in Shanghai (2013 and 2016). The first wave included 2754 people and the second 1995 people. Exploratory factor analysis was used to synthesize “satisfaction” as a predictor of contract behavior. Pearson’s chi-square, pooled and logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between influencing factors and contract behavior, and clarify variations in factors across the two waves. Results Four factors were extracted from 15 satisfaction items: “Treatment Environment,” “Medical Technology,” “Service Specification” and “Service Attitude”. Consistent with descriptive analysis, longitudinal analysis showed sociodemographic characteristics (age, education, marital status, and hukou) were significant predictors of contract behavior. The odds ratio of non-communicable diseases (NCD) patients for contract behavior was 2.218 times that of residents without NCD. Contract behavior was positively correlated with awareness of FD services (OR = 21.674, 95%CI = 15.043–31.229), satisfaction with Service Attitude (OR = 1.210, 95%CI = 1.009–1.451), and visit compliance (OR = 1.959, 95%CI = 1.564–2.452). Over time, the odds ratios of the married, Shanghai hukou, NCD, and awareness of FD services declined from 0.456, 1.795, 2.492, 28.690 to 0.443, 1.678, 1.910 and 14.031 respectively, while those of age, and visit compliance increased from 1.027, 1.521 to 1.041 and 2.305 respectively. In 2016, an education-contract gradient had formed (the higher the education level, the higher probability of signing with a FD), whereas high school education had the highest odds ratio (OR = 1.163,95%CI = 0.740–1.827) in 2013. Service Attitude was the only significant satisfaction-related predictor (OR = 1.358, 95%CI = 1.001–1.842) in 2016, compared with “Treatment Environment” (OR = 1.224, 95%CI = 1.001–1.496) and “Service Specification” in 2013(OR = 1.270, 95%CI = 1.040–1.552). Conclusions Except for the socio-demographic variables, NCD, awareness of FD services, satisfaction and visit compliance were significant predictors of contract behavior with FDs. The effect of visit compliance had increased over time while NCD and awareness of FD services were losing impact over time. Significant satisfaction factors had also changed from “Treatment Environment” and “Service Specification” to “Service Attitude”."

We use Danish administrative register data to study the impact of medical treatment of ADHD on children’s academic performance assessed by student grade point average (GPA). Using administrative register data on children, who begin medical treatment, we conduct a natural experiment and exploit plausible exogenous variation in medical nonresponse to estimate the effect of medical treatment on school-leaving GPA. We find significant effects of treatment on both exam and teacher evaluated GPAs: Compared to consistent treatment, part or full discontinuation of treatment has large significant negative effects reducing teacher evaluation and exam GPA with .18 and .22 standard deviations, respectively. The results demonstrate that medical treatment may mitigate the negative social consequences of ADHD. Placebo regressions indicate that a causal interpretation of our findings is plausible."
https://openalex.org/W2902157183,"Repeated use of field corn (Zea mays L.) hybrids expressing the Cry3Bb1 and mCry3A traits in Nebraska has selected for field-evolved resistance in some western corn rootworm (WCR; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte) populations. Therefore, this study was conducted to characterize spatial variation in local WCR susceptibility to Cry3Bb1 and mCry3A traits in Keith and Buffalo counties, Nebraska, and determine the relationship between past management practices and current WCR susceptibility. Adult WCR populations were collected from sampling grids during 2015 and 2016 and single-plant larval bioassays conducted with F1 progeny documented significant variation in WCR susceptibility to Cry3Bb1 and mCry3A on different spatial scales in both sampling grids. At the local level, results revealed that neighboring cornfields may support WCR populations with very different susceptibility levels, indicating that gene flow of resistant alleles from high trait survival sites is not inundating large areas. A field history index, comprised of additive and weighted variables including past WCR management tactics and agronomic practices, was developed to quantify relative selection pressure in individual fields. The field history index-Cry3 trait survivorship relationship from year 1 data was highly predictive of year 2 Cry3 trait survivorship when year 2 field history indices were inserted into the year 1 base model. Sensitivity analyses indicated years of trait use and associated selection pressure at the local level were the key drivers of WCR susceptibility to Cry3 traits in this system. Retrospective case histories from this study will inform development of optimal resistance management programs and increase understanding of plant-insect interactions that may occur when transgenic corn is deployed in the landscape. Results from this study also support current recommendations to slow or mitigate the evolution of resistance by using a multi-tactic approach to manage WCR densities in individual fields within an integrated pest management framework."
https://openalex.org/W2788518899,"Trade networks, across which countries distribute their products, are crucial components of the globalized world economy. Their structure is strongly heterogeneous across products, given the different features of the countries which buy and sell goods. By using a diversified pool of indicators from network science and product complexity theory, we quantitatively confirm the intuition that, overall, products with higher complexity -- i.e., with larger technological content and number of components -- are traded through a more centralized network -- i.e., with a small number of countries concentrating most of the export flow. Since centralized networks are known to be more vulnerable, we argue that the current composition of production and trading is associated to high fragility at the level of the most complex -- thus strategic -- products."

Second the same volunteers received 108 pfu HIV-MVA twice, alone or combined with CN54rgp140/GLA-AF, intramuscularly by syringe, 16 weeks apart. Additionally, 20 volunteers received saline placebo.Vaccinations and electroporation did not raise safety concerns. After the last vaccination, the overall IFN-γ ELISpot response rate to either Gag or Env was 97%. Intradermal electroporation significantly increased ELISpot response rates to HIV-DNA-specific Gag (66% group I vs. 86% group II, p = 0.026), but not to the HIV-MVA vaccine-specific Gag or Env peptide pools nor the magnitude of responses. Co-administration of rgp140/GLA-AF with HIV-MVA did not impact the frequency of binding antibody responses against subtype B gp160, C gp140 or E gp120 antigens (95%, 99%, 79%, respectively), but significantly enhanced the magnitude against subtype B gp160 (2700 versus 300, p<0.001) and subtype C gp140 (24300 versus 2700, p<0.001) Env protein. At relatively low titers, neutralizing antibody responses using the TZM-bl assay were more frequent in vaccinees given adjuvanted protein boost.Intradermal electroporation increased DNA-induced Gag response rates but did not show an impact on Env-specific responses nor on the magnitude of responses. Co-administration of HIV-MVA with rgp140/GLA-AF significantly enhanced antibody responses."
https://openalex.org/W2903237209,"Chronic lung infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. This is associated with the conversion of the non-mucoid to the mucoid phenotype. However, there is little information about the occurrence of alginate-producing P. aeruginosa in CF patients outside Europe and North America. The aim of the present study was to investigate mutations in the algTmucABD operon in mucoid and non-mucoid isolates from Brazilian CF patients. Twenty-seven mucoid and 37 non-mucoid isolates from 40 CF patients chronically infected by P. aeruginosa attending a CF reference center in Brazil were evaluated by sequence analysis. Mutations in mucA were observed in 93% of the mucoid isolates and 54% of the non-mucoid isolates. Among these non-mucoid isolates, 55% were considered revertants, since they also had mutations in algT (algU). Most isolates associated with moderate alginate production presented point mutations in mucB and/or mucD. We identified 30 mutations not previously described in the operon. In conclusion, mutations in mucA were the main mechanism of conversion to mucoidy, and most of the non-mucoid isolates were revertants, but the mechanism of revertance is not fully explained by changes in algT."
https://openalex.org/W2903008452,"There is little information about environmental contamination with antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in Sub-Saharan Africa, home to about 1 billion people. In this study we measured the abundance of three genes (sul1, sul2, and intI1) used as indicators of environmental contamination with ARGs in the sediments of four urban wetlands in southwestern Nigeria by qPCR. In addition, we characterised the variable regions of class 1 integrons in sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TRI)-resistant bacteria isolated from the wetlands by PCR and DNA sequencing. The indicator ARGs were present in all wetlands with mean absolute copy numbers/gram of sediment ranging between 4.7x106 and 1.2x108 for sul1, 1.1x107 and 1x108 for sul2, and 5.3x105 and 1.9x107 for intI1. The relative abundances (ARG/16S rRNA copy number) ranged from about 10-3 to 10-1. These levels of ARG contamination were similar to those previously reported for polluted environments in other parts of the world. The integrase genes intI1 and intI2 were detected in 72% and 11.4% SMX/TRI-resistant isolates, respectively. Five different cassette array types (dfrA7; aadA2; aadA1|dfrA1; acc(6')lb-cr|arr3|dfrA27; arr3|acc(6')lb-cr|dfrA27) were detected among 34 (59.6%) intI1-positive isolates. No gene cassettes were found in the nine intI2-positive isolates. These results show that African urban ecosystems impacted by anthropogenic activities are reservoirs of bacteria harbouring transferable ARG."
https://openalex.org/W2902936442,"Background Despite the improvements in diagnostic tools for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi in human blood samples, the isolation of parasite from bloodstream in the chronic phase of Chagas disease is challenging. Thus, there is an increasing interest in the development of strategies that allow an accurate monitoring of the parasite load in bloodstream of Chagas disease patients. Given that, the comparison of a classical diagnostic method such as blood culture and multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was few explored so far. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the detection and quantification of T. cruzi load in the circulating blood of patients with chronic Chagas disease, using blood culture and qPCR techniques. Methods⁄Principal findings The multiplex real-time quantitative PCR assay (qPCR) based on TaqMan technology was evaluated in 135 blood samples from 91 patients with chronic Chagas disease presenting indeterminate (asymptomatic, n = 23) and cardiac (chronic cardiomyopathy, n = 68) forms, in comparison with the classical blood culture (BC) technique. The total positivity of qPCR and BC was 58.5% and 49.6%, respectively. The median parasite load of all positive patients was 1.18 [0.39–4.23] par. eq.⁄mL, ranging from 0.01 to 116.10 par. eq.⁄mL. We did not find significant differences between T. cruzi load with age and distinct clinical manifestations of patients. Conclusions/Significance Our data suggest that qPCR can be an auxiliary tool for studies that require T. cruzi isolation from the bloodstream of patients with chronic Chagas disease, after the establishment of a parasite load cut-off that guarantees a relative success rate of parasite isolation using BC technique."
https://openalex.org/W2902486188,"Climate change and extreme temperatures pose increasing challenges to individuals and their health with older adults being one of the most vulnerable groups. The aim of this paper is to better understand the roles that tangible assets (e.g., physical or financial) and intangible assets (e.g., human or social) play in the way older adults adapt to extreme temperatures, the types of adaptive responses they implement, limits and constraints, as well opportunities for better adaptation. Rather than focusing exclusively on extremes of heat, or considering each type of asset in isolation, the important and novel contribution of this paper is to take an integrated and multi-seasonal qualitative and quantitative approach, that conjointly investigates all categories of assets in relation to the adaptations that independently-living older adults make to both extreme heat and extreme cold.The paper examines the contribution of assets to adaptation to extreme temperatures among older adults living independently in their homes. An innovative mixed methods study with an inter-seasonal approach was implemented in Lisbon, Portugal with interviews and surveys during summer for extreme heat and winter for extreme cold. The ability of participants to adapt to extreme temperatures was found to be dependent on asset context and diversity, and the dynamics through which extreme temperatures enhanced or reduced the stock of assets available. As a result, participants engaged in activities of assets replacement, exchange or substitutions. Despite this, many participants recognised many constraints and limits to their ability to adapt and protect their health and well-being ranging from reduced income, high energy costs and lack of social networks. Opportunities for improving older adults' adaptation were found to exist and strategies, action and investment have been identified by older adults which included life-long education, incentives to improve insulation and local activities.The paper suggests that the implementation of the proposed asset-based approach linking assets and adaptation to extreme temperatures, illustrates the key pathway that individuals, their families and carers, governments, policymakers, researchers and practitioners can follow to ensure effective adaptation and promote health and well-being. Supporting older adults' adaptation to extreme temperatures is possible and can be complemented with efforts to reduce older adults' vulnerability and building resilience to extreme temperatures. These findings pose concrete implications for policy and practice, including for example the need for implementation of measures and actions to reduce poverty, reduce energy costs, improve the quality of the housing stock and improve older adults' social networks."
https://openalex.org/W2902993023,"Ureteroscopy is an endoscopic kidney stone removal procedure which increases the internal pressure in the renal pelvis, the kidney's urinary collecting system. Elevated renal pelvic pressure may result in systemic absorption of irrigation fluid and urine, which can increase the risk of postoperative fever and sepsis. Urologists have investigated the effects of various surgical parameters on the renal pelvic pressure. However, it still remains unknown which surgical parameter has the most dominant effect on the renal pelvic pressure over time. Here we develop a physical model that computes the renal pelvic pressure as a function of time based on parameters that can be varied during ureteroscopy. The model is developed by applying pipe network analysis to the regions of the urinary tract that are involved in a representative ureteroscopic procedure. Our model unifies the findings of the previously published studies on this topic; an ex-vivo porcine study and an in-vivo human study. Furthermore it allows simulation of surgical procedures based on various techniques. Our simulation demonstrates that the two strong regulators of renal pelvis pressure during ureteroscopy are the size of the gap between ureteroscope and ureteral access sheath and the frequency and duration of ureteroscope withdrawal."
https://openalex.org/W2902294534,"Objective People with schizophrenia face an increased risk of premature death from chronic diseases and injury. This study describes the trajectory of acute care health service use in the last year of life for people with schizophrenia and how this varied with receipt of community-based specialist palliative care and morbidity burden. Method A population-based retrospective matched cohort study of people who died from 01/01/2009 to 31/12/2013 with and without schizophrenia in Western Australia. Hospital inpatient, emergency department, death and community-based care data collections were linked at the person level. Rates of emergency department presentations and hospital admissions over the last year of life were estimated. Results Of the 63508 decedents, 1196 (1.9%) had a lifetime history of schizophrenia. After adjusting for confounders and averaging over the last year of life there was no difference in the overall rate of ED presentation between decedents with schizophrenia and the matched cohort (HR 1.09; 95%CI 0.99–1.19). However, amongst the subset of decedents with cancer, choking or intentional self-harm recorded on their death certificate, those with schizophrenia presented to ED more often. Males with schizophrenia had the highest rates of emergency department use in the last year of life. Rates of hospital admission for decedents with schizophrenia were on average half (HR 0.53, 95%CI 0.44–0.65) that of the matched cohort although this varied by cause of death. Of all decedents with cancer, 27.5% of people with schizophrenia accessed community-based specialist palliative care compared to 40.4% of the matched cohort (p<0.001). Rates of hospital admissions for decedents with schizophrenia increased 50% (95% CI: 10%-110%) when enrolled in specialist palliative care. Conclusion In the last year of life, people with schizophrenia were less likely to be admitted to hospital and access community-based speciality palliative care, but more likely to attend emergency departments if male. Community-based specialist palliative care was associated with increased rates of hospital admissions."
https://openalex.org/W2902478845,"Background Chlamydia trachomatis is the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the world. Approximately 80% of infected women are asymptomatic, although this infection can lead to serious complications in the female reproductive tract. Few data on Chlamydia infection are available in rural Amazonian communities. Objectives To evaluate the prevalence of sexual C. trachomatis infection in women from Marajó Archipelago communities in the Amazon region of Brazil and to identify associated factors and genotypes. Methods We utilized amplification of the ompA gene by nested PCR. Positive samples were genotyped by sequencing. Study participants completed a questionnaire on social, epidemiological, and reproductive health variables. A Poisson regression was used to evaluate the degree of association of these variables with the infection. Results The sexual infection by C. trachomatis was observed in 4% (16/393) of the subjects, and was more often found in women aged ≤25 (14.3%; 95% CI = 2.83–35.47; p <0.001), and in women with a household income of less than one Brazilian monthly minimum wage (5.2%; 95% CI = 1.33–11.37; p = 0.014). The ompA gene was sequenced in 13 samples, revealing F genotypes (38.4%, n = 5), D (23%, n = 3), E (15.3%, n = 2), Ia (7.6%, N = 1), J (7.6%, n = 1) and B (7.6%, n = 1). Conclusions We recorded a high prevalence of sexual infection by C. trachomatis in young and poor women from the interior of the Brazilian Amazon. This high prevalence and the frequencies of the main genotypes were similar to those found in major Brazilian urban centers. Our results reinforce the importance of the screening of this neglected infection, and the prevention of later sequelae in young women from rural and urban areas of Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W2902316700,"Background Sub-Saharan Africa, including Zambia, has experienced an increase in overweight and obesity due to rapid lifestyle changes associated with recent economic growth. We explored the prevalence and correlates of overweight and obesity in rural Zambia. We also investigated the role of self-perception of body weight in weight control given the local socio-cultural context. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 690 residents of the Mumbwa district aged 25–64 years through a multistage, clustered, household random sampling. We administered a questionnaire and collected anthropometric and bio-behavioral data from May to July 2016. Factors associated with body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2 and underestimation of body weight were assessed using multiple logistic regression. Results Of the weighted sample of 689 participants (335 men and 354 women), 185 (26.8%) had BMI ≥25 kg/m2. In multivariate analyses, female gender, age 45–64 years, tertiary education, higher fruit and vegetable intake, high blood pressure, abnormal blood lipid profile, and Hemoglobin A1c ≥5.7% were significantly associated with BMI ≥25 kg/m2. Among participants with BMI ≥25 kg/m2, 14.2% and 58.2% perceived themselves as being underweight and normal weight, respectively. Age 45–64 years was the only factor significantly associated with body weight underestimation. Preference for obesity was reported by 17.5% and 3.6% of respondents with BMI <25 kg/m2 and BMI≥25 kg/m2, respectively; “looks attractive” and “fear of being perceived as HIV-positive” were the main reasons. Conclusion In rural Zambia, overweight and obesity are prevalent and significantly associated with alterations in blood pressure, blood lipid profile, and glucose metabolism. However, most subjects with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 underestimated their body weight; some preferred obesity, in part due to cultural factors and HIV-related stigma. A health promotion program that addresses such perceptions and body weight underestimation should be urgently introduced in Zambia."
https://openalex.org/W2902953424,"To assess the reproducibility of adverse event evaluation by a medical record review committee.Cross-sectional reanalysis of medical records.Reviewers re-examined fifty medical records of deceased patients regarding the presence of adverse events, their potential preventability and their possible contribution to death. Also we investigated the root causes of the preventable AEs. Differences between the first and second assessment were calculated.The Kappa on the presence of an adverse event was 0.64 and 0.32 for the potential preventability. The intrarater agreement showed a Kappa of 0.61 on the adverse event presence and 0.64 for the potential preventability. Interrater agreement showed a Kappa of 0.66 for the adverse event presence and 0.03 for the potential preventability.We found a fair reproducibility for the detection of adverse events, but a poor reproducibility for the potential preventability. Possibly this was caused by lack of a definition for the preventability of adverse events. We think giving feedback to professionals using the results of medical record review remains valuable, but an improvement of its reproducibility is essential. To our opinion an international consensus on what exactly constitutes preventability of adverse events and agreement on a definition is necessary. This would result in more comparable studies in this field and could then be more informative on the ideal procedure to avoid certain potentially preventable adverse events in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2902592978,"Objectives To objectively assess pupillary involvement according to various etiologies of acquired isolated third nerve palsy using automated pupillometry, and evaluate the efficacy of digital pupillometry in discriminating compressive lesions from microvascular ischemic third nerve palsy. Design Retrospective, observational case series Methods A total of 171 subjects were included in this study, consisting of 60 subjects with presumed microvascular ischemic third nerve palsy, 51 with non-ischemic third nerve palsy, and 60 controls whose pupillary light responses were measured using a dynamic automated pupillometer. Subjects with non-ischemic third nerve palsy were divided into subgroups according to their etiology; inflammatory and compressive groups including tumor and aneurysm. Pupillometry parameters including minimum and maximum pupil diameters, constriction latency and ratio, maximum and average constriction velocities and dilation velocity were noted. The diagnostic ability of pupillometry parameters for discriminating compressive vs microvascular ischemic third nerve palsy was evaluated. The inter-eye difference of the involved eye and the uninvolved fellow eye was calculated to adjust for individual variability. Results Among all parameters, reduced pupillary constriction ratio was the most specific parameter for detecting non-ischemic third nerve palsy, as a large inter-eye difference beyond the normative range of controls was found in 0% of ischemic, 20% of inflammatory and 60% of compressive third nerve palsy. With the diagnostic criteria using inter-eye differences of 1) minimum pupil diameter > 0.45 mm, or 2) pupillary constriction ratio < -7.5% compared to the fellow eye, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing compressive third nerve palsy were 95% and 88%, respectively. In the compressive group, positive correlations were found between the degree of external ophthalmoplegia and constriction ratio (r = 0.615, p<0.001), average constriction velocity (r = 0.591, p = 0.001) and maximum constriction velocity (r = 0.582, p = 0.001). Conclusions Abnormal pupillary constriction ratio was highly specific for detecting compressive third nerve palsy, although the sensitivity was not high. Digital pupillometry demonstrated relatively good performance for discriminating compressive lesions from microvascular ischemic third nerve palsy."
https://openalex.org/W2903157013,"Community dwelling stroke survivors most often fall while walking. Understanding how post-stroke individuals control mediolateral footpath during walking may help elucidate the mechanisms that contribute to walking instability. By applying the Uncontrolled Manifold (UCM) approach, we investigated (1) how post-stroke individuals coordinate lower-extremity joint motions to stabilize mediolateral footpath of the swing leg, and (2) how the inter-joint coordination in footpath stabilization correlates to their walking stability. Nine stroke subjects and nine healthy controls walked on a treadmill at four different speeds. UCM analysis partitions the variance of kinematic configurations across gait cycles into “good variance” (i.e., the variance component leading to a consistent footpath) or “bad variance” (i.e., the variance component leading to an inconsistent footpath). We found that both groups had a significantly greater “good” than “bad” variance (p<0.05) for most of the swing phase, suggesting that mediolateral footpath is an important variable stabilized by the central nervous system during walking. Stroke subjects had significantly greater relative variance difference (ΔV) (i.e. normalized difference between “good” and “bad” variance) (p<0.05), indicating a stronger kinematic synergy in footpath stabilization, than the controls. In addition, the kinematic synergy in mediolateral footpath stabilization is strongest during mid-swing but weakest during late swing in healthy gait. However, this phase-dependent strategy is preserved for mid-swing but not for late swing in stroke gait. Moreover, stroke and healthy subjects demonstrated different relationships between UCM and walking stability measures. A stronger kinematic synergy in healthy gait is associated with better walking stability whereas having more “good variance” or stronger kinematic synergy in stroke gait is associated with less walking stability. The current findings suggest that walking with too much “good variance” in people following stroke, despite no effect on the footpath, may adversely affect their walking stability to some extent."
https://openalex.org/W2900713258,"Recently, emergence of signaling conventions, among which language is a prime example, draws a considerable interdisciplinary interest ranging from game theory, to robotics to evolutionary linguistics. Such a wide spectrum of research is based on much different assumptions and methodologies, but complexity of the problem precludes formulation of a unifying and commonly accepted explanation. We examine formation of signaling conventions in a framework of a multi-agent reinforcement learning model. When the network of interactions between agents is a complete graph or a sufficiently dense random graph, a global consensus is typically reached with the emerging language being a nearly unique object-word mapping or containing some synonyms and homonyms. On finite-dimensional lattices, the model gets trapped in disordered configurations with a local consensus only. Such a trapping can be avoided by introducing a population renewal, which in the presence of superlinear reinforcement restores an ordinary surface-tension driven coarsening and considerably enhances formation of efficient signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2902119517,"Cancer cells depend on glucose metabolism via glycolysis as a primary energy source, despite the presence of oxygen and fully functioning mitochondria, in order to promote growth, proliferation and longevity. Glycolysis relies upon NAD+ to accept electrons in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) reaction, linking the redox state of the cytosolic NAD+ pool to glycolytic rate. The free cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio is involved in over 700 oxidoreductive enzymatic reactions and as such, the NAD+/NADH ratio is regarded as a metabolic readout of overall cellular redox state. Many experimental techniques that monitor or measure total NAD+ and NADH are unable to distinguish between protein-bound and unbound forms. Yet total NAD+/NADH measurements yield little information, since it is the free forms of NAD+ and NADH that determine the kinetic and thermodynamic influence of redox potential on glycolytic rate. Indirect estimations of free NAD+/NADH are based on the lactate/pyruvate (L/P) ratio at chemical equilibrium, but these measurements are often undermined by high lability. To elucidate the sensitivity of the free NAD+/NADH ratio to changes in extracellular substrate, an in silico model of hepatocarcinoma glycolysis was constructed and validated against in vitro data. Model simulations reveal that over experimentally relevant concentrations, changes in extracellular glucose and lactate concentration during routine cancer cell culture can lead to significant deviations in the NAD+/NADH ratio. Based on the principles of chemical equilibrium, the model provides a platform from which experimentally challenging situations may be examined, suggesting that extracellular substrates play an important role in cellular redox and bioenergetic homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2902550973,"Overexpression of the Dual-specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation-Regulated Kinase 1A (DYRK1A) gene contributes to the retardation, craniofacial anomalies, cognitive impairment, and learning and memory deficits associated with Down Syndrome (DS). DCAF7/HAN11/WDR68 (hereafter WDR68) binds DYRK1A and is required for craniofacial development. Accumulating evidence suggests DYRK1A-WDR68 complexes enable proper growth and patterning of multiple organ systems and suppress inappropriate cell growth/transformation by regulating the balance between proliferation and differentiation in multiple cellular contexts. Here we report, using engineered mouse C2C12 and human HeLa cell lines, that WDR68 is required for normal levels of DYRK1A. However, Wdr68 does not significantly regulate Dyrk1a mRNA expression levels and proteasome inhibition did not restore DYRK1A in cells lacking Wdr68 (Δwdr68 cells). Overexpression of WDR68 increased DYRK1A levels while overexpression of DYRK1A had no effect on WDR68 levels. We further report that WDR68 is similarly required for normal levels of the closely related DYRK1B kinase and that both DYRK1A and DYRK1B are essential for the transition from proliferation to differentiation in C2C12 cells. These findings reveal an additional role of WDR68 in DYRK1A-WDR68 and DYRK1B-WDR68 complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2903321490,"Blood-sucking insects are responsible for the transmission of several important disease-causing organisms such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoans. The hematophagous hemipteran Rhodnius prolixus is one of the most important vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Due to the medical importance of this insect, it has been used as a study model in physiology and biochemistry since the 1930s. Artificial feeding has been recognized as a feasible and a more ethical alternative method of feeding these hematophagous insects. To prevent clotting after blood collection defibrination or treatment with anticoagulants are necessary. Although anticoagulants have been routinely used for stabilizing the collected blood, there is a gap in demonstration of the effects of using anticoagulants on the feeding and development of the hematophagous insect Rhodnius prolixus. In this study, we compared the survival rate, molting efficiency, fertility, and infection development between insects that were fed on blood containing three different anticoagulants (citrate, EDTA, and heparin). We observed that fifth instar nymphs that were fed on blood containing EDTA and citrate could not perform digestion properly, which resulted in molting inefficiency. Adult insects that were fed on EDTA-containing blood laid lower number of eggs, and also had a diminished egg hatch percentage. When we delivered T. cruzi parasites in blood containing citrate or EDTA to the insects, a lower number of parasites and metacyclic trypomastigotes was observed in the intestine compared to the group fed on heparin-containing blood. Since heparin could potentially inhibit DNA polymerase activity in DNA samples extracted from the intestine, we analyzed different heparin concentrations to determine which one is the best for use as an anticoagulant. Concentrations ranging between 2.5 and 5 U/mL were able to inhibit coagulation without severely impairing DNA polymerase activity, thus indicating that this should be considered as the range of use for feeding experiments. Our results suggest that among the three anticoagulants tested, heparin can be recommended as the anticoagulant of choice for R. prolixus feeding experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2902267791,"Objective To evaluate ovarian reserve in women after preservative cesarean delivery using uterine artery embolization due to morbidly adherent placenta. Study design A historical cohort study including all women admitted to a single tertiary care center, with morbidly adherent placenta that had preservative cesarean delivery with bilateral uterine artery embolization. Inclusion criteria included gestational age >24 weeks, singleton pregnancy and placenta increta / percreta. Exclusion criteria included maternal age > 43 years old and cesarean hysterectomy. Control group included women attending the infertility clinic due to male factor or single women conceiving via sperm donation, matched by age. Blood samples were collected on day 2–5 of menstruations for hormonal profile and Anti Mullarian Hormone (AMH) levels. Primary outcome was ovarian reserve evaluated by the levels of AMH. Results 59 women underwent preservative cesarean delivery using uterine artery embolization during the study period. 21 women met inclusion criteria (33.9%) and were matched controls (n = 40). Circulating levels of E2 and FSH did not differ significantly between the two groups (p = 0.665, p = 0.396, respectively). AMH was lower in the study group (median 0.8 IQR 0.44–1.80) compared to the controls (median 2.08 IQR 1.68–3.71) (p = 0.001). This finding was consistent in linear multivariate regression analysis where the group of cesarean delivery using bilateral artery embolization due to placenta accrete was significantly predictive for the levels of AMH (B = -1.308, p = 0.012). Conclusion Women post preservative cesarean delivery using uterine artery embolization due to placenta accrete have lower ovarian reserve compare to controls matched by age."
https://openalex.org/W2902277120,"Recent developments in the social epidemiological literature indicate that health inequalities between the employed and the unemployed are widening in many advanced capitalist countries. At present, we know relatively little about why these inequalities are worsening. Drawing on nationally-representative data from the largest health survey in Canada, we explored this question by analyzing changes in self-rated health inequalities between employed and unemployed Canadians from 2000 to 2014. Using a regression-based method that decomposes a given inequality into its component sources, we investigated the extent to which risk factors that account for unemployment-related health inequalities at a single point in time can also explain the extent and direction of change in these unemployment-related health inequalities over time. Our results indicate that relative and absolute health inequalities between employed and unemployed Canadians widened over the study period. Between 2000 and 2014, the prevalence of poor self-rated health among unemployed Canadians increased from 10.8% to 14.6%, while rates among employed Canadians were stable at around 6%. Our findings suggest that the demographic, socioeconomic, and proximal risk factors that are routinely used to explain unemployment-related health inequalities may not be as powerful for explaining how and why these inequalities change over time. In the case of unemployment-related health inequalities in Canada, these risk factors explain neither the increasing prevalence of poor self-rated health among the unemployed nor the growing gap between the unemployed and their employed counterparts. We provide several possible explanations for these puzzling findings. We conclude by suggesting that widening health inequalities may be driven by macrosocial trends (e.g. widening income inequality and declining social safety nets) which have changed the meaning and context of unemployment, as well as its associated risk factors, in ways that are not easy to capture using routinely available survey data."
https://openalex.org/W2902605255,"Language processing requires us to integrate incoming linguistic representations with representations of past input, often across intervening words and phrases. This computational situation has been argued to require retrieval of the appropriate representations from memory via a set of features or representations serving as retrieval cues. However, even within in a cue-based retrieval account of language comprehension, both the structure of retrieval cues and the particular computation that underlies direct-access retrieval are still underspecified. Evidence from two event-related brain potential (ERP) experiments that show cue-based interference from different types of linguistic representations during ellipsis comprehension are consistent with an architecture wherein different cue types are integrated, and where the interaction of cue with the recent contents of memory determines processing outcome, including expression of the interference effect in ERP componentry. I conclude that retrieval likely includes a computation where cues are integrated with the contents of memory via a linear weighting scheme, and I propose vector addition as a candidate formalization of this computation. I attempt to account for these effects and other related phenomena within a broader cue-based framework of language processing."
https://openalex.org/W2902616255,"We evaluated the effect of intravesical Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) and BCG maintenance therapy on the prognosis of patients with T0 after repeat transurethral resection of bladder mass (TURBT). This retrospective analysis involved 427 patients who underwent repeat TURBT within 6 weeks after initial TURBT from 2007 to 2016. Repeat TURBT was performed in patients with high-risk criteria. Patients who achieved T0 after repeat TURBT did or did not receive intravesical BCG therapy. Patients were divided into three groups: non-BCG, BCG induction, and BCG maintenance groups. The study included 106 patients who achieved T0 after repeat TURBT. The median follow-up was 63 months. There were no significant differences in T stage among the three groups. High grade ratio (p = 0.001) and concomitant CIS ratio (p = 0.037) were significantly higher in the BCG maintenance than in the other two groups. The recurrence rates in the non-BCG, BCG induction, and BCG maintenance groups were 46.2%, 28.3%, and 19.2%, respectively (p = 0.043). Recurrence-free survival was significantly higher in the BCG maintenance group than in the BCG induction group (p = 0.032). Progression-free survival was also higher in the BCG maintenance group than in the BCG induction group, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.056). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that only intravesical BCG maintenance therapy was significantly associated with recurrence (hazard ratio 0.016, p = 0.016). In high risk NMIBC patients, intravesical BCG maintenance treatment is required even at T0 after repeat TURBT. Intravesical BCG maintenance therapy of patients with T0 after TURBT reduces recurrence."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the corneal epithelial toxicity of PAI in a rabbit eye model using corneal resistance (CR) measurement, which is a good indicator of cell barrier function. Rabbit eyes were administered PAI solution at 4-, 6-, 8-, or 16-fold dilution with physiological saline solution (saline) or saline alone (control), to the conjunctival sac with/without wash-out with saline. Corneal epithelial injury assessed by fluorescein staining and the CR ratio was measured at 10 minutes (min) to 96 hours (h) after the initial administration. Histological observation was performed in the eyes following the PAI or control administrations. At 120 min after administration of PAI solution, the CR ratio was decreased and superficial punctate keratopathy (SPK) was significantly increased in each of the PAI-administered groups compared to the control. Recovery of CR and SPK after administration of 6- or 8-fold dilution of PAI was significantly delayed in eyes that were not subsequently washed with saline compared with eyes that were. Pre- or post-instillation of 2% rebamipide ophthalmic suspension significantly reduced PAI induced-SPK and -decrease of CR ratio. The CR method was able to accurately and quantitatively evaluate fine corneal epithelial injury. It is suggested that eyes should be washed with saline solution after administration of PAI solution or the instillation of rebamipide to prevent or reduce corneal epithelial injury."
https://openalex.org/W2903142750,"Most patients with chronic lower back pain (CLBP) exhibit degenerative disc disease. Disc specimens obtained during initial therapeutic discectomies are often infected/colonized with Propionibacterium acnes, a Gram-positive commensal of the human skin. Although pain associated with infection is typically ascribed to the body’s inflammatory response, the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus was recently observed to directly activate nociceptors by secreting pore-forming α-hemolysins that disrupt neuronal cell membranes. The hemolytic activity of P. acnes in cultured disc specimens obtained during routine therapeutic discectomies was assessed through incubation on sheep-blood agar. The β-hemolysis pattern displayed by P. acnes on sheep-blood agar was variable and phylogroup-dependent. Their molecular phylogroups were correlated with their hemolytic patterns. Our findings raise the possibility that pore-forming proteins contribute to the pathogenesis and/or symptomology of chronic P. acnes disc infections and CLBP, at least in a subset of cases."
https://openalex.org/W2903200388,"Many link prediction methods have been developed to infer unobserved links or predict missing links based on the observed network structure that is always incomplete and subject to interfering noise. Thus, the performance of existing methods is usually limited in that their computation depends only on input graph structures, and they do not consider external information. The effects of social influence and homophily suggest that both network structure and node attribute information should help to resolve the task of link prediction. This work proposes SASNMF, a link prediction unified framework based on non-negative matrix factorization that considers not only graph structure but also the internal and external auxiliary information, which refers to both the node attributes and the structural latent feature information extracted from the network. Furthermore, three different combinations of internal and external information are proposed and input into the framework to solve the link prediction problem. Extensive experimental results on thirteen real networks, five node attribute networks and eight non-attribute networks show that the proposed framework has competitive performance compared with benchmark methods and state-of-the-art methods, indicating the superiority of the presented algorithm."

Methods Anesthetized, splenectomized domestic swine underwent hepatic lobar hemitransection. Lactated Ringers was given at 150 or 20 mL/min IV (rapid vs. slow, respectively, N = 12 per group; limit of 100 mL/kg). Primary endpoints were blood loss and serum hemoglobin; secondary endpoints included survival, vital signs, coagulation parameters, and blood gases. Results The slow group had a less blood loss (1.6 vs. 2.7 L, respectively) and a higher final hemoglobin concentration (6.0 vs. 3.4 g/dL). Conclusions Using a fixed volume of crystalloid resuscitation in this porcine model of uncontrolled intraabdominal hemorrhage, a slow IV infusion rate produced less blood loss and a smaller hemoglobin decrease compared to rapid infusion."
https://openalex.org/W2902428999,"Graduation projects play an important role in computer engineering careers in which students are expected to draw upon their knowledge and skills that were acquired since admission. To manage the activities of graduation projects, an iterative and incremental approach which aims continuous improvement is proposed as an alternative to a controversial delivery model. However, such integration brings up a set of challenges to be taken into account: e.g. multiple project deliveries, more labor-intensive effort from instructors, and ultimately continuous learning for all participants. One promising way to achieve such an integrated and continuous deployment velocity is to eliminate potential bottlenecks by giving student teams to receive early and continuous feedback. To this end, we propose a continuous feedback and delivery mechanism for managing the life-cycle of a graduation project through draft proposal, literature review, requirements gathering, design, implementation and testing which should produce intermediate outputs at predefined intervals. Most importantly, our approach makes it possible to quantify most of the activities involved in life-cycle process with various rubrics (i.e. measurement scales) that have been purposefully developed. The proposed model promotes the fact that all improvements should be monitored, evaluated and documented. The results of this study indicate that students who were managed using this approach produced better project deliverables and ultimately have delivered better and successful projects."
https://openalex.org/W2902460708,"Group-living behavior is taxonomically widespread but rare in spiders. The conventional view is that the main pathways to group-living in spiders are either sub-social, where extended maternal care leads to prolonged sibling association; or communal living, where individuals aggregate to exploit a common resource. Female egg-sac guarding behavior occurs throughout kleptoparasitic spiders in the subfamily Argyrodinae (Theridiidae), while individuals in group-living species cohabit in the resource rich webs of their host spiders. These attributes fit both sub-social and communal routes to group-living, which offers new insights to study the early stages of social evolution. We investigated whether members of kleptoparasitic groups in natural populations comprise related individuals by comparing the population structure of two group-living species, Argyrodes miniaceus and A. cf. fissifrons, and two solitary species, A. fasciatus and Neospintharus trigonum. We found that: (1) genetic-spatial autocorrelation in group-living species was highest among spiders sharing the same host web and declined steeply with increasing distance, but no significant autocorrelation at any scale for solitary species; (2) there was high relatedness among group members in two cases of group-living species, which indicated relatedness was not an adhesive agent in most of the groups, but no high relatedness in solitary species; and (3) the host web boundary was not the sole predictor of genetic structures in group-living species. These results suggest that population genetic structure in the group-living species is caused by limited dispersal of group members that is favored by ecological conditions, including the nature and size of resources. In contrast, the absence of genetic structuring in populations of solitary species indicates a high level of dispersal with individual interactions unlikely to have fitness benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2902107789,"Driven by factors such as an increased reliance on genetically modified crops, government policies, and market forces, the crop mix in South Dakota and elsewhere in the United States has become less diverse and moved toward the production of corn and soybeans as the most predominant cash crops over the past two decades. Coinciding with a reduced complexity of crop rotation practices, the prevalence of mono-cropping has increased and crop chemical usage has changed as well. Overall, the reduced reliance on traditional crop rotation practices for mitigating pests corresponds with an increase in crop acres treated with insecticides, expressed as a proportion of total cropland acres, and referred to in the literature as the extensive usage of insecticides. In this paper, we identify how changing cropping patterns in South Dakota have affected the extensive usage of insecticides, an aspect often overlooked by producers and policy makers. Results indicate that increased corn production has contributed to an increase in the share of cropland acres treated with insecticides at the county level in eastern South Dakota."
https://openalex.org/W2902418143,"The temporal variation of sulfur and metals in core sediments off Kueishantao Islet, a hydrothermal vent site at northeastern Taiwan, was explored to elucidate the changes in submarine hydrothermal emanation over a centennial time scale. The discharge of acidic fluids containing abundant sulfides and dissolved metals results in different concentrations of sulfur and metal accumulating in deposited sediments. In addition to particle size and organic carbon affecting metal contents, the content of total sulfur (TS), which is regarded as an indicator of hydrothermalism, correlates positively and strongly with Fe and other metals; however, it correlates negatively with another index of hydrothermalism, the Al/(Al+Fe+Mn) ratio. The TS content in Core Ks2, the core closest to the vents, increased during 1950-1956, 1968-1970, 1982-1987, 1990-1992, and 2004-2005, but decreased during 1967-1968, 1988-1990, and 1994-1995. The chronological changes in the TS concentration of Cores Ks3 and S2 were very similar to those of Core Ks2 within the aforementioned time spans. The numerous large earthquakes (ML > 5) and typhoons that affect northeastern Taiwan appear to influence hydrothermal emanation and determine the temporal variation of sulfur and metals in sediment cores."
https://openalex.org/W2902784623,"The natural polysaccharides extracted from the pollen of Pinus massoniana (TPPPS) have been shown to be a promising immune adjuvant against several viral chicken diseases. However, the exact mechanism through which TPPPS enhances the host immune response in chicken remains poorly understood. In the current study, chicken peripheral blood lymphocytes were treated with varying concentrations of TPPPS and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, iIL-2 and IL-6 were measured to determine the optimal dose of the polysaccharide. A comparative analysis was subsequently performed between the proteome of lymphocytes subjected to the best treatment conditions and that of untreated cells. Protein identification and quantitation revealed a panel of three up-regulated and seven down-regulated candidates in TPPPS-treated chicken peripheral blood lymphocytes. Further annotation and functional analysis suggested that a number of those protein candidates were involved in the regulation of host innate immune response, inflammation and other immune-related pathways. We believe that our results could serve as a stepping stone for further research on the immune-enhancing properties of TPPPS and other polysaccharide-based immune adjuvants."
https://openalex.org/W2902916284,"Typhoid fever is estimated to cause between 9.9-24.2 million cases and 75,000-208,000 deaths per year globally. Low-income and middle-income countries report the majority of cases, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa. The epidemiology of typhoid fever is poorly understood, particularly in Ghana where there has been no study of the within-country variation. Our objective was to explore and analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of typhoid fever morbidities in Ghana. We used the global and local Moran's indices to uncover the existence of global and local spatial patterns, respectively. Generalized linear autoregressive moving average (glarma) models were developed to explore the overall and regional level temporal patterns of morbidities. The overall index of spatial association was 0.19 (p < 0.001). The global Moran's monthly indices of clustering ranged from ≈ 0 - 0.28, with few non-significant (p > 0.05) estimates. The yearly estimates were all significant (p < 0.001) and ranged from 0.1-0.19, suggesting spatial clustering of typhoid. The local Moran's maps indicated isolated high contributions of clustering within the Upper West and Western regions. The overall and regional level glarma models indicated significant first and second-order serial correlation as well as quarterly trends. These findings can provide relevant epidemiological insight into the spatial and temporal patterns of typhoid epidemiology and useful to complement the development of control strategies by public health managers."
https://openalex.org/W2902253353,"In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), low body mass index (BMI) is associated with high mortality. This relationship in emergently hospitalized CKD patients is unknown. We investigated the association between obesity and short-term mortality in emergently admitted patients with dialysis-independent CKD (DI-CKD) with and without infection. This retrospective cohort study examined Diagnosis Procedure Combination data of 26103 emergently hospitalized DI-CKD patients. Patients were divided into 8 groups according to their BMI and the presence of infectious diseases. The primary outcome was in-hospital death within 100 days. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for baseline characteristics showed that low BMI was associated with the outcome both in infected and in non-infected patients (reference group as non-infected and medium BMI [24-26 kg/m2] group): infected and the lowest BMI (≤20 kg/m2) group, hazard ratio (HR) 1.82 (95% confidence interval 1.51, 2.19); non-infected and the lowest BMI group, 1.39 (1.16, 1.67). When patients were stratified according to presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), patients with DM showed that low BMI was associated with the outcome both in infected and in non-infected patients, whereas in non-DM patients, this relationship was attenuated in the non-infected group. For emergently hospitalized CKD patients with infection, high BMI was associated with lower mortality irrespective of the DM status. For non-infected patients, the effects of obesity for in-hospital mortality were modified by the DM status."
https://openalex.org/W2903554183,"In this study we utilized a large animal model to identify a dose of intravenous busulfan that can cause reversible myelosuppression. Nine baboons (Papio anubis) were treated with IV busulfan at 6.4 (Group A), 8 (Group B), or 9.6 mg/kg (Group C). Peripheral blood counts were measured up to 90 days after treatment and serial bone marrow samples were obtained to analyze CD34+ cell content and colony forming units. Overall, the highest grade of peripheral blood cytopenia was observed 15 days after treatment in all three groups (n = 3/group). In particular, we observed a notable reduction of neutrophil and platelet counts in the blood and the number of marrow CD34+ cells and colony forming units. In contrast, the effect of busulfan on hemoglobin levels was mild. Baboons who received the highest dose of busulfan showed only a 25–35% recovery of marrow CD34+ cells and colony forming units after 90 days of busulfan administration. However, all three groups of animals showed a full recovery of peripheral blood counts and normal marrow cellularity and tri-lineage hematopoiesis after treatment. Notably, all three doses of busulfan were tolerated well without significant extra-medullary toxicity. These results validate the hierarchy of blood cells likely targeted by busulfan, and based on these findings, clinical trials using myelotoxic but not myeloablative doses of intravenous busulfan will be designed for patients with myeloid malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2903561393,"It is well known in aquaculture that hyperthermic perturbations may cause skeleton malformations in fish, but this phenomenon has rarely been documented in wild species. One rare location where thermal pollution has increased the proportion of malformed fish in wild population is in the waters near the Kuosheng Nuclear Power Plant in Taiwan. At this site, the threshold temperature and critical exposure time for inducing deformations have not been previously determined. In addition, it was unclear whether juvenile fish with thermal-induced malformations are able to recover when the temperature returns below the threshold. In the present study, juvenile largescale mullet (Planiliza macrolepis) were kept at temperatures ranging from 26°C and 36°C for 1–4 weeks, after which malformed fish were maintained at a preferred temperature of 26°C for another 8 weeks. The vertebrae bending index (VBI) of fish was increased after 2 weeks at 36°C, and deformed vertebral columns were detected by radiography after 4 weeks. However, malformations were not observed in groups kept at or below 34°C. Moreover, at the end of the recovery period, both the VBI and the vertebrae malformations had returned to normal. The results of this study may help to more precisely determine potential environmental impacts of thermal pollution and raise the possibility that the capacity for fish vertebrae to recover from the impacts of chronic thermal exposures may be an important consideration in marine fish conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2902303089,"There is an established relationship between primary DNA sequence, secondary and tertiary chromatin structure, and transcriptional activity, suggesting that observed differences in one of these properties may reflect changes in the others. Here, we exploit these relationships to show that variations in DNA structure can be used to identify a wide range of genomic alterations in mammalian samples. In this proof-of-concept study we characterized and compared genome-wide histone occupancy by ChIP-Seq, DNA accessibility by ATAC-Seq, and chromosomal conformation by Hi-C for five CRISPR/Cas9-modified mammalian cell lines and their unmodified parent strains, as well as in one modified tissue sample and its parent strain. The results showed that the impact of genomic alterations on each of the levels of DNA organization varied depending on mutation type (insertion or deletion), size, and genomic location. The largest genomic alterations we identified included chromosomal rearrangements and deletions (greater than 200 Kb) in four of the modified cell lines, which can be difficult to identify by standard whole genome sequencing analysis. This multi-level DNA organizational analysis provides a sensitive approach for identifying a wide range of genomic and epigenomic perturbations that can be utilized for biomedical and biosecurity applications."
https://openalex.org/W2902744288,"Introduction Higher levels of social connectedness are associated with better physical and mental health outcomes, but measures of connectedness are often study specific. Prior research has distinguished between perceived and received (quantifiable) measures of social connectedness, with differing impacts on health, sometimes mediated by place of residence. This analysis investigated the relationship between perceptions of social support/connection and quantifiable measures of social encounters, by neighbourhood, to inform understanding of place-based differences in connectedness and health outcomes. Methods Negative binomial regression models were used to determine associations between perceptions of social connectedness (perceived community connections and social involvement) and the number of recorded daily social encounters as a proxy for received support/connectedness. Analyses were undertaken across two Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Melbourne with disparate socio-economic profiles to examine potential modification of social connectedness measures by neighbourhood of residence. Results Two measures of perceived connectedness had a clear relationship with recorded daily social encounters–feeling a sense of community belonging (RR 1.20 (1.04, 1.37), p = 0.010) and having family or friends close by (RR 1.30 (1.10,1.54), p = 0.002 “neither” compared to “disagree”, (RR 1.15 (1.04, 1.26), p = 0.006 “agree” compared to “disagree”). Involvement in a local church, sporting or social club was associated with a greater number of daily social encounters for respondents who participated a few times a year (RR 1.17 (1.05,1.32), p = 0.006) or often (RR 1.23 (1.12,1.36), p<0.001) compared to never. In the less affluent LGA, active contributions to neighbours and community through assistance and volunteering were a frequent driver of social connection. Differences in patterns between the two areas were found with some measures of perception showing stronger relationships with recorded daily encounters in one area but not the other. Conclusions These results indicate substantial complexity in the relationship between perceptions of social connectedness and recorded daily social encounters/received connectedness, meaning that one cannot be reliably extrapolated from the other. Drivers of individuals’ social connections also varied by area of residence. These findings offer new insights into potential mediators of the association between connectedness and wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W2903178267,"In the histidine kinase family, the HAMP and DHp domains are considered to play an important role into the transmission of signal arising from environmental conditions to the auto-phosphorylation site and to the binding site of response regulator. Several conformational motions inside HAMP have been proposed to transmit this signal: (i) the gearbox model, (ii) α helices rotations, pistons and scissoring, (iii) transition between ordered and disordered states. In the present work, we explore by temperature-accelerated molecular dynamics (TAMD), an enhanced sampling technique, the conformational space of the cytoplasmic region of histidine kinase CpxA. Several HAMP motions, corresponding to α helices rotations, pistoning and scissoring have been detected and correlated to the segmental motions of HAMP and DHp domains of CpxA."
