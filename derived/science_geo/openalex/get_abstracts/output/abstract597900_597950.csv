https://openalex.org/W2765253743,"Breast cancer risk is influenced by rare coding variants in susceptibility genes, such as BRCA1, and many common, mostly non-coding variants. However, much of the genetic contribution to breast cancer risk remains unknown. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study of breast cancer in 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls of European ancestry and 14,068 cases and 13,104 controls of East Asian ancestry. We identified 65 new loci that are associated with overall breast cancer risk at P < 5 × 10-8. The majority of credible risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms in these loci fall in distal regulatory elements, and by integrating in silico data to predict target genes in breast cells at each locus, we demonstrate a strong overlap between candidate target genes and somatic driver genes in breast tumours. We also find that heritability of breast cancer due to all single-nucleotide polymorphisms in regulatory features was 2-5-fold enriched relative to the genome-wide average, with strong enrichment for particular transcription factor binding sites. These results provide further insight into genetic susceptibility to breast cancer and will improve the use of genetic risk scores for individualized screening and prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2767046868,"Locomotion is a universal behaviour that provides animals with the ability to move between places. Classical experiments have used electrical microstimulation to identify brain regions that promote locomotion, but the identity of neurons that act as key intermediaries between higher motor planning centres and executive circuits in the spinal cord has remained controversial. Here we show that the mouse caudal brainstem encompasses functionally heterogeneous neuronal subpopulations that have differential effects on locomotion. These subpopulations are distinguishable by location, neurotransmitter identity and connectivity. Notably, glutamatergic neurons within the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi), a small subregion in the caudal brainstem, are essential to support high-speed locomotion, and can positively tune locomotor speed through inputs from glutamatergic neurons of the upstream midbrain locomotor region. By contrast, glycinergic inhibitory neurons can induce different forms of behavioural arrest mapping onto distinct caudal brainstem regions. Anatomically, descending pathways of glutamatergic and glycinergic LPGi subpopulations communicate with distinct effector circuits in the spinal cord. Our results reveal that behaviourally opposing locomotor functions in the caudal brainstem were historically masked by the unexposed diversity of intermingled neuronal subpopulations. We demonstrate how specific brainstem neuron populations represent essential substrates to implement key parameters in the execution of motor programs."
https://openalex.org/W2766170679,"Although numerous studies have demonstrated the key role of bacterial diversity in soil functions and ecosystem services, little is known about the variations and determinants of such diversity on a nationwide scale. The overall objectives of this study were i) to describe the bacterial taxonomic richness variations across France, ii) to identify the ecological processes (i.e. selection by the environment and dispersal limitation) influencing this distribution, and iii) to develop a statistical predictive model of soil bacterial richness. We used the French Soil Quality Monitoring Network (RMQS), which covers all of France with 2,173 sites. The soil bacterial richness (i.e. OTU number) was determined by pyrosequencing 16S rRNA genes and related to the soil characteristics, climatic conditions, geomorphology, land use and space. Mapping of bacterial richness revealed a heterogeneous spatial distribution, structured into patches of about 111km, where the main drivers were the soil physico-chemical properties (18% of explained variance), the spatial descriptors (5.25%, 1.89% and 1.02% for the fine, medium and coarse scales, respectively), and the land use (1.4%). Based on these drivers, a predictive model was developed, which allows a good prediction of the bacterial richness (R2adj of 0.56) and provides a reference value for a given pedoclimatic condition."
https://openalex.org/W2766002564,"Composting is viewed as one of the primary methods to treat organic wastes. Co-composting may improve the efficiency of this treatment by establishing the most suitable conditions for decomposers than those present in the individual wastes. Given that bacteria and fungi are the driving agents of composting, information about the composition of their communities and dynamics during composting may improve reproducibility, performance and quality of the final compost as well as help to evaluate the potential human health risk and the choice of the most appropriate application procedure. In this study, the co-composting of mixtures containing two similar components (organic fraction of municipal solid waste and sawdust polluted by oil) and one discriminate component (sewage sludges of different origin) were investigated. Bacterial and fungal community successions in the two mixtures were analyzed during the composting process by determining the change in their structural dynamics using qPCR and 454 pyrosequencing methods in a lab experiment for a period of 270 days. During the initial composting stage, the number of 16S bacterial copies was (3.0±0.2) x 106 and (0.4±0.0) x 107 g-1, and the Rhodospiralles and Lactobacialles orders dominated. Fungal communities had (2.9±0.0) x105 and (6.1±0.2) x105 ITS copies g-1, and the Saccharomycetales order dominated. At the end of the thermophilic stage on the 30th day of composting, bacterial and fungal communities underwent significant changes: dominants changed and their relative abundance decreased. Typical compost residents included Flavobacteriales, Chitinophagaceae and Bacterioidetes for bacteria and Microascaceae, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Agaricomycetes for fungi. During the later composting stages, the dominating taxa of both bacterial and fungal communities remained, while their relative abundance decreased. In accordance with the change in the dominating OTUs, it was concluded that the dynamics of the bacterial and fungal communities were not similar. Analysis by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed that the bacterial communities of the two composts became progressively more similar; a similar trend was followed by the fungal community."
https://openalex.org/W2766671099,"The three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L., hereafter 'stickleback') is a common mesopredatory fish in marine, coastal and freshwater areas. In large parts of the Baltic Sea, stickleback densities have increased >10-fold during the last decades, and it is now one of the dominating fish species both in terms of biomass and effects on lower trophic levels. Still, relatively little is known about its diet-knowledge which is essential to understand the increasing role sticklebacks play in the ecosystem. Fish diet analyses typically rely on visual identification of stomach contents, a labour-intensive method that is made difficult by prey digestion and requires expert taxonomic knowledge. However, advances in DNA-based metabarcoding methods promise a simultaneous identification of most prey items, even from semi-digested tissue. Here, we studied the diet of stickleback from the western Baltic Sea coast using both DNA metabarcoding and visual analysis of stomach contents. Using the cytochrome oxidase (CO1) marker we identified 120 prey taxa in the diet, belonging to 15 phyla, 83 genera and 84 species. Compared to previous studies, this is an unusually high prey diversity. Chironomids, cladocerans and harpacticoids were dominating prey items. Large sticklebacks were found to feed more on benthic prey, such as amphipods, gastropods and isopods. DNA metabarcoding gave much higher taxonomic resolution (median rank genus) than visual analysis (median rank order), and many taxa identified using barcoding could not have been identified visually. However, a few taxa identified by visual inspection were not revealed by barcoding. In summary, our results suggest that the three-spined stickleback feeds on a wide variety of both pelagic and benthic organisms, indicating that the strong increase in stickleback populations may affect many parts of the Baltic Sea coastal ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2766515299,"Knee osteoarthritis is a leading global cause of health-related quality of life loss. The aim of this project was to quantify health losses arising from knee osteoarthritis in New Zealand (NZ) in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost.The Osteoarthritis Policy Model (OAPol), a validated Monte Carlo computer simulation model, was used to estimate QALYs lost due to knee osteoarthritis in the NZ adult population aged 40-84 over their lifetimes from the base year of 2006 until death. Data were from the NZ Health Survey, NZ Burden of Diseases, NZ Census, and relevant literature. QALYs were derived from NZ EQ-5D value set 2. Sensitivity to health state valuation, disease and pain prevalence were assessed in secondary analyses.Based on NZ EQ-5D health state valuations, mean health losses due to knee osteoarthritis over people's lifetimes in NZ are 3.44 QALYs per person, corresponding to 467,240 QALYs across the adult population. Average estimated per person QALY losses are higher for non-Māori females (3.55) than Māori females (3.38), and higher for non-Māori males (3.34) than Māori males (2.60). The proportion of QALYs lost out of the total quality-adjusted life expectancy for those without knee osteoarthritis is similar across all subgroups, ranging from 20 to 23 percent.At both the individual and population levels, knee osteoarthritis is responsible for large lifetime QALY losses. QALY losses are higher for females than males due to greater prevalence of knee osteoarthritis and higher life expectancy, and lower for Māori than non-Māori due to lower life expectancy. Large health gains are potentially realisable from public health and policy measures aimed at decreasing incidence, progression, pain, and disability of osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2766283623,"To identify suitable cell lines for a mimetic system of in vivo blood-brain barrier (BBB) for drug permeability assessment, we characterized two immortalized cell lines, ECV304 and bEnd3 in the respect of the tightness, tight junction proteins, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) function and discriminative brain penetration. The ECV304 monoculture achieved higher transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and lower permeability to Lucifer yellow than bEnd3. However, co-culture with rat glioma C6 cells impaired the integrity of ECV304 and bEnd3 cell layers perhaps due to the heterogeneity among C6 cells in inducing BBB characteristics. The immunostaining of ZO-1 delivered distinct bands along cell borders on both cell lines while those of occludin and claudin-5 were diffused and weak. P-gp functionality was only proved in bEnd3 by Rhodamine 123 (R123) uptake assay. A permeability test of reference compounds displayed a similar rank order (digoxin < R123 < quinidine, verapamil < propranolol) in ECV304 and bEnd3 cells. In comparison with bEnd3, ECV304 developed tighter barrier for the passage of reference compounds and higher discrimination between transcellular and paracellular transport. However, the monoculture models of ECV304 and bEnd3 fail to achieve the sufficient tightness of in vitro BBB permeability models with high TEER and evident immunostaining of tight junction proteins. Further strategies to enhance the paracellular tightness of both cell lines to mimic in vivo BBB tight barrier deserve to be conducted."
https://openalex.org/W2765651609,"Monitoring is an essential component of wildlife management and conservation. However, the usefulness of monitoring data is often undermined by the lack of 1) coordination across organizations and regions, 2) meaningful management and conservation objectives, and 3) rigorous sampling designs. Although many improvements to avian monitoring have been discussed, the recommendations have been slow to emerge in large-scale programs. We introduce the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions (IMBCR) program designed to overcome the above limitations. Our objectives are to outline the development of a statistically defensible sampling design to increase the value of large-scale monitoring data and provide example applications to demonstrate the ability of the design to meet multiple conservation and management objectives. We outline the sampling process for the IMBCR program with a focus on the Badlands and Prairies Bird Conservation Region (BCR 17). We provide two examples for the Brewer’s sparrow (Spizella breweri) in BCR 17 demonstrating the ability of the design to 1) determine hierarchical population responses to landscape change and 2) estimate hierarchical habitat relationships to predict the response of the Brewer’s sparrow to conservation efforts at multiple spatial scales. The collaboration across organizations and regions provided economy of scale by leveraging a common data platform over large spatial scales to promote the efficient use of monitoring resources. We designed the IMBCR program to address the information needs and core conservation and management objectives of the participating partner organizations. Although it has been argued that probabilistic sampling designs are not practical for large-scale monitoring, the IMBCR program provides a precedent for implementing a statistically defensible sampling design from local to bioregional scales. We demonstrate that integrating conservation and management objectives with rigorous statistical design and analyses ensures reliable knowledge about bird populations that is relevant and integral to bird conservation at multiple scales."
https://openalex.org/W2765726792,"Mucin-type O-glycosylation is the most abundant type of O-glycosylation. It is initiated by the members of the polypeptide N-acetyl-α-galactosaminyltransferase (ppGalNAc-T) family and closely associated with both physiological and pathological conditions, such as coronary artery disease or Alzheimer's disease. The lack of direct and selective inhibitors of ppGalNAc-Ts has largely impeded research progress in understanding the molecular events in mucin-type O-glycosylation. Here, we report that a small molecule, the plant flavonoid luteolin, selectively inhibits ppGalNAc-Ts in vitro and in cells. We found that luteolin inhibits ppGalNAc-T2 in a peptide/protein-competitive manner but not promiscuously (e.g. via aggregation-based activity). X-ray structural analysis revealed that luteolin binds to the PXP motif–binding site found in most protein substrates, which was further validated by comparing the interactions of luteolin with wild-type enzyme and with mutants using 1H NMR–based binding experiments. Functional studies disclosed that luteolin at least partially reduced production of β-amyloid protein by selectively inhibiting the activity of ppGalNAc-T isoforms. In conclusion, our study provides key structural and functional details on luteolin inhibiting ppGalNAc-T activity, opening up the way for further optimization of more potent and specific ppGalNAc-T inhibitors. Moreover, our findings may inform future investigations into site-specific O-GalNAc glycosylation and into the molecular mechanism of luteolin-mediated ppGalNAc-T inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2766177463,"Neonicotinoid insecticides can cause a variety of adverse sub-lethal effects in bees. In social species such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera, queens are essential for reproduction and colony functioning. Therefore, any negative effect of these agricultural chemicals on the mating success of queens may have serious consequences for the fitness of the entire colony. Queens were exposed to the common neonicotinoid pesticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin during their developmental stage. After mating, their spermathecae were dissected to count the number of stored spermatozoa. Furthermore, their worker offspring were genotyped with DNA microsatellites to determine the number of matings and the genotypic composition of the colony. Colonies providing the male mating partners were also inferred. Both neonicotinoid and control queens mated with drones originating from the same drone source colonies, and stored similar number of spermatozoa. However, queens reared in colonies exposed to both neonicotinoids experienced fewer matings. This resulted in a reduction of the genetic diversity in their colonies (i.e. higher intracolonial relatedness). As decreased genetic diversity among worker bees is known to negatively affect colony vitality, neonicotinoids may have a cryptic effect on colony health by reducing the mating frequency of queens."
https://openalex.org/W2765095075,"Objectives To assess the current incidence, clinical features, risk factors, aetiology, antimicrobial resistance and outcomes of polymicrobial bloodstream infection (PBSI) in patients with cancer. Methods All prospectively collected episodes of PBSI in hospitalised patients were compared with episodes of monomicrobial bloodstream infection (MBSI) between 2006 and 2015. Results We identified 194 (10.2%) episodes of PBSI and 1702 MBSI (89.8%). The presence of cholangitis, biliary stenting, neutropenia, corticosteroids, neutropenic enterocolitis and other abdominal infections were identified as risk factors for PBSI. Overall, Gram-negative organisms were the most frequent aetiology, but Enterococcus spp. were especially frequent causes of Gram-positive PBSI (30.8%). Multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms were more commonly found in PBSI than in MBSI (20.6% vs 12.9%; p = 0.003). Compared to patients with MBSI, those with PBSI presented with higher early (15% vs 1.4%; p = 0.04) and overall (32% vs 20.9%; p<0.001) case-fatality rates. Risk factors for overall case-fatality were a high-risk MASCC (Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer) index score, corticosteroid use, persistent bacteraemia and septic shock. Conclusions PBSI is a frequent complication in patients with cancer and is responsible for high mortality rates. Physicians should identify patients at risk for PBSI and provide empiric antibiotic therapy that covers the most frequent pathogens involved in these infections, including MDR strains."
https://openalex.org/W2765684802,"A fully-automated method based on graph shortest path, graph cut and neutrosophic (NS) sets is presented for fluid segmentation in OCT volumes for exudative age related macular degeneration (EAMD) subjects. The proposed method includes three main steps: 1) The inner limiting membrane (ILM) and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layers are segmented using proposed methods based on graph shortest path in NS domain. A flattened RPE boundary is calculated such that all three types of fluid regions, intra-retinal, sub-retinal and sub-RPE, are located above it. 2) Seed points for fluid (object) and tissue (background) are initialized for graph cut by the proposed automated method. 3) A new cost function is proposed in kernel space, and is minimized with max-flow/min-cut algorithms, leading to a binary segmentation. Important properties of the proposed steps are proven and quantitative performance of each step is analyzed separately. The proposed method is evaluated using a publicly available dataset referred as Optima and a local dataset from the UMN clinic. For fluid segmentation in 2D individual slices, the proposed method outperforms the previously proposed methods by 18%, 21% with respect to the dice coefficient and sensitivity, respectively, on the Optima dataset, and by 16%, 11% and 12% with respect to the dice coefficient, sensitivity and precision, respectively, on the local UMN dataset. Finally, for 3D fluid volume segmentation, the proposed method achieves true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) of 90% and 0.74%, respectively, with a correlation of 95% between automated and expert manual segmentations using linear regression analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2762274139,"Publication bias is prevalent within the scientific literature. Whilst there are multiple ideas on how to reduce publication bias, only a minority of journals have made substantive changes to address the problem. We aimed to explore the perceived feasibility of strategies to reduce publication bias by gauging opinions of journal editors (n = 73) and other academics/researchers (n = 160) regarding nine methods of publishing and peer-reviewing research: mandatory publication, negative results journals/articles, open reviewing, peer-review training and accreditation, post-publication review, pre-study publication of methodology, published rejection lists, research registration, and two-stage review. Participants completed a questionnaire asking both quantitative (multiple choice or Likert scales) and qualitative (open-ended) questions regarding the barriers to implementing each suggestion, and their strengths and limitations. Participants were asked to rate the nine suggestions, then choose the method they felt was most effective. Mandatory publication was most popularly selected as the 'most effective' method of reducing publication bias for editors (25%), and was the third most popular choice for academics/researchers (14%). The most common selection for academics/researchers was two-stage review (26%), but fewer editors prioritised this (11%). Negative results journals/articles were the second and third most common choices for academics/researchers (21%) and editors (16%), respectively. Editors more commonly chose research registration as 'most effective' (21%), which was favoured by only 6% of academics/researchers. Whilst mandatory publication was generally favoured by respondents, it is infeasible to trial at a journal level. Where suggestions have already been implemented (e.g. negative results journals/articles, trial registration), efforts should be made to objectively assess their efficacy. Two-stage review should be further trialled as its popularity amongst academics/researchers suggests it may be well received, though editors may be less receptive. Several underlying barriers to change also emerged, including scientific culture, impact factors, and researcher training; these should be further explored to reduce publication bias."
https://openalex.org/W2765670860,"In the context of limited marine resources, the exponential growth of aquaculture requires the substitution of fish oil and fishmeal, the traditional components of fish feeds by terrestrial plant ingredients. High levels of such substitution are known to negatively impact fish performance such as growth and survival in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as in other salmonids. In this respect, genetic selection is a key enabler for improving those performances and hence for the further sustainable development of aquaculture. We selected a rainbow trout line over three generations for its ability to survive and grow on a 100% plant-based diet devoid of both fish oil and fishmeal (V diet) from the very first meal. In the present study, we compared the control line and the selected line after 3 generations of selection, both fed either the V diet or a marine resources-based diet (M diet). The objective of the study was to assess the efficiency of selection and the consequences on various correlated nutritional traits: feed intake, feed efficiency, digestibility, composition of whole fish, nutrient retention and fatty acid (FA) profile. We demonstrated that the genetic variability present in our rainbow trout population can be selected to improve survival and growth. The major result of the study is that after only three generations of selection, selected fish fed the V diet grew at the same rate as the control line fed the M diet, whilst the relative reduction of body weight was 36.8% before the selection. This enhanced performance on the V diet seems to be mostly linked to a higher feed intake for the selected fish."
https://openalex.org/W2766311440,"The periwinkle Littorina saxatilis has repeatedly evolved both a small, fragile and globose ""wave ecotype"" confined to wave-swept shores and a large, robust and elongated ""crab ecotype"" found in nearby crab-rich but less-exposed shores. This phenotypic divergence is assumed to reflect, in some part, local adaptation to wave exposure, but this hypothesis has received incomplete experimental testing. Here, we report a test of the prediction that the wave ecotype has a higher capacity to resist water flow than the crab ecotype. We sampled snails along a crab-wave transect and measured their resistance to dislodgement in a high-speed water flume with water speeds that match those of breaking waves in a range of relevant field conditions. Snails from the wave environment were consistently more resistant to water flow than snails from the crab environment and high resistance was positively correlated with the surface area of the foot and the area of the outer aperture contour both relative to shell size, and to the extent of lateral shell compression. In a separate experiment, we found that snails raised in still water in a common garden showed higher resistance to water flow if originating from a wave environment than from a crab environment, and this was true both at juvenile (2 weeks) and adult (10 months) developmental stages. This result suggests genetic control of a distinct “wave adapted” phenotype, likely to be maintained under strong divergent selection between the two adjacent habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2766145251,"Strategies to encourage exercise have led to research on cycle ergometer 'exergaming', as a means of enhancing exercise enjoyment. This research has typically prescribed the exercise intensity and used one exercise mode. The aim of this study was to compare self-selected exercise intensity on a cycle ergometer with and without exergaming modes activated. A total of 20 participants aged between 18-40 years (M = 24.2 ± 5.9) completed a sub-maximal exercise test. Participants returned two days later to complete one 45 minute session of self-selected exercise with 15 minutes in each of 'control' (standard ergometer), 'track', and 'game' modes, with order randomized. Heart rate, work rate, perceived exertion, and affective valence were recorded during exercise. Dissociation and enjoyment were recorded in the rest interval between each mode. Participants exercised above ventilatory threshold (VT) in all three modes (track, M = 9.5 ± 12%; game, M = 6.2 ± 12%; and control, M = 4.4 ± 14% above VT) and at higher work rates (P < 0.05) exergaming (track, M = 94.5 ± 27.9; game, M = 96.2 ± 32.8 watts) than control (M = 86.6 ± 26.5 watts). Despite exercising at a higher intensity, participants perceived exercise during the exergaming modes to be most pleasant (P < 0.01), with greater enjoyment (P < 0.01) and dissociation (P < 0.01) in the game than track mode, and both modes higher on these variables than the control mode. Findings support the use of exergaming as a strategy to encourage individuals to exercise, with participants choosing to work harder physiologically, but reporting more positive psychological responses during and following the exercise."

Yet, occurrence of dementia in PD is unpredictable. Evidence supports the hypothesis that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is involved in cognitive deficits. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between serum IGF-1 levels and neuropsychological scores in a large cohort of drug-naïve PD patients during the earliest stages of the disease.Serum IGF-1 levels were determined in 405 early, drug-naïve PD patients and 191 healthy controls (HC) enrolled in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). The association between serum IGF-1 levels and neuropsychological scores was evaluated with linear regression analysis.IGF-1 levels were similar in PD and HC. In PD patients the lowest IGF-1 quartile was a predictor of lower performances at the Semantic Fluency task (β = -3.46, 95%CI: -5.87 to -1.01, p = 0.005), the Symbol Digit Modalities Score (β = -2.09, 95%CI: -4.02 to -0.15, p = 0.034), and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Retention (β = -0.05, 95%CI: -0.09 to -0.009, p = 0.019).Lower serum IGF-1 levels are associated to poor performances in cognitive tasks assessing executive function, attention and verbal memory in a large cohort of early PD patients. Follow-up studies are warranted to assess if IGF-1 is related to the development of dementia in PD."

To gain mechanistic insight into how SPIN1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator, here we purified its interacting proteins. We identified an uncharacterized protein (C11orf84), which we renamed SPIN1 docking protein (SPIN·DOC), that directly binds SPIN1 and strongly disrupts its histone methylation reading ability, causing it to disassociate from chromatin.

NLR senses various microbial or physiological stimuli that lead to the assembly of inflammasome complexes. This molecular assembly activates procaspase-1 into active caspase-1 enzyme, which in turn activates proinflammatory cytokines, viz. IL-1β and IL-18. Secretion of mature IL-1β and IL-18 activates various inflammatory responses, which confer protection against infectious agents (4Man S.M. Kanneganti T.D. Converging roles of caspases in inflammasome activation, cell death and innate immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Activation of inflammasomes also leads to a lytic form of programmed cell death termed pyroptosis (5Shi J. Gao W. Shao F. Pyroptosis: gasdermin-mediated programmed necrotic cell death.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2017; 42: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). pathogen recognition receptor nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing protein Toll-like receptor TIR domain-containing protein from Brucella paraformaldehyde TIR domain-containing adaptor protein Toll/interleukin-1 receptor 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl α-d-galactoside maltose-binding protein caspase recruitment domain bone marrow-derived macrophages lactate dehydrogenase benzyloxycarbonyl fluoromethyl ketone synthetic defined radioimmune precipitation assay multiplicity of infection activation domain binding domain. Recent studies identified a non-canonical form of inflammasome activation that represents a new paradigm in the understanding of the innate immune mechanism (6Yang J. Zhao Y. Shao F. Non-canonical activation of inflammatory caspases by cytosolic LPS in innate immunity.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2015; 32: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In non-canonical inflammasome activation, murine caspase-11 and its human orthologue, caspase-4, serve as the receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is derived from the intracellular bacterial pathogens (7Shi J. Zhao Y. Wang Y. Gao W. Ding J. Li P. Hu L. Shao F. Inflammatory caspases are innate immune receptors for intracellular LPS.Nature. 2014; 514: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Upon binding to the LPS, caspase-4/11 undergoes oligomerization that leads to caspase-1–mediated maturation of IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-1α and pyroptosis. Activation of caspase-4/11 appears to be independent of other PPRs, including NLRP3, NLRP6, and NLRC4 (8Kayagaki N. Wong M.T. Stowe I.B. Ramani S.R. Gonzalez L.C. Akashi-Takamura S. Miyake K.

Non-canonical inflammasome activation targets caspase-11.Nature. 2011; 479: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). However, a role of NLRP3 downstream of caspase-4/11 activation for maturation of IL-1β has been reported (10Baker P.J. Boucher D. Bierschenk D. Tebartz C. Whitney P.G. D'Silva D.B. Tanzer M.C. Monteleone M. Robertson A.A. Cooper M.A. Alvarez-Diaz S. Herold M.J. Bedoui S. Schroder K. Masters S.L. NLRP3 inflammasome activation downstream of cytoplasmic LPS recognition by both caspase-4 and caspase-5.Eur. J. Immunol. 2015; 45: 2918-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The mechanism of caspase-4/11–mediated pyroptosis remains unclear. Recently, caspase-4/11–mediated cleavage of gasdermin D was reported to play an essential role in LPS-induced pyroptosis (11Shi J. Zhao Y. Wang K. Shi X. Wang Y. Huang H. Zhuang Y. Cai T. Wang F. Shao F.

Wu H. Lieberman J. Inflammasome-activated gasdermin D causes pyroptosis by forming membrane pores.Nature. 2016; 535: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). Activation of inflammasomes by intracellular pathogens or physiological stress leads to secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and pyroptosis. This process accomplishes two types of host defense mechanisms, viz. induction of inflammation that activates various antimicrobial responses and pyroptosis that leads to elimination of infected or damaged cells (2Sharma D. Kanneganti T.D. The cell biology of inflammasomes: mechanisms of inflammasome activation and regulation.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 213: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In addition, caspase-11 was reported to promote fusion of Legionella pneumophila-containing vacuoles with lysosomes by modulating the actin cytoskeleton through cofilin (13Akhter A. Caution K. Abu Khweek A. Tazi M. Abdulrahman B.A. Abdelaziz D.H. Voss O.H. Doseff A.I. Hassan H. Azad A.K. Schlesinger L.S. Wewers M.D. Gavrilin M.A. Amer A.O.

Pathogenic microorganisms have developed various strategies to subvert the host defense mechanisms to facilitate their persistence in the host. Previous studies have established diverse microbial strategies to suppress or evade Toll-like receptor (TLR)–mediated host innate immune responses (14Newman R.M. Salunkhe P. Godzik A. Reed J.C.

Immunol. 2015; 32: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which intracellular pathogens subvert inflammasome activation remain unclear. A recent study demonstrated that the intracellular bacterial pathogen Shigella inhibits caspase-4–mediated inflammasome activation (18Kobayashi T. Ogawa M. Sanada T. Mimuro H. Kim M. Ashida H. Akakura R. Yoshida M. Kawalec M. Reichhart J.M. Mizushima T. Sasakawa C. The Shigella OspC3 effector inhibits caspase-4, antagonizes inflammatory cell death, and promotes epithelial infection.Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 13: 570-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The effector protein OspC3 of Shigella interacts with the p19 subunit of caspase-4 and prevents heterodimerization of caspase-4–p19 and caspase-4–p10 that is required for activation of caspase-4 and subsequent pyroptosis of epithelial cells to decrease the bacterial burden (18Kobayashi T. Ogawa M. Sanada T. Mimuro H. Kim M. Ashida H. Akakura R. Yoshida M. Kawalec M. Reichhart J.M. Mizushima T. Sasakawa C. The Shigella OspC3 effector inhibits caspase-4, antagonizes inflammatory cell death, and promotes epithelial infection.Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 13: 570-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Similarly, the effector protein NleF of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli binds to the catalytic domain of caspase-4, which inhibits its catalytic activity and processing of IL-18. This resulted in the attenuation of caspase-4/11–IL-18–mediated innate immune responses in the gut (19Pallett M.A. Crepin V.F. Serafini N. Habibzay M. Kotik O. Sanchez-Garrido J. Di Santo J.P. Shenoy A.R. Berger C.N. Frankel G. Bacterial virulence factor inhibits caspase-4/11 activation in intestinal epithelial cells.Mucosal Immunol. 2017; 10: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Brucella are infectious intracellular pathogens found in a wide range of mammals, including humans, that cause abortion, infertility, and undulant fever (20Corbel M.J. Brucellosis: an overview.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1997; 3: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Brucella establish a replication niche in macrophages and subvert the host’s innate and adaptive immune responses (21Martirosyan A. Moreno E. Gorvel J.P. An evolutionary strategy for a stealthy intracellular Brucella pathogen.Immunol. Rev. 2011; 240: 211-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 22Oliveira S.C. de Almeida L.A. Carvalho N.B.

The Brucella effector TcpB is a TIR domain-containing protein that is encoded by all known species of Brucella. TcpB harbors a phosphoinositide phosphate-binding domain at the N terminus and a TIR domain at the C terminus (23Radhakrishnan G.K. Yu Q. Harms J.S. Splitter G.A.

TcpB suppresses NF-κB activation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion mediated by TLR2 and -4 (16Cirl C. Wieser A. Yadav M. Duerr S. Schubert S. Fischer H. Stappert D. Wantia N. Rodriguez N.

Immunol. 2010; 184: 956-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). TcpB induces targeted ubiquitination and degradation of the TLR2/4 adaptor protein TIRAP to suppress TLR signaling (23Radhakrishnan G.K. Yu Q. Harms J.S. Splitter G.A.

Immunol. 2010; 184: 956-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). TcpB also modulates the dynamics of host microtubule polymerization by acting as the microtubule stabilization factor, which is correlated with its TLR suppression properties (25Radhakrishnan G.K. Harms J.S. Splitter G.A. Modulation of microtubule dynamics by a TIR domain protein from the intracellular pathogen Brucella melitensis.Biochem. J. 2011; 439: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TcpB exhibits cell permeability, and the internalized TcpB could efficiently inhibit LPS-induced NF-κB activation (26Radhakrishnan G.K. Splitter G.A. Biochemical and functional analysis of TIR domain containing protein from Brucella melitensis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 397: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that TcpB interacts with human caspase-4 and promotes ubiquitination and degradation of caspases 1, 4, and 11 that attenuated LPS- or Salmonella-induced non-canonical inflammasome signaling. Furthermore, we show that TcpB suppresses caspase-11–mediated secretion of IL-1β in Brucella-infected macrophages. Our experimental data indicate that TcpB attenuates non-canonical inflammasome–mediated pyroptosis and inflammatory responses in mouse and human macrophages. TcpB interacted with human caspase-4 in a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screening using the Mate and Plate technique. AH109 yeast strain harboring a TcpB-DNA-binding domain fusion was mated with a library of Y187 yeast strain carrying human cDNAs fused with the activation domain. The plasmids harboring the human cDNA were rescued from the blue colored diploid yeast colonies that were growing on quadruple amino acid dropout medium containing X-α-gal. Subsequent sequencing of isolated plasmids indicated caspase-4 as one of the interacting partners of TcpB. We also examined the interaction of TcpB with other caspases by yeast two-hybrid analysis. TcpB interacted with caspase-11, which is the murine orthologue of human caspase-4 (Fig. 1A). Our yeast two-hybrid analysis did not indicate interaction between TcpB and CARD-deficient caspase-4 or caspase-3 (Fig. 1A). Next, we analyzed the interaction of TcpB(G158A), which harbors a point mutation in the BB-loop region of the TIR domain (23Radhakrishnan G.K. Yu Q. Harms J.S. Splitter G.A. Brucella TIR domain-containing protein mimics properties of the Toll-like receptor adaptor protein TIRAP.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9892-9898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). TcpB(G158A) interacted with both caspase-4 and -11 but not with caspase-3 or CARD-deficient caspase-4 (supplemental Fig. 1). Next, we performed an immunoprecipitation assay to confirm the interaction of TcpB with caspase-4. Total lysate of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells that overexpress FLAG-caspase-4 was incubated with purified MBP-TcpB fusion protein or MBP alone followed by immunoprecipitation of caspase-4 using anti-FLAG antibody. MBP-TcpB could be coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-caspase-4, suggesting a potential interaction between caspase-4 and TcpB (Fig. 1B). MBP alone was not detected in immunoprecipitated samples, which indicated specific interaction between TcpB and caspase-4. TcpB negatively regulates TLR4-mediated innate immune signaling by targeting the degradation of the TLR4 adaptor protein TIRAP. Our experimental data revealed a positive interaction between TcpB and caspase-4. Therefore, we sought to determine whether TcpB induces degradation of caspase-4. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with an equal concentration of FLAG-caspase-4 and increasing concentrations of HA-TcpB followed by cell lysis, extraction of total protein, and immunoblotting to analyze the levels of caspase-4. TcpB induced degradation of caspase-4 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Because caspase-11 is the murine orthologue of human caspase-4, we wished to examine whether TcpB also induces enhanced degradation of caspase-11. Cotransfection of HA-TcpB and FLAG-caspase-11 resulted in enhanced degradation of FLAG-caspase-11 with increasing concentrations of HA-TcpB (Fig. 2B). Next, we performed a pulse-chase analysis of the degradation of caspase-4 or -11 in the presence or absence of TcpB. HEK293T cells expressing FLAG-caspase-4 or -11 in the presence or absence of HA-TcpB were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Subsequently, the degradation of caspase-4 or -11 was monitored at various time points. We observed gradual degradation of caspase-4 or -11 at increasing time points only in the presence of TcpB in cycloheximide-treated cells (Fig. 2, C and D, and supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). Next, we examined whether TcpB(G158A) is capable of inducing the degradation of caspase-4. Cotransfection of HEK293T cells with FLAG-caspase-4 and increasing concentrations of HA-TcpB(G158A) did not induce degradation of FLAG-caspase-4 (Fig. 2E), which indicates that an intact TIR domain is required for TcpB to induce the degradation of caspase-4. Intracellular LPS stimulates caspase-4/11, which leads to the activation of caspase-1 and release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β. Therefore, we wished to examine whether TcpB also promotes the degradation of caspase-1. Cotransfection of HEK293T cells with an equal concentration of FLAG-caspase-1 and increasing concentrations of HA-TcpB induced the degradation of caspase-1 (Fig. 2F). The degradation of caspase-1 was also observed in the presence of TcpB in cycloheximide-treated cells with increasing time points (supplemental Fig. 2, C and D). As observed before, cotransfection with TcpB(G158A) did not induce degradation of caspase-1, indicating the requirement of a functionally intact TIR domain for promoting the degradation of caspase-1 (Fig. 2G). Next, we analyzed the degradation of endogenous caspase-1 and -11 by TcpB in a mouse macrophage cell line. We previously reported that recombinant MBP-TcpB is cell-permeable and efficiently internalized by RAW264.7 macrophages (26Radhakrishnan G.K. Splitter G.A. Biochemical and functional analysis of TIR domain containing protein from Brucella melitensis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 397: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 2E). To analyze whether MBP-TcpB enhances the degradation of endogenous caspase-1 and -11, we treated RAW264.7 macrophages with MBP-TcpB or MBP followed by infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, which is a potent inducer of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. Subsequently, the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting followed by detection of endogenous caspase-1 and -11 using the respective antibodies. Macrophages treated with MBP-TcpB showed diminished levels of caspase-1 and -11 compared with the cells incubated with MBP alone (Fig. 2H). To examine the specificity of TcpB for inducing the degradation of caspases, we cotransfected an equal concentration of FLAG-caspase-3 with increasing concentrations of MYC-TcpB followed by analysis of the degradation of FLAG-caspase-3. TcpB did not induce the degradation of FLAG-caspase-3 (supplemental Fig. 2F). Taken together, our experimental data clearly indicate that TcpB induces degradation of inflammatory caspases, which mediates non-canonical inflammasome signaling. Selective protein degradation in eukaryotic cells is achieved by ubiquitination of target proteins and their degradation by the 20S proteasome complex. TcpB is reported to promote the ubiquitination of the TLR4 adaptor protein TIRAP, which leads to its enhanced degradation. This process negatively regulates the LPS-induced signaling through TLR4 (24Sengupta D. Koblansky A. Gaines J. Brown T. West A.P. Zhang D. Nishikawa T. Park S.G. Roop 2nd, R.M. Ghosh S. Subversion of innate immune responses by Brucella through the targeted degradation of the TLR signaling adapter, MAL.J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 956-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Given that TcpB promotes degradation of caspases 1, 4, and 11, we analyzed whether TcpB induces their ubiquitination by in vivo ubiquitination assay. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with MYC-TcpB; FLAG-caspase-1, -4, or -11; and HA-ubiquitin followed by immunoprecipitation of FLAG-caspases and immunoblotting. Ubiquitin-conjugated FLAG-caspases were detected by probing the membrane with anti-HA antibody. We observed an enhanced ubiquitination of caspases 11, 4, and 1 in the presence of TcpB (Fig. 3, A, B, and C). The experimental data indicate that TcpB induces ubiquitination of inflammatory caspases that may promote their degradation through proteasomes. Caspase-4/11 recognizes the presence of intracellular LPS, which is derived from Gram-negative bacterial pathogens and activates the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. Caspase-4/11 binds to intracellular LPS, which leads to their oligomerization, which induces pyroptotic cell death and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α and IL-1β (2Sharma D. Kanneganti T.D. The cell biology of inflammasomes: mechanisms of inflammasome activation and regulation.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 213: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 7Shi J. Zhao Y.

Diamond C.E. Spreafico R. Balachander A. Sobota R.M. Mortellaro A. Human caspase-4 and caspase-5 regulate the one-step non-canonical inflammasome activation in monocytes.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Given that TcpB induces degradation of inflammatory caspases, we wished to examine whether TcpB suppresses caspase-4/11–mediated pyroptosis and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. First, we analyzed whether TcpB suppresses intracellular LPS-induced pyroptotic cell death in a murine macrophage cell line (RAW264.7), primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), and a human monocytic cell line (THP1). Cells were primed with Pam3CSK4 followed by treatment with purified MBP-TcpB or MBP alone for 4 h. Next, the cells were transfected with E. coli LPS, which is a potent inducer of pyroptotic cell death via activation of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway mediated by caspase-4/11. Induction of pyroptotic cell death by LPS was detected by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released by the cells. Macrophages treated with MBP-TcpB released decreased levels of LDH compared with the cells treated with MBP alone (Fig. 4A). To further verify this observation, primed RAW264.7 cells were treated with MBP-TcpB or MBP followed by LPS transfection and staining with Zombie Red dye, which is non-permeant to live cells but permeant to cells with compromised cell plasma membranes (28Zanoni I. Tan Y. Di Gioia M. Broggi A. Ruan J. Shi J. Donado C.A. Shao F. Wu H. Springstead J.R. Kagan J.C. An endogenous caspase-11 ligand elicits interleukin-1 release from living dendritic cells.Science. 2016; 352: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Zombie Red dye binds to primary amine group of proteins, and most of the cells treated with TcpB-MBP excluded the Zombie Red dye and displayed labeling only on the cell periphery (Fig. 4B). RAW264.7 cells treated with MBP alone displayed increasing amounts of total protein labeling and appeared brighter, indicating pyroptotic cell death (Fig. 4B). These experimental data imply that TcpB suppresses intracellular LPS-induced pyroptotic cell death in macrophages. Next, we examined whether TcpB affects paraformaldehyde (PFA)-induced cytotoxicity, which is independent of caspase-4/11. THP1 cells were incubated with MBP-TcpB or MBP alone followed by treatment of cells with PFA. TcpB did not affect the cell death induced by PFA, which suggests that TcpB attenuates cytotoxicity induced by inflammatory caspases (supplemental Fig. 3A). In addition to inducing pyroptosis, activation of caspase-4/11 by LPS leads to secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, viz. IL-1α and IL-1β (29Casson C.N. Yu J. Reyes V.M. Taschuk F.O. Yadav A. Copenhaver A.M. Nguyen H.T. Collman R.G. Shin S. Human caspase-4 mediates noncanonical inflammasome activation against Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 6688-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the effect of TcpB on secretion of caspase-4/11–induced inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. Primed BMDMs or RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with MBP-TcpB or MBP alone followed by LPS transfection and quantification of secreted IL-1α and IL-1β by ELISA. Macrophages treated with MBP-TcpB secreted diminished levels of IL-1α and IL-1β compared with MBP-treated cells (Fig. 4, C and D, and supplemental Fig. 3B). Taken together, these experimental data indicate that TcpB suppresses intracellular LPS–induced pyroptosis and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages. Next, we analyzed whether TcpB(G158A), which is deficie"

Spatial reference systems, such as coordinates or cardinal directions, are helpful tools for any geometric localization of positions that aims to be as exact as possible. Considering modern visualization techniques of multimedia cartography, map elements transferred through the auditory channel can be added easily. Audiovisual approaches have been discussed in the cartographic community for many years. However, the effectiveness of audiovisual map elements for map use has hardly been explored so far. Within an interdisciplinary (cartography-cognitive psychology) research project, it is examined whether map users remember object-locations better if they do not just read the corresponding place names, but also listen to them as voice recordings. This approach is based on the idea that learning object-identities influences learning object-locations, which is crucial for map-reading tasks. The results of an empirical study show that the additional auditory communication of object names not only improves memory for the names (object-identities), but also for the spatial accuracy of their corresponding object-locations. The audiovisual communication of semantic attribute information of a spatial object seems to improve the binding of object-identity and object-location, which enhances the spatial accuracy of object-location memory."
https://openalex.org/W2766567890,"Background 
Netrin-1, a secreted laminin-like protein identified as an axon guidance molecule, has been shown to be of critical importance in the cardiovascular system. Recent studies have revealed pro-angiogenic, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties of netrin-1 as well as cardioprotective actions against myocardial injury in diabetic mice.


Aim 
To examine the role of netrin-1 in diabetes-and high glucose (HG)-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED) using netrin-1 transgenic mice (Tg3) and cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC).


Main outcome 
Overexpression of netrin-1 prevented diabetes-induced VED in aorta from diabetic mice and netrin-1 treatment attenuated HG-induced impairment of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) function in BAECs.


Methods and results 
Experiments were performed in Tg3 and littermate control (WT) mice rendered diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ) and in BAECs treated with HG (25 mmol/L). Levels of netrin-1 and its receptor DCC, markers of inflammation and apoptosis and vascular function were assessed in aortas from diabetic and non-diabetic Tg3 and WT mice. Vascular netrin-1 in WT mice was reduced under diabetic conditions. Aortas from non-diabetic Tg3 and WT mice showed similar maximum endothelium-dependent relaxation (MEDR) (83% and 87%, respectively). MEDR was markedly impaired in aorta from diabetic WT mice (51%). This effect was significantly blunted in Tg3 diabetic aortas (70%). Improved vascular relaxation in Tg3 diabetic mice was associated with increased levels of phospho-ERK1/2 and reduced levels of oxidant stress, NFκB, COX-2, p16INK4A, cleaved caspase-3 and p16 and p53 mRNA. Netrin-1 treatment prevented the HG-induced decrease in NO production and elevation of oxidative stress and apoptosis in BAECs.


Conclusions 
Diabetes decreases aortic levels of netrin-1. However, overexpression of netrin-1 attenuates diabetes-induced VED and limits the reduction of NO levels, while increasing expression of p-ERK1/2, and suppressing oxidative stress and inflammatory and apoptotic processes. Enhancement of netrin-1 function may be a useful therapeutic means for preventing vascular dysfunction in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2765110996,"Depressive pathology, which includes both heightened negative affect (e.g., anxiety) and reduced positive affect (e.g., anhedonia), is known to be associated with sub-optimal decision-making, particularly in uncertain environments. Here, we use a computational approach to quantify and disambiguate how individual differences in these affective measures specifically relate to different aspects of learning and decision-making in reward-based choice behavior. Fifty-three individuals with a range of depressed mood completed a two-armed bandit task, in which they choose between two arms with fixed but unknown reward rates. The decision-making component, which chooses among options based on current expectations about reward rates, is modeled by two different decision policies: a learning-independent Win-stay/Lose-shift (WSLS) policy that ignores all previous experiences except the last trial, and Softmax, which prefers the arm with the higher expected reward. To model the learning component for the Softmax choice policy, we use a Bayesian inference model, which updates estimated reward rates based on the observed history of trial outcomes. Softmax with Bayesian learning better fits the behavior of 55% of the participants, while the others are better fit by a learning-independent WSLS strategy. Among Softmax “users”, those with higher anhedonia are less likely to choose the option estimated to be most rewarding. Moreover, the Softmax parameter mediates the inverse relationship between anhedonia and overall monetary gains. On the other hand, among WSLS “users”, higher state anxiety correlates with increasingly better ability of WSLS, relative to Softmax, to explain subjects’ trial-by-trial choices. In summary, there is significant variability among individuals in their reward-based, exploratory decision-making, and this variability is at least partly mediated in a very specific manner by affective attributes, such as hedonic tone and state anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W2765678735,"Oral mucositis (OM) is an important side effect of cancer treatment, characterized by ulcerative lesions in the mucosa of patients undergoing radiotherapy or chemotherapy, which has marked effects on patient quality of life and cancer therapy continuity. Considering that few protocols have demonstrated efficacy in preventing this side effect, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on OM induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in hamsters by studying signaling pathways. OM was induced in hamsters by 5-FU followed by mechanical trauma (MT) on day 4. On day 10, the animals were euthanized. The experimental groups included saline, MT, 5-FU, and DEX (0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg/kg). Macroscopic, histopathological, and immunohistochemical analyses as well as immunofluorescence experiments were performed on the oral mucosa of the animals. The oral mucosal samples were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). DEX (0.5 or 1 mg/kg) reduced inflammation and ulceration of the oral mucosa of hamsters. In addition, DEX (1 mg/kg) reduced the cytokine levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). DEX (1 mg/kg) also reduced the immunoexpression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, MIF, Smad 2/3, Smad 2/3 phosphorylated and NFκB p65 in the jugal mucosa. Finally, DEX (1 mg/kg) increased interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 3 (IRAK-M), glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MKP1) gene expression and reduced NFκB p65 and serine threonine kinase (AKt) gene expression, relative to the 5-FU group. Thus, DEX improved OM induced by 5-FU in hamsters."
https://openalex.org/W2766581953,"Intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) and oligoclonal bands (OCBs) are the most consistent and characteristic features of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). OCBs in MS are considered products of clonally expanded B cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), representing the sum of contributions from B cells in the brain. However, large amounts of IgG can be eluted from MS plaques in which lymphocytes are absent, and there is no correlation between levels of plaque-associated IgG and the presence of lymphocytes. It is calculated that it would take 3.2 billion lymphocytes to generate such large amounts of intrathecal IgG (30 mg in 500 ml CSF) in MS patients. Therefore, circulating lymphocytes in CSF could only account for <0.1% of the extra IgG in MS.We analyzed clinical laboratory parameters from sera and CSF of 115 patients including 91 patients with MS and 24 patients with other inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) disorders (IC). We investigated the relationship between oligoclonal bands, IgG antibodies, CSF cells, IgG Index, albumin, and total protein.MS patients have significantly elevated serum concentrations of IgG antibodies, albumin, and total protein, lower levels of lymphocytes, albumin, and total protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, but no difference in CSF IgG concentration compared to those with other inflammatory neurological disorders. Furthermore, in MS there was no linear relationship between the numbers of OCBs, CSF lymphocytes, CSF IgG, and IgG Index, and between serum IgG and serum albumin, but significant correlation between IgG in CSF and serum, and between CSF IgG and CSF albumin.There are unique differences between MS and patients with other inflammatory neurological disorders. Our data suggest that in MS patient (a) B cells and their products in the CSF may not be the sole source of intrathecal IgG; (b) oligoclonal bands may not be the products of single B cell clones in the CSF; and (c) there is a strong connection between serum components in the peripheral circulation and the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2766688758,"There are limited real-world data on prevalence and predictors of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) prolongation beyond one year after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We have explored such issue in the START ANTIPLATELET Registry, which is a prospective, observational, multicenter, Italian registry performed in seven Italian cardiology institutions including patients admitted for ACS and followed up to one year. Out of a total population of 840 ACS patients, 596 patients had completed 12-month follow-up being on DAPT. Decision to prolong DAPT beyond one year was taken in 79 patients (13%), whereas in 517 patients DAPT was stopped. The strongest predictors of DAPT continuation were a new cardiovascular events after the index admission event (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.4–7.7), no bleeding complications (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.2–8.3) and no anemia during one-year follow-up (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1–5.9); other independent predictors were renal failure (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3–5.0) and peripheral artery disease (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1–3.0). The choice of DAPT prolongation was not correlated with younger ager, presence of diabetes mellitus, coronary angioplasty as initial treatment strategy or type of implanted stent (drug-eluting vs bare metal). In conclusion, this study provides a real-world snapshot on the factors influencing the option to continue DAPT beyond one year after ACS; a low bleeding risk seems to influence the choice to prolong DAPT more than a high ischemic risk."
https://openalex.org/W2766674312,"In this study, we used 454-pyrosequencing to report the highly diverse diazotroph communities in the Kuroshio and its adjacent waters along a transect across the Tokara Strait, Japan. Terrestrial input from the islands resulted in a highly heterogeneous diazotroph community within a relatively small geographic region, which was presumably caused by the remarkably different responses of UCYN-A2, UCYN-C and Trichodesmium to the steep environmental gradient. On the other hand, most major cyanobacterial OTUs found in this study were also detected in an unpublished dataset from the upstream Kuroshio, which suggests transportation of diazotrophs by the Kuroshio in large geographic scale. A significant amount of UCYN-C was found in the Kuroshio and offshore stations, suggesting the importance of this potentially overlooked group in the western North Pacific Ocean (WNPO). Moreover, a novel sublineage of UCYN-B was defined, which was predominant in an oligotrophic water sample; and it was also found to be widely distributed in oceanic waters. In addition, the apparent increase in relative abundance of UCYN-A2 from offshore to near-shore water provides evidence for the earlier and under-debating view that UCYN-A2 prefers coastal conditions. Our report provides new knowledge for understanding the phylogeny and ecology of unicellular cyanobacterial diazotrophs in WNPO."
https://openalex.org/W2766864787,"To examine the association between a history of periodontitis (PD) and incident systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).We used 2003-2012 claims data from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Database to identify 7,204 incident SLE patients during 2007-2012 as the study group, along with randomly selecting 72,040 non-SLE patients matched (1:10) for age, gender, and first diagnosis date (index date) as the control group. The correlation between PD and SLE risk was estimated using conditional logistic regression analysis, after making adjustments for confounders (including a history of diabetes and number of non-PD related dental visits before the index date). To evaluate the effects of PD severity and the lag time which occurred since the last PD visit on SLE development, odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for subgroups of patients with PD according to their number of visits, cumulative cost and also the time gaps between their last PD-related visit and the index date.A statistically significant association between a history of PD and newly diagnosed SLE was observed (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.28; p-value, <0.001). The association was both dose- and time-dependent and was found to be strongest when the interval between the last PD-related visit and the index date was less than three months (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.61-2.09; p-value, <0.001). The association between PD exposure and SLE risk was consistently significant among subgroups stratified based on age, gender, or DM status.The results of this nationwide, population-based, case-control study suggest that there is a significant association between a history of PD and incident SLE in Taiwan. This weak association is limited to lack of information on individual smoking status in the database."
https://openalex.org/W2765290214,"Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) was conducted on 333 Cercospora isolates collected from Beta vulgaris (sugar beet, table beet and swiss chard) in the USA and Europe. Cercospora beticola was confirmed as the species predominantly isolated from leaves with Cercospora leaf spot (CLS) symptoms. However, C. cf. flagellaris also was detected at a frequency of 3% in two table beet fields in New York. Resolution of the spatial structure and identification of clonal lineages in C. beticola populations using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from GBS was compared to genotyping using microsatellites. Varying distance thresholds (bitwise distance = 0, 1.854599 × 10−4, and 1.298 × 10−3) were used for delineation of clonal lineages in C. beticola populations. Results supported previous reports of long distance dispersal of C. beticola through genotype flow. The GBS-SNP data set provided higher resolution in discriminating clonal lineages; however, genotype identification was impacted by filtering parameters and the distance threshold at which the multi-locus genotypes (MLGs) were contracted to multi-locus lineages. The type of marker or different filtering strategies did not impact estimates of population differentiation and structure. Results emphasize the importance of robust filtering strategies and designation of distance thresholds for delineating clonal lineages in population genomics analyses that depend on individual assignment and identification of clonal lineages. Detection of recurrent clonal lineages shared between the USA and Europe, even in the relaxed-filtered SNP data set and with a conservative distance threshold for contraction of MLGs, provided strong evidence for global genotype flow in C. beticola populations. The implications of intercontinental migration in C. beticola populations for CLS management are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2765384989,"Background/Aims Long-term follow-up studies validating the clinical benefit of sustained virological response (SVR) in people with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection are lacking. Our aim was to identify rates and predictors of liver fibrosis progression in a large, well characterized cohort of CHC patients in whom paired liver fibrosis assessments were performed more than 10 years apart. Methods CHC patients who had undergone a baseline liver biopsy pre-2004 and a follow up liver fibrosis assessment more than 10 years later (biopsy or liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using transient elastography [FibroScan]) were identified. Subjects who had undergone a baseline liver biopsy but had no follow up fibrosis assessment were recalled for LSM. Fibrosis was categorised as mild-moderate (METAVIR F0-2 / LSM result of ≤ 9.5 kPa) or advanced (METAVIR F3-4/ LSM >9.5 kPa). The primary objective was to assess the association between SVR and the rate of liver fibrosis progression over at least 10 years, defined as an increase from mild-moderate fibrosis at baseline liver biopsy (METAVIR F0-2) to advanced fibrosis at follow-up liver fibrosis assessment. Results 131 subjects were included in this analysis: 69% male, 82% Caucasian, 60% G1 HCV, 25% G3 HCV. The median age at F/U fibrosis staging was 57 (IQR 54–62) years with median estimated duration of infection 33-years (IQR 29–38). At F/U, liver fibrosis assessment was performed by LSM in 86% and liver biopsy in 14%. The median period between fibrosis assessments was 14-years (IQR 12–17). 109 (83%) participants had received interferon-based antiviral therapy. 40% attained SVR. At F/U, there was a significant increase in the proportion of subjects with advanced liver fibrosis: 27% at baseline vs. 46% at F/U (p = 0.002). The prevalence of advanced fibrosis did not change among subjects who attained SVR, 30% at B/L vs 25% at F/U (p = 0.343). However, advanced fibrosis became more common at F/U among subjects with persistent viremia: 10% at B/L vs 31% at F/U (p = 0.0001). SVR was independently associated with protection from liver fibrosis progression after adjustment for other variables including baseline ALT (p = 0.011), duration of HCV infection and mode of acquisition. Conclusion HCV eradication is associated with lower rates of liver fibrosis progression. The data support early treatment to prevent long-term liver complications of HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2766375586,"Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by changes in eNOS, is a common finding in chronic inflammatory vascular diseases. These states are associated with increased infectious complications. We hypothesized that alterations in eNOS would enhance the response to LPS-mediated TLR4 inflammation. Human microvascular endothelial cells were treated with sepiapterin or N-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) to alter endogenous NO production, and small interfering RNA to knockdown eNOS. Alterations of endogenous NO by sepiapterin, and L-NAME provided no significant changes to LPS inflammation. In contrast, eNOS knockdown greatly enhanced endothelial IL-6 production and permeability in response to LPS. Knockdown of eNOS enhanced LPS-induced p38. Inhibition of p38 with SB203580 prevented IL-6 production, without altering permeability. Knockdown of p38 impaired NF-κB activation. Physical interaction between p38 and eNOS was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation, suggesting a novel, NO-independent mechanism for eNOS regulation of TLR4. In correlation, biopsy samples in patients with systemic lupus erythematous showed reduced eNOS expression with associated elevations in TLR4 and p38, suggesting an in vivo link. Thus, reduced expression of eNOS, as seen in chronic inflammatory disease, was associated with enhanced TLR4 signaling through p38. This may enhance the response to infection in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions.—Stark, R. J., Koch, S. R., Choi, H., Mace, E. H., Dikalov, S. I., Sherwood, E. R., Lamb, F. S.

https://openalex.org/W2766559652,"Circadian clocks drive biological rhythms with a period of approximately 24 hours and keep in time with the outside world through daily resetting by environmental cues. While this external entrainment has been extensively investigated in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the role of internal systemic rhythms, including daily fluctuations in core temperature or circulating hormones remains debated. Here, we show that lactating mice, which exhibit dampened systemic rhythms, possess normal molecular clockwork but impaired rhythms in both heat shock response gene expression and electrophysiological output in their SCN. This suggests that body rhythms regulate SCN activity downstream of the clock. Mathematical modeling predicts that systemic feedback upon the SCN functions as an internal oscillator that accounts for in vivo and ex vivo observations. Thus we are able to propose a new bottom-up hierarchical organization of circadian timekeeping in mammals, based on the interaction in the SCN between clock-dependent and system-driven oscillators."
https://openalex.org/W2766734242,"Leadership positions are still stereotyped as masculine, especially in male-dominated fields (e.g., engineering). So how do gender stereotypes affect the evaluation of leaders and team cohesiveness in the process of team development? In our study participants worked in 45 small teams (4-5 members). Each team was headed by either a female or male leader, so that 45 leaders (33% women) supervised 258 team members (39% women). Over a period of nine months, the teams developed specific engineering projects as part of their professional undergraduate training. We examined leaders' self-evaluation, their evaluation by team members, and team cohesiveness at two points of time (month three and month nine, the final month of the collaboration). While we did not find any gender differences in leaders' self-evaluation at the beginning, female leaders evaluated themselves more favorably than men at the end of the projects. Moreover, female leaders were evaluated more favorably than male leaders at the beginning of the project, but the evaluation by team members did not differ at the end of the projects. Finally, we found a tendency for female leaders to build more cohesive teams than male leaders."

The hDPSCs were treated with eluates of iRoot FS at concentrations of 0.2 and 2 mg/mL, referred to as FS0.2 and FS2, respectively, and Biodentine (BD; Septodont, Saint Maur des Faussés, France) eluates at the corresponding concentrations as positive controls. A CCK8 assay was performed to determine cell proliferation. Wound healing and transwell assays were conducted to examine cell migration. Osteogenic differentiation was evaluated based on alkaline phosphatase activity, Alizarin Red S staining and quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to analyze the mRNA expression of differentiation gene markers. Cell proliferation was higher in the FS and BD groups than in the blank controls at 3 and 7 days. Moreover, FS0.2 enhanced cell migration and significantly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of hDPSCs. These findings suggested that iRoot FS is a bioactive material that promotes the proliferation, migration and osteogenic differentiation of hDPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2766568777,"This study was designed to evaluate the effect of ovariectomy on nutrikinetics of genistein metabolites. To characterize the time-dependent changes in genistein metabolite concentrations, we identified 13 genistein metabolites using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The nutrikinetics of the individual metabolites at different time points were analyzed. Nutrikinetic analysis showed that genistein, genistein 4′-glucuronide, genistein 7-glucuronide, 3-hydroxygenistein, and hippuric acid showed relatively high bioavailability in the sham group compared to that in the ovariectomy group, suggesting that ovariectomy likely results in lower genistein bioavailability. These results may be related to alteration of gut microbiota by ovariectomy. The relative abundance of species of the Parabacteroides, Dorea, and Butyricimonas genera, and Desulfovibrionaceae_unclassified, Lachnospiraceae_unclassified, and Rikenellaceae_unclassified families increased in the ovariectomy group while the relative abundance of 523_7_unclassified and Y52_unclassified_unclassified increased in the sham group. These results suggest that gut microbiota alteration by ovariectomy may affect genistein bioavailability."
https://openalex.org/W2766902301,"Arginine vasopressin (AVP), a hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary, plays a vital role in maintaining vasomotor tone during acute blood loss. We hypothesized that decompensated hemorrhagic shock is associated with decreased AVP stores and supplementation during resuscitation would improve both blood pressure and renal function. Using a decompensated hemorrhagic shock model, male Long-Evans rats were bled to mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of 40mmHg and maintained until the MAP could not be sustained without fluid. Once 40% of the shed volume was returned in lactated Ringer’s (Severe Shock), animals were resuscitated over 60 minutes with 4x the shed volume in lactated Ringer’s (LR) or the same fluids with AVP (0.5 units/kg+ 0.03 units/kg/min). Animals (n = 6-9/group) were sacrificed before hemorrhage (Sham), at Severe Shock, following resuscitation (60R, 60R with AVP) or 18 hours post-resuscitation (18hr, 18hr with AVP). Blood samples were taken to measure AVP levels and renal function. Pituitaries were harvested and assayed for AVP. Kidney samples were taken to assess mitochondrial function, histology, and oxidative damage. Baseline pituitary AVP stores (30,364 ± 5311 pg/mg) decreased with severe shock and were significantly depressed post-resuscitation (13,910 ± 3016 pg/ml. p<0.05) and at 18hr (15,592 ±1169 pg/ml, p<0.05). Resuscitation with LR+AVP led to higher serum AVP levels at 60R (31±8 vs 79±12; p<0.01) with an improved MAP both at 60R (125±3 vs 77±7mmHg; p<0.01) and 18hr (82±6 vs 69±5mmHg;p<0.05). AVP supplementation preserved complex I respiratory capacity at 60R and both complex I and II function at 18hr (p<0.05). AVP was also associated with decreased reactive oxygen species at 60R (856±67 vs 622±48F RFU) and significantly decreased oxidative damage as measured by mitochondrial lipid peroxidation (0.9±0.1 vs 1.7±0.1 fold change, p<0.01) and nitrosylation (0.9±0.1 vs 1.4±0.2 fold change, p<0.05). With AVP, renal damage was mitigated at 60R and histologic architecture was conserved at 18 hours. In conclusion, pituitary and serum AVP levels decrease during severe hemorrhage and may contribute to the development of decompensated hemorrhagic shock. Supplementing exogenous AVP during resuscitation improves blood pressure, preserves renal mitochondrial function, and mitigates acute kidney injury."
https://openalex.org/W2765558932,"There are differences in sleep duration between Blacks/African-Americans and Whites/European-Americans. Recently, we found differences between these ancestry groups in the circadian system, such as circadian period and the magnitude of phase shifts. Here we document the role of ancestry on sleep and cognitive performance before and after a 9-h advance in the sleep/wake schedule similar to flying east or having a large advance in sleep times due to shiftwork, both of which produce extreme circadian misalignment. Non-Hispanic African and European-Americans (N = 20 and 17 respectively, aged 21-43 years) were scheduled to four baseline days each with 8 h time in bed based on their habitual sleep schedule. This sleep/wake schedule was then advanced 9 h earlier for three days. Sleep was monitored using actigraphy. During the last two baseline/aligned days and the first two advanced/misaligned days, beginning 2 h after waking, cognitive performance was measured every 3 h using the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) test battery. Mixed model ANOVAs assessed the effects of ancestry (African-American or European-American) and condition (baseline/aligned or advanced/misaligned) on sleep and cognitive performance. There was decreased sleep and impaired performance in both ancestry groups during the advanced/misaligned days compared to the baseline/aligned days. In addition, African-Americans obtained less sleep than European-Americans, especially on the first two days of circadian misalignment. Cognitive performance did not differ between African-Americans and European-Americans during baseline days. During the two advanced/misaligned days, however, African-Americans tended to perform slightly worse compared to European-Americans, particularly at times corresponding to the end of the baseline sleep episodes. Advancing the sleep/wake schedule, creating extreme circadian misalignment, had a greater impact on the sleep of African-Americans than European-Americans. Ancestry differences in sleep appear to be exacerbated when the sleep/wake schedule is advanced, which may have implications for individuals undertaking shiftwork and transmeridian travel."
https://openalex.org/W2767144159,"Perforated fluid distribution pipes have been widely used in agriculture, water supply and drainage, ventilation, the chemical industry, and other sectors. The momentum equation for variable mass flow with a variable exchange coefficient and variable friction coefficient was developed by using the momentum conservation method under the condition of a certain slope. The change laws of the variable momentum exchange coefficient and the variable resistance coefficient along the flow were analyzed, and the function of the momentum exchange coefficient was given. According to the velocity distribution of the power function, the momentum equation of variable mass flow was solved for different Reynolds numbers. The analytical solution contains components of pressure, gravity, friction and momentum and reflects the influence of various factors on the pressure distribution along the perforated pipe. The calculated results of the analytical solution were compared with the experimental values of the study by Jin et al. 1984 and Wang et al. 2001 with the mean errors 8.2%, 3.8% and 2.7%, and showed that the analytical solution of the variable mass momentum equation was qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the experimental results."

We consider the supplier-customer network, which is a directed network representing the trading links between Japanese firms (links from suppliers to customers). The community structure of this network is determined by applying the Infomap algorithm. Each community is defined by its GDP and its associated business cycle. Business cycle correlations between communities are estimated based on copula theory. Then, based on firms’ attributes and network topology, these correlations are explained through linear econometric models. The results show strong evidence of business cycle correlations in the Japanese production network. A significant systemic risk is found for high negative or positive shocks. These correlations are explained mainly by the sector and by geographic similarities. Moreover, our results highlight the higher vulnerability of small communities and small firms, which is explained by the disassortative mixing of the production network."
https://openalex.org/W2766223901,"Our laboratory previously used the SEREX method in U937 cells and identified a novel leukemia-associated gene MLAA-34, a novel splice variant of CAB39L associated with acute monocytic leukemia, that exhibited anti-apoptotic activities in U937 cells. Whether MLAA-34 has an anti-apoptotic role in other tumor cells has not yet been reported. We explored whether MLAA-34 exhibited anti-apoptotic effects in HeLa cervical cancer cells and the possible mechanism of action. We generated a HeLa cell line stably expressing MLAA-34 and found that MLAA-34 overexpression had no effect on the growth, apoptosis and cell cycle of HeLa cells. However, upon treatment with arsenic trioxide (ATO) to induce apoptosis, the cell viability and colony formation ability of ATO-treated MLAA-34 stable HeLa cells were significantly higher than that of ATO-treated controls, and the apoptosis rate and proportion of G2/M cells also decreased. We found that ATO treatment of HeLa cells resulted in significant decreases in the expression of β-catenin mRNA and protein and the downstream target factors c-Myc, cyclin B1, and cyclin D1 in the Wnt signaling pathway. Notably, ATO-treated MLAA-34 stable HeLa cells showed a significant reduction in the ATO-mediated downregulation of these factors. In addition, MLAA-34 overexpression significantly increased the expression of nuclear β-catenin protein in ATO-treated cells compared with HeLa cells treated only with ATO. Thus, here we have found that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in ATO-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. MLAA-34 reduces ATO-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest, and the anti-apoptotic effect may be achieved by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in HeLa cells."
https://openalex.org/W2765233129,"Global analyses of bird communities along elevation gradients suggest that bird diversity on arid mountains is primarily limited by water availability, not temperature or altitude. However, the mechanism by which water availability, and subsequently primary productivity, increases bird diversity is still unclear. Here we evaluate two possible mechanisms from species-energy theory. The more individuals hypothesis proposes that a higher availability of resources increases the total number of individuals that can be supported, and therefore the greater number of species that will be sampled. By contrast, the more specialization hypothesis proposes that increasing resource availability will permit specialists to exploit otherwise rare resources, thus increasing total diversity. We used 5 years of surveys of grassland songbird communities along an elevational gradient in British Columbia, Canada, to distinguish between these hypotheses. Vegetation changed markedly in composition along the gradient and contrary to the expectations of the more specialization hypothesis, bird community composition was remarkably constant. However, both total abundance and species richness of birds increased with increasing water availability to plants. When we used rarefaction to correct species richness for differences in total abundance, much of the increase in bird diversity was lost, consistent with the expectations of the more individuals hypothesis. Furthermore, high species richness was associated with reductions in territory size of common bird species, rather than the fine-scale spatial partitioning of the landscape. This suggests that bird diversity increases when greater resource availability allows higher densities rather than greater habitat specialization. These results help explain a pervasive global pattern in bird diversity on arid mountains, and suggest that in such landscapes conservation of grassland birds is strongly linked to climate and hydrology."
https://openalex.org/W2765426326,"Enzymes of the glycoside hydrolase family 42 (GH42) are widespread in bacteria of the human gut microbiome and play fundamental roles in the decomposition of both milk and plant oligosaccharides. All GH42 enzymes characterized so far have β-galactosidase activity. Here, we report the existence of a GH42 subfamily that is exclusively specific for α-l-arabinopyranoside and describe the first representative of this subfamily. We found that this enzyme (BlArap42B) from a probiotic Bifidobacterium species cannot hydrolyze β-galactosides. However, BlArap42B effectively hydrolyzed paeonolide and ginsenoside Rb2, plant glycosides containing an aromatic aglycone conjugated to α-l-arabinopyranosyl-(1,6)-β-d-glucopyranoside. Paeonolide, a natural glycoside from the roots of the plant genus Paeonia, is not hydrolyzed by classical GH42 β-galactosidases. X-ray crystallography revealed a unique Trp345-X12-Trp358 sequence motif at the BlArap42B active site, as compared with a Phe-X12-His motif in classical GH42 β-galactosidases. This analysis also indicated that the C6 position of galactose is blocked by the aromatic side chains, hence allowing accommodation only of Arap lacking this carbon. Automated docking of paeonolide revealed that it can fit into the BlArap42B active site. The Glcp moiety of paeonolide stacks onto the aromatic ring of the Trp252 at subsite +1 and C4-OH is hydrogen bonded with Asp249. Moreover, the aglycone stacks against Phe421 from the neighboring monomer in the BlArap42B trimer, forming a proposed subsite +2. These results further support the notion that evolution of metabolic specialization can be tracked at the structural level in key enzymes facilitating degradation of specific glycans in an ecological niche. Enzymes of the glycoside hydrolase family 42 (GH42) are widespread in bacteria of the human gut microbiome and play fundamental roles in the decomposition of both milk and plant oligosaccharides. All GH42 enzymes characterized so far have β-galactosidase activity. Here, we report the existence of a GH42 subfamily that is exclusively specific for α-l-arabinopyranoside and describe the first representative of this subfamily. We found that this enzyme (BlArap42B) from a probiotic Bifidobacterium species cannot hydrolyze β-galactosides. However, BlArap42B effectively hydrolyzed paeonolide and ginsenoside Rb2, plant glycosides containing an aromatic aglycone conjugated to α-l-arabinopyranosyl-(1,6)-β-d-glucopyranoside. Paeonolide, a natural glycoside from the roots of the plant genus Paeonia, is not hydrolyzed by classical GH42 β-galactosidases. X-ray crystallography revealed a unique Trp345-X12-Trp358 sequence motif at the BlArap42B active site, as compared with a Phe-X12-His motif in classical GH42 β-galactosidases. This analysis also indicated that the C6 position of galactose is blocked by the aromatic side chains, hence allowing accommodation only of Arap lacking this carbon. Automated docking of paeonolide revealed that it can fit into the BlArap42B active site. The Glcp moiety of paeonolide stacks onto the aromatic ring of the Trp252 at subsite +1 and C4-OH is hydrogen bonded with Asp249. Moreover, the aglycone stacks against Phe421 from the neighboring monomer in the BlArap42B trimer, forming a proposed subsite +2. These results further support the notion that evolution of metabolic specialization can be tracked at the structural level in key enzymes facilitating degradation of specific glycans in an ecological niche. The complex microbial consortium in the human gastrointestinal tract, referred to as the gut microbiota, has an increasingly recognized vital role in human health (1Nicholson J.K. Holmes E. Kinross J. Burcelin R. Gibson G. Jia W. Pettersson S. Host-gut microbiota metabolic interactions.Science. 2012; 336: 1262-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (2913) Google Scholar). Human diet is rich in a wide variety of non-digestible saccharides from plants and animals, and glycan metabolism is a pivotal factor shaping the dynamics and the evolution of gut microbiota (2Koropatkin N.M. Cameron E.A. Martens E.C. How glycan metabolism shapes the human gut microbiota.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Specific taxa gain a competitive edge in fitness in this highly competitive niche through metabolic specialization, which is reflected by their enzymatic machinery being fine-tuned for specific glycans (3Peacock K.S.

Genomes of probiotic strains from the Bifidobacterium genus often encode several GH42 enzymes (8Sela D.A. Chapman J. Adeuya A. Kim J.H. Chen F. Whitehead T.R. Lapidus A. Rokhsar D.S. Lebrilla C.B.

For example, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis encodes three GH42 β-galactosidases related to the utilization of the human milk oligosaccharide lacto-N-tetraose (LNT), β-galactosides from bovine milk, and arabinogalactan, respectively (9Viborg A.H.

A similar specialization exists in Bifidobacterium breve that encodes two GH42 β-galactosidases, one targeting LNT (10James K. Motherway M.O. Bottacini F. van Sinderen D.

Abou Hachem M. Lahtinen S.J. Goh Y.J. Svensson B. Klaenhammer T.R.

Diversity in β-galactosidase specificities within Bifidobacterium: towards an understanding of β-galactoside metabolism in the gut niche.Trends Glycosci. Glycotech. 2015; 27: E9-E12Google Scholar). This distinct clade is here shown to form a novel GH42 subfamily present throughout the bacterial kingdom, which seems to have exclusive α-l-arabinopyranoside specificity as evaluated for the soluble intracellular BlArap42B using a panel of p-nitrophenyl (pNP)-substrates and oligosaccharides. BlArap42B effectively hydrolyzed paeonolide (Fig. 1A), a plant glycoside that contains a non-reducing end α-l-arabinopyranoside and is found in the roots of the widespread plant genus Paeonia (17Ding L. Zuo Q. Li D. Feng X. Gao X. Zhao F. Qiu F. A new phenone from the roots of Paeonia suffruticosa Andrews.Nat. Prod. Res. 2017; 31: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This apparent metabolic specialization could be tracked at the structural level, as the crystal structure of BlArap42B suggested GH42 members with α-l-arabinopyranosidase activity recognize their substrates through an active site Trp345–Trp358 motif as compared with a Phe–His motif in classical GH42 β-galactosidases. The recombinant BlArap42B was produced and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. BlArap42B migrated as a single band in SDS-PAGE with the expected theoretically calculated molecular mass of 78.3 kDa. Analytical gel filtration data showed that the protein eluted as a single peak corresponding to 201 kDa. Although this is smaller than the theoretically calculated size for the trimer (235 kDa), GH42 enzymes, which are generally trimeric, usually exhibit similar discrepancy between their size estimations using gel filtration chromatography and crystallography (18Hidaka M. Fushinobu S. Ohtsu N. Motoshima H. Matsuzawa H. Shoun H. Wakagi T. Trimeric crystal structure of the glycoside hydrolase family 42 β-galactosidase from Thermus thermophilus A4 and the structure of its complex with galactose.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). BlArap42B showed significant activity toward pNP-α-l-arabinopyranoside (pNP-α-l-Arap), very low activity toward pNP-β-d-galactopyranoside (pNP-β-d-Galp) and pNP-β-d-fucopyranoside (pNP-β-d-Fucp), and no detected activity on pNP-α-l-arabinofuranoside (pNP-α-l-Araf), pNP-β-d-xylopyranoside (pNP-β-d-Xylp), and pNP-β-d-glucopyranoside (pNP-β-d-Glcp) (Table 1). The kinetics of hydrolysis of pNP-α-l-Arap were best described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics with kcat = 160 ± 10 s−1 and Km = 3.4 ± 0.4 mm. RiArap42B, a homologue from Roseburia intestinalis M50/1 (Firmicutes isolated from human gut), sharing 42% sequence identity with BlArap42B (Actinobacteria), has a similar activity profile on aryl substrates (Table 1). BlArap42B displays significant activity toward 2-acetyl-5-methoxyphenyl-α-l-Arap-(1,6)- β-d-Glcp (paeonolide, Fig. 1A) in a 30-min assay, with complete hydrolysis by overnight incubation as verified by TLC (Fig. 1B). We also tested the activity of BlArap42B on plant glycosides containing a terminal α-l-arabinopyranoside group, paeonolide, ginsenoside Rb2, and quercetin 3-O-α-l-Arap (Fig. 1A), by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) (Fig. 1C). Ginsenoside Rb2 is a triterpene saponin isolated from the root of Panax ginseng (19Oura H. Hiai S. Odaka Y. Yokozawa T. Studies on the biochemical ation of ginseng saponin.J. Biochem. 1975; 77: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas quercetin 3-O-α-l-Arap is a flavonoid isolated from the aerial parts (leaves) of Alchemilla xanthochlora (Lady’s mantle) (20Fraisse D. Heitz A. Carnat A. Carnat A.P. Lamaison J.L.

Kinetic parameters toward the plant glycosides indicate that these substrates exhibit significantly lower Km (<0.1 mm) and higher catalytic efficiencies (>1500 mm−1 s−1) compared with those of pNP-α-l-Arap (Table 2). By contrast, no activity was observed on an extensive series of β-galactosides from plants and mammals, including human milk (the substrates are listed under “Experimental procedures”). Bga42A (Blon_2016), Bga42B (Blon_2123), and Bga42C (Blon_2416) from B. longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697, and BlGal42A from B. animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04, which are distantly related to BlArap42B (see Fig. 4), did not cleave paeonolide, although they were able to slowly hydrolyze pNP-α-l-Arap (Fig. 1B).Table 1Specific activity (units mg−1 = μmol min−1 mg−1 mg−1) of BlArap42B from B. animalis subsp. lactis BL-04 (wild-type and mutants) and RiArap42B from R. intestinalis M50/1 toward 5 mm pNP-substratesSubstrateBlArap42BRiArap42BWild-typeW345FW358HW345F/W358HpNP-α-l-Arap79.0 ± 0.72.7 ± 0.15.9 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.055.2 ± 2.0pNP-β-d-Galp0.1 ± 0.0NDaND, not detected (<0.05 units mg−1).NDaND, not detected (<0.05 units mg−1).NDaND, not detected (<0.05 units mg−1).0.1 ± 0.0pNP-β-d-Fucp1.9 ± 0.0NDaND, not detected (<0.05 units mg−1).0.7 ± 0.0NDaND, not detected (<0.05 units mg−1).2.6 ± 0.1a ND, not detected (<0.05 units mg−1).

Data collection, refinement, and stereochemical statistics are summarized in Table 3. BlArap42B is a homotrimer of a 701-residues subunit, with three subunits related by a 3-fold axis (Fig. 2A). Each subunit consists of three domains. Domain A is a (β/α)8 barrel containing the catalytic residues. Domain B is a structural domain that packs onto Domain A of the adjacent monomer. Domain C, whose role is unknown, adopts an anti-parallel β-sandwich fold. The first seven residues (Met1–Asp7) and the region Pro663–Thr672 in all six chains, as well as a variable number of residues in the C terminus of each chain (Gly695–Asn701), were disordered and not included in the final model.Table 3Data collection and refinement statistics for BlArap42BData collectionBlArap42BBeamlineKEK-PF BL5AResolution (Å)50.00–2.00 (2.03–2.00)Space groupP41212Unit cell parameters (Å)a = b = 177.95, c = 375.70No. of reflections5,987,058No. of unique reflections400,874 (19,842)Mean I/σ (I)27.7 (3.8)R-sym (%)12.7 (50.2)Completeness (%)100.0 (100.0)Redundancy14.9 (14.6)Refinement Resolution (Å)50.00–2.00 R-factor (%)15.5 R-free (%)19.1No. of atoms Protein atoms (non-hydrogen)32,478 Water molecules3,330R.m.s. deviation bond lengths (Å)0.022R.m.s. deviation bond angles (°)1.972Average B-factors (Å2) Protein atoms26.3 Water47.9Ramachandran plot (%) Favored regions96.0 Allowed regions3.8 Disallowed regions0.2PDB code5XB7 Open table in a new tab Similar to structures of GH42 β-galactosidases, the active sites and the vicinity encompassing the proposed subsites +1 and +2 are formed at the interface of two adjacent monomers in the BlArap42B trimer (18Hidaka M.

Trimeric crystal structure of the glycoside hydrolase family 42 β-galactosidase from Thermus thermophilus A4 and the structure of its complex with galactose.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It was possible to dock an energetically preferred conformation of paeonolide, the preferred substrate for BlArap42B, into the active site with an estimated affinity of −8.8 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 2B). The docked paeonolide molecule makes an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the acetyl oxygen of the aglycon (Fig. 1A) and C2-OH of the Glcp. The Arap ring binds at subsite −1, with distances of 3.3 Å between the catalytic nucleophile Glu311 and the anomeric carbon and 2.9 Å between the catalytic acid/base Glu151 and the glycosidic oxygen, respectively. The Glcp ring bound at subsite +1, is stacking onto Trp252, and C4-OH is hydrogen bonded with Asp249. Furthermore, the aromatic ring of the aglycone and Phe421 from the neighboring monomer are almost parallel, making an aromatic stacking at this position, indicative of the presence of a subsite +2. The structure of BlArap42B was compared with that of the other GH42 enzyme from the same organism (BlGal42A) that has specificity toward β(1,6)/β(1,3)-galactoside linkages and is one of the best characterized enzymes (both biochemically and structurally) among GH42 β-galactosidases (13Viborg A.H. Fredslund F. Katayama T. Nielsen S.K. Svensson B. Kitaoka M. Lo Leggio L. Abou Hachem M. A β1–6/β1–3 galactosidase from Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 gives insight into sub-specificities of β-galactoside catabolism within Bifidobacterium.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94: 1024-1040Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows superimposition of the structures of BlArap42B and BlGal42A in complex with galactose (PDB code 4UNI). From the structural comparison, Glu151 and Glu311 of BlArap42B were inferred as the acid/base catalyst and the catalytic nucleophile, respectively. Although BlArap42B and BlGal42A only share 25% sequence identity their overall structures are very similar as reflected by the root mean square deviation (r.m.s. deviation) for Cα atoms of 1.75 Å when chain A (689/695 residues) of BlGal42A is superimposed on chain A (682/701 residues) of BlArap42B. Remarkably, three residues at the substrate-binding site are either variant or spatially differently located in BlArap42B as compared with BlGal42A (Fig. 3A). Trp345 is phenylalanine in BlGal42A (Phe362) and the aromatic side chain is involved in substrate recognition in subsite −1 by forming a hydrophobic platform for the C4 side of the arabino- or galactopyranoside. The change of a histidine in BlGal42A (His375) to Trp358 restricts the space in subsite −1 around the C6–O6 hydroxymethyl group of galactoside, which is not present in arabinopyranoside (Fig. 3B). Moreover, Trp332 of BlGal42A makes a hydrogen bond to the C6–OH of galactose, and is also proposed to mediate aromatic stacking to substrate at subsite +1 in GH42 β-galactosidases. In contrast, the conformation of the loop containing Trp332 is different in BlArap42B and locates a tryptophan at the corresponding position in the sequence (Trp320, not shown in Fig. 3A), distantly from the active site in space. Instead, a differently located Trp252, which is not conserved in previously characterized GH42 enzymes, is taking the role of stacking platform at subsite +1 in BlArap42B. Additionally, Met268 in BlGal42A replaces Asp249 that in the docked structure of BlAra42B forms a hydrogen bond to the Glcp C4-OH in paeonolide. From the structural comparison with BlGal42A, two non-conserved residues (Trp345 and Trp358) are identified in subsite −1. To examine the role of these residues in relationship to substrate specificity, these single residues were replaced using site-directed mutagenesis with those found in the β-galactosidase (Phe or His). Table 1 shows specific activities of the single (W345F and W358H) and double (W345F/W358H) mutants toward pNP-substrates, the single mutants having more than 10-fold reduced activity on pNP-α-l-Arap and the double mutant being almost inactive. W358H was slightly active on pNP-β-d-Fucp, but none of the mutants showed detectable activity on pNP-β-d-Galp or any of the other pNP-substrates. Clearly, the substrate specificity of the GH42 α-l-arabinopyranosidase was not changed to β-galactosidase by these simple mutations. A phylogenetic and active site sequence motif analysis of GH42 α-l-arabinopyranosidases (subfamily A) and β-galactosidases (subfamily G), divides GH42 into two subfamilies, respectively (Fig. 4). BlArap42B assigns into a distinct uncharacterized clade, group one (G1) in the phylogenetic tree. Based on sequence analysis, it is evident that the two tryptophan residues (Trp345 and Trp358) in BlArap42B are conserved in G1 and subfamily A, and comprise a unique Trp-X12-Trp sequence motif through the active site as compared with subfamily G that includes G2–G4. All of the G2–G4 groups of subfamily G contain at least one characterized β-galactosidase that has a Phe-X12-His motif. Trp252 of BlArap42B in subsite +1 is conserved in G1 but not in G2–G4 (data not shown). The GH42 family has been assumed very homogenous because all hitherto characterized members exhibited β-galactosidase activity despite representing broad diverse taxa. This further indicated active site conservation within the family, where evolution of the molecular machinery was driven toward subtle changes in the plus subsites for fine-tuning subspecificities, e.g. for β(1,6)-, β(1,4)-, or β(1,3)-linked galactosides or N-acetylglucosides (22Godoy A.S.

Although GH42 BlArap42B from B. animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 was unable to hydrolyze synthetic β-galactosides and those from plants, mammalian milk, and host mucin, so far demonstrated as substrates for GH42 β-galactosidases, it was able to hydrolyze, the different yet structurally similar, α-l-arabinopyranosides (Table 1, Table 2 and Fig. 1). BlArap42B effectively released α-l-arabinopyranose from paeonolide and ginsenoside Rb2, both containing an aglycone conjugated to α-l-Arap-(1,6)-β-d-Glcp, but was unable to hydrolyze quercetin 3-O-α-l-Arap. The subsite +1 is apparently specific for the β(1,6)-linked glucoside with Trp252 as a sugar-stacking residue (Fig. 3A), and aromatic residues surrounding this site (Trp358, Phe354, and Phe421) probably make steric clash with the large flavonoid group of quercetin 3-O-α-l-Arap. Thus, BlArap42B have the capabilities to discriminate substrates beyond subsite −1 and demonstrate the potential existence of different α-l-arabinopyranoside subspecificities. Previously characterized bifidobacterial GH42 β-galactosidases tested here did not cleave paeonolide, although they were able to hydrolyze pNP-α-l-Arap (Fig. 1B). BlArap42B is clearly a GH42 α-l-arabinopyranosidase, distinctly different from previously characterized GH42 enzymes. The kcat (240 s−1) and Km (0.074 mm) values of BlArap42B toward its preferred substrate, paeonolide, are in the same range as those of previously characterized GH42 enzymes toward their preferred substrates (13Viborg A.H.

In many cases, the exact component causing the system failure cannot be identified and the cause of failure is masked. Based on Type-II progressively hybrid censored and masked data, the maximum likelihood estimations for unknown parameters and acceleration factor are obtained. In addition, approximate confidence interval and bootstrap confidence interval are presented by using the asymptotic distributions of the maximum likelihood estimations for unknown parameters and bootstrap method, respectively. Finally, the proposed method is illustrated through the simulation studies."
https://openalex.org/W2765925735,"This study sought to examine the sources of inequity in health examination service utilization by women from underdeveloped areas in western China.Based on data from the 5th National Health Service Survey in Shaanxi province, women's utilization of health examination services was examined according to gynecological, cervical smear, and breast examination rates. The equity of health examination service utilization by 15- to 64-year-old women and the factors contributing to inequity were determined using the health concentration index, decomposition of the concentration index, and the horizontal inequity index.The examination rates for gynecological, cervical smear, and breast exams for 15- to 64-year-old women in Shaanxi province were 40.61%, 27.08%, and 24.59%, respectively. The horizontal inequity indices of gynecological, cervical smear, and breast examination rates were 0.0480, 0.0423, and 0.0764, respectively, and each examination rate was higher for wealthy individuals. The contribution rates of economic status to the inequalities in gynecological, cervical smear, and breast examination rates were 65.80%, 74.31%, and 56.49%, respectively. The contribution rates of educational status to the inequalities in gynecological, cervical smear, and breast examination rates were 21.01%, 14.83% and 30.00%, respectively. The contribution rates of age to the inequalities in gynecological, cervical smear, and breast examination rates were 25.77%, 26.55%, and 18.40%, respectively.Women's health examination rates differed between populations with different socio-demographic characteristics. There is pro-wealth inequality in each examination rate. This study found that financial status, age, and education level were the main reasons for the unequal utilization of health examination services."
https://openalex.org/W2766746045,"For a detailed investigation of the degradation of lysine in Phaeobacter inhibens DSM 17395, stable isotope experiments with uniformly 13C labeled L-lysine were carried out with lysine adapted cells and the metabolites were analyzed using GC/MS and HPLC/MS. A non-targeted stable isotope analysis was used which compares labeled and not labeled samples to determine the Mass Isotopomer Distribution not only for known metabolites but for all labeled compounds in our GC/MS analysis. We show that P. inhibens uses at least two parallel pathways for the first degradation steps of lysine. Further investigations identified L-pipecolate as an L-lysine degradation intermediate in P. inhibens. The analysis of HPLC/MS data as well as the labeling data of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates show that L-lysine is not only catabolized directly to acetyl-CoA but also via the ethylmalonyl-CoA-pathway, leading to entry points into the TCA cycle via acetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, and malate. Altogether the presented data give a detailed insight into the catabolization of L-lysine following the fate of 13C labeled carbon via several ways into the TCA cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2767082105,"Background Type 1 diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients were referred for evaluation for chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) based on clinical examination and complaints of activity-related leg pain in the region of the tibialis anterior muscle. Previous studies using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) showed greater deoxygenation during exercise for CECS patients versus healthy controls; however, this comparison has not been done for diabetic CECS patients. Methods We used NIRS to test for differences in oxygenation kinetics for Type 1 diabetic patients diagnosed with (CECS-diabetics, n = 9) versus diabetic patients without (CON-diabetics, n = 10) leg anterior chronic exertional compartment syndrome. Comparisons were also made between non-diabetic CECS patients (n = 11) and healthy controls (CON, n = 10). The experimental protocol consisted of thigh arterial cuff occlusion (AO, 1-minute duration), and treadmill running to reproduce symptoms. NIRS variables generated were resting StO2%, and oxygen recovery following AO. Also, during and following treadmill running the magnitude of deoxygenation and oxygen recovery, respectively, were determined. Results There was no difference in resting StO2% between CECS-diabetics (78.2±12.6%) vs. CON-diabetics (69.1±20.8%), or between CECS (69.3±16.2) vs. CON (75.9±11.2%). However, oxygen recovery following AO was significantly slower for CECS (1.8±0.8%/sec) vs. CON (3.8±1.7%/sec) (P = 0.002); these data were not different between the diabetic groups. StO2% during exercise was lower (greater deoxygenation) for CECS-diabetics (6.3±8.6%) vs. CON-diabetics (40.4±22.0%), and for CECS (11.3±16.8%) vs. CON (34.1±21.2%) (P<0.05 for both). The rate of oxygen recovery post exercise was faster for CECS-diabetics (3.5±2.6%/sec) vs. CON-diabetics (1.4±0.8%/sec) (P = 0.04), and there was a tendency of difference for CECS (3.1±1.4%/sec) vs. CON (1.9±1.3%/sec) (P = 0.05). Conclusion The greater deoxygenation during treadmill running for the CECS-diabetics group (vs. CON-diabetics) is in line with previous studies (and with the present study) that compared non-diabetic CECS patients with healthy controls. Our findings could suggest that NIRS may be useful as a diagnostic tool for assessing Type 1 diabetic patients suspected of CECS."
https://openalex.org/W2765402179,"We have previously engineered new RNase P-based ribozyme variants with improved in vitro catalytic activity. In this study, we employed a novel engineered variant to target a shared mRNA region of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immediate early proteins 1 (IE1) and 2 (IE2), which are essential for the expression of viral early and late genes as well as viral growth. Ribozyme F-R228-IE represents a novel variant that possesses three unique base substitution point mutations at the catalytic domain of RNase P catalytic RNA. Compared to F-M1-IE that is the ribozyme derived from the wild type RNase P catalytic RNA sequence, the functional variant F-R228-IE cleaved the target mRNA sequence in vitro at least 100 times more efficiently. In cultured cells, expression of F-R228-IE resulted in IE1/IE2 expression reduction by 98–99% and in HCMV production reduction by 50,000 folds. In contrast, expression of F-M1-IE resulted in IE1/IE2 expression reduction by less than 80% and in viral production reduction by 200 folds. Studies of the ribozyme-mediated antiviral effects in cultured cells suggest that overall viral early and late gene expression and viral growth were inhibited due to the ribozyme-mediated reduction of HCMV IE1 and IE2 expression. Our results provide direct evidence that engineered RNase P ribozymes, such as F-R228-IE, can serve as a novel class of inhibitors for the treatment and prevention of HCMV infection. Moreover, these results suggest that F-R228-IE, with novel and unique mutations at the catalytic domain to enhance ribozyme activity, can be a candidate for the construction of effective agents for anti-HCMV therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2765610039,"Regeneration of injured skeletal muscles is affected by fibrosis, which can be improved by the administration of angiotensin II (AngII) receptor (ATR) blockers in normotensive animals. However, the role of ATR in skeletal muscle fibrosis in hypertensive organisms has not been investigated yet. The tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar rats (WR) were lacerated and a lentivector encoding a microRNA targeting AngII receptor type 1 (At1) (Lv-mirAT1a) or control (Lv-mirCTL) was injected. The TA muscles were collected after 30 days to evaluate fibrosis by histology and gene expression by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. SHR’s myoblasts were analyzed by RT-qPCR, 48 h after transduction. In the SHR’s TA, AT1 protein expression was 23.5-fold higher than in WR without injury, but no difference was observed in the angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2) protein expression. TA laceration followed by suture (LS) produced fibrosis in the SHR (23.3±8.5%) and WR (7.9±1.5%). Lv-mirAT1 treatment decreased At1 gene expression in 50% and reduced fibrosis to 7% 30 days after. RT-qPCR showed that reduction in At1 expression is due to downregulation of the At1a but not of the At1b. RT-qPCR of myoblasts from SHR transduced with Lv-mirAT1a showed downregulation of the Tgf-b1, Tgf-b2, Smad3, Col1a1, and Col3a1 genes by mirAT1a. In vivo and in vitro studies indicate that hypertension overproduces skeletal muscle fibrosis, and AngII-AT1a signaling is the main pathway of fibrosis in SHR. Moreover, muscle fibrosis can be treated specifically by in loco injection of Lv-mirAT1a without affecting other organs."
https://openalex.org/W2767102083,"After the introduction of a ban on the use of antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) for livestock, the feeding environment, including the composition of animal intestinal microbiota, has changed rapidly. We hypothesized that the microbial genomes have also been affected by this legal prohibition, and investigated an important member of the swine gut microbiota, Lactobacillus salivarius, with a pan-genomic approach. Here, we isolated 21 L. salivarius strains composed of 6 strains isolated before the AGP prohibition (SBPs) and 15 strains isolated after the AGP prohibition (SAPs) at an interval of a decade, and the draft genomes were generated de novo. Several genomic differences between SBPs and SAPs were identified, although the number and function of antibiotic resistance genes were not different. SBPs showed larger genome size and a higher number of orthologs, as well as lower genetic diversity, than SAPs. SBPs had genes associated with the utilization of L-rhamnose and D-tagatose for energy production. Because these sugars are also used in exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis, we tried to identify differences in biofilm formation-associated genes. The genes for the production of EPSs and extracellular proteins were different in terms of amino acid sequences. Indeed, SAPs formed dense biofilm and survived better than SBPs in the swine intestinal environment. These results suggest that SAPs have evolved and adapted to protect themselves from new selection pressure of the swine intestinal microenvironment by forming dense biofilms, adopting a distinct antibiotic resistance strategy. This finding is particularly important to understand the evolutionary changes in host-microbe interaction and provide detailed insight for the development of effective probiotics for livestock."
https://openalex.org/W2766095454,"We studied the interaction between GroES and a single-ring mutant (SR1) of GroEL by the NMR titration of 15N-labeled GroES with SR1 at three different temperatures (20, 25 and 30°C) in the presence of 3 mM ADP in 100 mM KCl and 10 mM MgCl2 at pH 7.5. We used SR1 instead of wild-type double-ring GroEL to precisely control the stoichiometry of the GroES binding to be 1:1 ([SR1]:[GroES]). Native heptameric GroES was very flexible, showing well resolved cross peaks of the residues in a mobile loop segment (residue 17-34) and at the top of a roof hairpin (Asn51) in the heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra. The binding of SR1 to GroES caused the cross peaks to disappear simultaneously, and hence it occurred in a single-step cooperative manner with significant immobilization of the whole GroES structure. The binding was thus entropic with a positive entropy change (219 J/mol/K) and a positive enthalpy change (35 kJ/mol), and the binding constant was estimated at 1.9×105 M-1 at 25°C. The NMR titration in 3 mM ATP also indicated that the binding constant between GroES and SR1 increased more than tenfold as compared with the binding constant in 3 mM ADP. These results will be discussed in relation to the structure and mechanisms of the chaperonin GroEL/GroES complex."
