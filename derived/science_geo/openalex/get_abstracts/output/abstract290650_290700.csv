https://openalex.org/W2031956662,"Geographic character variation in birds is usually attributed to natural selection for phenotypes that reflect locally adapted genetic differences. However, experimental transplants of red-winged blackbird eggs between nests in northern and southern Florida, and from Colorado to Minnesota, show that in this species a significant proportion of the regional differences in nestling development is nongenetic. If natural selection is maintaining the clines of character variation that are observed in adult phenotypes, the genetic and nongenetic components of phenotypic variation must covary."
https://openalex.org/W2052311446,"The Amoco Cadiz oil spill (223,000 metric tons) of March 1978 is the largest and best studied tanker spill in history. Of the total oil lost, 30,000 tons (13.5 percent) rapidly became incorporated into the water column, 18,000 tons (8 percent) were deposited in subtidal sediments, 62,000 tons (28 percent) washed into the intertidal zone, and 67,000 tons (30 percent) evaporated. While still at sea, approximately 10,000 tons of oil were degraded microbiologically. After 3 years, the most obvious effects of the spill have passed, although hydrocarbon concentrations remain elevated in those estuaries and marshes that were initially most heavily oiled."
https://openalex.org/W1978299660,"Nitrogen fixation, apparently by bacterial endosymbionts, is associated with intertwining chains of two species of the diatom Rhizosolenia. In situ fixation rates were enhanced by incubation in the dark, whereas concurrent shipboard experiments either underestimated or did not detect nitrogen fixation. This is the first example of nitrogen fixation associated with a bacteria-diatom symbiosis in the pelagic zone, and it indicates that these systems may contribute a significant amount of ""new"" nitrogen to oligotrophic waters."

Images from satellites operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were used to prepare daily maps of the location of the volcanic dust cloud, which is the largest and longest-lasting one so far observed with satellite imagery."
https://openalex.org/W2028131209,"In experiments in which spectrophotometric reflectance patterns of real leaves were mimicked with mixtures of artists' pigments, leaf color was shown to be a character used by cabbage root flies, before landing on leaves, to discriminate among the host plant cultivars radish, green cabbage, and red cabbage. It may be possible to take advantage of factors that affect leaf color, such as epicuticular bloom, pubescence, and masking of chlorophyll by other pigments, to decrease the attraction of certain pest insects to plants."

https://openalex.org/W1982034089,"Microtektites have been recovered from three horizons in eight middle Eocene to middle Oligocene marine sediment sequences. Five of these occurrences are coeval and of latest Eocene age (37.5 to 38.0 million years ago); three are coeval and of early late Eocene age (38.5 to 39.5 million years ago); and three are of middle Oligocene age (31 to 32 million years ago). In addition, rare probable microtektites have been found in sediments with ages of about 36.0 to 36.5 million years. The microtektite horizon at 37.5 to 38.0 million years can be correlated with the North American tektite-strewn field, which has a fission track age (minimum) of 34 to 35 million years and a paleomagnetic age of 37.5 to 38.0 million years. There is no evidence for mass faunal extinctions at any of the microtektite horizons. Many of the distinct faunal changes that occurred in the middle Eocene to middle Oligocene can be related to the formation of the Antarctic ice sheet and the associated cooling phenomena and intensification of bottom currents that led to large-scale dissolution of calcium carbonate and erosion, which created areally extensive hiatuses in the deep-sea sediment records. The occurrence of microtektite horizons of several ages and the lack of evidence for faunal extinctions suggest that the effects of extraterrestrial bolide impacts may be unimportant in the biologic realm during middle Eocene to middle Oligocene time."
https://openalex.org/W2089220935,"Six species of Drosophila were tested for tolerance to the mushroom toxin alpha-amanitin, a potent inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. Three nonmycophagous species-D. melanogaster, D. immigrans, and D. pseudoobscura-showed very low survival and long development times in the presence of amanitin. Three mycophagous species-D. putrida, D. recens, and D. tripunctata-showed little or no sensitivity. Analysis in vitro indicated that this tolerance is not based on alteration of the molecular structure of RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1977823273,"Fasting doves entered shallow torpor during nocturnal sleep. Body temperature dropped lower each successive night by 1 degrees to 3 degrees in parallel with diminished rapid-eye-movement sleep until torpor was composed almost entirely of slow-wave sleep at a body temperature of 30 degrees to 32 degrees C. Shallow torpor in doves, as in mammals, thus appears to lie on a metabolic continuum with sleep."
https://openalex.org/W1975820279,"Research in microfabrication not only serves the microelectronics industry but also can provide research tools for studying the behavior of matter at submicrometer dimensions. A variety of techniques including optical, x-ray, and electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching can be used to make structures, devices, and arrays only hundreds of atoms across. Microfabrication techniques have been applied to experiments on surface-enhanced Raman scattering, transport in one-dimensional conductors, and macroscopic quantum tunneling. Recent progress is extending these techniques to scales of less than 100 angstroms."

https://openalex.org/W2004731114,"Chitin, which is widely distributed among life forms, is well documented in the coelenterate class Hydrozoa and is contained in one member of class Scyphozoa. In class Anthozoa, hard corals synthesize it but soft corals do not. Chitin was identified by infrared spectrophotometry in the trochoid shell of the actinian Stylobates. It constitutes 1.7 percent of the shell by weight, the rest probably being protein. The ability of sea anemones to synthesize chitin is there by confirmed."

Marx's briefing ""Bar Harbor investigation reveals no fraud"" (News and Comment, 17 June, p. 1254), the report of the investigating committee was incorrectly quoted to have said that Hoppe ""cannot rule out the possibility that the embryos were switched before implantation."" What the report actually says is, ""Nevertheless, he [Hoppe] could not rule out the possibility that deliberate switching of young mice in experimental litters took place."""
