https://openalex.org/W1995427315,"Plant trichomes can act as efjective defenses against herbivores, but at least one species of ithomiid butterfly, Mechanitis isthmia, has evolved a unique adaptation for avoiding the trichomes on its spiny Solanum hosts. The larvae are gregarious all together they spin a fine silk scaffolding over the tops of the spines on which they can crawl and feed in safety."

Eustatic rise of sea level is probably responsible."

https://openalex.org/W2002442467,Experiments conducted aboard Apollo 17 by astronaut Ronald E. Evans showed that in uncovered liquids convection driven by surface tension can occur at lower temperature gradients in low gravity (about 10-8g) than in 1g. In completely confined fluids (no liquid-gas interface) vibrations caused by spacecraft and astronaut movements increased the heat transfer considerably over the pure conduction case.
https://openalex.org/W1994918974,"The paper discusses several discoveries made in the study of lunar material. In the examination of the effects of solar wind implantations the topics covered include (1) solar wind radiation damage parameters and their aging characteristics, (2) the theory of the ancient solar wind, (3) the solar wind sputtering erosion rate, (4) the physicochemical properties of amorphous coatings, (5) maturity indexes and the macroscopic properties of the lunar regolith, (6) solar wind gas bubbles, (7) the composition of very heavy nuclei in the contemporary solar wind, and (8) track aging processes. Conclusions are drawn from the results about other extraterrestrial features such as the parent bodies of the meteorites, early solar nebulas, and interstellar clouds."
https://openalex.org/W2016797610,"Specimens of myctophid fish preserved for 1 month in formalin, ethyl alcohol, and isopropyl alcohol had higher concentrations of cadmium, copper, zinc, and sometimes lead, and lower concentrations of mercury and sometimes lead, than did unpreserved frozen specimens. Properties of the preservatives and species differences in fish tissues both influence these metal concentrations. Maximum concentrations of some metals in preserved specimens appear to be attained within a month, while concentrations of others may continue to increase for years. Metal tags or other materials in the preservative may cause higher maximum concentrations than the preservatives alone. Comparisons of concentrations of metals between museum specimens and unpreserved (frozen) specimens must be considered unreliable until the changes resulting from preservation are understood."

https://openalex.org/W2056299015,"Odoriferous glands of Tribolium confusum produce volatile compounds which are stored in special reservoirs. Besides the previously reported 2-methyl- and 2-ethyl-1,4-benzoquinones, a new compound, 1-pentadecene, was isolated. The acyclic C(14)H(26)O ketone previously reported was not present. 1-Pentadecene is thought to facilitate absorption of the admixed quinones by Tribolium enemies."
https://openalex.org/W1977331366,"Mercury has a heavily cratered surface cotntaining basins up to at least 1300 kilometers diameter flooded with mare-like material. Many features are closely similar to those on the moon, but significant structural differences exist. Major chemical differentiation before termination of accretion is implied."
https://openalex.org/W1963494388,"Non Nok Tha is a prehistoric site in northeast Thailand. The radiocarbon dates suggest that it was first occupied by at least 3500 B.C., and possibly as early as 5000 B.C. The deepest levels contain unexpectedly early evidence for rice cultivation and bronze casting. Multivariate and cultural analyses of the bovine bones suggest that the first inhabitants raised domesticated cattle. This is among the earliest evidence for bovine domestication known."
