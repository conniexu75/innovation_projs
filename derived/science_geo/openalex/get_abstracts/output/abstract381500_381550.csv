https://openalex.org/W2017779665,"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process by which cytoplasmic proteins and organelles are catabolized. During starvation, the protein TOR (target of rapamycin), a nutrient-responsive kinase, is inhibited, and this induces autophagy. In autophagy, double-membrane autophagosomes envelop and sequester intracellular components and then fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, which degrade their contents to regenerate nutrients. Current models of autophagy terminate with the degradation of the autophagosome cargo in autolysosomes, but the regulation of autophagy in response to nutrients and the subsequent fate of the autolysosome are poorly understood. Here we show that mTOR signalling in rat kidney cells is inhibited during initiation of autophagy, but reactivated by prolonged starvation. Reactivation of mTOR is autophagy-dependent and requires the degradation of autolysosomal products. Increased mTOR activity attenuates autophagy and generates proto-lysosomal tubules and vesicles that extrude from autolysosomes and ultimately mature into functional lysosomes, thereby restoring the full complement of lysosomes in the cell-a process we identify in multiple animal species. Thus, an evolutionarily conserved cycle in autophagy governs nutrient sensing and lysosome homeostasis during starvation."
https://openalex.org/W2052388837,"Cellular senescence is a recognized mechanism of tumour suppression; however, its contribution to other pathologies is not well understood. We show that the matricellular protein CCN1 (also known as CYR61; cysteine-rich protein 61), which is dynamically expressed at sites of wound repair, can induce fibroblast senescence by binding to integrin alpha(6)beta(1) and the heparan sulphate proteoglycans (receptors involved in cell adhesion). CCN1 induces DNA damage response pathways and activates p53 and the RAC1-NOX1 complex, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). This results in the ROS-dependent activation of the p16(INK4a)/pRb pathway, leading to senescence and concomitant expression of antifibrotic genes. Senescent fibroblasts accumulate in granulation tissues of healing cutaneous wounds and express antifibrotic genes in wild-type mice. These processes are lost in knockin mice that express a senescence-defective Ccn1 mutant, resulting in exacerbated fibrosis. Topical application of CCN1 protein to wounds reverses these defects. Thus, fibroblast senescence is a CCN1-dependent wound healing response in cutaneous injury that functions to curb fibrosis during tissue repair."

https://openalex.org/W2023843317,"The biogenesis, maintenance and function of primary cilia are controlled through intraflagellar transport (IFT) driven by two kinesin-2 family members, the heterotrimeric KIF3A/KIF3B/KAP complex and the homodimeric KIF17 motor. How these motors and their cargoes gain access to the ciliary compartment is poorly understood. Here, we identify a ciliary localization signal (CLS) in the KIF17 tail domain that is necessary and sufficient for ciliary targeting. Similarities between the CLS and classic nuclear localization signals (NLSs) suggest that similar mechanisms regulate nuclear and ciliary import. We hypothesize that ciliary targeting of KIF17 is regulated by a ciliary-cytoplasmic gradient of the small GTPase Ran, with high levels of GTP-bound Ran (RanGTP) in the cilium. Consistent with this, cytoplasmic expression of GTP-locked Ran(G19V) disrupts the gradient and abolishes ciliary entry of KIF17. Furthermore, KIF17 interacts with the nuclear import protein importin-beta2 in a manner dependent on the CLS and inhibited by RanGTP. We propose that Ran has a global role in regulating cellular compartmentalization by controlling the shuttling of cytoplasmic proteins into nuclear and ciliary compartments."

We tested association of 2.5 million SNPs with platelet aggregation responses to three agonists (ADP, epinephrine and collagen) in two cohorts of European ancestry (N<or=2,753 in the Framingham Heart Study, N<or=1,238 in the Genetic Study of Atherosclerosis Risk). We identified associations of seven loci with platelet aggregation near or within GP6 (P=4.6x10(-13)), PEAR1 (P=3.4x10(-12)), ADRA2A (P=3.3x10(-11)), PIK3CG (P=3.1x10(-9)), JMJD1C (P=1.6x10(-8)), MRVI1 (P=2.0x10(-8)) and SHH (P=4.5x10(-8)). Six of these loci replicated at P<0.05 in an additional African-American cohort (N<or=840 in the Genetic Study of Atherosclerosis Risk). These results provide insights into platelet aggregation pathways and may suggest new antiplatelet therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2038336599,"CLEC-2 has been described recently as playing crucial roles in thrombosis/hemostasis, tumor metastasis, and lymphangiogenesis. The snake venom rhodocytin is known as a strong platelet activator, and we have shown that this effect is mediated by CLEC-2 (Suzuki-Inoue, K., Fuller, G. L., García, A., Eble, J.

Mice deficient in podoplanin, which is also expressed on the surface of lymphatic endothelial cells, show abnormal patterns of lymphatic vessel formation. In this study, we report on the generation and phenotype of CLEC-2-deficient mice. These mice are lethal at the embryonic/neonatal stages associated with disorganized and blood-filled lymphatic vessels and severe edema. Moreover, by transplantation of fetal liver cells from Clec-2−/− or Clec-2+/+ embryos, we were able to demonstrate that CLEC-2 is involved in thrombus stabilization in vitro and in vivo, possibly through homophilic interactions without apparent increase in bleeding tendency. We propose that CLEC-2 could be an ideal novel target protein for an anti-platelet drug, which inhibits pathological thrombus formation but not physiological hemostasis.

We propose that CLEC-2 could be an ideal novel target protein for an anti-platelet drug, which inhibits pathological thrombus formation but not physiological hemostasis. The C-type lectin receptors are now established as multifunctional molecules in the field of cell adhesion, endocytosis, and pathogen recognition (1Cambi A. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin.

CLEC-2 (C-type lectin-like receptor-2) has been described recently as playing crucial roles in thrombosis/hemostasis, tumor metastasis, and lymphangiogenesis based on the following findings, reported mainly by us. (i) The snake venom rhodocytin is known as a strong platelet activator, and this effect has been shown to be mediated by CLEC-2 (3Suzuki-Inoue K. Fuller G.L. García A. Eble J.A. Pöhlmann S. Inoue O.

(iii) Mice deficient in podoplanin, which is expressed on the surface of lymphatic endothelial cells, show defects in lymphatic vessel pattern formation (6Schacht V. Ramirez M.I. Hong Y.K.

We have also reported that an anti-podoplanin antibody that blocks CLEC-2/podoplanin interaction inhibits tumor metastasis in an experimental lung metastasis model in mice, suggesting that CLEC-2 facilitates tumor metastasis through association with podoplanin (7Kato Y. Kaneko M.K. Kunita A. Ito H. Kameyama A. Ogasawara S. Matsuura N. Hasegawa Y. Suzuki-Inoue K. Inoue O. Ozaki Y. Narimatsu H. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 54-61PubMed Google Scholar). However, podoplanin is also expressed on the surface of lymphatic endothelial cells, kidney podocytes, and type I alveolar cells (8Schacht V. Dadras S.S. Johnson L.A. Jackson D.G. Hong Y.K. Detmar M.

We and others found previously that podoplanin on the surface of lymphatic endothelial cells also induces platelet aggregation (4Suzuki-Inoue K. Kato Y. Inoue O. Kaneko M.K. Mishima K. Yatomi Y.

The physiological significance of this receptor/ligand interaction remains to be elucidated because lymphatic endothelial cells are not in direct contact with platelets under physiological conditions. However, it may be of great importance during organ development or under pathological conditions. It was reported previously that podoplanin-deficient mice have defects in lymphatic vessel pattern formation (6Schacht V. Ramirez M.I. Hong Y.K. Hirakawa S. Feng D. Harvey N. Williams M. Dvorak A.M. Dvorak H.F. Oliver G. Detmar M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3546-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling molecules Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase) and SLP-76 (SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa) in platelets are requisites for rhodocytin-induced platelet activation mediated through CLEC-2 (3Suzuki-Inoue K. Fuller G.L. García A. Eble J.A. Pöhlmann S. Inoue O. Gartner T.K. Hughan S.C. Pearce A.C. Laing G.D. Theakston R.D. Schweighoffer E. Zitzmann N. Morita T. Tybulewicz V.L. Ozaki Y. Watson S.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and regulate blood and lymphatic vascular separation, although these signaling molecules are not detected in the endothelium (10Abtahian F. Guerriero A. Sebzda E. Lu M.M. Zhou R. Mocsai A. Myers E.E. Huang B. Jackson D.G. Ferrari V.A. Tybulewicz V. Lowell C.A. Lepore J.J. Koretzky G.A. Kahn M.L. Science. 2003; 299: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). This finding implies that Syk and SLP-76 work by way of blood cells. Moreover, blood/lymphatic misconnection is observed in mice deficient in endothelial cell O-glycan (11Fu J. Gerhardt H. McDaniel J.M. Xia B. Liu X. Ivanciu L. Ny A. Hermans K. Silasi-Mansat R.

Invest. 2008; 118: 3725-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the presence of which is required for podoplanin-induced platelet aggregation (4Suzuki-Inoue K. Kato Y. Inoue O. Kaneko M.K.

Taken together, these findings lead to a hypothesis that podoplanin-induced platelet activation through CLEC-2 may regulate proper formation of lymphatic vessels. To address this issue, the generation of CLEC-2-deficient mice has been ardently awaited. The powerful platelet-activating ability of CLEC-2 and its relatively specific expression in platelets and megakaryocytes imply that CLEC-2 also plays an important role in thrombosis and hemostasis. However, neither podoplanin nor rhodocytin can stimulate platelets within blood vessels. In addition, CLEC-2 ligands that play a role in thrombosis and hemostasis are not known. Therefore, the generation of CLEC-2-deficient mice has been awaited to reveal a role for CLEC-2 in thrombosis and hemostasis. In this study, for the first time, we report on the generation and phenotype of CLEC-2-deficient mice. These mice are lethal at the embryonic/neonatal stage with blood/lymphatic misconnections. Moreover, by transplantation of fetal liver cells from Clec-2−/− or Clec-2+/+ embryos, we were able to demonstrate that CLEC-2 is involved in thrombus stabilization, possibly through homophilic interactions. A targeting vector to generate CLEC-2-deficient mice was designed so that part of exon 1 flanked by two loxP sites could be deleted by expression of Cre protein (supplemental Fig. 1A).

Nine ES clones were obtained containing the appropriately targeted disrupted allele and injected into blastocysts. Germ line transmission confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting was obtained in six independent ES cell clones (hereafter referred to as Clec-2flox/+). We crossed a Clec-2flox/+ mouse with a mouse that systemically expresses Cre recombinase to generate Clec-2+/− mice. The heterozygous mice were phenotypically normal and were bred to obtain homozygous mice for the allele containing the disrupted exon 1 of the Clec-2 gene. For analysis of genotypes of Clec-2 floxed mice, DNA was subjected to 30 cycles of amplification, with each cycle consisting of 20 s at 94 °C and 7 min at 62 °C, followed by an extension of 10 min at 74 °C on a thermal cycler using the long F2 and exon R primers, and PCR products were separated by 7.5% acrylamide gels (supplemental Fig. 1A). The WT allele gave a 229-bp band, whereas the floxed allele gave a 269-bp band by primers b and c (supplemental Fig. 1C). For analysis of genotypes of CLEC-2 null mice, DNA was subjected to 30 cycles of amplification, with each cycle consisting of 20 s at 94 °C and 7 min at 60 °C, followed by an extension of 10 min at 74 °C on a thermal cycler using the long F1 and exon R (733-bp band) primers for the WT allele and the neo R and long F2 (871-bp band) primers for the deleted allele, and PCR products were separated on 0.8% agarose gels (supplemental Fig. 1, A and D). embryonic stem wild-type fluorescein isothiocyanate embryonic day phosphate-buffered saline glycoprotein phycoerythrin von Willebrand factor bovine serum albumin tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone Fc receptor. To visualize functional lymphatic vessels, FITC-dextran (Sigma; 2000 kDa; 8 mg/ml in PBS) was injected subcutaneously into the back of the embryonic forelimb. Lymphatic flow carrying FITC-dextran in embryos was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (12Hirashima M. Sano K. Morisada T. Murakami K. Rossant J. Suda T. Dev. Biol. 2008; 316: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Embryos were photographed at autopsy. For routine histology, embryos were fixed in 3.7% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistochemistry, deparaffinized sections were stained with rabbit anti-mouse LYVE-1 antibody (Abcam Inc.) using Simplestain® mouse MAX-PO (rabbit; Nichirei Corp.) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. For confocal microscopy, embryos (E17.5) were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature; washed; and cryoprotected with 10% sucrose for 2 h, 20% sucrose for 2 h, and 40% sucrose overnight. The samples were then mounted in OCT (optimal cutting temperature) compound (Sakura Finetek). Cryosections (∼10 μm) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse LYVE-1 antibody (R&D Systems), rat anti-mouse PECAM-1 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1) monoclonal antibody (clone MEC13.3, BD Biosciences), and Cy3-conjugated anti-α-smooth muscle actin monoclonal antibody (clone 1A4, Sigma); developed with Cy5-labeled streptavidin (Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG (Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature; and mounted with ProLong Gold mounting medium. The samples were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy using an Olympus FV-1000 microscope. For immunohistochemical analysis of embryonic back skin, whole embryos were dissected between E14.5 and E17.5 and fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. The back skin was peeled off and further fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Tissues were washed twice with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBS/T) at 4 °C for 30 min; blocked in PBS/T containing 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h; and stained overnight with American hamster anti-mouse PECAM-1 (clone 2H8, Chemicon), rabbit anti-mouse LYVE-1 (RELIATech), and rat anti-mouse TER-119 (clone TER-119, BD Biosciences) antibodies in blocking solution at 4 °C. Tissues were washed with PBS/T for 30 min three times at 4 °C and twice at room temperature, followed by overnight staining with Cy3-conjugated anti-American hamster IgG and Cy5-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) in blocking solution at 4 °C. Tissues were washed with PBS/T for 30 min three times at 4 °C and twice at room temperature. The back skin was flat-mounted on slide glasses in ProLong Antifade (Invitrogen). Confocal microscopy was carried out on an Olympus FV-1000 microscope. CLEC-2-deficient irradiated chimeric mice were generated as follows. Seven- to ten-week-old C57BL/6 male mice that had been kept on acidified water for one week and then on 0.017% enrofloxacin in water for 3 days were given two irradiations of 500 rads from a 60Co source 3 h apart (13Turner M. Mee P.J. Costello P.S. Williams O. Price A.A. Duddy L.P. Furlong M.T. Geahlen R.L. Tybulewicz V.L. Nature. 1995; 378: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The mice were then rescued by intravenous injection of 1.0 × 106 fetal liver cells from Clec-2−/− or control embryos at E13.5. The reconstituted mice were kept on 0.017% enrofloxacin in water for 3 weeks following irradiation and were used for experiments no fewer than 7 weeks following irradiation. Mice were killed with diethyl ether, and blood was drawn by postcava puncture and taken into 100 μl of acid/citrate/dextrose. Washed murine platelets were obtained by centrifugation as described previously using prostacyclin to prevent activation during the isolation procedure (14Suzuki-Inoue K. Inoue O. Frampton J. Watson S.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 1367-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Washed platelets were resuspended in modified Tyrode’s buffer (14Suzuki-Inoue K. Inoue O. Frampton J. Watson S.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 1367-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) at the indicated cell densities. The recombinant extracellular domain of mouse CLEC-2 expressed as a dimeric rabbit immunoglobulin Fc domain fusion protein (mCLEC-2-rFc2) was generated as described previously (4Suzuki-Inoue K. Kato Y. Inoue O. Kaneko M.K. Mishima K. Yatomi Y. Yamazaki Y. Narimatsu H. Ozaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A purified polyclonal antibody specific for mouse CLEC-2 was purified by protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) from the serum of a Japanese White rabbit after six immunizations with mCLEC-2-rFc2. Western blotting was performed as described previously (14Suzuki-Inoue K. Inoue O. Frampton J. Watson S.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 1367-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed murine platelets (2.0 × 108/ml) were dissolved in SDS sample buffer, separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred, and Western-blotted with anti-mouse CLEC-2 antibody. Rhodocytin was purified as described previously (15Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Poly(PHG), a specific GPVI agonist, was generated as described previously (16Inoue O. Suzuki-Inoue K. Shinoda D. Umeda Y. Uchino M. Takasaki S. Ozaki Y. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 300 μl of washed platelets (2.0 × 108/ml) from CLEC-2 or WT chimeras was used for aggregation studies. The washed platelets were stimulated by rhodocytin (20 nm), collagen (1 μg/μl; Nycomed), U46619 (0.5 μm; Merck), ADP (5 μm; MC Medical), and PAR-4 (50 μm; Sigma), and platelet aggregation was monitored by light transmission using a Born aggregometer (PA-100, Kowa) with high speed stirring (1200 rpm) at 37 °C for 10 min. Whole blood drawn from mice as described above was diluted 15-fold using modified Tyrode’s buffer. 25 μl of the diluted whole blood was incubated with Cy2-labeled anti-mouse CLEC-2, Cy2-labeled control rabbit IgG, PE-labeled control rat IgG (Emfret Analytics), FITC-labeled control rat IgG (Emfret Analytics), FITC-labeled anti-mouse GPVI (clone JAQ-1, Emfret Analytics), FITC-labeled anti-mouse integrin αIIb (Emfret Analytics), PE-labeled anti-mouse GPIbα (Emfret Analytics), FITC-labeled anti-mouse PECAM-1 (BD Biosciences), PE-labeled anti-mouse integrin α2 (clone HMα2, BD Biosciences), FITC-labeled control hamster IgG (Serotec), and FITC-labeled integrin β1 (Serotec) antibodies for 15 min at room temperature. For analysis of activated integrin αIIbβ3, 25 μl of diluted whole blood was stimulated with the indicated platelet agonists (20 nm rhodocytin, 20 μg/ml poly(PHG), 50 μg/ml collagen, 50 μm U46619, 40 μm ADP, and 100 μm PAR-4) for 5 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of anti-activated mouse integrin αIIbβ3 (clone Jon-A, Emfret Analytics) for 5 min at room temperature. For analysis of CD62P expression, 25 μl of washed platelets (5 × 107/ml) was used. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 400 μl of PBS, and the samples were then analyzed using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) and a CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For detection of soluble mCLEC-2-rFc2 binding to platelets, WT or CLEC-2-deficient platelets (3 × 108/ml) were stimulated with or without 50 μm PAR-4 peptides for 5 min under non-stirring conditions. They were then incubated with 50 μg/ml recombinant mCLEC-2-rFc2 or rFc2 for 20 min. After washing with modified Tyrode’s buffer, these cells were resuspended with 100 μl of PBS and stained with 2 μl of FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (BD Biosciences) for 15 min. Stained cells were analyzed immediately using a FACScan and CellQuest software. Where indicated, quantification of the soluble protein binding was performed using median fluorescence intensity, and the data were expressed as the means ± S.E. Washed platelets (3 × 108/ml) from WT or CLEC-2 chimeras were stimulated with or without 20 nm rhodocytin, 20 μg/ml poly(PHG), or 50 μg/ml collagen for 5 min under non-stirring conditions. After spinning down the platelets, the serotonin concentration of 15 μl of the supernatant was measured using a 5-hydroxytryptamine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (DLD Diagnostika GmbH) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Coverslips were coated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μg/ml laminin, 50 μg/ml collagen, 200 μg/ml fibrinogen, 100 μg/ml vWF, 250 μg/ml rFc2, or 250 μg/ml mCLEC-2-rFc2. After washing twice with PBS, the coverslips were blocked with 1% fatty acid-free purified BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature and then rinsed with modified Tyrode’s buffer. BSA-coated coverslips were prepared as a negative control. Washed murine platelets (3.0 × 107/ml) were seeded on the coverslips for 30 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of 10 μm ADP. After removal of unbound platelets, coverslips were washed with modified Tyrode’s buffer, and adherent platelets were then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and stained with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin for 2 h as described previously (17Suzuki-Inoue K. Yatomi Y. Asazuma N. Kainoh M. Tanaka T. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Blood. 2001; 98: 3708-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Platelets were visualized using an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX71, Olympus) equipped with a 100×/1.30 objective lens, a monochromatic light source, and a DP-70 digital camera (Olympus). At least six images from two independent experiments were chosen at random per experiment and analyzed by two individuals, one of whom performed the analysis under blind conditions. Adherent platelets were counted (0.006 mm2/image), and the platelet surface area was analyzed using NIH Image for Macintosh. Statistical significance was evaluated by Student’s t test. In each case, p values <0.05 were taken as the minimum to indicate statistical significance. Whole blood from WT or CLEC-2 chimeras was collected into a syringe and anticoagulated with 40 μm PPACK and 5 units/ml heparin. Capillary tubes (0.3 × 1.2 mm, 50 mm long) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μg/ml collagen. Capillaries were washed and blocked with PBS containing 2% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. They were then rinsed with modified Tyrode’s buffer supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 unit/ml heparin and connected to a syringe filled with the anticoagulated blood that had been pretreated with 5 μm 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide for 30 min. Blood was perfused into capillaries at 2000 s−1, and adherent platelets were visualized using a fluorescence video microscope (IX71). Where indicated, 10 μm ADP was co-infused with the anticoagulated blood shortly before entrance into the capillary tubes. Movie data were converted into sequential photo images. For measurement of thrombus volume, capillaries with thrombus were visualized using an Olympus FV-1000 confocal microscope. The data were analyzed using FluoView software (Olympus), and thrombus volume was expressed as integrated fluorescence intensity. Platelet concentrations were counted 1 week before the experiments so that platelet counts were same between WT and CLEC-2 chimeras. To visually analyze thrombus formation in the microcirculation of the mesentery in living animals, we used in vivo laser injury and visualization techniques developed through modification of conventional methods (18Law D.A.

Hosoya Y. Ohsugi M. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Sugiura S. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 710-721PubMed Google Scholar). Male mice were anesthetized by injection with urethane (1.5 g/kg), and a small incision was made so that the mesentery could be observed without being exteriorized. FITC-dextran (5 mg/kg of body weight) was injected into mice to visualize cell dynamics, whereas hematoporphyrin (1.8 mg/kg for capillary thrombi and 2.5 mg/kg for arterioles) was injected to produce reactive oxygen species upon laser irradiation. Blood cell dynamics and production of thrombi were visualized during laser excitation (488-nm wavelength, 30-milliwatt power). Sequential images were obtained for 20 s at 30 frames/s using a spinning-disk confocal microscope (CSU-X1, Yokogawa Electronics) and an electron-multiplying charged coupled device camera (iXon, Andor Technology). Platelet concentrations were counted 1 week before the experiments so that platelet counts were same between WT and CLEC-2 chimeras. Mice were anesthetized with 3.5% Sevoflurane and 0.5 liter/min O2 through a face mask throughout the experiment. We laid each mouse on its stomach and arranged the tail horizontally with the tip hanging over the edge of the bench. We then cut off the tip of the tail (1 mm in length) with a sharp razor blade. The volume of blood lost during the 20-min experiment was measured. After surgical suture of the tail wound, we let the mice recover from anesthesia. Platelet concentrations were counted 1 week before the experiments so that platelet counts were same between WT and CLEC-2 chimeras. The recombinant extracellular domain of human or mouse CLEC-2 expressed as a dimeric human or rabbit immunoglobulin Fc domain fusion protein (hCLEC-2-rFc2 and mCLEC-2-rFc2) was generated as described previously (4Suzuki-Inoue K. Kato Y. Inoue O. Kaneko M.K. Mishima K. Yatomi Y. Yamazaki Y. Narimatsu H. Ozaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A specific homophilic interaction between hCLEC-2-rFc2 or mCLEC-2-rFc2 was analyzed using a Biacore X system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Ligands (αvβ3, α2β1, CD62P, LIMP-II (lysosomal integral membrane protein-II), TSP-1, PEAR-1 (platelet endothelial aggregation receptor 1) (all purchased from R&D Systems), hCLEC-2-rFc2, and mCLEC-2-rFc2) were covalently coupled to a CM5 chip (Biacore AB) using an amine coupling kit (Biacore AB) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (20Inoue O.

Regeneration of the protein-coated surfaces was achieved by running 10 μl of 10 mm HCl thorough the flow cell at 20 μl/min twice. A control surface was reacted with rFc2 and then blocked with ethanolamine. hCLEC-2-rFc2 or mCLEC-2-rFc2 in 10 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20 (pH 7.4) (Biacore AB) at several concentrations was perfused over the control surface or an immobilized hCLEC-2-rFc2 or mCLEC-2-rFc2 surface at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C, and the resonance changes were recorded. The response from the hCLEC-2-rFc2 or mCLEC-2-rFc2 surface was subtracted from that of the control surface. The dissociation constants (Kd) were determined using BIAevaluation software. A targeting vector to generate CLEC-2-deficient mice was designed so that part of exon 1 flanked by two loxP sites could be deleted by expression of Cre protein (supplemental Fig. 1A). Nine ES clones were obtained, which contained the appropriately targeted allele, and were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Southern blot analysis confirmed the presence of the targeted locus (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). Germ line transmission was obtained from six independent ES cell clones (hereafter referred to as Clec-2flox/+). We crossed a Clec-2flox/+ mouse with a mouse that systemically expresses Cre recombinase to generate Clec-2+/− mice. Germ line transmission was confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting. The heterozygous mice were phenotypically normal and were bred to obtain homozygous mice for the allele containing the disrupted exon 1 of the Clec-2 gene. Genotype analysis of embryos from heterozygous intercrosses at E13.5 showed the expected numbers of Clec-2−/− embryos. However, the percentage of the knock-out embryos dropped to less than expected at E15.5 (supplemental Table 1). We analyzed genotypes of 326 newborn mice and found that the percentage of the knock-out mice was only 9.8% (supplemental Table 1). Moreover, most of the Clec-2−/− pups died shortly after birth, and only two Clec-2−/− mice of 326 mice survived after 8 weeks of age, suggesting that Clec-2−/− mice are lethal at the embryonic/neonatal stage. There were fewer heterozygotes than predicted by Mendelian inheritance (supplemental Table 1). We do not have any direct evidence to explain this phenomenon. It is plausible that the heterozygotes may also have some developmental abnormality related to lymphatic vessels that causes intrauterine death of some pups. This needs further investigation. To investigate the cause of the embryonic or neonatal lethality of CLEC-2-deficient mice, we examined Clec-2−/− embryos. Cutaneous hemorrhagic appearance was the most striking phonotype observed in CLEC-2-lacking embryos (Fig. 1A), which was first noted at E12.5–E13.5. Edema was observed in the back skin in CLEC-2-deficient embryos (Fig. 1A, arrow), implying impaired lymphatic drainage. We assessed lymphatic function by infusing 2000-kDa FITC-dextran into embryonic limbs. Lymphangiography showed normal collecting lymphatic vessels immediately after dye infusion in WT mice at E17.5 (Fig. 1B, upper inlet, arrow), whereas dye uptake was not found even 10 min after injection (lower inlet), suggesting functional defects in lymphatic dr"

We achieved epidermal-specific infection using small generic promoters of existing lentiviral short hairpin RNA libraries, thus enabling rapid assessment of gene function as well as complex genetic interactions in skin morphogenesis and disease in vivo. We adapted this technology to devise a new quantitative method for ascertaining whether a gene confers a growth advantage or disadvantage in skin tumorigenesis. Using alpha1-catenin as a model, we uncover new insights into its role as a widely expressed tumor suppressor and reveal physiological interactions between Ctnna1 and the Hras1-Mapk3 and Trp53 gene pathways in regulating skin cell proliferation and apoptosis. Our study illustrates the strategy and its broad applicability for investigations of tissue morphogenesis, lineage specification and cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2041484954,"Background Coral reefs are hotspots of biodiversity, yet processes of diversification in these ecosystems are poorly understood. The environmental heterogeneity of coral reef environments could be an important contributor to diversification, however, evidence supporting ecological speciation in corals is sparse. Here, we present data from a widespread coral species that reveals a strong association of host and symbiont lineages with specific habitats, consistent with distinct, sympatric gene pools that are maintained through ecologically-based selection. Methodology/Principal Findings Populations of a common brooding coral, Seriatopora hystrix, were sampled from three adjacent reef habitats (spanning a ∼30 m depth range) at three locations on the Great Barrier Reef (n = 336). The populations were assessed for genetic structure using a combination of mitochondrial (putative control region) and nuclear (three microsatellites) markers for the coral host, and the ITS2 region of the ribosomal DNA for the algal symbionts (Symbiodinium). Our results show concordant genetic partitioning of both the coral host and its symbionts across the different habitats, independent of sampling location. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates that coral populations and their associated symbionts can be highly structured across habitats on a single reef. Coral populations from adjacent habitats were found to be genetically isolated from each other, whereas genetic similarity was maintained across similar habitat types at different locations. The most parsimonious explanation for the observed genetic partitioning across habitats is that adaptation to the local environment has caused ecological divergence of distinct genetic groups within S. hystrix."
https://openalex.org/W2043242731,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a critical enzyme in neuronal physiology; however, it is not yet known whether it has any specific role in presynaptic function. We found that GSK3 phosphorylates a residue on the large GTPase dynamin I (Ser-774) both in vitro and in primary rat neuronal cultures. This was dependent on prior phosphorylation of Ser-778 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5. Using both acute inhibition with pharmacological antagonists and silencing of expression with short hairpin RNA, we found that GSK3 was specifically required for activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) but not clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Moreover we found that the specific phosphorylation of Ser-774 on dynamin I by GSK3 was both necessary and sufficient for ADBE. These results demonstrate a presynaptic role for GSK3 and they indicate that a protein kinase signaling cascade prepares synaptic vesicles for retrieval during elevated neuronal activity."
https://openalex.org/W1996905338,"It is well established that bleeding activates the hematopoietic system to regenerate the loss of mature blood elements. We have shown that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) isolated from animals challenged with an acute bleed regulate osteoblast differentiation from marrow stromal cells. This suggests that HSCs participate in bone formation where the molecular basis for this activity is the production of BMP2 and BMP6 by HSCs. Yet, what stimulates HSCs to produce BMPs is unclear.In this study, we demonstrate that erythropoietin (Epo) activates Jak-Stat signaling pathways in HSCs which leads to the production of BMPs. Critically, Epo also directly activates mesenchymal cells to form osteoblasts in vitro, which in vivo leads to bone formation. Importantly, Epo first activates osteoclastogenesis which is later followed by osteoblastogenesis that is induced by either Epo directly or the expression of BMPs by HSCs to form bone.These data for the first time demonstrate that Epo regulates the formation of bone by both direct and indirect pathways, and further demonstrates the exquisite coupling between hematopoiesis and osteopoiesis in the marrow."

We synthesized 86 experimental studies with paired-site design, using a meta-analysis approach, to quantify the differences in ecosystem C pools between plantations and their corresponding adjacent primary and secondary forests (natural forests). Totaled ecosystem C stock in plant and soil pools was 284 Mg C ha(-1) in natural forests and decreased by 28% in plantations. In comparison with natural forests, plantations decreased aboveground net primary production, litterfall, and rate of soil respiration by 11, 34, and 32%, respectively. Fine root biomass, soil C concentration, and soil microbial C concentration decreased respectively by 66, 32, and 29% in plantations relative to natural forests. Soil available N, P and K concentrations were lower by 22, 20 and 26%, respectively, in plantations than in natural forests. The general pattern of decreased ecosystem C pools did not change between two different groups in relation to various factors: stand age (< 25 years vs. > or = 25 years), stand types (broadleaved vs. coniferous and deciduous vs. evergreen), tree species origin (native vs. exotic) of plantations, land-use history (afforestation vs. reforestation) and site preparation for plantations (unburnt vs. burnt), and study regions (tropic vs. temperate). The pattern also held true across geographic regions. Our findings argued against the replacement of natural forests by the plantations as a measure of climate change mitigation."

https://openalex.org/W2116624590,"During apoptosis, dying cells are swiftly removed by phagocytes. It is not fully understood how apoptotic cells are recognized by phagocytes. Here we report the identification and characterization of the Caenorhabditis elegans ttr-52 gene, which encodes a transthyretin-like protein and is required for efficient cell corpse engulfment. The TTR-52 protein is expressed in, and secreted from, C. elegans endoderm and clusters around apoptotic cells. Genetic analysis indicates that TTR-52 acts in the cell corpse engulfment pathway mediated by CED-1, CED-6 and CED-7 and affects clustering of the phagocyte receptor CED-1 around apoptotic cells. TTR-52 recognizes surface-exposed phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) in vivo and binds to both PtdSer and the extracellular domain of CED-1 in vitro. TTR-52 is therefore the first bridging molecule identified in C. elegans that mediates recognition of apoptotic cells by crosslinking the PtdSer 'eat me' signal with the phagocyte receptor CED-1."
https://openalex.org/W2100103275,"Tubercle bacilli are thought to persist in a dormant state during latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Although little is known about the host factors that induce and maintain Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) within latent lesions, O(2) depletion, nutrient limitation and acidification are some of the stresses implicated in bacterial dormancy development/growth arrest. Adaptation to hypoxia and exposure to NO/CO is implemented through the DevRS/DosT two-component system which induces the dormancy regulon.Here we show that vitamin C (ascorbic acid/AA) can serve as an additional signal to induce the DevR regulon. Physiological levels of AA scavenge O(2) and rapidly induce the DevR regulon at an estimated O(2) saturation of <30%. The kinetics and magnitude of the response suggests an initial involvement of DosT and a sustained DevS-mediated response during bacterial adaptation to increasing hypoxia. In addition to inducing DevR regulon mechanisms, vitamin C induces the expression of selected genes previously shown to be responsive to low pH and oxidative stress, triggers bacterial growth arrest and promotes dormancy phenotype development in M. tb grown in axenic culture and intracellularly in THP-1 cells.Vitamin C mimics multiple intracellular stresses and has wide-ranging regulatory effects on gene expression and physiology of M. tb which leads to growth arrest and a 'dormant' drug-tolerant phenotype, but in a manner independent of the DevRS/DosT system. The 'AA-dormancy infection model' offers a potential alternative to other models of non-replicating persistence of M. tb and may be useful for investigating host-'dormant' M. tb interactions. Our findings offer a new perspective on the role of nutritional factors in TB and suggest a possible role for vitamin C in TB."

Circulating cholesterol is the balance among dietary cholesterol absorption, hepatic synthesis and secretion, and the metabolism of lipoproteins by various tissues. We found that the CNS is also an important regulator of cholesterol in rodents. Inhibiting the brain's melanocortin system by pharmacological, genetic or endocrine mechanisms increased circulating HDL cholesterol by reducing its uptake by the liver independent of food intake or body weight. Our data suggest that a neural circuit in the brain is directly involved in the control of cholesterol metabolism by the liver."

We have shown previously that the A subunit in the cytoplasmic V1 sector of the V-ATPase is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA). Here we have identified by mass spectrometry and mutagenesis that Ser-175 is the major PKA phosphorylation site in the A subunit. Overexpression in HEK-293T cells of either a wild-type (WT) or phosphomimic Ser-175 to Asp (S175D) A subunit mutant caused increased acidification of HCO3−-containing culture medium compared with cells expressing vector alone or a PKA phosphorylation-deficient Ser-175 to Ala (S175A) mutant. Moreover, localization of the S175A A subunit mutant expressed in HEK-293T cells was more diffusely cytosolic than that of WT or S175D A subunit. Acute V-ATPase-mediated, bafilomycin-sensitive H+ secretion was up-regulated by a specific PKA activator in HEK-293T cells expressing WT A subunit in HCO3−-free buffer. In cells expressing the S175D mutant, V-ATPase activity at the membrane was constitutively up-regulated and unresponsive to PKA activators, whereas cells expressing the S175A mutant had decreased V-ATPase activity that was unresponsive to PKA activation. Finally, Ser-175 was necessary for PKA-stimulated apical accumulation of the V-ATPase in a polarized rabbit cell line of collecting duct A-type intercalated cell characteristics (Clone C).

https://openalex.org/W1984344010,"The four WNK (with no lysine (K)) protein kinases affect ion balance and contain an unusual protein kinase domain due to the unique placement of the active site lysine. Mutations in two WNKs cause a heritable form of ion imbalance culminating in hypertension. WNK1 activates the serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase SGK1; the mechanism is noncatalytic. SGK1 increases membrane expression of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and sodium reabsorption via phosphorylation and sequestering of the E3 ubiquitin ligase neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4-2 (Nedd4-2), which otherwise promotes ENaC endocytosis. Questions remain about the intrinsic abilities of WNK family members to regulate this pathway. We find that expression of the N termini of all four WNKs results in modest to strong activation of SGK1. In reconstitution experiments in the same cell line all four WNKs also increase sodium current blocked by the ENaC inhibitor amiloride. The N termini of the WNKs also have the capacity to interact with SGK1. More detailed analysis of activation by WNK4 suggests mechanisms in common with WNK1. Further evidence for the importance of WNK1 in this process comes from the ability of Nedd4-2 to bind to WNK1 and the finding that endogenous SGK1 has reduced activity if WNK1 is knocked down by small interfering RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2015956753,"FaO rat hepatoma cells proliferate in the absence of serum through a mechanism that requires activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. The aim of this work was to analyze the molecular mechanisms that control EGFR activation in these and other liver tumor cells. Reactive oxygen species production is observed a short time after serum withdrawal in FaO cells, coincident with up-regulation of the NADPH oxidase NOX1. NOX1-targeted knockdown, the use of antioxidants, or pharmacological inhibition of NADPH oxidase attenuates autocrine growth, coincident with lower mRNA levels of EGFR and its ligand transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) and a decrease in phosphorylation of EGFR. EGFR-targeted knockdown induces similar effects on cell growth and downstream signals to those observed in NOX1-depleted cells. Early NOX1 activation induces both a feedback-positive loop via an Src-ERK pathway that up-regulates its own levels, and a parallel signaling pathway through p38 MAPK and AKT resulting in EGFR and TGF-alpha up-regulation. Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, but not non-tumoral hepatocytes, show autocrine growth upon serum withdrawal, which is also coincident with NOX1 up-regulation that mediates EGFR and TGF-alpha expression. The use of antioxidants, or pharmacological inhibition of NADPH oxidase, effectively attenuates autocrine growth in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. In summary, results presented in this study indicate that NOX1 might control autocrine cell growth of liver tumor cells through regulation of the EGFR pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1978606767,"Neuronal differentiation is characterized by neuritogenesis and neurite outgrowth, processes that are dependent on membrane biosynthesis. Thus, the production of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), the major membrane phospholipid, should be stimulated during neuronal differentiation. We demonstrate that during retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of Neuro-2a cells, PtdCho synthesis was promoted by an ordered and sequential activation of choline kinase alpha (CK(alpha)) and choline cytidylyltransferase alpha (CCT(alpha)). Early after RA stimulation, the increase in PtdCho synthesis is mainly governed by the biochemical activation of CCT(alpha). Later, the transcription of CK(alpha)- and CCT(alpha)-encoding genes was induced. Both PtdCho biosynthesis and neuronal differentiation are dependent on ERK activation. A novel mechanism is proposed by which PtdCho biosynthesis is coordinated during neuronal differentiation. Enforced expression of either CK(alpha) or CCTalpha increased the rate of synthesis and the amount of PtdCho, and these cells initiated differentiation without RA stimulation, as evidenced by cell morphology and the expression of genes associated with neuritogenesis. The differentiation resulting from enforced expression of CCT(alpha) or CK(alpha) was dependent on persistent ERK activation. These results indicate that elevated PtdCho synthesis could mimic the RA signals and thus determine neuronal cell fate. Moreover, they could explain the key role that PtdCho plays during neuronal regeneration."

A cholinergic nucleus in the owl's midbrain exhibits functional properties that suggest its role in bottom-up stimulus selection. Neurons in the nucleus isthmi pars parvocellularis (Ipc) responded to wide ranges of visual and auditory features, but they were not tuned to particular values of those features. Instead, they encoded the relative strengths of stimuli across the entirety of space. Many neurons exhibited switch-like properties, abruptly increasing their responses to a stimulus in their receptive field when it became the strongest stimulus. This information propagates directly to the optic tectum, a structure involved in gaze control and stimulus selection, as periodic (25-50 Hz) bursts of cholinergic activity. The functional properties of Ipc neurons resembled those of a salience map, a core component in computational models for spatial attention and gaze control."
https://openalex.org/W1987190608,"The formation of primitive adipose tissue is the initial process in adipose tissue development followed by the migration of preadipocytes into adipocyte clusters. Comparatively little is known about the molecular mechanism controlling preadipocyte migration. Here, we show that cytohesin-2, the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for the Arf family GTP-binding proteins, regulates migration of mouse preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells through Arf6. SecinH3, a specific inhibitor of the cytohesin family, markedly inhibits migration of 3T3-L1 cells. 3T3-L1 cells express cytohesin-2 and cytohesin-3, and knockdown of cytohesin-2 with its small interfering RNA effectively decreases cell migration. Cytohesin-2 preferentially acts upstream of Arf6 in this signaling pathway. Furthermore, we find that the focal adhesion protein paxillin forms a complex with cytohesin-2. Paxillin colocalizes with cytohesin-2 at the leading edges of migrating cells. This interaction is mediated by the LIM2 domain of paxillin and the isolated polybasic region of cytohesin-2. Importantly, migration is inhibited by expression of the constructs containing these regions. These results suggest that cytohesin-2, through a previously unexplored complex formation with paxillin, regulates preadipocyte migration and that paxillin plays a previously unknown role as a scaffold protein of Arf guanine-nucleotide exchange factor."

CAIX has been shown to be elevated in a number of hypoxic tumor types. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficiency of intact and IgG fragments of cG250 to target CAIX in vivo in a hypoxic tumor model.Conventional biodistribution studies were performed with (111)In-DO3A-cG250, (111)In-DO3A-F(ab')(2)-cG250 and (111)In-DO3A-Fab-cG250. Additional ex vivo analysis of the tumor was performed with markers for tumor hypoxia, blood perfusion and endogenous CAIX expression. All four data sets were digitally correlated to determine the optimal agent for determining hypoxia in a HT29 colon cancer xenograft. The HT29 human colorectal tumor xenografts show strong CAIX expression in hypoxic areas of poor blood perfusion. The intact IgG had an initial high focal uptake at the periphery of these hypoxic regions and penetration into the areas of highest CAIX expression over the 7-day study period. The lower molecular weight antibody fragments had a faster uptake into areas of high CAIX expression, but had a much lower absolute uptake at the optimal imaging times.For the clinical detection of hypoxia induced CAIX using cG250 antibody based agents, imaging with the intact IgG at 7 days post injection would allow for the most sensitive and accurate detection of CAIX."

This method utilizes short hydrophilic bacterial proteins, YaiN and YbeL, fused to the ends of the membrane proteins to serve as facilitating factors for expression and purification. Fourteen prokaryotic and mammalian membrane proteins were expressed using this system. Moderate to high expression was obtained for most proteins, and detergent solubilization combined with a short purification process produced stable, monodispersed membrane proteins.

DNA Pol III was also implicated but its role in mutagenesis was unclear. We sought in vivo evidence on the presence and interactions of multiple DNA polymerases during stress-induced mutagenesis. Using multiply mutant strains, we provide evidence of competition of DNA Pols I, II and III with Pol IV, implying that they are all present at sites of stress-induced mutagenesis. Previous data indicate that Pol V is also present. We show that the interactions of Pols I, II and III with Pol IV result neither from, first, induction of the SOS response when particular DNA polymerases are removed, nor second, from proofreading of DNA Pol IV errors by the editing functions of Pol I or Pol III. Third, we provide evidence that Pol III itself does not assist with but rather inhibits Pol IV-dependent mutagenesis. The data support the remaining hypothesis that during the acts of DNA double-strand-break (DSB) repair, shown previously to underlie stress-induced mutagenesis in the Lac system, there is competition of DNA polymerases I, II and III with DNA Pol IV for action at the primer terminus. Up-regulation of Pol IV, and possibly other stress-response-controlled factor(s), tilt the competition in favor of error-prone Pol IV at the expense of more accurate polymerases, thus producing stress-induced mutations. This mutagenesis assay reveals the DNA polymerases operating in DSB repair during stress and also provides a sensitive indicator for DNA polymerase competition and choice in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2021414407,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-activated Cl− channel expressed in the apical membrane of fluid-transporting epithelia. The apical membrane density of CFTR channels is determined, in part, by endocytosis and the postendocytic sorting of CFTR for lysosomal degradation or recycling to the plasma membrane. Although previous studies suggested that ubiquitination plays a role in the postendocytic sorting of CFTR, the specific ubiquitin ligases are unknown. c-Cbl is a multifunctional molecule with ubiquitin ligase activity and a protein adaptor function. c-Cbl co-immunoprecipitated with CFTR in primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells and in cultured human airway cells. Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of c-Cbl increased CFTR expression in the plasma membrane by inhibiting CFTR endocytosis and increased CFTR-mediated Cl− currents. Silencing c-Cbl did not change the expression of the ubiquitinated fraction of plasma membrane CFTR. Moreover, the c-Cbl mutant with impaired ubiquitin ligase activity (FLAG-70Z-Cbl) did not affect the plasma membrane expression or the endocytosis of CFTR. In contrast, the c-Cbl mutant with the truncated C-terminal region (FLAG-Cbl-480), responsible for protein adaptor function, had a dominant interfering effect on the endocytosis and plasma membrane expression of CFTR. Moreover, CFTR and c-Cbl co-localized and co-immunoprecipitated in early endosomes, and silencing c-Cbl reduced the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR in early endosomes. In summary, our data demonstrate that in human airway epithelial cells, c-Cbl regulates CFTR by two mechanisms: first by acting as an adaptor protein and facilitating CFTR endocytosis by a ubiquitin-independent mechanism, and second by ubiquitinating CFTR in early endosomes and thereby facilitating the lysosomal degradation of CFTR.

CFTR-mediated Cl− secretion across polarized epithelial cells is regulated by modulating channel activity and by controlling the number of CFTR channels in the plasma membrane (6Bertrand C.A.

The apical membrane density of CFTR channels depends on the plasma membrane delivery of newly synthesized CFTR and on CFTR trafficking at the plasma membrane (i.e. endocytosis and recycling). CFTR is internalized from the plasma membrane by a clathrin-dependent mechanism into early endosomes (EEs) (i.e. endocytosis), from where it is delivered to lysosomes for degradation or is recycled to the plasma membrane. In human airway epithelial cells, CFTR endocytosis and recycling are rapid processes (i.e. minutes) and are regulated. cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator wild type CFTR Vitrogen plating medium human bronchial epithelial small interfering RNA full-length c-Cbl early endosome isobutylmethylxanthine whole cell lysate.

Ubiquitination is mediated in three steps by ubiquitin-activating (E1), conjugating (E2), and ligase (E3) enzymes, giving rise to an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin, a conserved 76-amino acid peptide, and a lysine in the target protein (10Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar). Conjugation of a single ubiquitin is known as monoubiquitination, whereas the formation of a ubiquitin chain is known as polyubiquitination (10Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar, 11Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Internalization signals as well as the lysosomal and proteosomal degradation signals are determined by the linkage, topology, and length of the ubiquitin chain on target proteins. Recent studies indicate that the ubiquitin system regulates the postendocytic sorting of CFTR. The addition of ubiquitin to the C terminus of CFTR enhances the lysosomal degradation of CFTR and reduces the plasma membrane expression of CFTR in BHK cells (12Sharma M. Pampinella F. Nemes C.

Nedd4-2, an E3 enzyme, ubiquitinates ΔF508-CFTR and inhibits its plasma membrane expression in CFPAC-1 cells (13Caohuy H. Jozwik C. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25241-25253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the pathway of ΔF508-CFTR trafficking regulated by Nedd4-2 is unknown. Deubiquitination, or removal of ubiquitin moieties from endocytosed proteins by deubiquitinating enzymes, regulates postendocytic protein trafficking by facilitating protein recycling to the plasma membrane (14Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The deubiquitinating enzyme USP10 increases the plasma membrane expression of CFTR in CFBE41o− cells by deubiquitinating CFTR in EE and thereby directing endocytosed CFTR to the recycling pathway (15Bomberger J.M. Barnaby R.L. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18778-18789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). E3 enzymes recognize and interact with specific target proteins (10Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar). The identity of E3 ligases that regulate endocytosis and the postendocytic sorting of CFTR is unknown despite the evidence that ubiquitination plays a role in these trafficking events. c-Cbl (for casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is a member of the RING (really interesting new gene) finger domain family of ubiquitin ligases (16Jiang X. Sorkin A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This multifunctional protein is also an adaptor protein by virtue of its proline-rich region and C-terminal domain (16Jiang X. Sorkin A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). c-Cbl facilitates the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of proteins that possess a tyrosine kinase domain and/or associate with cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases (17Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 18Dikic I. Szymkiewicz I. Soubeyran P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1805-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). c-Cbl interacts with proteins at the plasma membrane and facilitates their endocytosis by ubiquitinating the membrane protein and/or by facilitating the assembly of the membrane protein into a macromolecular complex that facilitates endocytosis. Once the c-Cbl-target protein complex is endocytosed, c-Cbl remains associated with the target protein in early and late endosomes, where the target protein may be subjected to multiple rounds of c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination (19Levkowitz G.

Little is known about the role of c-Cbl in airway cells, and as of this time, c-Cbl has not been reported to regulate the trafficking of ion channels. Hence, a goal of this study was to determine whether c-Cbl regulates the endocytic and postendocytic trafficking of CFTR. We report that in human airway epithelial cells, c-Cbl regulates CFTR by two mechanisms: first by acting as an adaptor protein and facilitating CFTR endocytosis by an ubiquitin-independent mechanism, and second by ubiquitinating CFTR in EE and thereby facilitating the lysosomal degradation of CFTR. CFBE41o− cells stably expressing wild type CFTR (WT-CFTR) (a generous gift from Dr. J. P. Clancy, University of Alabama at Birmingham) were seeded on Transwell (4.67 or 44 cm2) or Snapwell (1.12 cm2, 0.4-μm pore size; Corning Inc.) permeable supports coated with Vitrogen plating medium (VPM) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), human fibronectin (10 μg/ml; BD Biosciences), 1% purified collagen (PureColTM, Inamed (Fremont, CA)), and bovine serum albumin (10 μg/ml; Invitrogen) and maintained as polarized monolayers in air-liquid interface culture as described previously (22Bebok Z.

CFBE41o− cells transfected with plasmid DNA were seeded on VPM-coated plastic tissue culture plates (Corning Inc.) and cultured for 48 h. FBS and the selection antibiotic were removed from the media 24 h before experiments to augment cell polarization and cell cycle synchronization (24Chang C. Wang X. Caldwell R.B. J.

Primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells (homozygous WT-CFTR) were isolated from the proximal airways of patients undergoing lung transplant for end stage lung diseases, under a protocol approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board, or from organ donor lungs not suitable for human use (provided by the Center for Organ Recovery and Education). HBE cells (pass one) were cultured on human placental collagen-coated Transwell (4.67 cm2, 0.4-μm pore size) permeable supports at a density of ∼2 × 105 cells/cm2 in bronchial epithelial growth medium at air-liquid interface for 4–5 weeks as described previously (26Devor D.C.

Transfection of siRNA targeting the human c-cbl gene (si-c-Cbl; Hs_CBL_7_HP validated siRNA, Qiagen (Valencia, CA)) or siRNA control (si-Neg, Qiagen) into CFBE41o− cells was conducted using HiPerFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A second siRNA, targeting another non-conserved region of the human c-cbl gene purchased from Qiagen (Hs_CBL_8_HP validated siRNA) also silenced the expression of c-Cbl with similar efficiency. The Hs_CBL_7_HP validated siRNA was used in subsequent experiments. Two transfection protocols were used. In initial experiments, CFBE41o− cells (0.1 × 106) were plated on VPM-coated Transwell permeable supports, and 3 days after seeding cells were incubated with the optimized transfection mixture containing a 15 nm concentration of either si-c-Cbl or si-Neg at 37 °C. Transfection medium was removed after 24 h and was replaced with normal growth medium. Cells were cultured for an additional 72 h to form polarized monolayers (total 7 days in culture). si-c-Cbl reduced c-Cbl protein expression by 54.5 ± 4.3% of si-Neg (p < 0.05) as assessed by Western blotting (n = 4 in each group; data not shown). In subsequent experiments, CFBE41o− cells (1.0 × 106) were plated on tissue culture plates and incubated with the optimized transfection mixture containing a 50 nm concentration of either si-c-Cbl or si-Neg at 37 °C. After 24 h, cells were trypsinized and plated on VPM coated Transwell or Snapwell permeable supports and cultured for an additional 6 days to establish polarized monolayers (total 7 days in culture). si-c-Cbl decreased c-Cbl protein expression by 79.3 ± 2.4% of si-Neg (p < 0.05) as assessed by Western blotting (n = 6 in each group), and the second protocol replaced the first one because of improved c-Cbl silencing efficiency. si-c-Cbl did not affect the protein expression of the homologue, Cbl-b, that shares many substrates with c-Cbl (17Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In addition, si-c-Cbl did not affect the protein expression of the endocytic adaptors clathrin, the μ2 subunit of adaptor protein complex-2 (AP-2), and Rab5 in either silencing protocol. The cDNAs encoding human full-length c-Cbl (c-Cbl FL), the c-Cbl fragment with impaired ubiquitin ligase activity lacking 17 residues between amino acids 366 and 382 at the beginning of the RING finger domain (70Z-Cbl), and the truncated c-Cbl fragment expressing amino acid residues 1–480 containing the intact RING finger domain but lacking the proline-rich region and the distal C terminus (Cbl-480) were described previously (28Galisteo M.L.

In addition, the c-Cbl FL was also expressed in pCMV6 vector with the C-terminal FLAG. Upon receipt, constructs were sequence-verified by ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA)). Transfection of cells with plasmids was performed using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected CFBE41o− cells were seeded on VPM-coated tissue-coated plates and harvested 48 h later (30Swiatecka-Urban A. Boyd C. Coutermarsh B. Karlson K.H. Barnaby R. Aschenbrenner L. Langford G.M.

Goat anti-mouse IgG1 coupled to Alexa 647, goat anti-mouse IgG2b coupled to Alexa 546, and goat anti-rabbit coupled to Alexa 488 were purchased from Invitrogen. All antibodies were used at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturer or as indicated in the figure legends. The biochemical determination of plasma membrane CFTR was performed by domain-selective plasma membrane biotinylation in cells grown on permeable growth supports or by cell surface biotinylation in cells grown in tissue culture dishes using EZ-LinkTM sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce), followed by cell lysis in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1% Triton, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), as described previously in detail (31Moyer B.D.

Quantification of biotinylated CFTR was performed by densitometry using exposures within the linear dynamic range of the film. Endocytic assays were performed in CFBE41o− cells, as described previously (33Watts C. Davidson H.W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1937-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34Swiatecka-Urban A.

Briefly, the plasma membrane proteins were first biotinylated at 4 °C using EZ-LinkTM sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Pierce). Cells were rapidly warmed to 37 °C for 2.5, 5, 7.5, or 10 min after biotinylation, and subsequently, the disulfide bonds on Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotinylated proteins remaining in the plasma membrane were reduced by GSH (Sigma) at 4 °C. At this point in the protocol, biotinylated proteins reside within the endosomal compartment. Subsequently, cells were lysed, and biotinylated proteins were isolated by streptavidin-agarose beads, eluted into SDS-sample buffer, and separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The amount of biotinylated CFTR at 4 °C and without the 37 °C warming was considered 100%. The amount of biotinylated CFTR remaining in the plasma membrane after GSH treatment at 4 °C and without the 37 °C warming was considered background (5.6 ± 1.1% compared with the amount of biotinylated CFTR at 4 °C without GSH treatment) and was subtracted from the CFTR biotinylated after warming to 37 °C at each time point. CFTR endocytosis was calculated after subtraction of the background and was expressed as the percentage of biotinylated CFTR at each time point after warming to 37 °C compared with the amount of biotinylated CFTR present before warming to 37 °C. CFTR and c-Cbl were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates or from EE fractions by methods described previously (23Swiatecka-Urban A. Brown A. Moreau-Marquis S. Renuka J. Coutermarsh B. Barnaby R.

Briefly, cultured cells were lysed in an immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% IGEPAL (Sigma), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 30 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) to inhibit deubiquitinating enzymes and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences). After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min to pellet insoluble material, the soluble lysates were precleared by incubation with protein G or protein A, as appropriate, conjugated to Sepharose beads (Pierce) at 4 °C. The precleared lysates were added to the protein G- or protein A-Sepharose bead antibody complexes. CFTR was immunoprecipitated by incubation with the mouse M3A7 antibody, and c-Cbl was immunoprecipitated by incubation with the rabbit C-15 antibody. Non-immune mouse or rabbit IgGs (DAKO North America, Inc. (Carpinteria, CA)) were used as controls. After washing the protein G- or protein A-Sepharose bead antibody complexes with the IP buffer, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by incubation at 85 °C for 5 min in sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 80 mm dithiothreitol. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5 or 15% gels (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by Western blotting. The immunoreactive bands were visualized with the Western LightningTM Plus-ECL detection system. For immunoprecipitation of the plasma membrane CFTR, apical membrane proteins were first isolated using domain-selective cell surface biotinylation, as described above. Biotin-labeled plasma membrane proteins were eluted from streptavidin beads by incubation with the elution buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol) for 5 min at room temperature and for another 5 min at 85 °C. Eluates were diluted with 10 volumes of dilution buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet to neutralize dithiothreitol). Diluted eluates were then combined with antibody M3A7-protein G-Sepharose complex beads at 4 °C for 2 h to immunoprecipitate biotinylated (i.e. apical plasma membrane) CFTR. IP samples and cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting as described above. To isolate the EE fraction, subcellular fractionation was performed using a 5–20% (w/v) continuous OptiPrepTM (Sigma) gradient formed by overlaying a 5% gradient on top of a 20% gradient at room temperature for 4 h. OptiPrepTM and buffer solutions were prepared as described previously (35Sheff D.R. Daro E.A. Hull M. Mellman I. J.

For ubiquitination studies, CFBE41o− cells were pretreated with 200 μm chloroquine (Sigma) in serum-free culture medium for 5 h at 37 °C to inhibit lysosomal degradation of ubiquitinated CFTR. Cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline three times and scraped into 0.7 ml of homogenization buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 78 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 8.4 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (pH 7.0) and the Complete protease inhibitor mixture and passed through a 22-gauge syringe at a 1-ml maximum volume 30 times. A postnuclear supernatant was generated by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The postnuclear supernatant was placed on the 5–20% continuous OptiPrepTM gradient and centrifuged in a TH-660 rotor (6 × 4.4 ml) in a Sorvall Discovery 90SE Ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. Fractions were collected and kept at 4 °C for no more than 8 h while an aliquot of each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis to localize the EE markers, EEA1 and Rab5. LAMP-1 and Na,K-ATPase, not localized to early endosomes, were used as negative controls. The EE fractions were then pooled and subjected to immunoprecipitation assays as described above. Ussing chamber measurements were performed as previously described (36Swiatecka-Urban A. Moreau-Marquis S. Maceachran D.P. Connolly J.P. Stanton C.R. Su J.R. Barnaby R. O'toole G.A. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 290: C862-C872Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Monolayers of airway cells grown on Snapwell permeable supports were mounted in an Ussing-type chamber (Physiologic Instruments (San Diego, CA)) and bathed in solutions (see below) maintained at 37 °C and stirred by bubbling with 5% CO2, 95% air. Short circuit current (Isc) was measured by voltage-clamping the transepithelial voltage across the monolayers to 0 mV with a voltage/current clamp (model VCC MC8, Physiologic Instruments) as described previously (36Swiatecka-Urban A. Moreau-Marquis S. Maceachran D.P. Connolly J.P. Stanton C.R. Su J.R. Barnaby R. O'toole G.A. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 290: C862-C872Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Data collection and analysis were done with the Acquire & Analyze Data Acquisition System (Physiologic Instruments). CFBE41o− cells were bathed in solutions with an apical-to-basolateral Cl− gradient in the presence of amiloride (100 μm) in the apical bath solution to inhibit Na+ absorption. The apical bath solution contained 115 mm sodium gluconate, 5 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 3.3 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mm K2HPO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 4 mm calcium gluconate, 10 mm mannitol (pH 7.4). The basolateral bath solution contained 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 3.3 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mm K2HPO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 10.0 mm glucose (pH 7.4). A low Cl−, high-Na+, high gluconate, apical bath solution was used to prevent cell swelling due to the increased apical Cl− permeability under these conditions, as described previously (36Swiatecka-Urban A. Moreau-Marquis S. Maceachran D.P. Connolly J.P. Stanton C.R. Su J.R. Barnaby R. O'toole G.A. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol.

Thiazolidinone CFTRinh-172 (20 μm; Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO)) was added to the apical bath solution to inhibit CFTR-mediated Isc. Data are expressed as forskolin/IBMX-stimulated Isc, calculated by subtracting the base-line Isc from the peak stimulated Isc. I"
https://openalex.org/W2061747311,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of respiratory acute infections around the world. In Latin America, approximately 20,000 children under 5 years of age die of pneumococcal diseases annually. Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) is among the best-characterized pneumococcal antigens that confer protection in animal models of pneumococcal infections and, as such, is a good alternative for the currently available conjugated vaccines. Efficient immune responses directed to PspA in animal models have already been described. Nevertheless, few low cost adjuvants for a subunit pneumococcal vaccine have been proposed to date. Here, we have tested the adjuvant properties of the whole cell Bordetella pertussis vaccine (wP) that is currently part of the DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) vaccine administrated to children in several countries, as an adjuvant to PspA. Nasal immunization of BALB/c mice with a combination of PspA5 and wP or wPlow – a new generation vaccine that contains low levels of B. pertussis LPS – conferred protection against a respiratory lethal challenge with S. pneumoniae. Both PspA5-wP and PspA5-wPlow vaccines induced high levels of systemic and mucosal antibodies against PspA5, with similar profile, indicating no essential requirement for B. pertussis LPS in the adjuvant properties of wP. Accordingly, nasal immunization of C3H/HeJ mice with PspA5-wP conferred protection against the pneumococcal challenge, thus ruling out a role for TLR4 responses in the adjuvant activity and the protection mechanisms triggered by the vaccines. The high levels of anti-PspA5 antibodies correlated with increased cross-reactivity against PspAs from different clades and also reflected in cross-protection. In addition, passive immunization experiments indicated that antibodies played an important role in protection in this model. Finally, subcutaneous immunization with a combination of PspA5 with DTPlow protected mice against challenge with two different pneumococcal strains, opening the possibility for the development of a combined infant vaccine composed of DTP and PspA."

https://openalex.org/W1970425345,"Cbl proteins are ubiquitin ligases (E3s) that play a significant role in regulating tyrosine kinase signaling. There are three mammalian family members: Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c. All have a highly conserved N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain, a catalytic RING finger domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain that mediates interactions with Src homology 3 (SH3) containing proteins. Although both Cbl and Cbl-b have been studied widely, little is known about Cbl-c. Published reports have demonstrated that the N terminus of Cbl and Cbl-b have an inhibitory effect on their respective E3 activity. However, the mechanism for this inhibition is still unknown. In this study we demonstrate that the N terminus of Cbl-c, like that of Cbl and Cbl-b, inhibits the E3 activity of Cbl-c. Furthermore, we map the region responsible for the inhibition to the EF-hand and SH2 domains. Phosphorylation of a critical tyrosine (Tyr-341) in the linker region of Cbl-c by Src or a phosphomimetic mutation of this tyrosine (Y341E) is sufficient to increase the E3 activity of Cbl-c. We also demonstrate for the first time that phosphorylation of Tyr-341 or the Y341E mutation leads to a decrease in affinity for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), UbcH5b. The decreased affinity of the Y341E mutant Cbl-c for UbcH5b results in a more rapid turnover of bound UbcH5b coincident with the increased E3 activity. These data suggest that the N terminus of Cbl-c contributes to the binding to the E2 and that phosphorylation of Tyr-341 leads to a decrease in affinity and an increase in the E3 activity of Cbl-c."
https://openalex.org/W2085559564,"Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (gp120/gp41) plays a critical role in virus infection and pathogenesis. Three of the six monoclonal antibodies considered to have broadly neutralizing activities (2F5, 4E10, and Z13e1) bind to the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of gp41. This makes the MPER a desirable template for developing immunogens that can elicit antibodies with properties similar to these monoclonal antibodies, with a long term goal of developing antigens that could serve as novel HIV vaccines. In order to provide a structural basis for rational antigen design, an MPER construct, HR1-54Q, was generated for x-ray crystallographic and x-ray footprinting studies to provide both high resolution atomic coordinates and verification of the solution state of the antigen, respectively. The crystal structure of HR1-54Q reveals a trimeric, coiled-coil six-helical bundle, which probably represents a postfusion form of gp41. The MPER portion extends from HR2 in continuation of a slightly bent long helix and is relatively flexible. The structures observed for the 2F5 and 4E10 epitopes agree well with existing structural data, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays indicate that the antigen binds well to antibodies that recognize the above epitopes. Hydroxyl radical-mediated protein footprinting of the antigen in solution reveals specifically protected and accessible regions consistent with the predictions based on the trimeric structure from the crystallographic data. Overall, the HR1-54Q antigen, as characterized by crystallography and footprinting, represents a postfusion, trimeric form of HIV gp41, and its structure provides a rational basis for gp41 antigen design suitable for HIV vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2058294499,"Background Co-infection with HIV-1 and HCV is a significant global public health problem and a major consideration for anti-HIV-1 treatment. HCV infection among HIV-1 positive people who are eligible for the newly launched nationwide anti-HIV-1 treatment program in China has not been well characterized. Methodology A nationwide survey of HIV-1 positive injection drug uses (IDU), former paid blood donors (FBD), and sexually transmitted cases from multiple provinces including the four most affected provinces in China was conducted. HCV prevalence and genetic diversity were determined. We found that IDU and FBD have extremely high rates of HCV infection (97% and 93%, respectively). Surprisingly, people who acquired HIV-1 through sexual contact also had a higher rate of HCV infection (20%) than the general population. HIV-1 subtype and HCV genotypes were amazingly similar among FBD from multiple provinces stretching from Central to Northeast China. However, although patterns of overland trafficking of heroin and distinct HIV-1 subtypes could be detected among IDU, HCV genotypes of IDU were more diverse and exhibited significant regional differences. Conclusion Emerging HIV-1 and HCV co-infection and possible sexual transmission of HCV in China require urgent prevention measures and should be taken into consideration in the nationwide antiretroviral treatment program."
https://openalex.org/W1989073024,"Many double-stranded DNA viruses employ ATP-driven motors to translocate their genomes into small, preformed viral capsids against large forces resisting confinement. Here, we show via direct single-molecule measurements that a mutation T194M downstream of the Walker B motif in the phage λ gpA packaging motor causes an 8-fold reduction in translocation velocity without substantially changing processivity or force dependence, whereas the mutation G212S in the putative C (coupling) motif causes a 3-fold reduction in velocity and a 6-fold reduction in processivity. Meanwhile a T194M pseudorevertant (T194V) showed a near restoration of the wild-type dynamics. Structural comparisons and modeling show that these mutations are in a loop-helix-loop region that positions the key residues of the catalytic motifs, Walker B and C, in the ATPase center and is structurally homologous with analogous regions in chromosome transporters and SF2 RNA helicases. Together with recently published studies of SpoIIIE chromosome transporter and Ded1 RNA helicase mutants, these findings suggest the presence of a structurally conserved region that may be a part of the mechanism that determines motor velocity and processivity in several different types of nucleic acid translocases.

Viral DNA packaging motors are remarkable biological nanomachines that are capable of packaging chromosomes to near-crystalline density into viral capsids against enormous internal forces (1Smith D.E. Tans S.J. Smith S.B. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Bustamante C. Nature. 2001; 413: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 2Catalano C. Viral Genome Packaging Machines: Genetics, Structure, and Mechanism. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005Google Scholar). Such motors are present in many double-stranded DNA bacteriophages (3Campbell A.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 5th Ed. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2007: 769-794Google Scholar), the medically relevant herpesviruses (4Roizman B. Knipe D.M. Whitley R.J. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 5th Ed. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2007: 2501-2602Google Scholar), and possibly in poxviruses and adenoviruses (5Berk A.J. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 5th Ed. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2007: 2355-2394Google Scholar). The well characterized genetics and biochemistry of the bacteriophage λ system make it an ideal model system for investigating the structure-function relationships of DNA-packaging machines (6Feiss M. Catalano C. Catalano C. Viral Genome Packaging Machines: Genetics, Structure, and Mechanism. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005: 5-33Google Scholar, 7Rao V.B. Feiss M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 647-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The “terminase enzyme” is the major active component of the λ packaging motor responsible for DNA translocation. It is composed of multiple heterotrimer units, each containing a large gpA subunit and two small gpNu1 subunits (8Maluf N.K. Yang Q. Catalano C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 523-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This ATP-powered complex mediates a number of different activities needed to package unit length genomes from concatemeric substrates; these include endonuclease, strand separation, ATP hydrolysis, and DNA translocation catalytic activities. The terminase enzyme initiates packaging by binding to a cos site in a linear DNA concatemer composed of several viral genomes. Terminase introduces staggered nicks at the downstream cosN site, 12-bp apart to form the left mature genome end. The motor then binds to a procapsid and translocates DNA into the capsid interior. Packaging is terminated when the terminase encounters the next downstream cos site, which signals the right end of the genome; terminase again nicks the duplex, releasing the DNA-filled capsid. Recent evidence indicates that gpA1(gpNu1)2 heterotrimers assemble into a tetrameric ring, which we presume is representative of the DNA maturation and packaging motor complex (9Maluf N.K. Gaussier H. Bogner E. Feiss M. Catalano C.E. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15259-15268Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our earlier studies of the ATPase center of the λ packaging motor included mutational analysis and ATP binding studies, which indicated that residues Tyr46 and Lys84 of gpA were involved in ATP binding associated with packaging (10Dhar A. Feiss M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 738Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 11Hang J.Q. Tack B.F. Feiss M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 777-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A collection of mutations causing motor defects was mapped to the gene segment encoding the amino terminus of gpA (12Duffy C. Feiss M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 547-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mutants L180F and G212S could package DNA but never packaged >31 kbp of DNA of the 48.5-kbp genome; we referred to this as a stalled translocation phenotype. Other mutants such as G191S abolished packaging completely, suggesting that these residues are located in important sites for translocation. Among the most interesting mutants isolated was T194M, for which bulk DNase protection assays showed that the full λ genome could be packaged in vivo, but only if the incubation time was extended from 1 to 2.5 h. However, it is unclear from these assays whether the reduced packaging activity of T194M is due to (i) slowed assembly of the motor-DNA and/or motor-DNA-procapsid complexes, (ii) slowed initiation of packaging, (iii) slowed DNA translocation rate, or (iv) increased motor pausing, stalling, or slipping (decreased processivity). Here, we investigate the effects of mutations on packaging dynamics using a single-molecule optical tweezers assay that measures directly DNA translocation by individual motor complexes in real-time with 0.1-s precision. This technique revealed that the WT 6The abbreviations used are: WTwild-typegpgene productpNpiconewtonsAUCanalytical ultra centrifugation. λ motor-DNA complex can bind the prohead and initiate packaging within seconds, that the average DNA translocation velocity is ∼600 bp/s at the beginning of packaging and slows as packaging proceeds, and that the full-length genome could be packaged in ∼2 min. We further used sequence alignments and packaging measurements of the mutant Y46F to show that gpA contains a “Q motif” that regulates motor-DNA interactions and governs motor force and power generation (13Tsay J.M.

Optical tweezer assays also were applied previously to measuring DNA packaging dynamics of the ϕ29 and T4 phage (1Smith D.E. Tans S.J. Smith S.B. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Bustamante C.

In all cases, most strikingly in the T4 system, these measurements of revealed variability in the packaging dynamics of individual complexes, suggesting that the motor may have different conformational states producing different translocation velocities (17Fuller D.N.

The average DNA translocation rate correlated with the genome sizes of the various phages (1Smith D.E. Tans S.J. Smith S.B. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Bustamante C.

Biol. 2007; 373: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Many molecular motor NTPases have common functional motifs including Walker A motifs, with the consensus sequence GXXXXGK(T/S), that are implicated in binding ATP and Walker B motifs with conserved adjacent Asp and catalytic Glu (DE) residues, which are implicated in arranging Mg2+ and water molecules to hydrolyze ATP (19Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 8: 945-951Crossref Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). Regions downstream from the putative Walker B motif of gpA have not been investigated previously by single molecule measurements and may thus have undetermined functions that relate to the velocity of the motor. For example, the Thr194 residue of gpA is located in a functionally unassigned region between the Walker B motif and the “C motif”. Sequence alignments suggest that a putative C motif of λ terminase is located 30 residues distal to the Walker B (20Draper B. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Mitchell M.S. Matsuzaki S. Imai S. Rao V.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4009-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recent work in a related system, phage T4, has found that mutations of the C motif of the DNA packaging motor result in single turnover hydrolysis with no translocation, suggesting that C motifs of viral packaging motors act as ATP hydrolysis sensors, which couple hydrolysis to translocation of DNA (20Draper B. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Evidence from crystal structures and bulk chemical assays also strongly suggest the analogous motif III in RNA helicases has important roles in substrate interaction and ATP hydrolysis (22Banroques J. Doère M. Dreyfus M. Linder P. Tanner N.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 396: 949-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Story R.M. Li H. Abelson J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3624Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study, we use single molecule optical tweezers measurements to directly investigate the effect of mutations altering this region of gpA on real-time DNA translocation dynamics. We find that T194M mutants translocate 8–10× slower than WT terminases with no change in processivity, unique for this class of motors. In addition, we find that the mutant G212S has a 3× decreased translocation rate compared with WT but also a large decrease in processivity. We also use genetic screening experiments to identify pseudorevertants of these null mutants that restore the viability of the phages. Structural modeling based on sequence homology and the known structure of phage T4 gp17 indicate that these residues lie in a loop-helix-loop region between the Walker B motif and putative C motif that can position these catalytic motifs in the ATPase center. Comparisons with chromosome transporters and DEAD-box RNA helicases suggest this is a structurally conserved region that may determine velocity and processivity in several different types of nucleic acid translocases. A 34.7-kbp λ biotinylated DNA construct was made as described previously (18Fuller D.N. Raymer D.M. Rickgauer J.P. Robertson R.M. Catalano C.E. Anderson D.L. Grimes S. Smith D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The biotinylated DNA (2 μl DNA (30–40 μg/ml) was incubated with streptavidin-coated microspheres (2.1 μm) for 30 min to create DNA-coated microspheres in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, 10 mm magnesium, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol at pH 8.0. Purified complexes of gpNu1 and gpA and crude extracts yielded nearly identical packaging results for mutant- and WT-packaging events (13Tsay J.M. Sippy J. Feiss M. Smith D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 2–2.5 μl of crude cellular extracts containing gpNu1, gpA, and integration host factor were added to the DNA-coated microspheres. Alternatively, in an assay using purified proteins, integration host factor (33 nm final) and 4 μm terminase (267 nm final) were incubated with DNA-coated microspheres for 20 min to 1 h. This reaction afforded the maturation of λ and the binding of terminase to DNA. Protein G microspheres (2.1 nm) were incubated with IgG λ antibodies to create IgG λ microspheres. To make procapsid-bound microspheres, procapsids were incubated with IgG λ microspheres for 30 min. Two microspheres are held in two laser traps, one of which was moved relative to the other using an acousto-optic deflector. Viral packaging of DNA could be initiated by bringing prohead microspheres in contact with DNA/terminase-coated microspheres. The viral DNA packaging assay using optical tweezers was applied to the λ virus using purified terminase and proheads. This induced the assembly of the terminase complex on λ DNA and the maturation of this DNA through its endonuclease and helicase activities. In the λ packaging assay, terminase/DNA-bound beads were brought into contact of prohead-bound microspheres and pulled apart until they reached 5 pN for at least 70 s unless there was instant initiation. Packaging was initiated under saturating ATP conditions (1 mm) in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl and 10 mm magnesium at a pH of 7.5. All measurements of DNA packaging were taken using a dual beam trap optical tweezers instrument described previously, under a constant force feedback of ∼5 pN or using a passive mode enabling the measurement of force generation as packaging progressed (24Rickgauer J.R. Fuller D.N. GrimeS S. Jardine P.J. Anderson D.L. Smith D.E. Biophys. J. 2007; (48a–48a)PubMed Google Scholar). Large slips (>100 bp) and long pauses (>0.2 s) were marked and compiled using custom-made software in Matlab. The tpauses and tslips used in efficiency calculations (Equation 1) were the durations of pausing that end upon resuming of packaging (tpauses) and durations for which the motor slips, resumes packaging, and reaches its previous maximum length translocated before slipping occurs (tslips). Mutations in the A gene, which code for the T194M, T194M/F156Y, T194V, and G212S changes, were introduced into the terminase expression vector pQH101 (25Hang Q. Woods L. Feiss M. Catalano C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15305-15314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Terminase genes were sequenced to verify that only the desired mutation was present. During sequence analysis, the F156Y change, which resulted from a PCR-introduced mutation, was found in a pQH101 isolate during construction of the T194M expression vector. Plaque-forming pseudorevertants were isolated by plating 100 λl of lysates of λ-P1 5R:Knr cI857 nin5 (where Knr represents kanamycin-resistant) (26Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J.

Lysogens of pseudorevertants served as template for PCR-generated DNA, which was used to sequence the terminase genes. Sequencing assured that the only changes present were the original and second site mutations. To avoid isolation of sibling revertants, 13 independent lysates were examined for the T194M mutant, and 30 for the G212S mutant. All procedures were done using standard phage methods (28Arber W. Enquist L. Hohn B. Murray N.E. Murray K. Hendrix R.W. Roberts J.W. Stahl F.W. Weisberg R.A. Lambda II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 366-433Google Scholar).

Terminase concentration was adjusted between mutants to observe steady-state ATPase activity. Reactions had WT, G212S, and T194M concentrations of 25 nm, 674 nm, and 2.26 μm, respectively. Analysis was performed in the linear range of the reaction. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Dialyzed protein samples were loaded into Epon charcoal-filled two sector centerpieces, and dialysate was used as a blank. AUC cells were loaded into the precooled rotor and chamber at 7 °C of a Beckman XL-A centrifuge. Experiments were performed at 42,000 rpm, and absorbance was observed at 280 nm at 0.005 cm in continuous scan mode. Determination of a continuous c(s) distribution was performed using SEDFIT. Calculations for buffer density (ρ = 1.03), buffer viscosity (μ = 0.017), and terminase-specific volume (ṽ = 0.7245) were performed with SEDNTERP (30Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R.

Our first measurements employed force clamp feedback control to change the separation between two optical traps as the DNA was translocated into the phage λ capsids under a small constant load (∼5 pN). This enabled us to track double-stranded DNA viral packaging for long distances. The translocation dynamics of several mutant terminases with changes T194M, T194M/F156Y, T194V, and G212S were characterized. Sequence alignments show that these residues are located between the Walker B and ATPase-coupling motifs (C motif) of the large terminase proteins (Fig. 1) (20Draper B. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Representative packaging events of the mutant terminases are shown in Fig. 2. Notable in each packaging event is the presence of pauses and slips where the motors temporarily stop or temporarily lose grip before resuming packaging. We define the average velocity of translocation (Vmax) as the rate of translocation at saturating ATP conditions (1 mm), excluding the contributions of these slips and pauses (see “Experimental Procedures”).FIGURE 2Representative raw data of packaging events of various terminases using an optical tweezers assay. A schematic depicting the assay is shown in the upper right panel. Beads were held in two optical traps: one bead holds the viral procapsid, and the other holds the DNA/terminase complex. Packaging traces for all mutants shown end with a stall. Packaging was initiated when the beads are brought closer together and the DNA/terminase complex binds to the procapsids. A 5-pN force clamp was utilized to track packaging for long distances.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The T194M single mutant exhibited a Vmax of 82.0 ± 20.7 bp/s, ∼8× slower than WT (Fig. 3). The T194M/F156Y double mutant had similar behavior in translocation dynamics to T194M but with a smaller Vmax of 56.9 ± 8.9 bp/s, a velocity >10× slower than WT. Interestingly, the double mutant also exhibited less variability from complex to complex in translocation velocity than both T194M (S.D. for Vmax of 15% compared with 21% for WT and 25% for T194M). To assess the effects of slipping and pausing on the time it takes for terminase to package DNA, we calculated an efficiency factor as described previously (13Tsay J.M. Sippy J. Feiss M. Smith D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).E=tactive packaging /ttotal =(ttotal −tslips −tpauses )/ttotal (Eq. 1) This factor quantifies how much packaging is slowed due to pausing and slipping and gives a value for how continuous packaging is in the various terminases. The efficiency factors measured for T194M and T194M/F156Y are near WT (Fig. 3b), which implies that the translocase activity is highly processive. However, these mutants do exhibit increased motor stalling relative to WT, which is not factored in the efficiency factor defined above. Stalls are events where the motor begins translocating but then stops and does not resume again on the time scale of full genome packaging (in <3 min). Stalls in packaging before packaging <50% of the whole genome packaged (instead of the complete dissociation of tethers under a 5-pN load) were found in all packaging measurements of T194M and T194M/F156Y (supplemental Fig. S1). This suggests that stalling is not due to disassembly. Because it was found in bulk biochemical studies that some T194M complexes could eventually package the full-length chromosome after 2.5 h, these mutants may eventually appear to be able to recover from stalling events and complete packaging, or more likely, there only is a very small fraction of these that are able to complete packaging (<4%). Presumably, these are not observed readily in the single molecule experiments due to their low abundance. We note that we expect the in vivo packaging situation to possibly be different from our in vitro packaging measurements because in vivo, the disassembled motor could reassemble or exchange with the terminase subunits. On the other hand, the stalling defects found here along with the 8× slower Vmax and normal pausing and slipping behavior (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S4) compared with WT reconcile the 1.2% measured DNA packaging efficiency found in bulk studies. We also carried out experiments where we held the trap positions fixed after initiating packaging to probe the force-generating capability of the mutant complexes. We found a similar relationship of load force versus velocity of translocation (F-V) relationship for T194M when compared with WT (supplemental Fig. S2). This can be contrasted with a much steeper F-V curve measured for the previously studied Q motif mutant, Y46F (13Tsay J.M. Sippy J. Feiss M. Smith D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The functional effects, in terms of velocity, pausing, slipping, force, and power, is distinct from those caused by the K84A and Y46F changes. The translocation rate of G212S was measured to be ∼3× slower than WT (195 bp/s) with a variability among individual complexes greater than T194M and WT motors (S.D. ∼ 30%). The processivity of this motor also is lower than WT; the slipping frequency of G212S (number of slips per kbp of DNA packaged, number per length = 0.135) is >6× more than WT (0.020) suggesting there are structural defects induced by the mutation (Fig. 3). Despite the decreased processivity, the efficiency of the motor is still 80% of the WT. Similar to T194M and in agreement with bulk biochemical data, G212S displays a stalling phenotype, where no translocation events were measured to exceed 50% of the genome length. The M194V change was found in plaque-forming pseudorevertants of λ T194M (T194M phages that have additional mutations that partially or fully restore the WT phenotype), and a number of other pseudorevertants have an S230P change, suggesting that the T194V, and T194M/S230P motors must function with near-WT efficiency to sponsor fully infectious virus assembly in vivo. Using single molecule DNA packaging measurements, we found that T194V has a velocity close to WT (420 ± 143 bp/s), implicating the change to Val restored the viability of the virus via the restoration of translocation velocity. The efficiency factor of this motor is similar to WT (0.83 ± 0.05) as expected. (The T194M motor does not show a decrease in efficiency as well.) Stalling statistics of the T194V motor also showed a greater number of events that could reach >50% full genome packaging (supplemental Fig. S1), though the early stalling behavior is still more prevalent than with WT, which would explain why smaller plaque sizes were observed for T194V than WT. A number of second site pseudorevertants for G212S have been isolated and are found in various locations within gpA (Table 1). These have not yet been characterized in detail.TABLE 1Suppressors for lethal mutations of gpA and the locations of the amino acid changesMutantPhenotypeModeled residue interactionSuppressorsL180SStallArg211–Pro215 (C motif)A181SG191SNo packagingNeighboring residuesNone foundT194MStall, slow (8×)Phe183M194V, S230PG212SStall, slow (3×), less processive (6×)Val74, Ser213M61L, E71D, N73S (between Q and Walker A); D185G, S192A (in loop-helix-loop region); and H232Y, H232R, C295S, K297Q, K297N, T323N (near hinge) Open table in a new tab The ATPase activity of the purified terminase holoenzymes also was examined. Terminase possesses three discrete ATPase catalytic activities that are involved putatively in (i) assembly of the motor at cos (gpNu1 ATPase), (ii) modulation of the endonuclease/strand-separation activities of the enzyme, and (iii) fueling motor translocation (packaging ATPase) (6Feiss M.

Biol. 2007; 373: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The packaging ATPase activity can be monitored selectively by using low concentrations of ATP (50 μm) in the reaction mixture because the Km for the packaging ATPase is significantly lower than the other two sites (5 μm versus 500 μm) (29Tomka M.A. Catalano C.E.

As can be seen in Fig. 4, the packaging ATPase activities of the G212S and T194M mutant holoenzymes are reduced substantially relative to the WT enzyme (2.5% and 0.8% relative activity, respectively; Table 2). The packaging ATPase activity, which is lower than expected when comparing the less severe reduction in translocation velocity (mutants are 3–10× slower than WT), may be reconciled when taking into account initiation defects (not measured) and the stalling defects previously mentioned (supplemental Fig. S1), which likely terminate hydrolysis before mutants are able to package the full chromosome.TABLE 2Packaging velocities measured by optical tweezer assays and catalytic activities of wild-type and mutant terminase enzymesEnzymePackaging VmaxATPase activityWild-type580 ± 120 bp/s81 ± 8 min−1G212S195 ± 66 bp/s2.0 ± 0.2 min−1T194M82.0 ± 20.7 bp/s0.6 ± 0.2 min−1T194M/F156Y56.9 ± 8.9 bp/sNET194V420 ± 143 bp/sNE Open table in a new tab We have demonstrated previously that the purified WT terminase holoenzyme partitions into two discrete species, a homogenous protomer composed of one gpA tightly associated with two gpNu1 polypeptides and a heterogenous oligomer predominantly composed of four protomers (the terminase ring species) (8Maluf N.K.

https://openalex.org/W1997616785,"Background Ca2+-mediated regulation of ion channels provides a link between intracellular signaling pathways and membrane electrical activity. Intracellular Ca2+ inhibits the voltage-gated potassium channel EAG1 through the direct binding of calmodulin (CaM). Three CaM binding sites (BD-C1: 674-683, BD-C2: 711-721, BD-N: 151-165) have been identified in a peptide screen and were proposed to mediate binding. The participation of the three sites in CaM binding to the native channel, however, remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we studied the binding of Ca2+/CaM to the EAG channel by visualizing the interaction between YFP-labeled CaM and Cerulean-labeled hEAG1 in mammalian cells by FRET. The results of our cellular approach substantiate that two CaM binding sites are predominantly involved; the high-affinity 1-8-14 based CaM binding domain in the N-terminus and the second C-terminal binding domain BD-C2. Mutations at these sites completely abolished CaM binding to hEAG1. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrated that the BD-N and BD-C2 binding domains are sufficient for CaM binding to the native channel, and, therefore, that BD-C1 is unable to bind CaM independently."
https://openalex.org/W2086767316,"YopD-like translocator proteins encoded by several Gram-negative bacteria are important for type III secretion-dependent delivery of anti-host effectors into eukaryotic cells. This probably depends on their ability to form pores in the infected cell plasma membrane, through which effectors may gain access to the cell interior. In addition, Yersinia YopD is a negative regulator essential for the control of effector synthesis and secretion. As a prerequisite for this functional duality, YopD may need to establish molecular interactions with other key T3S components. A putative coiled-coil domain and an alpha-helical amphipathic domain, both situated in the YopD C terminus, may represent key protein-protein interaction domains. Therefore, residues within the YopD C terminus were systematically mutagenized. All 68 mutant bacteria were first screened in a variety of assays designed to identify individual residues essential for YopD function, possibly by providing the interaction interface for the docking of other T3S proteins. Mirroring the effect of a full-length yopD gene deletion, five mutant bacteria were defective for both yop regulatory control and effector delivery. Interestingly, all mutations clustered to hydrophobic amino acids of the amphipathic domain. Also situated within this domain, two additional mutants rendered YopD primarily defective in the control of Yop synthesis and secretion. Significantly, protein-protein interaction studies revealed that functionally compromised YopD variants were also defective in self-oligomerization and in the ability to engage another translocator protein, LcrV. Thus, the YopD amphipathic domain facilitates the formation of YopD/YopD and YopD/LcrV interactions, two critical events in the type III secretion process."
https://openalex.org/W2044858313,"Calcium-Response Factor (CaRF) was first identified as a transcription factor based on its affinity for a neuronal-selective calcium-response element (CaRE1) in the gene encoding Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). However, because CaRF shares no homology with other transcription factors, its properties and gene targets have remained unknown. Here we show that the DNA binding domain of CaRF has been highly conserved across evolution and that CaRF binds DNA directly in a sequence-specific manner in the absence of other eukaryotic cofactors. Using a binding site selection screen we identify a high-affinity consensus CaRF response element (cCaRE) that shares significant homology with the CaRE1 element of Bdnf. In a genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP-Seq), we identified 176 sites of CaRF-specific binding (peaks) in neuronal genomic DNA. 128 of these peaks are within 10kB of an annotated gene, and 60 are within 1kB of an annotated transcriptional start site. At least 138 of the CaRF peaks contain a common 10-bp motif with strong statistical similarity to the cCaRE, and we provide evidence predicting that CaRF can bind independently to at least 64.5% of these motifs in vitro. Analysis of this set of putative CaRF targets suggests the enrichment of genes that regulate intracellular signaling cascades. Finally we demonstrate that expression of a subset of these target genes is altered in the cortex of Carf knockout (KO) mice. Together these data strongly support the characterization of CaRF as a unique transcription factor and provide the first insight into the program of CaRF-regulated transcription in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2013853691,"Neutrophils play important roles in host innate immunity and various inflammation-related diseases. In addition, neutrophils represent an excellent system for studying directional cell migration. However, neutrophils are terminally differentiated cells that are short lived and refractory to transfection; thus, they are not amenable for existing gene silencing techniques. Here we describe the development of a method to silence gene expression efficiently in primary mouse neutrophils. A mouse stem cell virus-based retroviral vector was modified to express short hairpin RNAs and fluorescent marker protein at high levels in hematopoietic cells and used to infect mouse bone marrow cells prior to reconstitution of the hematopoietic system in lethally irradiated mice. This method was used successfully to silence the expression of Gβ1 and/or Gβ2 in mouse neutrophils. Knockdown of Gβ2 appeared to affect primarily the directionality of neutrophil chemotaxis rather than motility, whereas knockdown of Gβ1 had no significant effect. However, knockdown of both Gβ1 and Gβ2 led to significant reduction in motility and responsiveness. In addition, knockdown of Gβ1 but not Gβ2 inhibited the ability of neutrophils to kill ingested bacteria, and only double knockdown resulted in significant reduction in bacterial phagocytosis. Therefore, we have developed a short hairpin RNA-based method to effectively silence gene expression in mouse neutrophils for the first time, which allowed us to uncover divergent roles of Gβ1 and Gβ2 in the regulation of neutrophil functions.

Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes in the blood and play an essential role in the early stages of the innate immune responses by ingesting and killing invading pathogens. In response to inflammatory stimuli, neutrophils first adhere to and extravasate through blood vessels and then migrate through the interstitial tissue toward the site of inflammation. Although neutrophils play an important role in the host defense, uncontrolled inflammatory reactions are associated with a variety of pathological conditions, including ischemia-reperfusion injury during heart attack and strokes, arteriosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and allergic reactions (1Kelly M.

Therefore, understanding how neutrophil recruitment and function is regulated is critical for developing potential treatments for a number of disorders. Neutrophils are also a fine model system to study directional cell migration and chemotaxis because of their ability to migrate rapidly and directionally under a shallow gradient of chemoattractants. Chemotaxis is a fundamental biological process used by a variety of cell types and underlies a wide range of developmental, physiological, and pathophysiological events. It consists of two basic components, directionality and motility (4Parent C.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 5Wu D.

Despite basic scientific and clinical importance of neutrophil research, it has been hindered by the fact that these cells are terminally differentiated, short lived, and thus not amenable to in vitro manipulations, including transfection. Targeted gene inactivation in mice has been the only approach to provide primary neutrophils for loss of function studies. Although these studies have provided novel insights into neutrophil biology, the approach is costly and time-consuming. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a more efficient approach to study neutrophils. RNA interference has been shown to be a rapid and powerful tool for knocking down gene expression in a sequence-specific fashion. Compared with chemically synthesized small interfering RNA, short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) can be stably expressed in hard-to-transfect primary cells and in whole organisms (11Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Sachidanandam R. Hannon G.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 265: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the miR30-shRNA cassette has been reported to yield a higher level of shRNA and more efficient knockdown than a simple shRNA design (12Silva J.M. Li M.Z. Chang K. Ge W. Golding M.C. Rickles R.J. Siolas D. Hu G. Paddison P.J. Schlabach M.R. Sheth N. Bradshaw J. Burchard J. Kulkarni A. Cavet G. Sachidanandam R. McCombie W.R. Cleary M.A. Elledge S.J. Hannon G.J. Nat.

Simon M.I. Fraser I.D. BMC Mol. Biol. 2007; 8: 98Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have silenced multiple target genes simultaneously to overcome isoform redundancy issues (14Hwang J.I.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9493-9498Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), demonstrating the powerful capabilities of this microRNA-based shRNA design. Although shRNA-mediated gene silencing was successful in neutrophil-like cell lines, such as differentiated HL-60, these cells may not faithfully recapitulate the biology of primary neutrophils. In addition, these cell lines cannot be used for in vivo studies. By taking advantage of pluripotent differentiation potentials of hematopoietic stem cells, we describe the development of a novel method to silence gene expression in primary neutrophils in mice using a retrovirus expressing shRNAs. Using this new method, we demonstrated that Gβ2 is primarily involved in regulating directionality rather than motility of neutrophil chemotaxis, and Gβ1 is involved in bacterial killing by neutrophils. The initial retroviral vector MIGR1 (mouse stem cell virus-internal ribosome entry site-green fluorescent protein-retrovirus-1) and the packaging vector pCL-ECO were generous gifts from Dr. Diane Krause (Yale University). For the LTR-YFP-shGβ2 vector, we replaced GFP in MIGR1 with YFP-miR-shGβ2, which was amplified by PCR from pSLIK-miR-shGβ2 and carries a targeting sequence of TGCTCATGTATTCCCACGACAA (14Hwang J.I.

For the CMV-YFP-shRNA vectors, the CMV promoter was amplified from the pAAV-MCS vector (Stratagene (Cedar Creek, TX)) by PCR and inserted between the LTR and YFP-miR-shRNA. miR-shRNA sequences for Gβ1 knockdown were designed by using the RNA interference Codex algorithm (available on the World Wide Web). Four targeting sequences were tested (A, GCGACTCTTTCTCAGATCACAA; B, ATCTGGGACAGTTATACCACAA; C, AACATTATCTGTGGTATCACAT; D, GGCCGAGCAACTGAAGAACCAA). The D sequence was used for the knockdown studies in neutrophils. To generate plasmid containing tandem shRNAs, miR30-shGβ2 was amplified by PCR and inserted downstream of miR-Gβ1. Td-Tomato was amplified and inserted into pGEX-3X (GE Healthcare) for the bacterial killing assay. All constructs were verified by sequencing. We used PHE (Phoenix Ecotropic) cells, which are capable of producing viral gag-pol and envelope proteins, as the packaging cell line (16Swift S. Lorens J. Achacoso P. Nolan G.P. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 10.17.14-10.17.29Google Scholar). PHE and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in 90% Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in humidified air. One day prior to transfection, PHE cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 106 cells/T 75 flask. Retroviral vector and pCL-ECO were co-transfected into cells using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two days later, the medium containing viruses was concentrated using Amicon Ultra columns (Millipore, Billerica, MA). For viral titer determination, serial dilutions of virus supernatants were added to NIH 3T3 cells in a 24-well plate, followed by centrifugation at room temperature to enhance the transduction efficiency. Twenty-four hours later, cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer. Allophycocyanin (APC)-CD11b, PerCP-B220, and APC-CD3ɛ antibodies were purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). APC-Gr1 and Percp-Ly-6G antibodies were from BD (San Jose, CA). The single color flow analysis was done in the Guava EasyCyte Mini Base System (Millipore), and the multiple color flow analysis was performed in an LSR II fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyzer (BD Biosciences). Cell sorting was performed by a FACS Aria sorter (BD Biosciences). Results were analyzed by FlowJo software (Treestar, Ashland, OR). Western blotting was performed with the following antibodies: anti-Ser(P)-473-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-Gβ2 and anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-β-actin (Sigma), and anti-β-tubulin antibody (collected from the supernatant of a hybridoma cell line). The proteins were detected by using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). C57BL/6 mice, aged 8–12 weeks, were obtained from Taconic (Germantown, NY). The donor mice were treated with 5-fluorouracil (Sigma) at 150 mg/kg to enrich hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Three days later, bone marrow cells were harvested from femurs and tibias and cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium containing 20% endotoxin-free fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 50 ng/ml recombinant murine stem cell factor, 10 ng/ml recombinant murine interleukin-3, and 10 ng/ml recombinant human interleukin-6 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 2 days. Cells were then infected twice with viruses in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Millipore). The transduced bone marrow cells were transplanted back into lethally irradiated recipient mice (9.5 grays; γ-rays) by retro-orbital injection. Eight weeks later, the transplanted mice were euthanized for the further analysis. The use and care of animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Yale University. Neutrophils were isolated from bone marrows by using discontinuous Percoll gradient as described previously (17Dong X. Wu D. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The purity of the preparation was verified by Ly6G staining, which is above 95% pure for neutrophils. fMLP was purchased from Sigma. The chemotaxis assay using a Dunn chamber was carried out as described previously (18Zicha D. Dunn G. Jones G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 75: 449-457PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. To minimize inconsistency between assays, we monitored chemoattractant gradients using free fluorescein isothiocyanate dye. Only cells under certain gradient characteristics were analyzed and included in our statistical analysis (supplemental Fig. S1A). Time lapse image series acquired in the aforementioned chemotaxis experiments were analyzed using the MetaMorph image analysis software. The software calculates the x,y coordinate of the centroid of a cell that is designated for tracking in each of the images. Several parameters that reflect the chemotactic behaviors of a cell are obtained from these timed coordinate series. Because the cells in general do not move with a constant velocity, they often move a distance that is less than the noise level of the cell tracking algorithm in the short time interval between two consecutive frames. To exclude those meaningless tracking results from the data analysis, we set a cut-off of 7.5 μm, which represents one-half of an average body length of a polarized neutrophil, as the minimal distance that a cell has to travel in order for the coordinate to be included in the following analyses. We computed the following parameters to quantify the chemotactic behaviors of a cell (supplemental Fig. S1B). Assuming that a cell migration trace consists of n points (p1, p2, … pn) in that order so that they have coordinates (xi,yi)i= 1,2… .n, respectively, let Δxi = xi+ 1 − xi,Δyi = yi+ 1 − yi. Then the distances between consecutive points are as follows. The directionality error angle (αi) was calculated as follows, αi = (180/π)arccos(Δxi/Di), where i = 1, 2, … n. This measures the angle between the cell migration direction and the gradient direction. We take the average directionality angle for all pi values. A smaller value indicates that the cell is more closely following the gradient. Motility is calculated as follows, motility = |pn − p0|/elapsed time. This measures the overall cell migration speed. λ-Carrageenan was purchased from Sigma. Air pouches were generated by subcutaneously injecting 3 ml of sterile-filtered air on day 0 and day 3. At day 6, carrageenan suspension (5 mg in 0.5 ml of sterile, pyrogen-free saline) was injected into the air pouch. 4 h later, pouch exudates were recovered with 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 3 mm EDTA (19Di Lorenzo A. Fernández-Hernando C. Cirino G. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14552-14557Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The total cell count was measured using the Guava EasyCyte Mini Base System (Millipore). Cells were then stained with APC-CD11b and Percp-Ly-6G and subjected for flow cytometric analysis using an LSR II FACS analyzer. Neutrophils were defined as Ly-6G+CD11b+ cells. Escherichia coli (DH10B) transformed with pGEX-Td-Tomato plasmid was induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to express Td-Tomato, the red fluorescence protein. Bone marrow was isolated from mouse tibia and femur of hind legs and then incubated at 37 °C in the presence of bacteria expressing red fluorescence at a ratio of 1:10 for 15 min. Non-internalized bacteria were then removed by washing three times by centrifugation at 100 × g for 5 min in Hanks’ buffer with 1% bovine serum albumin, and fluorescence intensity at this time point was used as a measurement of phagocytosis. Following this initial bacterial loading, cells were incubated at 37 °C for the time periods indicated prior to fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde. Bone marrow cells were then labeled with APC-conjugated anti-mouse Gr1 in order to identify the neutrophil population, and fluorescence was then assessed by flow cytometry using a BD LSRII FACS analyzer. To develop an efficient method for loss-of-function study of mouse primary neutrophils, we tested whether the lentiviral miR30-embedded shRNA production system developed by Simon and colleagues (15Shin K.J. Wall E.A. Zavzavadjian J.R. Santat L.A. Liu J. Hwang J.I. Rebres R. Roach T. Seaman W. Simon M.I. Fraser I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13212-13217Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) would be able to silence gene expression in neutrophils in a scheme outlined in supplemental Fig. S2. Briefly, lentiviruses expressing GFP were used to infect mouse bone marrow cells, which were subsequently used to generate neutrophils after transplantation into lethally irradiated recipient mice. We found that this lentivirus-based system did not infect mouse bone marrow cells at a high efficiency (data not shown). We decided to switch to a mouse stem cell virus-based system because mouse stem cell virus infects hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells at high efficiencies (21Leimig T. Mann L. Martin Mdel P. Bonten E. Persons D. Knowles J. Allay J.A. Cunningham J. Nienhuis A.W. Smeyne R. d'Azzo A. Blood. 2002; 99: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The insert encoding Venus fluorescence protein (a variant of YFP) and an shRNA targeting the β2 subunit of G protein embedded within the miR30 sequence was subcloned from the lentiviral system into MIGR1, a mouse stem cell virus-based retroviral vector (Fig. 1A). We refer to this vector as LTR-YFP-shGβ2. The reasons for choosing the Gβ2 shRNA in this study were as follows: 1) the shRNA was shown to be effective and specific (15Shin K.J. Wall E.A. Zavzavadjian J.R. Santat L.A. Liu J. Hwang J.I. Rebres R. Roach T. Seaman W. Simon M.I. Fraser I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13759-13764Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar); 2) Gβ2 is one of the two Gβs abundantly expressed in mouse neutrophils based on our expression microarray analysis (Fig. 1B); and 3) the role of Gβ in neutrophil chemotaxis has not been investigated. We infected bone marrow cells isolated from C57BL/6 mice with LTR-YFP-shGβ2 virus and transplanted them into lethally irradiated C57BL/6 recipients. After 8 weeks of recovery and repopulation, neutrophils were isolated from the transplanted mice and analyzed for YFP expression. As shown in Fig. 1C, 44.92% of isolated neutrophils were YFP-positive, suggesting that this retroviral vector provides reasonable infection efficiency. We subsequently sorted the YFP-positive neutrophils (Fig. 1D) and analyzed them for shRNA-mediated knockdown efficiency. Because YFP and the shRNA were expressed from the same transcript, we expected the YFP-positive cells to express the shRNA. We observed about a 50% reduction in Gβ2 expression in neutrophils expressing YFP (Fig. 1E). However, little effect on chemoattractant (fMLP)-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 was observed. This phosphorylation event is known to depend on Gβγ (14Hwang J.I. Choi S. Fraser I.D. Chang M.S. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9493-9498Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Bommakanti R.K. Vinayak S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38870-38876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the LTR promoter-based vector may not produce sufficient shRNA to allow effective knockdown of Gβ2 and result in the expected functional defects. To improve the shRNA production, we decided to add a strong transcriptional promoter/enhancer by inserting a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter with a β-globin intron between the 5′-LTR and the YFP-miR30-shRNA expression cassette (Fig. 2A). The β-globin intron enhances transcriptional activities as an enhancer-like element (23Komiya E. Kondoh M. Mizuguchi H. Fujii M. Utoguchi N. Nakanishi T. Watanabe Y. Placenta. 2006; 27: 934-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). A second construct with the luciferase shRNA embedded in the miR30 backbone in place of the Gβ2 shRNA was made as a control for our studies described below. These two new constructs are referred to as CMV-YFP-shGβ2 and CMV-YFP-shLuc. We first tested these new constructs by infecting NIH 3T3 cells and found that cells infected with viruses generated from the new constructs (CMV-YFP-shLuc or -Gβ2) expressed higher levels of YFP than those generated from LTR-YFP-shGβ2 at the same multiplicity of infection (Fig. 2, B and C). Importantly, despite the same Gβ2 shRNA sequence in both LTR- and CMV-driven vectors, CMV-YFP-shGβ2 yielded much more efficient knockdown of Gβ2 expression than LTR-YFP-shGβ2 (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that the CMV promoter coupled with the β-globin intron sequence leads to higher expression levels than the viral LTR and that higher shRNA expression translates into more effective gene expression knockdown. Next, we tested whether the modified vector would be more efficient in silencing gene expression in mouse neutrophils. The CMV-YFP-shLuc and CMV-YFP-shGβ2 viruses were used to infect mouse bone marrow cells, which were subsequently transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Fig. 3A shows a representative set of flow cytometric analyses of neutrophils isolated from these transplanted mice. In this experiment, 30% of CMV-YFP-shGβ2 neutrophils were YFP-positive, whereas close to 60% of CMV-YFP-shLuc neutrophils were YFP-positive. The YFP-positive neutrophils were isolated by FACS, and their purity is shown in Fig. 3B. The sorted YFP-positive neutrophils were then subjected to Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 3C, the level of Gβ2 was markedly reduced in sorted YFP-positive neutrophils expressing shGβ2 compared with neutrophils from non-transplanted mice or neutrophils expressing shLuc. In all of the experiments performed, there was 70–85% reduction in Gβ2 expression levels in cells expressing shGβ2 compared with the controls. Importantly, there was a clear reduction in fMLP-induced Akt phosphorylation in cells expressing YFP-shGβ2 compared with the controls (Fig. 3C). Of note, silencing Gβ2 expression in neutrophil did not affect the expression of Gβ1 or Gαi2 (Fig. 3C). Because Gβ1 is also highly expressed in murine neutrophils (Fig. 1B) and it may have a redundancy function as Gβ2, we also tried to silence Gβ1 expression using our new vector. Four different shRNAs targeting Gβ1 were designed, and the most potent shRNA (shGβ1-D) was identified by significantly suppressing endogenous Gβ1 expression in NIH 3T3 cells (supplemental Fig. S3). This shRNA was used in the following study. After bone marrow transplantation, we sorted out the YFP-positive neutrophils transduced with Gβ1 shRNA or control luciferase shRNA (Fig. 4A) and performed Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 4B, the level of Gβ1 was significantly reduced in sorted YFP-positive neutrophils expressing shGβ1 compared with control neutrophils from non-transplanted mice or neutrophils expressing shLuc. One of the main powers of the miR30-shRNA system is to simultaneously knock down multiple different gene targets (13Zhu X. Santat L.A. Chang M.S. Liu J. Zavzavadjian J.R. Wall E.A. Kivork C. Simon M.I. Fraser I.D. BMC Mol. Biol. 2007; 8: 98Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To exploit this possibility in our system, we tried a double knockdown of Gβ1 and Gβ2 in neutrophils. The second miR-shRNA was inserted downstream of the first miR-shRNA, and both shRNAs were driven by the enhanced CMV promoter (Fig. 4C). Similarly, we sorted out the YFP-positive neutrophils transduced with Gβ1 shRNA and Gβ2 shRNA (double knockdown) or control luciferase shRNA (Fig. 4D), and we observed the efficient suppression of Gβ1 and Gβ2 expression in neutrophils (Fig. 4E), suggesting the successful knockdown of multiple gene targets in vivo. Next, we performed three functional assays for transduced neutrophils. First, we tested the effect of Gβ knockdown on in vitro neutrophil chemotaxis using a Dunn chamber, in which a shallow fMLP gradient was established and cell migration was tracked using time lapse videomicroscopy. Two key parameters were obtained from analysis of the time lapse image series: directionality error (reflecting how well a cell follows the chemoattractant gradient) and motility (see “Materials and Methods” for details). Significant portions of the neutrophils isolated from transplanted mice were YFP-negative. Supplemental Fig. S4A shows bright field and fluorescence images of neutrophils in Dunn chambers, in which YFP-positive and -negative neutrophils can be readily recognized and tracked. These YFP-negative cells have little or no shGβ2 expression and therefore normal levels of Gβ2 protein (supplemental Fig. S4, B and C). Thus, these YFP-negative cells served as excellent internal controls for the Dunn chamber chemotaxis assay, which are known to be variable. In addition, paired statistical analyses were used to identify small differences in chemotaxis parameters caused by gene silencing. Analysis of chemotactic parameters of YFP-positive cells and negative cells revealed that YFP-positive neutrophils isolated from CMV-YFP-shGβ2 virus-infected mice showed impaired directionality compared with YFP-negative cells (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, no significant directionality defect was detected in Gβ1-silenced neutrophils compared with control cells (Fig. 5A), and no further directionality defect was observed in Gβ1 and Gβ2 double knockdown neutrophils as compared with Gβ2-silenced cells (Fig. 5A), suggesting that Gβ2 is the major isoform responsible for neutrophil directionality. The effect of Gβ1 knockdown or Gβ2 knockdown on motility appeared to be insignificant (Fig. 5B). Neutrophils suppressing both Gβ1 and Gβ2 expression (Fig. 5B) showed a modest but significant reduction in motility. In addition, ∼30% of Gβ1/Gβ2 double knockdown neutrophils failed to respond to fMLP and were immobile, whereas knockdown of either Gβ subunit had no significant effects on the number of responding cells (Fig. 5C). As important controls, there were no differences between YFP-positive and -negative neutrophils isolated from mice transplanted with CMV-YFP-shLuc virus-infected bone marrow cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Therefore, these results together indicate that Gβ2, but not Gβ1, has an important role in neutrophil directionality regulation, whereas both Gβ subunits are involved in motility regulation. To examine neutrophil recruitment in vivo, we used the air pouch model (24Colville-Nash P. Lawrence T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 225: 181-189PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, subcutaneous injection of air into dorsal surface of mice results in the formation of an air pouch, which has a lining morphologically similar to the synovium. Carrageenan, polysaccharide extracted from red seaweeds, was injected into the pouch to induce robust inflammation, as indicated by an increase in total neutrophil number and higher neutrophil percentage in the pouch exudates compared with those in mice injected with saline (data not shown). Among these neutrophils recruited into the pouch, two or three populations (YFP-low, YFP-medium, and YFP-high) were observed based on their YFP expression (Fig. 6A). In our analysis, we refer to YFP-high cells as YFP-positive cells and YFP-low cells as YFP-negative cells. As indicated in supplemental Fig. S4, YFP-negative cells also served as internal controls for YFP-positive cells in this assay. For each animal, the ratio between YFP-positive neutrophils and YFP-negative neutrophils in the pouch exudates (Fig. 6A, bottom), which reflects the migration ability of transduced neutrophils, was normalized based on the same ratio in the blood (Fig. 6A, top). As expected, neutrophils expressing luciferase shRNA (shLuc) migrate normally in vivo (the ratio of YFP+/YFP− is 0.97 ± 0.05; Fig. 6B). However, the infiltration of Gβ2-silenced neutrophils was markedly inhibited (the ratio of YFP+/YFP−"
https://openalex.org/W1967986424,"GABA(A) receptors are composed predominantly of alphabetagamma receptors, which mediate primarily synaptic inhibition, and alphabetadelta receptors, which mediate primarily extrasynaptic inhibition. At saturating GABA concentrations, the barbiturate pentobarbital substantially increased the amplitude and desensitization of the alpha1beta3delta receptor but not the alpha1beta3gamma2L receptor currents. To explore the structural domains of the delta subunit that are involved in pentobarbital potentiation and increased desensitization of alpha1beta3delta currents, chimeric cDNAs were constructed by progressive replacement of gamma2L subunit sequence with a delta subunit sequence or a delta subunit sequence with a gamma2L subunit sequence, and HEK293T cells were co-transfected with alpha1 and beta3 subunits or alpha1 and beta3 subunits and a gamma2L, delta, or chimeric subunit. Currents evoked by a saturating concentration of GABA or by co-application of GABA and pentobarbital were recorded using the patch clamp technique. By comparing the extent of enhancement and changes in kinetic properties produced by pentobarbital among chimeric and wild type receptors, we concluded that although potentiation of alpha1beta3delta currents by pentobarbital required the delta subunit sequence from the N terminus to proline 241 in the first transmembrane domain (M1), increasing desensitization of alpha1beta3delta currents required a delta subunit sequence from the N terminus to isoleucine 235 in M1. These findings suggest that the delta subunit N terminus and N-terminal portion of the M1 domain are, at least in part, involved in transduction of the allosteric effect of pentobarbital to enhance alpha1beta3delta currents and that this effect involves a distinct but overlapping structural domain from that involved in altering desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2003627582,"Background Decision analysis and game theory [1], [2] have proved useful tools in various biodiversity conservation planning and modeling contexts [3]–[5]. This paper shows how game theory may be used to inform group decisions in biodiversity conservation scenarios by modeling conflicts between stakeholders to identify Pareto–inefficient Nash equilibria. These are cases in which each agent pursuing individual self–interest leads to a worse outcome for all, relative to other feasible outcomes. Three case studies from biodiversity conservation contexts showing this feature are modeled to demonstrate how game–theoretical representation can inform group decision-making. Methodology and Principal Findings The mathematical theory of games is used to model three biodiversity conservation scenarios with Pareto–inefficient Nash equilibria: (i) a two–agent case involving wild dogs in South Africa; (ii) a three–agent raptor and grouse conservation scenario from the United Kingdom; and (iii) an n–agent fish and coral conservation scenario from the Philippines. In each case there is reason to believe that traditional mechanism–design solutions that appeal to material incentives may be inadequate, and the game–theoretical analysis recommends a resumption of further deliberation between agents and the initiation of trust—and confidence—building measures. Conclusions and Significance Game theory can and should be used as a normative tool in biodiversity conservation contexts: identifying scenarios with Pareto–inefficient Nash equilibria enables constructive action in order to achieve (closer to) optimal conservation outcomes, whether by policy solutions based on mechanism design or otherwise. However, there is mounting evidence [6] that formal mechanism–design solutions may backfire in certain cases. Such scenarios demand a return to group deliberation and the creation of reciprocal relationships of trust."
https://openalex.org/W2059105292,"We previously identified Asn(331) in transmembrane segment 7 (TM7) as a key residue determining substrate affinity in Hxt2, a moderately high-affinity facilitative glucose transporter of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To gain further insight into the structural basis of substrate recognition by yeast glucose transporters, we have now studied Hxt7, whose affinity for glucose is the highest among the major hexose transporters. The functional role of Asp(340) in Hxt7, the residue corresponding to Asn(331) of Hxt2, was examined by replacing it with each of the other 19 amino acids. Such replacement of Asp(340) generated transporters with various affinities for glucose, with the affinity of the Cys(340) mutant surpassing that of the wild-type Hxt7. To examine the structural role of Asp(340) in the substrate translocation pathway, we performed cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the 21 residues in TM7 of a functional Cys-less Hxt7 mutant in conjunction with exposure to the hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagent p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS). The transport activity of the D340C mutant of Cys-less Hxt7, in which Asp(340) is replaced with Cys, was completely inhibited by pCMBS, indicating that Asp(340) is located in a water-accessible position. This D340C mutant showed a sensitivity to pCMBS that was approximately 70 times that of the wild-type Hxt7, and it was protected from pCMBS inhibition by the substrates d-glucose and 2-deoxy-d-glucose but not by l-glucose. These results indicate that Asp(340) is situated at or close to a substrate recognition site and is a key residue determining high-affinity glucose transport by Hxt7, supporting the notion that yeast glucose transporters share a common mechanism for substrate recognition."

Accurate identification and genotyping of Avipoxvirus is critical to the study of this disease and how it interacts with other pathogens, but currently available methods rely on invasive sampling of pox-like lesions and may be especially harmful in smaller birds. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we present a nested TaqMan Real-Time PCR for the detection of the Avipoxvirus 4b core protein gene in archived blood samples from Hawaiian birds. The method was successful in amplifying Avipoxvirus DNA from packed blood cells of one of seven Hawaiian honeycreepers with confirmed Avipoxvirus infections and 13 of 28 Hawaìi `amakihi (Hemignathus virens) with suspected Avipoxvirus infections based on the presence of pox-like lesions. Mixed genotype infections have not previously been documented in Hawaìi but were observed in two individuals in this study. Conclusions/Significance We anticipate that this method will be applicable to other closely related strains of Avipoxvirus and will become an important and useful tool in global studies of the epidemiology of Avipoxvirus."
https://openalex.org/W2069341822,"We present a general methodology in order to build mathematical models of genetic regulatory networks. This approach is based on the mass action law and on the Jacob and Monod operon model. The mathematical models are built symbolically by the Mathematica software package GeneticNetworks. This package accepts as input the interaction graphs of the transcriptional activators and repressors of a biological process and, as output, gives the mathematical model in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations. All the relevant biological parameters are chosen automatically by the software. Within this framework, we show that concentration dependent threshold effects in biology emerge from the catalytic properties of genes and its associated conservation laws. We apply this methodology to the segment patterning in Drosophila early development and we calibrate the genetic transcriptional network responsible for the patterning of the gap gene proteins Hunchback and Knirps, along the antero-posterior axis of the Drosophila embryo. In this approach, the zygotically produced proteins Hunchback and Knirps do not diffuse along the antero-posterior axis of the embryo of Drosophila, developing a spatial pattern due to concentration dependent thresholds. This shows that patterning at the gap genes stage can be explained by the concentration gradients along the embryo of the transcriptional regulators."

Peptidoglycan (or murein) is a major stress-bearing component of the bacterial cell wall. This polymer is made of glycan chains interconnected by covalent cross-links between short peptides. It acts as an exoskeleton and plays a key role in determining and maintaining cell shape throughout the cell cycle. The first steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis occur in the cytoplasm where specific enzymes catalyze the formation of the uridinediphospho-n-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide (UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide) 4The abbreviations used are: MurNAcN-acetylmuramic acidGlcNAcN-acetylglucosaminePBPpenicillin-binding proteinMICminimal inhibitory concentrationVan-FLvancomycin BODIPY-FL conjugateddlLcd-Ala-d-Ala ligase gene from L. lactis subsp. cremorisddlLpd-Ala-d-Lac ligase gene from L. plantarumddlAStd-Ala-d-Lac ligase gene from S. thermophilusldhDLhd-Lac dehydrogenase gene from L. helveticusaadd-Ala-d-Ala dipeptidase gene from L. plantarumVanXAd-Ala-d-Ala dipeptidase gene from E. faeciumHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightORFopen reading frameMSmass spectroscopyd-Lacd-lactate. precursor (1Barreteau H.

After the addition of n-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc), this precursor is transported through the plasma membrane and incorporated into the peptidoglycan by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (2Sauvage E. Kerff F. Terrak M. Ayala J.A. Charlier P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 234-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). High molecular weight PBPs act in transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions required for peptidoglycan polymers formation and cross-linking, whereas low molecular weight PBPs are suggested to be carboxypeptidases and endopeptidases involved in peptide chains processing during peptidoglycan synthesis and maturation. PBPs collaborate with peptidoglycan hydrolases, possibly through the assembly of multienzymatic complexes, which together constitute the peptidoglycan biosynthesis machinery (3Carballido-López R.

Bacterial cell morphology is the result of a tightly regulated process coupling peptidoglycan synthesis with cell growth and cell division. Proper cell shape requires proper localization and activity of the peptidoglycan biosynthesis machinery. PBP localization studies performed in bacilli and cocci suggest that recruitment of these proteins is mediated by structural determinants of the cytoskeleton (e.g. the FtsZ ring at the septum and actin-like filaments along the longitudinal axis of the cell) (3Carballido-López R.

Microbiol. 2005; 55: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Likewise, proper recruitment of carboxypeptidases and other peptidoglycan hydrolases may also depend on the specific location of their substrate during cell growth (11Morlot C. Noirclerc-Savoye M. Zapun A. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1641-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Priyadarshini R. Popham D.L. Young K.D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5345-5355Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this study the flexibility of the cell wall biosynthesis machinery toward a new substrate was examined in the Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis. In terms of shape and PBP content, L. lactis is closely related to other ovoid cocci, such as streptococci and enterococci, including a number of pathogenic species. The primary structure of L. lactis peptidoglycan monomer is GlcNAc-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu (or isoglutamine)-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, with a d-Asn (or a d-Asp) cross-bridge residue attached to l-Lys (14Courtin P.

Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 3752-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The d-Ala C-terminal residue of L. lactis peptidoglycan peptide chains was changed to d-Lac. To this end, specific genes involved in peptidoglycan precursor synthesis from Lactobacillus plantarum, another lactic acid bacterium, were transferred and expressed in L. lactis (Fig. 1). In L. plantarum, the peptide chain ended with d-Ala-d-Lac, which makes this bacterium naturally resistant to vancomycin due to the fact that d-Ala-d-Lac termini are not targets for the antibiotic (18Deghorain M. Goffin P. Fontaine L. Mainardi J.L. Daniel R. Errington J. Hallet B. Hols P. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4332-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Goffin P. Deghorain M. Mainardi J.L. Tytgat I. Champomier-Vergès M.C. Kleerebezem M. Hols P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6750-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The resulting L. lactis mutants produced different levels of precursors terminated by d-Ala-d-Lac instead of d-Ala-d-Ala and showed different levels of resistance to vancomycin. Utilization of the new substrate forced L. lactis peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway to adapt, leading to significant changes in peptidoglycan structure and cell morphology. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. The L. lactis subsp. cremoris strain NZ3900 and its derivatives were grown at 28 °C in M17 broth (BD Biosciences) containing 0.5% glucose (M17-glucose). Strains carrying the expression vectors pGIM020, pGIM022, pGIM023, pGIM024, pGIM025, and pGIM026 were grown in the presence of 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol, whereas their ddlLc d-Ala-d-Ala ligase mutant derivatives MD001, MD002, MD003, MD004, and MD006 were selected and cultured on 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 5 μg/ml erythromycin (Sigma). For induction of genes under the control of the nisA expression signals, nisin A (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 0.5 ng/ml. d-Lactate (15 mm; Fluka) was added in the cultures, except for strains expressing the ldhDLh d-Lac dehydrogenase gene from Lactobacillus helveticus. Analysis of growth dependence of the ddlLc mutants toward nisin and d-Lac was performed as followed; overnight cultures were grown in the presence of nisin (0.5 ng/ml), d-Lac (15 mm), erythromycin (5 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (5 μg/ml), washed once, and diluted at an A600 nm of 0.05 in M17-glucose broth containing erythromycin and chloramphenicol supplemented with nisin and d-Lac or just nisin. For pGIM020, a DNA fragment containing the ddlLp d-Ala-d-Lac ligase open reading frame (ORF) and its ribosome binding site was amplified from L. plantarum strain NCIMB8826 with primers DDLPLXP3 and DDLPLXP4 (supplemental Table S1). The 1187-bp PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and ScaI and inserted into the pNZ2650 plasmid (20Hols P. Kleerebezem M. Schanck A.N. Ferain T. Hugenholtz J. Delcour J. de Vos W.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) digested with BamHI and PvuII. The resulting plasmid (pGIM020) contains ddlLp under the control of the PnisA promoter followed by the L. plantarum ldhL transcriptional terminator. For co-expressing ddlLp with the ldhDLh gene of L. helveticus, a 1434-bp fragment encompassing the ldhDLh ORF and promoter sequences was PCR-amplified from L. helveticus CNRZ32 with primers PNZLDHD1-PNZLDHD2 (supplemental Table S1), digested with XbaI and ScaI, and inserted into the XbaI/NspI-digested pGIM020 plasmid to yield pGIM022. Construction of the pGIM023 vector for co-expressing ddlLp and the aad d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptidase gene from L. plantarum as a bicistronic unit under the control of the PnisA promoter was previously described (18Deghorain M. Goffin P. Fontaine L. Mainardi J.L. Daniel R. Errington J. Hallet B. Hols P. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4332-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The same procedure was used for the construction of pGIM024 to co-express ddlLp with the VanXA d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptidase gene of the vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strain BM4147. A 671-bp fragment encompassing the ribosome binding site and ORF of VanXA was amplified from pAT83 plasmid (21Arthur M. Molinas C. Courvalin P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2582-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) using primers VANX1 and VANX2 (supplemental Table S1). The resulting PCR product was digested with BsrGI and BamHI and cloned into similarly digested pGIM020. For the complementation control plasmid pGIM026 expressing the ddlASt d-Ala-d-Ala ligase gene from Streptococcus thermophilus, primers SthddlABam1 and SthddlAKpnI (supplemental Table S1) were used to amplify the ddlASt ribosome binding site and ORF directly from S. thermophilus LMG18311 colonies. The resulting 1104-bp PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and KpnI and inserted into pGIM020 cut with the same enzymes, replacing the ddlLp insert and placing ddlASt under the transcriptional control of the PnisA promoter. Disruption of the ddlLc ligase gene was carried out by homologous recombination-mediated integration of the disruptive plasmid pGIL001. For pGIL001 construction, an internal 574-bp fragment of ddlLc was generated by PCR using the LCDDLDISR1 and LCDDLDISR2 primers (supplemental Table S1). The fragment was digested with PstI and XbaI and cloned into the suicide plasmid pGIZ907 (19Goffin P. Deghorain M. Mainardi J.L. Tytgat I. Champomier-Vergès M.C. Kleerebezem M. Hols P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6750-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) digested with NsiI and XbaI. Chromosomal integration of pGIL001 generated 5′- and 3′-terminal-truncated copies of ddlLc separated by vector sequences. These include an erythromycin resistance gene as well as an outward-facing promoter PLdh (19Goffin P. Deghorain M. Mainardi J.L. Tytgat I. Champomier-Vergès M.C. Kleerebezem M. Hols P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6750-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) to ensure expression of the murF gene located downstream of ddlLcin L. lactis. Inactivation of the dacA gene was carried out using the disruptive plasmid pGIBD006. A PCR fragment containing the dacA ORF was generated using the BLD_DacAUpNcoI and BLD_DacADownSacI primers (supplemental Table S1) and cloned into the pGMTEasy vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was digested with SphI and KasI to provide an internal fragment of the dacA gene that was then cloned into pUC18Ery (22van Kranenburg R. Marugg J.D. van Swam I.I. Willem N.J. de Vos W.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Chromosomal integration of pGIBD006 produced two truncated copies of the dacA gene separated by vector sequences. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of vancomycin displayed by the wild type and mutant strains of L. lactis were determined by the E-test method (AB-Biodisk). Cells were plated on solid medium and incubated for 24 h at 28 °C in the presence of an E-test strip containing a gradient of vancomycin (from 0.016 to 256 μg/ml). MIC values are indicated by the position where the edge of the inhibition ellipse intersects the side of the strip. For population heterogeneity analysis, serial cultures of the primary mutant MD003 and the control strains MD006 and NZ3900 (pNZ8048) were performed by 100-fold diluting overnight-grown cultures into 10 ml of fresh medium every day (∼10 generations intervals). At each passage diluted samples were plated on increasing concentrations of vancomycin (from 0 to 1024 μg/ml), and subpopulations displaying different levels of vancomycin resistance were estimated by expressing the number of colony forming units obtained for each antibiotic concentration per ml of culture and A600 nm unit. Cells were grown in M17-glucose broth supplemented with antibiotics, nisin, and d-Lac (when appropriate) to an A600 nm of 0.7 and treated with bacitracin (200 μg/ml; Sigma) for 90 min before harvesting by centrifugation. Peptidoglycan precursors were then extracted with 20% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) as previously described (19Goffin P. Deghorain M. Mainardi J.L. Tytgat I. Champomier-Vergès M.C. Kleerebezem M. Hols P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6750-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The reference strain used, PH8076, is an erythromycin-resistant L. lactis strain isogenic to NZ3900. 5P. Hols, unpublished data. The erythromycin resistance marker carried by this strain was inserted together with the nisR and nisK regulatory genes in the pepN locus using the integration vector pNZ9573 (23de Ruyter P.G. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strain also contains a mutation in the α-acetolactate decarboxylase gene aldB that has no effect on cell wall peptidoglycan composition. PH8076 was transformed with the pNZ8048 empty vector and used as a wild type reference for muropeptide analysis. Peptidoglycan from L. lactis strains PH8076 (pNZ8048), MD003, and MD003-128 was prepared as previously described (14Courtin P. Miranda G. Guillot A. Wessner F. Mézange C. Domakova E. Kulakauskas S.

Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1713-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Purified peptidoglycan (4 mg dry weight in 500 μl) was then digested with mutanolysin (2500 units/ml; Sigma) in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) for 19 h at 37 °C under rotational shaking. Muropeptides were reduced with sodium borohydride and separated by reverse phase HPLC using a Hypersil ODS column (C18, 250 × 4.6 mm; 5 μm; ThermoHypersil-Keystone) at 50 °C as described by Courtin et al. (14Courtin P. Miranda G. Guillot A. Wessner F. Mézange C. Domakova E. Kulakauskas S. Chapot-Chartier M.P. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5293-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fractions were collected, and 1 μl of the fractions containing muropeptides of interest was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry with a Voyager DE STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix. The structures of the muropeptides I and II were determined by mass spectrometry as described in Arbeloa et al. (24Arbeloa A. Hugonnet J.E. Sentilhes A.C. Josseaume N. Dubost L. Monsempes C. Blanot D. Brouard J.P. Arthur M. J. Biol.

Van-FL staining was essentially performed as previously described by Daniel and Errington (25Daniel R.A. Errington J. Cell. 2003; 113: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Cells from an overnight culture were diluted into fresh M17-glucose medium and grown to early exponential phase (A600 nm = 0.2–0.3) at 30 °C. Culture samples (200 μl) were incubated for 30 min with a mixture of equal amount of vancomycin BODIPY-FL conjugate (Molecular Probes) and unlabeled vancomycin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 3 μg/ml. Cells were fixed in 1.6% formaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline) and mounted on poly-lysine-coated slides (25Daniel R.A. Errington J. Cell. 2003; 113: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.5 μg/ml; Sigma) was added for nucleoid staining. Images were taken using a SonyCoolSnap HQ cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific Ltd) attached to a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. For filamentation induction by methicillin treatment, the antibiotic was added to exponentially growing cultures (A600 nm = 0.1) at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5 μg/ml, and cells were incubated at 28 °C for 4.5 h before microscope observation. For SOLiD sequencing, approximately 5 μg of chromosomal DNA was sheared and size-selected to an average size of 100 bp. P1 and P2 adaptors were ligated and amplified for 15 cycles; 0.2 pg/μl double-stranded DNA library was added to the emulsion with one billion beads according to manufacturer instructions. From 11 million positive beads, corresponding to the MD003-128 strain DNA, 4.6 millions (42%) matched to the L. lactis MG1363 sequence (26Wegmann U. O'Connell-Motherway M. Zomer A. Buist G. Shearman C. Canchaya C. Ventura M. Goesmann A. Gasson M.J. Kuipers O.P. van Sinderen D. Kok J. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3256-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) used as reference for the analysis by Corona-Lite (Applied Biosystems) or MAQ version 0.7.1 software (27Li H. Ruan J. Durbin R. Genome Res. 2008; 18: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). It produced 231 million nucleotides corresponding to a total coverage of 91.6 of the 2,529,478-bp genome. 127 kb (5%) of 2.5 Mb were not covered, and 30.9 kb (1.2%) were determined with ambiguity. Usually the latter were the regions of genome poorly covered with the sequencing reads. 29 kb of these had coverage of less than 5, most of the others less than 10. It should also be mentioned that with the data produced and the analysis tools that were applied, we were not able to detect small indel-like mutations. A key enzyme for determining the C-terminal composition of the peptidoglycan peptide chain is the Ddl ligase that links together the two last residues before their incorporation into the precursor by the MurF enzyme (Fig. 1). In L. lactis, the ddlLc ligase is specific for d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptides formation, whereas the ddlLp ligase of L. plantarum synthesizes d-Ala-d-Lac depsipeptides (Fig. 1). To produce d-Lac-ended peptidoglycan precursors in L. lactis, the L. plantarum ddlLp gene was cloned as a transcriptional fusion with the nisin-inducible promoter PnisA and introduced in NZ3900, a L. lactis strain containing the nisR and nisK regulatory genes required for nisin induction (Fig. 1a, see also “Experimental Procedures”). Because L. lactis exclusively produces the l-isomer of lactate, d-Lac (15 mm) was added to the culture medium to serve as a substrate for the ddlLp ligase. Alternatively, ddlLp was co-expressed with the ldhDLh gene encoding the d-Lac dehydrogenase of L. helveticus to produce d-Lac directly within the cell by pyruvate conversion. Precursors terminated by d-Ala-d-Lac were not detected in the cytoplasm of the strain overexpressing ddlLp alone (NZ3900 (pGIM020), Table 1). However, they represented 25% of the soluble precursors purified from the strain expressing both ddlLp and ldhDLh (NZ3900 (pGIM022), Table 1). This shows that the L. plantarum ddlLp ligase is active in L. lactis and that the MurF enzyme of L. lactis is capable of incorporating d-Ala-d-Lac depsipeptides in the precursors (Fig. 1).TABLE 1Production of peptidoglycan precursors ended by d-Ala-d-Lac in L. lactis subsp. cremoris and impact on vancomycin resistanceStrain (plasmid)Genotyped-Ala-d-Lac ended precursoraPercentage of penta-substituted UDP-MurNAc-pent▵depsi)peptide precursors terminated by d-Ala-d -Lac.Vanco MICHighly resistant coloniesddl ligase gened-Lac dehydrogenase ldhDLhDipeptidase geneddlLcddlLpddlASt%μg/mlNZ3900 (pNZ8048)+−−−−0bNo UDP-MurNAc-tri-d -Ala-d -Lac could be detected.1.5−NZ3900 (pGIM020)++−−−0bNo UDP-MurNAc-tri-d -Ala-d -Lac could be detected.1.5−MD001−+−−−641.5+NZ3900 (pGIM022)++−+−251.5−MD002−+−+−421.5+NZ3900 (pGIM023)++−−aad1003–4+MD003−+−−aad1003–24+NZ3900 (pGIM024)++−−vanXA912–3+MD004−+−−vanXA1006+NZ3900 (pGIM006)+−+−−NDcND, not determined.1.5−MD006−−+−−NDcND, not determined.1.5−a Percentage of penta-substituted UDP-MurNAc-pent▵depsi)peptide precursors terminated by d-Ala-d -Lac.b No UDP-MurNAc-tri-d -Ala-d -Lac could be detected.c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab To increase the ratio of d-Lac- over d-Ala-ended precursors in NZ3900 (pGIM020) and NZ3900 (pGIM022), the endogenous d-Ala-d-Ala ligase gene of L. lactis was disrupted in both strains, yielding the mutated MD001 and MD002 derivatives, respectively (Table 1, see also Fig. 1). The ddlLc gene was also disrupted in a strain (MD006) expressing an heterologous d-Ala-d-Ala ligase from S. thermophilus (ddlASt) to ascertain that the phenotypes observed after changing the peptidoglycan precursor are not simply the consequence of nonspecific polar effects affecting the activity of other genes in the ddlLc locus (see below). Growth of the MD001 and MD002 strains required the presence of nisin in the culture, showing that peptidoglycan synthesis in these two mutants absolutely relies on the heterologous expression of the L. plantarum ligase gene ddlLp (Fig. 2A, data not shown) Prolonged incubation in nisin-deprived medium resulted in a decrease in the optical density of the culture, which is indicative of cell lysis caused by a defect in peptidoglycan synthesis (Fig. 2A). Growth of the control strain MD006 was not dependent on nisin, presumably because of sufficient residual expression of the ddlASt gene in the absence of inducer (data not shown). As expected, the MD002 mutant co-expressing ddlLp with the ldhDLh gene from L. helveticus grew equally well whether d-Lac was added in the culture or not (data not show). However, growth of MD001, which does not produces d-Lac, was also insensitive to the absence of d-Lac in the medium (Fig. 2A). Peptidoglycan precursor analysis showed that MD001 and MD002 still produced a certain amount of d-Ala-ended UDP-MurNac-pentapeptides, although the proportion of d-Lac-ended precursors expressed by the two mutants was significantly increased when compared with the non-mutated strains (Table 1). These results are consistent with our previous data showing that the ddlLp ligase is bispecific, being capable of synthesizing both d-Ala-d-Lac and d-Ala-d-Ala in L. plantarum (18Deghorain M. Goffin P. Fontaine L. Mainardi J.L. Daniel R. Errington J. Hallet B. Hols P. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4332-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is, thus, likely that MD001 utilizes the d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptides produced by ddlLp to sustain cell wall synthesis in a d-Lac-deprived medium. In vancomycin-resistant enterococci, exclusive replacement of d-Ala-d-Ala termini by d-Ala-d-Lac termini requires the production of a d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptidase (VanX) in addition to the d-Ala-d-Lac ligase (VanA/B) and the d-Lac dehydrogenase (VanH) (28Arthur M. Depardieu F. Reynolds P. Courvalin P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A VanX-like d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptidase (Aad) was identified in L. plantarum and was shown to contribute to peptidoglycan precursor selectivity by eliminating the d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptides that are synthesized by the ddlLp ligase (18Deghorain M. Goffin P. Fontaine L. Mainardi J.L. Daniel R. Errington J. Hallet B. Hols P. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4332-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To see whether this dipeptidase could play a VanX-like role by reprogramming peptidoglycan precursor synthesis in L. lactis (Fig. 1), Aad and ddlLp were co-produced in the wild type strain (NZ3900 (pGIM023)) as well as in a ddlLc mutant background (MD003). Equivalent strains were constructed for the co-expression of ddlLp and the VanXA gene from E. faecium BM4147 (N23900 (pGIM024) and MD004, respectively). Low amounts of d-Ala-ended UDP-MurNac-pentapeptides (9%) were still detected in the cytoplasm of the NZ3900-derivative expressing ddlLp and VanXA (NZ3900 (pGIM024), Table 1), but they were totally undetectable in the strain co-expressing ddlLp and aad (NZ3900 (pGIM023)) and in the ddlLc mutant derivatives MD003 and MD004 (Table 1). This shows that the Aad dipeptidase of L. plantarum is at least as efficient as the enterococcal VanX dipeptidase in reorienting the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan precursors when expressed in a heterologous"
