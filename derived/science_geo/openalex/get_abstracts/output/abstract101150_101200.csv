https://openalex.org/W2110534885,"Recording of glutamate-activated currents in membrane patches was combined with RT-PCR-mediated AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit mRNA analysis in single identified cells of rat brain slices. Analysis of AMPARs in principal neurons and interneurons of hippocampus and neocortex and in auditory relay neurons and Bergmann glial cells indicates that the GluR-B subunit in its flip version determines formation of receptors with relatively slow gating, whereas the GluR-D subunit promotes assembly of more rapidly gated receptors. The relation between Ca2+ permeability of AMPAR channels and the relative GluR-B mRNA abundance is consistent with the dominance of this subunit in determining the Ca2+ permeability of native receptors. The results suggest that differential expression of GluR-B and GluR-D subunit genes, as well as splicing and editing of their mRNAs, account for the differences in gating and Ca2+ permeability of native AMPAR channels."
https://openalex.org/W2088732289,"An insertional mutagenesis system that uses transposons carrying unique DNA sequence tags was developed for the isolation of bacterial virulence genes. The tags from a mixed population of bacterial mutants representing the inoculum and bacteria recovered from infected hosts were detected by amplification, radiolabeling, and hybridization analysis. When applied to a murine model of typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhimurium, mutants with attenuated virulence were revealed by use of tags that were present in the inoculum but not in bacteria recovered from infected mice. This approach resulted in the identification of new virulence genes, some of which are related to, but functionally distinct from, the inv/spa family of S. typhimurium."
https://openalex.org/W2002282120,"The ternary complex factor (TCF) subfamily of ETS-domain transcription factors bind with serum response factor (SRF) to the serum response element (SRE) and mediate increased gene expression. The TCF protein Elk-1 is phosphorylated by the JNK and ERK groups of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases causing increased DNA binding, ternary complex formation, and transcriptional activation. Activated SRE-dependent gene expression is induced by JNK in cells treated with interleukin-1 and by ERK after treatment with phorbol ester. The Elk-1 transcription factor therefore integrates MAP kinase signaling pathways in vivo to coordinate biological responses to different extracellular stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2002644780,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the gene encoding huntingtin, a protein of unknown function. To distinguish between ""loss of function"" and ""gain of function"" models of HD, the murine HD homolog Hdh was inactivated by gene targeting. Mice heterozygous for Hdh inactivation were phenotypically normal, whereas homozygosity resulted in embryonic death. Homozygotes displayed abnormal gastrulation at embryonic day 7.5 and were resorbing by day 8.5. Thus, huntingtin is critical early in embryonic development, before the emergence of the nervous system. That Hdh inactivation does not mimic adult HD neuropathology suggests that the human disease involves a gain of function."
https://openalex.org/W2026904817,"To identify molecules that regulate the transition of dividing neuroblasts to terminally differentiated neurons in the CNS, conditions have been developed that allow the neuronal differentiation of cortical precursor cells to be examined in vitro. In these cultures, the proliferation of undifferentiated precursor cells is controlled by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The proliferative effects of bFGF do not preclude the action of signals that promote differentiation, since addition of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) antagonizes the proliferative effects of bFGF and enhances neuronal differentiation. In addition, blocking NT-3 function with neutralizing antibodies leads to a marked decrease in the number of differentiated neurons, without affecting the proliferation of cortical precursors or the survival of postmitotic cortical neurons. These observations suggest that bFGF and NT-3, by their distinct effects on cell proliferation and differentiation, are key regulators of neurogenesis in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1970642341,"Midbrain dopaminergic neurons, whose loss in adults results in Parkinson's disease, can be specified during embryonic development by a contact-dependent signal from floor plate cells. Here we show that the amino-terminal product of Sonic hedgehog autoproteolysis (SHH-N), an inductive signal expressed by floor plate cells, can induce dopaminergic neurons in vitro. We show further that manipulations to increase the activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A, which is known to antagonize hedgehog signaling, can block dopaminergic neuron induction by floor plate cells. Our results and those of other studies indicate that SHH-N can function in a dose-dependent manner to induce different cell types within the neural tube. Our results also provide the basis for a potential cell transplantation therapy for Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1990500865,"The mechanisms that regulate regional specification and evolution of the cerebral cortex are obscure. To this end, we have identified and characterized a novel murine and human gene encoding a putative transcription factor related to the Brachyury (T) gene that is expressed only in postmitotic cells. T-brain-1 (Tbr-1) mRNA is largely restricted to the cerebral cortex, where during embryogenesis it distinguishes domains that we propose may give rise to paleocortex, limbic cortex, and neocortex. Tbr-1 and Id-2 expression in the neocortex have discontinuities that define molecularly distinct neocortical areas. Tbr-1 expression is analyzed in the context of the prosomeric model. Topological maps are proposed for the organization of the dorsal telencephalon."
https://openalex.org/W2076539319,"The folding and unfolding of a three-helix bundle protein were explored with molecular-dynamics simulations, cluster analysis, and weighted-histogram techniques. The folding-unfolding process occurs by means of a ""folding funnel,"" in which a uniform and broad distribution of conformational states is accessible outside of the native manifold. This distribution narrows near a transition region and becomes compact within the native manifold. Key thermodynamic steps in folding include initial interactions around the amino-terminal helix-turn-helix motif, interactions between helices I and II, and, finally, the docking of helix III onto the helix I-II subdomain. A metastable minimum in the calculated free-energy surface is observed at approximately 1.5 times the native volume. Folding-unfolding thermodynamics are dominated by the opposing influences of protein-solvent energy, which favors unfolding, and the overall entropy, which favors folding by means of the hydrophobic effect."
https://openalex.org/W2098021908,"Seven families of RNA ligases, previously isolated from random RNA sequences, fall into three classes on the basis of secondary structure and regiospecificity of ligation. Two of the three classes of ribozymes have been engineered to act as true enzymes, catalyzing the multiple-turnover transformation of substrates into products. The most complex of these ribozymes has a minimal catalytic domain of 93 nucleotides. An optimized version of this ribozyme has a kcat exceeding one per second, a value far greater than that of most natural RNA catalysts and approaching that of comparable protein enzymes. The fact that such a large and complex ligase emerged from a very limited sampling of sequence space implies the existence of a large number of distinct RNA structures of equivalent complexity and activity."
https://openalex.org/W2057610250,"The mutation R1448C substitutes a cysteine for the outermost arginine in the fourth transmembrane segment (S4) of domain 4 in skeletal muscle sodium channels. We tested the accessibility of this cysteine residue to hydrophilic methanethiosulfonate reagents applied to the extracellular surface of cells expressing these mutant channels. The reagents irreversibly increase the rate of inactivation of R1448C, but not wild-type, channels. Cysteine modification is voltage dependent, as if depolarization extends this residue into the extracellular space. The rate of cysteine modification increases with depolarization and has the voltage dependence and kinetics expected for the movement of a voltage sensor controlling channel gating."
https://openalex.org/W1988519721,"Phylogenetically conserved brain centers known as mushroom bodies are implicated in insect associative learning and in several other aspects of insect behavior. Kenyon cells, the intrinsic neurons of mushroom bodies, have been generally considered to be disposed as homogenous arrays. Such a simple picture imposes constraints on interpreting the diverse behavioral and computational properties that mushroom bodies are supposed to perform. Using a P[GAL4] enhancer-trap approach, we have revealed axonal processes corresponding to intrinsic cells of the Drosophila mushroom bodies. Rather than being homogenous, we find the Drosophila mushroom bodies to be compound neuropils in which parallel subcomponents exhibit discrete patterns of gene expression. Different patterns correspond to hitherto unobserved differences in Kenyon cell trajectory and placement. On the basis of this unexpected complexity, we propose a model for mushroom body function in which parallel channels of information flow, perhaps with different computational properties, subserve different behavioral roles."
https://openalex.org/W2089483927,"Hypochlorous acid is the major strong oxidant generated by human neutrophils, and it has the potential to cause much of the tissue damage that these inflammatory cells promote. It is produced from hydrogen peroxide and chloride by the heme enzyme myeloperoxidase. To unequivocally establish that hypochlorous acid contributes to inflammation, a stable and unique marker for its reaction with biomolecules needs to be identified. In this investigation we have found that reagent hypochlorous acid reacts with tyrosyl residues in small peptides and converts them to chlorotyrosine. Purified myeloperoxidase in combination with hydrogen peroxide and chloride, as well as stimulated human neutrophils, chlorinated tyrosine in the peptide Gly-Gly-Tyr-Arg. Rather than reacting directly with the aromatic ring of tyrosine, hypochlorous acid initially reacted with an amine group of the peptide to form a chloramine. The chloramine then underwent an intramolecular reaction with the tyrosyl residue to convert it to chlorotyrosine. This indicates that tyrosyl residues in proteins that are close to amine groups will be susceptible to chlorination. Peroxidases are the only enzymes capable of chlorinating an aromatic ring. Furthermore, myeloperoxidase is the only human enzyme that produces hypochlorous acid under physiological conditions. Therefore, chlorotyrosine will be a specific marker for the production of hypochlorous acid <i>in vivo</i> and for the involvement of myeloperoxidase in inflammatory tissue damage."
https://openalex.org/W2007261940,Restrictions in neuronal fate occur during the transition from a multipotential to a postmitotic cell. This and later steps in neuronal differentiation are determined by extracellular signals. We report that basic fibroblast growth factor is mitogenic for stem cells and is a differentiation factor for calbindin-expressing hippocampal neurons. The neurotrophin NT-3 is a differentiation factor for the same neurons but does not affect proliferation. NT-3 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor promote the maturation of neurons derived from stem cells that have been grown in vitro. These results define functions for basic fibroblast growth factor and neurotrophins in the differentiation processes that direct a multipotential stem cell to a specific neuronal fate.

Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of superoxide dismutase, an O scavenger, on NO-mediated cytotoxicity suggest that ONOO- may contribute to the NO-mediated biological effects(7Skaper S.D. Facci L.

Recently, nitric oxide has been reported to mediate apoptosis in murine macrophages, and activated murine macrophages can induce apoptosis in tumor cells through a NO-dependent or independent mechanism(14Albina J.E.

Macrophages, neutrophils, and endothelial cells have the ability to generate both NO and superoxide, from which peroxynitrite can be formed in large amounts(2Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Chen J. Tsai M.

Although NO has been reported to be involved in the process of apoptosis(14Albina J.E. Cui S. Mateo R.B. Reichner J.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5080-5085PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cui S. Reichner J.S.

In this communication we demonstrate, for the first time, that peroxynitrite can induce apoptosis in two transformed cell lines, i.e. HL-60 and U-937, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner but fails to have any effect on normal endothelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells under the conditions utilized. nitric oxide peroxynitrite superoxide human peripheral blood mononuclear cell human umbilical vein endothelial cell phosphate-buffered saline propidium iodide. The human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell line and human monocytic tumor cell line U-937 were purchased from ATCC and maintained at 0.2-1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics/antimycotics (Sigma). Cells were maintained in a culture incubator at 37°C under a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere and were used for experiments during the exponential phase of growth. Cell counts were performed routinely to maintain low population density and were assayed for viability by their ability to exclude trypan blue dye. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained and cultured in M-199 medium with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described(16Wong P.Y-K. Yan Y.T. Lin K.T. Shen S.Y. Falck J.R. Atheroscler. Rev. 1993; 25: 101-109Google Scholar). Cell apoptosis assays were performed on second passage endothelial cells. Endothelial cells were maintained at confluence for 2-3 days prior to experiments. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were recovered from heparin-anticoagulated blood of healthy volunteers by centrifugation of mixed blood sample with Ficoll-Paque plus (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Freshly isolated PBMC were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before experiments. Cells were kept in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics/antimycotics and were maintained in a culture incubator after experimental treatments. Peroxynitrite was prepared by the reaction of 1 eq of H2O2 with 1 eq of 2-methoxyethyl nitrite (17Becker H. Berger W. Domschke G. Fanghanel E. Faust J. Fischer M. Gentz F. Gewald K. Gluch R. Mayer R. Muller K. Pavel D. Schmidt H. Schollberg K. Schwetlick K. Seiler E. Zeppenfeld G. Organicum. 15 Ed. VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenchaften, Berlin1977: 657Google Scholar) under basic conditions as described(18Leis J.R. Pena M.E. Rios A. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; : 1298-1299Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 ml of 160 mM peroxynitrite was prepared by adding 1.5 ml of H2O2 (0.1 M) to 1.5 ml of 2 N sodium hydroxide and diluted with 7 ml of distilled H2O. To this solution 0.15 ml (1.6 mM) of 2-methoxyethyl nitrite was added at room temperature. The UV spectrum of the solution after 15 min showed a quantitative formation of peroxynitrite after all H2O2 and nitrite were consumed (λmax = 302 nm; c = 1670 ± 50 liters/mol cm). The light yellow solution of peroxynitrite (150-200 mM) can be stored at −80°C for an extended time. Aliquots of peroxynitrite were monitored spectroscopically at 302 nm to accurately determine the concentration before and after each experiment. In order to avoid any possible indirect effects to the cells resulting from interaction of ONOO- with components of cell medium and to prolong the half-life of ONOO-, a Tris-PBS pH 8.7 (50 mM Tris, pH 8.7, D-PBS without Ca2+) buffer system was used. It did not adversely affect the growth of the cells used in this study. Cells were suspended in this Tris-PBS buffer rather than in cell medium when treated with ONOO-. This Tris-PBS buffer also served to offset any increase in pH caused by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 N NaOH used as the vehicle, which might have damaged the cells resulting in an artifactual apoptosis. HL-60 cells, U-937 cells, and PBMCs were centrifuged, washed twice with PBS (Ca2+/Mg2+ free), and resuspended in 5 ml of Tris-PBS (1 × 106 cells/ml). Various stock concentrations of ONOO- were freshly prepared in 0.5 N NaOH. Five microliters of each stock were added to separate cell suspensions and incubated for 10 min at 37°C. The cells were washed, centrifuged, resuspended in culture medium, and maintained in a culture incubator for the additional time required for each experiment. Five microliters of Tris-PBS buffer and 0.5 N NaOH were used in the control and vehicle, respectively. Cell density and viability were examined by trypan blue exclusion. In endothelial cells, 2.5 μl of various concentrations of ONOO- and 0.5 N NaOH were added into 2.5 ml of Tris-PBS buffer under the same experimental conditions mentioned above. Cells for morphological examination were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 1 ml of cold 70% ethanol at 4°C for 60 min, centrifuged, washed again, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. RNase (type I-A, Sigma, 250 μg/ml) was added, followed by propidium iodide (PI, Sigma, 25 μg/ml)(19Nicoletti I. Migliorati M. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). After 15 min in the dark at 25°C, the cells were photographed under an Olympus IMT2-RFL fluorescence microscope. The extent of DNA fragmentation was determined by a modified method of Sellins and Cohen (20Sellins K.S. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3199-3206PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were harvested and washed at the indicated time by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min. The pellet was lysed with 0.5 ml of hypotonic lysing buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100), and the lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min to separate intact and fragmented chromatin. Both pellet and supernatant were precipitated overnight at 4°C with 12.5% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were sedimented at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The DNA precipitate was heated to 90°C for 10 min in 80 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid and was quantitated by diphenylamine reactions(21Burton K. Biochem. J. 1956; 62: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (10853) Google Scholar). The percentage of fragmentation was calculated as the ratio of DNA in the supernatants to the total DNA. At each time point, cells were harvested and washed, and the DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1)(22Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9167) Google Scholar). The effect of ONOO- on DNA fragmentation was examined by gel electrophoresis as described(19Nicoletti I. Migliorati M. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 100 μg/ml proteinase K, 1% SDS) and incubated at 37°C; proteinase K was added every few hours until the mixture became clear. The DNA was extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform, precipitated overnight in −20°C ethanol containing 0.3 M final concentration of sodium acetate (pH 5.2), and centrifuged for 30 min, 4°C, at 13,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). RNase (100 μg/ml) was added to each sample and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The DNA samples were mixed with loading buffer and loaded onto a 1% agarose gel. A HindIII digest of λ-DNA was applied to each gel to provide molecular size markers of 23.5, 9.6, 6.6, 4.3, 2.2, 2.1, and 0.5 kilobase pairs. Electrophoresis was carried out in TBE buffer (2 mM EDTA, 89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid), and the DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining and photographed on Polaroid type 667 (3000 ASA) film. Treatment with various concentrations of peroxynitrite resulted in a time-dependent decrease in cell density of HL-60 cells (Fig. 1). Control and vehicle-treated cells demonstrated a normal growth pattern. However, cells treated with peroxynitrite resulted in a concentration-dependent loss of cell density at an effective concentration of 10 μM. Cell viability was the same in the control, vehicle, and treated groups up to 6 h as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Morphological changes (blebbing and shrinkage) were detected 3 h after treatment with 10 μM peroxynitrite (data not shown), and the time-dependent decrease in cell density was clearly distinct at 12 h. In order to investigate whether this phenomenon was caused by apoptosis, HL-60 cells treated with 10 μM ONOO- were harvested at different times. Apoptosis of HL-60 cells was recognized by a characteristic alteration in cell morphology and the appearance of DNA fragments equivalent to approximately 200 base pairs and multiples thereof (Fig. 2A and Fig. 4C). A ladder pattern of the DNA fragmentation, as detected by electrophoresis, appeared as early as 3 h after cells were exposed to peroxynitrite (Fig. 2A, lane 4) and was time-dependent. However, no ladder pattern was observed, under identical conditions, in the control and vehicle-treated groups even after 5 h (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). Alternatively, HL-60 cells incubated with sodium azide (0.1%), a substance that induces cell death through a non-apoptotic mechanism(23Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D. J. Pathol. 1984; 142: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar), showed no apoptotic ladder pattern (Fig. 2A, lane 6). To further characterize this phenomenon, various concentrations of peroxynitrite, up to 100 μM, were added, and cells were harvested 5 h after exposure to peroxynitrite. The apoptotic ladder DNA bands were clearly detected at 10 μM and higher concentrations (Fig. 2B, lanes 4-6), whereas neither control, nor vehicle, nor 1 μM peroxynitrite demonstrated any of the characteristic ladder pattern (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-3). This concentration-dependent response to peroxynitrite was also quantitated by colorimetric DNA fragmentation assay, as shown in Fig. 3, and further substantiated by the morphological changes (Fig. 4). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” propidium iodide was used to assess changes in cell morphology. We observed that 5 h after the initial 10-min exposure to peroxynitrite, there was chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 4, compare C and D with A and B). A number of intact cell fragments (apoptotic bodies), which are small membrane-bound bodies containing fragments of highly condensed DNA, appeared after 100 μM ONOO- treatment (Fig. 4D). Plasma membrane integrity, however, was intact for several hours following the initial changes in chromatin appearance. To ascertain that this apoptotic process is induced by peroxynitrite and not by its decomposed products, supernatant from each incubation was collected and incubated with freshly prepared HL-60 cells. No apoptotic ladder of DNA fragmentation was detected from those cells exposed to pretreated supernatant previously containing up to 100 μM ONOO- (data not shown). The apoptotic process induced by peroxynitrite was not blocked but, actually, enhanced by the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) (Fig. 2B, lane 7). Induction of apoptosis was also observed in U-937 cells exposed to different concentrations of peroxynitrite (Fig. 2C). However, the response to peroxynitrite in U-937 cells was slightly weaker than that of HL-60 cells. This was evident by a lower percentage of DNA fragmentation (data not shown). Unlike HL-60 cells, U-937 cells were not affected by 10 μM ONOO- (Fig. 2C, lane 4), but at higher concentrations (50 μM and 100 μM), the ladder pattern of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 6) as well as chromatin condensation was observed (data not shown). These results suggested that apoptosis of transformed leukemia cells can be effectively induced with micromolar concentrations of peroxynitrite.Figure 2:Time and dose-dependent effects of ONOO- on DNA fragmentation. A, agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA extracted from HL-60 cells 1 h (lane 3), 3 h (lane 4), and 5 h (lane 5) after cells were exposed to 10 μM ONOO- as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both control (lane 1) and vehicle (lane 2) experiments were carried out under the same conditions for 5 h. 0.1% sodium azide was added to the HL-60 cells culture medium for 5 h of incubation as a negative control. No DNA fragments were seen in sodium azide-treated HL-60 cells (lane 6). B, HL-60 cells were exposed to various concentrations of ONOO- and were harvested 5 h after treatment as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lanes 1-6 are: control, vehicle, 1 μM, 10 μM, 50 μM, 100 μM, respectively. Cycloheximide were added into the cell culture medium (50 μg/ml) 30 min before cells were exposed to 100 μM ONOO- and thereafter coincubated with cells for 5 h (lane 7). Lane 8 is a HindIII digest of λ-DNA providing molecular size markers. C, U-937 cells were exposed to various concentrations of ONOO- under the same conditions as described in B above.

No characteristic apoptotic morphology or ladder pattern was observed after 5 h of peroxynitrite treatment (up to 100 μM) (Fig. 5). Apoptosis is a highly regulated process of cell death and appears to be an essential and critical mechanism used by biological organisms to maintain homeostasis. The loss of the ability by the cell to undergo spontaneous apoptosis rather than increasing cell proliferation rates has been suggested to be one of the mechanisms involved in some tumor malignancies(24Kerr K.M. Lamb D. J. Pathol. 1984; 107: 41-50Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 25Allan D.J. Howell A. Roberts S.A. Williams G.T. Watson R.J. Coyne J.D. Clarke R.B. Laidlaw I.J. Potten C.S. J. Pathol. 1992; 167: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It has been reported that macrophages can induce tumor cell death through nitric oxide-mediated induction of apoptosis (15Cui S. Reichner J.S. Mateo R.B. Albina J.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2462-2467PubMed Google Scholar). NO itself is a relatively weak oxidant; however, when it reacts with O (k = 6.7 × 109M−1 s−1)(26Beckman J.S. Carson M. Smith G.D. Koppenol W.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 584Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), it generates a strong oxidizing agent, peroxynitrite anion. Many NO-mediated cytotoxic effects have been shown to be mediated through the interaction of ONOO- with proteins and membrane lipid (27Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here, for the first time, that ONOO- can induce apoptosis in HL-60 and U-937 cell lines but not in normal HUVECs and PBMCs. Since peroxynitrite can cross the cell membrane and is sufficiently stable for several seconds in the buffer used during the experiment, an more efficient defense mechanism may exist in the two normal cells. However, the exact mechanism still needs further investigations. The cytotoxicity of ONOO- has been suggested to be involved in the initiation of lipid peroxidation(29Rubbo H. Radi R. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Kalyanaraman B. Barnes S. Kirk M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26066-26075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), oxidation of sulfhydryls(1Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and inactivation of enzymes in the mitochondria electron transport chain(30Radi R. Rodriguez M. Castro L. Telleri R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Different from NO, ONOO- has specific abilities to cause tyrosine nitration and, thus, alter the protein activities(2Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Chen J. Tsai M. Martin J.C. Smith C.D. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar, 31Haddad I.Y. Crow J.P. Hu P. Ye Y. Beckman J. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L242-L249PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation, a critical modification in cellular signal transduction, is an integral aspect of cellular growth and transformation(32Yarden Y. Ullrich A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 443-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). It has been shown that nitration of tyrosine will inhibit the phosphorylation of the nitrated tyrosine molecule(33Martin B.L. Wu D. Jakes S. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7108-7111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the disruption of the signal transduction cascade resulting from the nitration of tyrosine residues may be a critical pathological event caused by peroxynitrite. However, the exact mechanism of ONOO- to elicit the apoptotic effect on transformed cells remains to be established. In addition, the observation that the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, failed to inhibit HL-60 cell apoptosis after induction by ONOO- suggests that new protein synthesis may not be required for the ONOO--induced apoptotic response. Whether or not modification of certain functional residues of the proteins by peroxynitrite contributes to this apoptotic effect is now under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2083956045,Transmission of auditory information from the medial geniculate body to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is believed to be involved in the conditioning of fear responses to acoustic stimuli. This pathway exhibits LTP of electrically evoked field potentials after high frequency stimulation of the medial geniculate body. High frequency stimulation of the medial geniculate body also results in a long-lasting potentiation of a field potential in the lateral amygdala elicited by a naturally transduced acoustic stimulus. This demonstrates that natural information processing can make use of the physiological mechanisms set in motion by LTP induction.

The telomerase activities of the yeasts Saccharomyces castellii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae--with regular and irregular telomeric sequences, respectively--have now been identified and characterized. The S. cerevisiae activity required the telomerase RNA gene TLC1 but not the EST1 gene, both of which are required for normal telomere maintenance in vivo. This activity exhibited low processivity and produced no regularly repeated products. An inherently high stalling frequency of the S. cerevisiae telomerase may account for its in vitro properties and for the irregular telomeric sequences of this yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2032733145,"In five members of a family and another unrelated person affected by a slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (SCCMS), molecular genetic analysis of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunit genes revealed a heterozygous G to A mutation at nucleotide 457 of the alpha subunit, converting codon 153 from glycine to serine (alpha G153S). Electrophysiologic analysis of SCCMS end plates revealed prolonged decay of miniature end plate currents and prolonged activation episodes of single AChR channels. Engineered mutant AChR expressed in HEK fibroblasts exhibited prolonged activation episodes strikingly similar to those observed at the SCCMS end plates. Single-channel kinetic analysis of engineered alpha G153S AChR revealed a markedly decreased rate of ACh dissociation, which causes the mutant AChR to open repeatedly during ACh occupancy. In addition, ACh binding measurements combined with the kinetic analysis indicated increased desensitization of the mutant AChR. Thus, ACh binding affinity can dictate the time course of the synaptic response, and alpha G153 contributes to the low binding affinity for ACh needed to speed the decay of the synaptic response."
https://openalex.org/W2103944414,"The 43 kDa AChR-associated protein rapsyn is required for the clustering of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the developing neuromuscular junction, but the functions of other postsynaptic proteins colocalized with the AChR are less clear. Here we use a fibroblast expression system to investigate the role of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) in AChR clustering. The agrin-binding component of the DGC, dystroglycan, is found evenly distributed across the cell surface when expressed in fibroblasts. However, dystroglycan colocalizes with AChR-rapsyn clusters when these proteins are coexpressed. Furthermore, dystroglycan colocalizes with rapsyn clusters even in the absence of AChR, indicating that rapsyn can cluster dystroglycan and AChR independently. Immunofluorescence staining using a polyclonal antibody to utrophin reveals a lack of staining of clusters, suggesting that the immunoreactive species, like the AChR, does not mediate the observed rapsyndystroglycan interaction. Rapsyn may therefore be a molecular link connecting the AChR to the DGC. At the neuromuscular synapse, rapsyn-mediated linkage of the AChR to the cytoskeleton-anchored DGC may underlie AChR cluster stabilization."

Yeast contain a homologue of karyopherin α named Srp1p, which was initially identified as a genetic suppressor of mutations in a subunit of RNA polymerase I. To determine whether yeast contain a karyopherin complex that includes Srp1p as the karyopherin α homologue, we genetically replaced Srp1p with a Srp1-Protein A chimera. Cytosol from this strain contained a complex, composed of the chimera and a protein of 95 kDa, that was purified using affinity chromatography on IgG Sepharose. Microsequence analysis showed that the 95-kDa protein was identical with a yeast protein encoded by gene L8300.15 on chromosome XII. Sequence comparison revealed that the L8300.15 gene product is the closest structural homologue of vertebrate karyopherin β. The yeast α and β karyopherin subunits were expressed in Escherichia coli and were purified. When combined, they formed a heterodimeric complex and were active in targeting import substrate to nuclear envelopes of mammalian cells.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, protein import into nuclei was examined in vitro using spheroplasts that were permeabilized by freeze-thaw(17Schlenstedt G. Hurt E. Doye V. Silver P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 785-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast to the mammalian import reaction, docking of import substrate to the yeast nuclear envelope did not require addition of cytosolic proteins(17Schlenstedt G. Hurt E. Doye V. Silver P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 785-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To explain this difference, it was proposed that previously identified NLS receptors of yeast (none of them karyopherin homologues) remain tightly bound to the NPCs of freeze-thawed cells and do not need to be added back(17Schlenstedt G. Hurt E. Doye V. Silver P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 785-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The recent identification of karyopherin in vertebrates and the fact that karyopherin α is homologous to yeast Srp1p (4Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we report that yeast Srp1p is indeed the functional homologue of vertebrate karyopherin α and that it can be isolated from yeast cytosol in a heterodimeric complex with a protein of 95 kDa that is a functional homologue of vertebrate karyopherin β. Yeast karyopherin α and β were expressed separately in Escherichia coli, and each was purified to homogeneity. Recombinant α and β assembled into a heterodimer in vitro and were required in combination for NLS substrate recognition and docking to nuclear envelopes in digitonin-permeabilized mammalian cells. The yeast proteins are therefore termed Kap60p for karyopherin α subunit of 60 kDa and Kap95p for karyopherin β subunit of 95 kDa. The alternate term Kap60p for Srp1p was deemed necessary to avoid further confusion with the previously issued acronym SRP (signal recognition particle) (21Walter P. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7112-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strains used were DF5 (MATa/MATα trp1-1/trp1-1 ura3-52/ura3-52 his3-Δ200/his3-Δ200 leu2-3, 112/leu2-3, 112 lys2-801/lys2-801 gal/gal) (22Finley D. zkaynak E. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) and the DF5-derived strains CEY1 (Mata/Matα KAP60/kap60Δ::URA3), CEY1A (Mata KAP60), and CEY1B (Mat α kap60Δ::URA3, pRS315-Kap60-ProtA). Standard molecular biological and yeast genetic techniques were used(23Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-933PubMed Google Scholar). To construct CEY1, nucleotides −450 to 1950 that contain the SRP1/KAP60 open reading frame (ORF) (19Yano R. Oakes M. Yamaghishi M. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5640-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) were amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by PCR using the primers 5’-ATT GAT CCC TCG AGG TTA ACT TAA TCG ACC G-3’ and 5’-CTA GGA AGA TCT TTC AGC TGT GGA-3’. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and BglII and inserted into XhoI-BamHI-digested pBluescript (Stratagene). The 1.1-kilobase HindIII-EcoRV fragment (nucleotides 149-1255) within the SRP1/KAP60 ORF was replaced by the 1.1-kilobase HindIII-SmaI fragment that contains the URA3 gene from vector pJJ244(24Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The kap60Δ::URA3 deletion allele was transformed as a PvuII fragment into the diploid strain DF5. The replacement of one chromosomal KAP60 copy by the deletion allele in the Ura+ transformant CEY1 was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization. To express Kap60-ProtA in yeast, nucleotides −450 to 1626 that contain the SRP1/KAP60 ORF (19Yano R. Oakes M. Yamaghishi M. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5640-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA using primers that incorporate a XhoI site at the 5’ end and an in-frame BamHI site replacing the stop codon of SRP1/KAP60. The PCR fragment was inserted into XhoI-BamHI-digested CEN6-ARS-LEU2 vector pRS315 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pRS315-Kap60. The segment of the staphylococcal Protein A gene (nucleotides 272-1104) that encodes the five IgG binding domains was amplified from pET8c-pS/protA (26Schnell D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) by PCR using primers that incorporate an in-frame BamHI site at the 5’ end and a stop codon followed by a BamHI site at the 3’ end. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and ligated in pRS315-Kap60 to generate pRS315-Kap60-ProtA, which was used to transform CEY1. Leu+ transformants were selected and sporulated. After tetrad dissection Ura+ Leu+ spores were selected, one of them was named CEY1B. To verify the replacement of the wild-type copy of SRP1/KAP60 by the plasmid-born SRP1/KAP60-ProtA, cell lysates of CEY1B were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and ECL Western blotting (Amersham). Yeast strain CEY1B was grown in 5 liters of YPD medium at 30°C for 16 h to early stationary phase. Cells (80 g) were harvested and converted into spheroplasts as described(27Kalinich J.F. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17979-17989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using only Zymolyase 20T. Spheroplasts were lysed in 300 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF with a Dounce homogenizer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The high speed supernatant (25 mg of protein/ml) was mixed with 3 ml of packed IgG-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that were equilibrated in loading buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM PMSF), and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4°C in batch. Beads were transferred to a column and washed with 30 bed volumes of loading buffer and 2 bed volumes of 5 mM NH4OAc, pH 5.0. Bound proteins were eluted with 10 bed volumes of 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 3.0, and neutralized with 1 M Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4. The eluted 90-kDa protein was processed for microsequence analysis as described(28Fernández J. Andrews L. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). KAP60 and KAP95 genes were amplified separately from yeast genomic DNA by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotides (5’-CCG GGA TCC ATG GAT AAT GGT ACA GAT TCT TCC ACG AGC A-3’ and 5’-CCG GGA TCC TTA ATT GAA TTG TTG GTT GAC ATT AGA ACC A-3’ for KAP60, and 5’-CCG GGA TCC ATG TCC ACC GCT GAA TTT GCT CAA and 5’-CCG GGA TCC TTA TAA GGA TAA TTG ACG CTT CTG TTG-3’ for KAP95) that incorporate a BamHI endonuclease restriction site in-frame with the initiation codon and another after the stop codon of each gene. The purified BamHI fragments were ligated into vector pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to create in-frame fusions with the glutathione S-transferase gene (GST). Plasmids that contained GST-KAP60 and GST-KAP90 gene fusions were introduced into E. coli strain BLR (Novagen). Fusion proteins were purified as follows. Reagents used were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. Cells were grown in 1 liter of 2 × YTA (Difco Laboratories) at 37°C to a cell density of 1-2 A600 units. Cells were shifted to 28°C, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM to induce synthesis of fusion proteins. After 1 h, cells were harvested at 4°C by centrifugation, and cell pellets were resuspended with 18 ml of chilled lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). PMSF and lysozyme were added to final concentrations of 0.5 mM and 1 mg/ml, respectively, and the cell suspension was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Sodium deoxycholate and DNase I were added to final concentrations of 1 mg/ml and 10 μg/ml, respectively, and lysates were incubated again at room temperature for 15 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter (Schleicher and Schuell). The filtrate was mixed with 0.5 ml of packed glutathione-agarose beads that were equilibrated in transport buffer (TB: 20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 110 mM KOAc, 2 mM MgOAc, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol), and the mixture was incubated at 4°C for 1-6 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C and were washed 4 times with 15 ml of TB by repeated resuspension and centrifugation. To elute fusion protein, beads were resuspended in 1 ml of TB with 10 mM reduced glutathione and were incubated for 10 min at 4°C. Pooled eluates (3 ml) contained fusion protein at an average concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. To cleave Kap proteins from GST, thrombin was added to eluates that had been concentrated (1.5 NIH units of thrombin per 100 μg of GST-Kap60p and 3 NIH units per 100 μg of GST-Kap95p), and the mixture was incubated for 10-30 min at room temperature. Samples were chilled, and PMSF was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Proteins in the samples were resolved in a Superdex 200 FPLC sizing column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to yield near-pure Kap proteins in fractions depleted of GST, thrombin, and uncleaved fusion protein. Assays were performed as described previously (4Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 29Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) with a few technical variations that are outlined below. Buffalo rat liver cells were permeabilized in 50 μg/ml digitonin in TB, during a 5-min incubation at room temperature. Cells were then placed on ice and washed twice with chilled TB. Reactions were incubated for 15 min on ice and contained additions as indicated in the figure legends. Completed reactions were washed twice with chilled TB, and cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in TB. Cells were visualized and photographed under a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). To facilitate isolation of yeast Srp1p/Kap60p and to determine whether it, like vertebrate karyopherin α, is associated with a β subunit, we genetically replaced cellular Kap60p with a Kap60p-Protein A chimera that could be easily isolated using IgG-Sepharose chromatography. Immunoblot analysis of wild-type and mutant cell lysates using anti-Srp1p(Kap60p) antibodies (19Yano R. Oakes M. Yamaghishi M. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5640-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) showed that Kap60p was absent in mutant cells (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 2) but was replaced by the Kap60p-Protein A chimera (lane 2). When the same blot was probed with anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase, the chimera (lane 4) but not wild-type Kap60p (lane 3) was detected. The tagging of Kap60p with Protein A allowed its purification from a high-speed supernatant of a cell lysate using IgG Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 1B). Acid elution of tightly bound proteins and subsequent analysis of the eluate by SDS-PAGE showed two major bands in approximately stoichiometric amounts (lane 4). The slower moving polypeptide was the Kap60p-Protein A chimera, as determined by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). To determine the chemical nature of the faster moving protein, we subjected it to microsequence analysis and obtained a peptide (KQFYGQDWVIDYKRTRSGQLFSQATKD) that was identical with the C terminus of a 95-kDa protein of unknown function, encoded by the essential2 gene L8300.15 on yeast chromosome XII (GenBank™ accession number U19028). A protein homology search in GenBank identified rat karyopherin β as the closest structural homologue of the L8300.15 gene product, with 33% identity and 63% similarity (Fig. 2). Because of the high degree of similarity to vertebrate karyopherin β and because of its apparent stoichiometric association with yeast karyopherin α (Kap60p), we termed this protein Kap95p. Taken together the data suggest that yeast, like vertebrate cells, possess a cytosolic karyopherin complex. To determine whether yeast karyopherin functions in targeting import substrate to NPCs, we expressed the two subunits separately in E. coli and purified each to homogeneity. Molecular sieving of isolated Kap60p and Kap95p showed that each migrated as expected for a monomeric globular protein (Fig. 3, A and B). When the two subunits were incubated together at 0°C and the mixture was subjected to molecular sieving, approximately 50% of the subunits assembled into a heterodimeric complex (Fig. 3C). To test whether recombinant yeast karyopherin subunits are competent to target an import substrate to NPCs, we employed a well characterized assay that uses digitonin-permeabilized mammalian cells(29Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Indeed, as previously shown for vertebrate karyopherin subunits(1Adam E.J.H. Adam S.A. J.

A. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), both yeast subunits were required to obtain docking of import substrate at the nuclear envelope (Fig. 4, panel 3). Neither subunit alone was sufficient to obtain docking (panels 1 and 2). Thus, we conclude that Kap60p and Kap95p are the functional homologues of karyopherin in yeast.Figure 4:The Kap60/Kap95 heterodimer promotes docking of import substrates to nuclear envelopes. Nuclear docking assays were performed using digitonin-permeabilized Buffalo rat liver cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All reaction mixtures contained 20 μg/ml fluorescent import substrate (TRITC-labeled human serum albumin with conjugated peptides that contain the NLS of SV40 large T-antigen (29Moore M.S.

Reactions contained 15 μg/ml (250 nM) purified Kap60p, 15 μg/ml (150 nM) purified Kap95p, or both, as indicated. Cells were visualized and photographed under a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. All panels correspond to reactions that were incubated, photographed, and printed under identical conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data presented here demonstrate that yeast Srp1p is the functional homologue of vertebrate karyopherin α and that it is present in yeast cytosol in a heterodimeric complex with a novel 95-kDa protein (Fig. 1). We show the latter to be the functional homologue of vertebrate karyopherin β (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:). We demonstrate that recombinant yeast karyopherin α (Kap60p) and karyopherin β (Kap95p) assemble into a heterodimeric complex in vitro (Fig. 3) and are required in combination to target import substrates to nuclear envelopes of permeabilized mammalian cells (Fig. 4). Based on these data, we propose that yeast karyopherin mediates the docking of import substrate to nuclear envelopes of yeast. Proof awaits the development of a karyopherin-dependent import assay in yeast (see introduction). Vertebrates contain several homologues of karyopherin α(3Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl.

Other yeast homologues of karyopherin α have not been identified, but there appear to be several homologues of karyopherin β.2 2M. Rout, G. Blobel, and J. Aitchison, unpublished results. Two lines of evidence suggest that yeast karyopherin functions as an α/β heterodimer. First, neither Kap60p nor Kap95p displayed docking activity when added alone (Fig. 4, panels 1 and 2); docking was only detected when Kap proteins were mixed prior to a reaction (Fig. 4, panel 3), under conditions that allow the formation of a 180-kDa heterodimer (Fig. 3C) (see below). Second, Kap60 and Kap95 proteins were isolated from yeast cytosol as a heterodimeric complex (Fig. 1). We concluded that yeast karyopherin is a heterodimer based on the expected molecular size of a 1:1 complex (65 + 100 = 165 kDa) (see Fig. 3) and on the equimolar amount of Coomassie Blue stain adsorbed by each subunit in the complex (Fig. 1B and 3C). Our conclusion provides proof of our previous proposal that karyopherins function as α/β heterodimers (3Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 2Görlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Curr.

We believe that Kap60p functions like vertebrate karyopherin α to recognize the NLS substrate(4Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and Kap95p functions like vertebrate karyopherin β (3Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We therefore suspect that the reported genetic and physical interaction between Srp1p and the nucleoporin Nup1p (30Belanger K.D. Kenna M.A. Wei S. Davis L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) is indirectly mediated by Kap95p; indeed, the uncharacterized 95-kDa protein that co-purifies with Nup1 and Srp1 proteins (30Belanger K.D. Kenna M.A. Wei S. Davis L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) is probably Kap95p. Docking of yeast karyopherin to multiple sites on the NPC would explain previous immunofluorescence data that show co-localization of Srp1p and nucleoporins in a punctate pattern on the nuclear surface(19Yano R. Oakes M. Yamaghishi M. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5640-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We recently showed that vertebrate karyopherin α enters the nucleus, whereas karyopherin β remains at the NPC(8Moroianu J. Hijikata M. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). If Kap60p functions in a similar manner in yeast, it would explain the finding that Srp1p is also localized in the nucleoplasm (19Yano R. Oakes M. Yamaghishi M. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5640-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Why was Srp1p/Kap60p detected as a genetic suppressor of mutations in a subunit of RNA polymerase I(19Yano R. Oakes M. Yamaghishi M. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5640-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar)? Although at present there is no obvious answer, it is likely that Kap60p performs a critical step in the assembly of RNA polymerase I by mediating nuclear import of polymerase subunits. We thank Drs. R. Erdmann, E. Johnson, U. Nehrbass, A. Radu, and N. Schülke for help and advice. We thank J.

Science. 1987; 237: 1452-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Moreover, receptor-catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of exogenous proteins, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) (13Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.-J. Aaronson S.A. White M.F. Pierce J.H.

Once phosphorylated, these proteins are felt to function as platforms for assembly of the mitogenic signaling protein complex, which then proceeds following the EGF receptor paradigm. Here we present the surprising observation that, in contrast to the classical EGF receptor paradigm, stimulation of the MAP kinase pathway by the tyrosine kinase IGF1 receptor also requires the participation of Gβγ subunits derived from PT-sensitive G proteins. Like the G protein-coupled receptor-mediated pathway, the IGF1 signal can be blocked by either PT treatment or by an inhibitor of Gβγ subunit-mediated signaling. Thus, mitogenic signals originating from this class of tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors converge with the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway at a point upstream of p21ras activation.

Transient transfection of Rat 1 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, confluent monolayers in 6-well tissue culture plates were incubated at 37°C with a transfection mixture composed of 1 ml of serum-free DMEM containing 1.2 μg of DNA/well and 7 μl of LipofectAMINE. After 2 h, the mixture was aspirated and replaced with 2 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Assays were performed 48 h after transfection. Empty pRK5 vector was added to transfections as needed to keep the total mass of DNA added per well constant within an experiment. Coexpression of the βARK1-CT peptide was confirmed by protein immunoblotting of whole cell detergent lysates using rabbit anti-βARK1 carboxyl terminus serum as described(16Koch W.J. Hawes B.E.

Endogenous IGF1 receptor expression was quantified by equilibrium binding of 125I-IGF1 (DuPont NEN) as described(17Dubler R.E. Whipple J.H. Larner J. Arch. Biochem.

Agonist-stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous p42Mapk (erk2) was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift as described(10Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Pouyssegur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Transfected Rat 1 cells were preincubated overnight in serum-free medium and stimulated for 5 min (IGF1, EGF, and PMA) or 10 min (LPA). Monolayers were washed with ice-cold calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and clarified by centrifugation. Coexpressed p44Ha−Mapk was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using 6.5 μg of 12CA5 antibody and 30 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose. Washed immune complexes were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol) containing 250 μg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP), 20 μM ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 20 min at 30°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 40 μl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer, and 32P-labeled MBP was resolved by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Fig. 1 depicts the effects of PT treatment on the time course of ligand-stimulated phosphorylation of MAP kinase mediated by endogenous receptors in wild-type Rat 1 cells. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), the simplest naturally occurring phospholipid, provoked a transient increase in MAP kinase phosphorylation, which was abolished by PT pretreatment (Fig. 1A). MAP kinase phosphorylation in response to insulin or IGF1 exposure followed a similar time course and was also PT-sensitive (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, MAP kinase phosphorylation stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor, acidic fibroblast growth factor, or EGF (Fig. 1, D-F), each of which is mediated by membrane receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, exhibited a more robust and sustained activation which was not significantly affected by PT treatment. A similar pattern of PT sensitivity was observed in C3H10T1/2 murine fibroblasts. Thus, the responses mediated by tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors apparently segregated into two groups: one PT-sensitive, resembling the Gi-coupled LPA receptor, and one PT-insensitive. Insulin, IGF1, and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) have distinct cell surface receptors, each of which can bind insulin, IGF1, and IGF2 with varying affinity. The receptors can be discriminated based upon the rank order of potency displayed by each agonist. The receptor for IGF2 consists of a single membrane-spanning polypeptide that lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity(19Morgan D.O. Edman J.C. Standring D.N. Fried V.A. Smith M.C. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1987; 329: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). While not considered a mediator of mitogenic signals, the IGF2 receptor can reportedly interact with PT-sensitive G proteins(20Okamoto T. Katada T. Murayama Y. Ui M. Ogata E. Nishimoto I.

Dose-response curves for MAP kinase phosphorylation in Rat 1 cells revealed a rank order of potency IGF1 > IGF2 insulin (data not shown), indicating that the effects of all three agonists were mediated predominantly by IGF1 receptors, as has been previously reported(21van Obberghen-Schilling E.

As shown in Fig. 2A, preincubation of cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein resulted in significant inhibition of both LPA- and IGF1-mediated MAP kinase phosphorylation at concentrations (100 μM) which did not impair EGF- or direct PKC-mediated effects. At higher concentrations (300 μM), EGF-, LPA-, and IGF1-mediated, but not PKC-mediated, MAP kinase phosphorylation was inhibited (data not shown). MAP kinase activation resulting from expression of the constitutively activated mutant p21T24rasras(22Spandidos D.A. Wilkie N.M. Nature. 1984; 310: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) was unaffected by genistein concentrations up to 300 μM,2 2T. van Biesen and R. J. Lefkowitz, unpublished observation. indicating that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitive step lies upstream of p21ras activation. In contrast to the effects of genistein, the potent tyrosine kinase and PKC inhibitor staurosporine nonspecifically inhibited MAP kinase activation by each agent. Fig. 2B depicts the effects of cellular PKC depletion on agonist-induced MAP kinase phosphorylation. Rechallenge with phorbol ester following PKC depletion provoked no increase in MAP kinase phosphorylation. In contrast, the effects of LPA, IGF1, and EGF were not significantly inhibited. These data suggest that stimulation of MAP kinase phosphorylation by the Gi-coupled LPA receptor and the tyrosine kinase IGF1 receptor are qualitatively similar; each is sensitive to inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and is independent of PKC activation. Recently, G protein Gβγ subunits have been implicated in the direct p21ras-dependent activation of MAP kinase mediated by PT-sensitive G protein-coupled receptors including the LPA receptor. Coexpression of Gβ1γ2 subunits in COS-7 cells leads directly to MAP kinase activation(3Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.P. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that cellular expression of a specific Gβγ subunit binding peptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARK1-CT) (23Pitcher J.A.

To determine whether the PT-sensitive phosphorylation of MAP kinase stimulated by the IGF1 receptor was mediated by Gβγ subunits, we studied the effects of IGF1 in a Rat 1 cell line which stably overexpressed the βARK1-CT peptide (277 cells)(10Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, compared with the parental Rat 1 cells, LPA-stimulated MAP kinase phosphorylation was attenuated by about 50% (Fig. 3A). IGF1-stimulated phosphorylation was undetectable in the 277 cells (Fig. 3B), while the EGF signal was unaffected (Fig. 3C). Thus, sensitivity to inhibition by PT and a Gβγ subunit-binding peptide are properties shared by the LPA- and IGF1-mediated pathways. To confirm that the inhibition of MAP kinase phosphorylation by the Gβγ subunit antagonist reflected impaired kinase activation, MAP kinase activity was determined in Rat 1 cells transiently cotransfected with a peptide minigene encoding the βARK1-CT peptide and hemagglutinin-tagged p44Ha−Mapk (18Meloche S. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Kinase activity of immunoprecipitated p44Ha−Mapk following stimulation was determined to assess MAP kinase activation in the transfected cell pool. As shown in Fig. 4A, results of the p44Ha−Mapk kinase assay resembled the findings in 277 cells. LPA and IGF1 receptor-mediated MAP kinase activation was significantly attenuated both by PT treatment and by expression of the βARK1-CT peptide; the EGF receptor signal, as well as that produced by direct activation of PKC, was not affected. The pathways of both Gi-coupled receptor- and EGF receptor-mediated mitogenesis can also be discriminated from the PKC-dependent pathway based upon their dependence upon activation of p21ras GTP-exchange. As shown in Fig. 4B, transient coexpression of the dominant negative mutant p21N17rasras in Rat 1 cells resulted in inhibition of LPA, IGF1, and EGF receptor-stimulated p44Ha−Mapk activity, with no significant effect upon phorbol ester-induced activation. We have characterized the activation of MAP kinase by tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors, Gi-coupled receptors, and phorbol ester in wild-type and mutant Rat 1 fibroblasts. The data suggest that two tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors, those for EGF and IGF1, employ distinct mechanisms of MAP kinase activation. Unlike the well described EGF receptor pathway, activation of MAP kinase by the IGF1 receptor proceeds via a Gβγ subunit-dependent activation of p21ras. This pathway has previously been implicated only in MAP kinase activation mediated by classical Gi-coupled receptors. Insulin and IGF1 receptor-mediated p21ras activation follows the formation of a protein complex involving the growth factor receptor-binding protein, GRB2, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos1, and tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc or IRS-1(13Wang L.M.

Recently, however, the Gi-coupled receptors for thyrotropin-releasing factor (9Omichi M. Sawada T. Kanda Y. Koike K. Hirota K. Miyake A. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3783-3788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and endothelin 1 (26Cazaubon S.M. Ramos-Morales F. Fischer S. Schweighoffer F. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.-O. J. Biol.

Pouyssegur J. Courtneidge S.A. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 27372-27377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations, along with the data presented here, suggest that G protein-coupled receptors and some tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors may share a common pathway of mitogenic signal transduction. Interaction between Gβγ subunits and the carboxyl terminus of βARK is responsible for agonist-induced translocation of the kinase from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where it initiates the process of homologous desensitization(23Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 24Inglese J. Koch W.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that a similar Gβγ subunit-mediated protein translocation or localization event, involving some component of the mitogenic signaling complex, facilitates transmission of receptor signals to p21ras and MAP kinase. The Gβγ subunit-binding carboxyl terminus of βARK contains a region of protein sequence homology, termed a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (28Mayer B.J. Ren R. Clark K.L. Baltimore D. Cell. 1993; 73: 629-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 29Shaw G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which is also shared by several proteins which participate in the regulation of p21ras. In vitro binding of Gβγ subunits to PH domain-containing peptides derived from several of these proteins, including Ras-GRF, Ras-GAP, IRS-1(30Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the Bruton tyrosine kinase(31Tsukada S. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Katz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11256-11260Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), has been reported. Thus, noncovalent interactions between Gβγ subunits and the PH domains of one or more proteins involved in the regulation of p21ras may provide the structural basis for Gβγ subunit-mediated activation of the MAP kinase pathway. In this regard, it is noteworthy that in transfected Rat 1 cells which stably overexpress human insulin receptors at high density, we have found that insulin treatment provokes a more robust and sustained phosphorylation of MAP kinase which, like the EGF receptor signal, is insensitive to PT treatment or βARK1-CT peptide expression (data not shown). This may reflect an ability of insulin receptors at high density to utilize another, Gβγ subunit-independent pathway. Alternatively, it may indicate that Gβγ subunits are required for efficient signal transduction at low endogenous levels of receptor expression, but that high receptor density surmounts the requirement for a Gβγ subunit-directed protein localization event. Previous work has suggested that in certain cell types, PT-sensitive G proteins may play a role in several aspects of insulin receptor signaling(32Goren H.J. Northrup J.K. Hollenberg M.D. Can. J.

The mechanism whereby the insulin or IGF1 receptor might promote the generation of free Gβγ subunits is unclear, although indirect evidence suggests that a direct protein-protein interaction may occur between receptor and G protein (36Krupinski J.

Recently, peptides derived from the insulin receptor β subunit have been shown to directly activate Gi in phospholipid vesicles(40Okamoto T. Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Hayashi Y. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The data in this report suggest that at endogenous levels of receptor expression, the tyrosine kinase IGF1 receptor and Gi-coupled LPA receptor each require both tyrosine phosphorylation and the release of Gβγ subunits for MAP kinase activation. Understanding how mitogenic signals generated by these divergent classes of membrane receptor interact may be of central importance to the development of strategies to modulate cellular proliferative responses to injury such as those mediated by platelet-derived mitogens that bind to G protein-coupled receptors or the accelerated microvascular and macrovascular disease associated with hyperinsulinemia in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Although herbimycin A is widely used as a tool for inhibiting multiple tyrosine protein kinases and tyrosine kinase-activated signal transduction, its mechanism of action is not well defined and includes a decrease in both tyrosine kinase protein levels and activity (Uehara, Y., Murakami, Y., Sugimoto, Y., and Mizuno, S.(1989) Cancer Res. 49, 780-785). We now show that herbimycin A induces a profound decrease in the total cellular activity of transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors, such as insulin-like growth factor, insulin, and epidermal growth factor receptors. A substantial proportion of the in vivo inhibition could be explained by an increase in the rate of degradation. The enhanced degradation of insulin-like growth factor-insulin receptor was prevented by inhibitors of the 20S proteasome, whereas neither lysosomotropic agents nor general serine- and cysteine-protease inhibitors were active in preventing receptor degradation induced by herbimycin A. Moreover, in a temperature-sensitive mutant cell line defective in the E1-catalyzed activation of ubiquitin, herbimycin A treatment at the restrictive temperature did not result in the degradation of insulin receptor. These results suggest that herbimycin A represents a novel class of drug that targets the degradation of tyrosine kinases by the 20S proteasome. The ubiquitin dependence of this process indicates that this degradation of tyrosine kinases might involve the 20S proteasome as the proteolytic core of the ubiquitin-dependent 26S protease.

The establishment of autocrine and paracrine growth factor loops may play an important role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Insulin-like growth factors and transforming growth factor-α are potent mitogens for breast cancer cells, and tyrosine kinase receptors such as IGF-IR, EGFR, and erbB-2 are overexpressed in a significant percentage of tumors(12Papa V. Gliozzo B. Clark G.M. McGuire W.L. Moore D. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Vigneri R. Goldfine I.D. Pezzino V. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3736-3740PubMed Google Scholar, 13Van de Vijver M.J. Nusse R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 33-50PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, several breast cancer cell lines are dependent on the activity of growth factor receptors for the maintenance of their transformed state(14Arteaga C.L. Coronado E. Osborne C.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Arteaga C.L. Kitten L.J. Coronado E.B. Jacobs S. Kull J.F.C. Alfred D.C. Osborne C.K. J. Clin.

Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1830-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, these tyrosine kinase receptors are potential targets for inhibitors such as HA. We have found that the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA MB-468 (which express high levels of IGF-IR and EGFR, respectively) are profoundly inhibited by HA with respect to anchorage-dependent and -independent growth. In the present study we investigated the mechanism of HA-mediated inhibition of tyrosine kinase receptor action in these cell lines. HA treatment effectively inhibited ligand-induced receptor activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream targets. In vitro kinase activity of the activated receptors was inhibited by HA only slightly and required higher concentrations than those required for the intracellular effect. We have found that in the cell, HA induces a rapid decline in the level of tyrosine kinases without affecting the steady-state levels of other cellular proteins. The decrease in intracellular tyrosine kinase protein content is secondary to induction by the drug of an increased rate of degradation. The enhanced degradation of tyrosine kinases was found to be dependent on the 20S proteasome and the ubiquitin-conjugating pathway. Inhibitors of 20S proteasome proteolytic activities prevented the HA effect. Thus, HA leads to inhibition of transmembrane tyrosine kinases by causing their selective degradation in a process requiring the 20S proteasome, presumably as the catalytic core of the ATP- and ubiquitin-dependent 26S protease.

The following 20S proteasome inhibitors were employed in this study Table I: Bz-Gly-Pro-Ala-phenylalaninal (GPAF-al), Bz-Pro-Gly-Ala-leucinal (PGAL-al), Bz-Gly-Pro-Phe-valinal (GPFV-al), Bz-Gly-Pro-Ala-leucinal (GPAL-al or 2al), Bz-Gly-Pro-Phe-leucinal (GPFL-al or 1al), Bz-Gly-Ala-Phe-leucinal (GAFL-al or 4al), and Bz-Gly-Leu-Ala-leucinal (GLAL-al or 5al). All inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO at 2 mM and stored at −20°C. In order to extend the half-life of these inhibitors in vivo, cultures were simultaneously treated with Bz-Pro-prolinal (PP-al), a peptidyl aldehyde inhibitor of prolyl endopeptidase(20Wilk S. Orlowski M. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), leupeptin, E64d, and calpain inhibitor II were from Sigma and Calbiochem.Table I:20S proteasome inhibitorsStandard one or three letters abbreviations for amino acids are used.

The human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA MB-468 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD. Cultures were maintained in DME/F12 (1:1) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts), 2 mM glutamine, and 50 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, in a humidified 5% CO2/air atmosphere at 37°C. The temperature-sensitive E1-ts20 mutant cell line was provided by Dr. R. Kulka (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem). Cultures were maintained at 32°C in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. ts20 cells were co-transfected with a vector for human insulin receptor under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV-hIR(21Russell D.S. Gherzi R. Johnson E.L. Chou C.K. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11833-11840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and a vector that confers geneticin resistance (pSV-neo). Transfection was performed with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Pooled populations of stable transfectants were selected after 2 weeks of exposure to geneticin (0.5 mg/ml) and maintained under selective pressure. Following experimental treatments, monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then either dissolved directly into SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer or solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3V04, 40 mM NaF, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor) (750 μl/100 mm-dish)(22Sepp-Lorenzino L. Rosen N. Lebwohl D.E. Cell Growth & Diff. 1994; 5: 1077-1083PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C in a microfuge (Eppendorf), and the detergent solubilized proteins were immuno-precipitated with appropriate antibodies. Immunocomplexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia), washed three times with lysis buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and subjected to immunoblotting and detection via chemoluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). IGF-IR immunoprecipitates from insulin-treated cells were washed twice in lysis buffer followed by a wash in lysis buffer lacking phosphatase inhibitors (NaF and Na3VO4). Washed immunoprecipitates were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either herbimycin A or Me2SO in 40 μl of kinase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MnCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) in the presence or absence of 1 mM DTT. In vitro kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/reaction plus unlabeled ATP to 90 μM. Reactions were carried out for various times (1, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min) at room temperature and stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 5 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Phosphorylated products were separated by SDS-PAGE; gels were Coomassie-stained, dried, and autoradiographed. Band quantitation was performed using a FUJIX PhosphorImager with MacBAS-1000 software. In order to study the effect of HA on protein synthesis, MCF-7 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml, 1, 200 Ci/mmol) in methionine-free media for increasing time periods in the presence or absence of HA or its carrier (Me2SO). Conversely, to assess the effect of HA on protein degradation, MCF-7 cells were prelabeled to isotopic equilibrium with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml, 1, 200 Ci/mmol) in methionine-free media for 24 h and chased with unlabeled methionine (150 μg/ml) for a subsequent 24-h period. One h into the chase, cultures received either herbimycin A (5 μg/ml) or Me2SO to 0.5%, and these conditions were maintained until the completion of the chase. Lysates were made at different time points in both types of experiments, and samples containing equal protein content were immunoprecipitated for IGF-IR as described above. Gels containing radiolabeled samples were Coomassie Blue-stained, fluorographed by impregnation with EN3HANCE (DuPont NEN), dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Band quantitation was performed using a FUJIX PhosphorImager with MacBAS-1000 software. IGFs and high concentrations of insulin activate IGF-IR and are mitogenic for MCF-7 cells under serum-free conditions (22Sepp-Lorenzino L. Rosen N. Lebwohl D.E. Cell Growth & Diff. 1994; 5: 1077-1083PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of MCF-7 cells with HA not only blocked insulin- and IGF-I-induced mitogenesis induced by activation of IGF-IR, but also inhibited proliferation induced by 10% fetal bovine serum (data not shown). This inhibitory effect was dose dependent and observed with HA concentrations as low as 10 ng/ml (17.4 nM) (data not shown). In order to understand the antiproliferative effect of HA in these cells, we first examined whether it impaired IGF-IR function. As shown in Fig. 1A, insulin stimulation of serum-starved MCF-7 cells at concentrations that stimulate IGF-IR (5 min, 1 μM) led to two major changes on phosphotyrosine blots of total cellular protein: phosphorylation of the β-subunit of the receptor (~100 kDa) and of a family of insulin receptor substrates (IRS) with ~185 kDa (Fig. 1). Preincubation of the cells with increasing concentrations of HA caused a dose-dependent decrease in the phosphotyrosine content of those insulin-responsive substrates (Fig. 1A). Immunoprecipitation of the IGF-IR followed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody confirmed the identity of the 100 kDa band as the β-subunit of the receptor (Fig. 1B). We have previously observed that in MCF-7 cells, the p120-rasGTPase-activating protein (GAP) becomes tyrosine phosphorylated following insulin treatment.2 2L. Sepp-Lorenzino, Z. Ma, D. E. Lebwolhl, A. Vinitsky, and N. Rosen, unpublished observations. Tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP by insulin was also reduced in a dose-dependent manner following treatment with herbimycin A (Fig. 1C). Therefore, HA led to a dose-dependent inhibition of insulin-activated IGF-IR kinase activity and biological response as measured by phosphorylation of substrates and mitogenesis. We investigated whether the ligand-activated tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR was affected by the drug in in vitro kinase assays. Immobilized IGF-IR, immunoprecipitated from insulin-stimulated MCF-7 cells, was preincubated with 5 μg/ml of HA for 60 min prior to kinase assays. In the absence of DTT, 5 μg/ml (8.7 μM) of HA decreased the rate of IGF-IR autophosphorylation to approximately 50% of that obtained for vehicle alone (Me2SO) (Fig. 2, A and B versus C and D). No inhibition was observed in the presence of reducing agents (Fig. 2, C and D), which supports the previous finding that sulfhydryl groups inactivate HA(3Uehara Y. Fukazawa H. Murakami Y. Mizuno S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although we were able to observe a direct effect of HA on the IGF-IR kinase in vitro, the concentrations required to observe this effect were at least 100-fold higher than those required to inhibit receptor function in the intact cell (Fig. 1). The difference in concentrations required for inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases in vitro and in the cell suggests either that intracellular HA is converted into a more potent inhibitor, or that other mechanisms of inhibition predominate. As shown in Fig. 3, HA led to a dose- and time-dependent reduction of the cellular content of IGF-IR (precursor as well as mature receptor) in MCF-7 cells, as detected on immunoblots of total cellular protein or of immunoprecipitated receptor. This effect was pronounced at 0.1 μg/ml of HA (Fig. 3A), and relatively rapid, noticeable after 4 h, and complete by 24 h (Fig. 3B). To test whether this reduction in the receptor levels was due to a generalized effect on protein metabolism, we analyzed the effect of HA on the steady-state levels of other cellular proteins. The profile of [35S]methionine-labeled total proteins revealed that there was no overall decrease in protein levels induced by HA treatment (not shown). Western blots for p85-phosphatidylinositol 3’-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C-γ, SHC, and GAP (Fig. 3C) demonstrated that the cellular abundance of this group of proteins was not affected by the presence of HA in MCF-7 cells. The cellular abundance of other proteins such as α- and β-catenin, E-cadherin, and of serine/threonine protein kinases such as cdk2, erk-1, and erk-2 was also not affected by HA (not shown). The same response to HA was observed in a different breast cancer cell line, MDA MB-468, which expresses abundant amounts of IR and overexpresses EGFR(22Sepp-Lorenzino L. Rosen N. Lebwohl D.E. Cell Growth & Diff. 1994; 5: 1077-1083PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dickson R.B. Bates S.E. McManaway M.E. Lippman M.E. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1707-1713PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, a similar dose- and time-dependent reduction in the steady-state levels of tyrosine kinase receptors by HA was observed (Fig. 4). Moreover, p56lck levels were decreased in response to HA in Colo 205 colon carcinoma cells, as was c-kit in mast cells (data not shown). It was recently shown that the steady-state levels of erbB-2 in MDA MB-453 cells (24Miller P. DiOrio C. Moyer M. Schnur R.C. Bruskin A. Cullen W. Moyer J.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2724-2730PubMed Google Scholar) and of EGFR in A431 cells (41) were also reduced in response to HA treatment. In summary, HA does not cause a generalized effect on protein turnover, but rather it seems to affect protein tyrosine kinases primarily. Changes in steady-state levels can be accomplished by altered rates of synthesis or degradation. Equilibrium labeling of MCF-7 cells with [35S]methionine followed by chase with cold methionine in the presence or absence of HA was used to measure the effect of the drug on IGF-IR degradation. As shown in Fig. 4, A-C, HA induced an accelerated rate of IGF-IR degradation in MCF-7 cells. The apparent half-life of both receptor subunits (the extracellular, ligand-binding α-subunit and the intracellular, tyrosine kinase-containing β-subunit) was shortened from more than 24 h in control cultures to approximately 6-7 h in the presence of the drug. Similar results were observed for the EGFR in MDA MB-468 cells (data not shown). On the other hand, no significant differences in the rate of [35S]methionine incorporation into IGF-IR were observed in pulse-labeling experiments, whether or not HA was present (Fig. 4D). Thus, tyrosine kinase synthesis is not appreciably affected by HA. Therefore, the rapid decrease in receptor tyrosine kinase steady-state levels observed upon HA treatment is due to an increased rate of receptor degradation. Most intracellular protein degradation is catalyzed by lysosomal proteases (25Knop M. Schiffer H.H. Rupp S. Wolf D.H. Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 990-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Gruenberg J. Howell K.E. Annu. Rev.

We employed a series of inhibitors of the lysosomal and ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathways to determine the mechanism by which HA induces receptor degradation. These experiments were performed in the absence of receptor ligand in order to exclude ligand-induced, lysosome-dependent degradation(25Knop M. Schiffer H.H. Rupp S. Wolf D.H. Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 990-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Gruenberg J. Howell K.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), a process involved in the down-regulation of activated receptors. Lysosomal function was blocked by the lysosomotropic bases ammonium chloride and chloroquine. In order to inhibit the proteolytic activity of the 20S proteasome (the proteolytic core of the 26S protease), a series of peptidyl aldehydes(19Vinitsky A. Cardozo C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Michaud C.

The sequences of these inhibitors are based on known substrates of the 20S proteasome; the presence of a C-terminal aldehyde is required for inhibition of peptide bond hydrolysis(19Vinitsky A. Cardozo C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Michaud C. Orlowski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29860-29866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptidyl aldehyde inhibitors were shown to block protein degradation catalyzed by the 20S proteasome in vitro and the 26S protease-mediated intracellular degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, whereas the peptidyl alcohols from which they were derived did not(19Vinitsky A. Cardozo C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Michaud C. Orlowski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29860-29866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).3 The most effective inhibitors of the 20S proteasome are GAFL-al (4al) and GLAL-al (5al) which strongly inhibit all of its five proteolytic components.3 When these inhibitors were added to cells together with HA they completely prevented the enhanced degradation of IGF-IR (Fig. 5, A and B). We next employed a series of peptidyl aldehyde inhibitors of the branched-chain amino acid preferring (BrAAP) component of the 20S proteasome, which is thought to be the major factor in protein degradation by this protease(19Vinitsky A. Cardozo C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Michaud C. Orlowski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29860-29866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, the potencies of the peptidyl aldehyde inhibitors of the BrAAP component in reverting the HA-induced IGF-IR degradation are directly correlated with their ability to inhibit that component in vitro(19Vinitsky A. Cardozo C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Michaud C. Orlowski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29860-29866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).3 That correlation also held for the ability of the inhibitors of BrAAP to affect accumulation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates in treated cells (not shown and 19). The most potent inhibitor from the series, GPFL-al, was able to revert IGF-IR levels to 75% of the levels from untreated controls (Fig. 5B). Bz-Pro-prolinal (PP-al), a peptidyl aldehyde inhibitor of prolyl endopeptidase (20Wilk S. Orlowski M. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) used to prolong the half-life of the peptidyl aldehyde inhibitors, had no effect on the levels of IGF-IR. Lysosomotropic agents or the inactive peptidyl alcohol analogs were also without effect in preventing the HA-induced IGF-IR degradation (Fig. 5, A and B). Moreover, the nonspecific serine- and cysteine-protease inhibitors PMSF, leupeptin, and E64d, and calpain inhibitor II (a potent inhibitor of cytosolic calpains and of lysosomal cathepsin B(25Knop M. Schiffer H.H. Rupp S. Wolf D.H. Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 990-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Gruenberg J. Howell K.E. Annu. Rev.

None of these general protease inhibitors affects the rate of protein degradation by the 20S proteasome at the ran"

Recently, we have characterized a Xenopus laevis cDNA (XL-15) that encodes a selenoprotein with type III deiodinase activity (St. Germain, D.

Using the XL-15 as a probe, we screened a rat neonatal skin cDNA library. Among the clones isolated was one (rNS43-1) which contained a 2.1-kilobase pair cDNA insert that manifested significant homology to both the XL-15 and the G21 rat type I deiodinase cDNAs, including the presence of an in-frame TGA codon. Expression studies demonstrated that the rNS43-1 cDNA encodes a protein with 5-, but not 5’-, deiodinase activity that is resistant to inhibition by propylthiouracil and aurothioglucose. Northern analysis demonstrated a pattern of tissue expression in the rat consistent with that of the type III deiodinase and site directed mutagenesis confirmed that the TGA triplet codes for selenocysteine. We conclude that the rNS43-1 cDNA encodes the rat type III deiodinase and that the types I and III deiodinases present in amphibians and mammals constitute a family of conserved selenoproteins important in the metabolism of thyroid hormones.

We conclude that the rNS43-1 cDNA encodes the rat type III deiodinase and that the types I and III deiodinases present in amphibians and mammals constitute a family of conserved selenoproteins important in the metabolism of thyroid hormones. The varying patterns of thyroid hormone metabolism occurring in different tissues and during different stages of development are dictated in large part by the selective expression of one or more of several iodothyronine deiodinases. During fetal development in many species, including mammals, the predominant metabolic process involves the catalytic removal of iodine at the 5-, or the chemically equivalent 3-, position on the tyrosyl, or inner, ring of thyroxine (T4)1 1The abbreviations used are: T4thyroxineT33,5,3’-triiodothyronineT23,3’-diiodothyroninerT33,3’,5’-triiodothyronine5-D5-deiodinase5’-D5’-deiodinasePCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase pair(s). and 3,5,3’-triiodothyronine (T3). This 5-deiodinase (5-D) activity results in the formation of the essentially inactive metabolites 3,3’,5’-triiodothyronine (reverse T3, rT3) and 3,3’-diiodothyronine (T2), respectively(1Germain St., D.L. Wu S.-Y. Visser T.J. Thyroid Hormone Metabolism: Molecular Biology and Alternative Pathways. CRC Press, Ann Arbor, MI1994: 45-66Google Scholar). The type III deiodinase, which functions exclusively as a 5-D, is highly expressed in both mammalian placenta and several fetal tissues and thus likely contributes significantly to this metabolic process(2Visser T.J. Schoenmakers C.H.H. Acta Med. Austriaca. 1992; 19: 18-21PubMed Google Scholar). After birth, the expression of type III 5-D is more limited and in rats occurs primarily in the central nervous system and skin, with particularly high levels noted in the latter tissue during the neonatal period(3Huang T. Chopra I.J. Beredo A. Solomon D.H. Chua Teco G.N. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 2106-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, the type I deiodinase is highly expressed in the liver, kidney, and thyroid gland of adult rats and can function as both a 5’-deiodinase (5’-D) and a 5-D. However, it efficiently catalyzes the 5-deiodination of sulfated iodothyronine substrates only (4Moreno M. Berry M.J. Horst C. Thomas R. Goglia F. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Visser T.J.

Of note, this amphibian cDNA, like the previously isolated mammalian type I deiodinase cDNAs(8Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R.

The structural features of the mammalian type III deiodinase are uncertain, and several lines of evidence have suggested that this subclass of enzymes does not contain selenocysteine. Thus, the rat type III deiodinase is resistant to inhibition by propylthiouracil and gold compounds such as aurothioglucose(11Santini F. Chopra I.J. Hurd R.E. Solomon D.H. Chua Teco G.N.

In addition, type III activity is maintained at essentially normal levels in the brain(13Meinhold H. Campos-Barros A. Walzog B. Köhler R. Müller F. Behne D. Exp. Clin.

And finally, protein labeling studies using 75Se have failed to identify candidate selenoproteins in rat tissues manifesting type III activity (11Santini F. Chopra I.J. Hurd R.E. Solomon D.H.

In the present report we describe the isolation from a rat neonatal skin cDNA library of a cDNA that manifests significant sequence homology to the mammalian type I and amphibian type III deiodinase cDNAs, including the presence of an in-frame TGA codon. X. laevis oocytes injected with RNA transcripts derived from this cDNA express abundant 5-D activity with characteristics of the type III enzyme. For the preparation of RNA, skin samples from 7-14-day-old neonatal rats and their corresponding dams were harvested and homogenized as described previously(16Germain St., D.L. Morganelli C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3054-3056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by two cycles of chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose and used for injection into X. laevis oocytes and cDNA library construction. RNA from other tissues used for Northern analysis was prepared by the same methods. In one experiment, rats were rendered hyperthyroid by the injection of 50 μg T3 subcutaneously/100 g body weight for 4 days prior to sacrifice. Poly(A)+ RNA from neonatal rat skin was used with oligo(dT) primers to prepare double-stranded cDNA using reagents from the Choice kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following the addition of EcoRI linkers, this material was used to construct a cDNA library in the Lambda-Zap II vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Screening of the library was performed using plaque hybridization under low stringency conditions according to the methods of Lees et al.(17Lees J.A. Saito M. Vidal M. Valentine M. Look T. Harlow E. Dyson N. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7813-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The first 732 nucleotides of the XL-15 cDNA, which includes most of the coding region, was used as a probe. Positive plaques were detected by autoradiography and purified by additional rounds of screening using the same hybridization conditions. cDNA inserts were sequenced on both strands using gene-specific primers and an automated sequencing system with fluorescent dye terminators (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Stage 5-6 X. laevis oocytes were isolated and each microinjected as described previously (16Germain St., D.L. Morganelli C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3054-3056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 5-50 ng of either poly(A)+ RNA or 50 ng of in vitro synthesized capped RNA transcripts prepared using the MEGAscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). After injection, oocytes were incubated for 4 days in Barth's medium (for determination of 5-D activity) or L-15 medium (for determination of 5’-D activity), then harvested, membrane fractions prepared as described previously (18Sharifi J. Germain St., D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12539-12544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and deiodinase activity determined according to published methods(18Sharifi J. Germain St., D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12539-12544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Germain St., D.L. Croteau W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 2049-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In kinetic studies, 5-D activity was determined using 1-20 nM [125I]T3 and 50 mM dithiothreitol as cofactor. Kinetic constants were determined from double reciprocal plots. 125I-Labeled iodothyronines used as substrates were obtained from E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co. and purified by chromatography using Sephadex LH-20 (Sigma) prior to use. In other experiments, the deiodinase activities in oocyte membrane preparations were determined in the absence or presence of propylthiouracil (10-1000 μM) or aurothioglucose (0.01-10 μM). 5’-D activity was measured using 67 nM [125I]rT3 as substrate and 20 mM dithiothreitol as cofactor. The 5-D assay utilized 1 nM [125I]T3 and 20 or 50 mM dithiothreitol. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with reagents obtained from Bio-Rad. The G21 cDNA was kindly provided by Drs. M. Berry and P. R. Larsen (Boston, MA). The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed as described previously(21Davey J.C. Schneider M.J. Galton V.A. Dev. Genet. 1994; 15: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In brief, 0.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from rat neonatal skin or placenta was digested with 0.1 unit of RNase-free DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.), then reverse-transcribed using Superscript™ II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the rNS43-1-derived antisense oligonucleotide designated 1148AS (5’-GTCACTTGTCCCTTGGTTTT-3’) as primer. Following treatment with RNase H (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5 μl of the reaction mixture (total volume, 30 μl) was used directly in PCR. PCR was performed using the hot start method with five pairs of rNS43-1-derived oligonucleotides as primers used in different reactions. In all cases, 668AS (5’-GATGCGCTGGCTCTGGAA-3’) was used as the antisense primer. Sense primers included Bluescript/M13 reverse, 133S (5’-GGGCGGCTGTGTGAGT-3’), 226S (5’-CAGGGAGACCAGAAAGCAGAG-3’), 262S (5’-GGTCGGAGAAGGTGAAGGG-3’), and 319S (5’-CTCCCTGCTGCTTCACTCT-3’). Reaction conditions included 32 cycles of 94°C × 1 min, 55°C × 45 s, and 72°C × 1 min and a final 10-min extension period. Reaction products were separated on a 3% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The PCR reaction products separated by agarose gel electrophoresis were transferred by capillary blotting to nylon membranes (MagnaCharge, MSI, Inc., Westboro, MA) and probed using the 32P-radiolabeled rNS43-1-derived 430AS oligonucleotide (5’-GGAAATGCTTGCGGATG-3’). Following washing, membranes were autoradiographed for 10-60 min. Northern analysis was performed using 5-10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/sample as described previously (22O'Mara B.A. Dittrich W. Lauterio T.J. Germain St., D.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1715-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), except that hybridization was performed at 42°C and the blots were subsequently washed twice at room temperature in 2 × SSPE (1 × SSPE: 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 1 nM EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS × 10 min; once at room temperature in 0.1 x SSPE, 0.1% SDS × 10 min; then once at 42°C in 0.1 x SSPE, 0.1% SDS × 60 min prior to autoradiography. In some experiments, blots were also washed an additional time at 60°C in 0.1 x SSPE, 0.1% SDS. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Altered Sites mutagenesis system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis using the methods described above. For each construct, oocytes were injected with 50 ng of capped RNA transcripts synthesized in vitro. Four days later 5-D activity was determined as described above. Activity was compared with that obtained in uninjected oocytes and those injected with an equivalent amount of RNA synthesized from the wild type cDNA in the pAlter vector (Promega). The choice of tissue for constructing a cDNA library was based on expression studies in X. laevis oocytes (Fig. 1). Injection into oocytes of 5 ng of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from neonatal rat skin or rat placenta induced significant amounts of 5-D activity which manifested a Km (using T3 as substrate) of ~3 nM, consistent with the properties of a type III deiodinase(1Germain St., D.L. Wu S.-Y. Visser T.J. Thyroid Hormone Metabolism: Molecular Biology and Alternative Pathways. CRC Press, Ann Arbor, MI1994: 45-66Google Scholar, 3Huang T. Chopra I.J. Beredo A. Solomon D.H. Chua Teco G.N. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 2106-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, injection of 50 ng/oocyte of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the skin of lactating dams induced little or no 5-D activity, a finding in agreement with the low levels of activity previously noted in homogenates prepared from this tissue(3Huang T. Chopra I.J. Beredo A. Solomon D.H. Chua Teco G.N. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 2106-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Screening of a neonatal skin library by plaque hybridization under low stringency conditions with the coding region of the XL-15 amphibian type III deiodinase cDNA as a probe resulted in the identification and isolation of seven different clones. Partial DNA sequencing of several of the cDNA inserts from these clones revealed areas that had significant homology to the XL-15 cDNA. Two clones designated rNS27-1 and rNS43-1, containing 1.5- and 2.1-kb inserts, respectively, were selected for detailed expression studies and complete sequencing. Functional characterization of the protein products of the isolated cDNA was carried out using the X. laevis oocyte translational assay system. Oocytes injected with RNA synthesized in vitro using clone rNS43-1 as template expressed high levels of 5-D activity as determined by the conversion of [125I]T3 to [125I]T2. Such activity was dependent on the presence of relatively high concentrations of dithiothreitol (Fig. 2), requiring 50 mM dithiothreitol for maximal activity. In contrast, type I 5’-D activity induced by the injection of RNA derived from the G21 cDNA was near-maximal with only 0.1 mM dithiothreitol in the reaction mixture. Unlike the 5’-D activity of the type I deiodinase(18Sharifi J. Germain St., D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12539-12544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glutathione at concentrations of 5 and 50 mM did not support 5-D activity in oocyte membranes injected with rNS43-1-derived RNA (data not shown). Using 50 mM dithiothreitol as cofactor, kinetic analysis of the rNS43-1-induced 5-D activity revealed a Km value for T3 of 1 nM. Using rT3 as substrate and 20 mM dithiothreitol as cofactor, no 5’-D activity was detected in rNS43-1-injected oocyte membrane fractions. Injection into oocytes of RNA derived from clone rNS27-1, which lacks sequences in the 5’ region of the open reading frame of rNS43-1 (see below), did not induce 5-D activity (data not shown). A comparison was made of the sensitivity of the rNS43-1 5-D and the G21 type I 5’-D to inhibition by propylthiouracil and aurothioglucose. As expected(8Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), the G21-induced 5’-D activity was highly sensitive to inhibition by propylthiouracil with a concentration of 100 μM inhibiting activity by essentially 100% (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the induced rNS43-1 5-D activity was resistant to high concentrations of propylthiouracil. Similarly, the G21 deiodinase was at least 100-fold more sensitive than the rNS43-1 deiodinase to the inhibitory effects of aurothioglucose; 50% inhibition of G21-induced type I activity occurred at approximately 0.01 μM aurothioglucose, whereas 1 μM was required to obtain the same level of inhibition of the rNS43-1-induced activity (Fig. 3B). The studies depicted in Fig. 3 were performed using different concentrations of dithiothreitol in the 5’-D and 5-D assays. Because the sensitivity of these processes to propylthiouracil can be influenced by the concentration of cofactor(23Leonard J.L. Rosenberg I.N. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 2137-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24Goswami A. Rosenberg I.N. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we determined in other experiments that at equivalent concentrations of dithiothreitol (20 mM), the marked disparity in the inhibitory effects of propylthiouracil on the G21 and rNS43-1 deiodinases persist (data not shown). A diagram of the rNS27-1 and rNS43-1 cDNAs is shown in Fig. 4. The sequence of the rNS27-1 cDNA is identical to nucleotides 549-2081 of the rNS43-1 cDNA. The latter cDNA contains an open reading frame of 834 nucleotides encoding a protein of 278 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 31.6 kDa. Of note is an in-frame TGA codon, presumably coding for selenocysteine, beginning at nucleotide 740 and located in a region of high homology to the XL-15 protein and the mammalian type I deiodinases (see below). A search of GenBank™ for homologous nucleotide sequences identified the XL-15 cDNA, previously isolated mammalian type I deiodinase cDNAs (from rat, human, dog), and a 283-nucleotide partial cDNA isolated from a human skeletal muscle library (accession number Z19511) which shows 80% sequence identity to nucleotides 1-196 of the rNS43-1 cDNA. The identity of this human cDNA has not been established. Because of the unexpected homology of a portion of the rNS43-1 cDNA to a human skeletal muscle cDNA, and the finding that previously isolated cDNAs for other deiodinases have relatively short 5’-untranslated regions (6Germain St., D.L.

The experimental approach is depicted in Fig. 5A. Reverse transcription was carried out using poly(A)+ RNA from rat neonatal skin or rat placenta and the rNS43-1-derived antisense oligonucleotide 1148AS as a primer. The resulting cDNA was then used in the PCR with a number of different primer pairs derived from the rNS43-1 cDNA sequence (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 5A). In addition, to detect any contamination with the rNS43-1 plasmid during the procedures, a primer pair which included the Bluescript/M13 reverse sequencing primer was also used. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining followed by transfer of the products to nylon membranes and Southern blotting using the nested oligonucleotide 430AS as a probe. Expected amplicon sizes for each primer pair, based on the rNS43-1 sequence, were 882 (rev/668AS), 553 (133S/668AS), 460 (226S/668AS), 424 (262S/668AS), and 367 (319S/668AS) nucleotides. As shown in Fig. 5B, control PCR reactions using the rNS43-1 plasmid as template (lanes 7-11) demonstrated the expected size products for all primer combinations, thus confirming the usefulness of these primer pairs for amplifying the desired rNS43-1-related sequences. In contrast, only primer pairs 262S/668AS and 319S/668AS gave demonstrable products of the correct size by ethidium bromide staining (data not shown) and Southern blotting when cDNA derived from rat neonatal skin (lanes 1-5) or rat placenta (lanes 12-16) were used as templates in the PCR. No amplification was noted with the primer pair rev/668AS using either cDNA preparation (lanes 1 and 12, respectively). Nor was amplification noted when (a) reverse transcriptase (lanes 6, 17, and 18) or (b) RNA (lanes 19-21) were omitted from the initial cDNA synthesis step or when (c) PCR reaction tubes contained water in place of an aliquot of the cDNA synthesis mixture (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that sequences in the rNS43-1 cDNA insert located 5’ to oligonucleotide 262S are not present in the type III deiodinase mRNA from neonatal skin and placenta. At present, the identity of these sequences is uncertain; their presence in the rNS43-1 cDNA may represent a cloning artifact secondary to the inclusion of two unrelated cDNA inserts in this clone. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the rNS43-1 cDNA are shown in Fig. 6. Uppercase letters represent the sequences proven for the type III deiodinase and start at the point corresponding to oligonucleotide 262S. The 261 nucleotides of unknown origin in the region 5’ to this are shown in lowercase letters. Northern analysis of rat tissues was performed using the rNS27-1 cDNA, which contains only deiodinase cDNA sequences, as a probe (Fig. 7). Using poly(A)+ RNA from neonatal skin and placenta, a single RNA species of 2.2 kb in size was noted. No hybridization was detected to RNA derived from liver, kidney, or the skin of postpartum (lactating) rats, all tissues which contain little or no type III deiodinase activity. In the cerebral cortex of euthyroid adult rats, a more complex hybridization pattern was noted with several faint bands visualized. Of note, the two larger RNA species of approximately 3.3 and 3.6 kb appeared more abundant after T3 administration to induce hyperthyroidism. Type III activity in this tissue was also increased with T3 administration (data not shown). In both skeletal muscle and cerebral cortex, a smaller band at 1.6 kb was faintly visible. These hybridization patterns did not significantly change when blots were washed at 60°C. Previous studies of the rat type I deiodinase and the XL-15 type III deiodinase have demonstrated that the presence of selenocysteine is critical for the catalytic activity of the protein(6Germain St., D.L. Schwartzman R. Croteau W. Kanamori A. Wang Z. Brown D.D. Galton V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91 (Correction): 7767-7771Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91 (Correction): 11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Thus, substitution of cysteine for selenocysteine in these proteins reduces expressed catalytic activity by approximately 76-90%, in spite of increased translational efficiency of the cysteine mutant(25Berry M.J. Maia A.L. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1848-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of selenocysteine to the functional activity of the rNS43-1-encoded deiodinase, site-directed mutagenesis of the TGA codon was performed. Conversion of this triplet to a TAA stop codon, or a TTA leucine codon, abolished expression in oocytes. The TGT cysteine mutant was also essentially inactive, manifesting less than 5% of wild type 5-D activity in four experiments. To ensure that this lack of activity of the cysteine mutant did not result from some other unplanned alteration in structure, the mutant cDNA was sequenced in its entirety and found to be otherwise identical to the rNS43-1. In addition, RNA derived from a second isolated cysteine mutant clone also exhibited a comparably low level of activity when expressed in X. laevis oocytes. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the rNS43-1 protein with that of other deiodinases (6Germain St., D.L. Schwartzman R. Croteau W. Kanamori A. Wang Z. Brown D.D. Galton V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91 (Correction): 7767-7771Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91 (Correction): 11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R.

On alignment of the deiodinase protein sequences published to date(6Germain St., D.L. Schwartzman R. Croteau W. Kanamori A. Wang Z. Brown D.D. Galton V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20329-20334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), several regions of conservation in the mid- and carboxyl-terminal portions of the molecules are evident (Fig. 8). High homology is noted in the regions surrounding the selenocysteine (designated “X” at amino acid 144 in r5DIII [rNS43-1]) and surrounding a histidine residue (amino acid 176) demonstrated by Berry et al.(26Berry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18055-18059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to be essential for type I deiodinase activity. Amino acid identity in these two regions is 83 and 75%, respectively. The structural and functional data presented herein, as well as the patterns of tissue expression as determined by Northern analysis, indicate that the rNS43-1 cDNA encodes the rat type III 5-D. Of paramount importance is the finding that this cDNA contains an in-frame TGA codon. Although we have not directly demonstrated that the rNS43-1-encoded enzyme is a selenoprotein, the mutagenesis studies, the strong amino acid conservation present in all the deiodinases in the region of this codon, and preliminary studies identifying a selenocysteine insertion element in the 3’-untranslated region of the cDNA2 2B. Moyer and D. L. St. Germain, unpublished observations. provide compelling evidence that the TGA encodes selenocysteine rather than a termination signal. Thus, the type I and type III deiodinases constitute a family of structurally related selenoproteins. To date, the type II 5’-D has not yet been purified, nor have cDNAs been isolated. The structural characteristics of the type II enzyme therefore remain uncertain. The finding that the rNS43-1 cDNA encodes a selenoprotein has important implications for the study of selenoproteins in general and deiodinases in particular. First, previous studies by Berry et al.(12Berry M.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14155-14158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that mutagenesis of the selenocysteine in the type I deiodinase to cysteine renders that enzyme insensitive to propylthiouracil and gold compounds. This finding suggested that the unique biochemical properties of selenocysteine confer sensitivity to these inhibitors. However, the present studies, as well as our previous demonstration that the XL-15 deiodinase is resistant to these agents (6Germain St., D.L. Schwartzman R. Croteau W. Kanamori A. Wang Z. Brown D.D. Galton V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91 (Correction): 7767-7771Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91 (Correction): 11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), indicates that factors other than the presence of selenocysteine, such as those related to protein structure or kinetic mechanisms, must dictate insensitivity to propylthiouracil and aurothioglucose in the type III deiodinases. Second, it has previously been demonstrated that type III deiodinase activity in rat brain, placenta, and skin are largely preserved in the face of nutritional selenium deprivation severe enough to markedly lower type I protein and activity levels in the liver and kidney (13Meinhold H. Campos-Barros A. Walzog B. Köhler R. Müller F. Behne D. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. 1993; 101: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Chanoine J. Alex S. Stone S. Fang S.L. Veronikis I. Leonard J.L. Braverman L.E. Pediatr. Res. 1993; 34: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Veronikis I.E. Alex S. Emerson C.H. Fang S.L. Wright G. Braverman L.E. in 68th Meeting of the American Thyroid Association. 1994; (Chicago, IL, Abstr. 69)Google Scholar). Our demonstration that the type III deiodinase in this species is a selenoprotein indicates that selenium stores in the former tissues are preserved in the face of moderate selenium deficiency. Although prior studies of selenium turnover have demonstrated that the brain, like the thyroid gland, testes, and other endocrine organs (27Behne D. Hilmert H. Scheid S. Gessner H. Elger W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 966: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 28Buckman T.D. Sutphin M.S. Eckhert C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Chanoine J. Braverman L.E. Farwell A.P. Safran M. Alex S. Dubord S. Leonard J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2709-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), has a marked propensity to conserve selenium, the data presented herein are the first to suggest that placenta and skin share this property. This is of particular interest given that placental selenium stores must be accumulated de novo during pregnancy, a circumstance which presumably should predisposes this organ to selenium deficiency in the setting of nutritional selenium deprivation. Third, the inability of others using 75Se to label a candidate type III deiodinase protein of 32 kDa in appropriate tissues (e.g. brain, placenta) points out the insensitivity of these methods to identify selenoproteins(11Santini F. Chopra I.J. Hurd R.E. Solomon D.H. Chua Teco G.N. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2325-2332PubMed Google Scholar, 27Behne D. Hilmert H. Scheid S. Gessner H. Elger W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 966: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). This is not surprising given that little is known about the rates of entry of selenium into various tissues, selenium pool sizes, or the abundance and turnover rates of most selenoproteins. The importance of selenocysteine to the catalytic activity of the deiodinases is reaffirmed by the present studies. Indeed, unlike the type I enzymes and the XL-15 deiodinase which retain a significant, albeit substantially reduced (10-24%), level of activity when cysteine is substituted for selenocysteine(6Germain St., D.L. Schwartzman R. Croteau W. Kanamori A. Wang Z. Brown D.D. Galton V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91 (Correction): 7767-7771Proc. Natl. Acad.

Nature. 1991; 349: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), the cysteine mutant of the rNS43-1 cDNA is essentially inactive. Given that activity was determined using an in vivo expression system, it is uncertain whether this lack of activity reflects an intrinsically inactive protein or whether expression of the protein was impaired due to a decreased half-life of the injected RNA or the cysteine mutant protein. However, the latter two possibilities appear unlikely given that the cysteine mutants of other deiodinases induce significant levels of activity in X. laevis oocytes(6Germain St., D.L. Schwartzman R. Croteau W. Kanamori A. Wang Z. Brown D.D. Galton V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91 (Correction): 7767-7771Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91 (Correction): 11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Northern analysis revealed hybridization of the type III deiodinase probe to multiple species in different tissues. In neonatal skin and placenta only a single transcript was identified that was somewhat larger in size than the 1.8-kb size of the rNS43-1 type III deiodinase sequences. In the cerebral cortex, however, larger hybridizing species were observed, and a low intensity 1.6-kb band was noted in both cerebral cortex and skeletal muscle. Whether such species represent alternatively processed transcripts or products of a related gene remains uncertain. Of note, relatively high levels of 5-D activity have been measured in fetal rat skeletal muscle(30Huang T. Chopra I.J. Boado R. Solomon D.H. Chua Teco G.N. Pediatr. Res. 1988; 23: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the adult rat, however, levels in this tissue are only 2% of that found in cerebral cortex or skin(30Huang T. Chopra I.J. Boado R. Solomon D.H. Chua Teco G.N. Pediatr. Res. 1988; 23: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the five mammalian and amphibian deiodinase proteins reported to date (6Germain St., D.L. Schwartzman R. Croteau W. Kanamori A. Wang Z. Brown D.D. Galton V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91 (Correction): 7767-7771Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91 (Correction): 11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Berry M.J. Banu L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20329-20334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that the rNS43-1 protein is more closely related to the amphibian XL-15 enzyme than to the mammalian type I deiodinases. This finding is consistent with the similar functional characteristics of the 5-D activity displayed by these two proteins. In contrast, the activity of the rNS43-1 deiodinase differs markedly from that of the mammalian type I enzymes in that it manifests no 5’-D activity and is able to catalyze efficiently the 5-deiodination of non-sulfated iodothyronine substrates. Although little primary sequence homology is present in the amino-terminal portions of the deiodinases (Fig. 8), all contain a region of marked hydrophobicity, which in the rNS43-1 protein encompasses the initial 42 amino acid residues. Toyoda et al.(31Toyoda N. Berry M. Larsen P.R. in 76th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society. 1994; (Anaheim, CA, Abstr. 4)Google Scholar) have provided evidence that the analogous hydrophobic region in the rat type I deiodinase serves to anchor the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Given that the type III deiodinases are also membrane proteins, such regions in the rNS43-1 and XL-15 proteins likely serve a similar function. In other studies, these investigators have recently demonstrated that mutation of a phenylalanine at position 65 in the human and rat type I deiodinases results in marked inefficiency of these enzymes in utilizing rT3 as a substrate for 5’-deiodination(10Toyoda N. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20329-20334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but does not affect the inner ring deiodination of appropriate sulfated substrates(4Moreno M. Berry M.J. Horst C. Thomas R. Goglia F. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Visser T.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The observation that the rNS43-1 and XL-15 deiodinases lack a phenylalanine at the corresponding locations provides further evidence that such a residue is not critical for 5-deiodination of T4 or T3. The ability of the mammalian type III deiodinase to convert T4 and T3 to metabolically inactive metabolites, as well as its patterns of expression and regulation in the placenta during fetal development, and in the adult brain, suggest that it plays a protective role in preventing exposure of tissues to excessive levels of active thyroid hormones(1Germain St., D.L. Wu S.-Y. Visser T.J. Thyroid Hormone Metabolism: Molecular Biology and Alternative Pathways. CRC Press, Ann Arbor, MI1994: 45-66Google Scholar). This concept is strengthened by the observations of Silva and Matthews (32Silva J.E. Matthews P.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1035-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that in the cerebral cortex of neonatal rats the residency time of T3, a parameter likely dependent in large part on the activity of the type III deiodinase, is critical to thyroid hormone homeostasis in this organ. The isolation of the rNS43-1 cDNA thus provides an important tool for the further study of iodothyronine metabolism. In particular, the development of animal models with targeted deletion or overexpression of the type III deiodinase gene will allow a direct assessment of its physiologic role in thyroid hormone metabolism and a better understanding of thyroid hormone action during development and in selected tissues such as the brain."

Here, amyloid-associated apoE from 32 AD patients was purified and characterized. We found that brain amyloid-associated apoE apparently exists not as free molecules but as complexes with polymers of the amyloid beta peptide (A beta). Brain A beta-apoE complexes were detected irrespective of the apoE genotype, and similar complexes could be mimicked in vitro. The fine structure of purified A beta-apoE complexes was fibrillar, and immunogold labeling revealed apoE immunoreactivity along the fibrils. Thus, we conclude that A beta-apoE complexes are principal components of AD-associated brain amyloid and that the data presented here support a role for apoE in the pathogenesis of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2020854995,"Active ion-coupled glutamate transport is of critical importance for excitatory synaptic transmission, normal cellular function, and epithelial amino acid metabolism. We previously reported the cloning of the rabbit intestinal high affinity glutamate transporter EAAC1 (Kanai, Y., and Hediger, M. A.(1992) Nature 360, 467-471), which [Medline] is expressed in numerous tissues including intestine, kidney, liver, heart, and brain. Here, we report a detailed stoichiometric and kinetic analysis of EAAC1 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Uptake studies of 22Na+ and [14C]glutamate, in combination with measurements of intracellular pH with pH microelectrodes gave a glutamate to charge ratio of 1:1, a glutamate to Na+ ratio of 1:2, and a OH−/H+ to charge ratio of 1:1. Since transport is K+ dependent it can be concluded that EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport is coupled to the cotransport of 2 Na+ ions, the countertransport of one K+ ion and either the countertransport of one OH− ion or the cotransport of 1 H+ ion. We further demonstrate that under conditions where the electrochemical gradients for these ions are disrupted, EAAC1 runs in reverse, a transport mode which is of pathologic importance. 22Na+ uptake studies revealed that there is a low level of Na+ uptake in the absence of extracellular glutamate which appears to be analogous to the Na+ leak observed for the intestinal Na+/glucose cotransporter SGLT1. In voltage clamp studies, reducing extracellular Na+ from 100 to 10 mM strongly increased KL−glutamate and decreased Imax. The data indicate that Na+ binding at the extracellular transporter surface becomes rate-limiting. Studies addressing the cooperativity of the substrate-binding sites indicate that there are two distinct Na+-binding sites with different affinities and that Na+ binding is modulated by extracellular glutamate.

For glutamate to fulfill its diverse functions, the existence of active cellular glutamate uptake systems with a high accumulative power is of critical importance. The cDNAs encoding four different mammalian high affinity glutamate transporter isoforms have been recently cloned and characterized. These are the neuronal and epithelial glutamate transporter EAAC1 (EAAT3)(1Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar, 2Kanai Y. Stelzner M.

Neurosci. Abstract. 1994; 20: 925Google Scholar). These transporters exhibit 39-55% sequence identities with each other. Studies of glutamate transport in salamander retina glial cells suggest that transport is electrogenic and coupled to the cotransport of two Na+ ions and the countertransport of one K+ and one OH− ion(7Amato A. Barbour B. Szatkowski M. Attwell D. J. Physiol. 1994; 479: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Bouvier M. Szatkowski M. Amato A. Attwell D. Nature. 1992; 360: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The coupling pattern has not yet been conclusively investigated for the recombinant high affinity glutamate transporters. Knowledge of stoichiometry of cloned glutamate transporters, however, is of critical importance to determine their structure-function relationships and to understand their physiological and pathophysiological roles. Recent electrophysiological studies of electrogenic transporters provided important clues to how uphill solute transport is coupled to downhill electrochemical ion gradients. Experiments using the voltage jump paradigm to study the Na+/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) (9Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and the Na+/Cl−/GABA (10Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) transporter demonstrated current relaxation in response to voltage jumps similar to gating currents observed in voltage-gated ion channels. These currents were interpreted to reflect charge movement within the membrane electric field that is associated with conformational changes of the transporter molecule. It is likely that the identification of charged residues in these transporters that undergo transient movements will provide important information on the structure-function relationships of ion-coupled solute transporters. In the central nervous system, the coupling stoichiometry of EAAC1 also has pathologic implications. The reduced energy supply that occurs during ischemia after a stroke or during anoxia is known to lead to reduced ATP levels and reduced function of Na+,K+-ATPase and to result in rundown of electrochemical ion gradients(11Szatkowski M. Attwell D. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The disrupted ion gradients are thought to cause high affinity glutamate transporters to run in reverse resulting in a non-vesicular release of glutamate into the synaptic cleft. Since extracellular glutamate is highly toxic to neurons, reversed glutamate transport likely results in neuronal death as a result of these pathologic conditions. In the present study we investigated the electrogenic characteristics of EAAC1 using the voltage jump technique. We determined the coupling of EAAC1-mediated transport to inorganic ions, and we demonstrate that EAAC1 runs in reverse if we mimic the ischemic condition. cRNAs were in vitro transcribed from cDNAs in pSPORT1 using T7 RNA polymerase (1Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Xenopus oocyte expression studies were performed as described previously (12Hediger M.A. Coady M.J. Ikeda T.S. Wright E.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 13Hediger M.A. Ikeda T. Coady M. Gunderson C.B. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's medium (88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 0.33 mM Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mM CaCl2, 0.82 mM MgSO4, 2.4 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with gentamicin (50 μg/ml). Oocytes were used 3-6 days after injection for electrophysiological analyses and flux studies. The glutamate to charge stoichiometry was determined by comparing [14C]glutamate uptake and glutamate-induced inward current as described (14Kanai Y. Lee W.-S. You G. Brown D. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 15Fei Y.-J. Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Romero M.F. Singh S.K. Boron W.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Five days after injection, [14C]L-glutamate uptake (20 μM) by EAAC1 cRNA-injected oocytes and water-injected control oocytes were measured in standard uptake solution (100 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM Tris, pH 7.4) for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min. Immediately after completion of the uptake measurements, two microelectrode voltage clamp experiments (2Kanai Y. Stelzner M. Nussberger S. Khawaja S. Hebert S.C. Smith C.P. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20599-20606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were performed using the same batch of cRNA- or water-injected oocytes. The oocytes were bathed in the standard uptake solution, and the membrane potential was monitored after impaling oocytes. The bath medium was then changed to the uptake solution containing 20 μM of glutamate, and the membrane potential was measured. After washing with uptake solution without glutamate, each oocyte was clamped at this membrane potential. Inward currents evoked by bath-applied 20 μM glutamate at the above determined holding potentials were recorded, and the values were converted to the rate of charge flux using Faraday's constant (9.65 × 104 C/mol). L-Glutamate evoked currents were measured in uptake media containing n mM NaCl (where n was varied from 0 to 100 mM), 100 minus n mM choline chloride, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM Tris, pH 7.4. The currents were fitted by the Hill equation, and the Hill coefficients were calculated for each glutamate concentration. To determine the Na+ to glutamate stoichiometry, the uptakes of 22Na+ and [14C]L-glutamate were compared in the same batch of EAAC1 cRNA-injected oocytes. Groups of 8-10 oocytes were preincubated for 30 min in 1 ml of uptake medium containing 40 mM NaCl, 60 mM choline-chloride, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ouabain, 0.1 mM amiloride, 0.1 mM bumetanide, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM Tris, pH 7.4. Glutamate uptake was measured in the uptake solution containing 2 μCi of [14C]L-glutamate and unlabeled L-glutamate to make up the final concentration of 1.0 and 0.2 mM. After 20 min of incubation, oocytes were washed with ice-cold Na+-free uptake medium in which NaCl was replaced with choline-Cl. In separate experiments Na+ uptake was measured for 20 min in the uptake medium containing 20 μCi of 22Na+ and 0.2 or 1.0 mM of non-labeled L-glutamate. Intracellular pH (pHi) changes associated with EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport in oocytes were measured by monitoring pHi of oocytes using a pH-sensitive microelectrode filled with a hydrogen-selective ionophore(2Kanai Y.

Oocytes were studied 3-7 days after injection of EAAC1 cRNA or water. Briefly, Vm electrodes were pulled from 2 mm diameter fiber-filled borosilicate capillaries (Warner Instruments). These had resistances of 1-10 MΩ when back-filled with 3 M KCl. The pH electrodes were made from similar pipettes but were silanized by adding 20 μl of tri-n-butyl-chlorosilane to an enclosed container at 200°C. Pipettes were cooled under vacuum, their tips were filled with Fluka hydrogen ionophore I-mixture B, and backfilled with 0.04 M KH2PO4, 0.023 M NaOH, 0.015 M NaCl, pH 7.0. The arrangement of the electronics was as described previously (16Siebens A.W. Boron W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 90: 799-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Davis B.A. Horgan E.M. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C246-C256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Voltage due to pHj was obtained by electronically subtracting the signals from the pH and voltage electrodes. Vm was obtained by subtracting the signals from the voltage electrode and the external reference electrode. Electrometer outputs were directed to an 80386-based computer via a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter, and also to a strip chart recorder. Rates of pHi change (dpHi/dt) were determined by fitting a line to the relevant portion of the pHiversus time record. We determined the portion of dpHi/dt due to the EAAC1 transporter by subtracting the dpHi/dt obtained during a control period from the dpHi/dt obtained immediately thereafter in the presence of L-glutamate. In these experiments, the chamber was perfused with ND96, pH 7.40, followed by 100 μML-glutamate in ND96. We obtained the flux (expressed as picomole cm−2 s−1) due to the transporter by multiplying the difference dpHi/dt by the intracellular buffering power β and the surface-to-volume ratio of the oocyte. β was determined by measuring the dpHi due to the addition of 1.5% CO2, 10 mM HCO3, ND96 at pH 7.4 and had a value of 13 ± 4 mM/pH unit (n = 18)(18Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2297) Google Scholar). The surface to volume ratio was obtained from the oocyte diameter, assuming the cell is a sphere and the oocyte volume is 0.25 μl(19You G. Smith C.P. Kanai Y. Lee W.-S. Stelzner M. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The K+ dependence of the glutamate-evoked current was determined as described previously (1Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar) over a range of K+ concentrations of 0-50 mM under voltage clamp condition at holding potentials of −30 and −60 mV. Currents induced by application of 50 μM glutamate were measured in EAAC1 cRNA-injected oocytes. Oocytes expressing EAAC1 were impaled in standard ND96 medium (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and voltage-clamped. After stabilization of the current at −60 mV, oocytes were bathed in high K+/high glutamate/zero Na+ medium (98 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mML-glutamate, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). The bath solution was then replaced by high K+ medium without glutamate to observe the outward current which is due to reversed glutamate transport. After 45 s, the bathing solution was replaced by high K+/high glutamate/zero Na+ medium to terminate the reversed glutamate transport. To determine the voltage dependence of reversed transport, the outward currents were measured at holding potentials between −100 mV and +30 mV. The reversed transport of EAAC1 was also examined in voltage jump experiments (see below). Oocytes expressing EAAC1 were clamped at −50 mV, and voltage steps were applied as described below while bathed either in the high K+, 10 mM glutamate, 0 mM Na+ medium or in the high K+/0 mM glutamate, 0 mM Na+ medium. Oocytes were subjected to two-microelectrode voltage clamping and command potentials were applied and controlled by an IBM compatible computer via the software CLAMPEX from pCLAMP (version 5.5, Axon Instruments)(2Kanai Y. Stelzner M. Nussberger S. Khawaja S. Hebert S.C. Smith C.P. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20599-20606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oocyte membrane was held at −50 mV and pulsed to the test potential for 76 ms followed by a 1-s interpulse interval at the holding potential of −50 mV before next pulse. Currents were low pass-filtered at 50 kHz, digitized at 200 μs (512 samples), and saved on computer. Steady-state currents during the voltage jump were obtained by averaging the current during the final 4 ms of the 76 ms jump (average of 10 samples). Steady-state currents were measured for each test potential in the presence and absence of L-glutamate, and the glutamate-induced currents were taken as the difference between these currents. The concentration dependence of L-glutamate evoked currents at any given membrane potential and at different extracellular Na+ concentrations (Nao+)1 1The abbreviations used are: Nao+extracellular Na+ concentrationL-Gluextracellular glutamate concentration. were fitted by the Michaelis-Menten equation. Apparent KL−GLu0.5 and Imax values were calculated and plotted as a function of membrane potential. extracellular Na+ concentration extracellular glutamate concentration. The glutamate to charge flux ratio was determined by comparing the initial rate of [14C]glutamate uptake and the net charge flux calculated from the glutamate-induced inward current. We have used a similar approach to determine the Na+- to glucose-coupling ratio of the high and low affinity Na+/glucose cotransporters SGLT1 and SGLT2(14Kanai Y. Lee W.-S. You G. Brown D. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), and the H+- to peptide-coupling ratio of the oligopeptide transporter PepT1(15Fei Y.-J. Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Romero M.F. Singh S.K. Boron W.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The uptake of [14C]glutamate (20 μM) was linear over the first 5 min (Fig. 1a). The slope of this curve gave the glutamate influx, which was 293 ± 27 fmol/oocyte/s. The charge flux computed from the amplitude of the inward currents induced by application of 20 μM glutamate to oocytes injected with EAAC1 cRNA, and Faraday's constant, was 350 ± 34 fmol/oocyte/s. The holding potential used to determine the inward current for each oocyte corresponded to the steady-state potential in the presence 20 μM glutamate in the bath and was ~-38 mV. This gave a glutamate to charge flux ratio of 1: 1.19 (Fig. 1b). Transport of glutamate is therefore associated with the translocation of one net positive charge. The Na+- to glutamate-coupling ratio was initially studied by measuring the Na+ dependence of glutamate-induced currents at a holding potential of −60 mV (Fig. 2a). Curve fits of the data by the Hill equation showed that the Hill coefficients strongly depended on extracellular glutamate concentration: the Hill coefficient was 1.2 at 1.0 mM glutamate and 2.0 at 0.2 mM glutamate. At lower glutamate concentrations, the curves apparently display even larger Hill coefficients. Because the Hill coefficient depended on extracellular glutamate concentration (L-Glu0), the Na+ to glutamate coupling was reinvestigated using a different approach. Briefly, the initial rates of the [14C]glutamate and 22Na+ uptakes were directly compared. Ouabain, amiloride, and bumetanide were added to the bath to inhibit endogenous oocyte Na+ transport. Oocytes injected with EAAC1 cRNA exhibited large glutamate-induced 22Na+ uptakes (Fig. 2b). Water-injected control oocytes did not show significant 22Na+ uptake. EAAC1 mediated a low level of 22Na+ uptake in the absence of glutamate (Fig. 2b, right), which is consistent with a Na+ leak phenomenon, in analogy to that of the Na+/glucose cotransporter(20Umbach J.A. Coady M.J. Wright E.M. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1217-1224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The difference between the 22Na+ uptake obtained in the presence and absence of glutamate was taken as the glutamate-induced 22Na+ uptake (Fig. 2c). The initial rates of [14C]glutamate uptake obtained L-Glu0 of 1 and 0.2 mM were determined on the same batch of EAAC1 cRNA-injected oocytes using the approach illustrated in Fig. 1a. The rates of the 22Na+ and [14C]glutamate fluxes are compared in Fig. 2c. The ratios of the fluxes were 2.1:1 at 1.0 mML-Glu0 and 2.3:1 at 0.2 mML-Glu0. The Na+ to glutamate coupling ratio is therefore 2:1 at both 1.0 and 0.2 mML-Glu0. This indicates that the Na+ to glutamate coupling ratio does not depend on the extracellular glutamate concentration as suggested by Hill equation analysis. EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport in oocytes was associated with intracellular pH (pHi) changes as determined by monitoring the pHi of oocytes using pH-sensitive microelectrodes. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3a, application of 100 μML-glutamate to EAAC1 cRNA-injected oocytes caused pHi to decrease from 7.58 to 7.50 and the oocyte membrane to depolarize. A similar result was obtained using L-aspartate as a substrate, whereas leucine which is not a substrate of EAAC1 did not result in intracellular acidification. On average, the application of 100 μML-glutamate elicited a dpHj/dt of −10.0 ± 1.1 × 10−5 pH units/s and a depolarization of 39.8 ± 2.4 mV (n = 25). These values allow the calculation of the OH−/H+ to charge coupling (Fig. 3b). The changes in pH and the membrane depolarization were converted to currents by the following equations: IOH−/H+ = [dpHi/dt] ×β× F × z, and IV = ΔVm/Roocyte, where F is the Faraday constant, β the buffering power (15 mM/pH unit), z = 1, and Roocyte the input resistance of an oocyte which was (1 MΩ). Assuming an oocyte volume of 0.25 μl, the result is an estimated OH−/H+ to charge coupling of 0.9 ± 0.1:1. These values indicate that transport of 1 L-glutamate molecule is associated with the cotransport of either 1 H+ ion or the countertransport of 1 OH− ion. Extracellular K+ inhibited glutamate-induced currents in voltage-clamped oocytes injected with EAAC1 cRNA, as previously reported(1Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3c, the inhibition is compared at −60 and −30 mV. It is greater at −30 mV than at −60 mV, consistent with K+ countertransport. Using the two-electrode voltage clamp method the reversed operation of EAAC1 was observed as an outward current. This was achieved in the presence of high extracellular K+ and by eliminating extracellular Na+. In control experiments, glutamate-evoked inward currents were observed when using the high Na+ and low K+ solution in the perfusate (Fig. 4a). In the experiments addressing reversed glutamate transport, it was assumed that the intracellular glutamate concentration in oocytes is ~10 mM, in analogy to neurons(21Nicholls D. Attwell D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 462-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), and the experiment was therefore started by counter-inhibition with 10 mML-Glu0 (Fig. 4b). Removal of glutamate resulted in a significant outward current, due to efflux of glutamate driven by the outwardly directed electrochemical gradients of Na+ and glutamate. In support of this interpretation, the outward current was enhanced by depolarization (Fig. 4b). No significant currents were observed in water-injected control oocytes. Fig. 4c shows the current-voltage relationship determined by stepping the voltage between −150 and +50 mV. The figure further confirms that the current is strongly enhanced by depolarization. This approach was used to study the presteady-state and steady-state characteristics of EAAC1 in response to voltage jumps and to determine the kinetic parameters of EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport as a function of membrane potential. In contrast to the Na+/glucose cotransporter SGLT1(9Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), no significant presteady-state currents were observed in oocytes expressing rabbit EAAC1 in the presence of Nao+ and in the absence of L-Glu0 (data not shown). A similar lack of presteady-state currents was observed for human EAAC1 (2Kanai Y. Stelzner M. Nussberger S. Khawaja S. Hebert S.C. Smith C.P. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20599-20606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The I-V curves for the currents evoked by L-glutamate in the concentration range of 1 μM-1 mM demonstrated that the currents do not reverse between −150 to + 50 mV (Fig. 5). The currents saturated with hyperpolarization only at L-Glu0 below 40 μM whereas there was no saturation at higher L-Glu0. Apparent KL-GLU0.5 and Imax values obtained at different extracellular Na+ (Nao+) concentrations were plotted as a function of membrane potential (Fig. 6). As previously observed for human EAAC1, the KL-GLU0.5 and Imax values determined at 100 mM Nao+ both increase with membrane hyperpolarization (Fig. 6)(2Kanai Y. Stelzner M. Nussberger S. Khawaja S. Hebert S.C. Smith C.P. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20599-20606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have determined the voltage dependence of KL-GLUTAMATE0.5 and Imax at reduced Nao+. Fig. 6a shows that re-ducing extracellular Na+ reverses the voltage dependence of KL-GLU0.5ation. The structure-function analysis of transport proteins requires knowledge of their transport mechanisms and the molecular rearrangements that occur during the transport process. Site-directed mutagenesis has been a highly valuable approach in elucidating the structure-function relationship of ion channels. The success of these studies was enhanced by the availability of functional models describing the transport process and the associated molecular events. These models were introduced by Hodgkin, Huxley, and Katz and were further refined by several investigators (see Ref. 22Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates Inc. Publishers, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar for review). To embark on structure-function analysis of ion-coupled solute transporters, the availability of such models would be useful. To this end, we performed a detailed analysis of the coupling stoichiometry and transport kinetics of rabbit EAAC1, and we discuss a hypothetical kinetic model of EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport. The studies presented in Fig. 1 reveal a glutamate to charge flux ratio of 1: 1.19 and demonstrate that one net positive charge is translocated with each glutamate molecule. Although the stoichiometry of Na+-coupled transporters is commonly determined based on the Hill equation (see Ref. 23Hediger M.A. Rhoads D.B. Physiol. Review. 1994; 74: 993-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), this approach did not yield reliable information on the coupling stoichiometry of EAAC1. Similar problems were encountered when using this approach for the determination of the stoichiometry of the Na+/glucose cotransporter SGLT1(24Lee W.-S. Kanai Y. Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12032-12039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the Na+ to glutamate coupling ratio was determined by comparing the initial rates of 22Na+ and [14C]glutamate uptake. The Na+ to glutamate coupling ratio was close to 2:1 at extracellular glutamate concentrations of either 1 or 0.2 mM. EAAC1-mediated transport was furthermore associated with a decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) (Fig. 3a). The OH− or H+ to charge coupling ratio was estimated from the rate of pHi decrease. This calculation depends on the assumed oocyte volume of 0.25 μl(19You G. Smith C.P. Kanai Y. Lee W.-S. Stelzner M. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), an oocyte membrane resistance of 1 MΩ and a buffering power (β) of 15 mM/pH unit(18Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2297) Google Scholar). The computed coupling ratio of 0.9 ± 0.1 is consistent with a 1:1 ratio for the H+/OH− to charge stoichiometry. Taken together, these data give an overall stoichiometry of 1 glutamate: 2 Na+: 1 OH−/H+: 1 charge. Since we also demonstrated that transport mediated by EAAC1 depends on K+ and since Attwell and colleagues (8Bouvier M. Szatkowski M. Amato A. Attwell D. Nature. 1992; 360: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) proposed that high affinity glutamate transport is coupled to the counter transport of OH− or other pH-changing ions such as HCO3−, and not to the cotransport of H+, we infer that EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport is coupled to the cotransport of 2 Na+ ions and the countertransport of 1 OH− (or HCO3−) ion and 1 K+ ion. This stoichiometry is unlike that proposed by Stoffel and colleagues (25Kloeckner U. Storck T. Conradt M. Stoffel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14594-14596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the glial glutamate transporter GLAST. Based on Hill equation analysis, these investigators suggested that GLAST is coupled to the cotransport of three Na+-ions. The overall stoichiometry of EAAC1, however, corresponds to that prop"

We have reported that a catalytic amount of MMP-3 (stromelysin 1) activates pro-MMP-9 (Ogata, Y., Enghild, J. J., and Nagase, H.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3581-3584). To activate pro-MMP-9 in the complex, however, an excess molar amount of MMP-3 is required to saturate the TIMP-1 in the complex. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the requirement for excess MMP-3 can be circumvented by specific destruction of TIMP-1 by non-target proteinases. We have tested trypsin, plasmin, cathepsin G, neutrophil elastase, and chymotrypsin as possible inactivators of TIMP-1 and found that neutrophil elastase inactivates TIMP-1 in the complex without significant destruction of pro-MMP-9. Once TIMP-1 is inactivated, pro-MMP-9 can be readily activated by a catalytic amount of MMP-3. These results suggest that neutrophil elastase may participate in connective tissue destruction at the inflammatory sites not only by its direct action on matrix macromolecules but also by rendering pro-MMP-9 in the pro-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex activable by MMP-3 as well as activating pro-MMP-3.

MMP-9, like other MMPs, is secreted from cells as an inactive zymogen (pro-MMP-9). Thus, activation of pro-MMP-9 is one of the key steps involved in control of its enzymic activity in the extracellular space. Pro-MMP-9 consists of a propeptide domain, a catalytic domain that contains the zinc-binding HEXXHXXGX XH motif, three repeats of fibronectin type II-like domain and type V collagen-like domain, and a C-terminal hemopexin/vitronectin-like domain(1Woessner Jr., J.F.

The treatment of pro-MMP-9 with trypsin and 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) activates the zymogen, but a most likely candidate of pro-MMP-9 activator in vivo is thought to be MMP-3 (stromelysin 1)(21Ogata Y.

Chem. 1992; 267: 21712-21719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the recent finding that pro-MMP-9 forms a specific complex with an endogenous MMP inhibitor, TIMP-1(16Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has introduced complexity in the activation of pro-MMP-9 by MMP-3. TIMP-1 binds non-covalently to pro-MMP-9 through the C-terminal domains of the two molecules(22Goldberg G.I. Strongin A. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Marmer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4519-4583Google Scholar, 24Murphy G. Houbrechts A. Cockett M.I. Williamson R.A. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8097-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal domain, which has inhibitory activity, is exposed for interaction with other active MMPs. Therefore, the activation of pro-MMP-9 in the complex by MMP-3 requires more than a molar stoichiometric amount of MMP-3 or blockage of the TIMP-1 by other MMPs.2 2Ogata, Y., Itoh, Y., and Nagase, H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, in press. In this communication, we report another possible mechanism by which pro-MMP-9 in the complex may become readily activable by MMP-3. This results from a specific inactivation of TIMP-1 in the complex by human neutrophil elastase (HNE). This observation, together with the ability of HNE to activate MMP-3 from its precursor(25Nagase H. Enghild J.J. Suzuki K. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5783-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), suggests that HNE plays a key role in tissue destruction in inflammatory sites in vivo. APMA, Brij 35, diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (Dip-F), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), trypsin (bovine), chymotrypsin (bovine), plasminogen (human), urokinase (human), and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-(sheep IgG) IgG were from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), antibiotics, fetal calf serum (FCS), Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), and lactalbumin hydrolysate were from Life Technologies, Inc. Human fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. HNE and human neutrophil cathepsin G were from Athens Research Technology Inc. Human pro-MMP-3 was purified from the culture medium of rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts and activated as described previously(25Nagase H. Enghild J.J. Suzuki K. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5783-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Human pro-MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase) was purified from the medium of the TPA-treated U-937 cells according to Suzuki et al.(26Suzuki K. Enghild J.J. Morodomi T. Salvesen G. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10261-10270Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Pro-MMP-1 was activated with plasmin and MMP-3, and MMP-3 and plasmin were removed by chromatography on anti-MMP-3 IgG coupled to Affi-Gel 10 and Sephacryl S-200, respectively. TIMP-1 was purified from the medium of U-937 cells(27Morodomi T. Ogata Y. Sasaguri Y. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Antiserum against human pro-MMP-9 and reduced TIMP-1 were raised in sheep using purified antigens as described previously(28Okada Y. Takeuchi N. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Nagase H. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1989; 48: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Both antisera were shown to be specific by Western blotting analysis using the concentrated crude culture medium of HT-1080 cells. HT-1080 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS. After confluency the cells were washed with HBSS and treated with TPA (20 ng/ml) in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.2% lactalbumin hydrolysate for 2 days. This conditioned medium was harvested and used for purification of the pro-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex. Pro-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex was purified from conditioned medium of HT-1080 cells. First, culture medium was passed through a column of gelatin-Sepharose 4B equilibrated with TNC buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH. 7.5), 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3). The column was washed with the same buffer, and the enzyme was subsequently eluted with the same buffer containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide. The eluted protein was pooled, dialyzed against TNC buffer, concentrated with an Amicon YM-10 membrane, and subjected to gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-300. The protein peak containing pro-MMP-9 was mostly a complex with TIMP-1. Fractions from the front edge of the peak were pooled as the pro-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex. All enzyme assays were carried out in TNC buffer containing 0.05% Brij 35. The collagenolytic activity of MMP-1 was measured using 14C-acetylated type I collagen (guinea pig) according to the method of Cawston and Barret(29Cawston T.E. Barrett A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 was measured using heat-denatured 14C-acetylated type I collagen (guinea pig)(30Harris Jr., E.D. Krane S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 258: 566-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). One unit of collagenolytic and gelatinolytic activity degraded 1 μg of collagen or gelatin per min at 37°C. TIMP activity was measured against the 41-kDa MMP-1. Various concentrations of the samples were incubated with a constant amount of MMP-1 at 37°C for 30 min, and residual collagenolytic activity was measured against 14C-acetylated type I collagen (guinea pig). The amount of the 41-kDa MMP-1 and the 45-kDa MMP-3 was determined by titration with TIMP-1. The amount of the pro-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex was determined by titration of the TIMP-1 in the complex with MMP-1 or MMP-3, assuming the molar ratio of pro-MMP-9 to TIMP-1 in the complex is 1:1. Western blotting analysis was carried out as described previously(31Ito A. Nagase H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Sheep anti-(human MMP-9) IgG was used as a primary antibody at a concentration of 5 μg/ml and sheep anti-(human TIMP-1) serum at a 1:1000 dilution, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-(sheep IgG) IgG was used for a secondary antibody. Zymography was conducted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing gelatin (0.8 mg/ml) as described previously(27Morodomi T. Ogata Y. Sasaguri Y. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Enzymic activity was visualized as negative staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Five different proteinases (bovine trypsin, bovine chymotrypsin, HNE, human cathepsin G, and human plasmin) were tested for their ability to inactivate the TIMP-1 component of the pro-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex. The treatment of the complex with trypsin, HNE, and chymotrypsin diminished apparent TIMP-1 activity in a time-dependent manner, but plasmin or cathepsin G had little effect (Fig. 1). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis of the pro-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex after treatment with these proteinases showed that only HNE degraded TIMP-1 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2). HNE also cleaved some of the pro-MMP-9, but the amount was low in comparison with TIMP-1 degradation. The degradation products of TIMP-1 had molecular masses of 17 and 16 kDa, identical to those of TIMP-1 treated with HNE. The degradation rates of TIMP-1 in the complex and that of free TIMP-1 were almost identical. Although the treatment with trypsin and chymotrypsin also diminished the TIMP-1 activity of the complex, Western blotting analyses indicated that the TIMP-1 molecule was intact. Instead, pro-MMP-9 was processed into lower molecular weight species. TIMP-1, when not bound to pro-MMP-9, is susceptible to degradation by trypsin or chymotrypsin(32Okada Y. Watanabe S. Nakanishi I. Kishi J. Hayakawa T. Watorek W. Travis J. Nagase H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 229: 157-160Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar), but both enzymes activate pro-MMP-9(23Okada Y. Gonoji Y. Naka K. Tomita K.

J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of MMP inhibitory activity of TIMP-1 in the complex after trypsin or chymotrypsin treatment is likely to result from the formation of the complex through the inhibitory site of TIMP-1 and active site of activated MMP-9, so that the TIMP-1 molecule is no longer available to inhibit other MMPs (MMP-1 in Fig. 1). To verify this, the trypsin or chymotrypsin-treated complex was applied to an anti-TIMP-1 affinity column. The complex, after treatment with trypsin (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37°C, exhibited no TIMP activity, whereas the complex, after treatment with chymotrypsin (10 μg/ml) for 4 h, retained about 34% TIMP activity. However, no gelatinolytic activity was detected in either case (data not shown). Application of these samples to the anti-(TIMP-1) IgG-Affi-Gel 10 column indicated that all low molecular weight species of MMP-9 generated by trypsin or chymotrypsin bound to the column and eluted with 6 M urea together with TIMP-1 (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the activated MMP-9 formed a complex with TIMP-1 through the catalytic site of the enzyme and the N-terminal inhibitory domain of the inhibitor. Plasmin and cathepsin G had very little effect on TIMP-1 and pro-MMP-9.Figure 2:Western blotting analysis of the pro-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex treated with proteinases.

This was due to the inhibition of MMP-3 by TIMP-1 of the complex. A very small amount of pro-MMP-9 was converted to an intermediate 86-kDa form after incubation with a 0.5 molar ratio of MMP-3 for 24 h (Fig. 4). This species is an initial product of MMP-9 generated by MMP-3, but it does not have enzymic activity(21Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3581-3584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the HNE-treated complex was incubated with a catalytic amount of MMP-3, pro-MMP-9 was activated in a time- and a dose-dependent manner. The level of pro-MMP-9 activation was dependent on the degree of TIMP-1 degradation by HNE (, Fig. 4). After a 4-h treatment with HNE, about 30% of TIMP-1 activity was left (Fig. 1). Under these conditions, the addition of a 0.2 molar ratio of MMP-3 to the complex did not activate pro-MMP-9, but a 0.5 molar ratio proportion of MMP-3 did activate the zymogen generating the fully active 82-kDa form (Fig. 4). The lack of activation at a 0.2 molar ratio of MMP-3 can be attributed to the inhibition of MMP-3 by the intact TIMP-1 that was present in the complex. After incubation of the complex with HNE for 8 h, residual TIMP-1 activity was 15% of the original, and a 0.2 molar amount of MMP-3 was able to activate the complex. The maximal activity of MMP-9 detected was about 75% of that generated by treatment of the complex with HNE for 4 or 8 h. A decrease in MMP-9 activity after incubation with a 0.5 molar ratio of MMP-3 at 37°C for a longer incubation time was due to degradation of MMP-9 either by autolysis or by MMP-3.Table I:Expression of gelatinolytic activity in the pro-MMP-9 · TIMP-1 complex treated with HNE by catalytic amount of MMP-3 Open table in a new tab Pro-MMP-9 is activated in vitro by treatment with mercurial compounds, SDS as demonstrated by SDS-containing gelatin zymography, and trypsin. Morodomi et al.(27Morodomi T. Ogata Y. Sasaguri Y. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) reported that pro-MMP-9 can be activated by a relatively high concentration (10 μg/ml) of cathepsin G and plasmin, but the levels of activation were 22-30% and 10%, respectively, while Okada et al.(23Okada Y. Gonoji Y. Naka K. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21712-21719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported more effective activation by these enzymes. Nonetheless, the most likely activator of pro-MMP-9 in vivo is MMP-3 since a catalytic amount of MMP-3 is sufficient to activate this zymogen (21-23). MMP-3 processed the propeptide of pro-MMP-9 in a stepwise manner by initially cleaving the Glu40-Met41 bond and then the Arg87-Phe88 bond for complete removal of the propeptide(21Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3581-3584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this action of MMP-3 is readily inhibited when pro-MMP-9 binds to TIMP-1(22Goldberg G.I. Strongin A. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Marmer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4519-4583Google Scholar). This is evident from the relatively high affinity between TIMP-1 and MMP-3 as shown by the Ki value of 0.1 nM and kon value of 1.9 × 106M−1 s−1(33Nguyen Q. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2089-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Pro-MMP-9 was found as a complex in the conditioned medium of HT-1080 cells, U937 cells, H-Ras-transformed human fibroblasts, and human alveolar macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharide(34Welgus H.G. Campbell E.J. Curry J.D. Eisen A.Z. Senior R.M. Wilheim S.M. Goldberg G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). When these complexes are treated with APMA or trypsin, pro-MMP-9 in the complex is processed to an active species, but it is readily inhibited by TIMP-1 in the complex.2 MMP-3 is unable to activate pro-MMP-9 in the complex unless TIMP-1 is saturated with an active MMP.2 TIMP-1, on the other hand, can be proteolytically inactivated by a number of non-target proteinases such as HNE and trypsin(32Okada Y. Watanabe S. Nakanishi I. Kishi J. Hayakawa T. Watorek W. Travis J. Nagase H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 229: 157-160Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this report, we have demonstrated that HNE preferentially cleaves TIMP-1 and inactivates the inhibitor without affecting the integrity of pro-MMP-9 significantly. The action of HNE on TIMP-1 in the complex is probably on the Val69-Cys70 bond3 3H. Nagase, T. E. Cawston, and K. Brew, manuscript in preparation. in the N-terminal domain of the inhibitor as SDS-PAGE analysis of the HNE-treated complex and free TIMP-1 showed fragments with the same molecular masses. After treatment of the complex with the HNE, a catalytic amount of MMP-3 activated pro-MMP-9. After a longer incubation time (e.g. 24 h), less activity of MMP-9 was detected. This resulted from the degradation of the activated MMP-9, possibly by MMP-3. A similar observation was reported recently by Shapiro et al.(35Shapiro S.D. Fliszar C.J. Broekelmann T.J. Mecham R.P. Senior R.M. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6351-6356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although trypsin inactivates TIMP-1 by degrading it into several fragments (data not shown), it did not destroy TIMP-1 in the pro-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex (Fig. 2). Under the experimental conditions that we employed, trypsin preferentially activates the zymogen, which in turn binds to the inhibitory site of TIMP-1. It is notable that TIMP-1, in this complex, is resistant to proteolysis by trypsin, suggesting that the trypsin cleavage sites in TIMP-1 are protected by MMP-9. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that HNE preferentially inactivates TIMP-1 in the pro-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex and renders pro-MMP-9 activable by MMP-3. Shifts of the balance between proteinases and proteinase inhibitors produced by the inactivation of proteinase inhibitors by non-target enzymes are an important consideration in tissue destruction. Examples of this are described for a number of serpins, which are inactivated by bacterial proteinases(36Morihara K. Tsuzuki H. Harada M. Iwata T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 37Potempa J. Watorek W. Travis J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 14748-14751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and MMPs(39Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. Suzuki K. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15810-15816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study suggests that HNE may play an important role in connective tissue destruction under inflammatory conditions not only by its direct action on connective tissue matrix components but also by converting pro-MMP-3 to active MMP-3 (25Nagase H. Enghild J.J. Suzuki K. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5783-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and rendering pro-MMP-9 activable by the selective destruction of TIMP-1. The activated MMPs through these mechanisms may further accelerate tissue damage by their direct action on the matrix as well as inactivation of the endogenous elastase inhibitor, α1-proteinase inhibitor(39Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. Suzuki K. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15810-15816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The complex (20 μg/ml) was treated with HNE (5 μg/ml) for indicated periods. After inactivation of HNE by 2 mM Dip-F, the samples were incubated with 0.2 or 0.5 molar ratio of MMP-3 at 37°C for indicated periods of time. MMP-9 activity was measured using 14C-labeled guinea pig type I gelatin. We thank Dr. Keith Brew for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2004790690,"Excitatory synaptic activity in horizontal stratum oriens-alveus interneurons (OAIs) is driven by the recurrent collaterals of CA1 pyramidal cells and is strongly influenced by protocols that elicit synaptic plasticity in these principal neurons. Induction of LTD in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal neuron synapse causes a passive down-regulation of stratum radiatum-evoked excitatory synaptic responses onto OAIs. In addition, we show that the strength of the temporoammonic input to the CA1 pyramidal neuron distal dendrites is regulated by OAI activity. The passive propagation of LTD to OAIs consequently disinhibits the direct entorhinal cortex-CA1 input, resulting in an enhanced excitation of CA1 pyramidal neurons by a mechanism not requiring activation of the trisynaptic pathway."

No IL-1RI mutants were found that can activate NF-κB in the absence of IRAK activity. Therefore, we propose that IRAK activation is a necessary step in the activation of NF-κB by IL-1."
https://openalex.org/W2024530071,"The acetylcholine receptor from vertebrate skeletal muscle is a pentamer of homologous subunits with composition alpha 2 beta gamma delta. Its two ligand binding sites, formed at alpha-gamma and alpha-delta interfaces, differ in their affinities for agonists and competitive antagonists, owing to different contributions of the gamma and delta subunits. To identify portions of the gamma and delta subunits that contribute to the binding sites, the experiments described here use gamma-delta subunit chimeras and site-specific mutants to determine the basis of the 10,000-fold selectivity of conotoxin M1 for the sites. Three distinct regions of the extracellular domain were found to contribute to conotoxin M1 selectivity, each containing a single residue responsible for the contribution of that region. Residues K34, S111, and F172 of the gamma subunit confer low affinity to the alpha-gamma binding site, whereas the corresponding residues of the delta subunit, S36, Y113, and I178, confer high affinity to the alpha-delta site. Identification of three separate determinants of ligand selectivity suggests a limited model of the folding pattern of the extracellular domain of the subunits."

We used an antisense oligonucleotide to inhibit induction of spot 14 protein by T3 and glucose in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes to test the hypothesis that the protein could function in the regulation of lipid synthesis. Spot 14 protein was undetectable in hepatocytes maintained in 5.5 mM glucose without T3, and was induced within 4 h after addition of 27.5 mM glucose and 50 nM T3 to the culture medium, reaching a maximal level within 24 h. Accumulation of spot 14 protein was markedly inhibited in hepatocytes transfected with a spot 14 antisense oligonucleotide, but not in those treated with a control oligonucleotide. Transfection of the antisense, but not control, oligonucleotide also abrogated the increase in lipogenesis induced by T3 and glucose. Reduced triglyceride formation accounted for the diminished net lipid synthesis. In contrast to lipogenesis, glucose uptake was not significantly affected by the transfections. Antisense transfection inhibited the induction of both ATP-citrate lyase and fatty acid synthase immunoreactivities, as well as malic enzyme activity, indicating that the observed reduction in lipogenesis could be explained by diminished cellular content of lipogenic enzymes.

Cells were placed in modified William's E medium without antibiotics 5 h after plating. Some media contained 8 μg/ml Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 4 μM phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (Oligos Etc, Wilsonville, OR). Oligonucleotides employed were “S14” (GCGTTTCGTTAGCACTTGC; an antisense sequence of which the 3’ residue corresponds to the “G” of the ATG translational start codon of the rat spot 14 mRNA sequence(16Liaw C.

Oligonucleotides (2 μM, without Lipofectin) were also added to transfected cultures. Cells were harvested 24 h later. Rat H4IIE hepatoma cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were grown to confluence in the same media and transfected with the oligonucleotides described above in a control experiment. Affinity-purified rabbit anti-glutathione S-transferase-spot 14 fusion protein IgG was employed as reported previously(14Kinlaw W.B. Tron P. Friedmann A.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 3120-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), except that a protein A-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) was used for detection (1:5000 dilution). Western blot detection of rat ATP-citrate lyase and fatty acid synthase was as described(13Kinlaw W.B. Tron P. Witters L.A. Endocrinolology. 1993; 133: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), employing affinity-purified goat IgG preparations (kindly supplied by L. Witters, Dartmouth Medical School). Band intensities were quantified by computer-assisted videodensitometry. Hepatocytes or hepatoma cells were placed in fresh media containing appropriate glucose, T3, oligonucleotides, and either tritiated water (Sigma; 60 μCi/ml) or 1-[14C]acetate (Sigma; 20.8 mCi/mmol, 4 μCi/ml) for an additional 60 or 180 min, respectively, prior to harvest. Preliminary studies showed that incorporation of radioactivity from these compounds was linear at those time points. Total lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer(17Bligh E. Dyer W. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar). Extracts were chromatographed on silica gel plates using petroleum ether:ethyl ether:acetic acid (80:19:1). Radioactive lipids were visualized by autoradiography, and identities were assigned to the labeled lipids by their comigration with nonradioactive standards. The protein concentration was determined on an aliquot of each sample prior to extraction using the method of Wadell(18Waddell W.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1956; 48: 311-315PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes transfected as described above were incubated in the presence of 1-[14C]2-deoxyglucose (Sigma; 57 mCi/mmol, 0.5 μCi/ml) for 30 min. Preliminary experiments showed linear uptake of this compound over a 60-min period. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then suspended in 1.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The same procedure used for extraction of lipids was then employed, except the aqueous phase was retained, dried in a stream of air, resuspended in 60 μl of water, and analyzed by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. Malic enzyme activity was determined in total cellular protein by the method of Hsu and Lardy (19Hsu R. Lardy H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 520-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Differences between means were assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA(21Wilkinson L. Hill M. Vang E. SYSTAT: Statistics, Version 5.2 Edition. SYSTAT, Inc., Evanston, IL1992: 724Google Scholar)). Western analysis of the time course of induction of spot 14 protein after addition of 50 nM T3 and increased glucose (from 5.5 to 27.5 mM) to the hepatocyte culture medium is shown in Fig. 1. On blots loaded with 400 μg of total protein per lane, spot 14 protein was undetectable initially, became visible within 4 h, and was maximally induced within 1 day. The effect of antisense transfection on spot 14 protein expression is shown in Fig. 2. The protein was not detectable in hepatocytes maintained in 5.5 mM glucose without T3 after 72 h in culture (lanes 1 and 2). Accumulation of spot 14 protein was observed after 48 h exposure to T3 and 27.5 mM glucose (lanes 3-6). This was not inhibited by either mock transfection (lanes 7-10) or transfection of the preproinsulin I oligonucleotide (lanes 15-18). Treatment with the spot 14 antisense oligonucleotide, however, resulted in a nearly complete inhibition of induction of the protein (lanes 11-14). Neither the yield of protein/culture dish nor trypan blue exclusion were reduced in antisense-treated plates. We assessed the impact of antisense transfection on lipid metabolism in hepatocytes labeled with tritiated water. Transfection of the antisense oligonucleotide reduced the incorporation of this label to 57% of that observed in cells mock transfected with Lipofectin alone (p < 0.05), a value not statistically different from that observed in cells maintained in 5.5 mM glucose without T3 (Fig. 3a). Incorporation in cells treated with the preproinsulin I oligonucleotide yielded rates not significantly different (p > 0.05) from that observed in mock-transfected cells. As was the case in tritium-labeled hepatocytes, the T3- and glucose-induced increment in lipid labeling from acetate was also abrogated by transfection of the spot 14 antisense sequence (p < 0.05, Fig. 3b). Reduced transport of glucose from the culture medium into the hepatocytes could explain the reduced lipogenesis in antisense-transfected cells. We therefore assessed the impact of the treatments on uptake of [14C]2-deoxyglucose by hepatocytes (Fig. 3c). In contrast to lipid synthesis, none of the transfected groups exhibited significant differences in the uptake of the glucose analog. Thin layer chromatograpic separation of 14C-labeled lipids revealed that triglyceride was the predominant lipid synthesized by the hepatocytes (data not shown). Analysis of equal amounts of radioactive lipids showed no major difference in the relative incorporation of label into triglycerides, free fatty acids, or cholesterol in antisense, as opposed to control-transfected cells. Diminished formation of triglyceride therefore accounted for the bulk of the reduced incorporation of radioactivity into total lipids caused by the antisense oligonucleotide. The rat H4IIE hepatoma cell line does not express detectable spot 14 mRNA or protein in response to T3 and 27.5 mM glucose. These cells also did not exhibit a significant increase in lipid labeling from [14C]acetate 48 h after the transition from 5.5 mM glucose to 27.5 mM glucose plus 50 nM T3 (low, 9.8 ± 1.4; high, 11.0 ± 1.8 nmol incorporated/90 min/μg, mean ± S.D., n = 6 plates/group, p = 0.18). We measured lipid synthesis in H4IIE cells transfected with the spot 14 or preproinsulin I antisense oligonucleotides to further control for potential nonspecific metabolic effects of the treatments. No significant differences in mean rates of lipid labeling from [14C]acetate among the groups were observed in these cells (data are mean ± S.D., nanamole/90 min/μg, 6 plates/group): 27.5 mM glucose and 50 nM T3 alone, 8.0 ± 0.6; plus mock transfection, 6.4 ± 1.8; plus transfection of the spot 14 antisense oligonucleotide, 6.4 ± 1.2; plus transfection of the preproinsulin I oligonucleotide 7.0 ± 1.2). We wished to determine whether reduced lipid synthesis in antisense-treated hepatocytes resulted from diminished expression of lipogenic enzymes. Western analysis showed that the cellular content of ATP-citrate lyase was induced by treatment of hepatocytes with T3 and 27.5 mM glucose, and that this was significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited by transfection with the antisense, but not the control, oligonucleotide (Fig. 4). A similar result was observed for fatty acid synthase (Fig. 5). Induction of malic enzyme activity was also significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited by exposure to the antisense, but not the control, oligonucleotide (Fig. 6).Figure 5:Induction of fatty acid synthase immunoreactivity is inhibited by a spot 14 antisense oligonucleotide. A Western blot of total cellular protein (50 μg/lane) from individual plates of hepatocytes treated as described in the legend toFig. 2 was probed with an antibody directed against rat fatty acid synthase. The arrow indicates the position of the 265 kDa enzyme. Intensities of the fatty acid synthase bands were: low, 1.29* ± 1.41; high, 8.08 ± 3.45; Lipofectin only, 9.63 ± 1.78; antisense, 1.89* ± 0.81; preproinsulin I, 10.40 ± 1.63 (mean ± S.D.; * indicates different from other groups, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6:Malic enzyme induction by T3 and glucose is inhibited by antisense transfection.

Densitometric quantitation of autoradiographs, normalized to the intensity of actin signals seen on reprobing of the blots, indicated that expression of malic enzyme mRNA was significantly reduced in the antisense, as opposed to preproinsulin I-transfected cells. Optical densities of the malic enzyme bands were 1.0 ± 0.03 in preproinsulin I, and 0.39 ± 0.21 in antisense-treated groups (mean S.D., n = 4/group, p < 0.05). The correlative data cited in the introduction led to the association of spot 14 mRNA expression and the lipogenic activities of liver, white and brown adipose, and lactating mammary tissues. The association rested on multiple examples of concordant regulation of the mRNA and lipogenic rates in those tissues by various stimuli in both the intact animal and cultured cells. Our demonstration that the regulation of the spot 14 protein was as rapid and marked as that of the mRNA(22Kinlaw W.B. Ling N.C. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19779-19783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that the protein co-localized with lipogenic enzymes within the hepatic lobule (13Kinlaw W.B. Tron P. Witters L.A. Endocrinolology. 1993; 133: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) extended the association to the level of the protein itself. Immunohistochemical detection of the protein in hepatic nuclei further prompted the hypothesis that the spot 14 protein could be involved in the regulation of the lipogenic pathway at the level of gene expression(14Kinlaw W.B. Tron P. Friedmann A.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 3120-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the current studies transfection of a phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide allowed us to directly assess the metabolic consequences of inhibition of spot 14 protein induction in T3- and glucose-stimulated hepatocytes. Our major observation was the inhibition of glucose- and T3-induced lipogenesis in antisense-transfected hepatocytes. In order to understand the inhibitory effect of antisense transfection on lipid formation, we used available antibodies to analyze the cellular content of both ATP-citrate lyase and fatty acid synthase. In both cases, inhibition of enzyme induction by the antisense, but not the control, oligonucleotide was observed. Others have shown that the expression of these enzymes is regulated at the pretranslational level(23Elshourbagy N.A. Near J.C. Kmetz P.J. Sathe G.M. Southan C. Strickler J.E. Gross M. Young J.F.

Chem. 1989; 264: 574-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the lyase also exhibits insulin-induced serine phosphorylation(25Yu K. Benjamin W. Ramakrishna S. Khalaf N. Czech M. Biochem. J. 1989; 268: 539-545Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We observed a similar inhibition of induction of the activity of malic enzyme, which is also known to be regulated at the pretranslational level(26Magnuson M.A. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12712-12717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this enzyme is not believed to be rate-determining for de novo long chain fatty acid synthesis, its well characterized regulation by T3 and glucose rendered it attractive as a representative lipogenic enzyme. In view of our previous demonstration of immunostaining of hepatic nuclei with antibodies directed against a spot 14 fusion protein(14Kinlaw W.B. Tron P. Friedmann A.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 3120-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and our current observation of reduced malic enzyme mRNA expression in antisense-treated hepatocytes, we hypothesize that the metabolic effects of the spot 14 antisense knockout were mediated at the pretranslational level. Our previous comparison of the time course of accumulation of malic enzyme mRNA and spot 14 protein in rat liver following T3 injection was also consistent with this formulation(20Strait K.A. Kinlaw W.B. Mariash C.N. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19784-19789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to lipogenesis, antisense transfection had no significant impact on glucose uptake. This observation had two major implications. The first was that the spot 14 antisense oligomer did not nonspecifically injure the cells with resultant inhibition of either the facilitated transport of glucose or its energy-dependent phosphorylation. The second was that diminished availability of glucose from the culture medium did not underlie the observed reduction in lipid formation in antisense-treated cells. Fractional turnover of modified oligonucleotides such as those employed in this study is markedly reduced compared to that of unmodified single-stranded DNA in tissue culture(27Campbell J.M. Bacon T. Wickstrom E. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1990; 20: 259Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The possibility of nonspecific effects requires consideration. The starkly contrasting effects of the antisense and control oligonucleotides on both the expression of spot 14 protein and on lipid formation, as assessed by incorporation of two different radioactive precursors, assured us of the specificity of the effect of the antisense oligomer on these variables. This conclusion was further supported by the observation that H4IIE cells, a line derived from the same organ and species as the hepatocytes that does not express detectable spot 14 mRNA or protein, did not exhibit any differential effects of the oligonucleotides on lipid synthesis. The metabolic impact of antisense transfection was therefore dependent on both the sequence of the oligonucleotide and the presence of the intended target sequence within the transfected cell. Taken together, the data indicate that spot 14 protein functions in the transduction of hormone- and substrate-initiated signals for lipid metabolism in hepatocytes. Transcriptional activation of the spot 14 gene by thyroid hormone (28Zilz N.D. Murray M.B. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8136-8143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glucose metabolism(29Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2110374497,"Calcium depletion from the endoplasmic reticulum inhibits protein synthesis and correlates with increased phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2α) by a mechanism that does not require ongoing protein synthesis. To elucidate whether protein synthesis inhibition requires eIF-2α phosphorylation and whether eIF-2α phosphorylation is mediated by the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), we studied protein synthesis in response to calcium depletion mediated by calcium ionophore A23187 in cell lines overexpressing wild-type eIF-2α, a mutant eIF-2α (S51A) that is resistant to phosphorylation, or a dominant negative mutant PKR (K296P in catalytic subdomain II). Expression of either mutant eIF-2α or mutant PKR partially protected NIH3T3 cells from inhibition of protein synthesis upon A23187 treatment. In contrast, overexpression of wild-type PKR increased sensitivity to protein synthesis inhibition mediated by A23187 treatment. In a COS-1 monkey cell transient transfection system, increased eIF-2α phosphorylation in response to A23187 treatment was inhibited by expression of the dominant negative PKR mutant. Overexpression of the PKR regulatory RNA binding domain, independent of the PKR catalytic domain, was sufficient to inhibit increased phosphorylation of eIF-2α upon A23187 treatment. In addition, overexpression of the HIV TAR RNA binding protein also inhibited eIF-2α phosphorylation upon A23187 treatment. Taken together, our data show that calcium depletion activates PKR to phosphorylate eIF-2α, and this activation is likely mediated through the PKR RNA binding domain.

This ternary complex binds to the 40 S ribosomal subunit and to mRNA to form a 48 S species. Upon 60 S ribosomal subunit joining to the 48 S species, eIF-2-bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. For eIF-2 to promote another round of initiation, GTP must exchange for GDP, a reaction catalyzed by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor or eIF-2B(3Amesz H. Boumans H. Haubrich-Morre T. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4Konieczny A. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3402-3408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of serine residue 51 in eIF-2α increases the affinity of eIF-2 for GDP and thereby prevents GTP exchange and inhibits further initiation events(5Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, protein synthesis is immediately controlled through environmental changes. For example, protein synthesis is rapidly inhibited in response to heat shock(6Craig E. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 18: 239-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 7Duncan R. Hershey J.W.B.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 317-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, phosphorylation of eIF-2α correlates with inhibition of protein synthesis, although the specific kinases and/or phosphatases that regulate eIF-2α phosphorylation are poorly characterized(11Hershey J.W.B. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4: 201-207Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar).In mammalian cells, two related serine/threonine protein kinases that phosphorylate eIF-2α are the hemin-regulated inhibitor and the double-stranded RNA-activated inhibitor (PKR)(12Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7603-7606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hemin-regulated protein kinase is primarily expressed in erythroid cells and is activated by reduced levels of hemin. PKR is found in most cells, its synthesis is induced by interferon, and its activity is dependent upon dsRNA. PKR has a conserved serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic domain in its carboxyl terminus and two RNA binding motifs in its amino terminus(12Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7603-7606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N.S. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Hovanessian A.G.

Recent studies also suggest that PKR activates the nuclear transcription factor NFκB through phosphorylation of its inhibitor IκB(17Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6288-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). PKR-mediated phosphorylation of eIF-2α and subsequent inhibition of protein synthesis is implicated in the antiviral and antiproliferative effect of interferons(18Hovanessian A.G. Semin.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 159-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar, 25Sambrook J.F. Cell. 1990; 61: 197-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In response to hormonally generated inositol triphosphate, calcium is released to the cytoplasm as part of the signal transduction cascade(24Berridge M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 159-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar). Sequestered calcium can be released experimentally by treating cells with calcium ionophores (26Weissmann G. Anderson P.

At 60 h post-transfection, cells were treated with calcium ionophore A23187 for 15 min at 37°C and then labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine in methionine and cysteine-free minimal essential media (Life Technologies, Inc.) for an additional 15 min. Cell extracts were harvested in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer in the presence of the protease inhibitors soybean trypsin inhibitor (1.0 mg/ml), aprotinin (1.0 mg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1.0 mM). eIF-2α was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using monoclonal anti-eIF-2α antibody (kindly provided by the late Dr. Henshaw) and protein A-Sepharose as the immunoadsorbent. Steady state levels of eIF-2α were measured by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting procedures using anti-eIF-2α polyclonal antibody(37Davies M.V. Furtado M. Hershey J.W.B. Thimmappaya B. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9163-9167Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). T7 epitope-tagged proteins were detected by immunoprecipitation from cell extracts using anti-T7 antibody (Novagen, Madison, WI) and protein A-Sepharose as the immunoadsorbent.The phosphorylation status of eIF-2α expressed in COS-1 cells at 60 h post-transfection or in NIH3T3 cells was monitored by labeling cells with 2 ml of [32P]phosphate (400 μCi of orthophosphoric acid, DuPont NEN) for 4 h. Thapsigargin (300 nM, Sigma) or A23187 were added during the last 15 min of the labeling. Cycloheximide (10 μg/ml, Sigma) was added 15 min prior to the drug treatments and was maintained through the course of the labeling. Cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-eIF-2α antibody using protein A-Sepharose as the immunoadsorbent. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. All band intensities were quantified using NIH Image 1.55b program.RESULTSNIH3T3 cells were derived that overexpress either eIF-2α wt or a mutant eIF-2α S51A in which the site of PKR-mediated phosphorylation was mutated to alanine. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the steady state level of eIF-2α was significantly elevated in both wild-type (6.4-fold, Fig. 1A, lane 2) and mutant eIF-2α S51A (8.8-fold, Fig. 1A, lane 3) transfected cell lines compared to a cell line transfected with the original vector alone (Fig. 1A, lane 1). The overexpression of eIF-2α wild-type or S51A mutant did not significantly alter the cell growth rate or saturation density of the cells (data not shown). NIH3T3 cells were derived that overexpress a PKR mutant K296P in catalytic subdomain II. Western blot analysis using an anti-PKR polyclonal antibody detected expression of PKR K296P migrating at 72 kDa under conditions where the endogenous PKR was not detected in nontransfected cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5). Overexpression of PKR K296P increased the growth rate and increased saturation density similar to previous observations(22Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 23Meurs E.F. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar).The effect of wild-type eIF-2α, eIF-2α mutant S51A, or PKR mutant K296P overexpression on translation inhibition in response to calcium depletion was monitored by treating exponentially growing NIH3T3 cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 for 15 min and metabolic pulse labeling. Compared to untreated cells, A23187 treatment reduced protein synthesis to 13% in the original NIH3T3 cells and to 14% in cells that overexpress eIF-2α wt. In contrast, A23187 treatment reduced protein synthesis to 31% in cells that overexpress mutant eIF-2α S51A and to 29% in cells that overexpress PKR mutant K296P. Cells overexpressing either mutant eIF-2α S51A or PKR mutant K296P were more resistant to inhibition of protein synthesis over a range of A23187 concentrations compared to control cells that overexpress eIF-2α wt (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of wild-type eIF-2α, mutant eIF-2α S51A, or mutant PKR K296P did not detectably alter the specificity of polypeptides synthesized compared to control cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). In addition, A23187 treatment did not significantly alter the spectrum of polypeptide synthesized in these cell lines. These results suggest that expression of either mutant eIF-2α S51A or mutant PKR K296P protected the cells from inhibition of global protein synthesis upon A23187 treatment and did not protect translation of selective mRNAs.The synthesis of eIF-2α in the control and transfected cells was measured by immunoprecipitation of equal amounts of protein from the cell extracts with anti-eIF-2α antibody and analysis by SDS-PAGE. The synthesis of eIF-2α was increased in cells transfected with eIF-2α wt or eIF-2α S51A (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 5) compared to control NIH3T3 or cells that overexpress PKR K296P (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 7). eIF-2α synthesis was reduced approximately 5-fold upon A23187 treatment in control NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2) and in cells that overexpress eIF-2α wt (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, eIF-2α synthesis was not significantly reduced upon A23187 treatment in the cells that overexpress mutant eIF-2α S51A (Fig. 1D, lanes 5 and 6) or mutant PKR K296P (Fig. 1D, lanes 7 and 8). The effects of A23187 treatment on eIF-2α synthesis paralleled the effects on global protein synthesis in the different cell lines.The effect of calcium depletion on phosphorylation of eIF-2α was measured in NIH3T3 cells that overexpress eIF-2α wt. Immunoprecipitation of eIF-2α from [32P]phosphate-labeled NIH3T3 cells that overexpress eIF-2α wt detected [32P]phosphate incorporation into eIF-2α (Fig. 2, lane 1). Treatment with either A23187 or thapsigargin increased the [32P]phosphate incorporation by 3-fold (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 5). Whereas treatment with the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml, a concentration that inhibited protein synthesis greater than 90%) slightly reduced [32P]phosphate incorporation in NIH3T3 cells that overexpress eIF-2α wt, it did not significantly inhibit the increase in phosphorylation observed upon treatment with A23187 or thapsigargin (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 6). These results show that calcium depletion mediated by either A23187 or thapsigargin increases eIF-2α phosphorylation by a mechanism that does not require ongoing protein synthesis.Figure 2:Increased eIF-2α phosphorylation by calcium depletion does not require ongoing protein synthesis. NIH3T3 cells that overexpress wild-type eIF-2α were labeled with [32P]phosphate for 4 h and then treated with A23187 or thapsigargin in the presence (+) and absence (-) of cycloheximide (CHX) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-eIF-2α monoclonal antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further characterize the role of PKR in response to calcium depletion, we studied the effect of wild-type PKR overexpression on protein synthesis upon A23187 treatment. To date, we have not been able to obtain wild-type PKR overexpression in stably transfected NIH3T3 cells, possibly due to its negative effect on cell growth(38Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10893-10899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we were able to establish mouse fibroblast L929 cell lines that overexpress wild-type PKR. Western blot analysis of two independent cell lines transfected with wild-type PKR detected PKR protein under conditions where the endogenous PKR was not detected in nontransfected cells (Fig. 3A, data not shown). Treatment with 1 μM A23187 reduced protein synthesis to 40% in control L929 cells and to 17% in cells that overexpress wild-type PKR (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 7). Treatment with 5 μM A23187 completely inhibited protein synthesis in cells that overexpress wild-type PKR, whereas residual protein synthesis was detected in control L929 cells (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 8). Similar results were derived with an independently derived clone of L929 cells that overexpresses wild-type PKR (data not shown). These results demonstrate that overexpression of wild-type PKR sensitizes the cell to inhibition of protein synthesis mediated by calcium depletion.Figure 3:Overexpression of wild-type PKR sensitizes L929 cells to A23187. Panel A, cell lysates from the original L292 cells and from clone 2 were prepared and analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-PKR polyclonal antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel B, cells were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine in the presence (1, 5) or absence (-) of A23187 treatment (1 or 5 μM as indicated), and cell extracts were prepared for SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The role of RNA binding in the ability for PKR mutant K296P to inhibit eIF2α phosphorylation in response to A23187 was studied by transient overexpression of either the PKR RNA binding domain (amino acid residues 1-243) expressed independently or of another RNA binding protein, the HIV TRBP in COS-1 cells. The PKR mutant K296P and the amino-terminal 1-243 amino acids of PKR were engineered with a bacteriophage T7 epitope tag in the carboxyl terminus. The ability of these engineered molecules to inhibit activation of endogenous PKR was tested by a cotransfection assay to measure the rescue of translation of a reporter mRNA encoding adenosine deaminase that is not translated due to PKR activation(33Davies M.V. Elroy-Stein O. Jagus R. Moss B. Kaufman R.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1943-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each construct was cotransfected with the adenosine deaminase expression vector p9A, and total protein synthesis was measured by SDS-PAGE analysis of cell extracts. Upon cotransfection with the T7-tagged wild-type PKR expression vector, adenosine deaminase translation was not detected (Fig. 4A, lane 2), whereas cotransfection with either the T7-tagged RNA binding domain(1-243) or the T7-tagged PKR mutant K296P increased adenosine deaminase translation (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). In addition, a 35-kDa polypeptide and a 72-kDa polypeptide, the expected size for the T7-tagged proteins, were detected upon analysis of the total cell extracts (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4) and were specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 antibody (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 and 7). These results show that addition of the T7 tag to the carboxyl terminus of either PKR K296P or the RNA binding domain did not interfere with the ability of these proteins to inhibit endogenous PKR and rescue adenosine deaminase translation. Previous studies demonstrated inhibition of endogenous PKR activity by expression of TRBP in COS-1 cells(20Park H. Davies M.V. Langland J.O. Chang H-W. Nam Y.S. Tartaglia J. Paoletti E. Jacobs B.L.

Panel A, The T7-tagged constructs were cotransfected into COS-1 cells with the adenosine deaminase expression vector p9A (33Davies M.V. Elroy-Stein O. Jagus R. Moss B. Kaufman R.J. J.

At 60 h post-transfection, cells were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, and cell extracts were prepared for analysis by SDS-PAGE before (lanes 1-4) and after (lanes 5-7) immunoprecipitation with anti-T7 monoclonal antibody. Panels B and C, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with the wild-type eIF-2α cDNA in the expression plasmid pED-mtxrVA¯ and the indicated T7-tagged expression vectors and analyzed for eIF-2α phosphorylation as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effect of PKR mutant K296P, truncated 1-243 PKR, and TRBP on phosphorylation of eIF-2α in response to A23187 treatment was studied by cotransfection of these expression vectors with an eIF-2α expression vector. Since the subpopulation of transfected cells express both plasmid DNA molecules, the effect of protein expression from one plasmid on the phosphorylation status of eIF-2α overexpressed from a second plasmid (pED-2α wt) can be monitored. At 60 h post-transfection, the effect of A23187 treatment on the phosphorylation status of the overexpressed eIF-2α was determined by measuring the amount of [32P]phosphate incorporation into eIF-2α and comparing it to the steady state eIF-2α level measured by Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis showed that cells cotransfected with pED-2α wt had increased levels of eIF-2α (Fig. 4, B and C (bottom), lanes 10-16 and 19-22) compared to cells that did not receive DNA (Fig. 4, B and C (bottom), lanes 8, 9, 17, and 18). In the presence of wild-type PKR cotransfection, the level of eIF-2α was slightly reduced (Fig. 4B (bottom), lane 16), consistent with inhibition of protein synthesis mediated by wild-type PKR. In"

Sugiura Y. Takagi S. Winkelmann G. Van der Helm D. Neilands J.B. Iron Transport in Microbes, Plants and Animals, and Animals. VCH Verlagsges, Weinheim, FRG1987Google Scholar). Hitherto six such compounds have been isolated and identified from different gramineous plants. Although the chemical structures and numbers of biosynthesized MAs differ among plant species and even among cultivars within a species, all contain the same six functional groups which are coordinated to ferric iron. As these compounds play an important role in acquiring insoluble iron from soil for optimal growth of gramineous plants in addition to their unique structures, many efforts have been made to elucidate the biosynthetic pathways of MAs. In vivo and in vitro biosynthetic studies have consistently indicated that L-Met serves as a precursor for all MAs (10Mori S. Nishizawa N. Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 1081-1092Google Scholar; 3Kawai S. Itok K. Takagi S. Iwashita T. Nomoto K. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 1053-1056Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar; 13Shojima S.

Bull. 1992; 40: 2888-2892Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 1993, 1994a). A series of feeding studies demonstrated that all MAs share the same pathway from L-Met to 2’-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) although the subsequent steps differ and are dependent on the plant species and cultivar (4Ma J.F. Nomoto K. Chem. & Pharm. Bull. 1992; 40: 2888-2892Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 1993, 1994a).The biosynthesis of MAs is induced by iron deficiency stress in the roots (14Takagi S. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 1976; 22: 423-433Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar); the more severe the iron deficiency, the greater the amount of mugineic acids synthesized (15Takagi S. Nomoto K. Takemoto T. J. Plant Nutr. 1984; 7: 469-477Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of MAs proceeds throughout the day, and the biosynthesized MAs are then accumulated in the roots until their secretion to the rhizosphere the following morning. The amount of biosynthesized MAs reaches as high as 1-2% of root dry weight. However, the concentration of L-Met, the precursor, is extremely low in the roots. As such low levels of Met can maintain the observed high rate of MAs synthesis, we hypothesized that Met may be recycled during MAs biosynthesis in a manner similar to that occurring in ethylene production in ripening apples and tomatoes (16Yang S.F. Hoffman N.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 155-189Crossref Google Scholar). Several label experiments were conducted here to verify this hypothesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicalsD-[1-13C]Ribose, D-[2-13C]ribose, and D-[5-13C]ribose (99.0%13C) were purchased from ICON, Mt.

L-Amino acid oxidase (type VI) and catalase were from Sigma.D-5-[5-2H2]Methylthioribose (MTR) was prepared with D-ribose as the starting material. The latter (20 g) was converted to 1-o-[5-2H2]methyl-D-ribose acetonide (6.1 g) in four steps according to 1De Voss J.J. Hangeland J.J. Townsend C.A. J. Org. Chem. 1994; 59: 2715-2723Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar. Introduction of a methylthio group and hydrolysis were conducted as follows. To a solution of the acetonide prepared (6.1 g, 30 mmol) in pyridine (20 ml), p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (6 g, 31.5 mmol) was added at room temperature under N2. The mixture was stirred for 16 h and poured into ice (100 g), then acidified with 1 M HCl at 0°C and extracted twice with CH2Cl2. The combined extracts were washed with saturated NaHCO3 and saturated NaCl, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude tosylate (10 g, 93%) was used for the next conversion without any purification. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) ppm: 7.80 (2H, d, J = 8.4 Hz), 7.36 (2H, d, J = 8.4 Hz), 4.93 (1H, s), 4.60 (1H, d, J = 5.6 Hz), 4.53 (1H, d, J = 5.6 Hz), 4.30 (1H, s), 3.24 (3H, s), 2.46 (3H, s), 1.45 (3H, s), 1.23 (3H, s).To a solution of tosylate (10 g, 28 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (30 ml), sodium thiomethoxide (2.3 g, 33 mmol) was added at 0°C under N2. The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 30 min, then allowed to warm to room temperature. After further stirring for 2.5 h, the mixture was diluted with H2O (100 ml) and extracted twice with hexane. The combined organic extracts were dried over MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The corresponding D-[5-2H2]MTR acetonide was obtained as a pale yellow oil (6.1 g, 99%), and was used for the next conversion without any purification. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) ppm: 4.98 (1H, s), 4.72 (1H, d, J = 6 Hz), 4.61 (1H, d, J = 6 Hz), 4.27 (1H, s), 3.5 (3H, s), 2.15 (3H, s), 1.49 (3H, s), 1.33 (3H, s).A mixture of the acetonide (6 g, 27.2 mmol) and Amberite IR-120B (H+ form) (20 g) in H2O (80 ml) was stirred at 80°C for 8 h, then filtered through Celite to remove the ion exchange resin. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure.

J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 197: 309-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Catalase solution (containing 100 units) and L-amino acid oxidase (20 units) were added successively to a suspension of 0.5 g L-[1-13C]Met in 30 ml of water. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 by the addition of 1 M sodium hydroxide and the solution was incubated for 3 h in a water bath at 37°C. After the oxidation reaction was completed, the mixture was dialyzed with agitation against three changes of distilled water (1 liter each time) at 4°C for 12 h. The combined dialysates were evaporated in vacuo at 40°C to about 20 ml. The mixture was then passed through a cation exchange resin (Dowex 50, hydrogen form) to remove unconverted Met. The eluate was adjusted to pH 4.5 with 1 M NaOH, and the solution was concentrated in vacuo at 40°C. Finally, 120 mg of white powder was obtained by freeze-drying. The 1H and 13C NMR data were consistent with unlabeled KMB purchased from Ardrich except that C-1 of the synthesized product was 13C-enriched (~96%).Plant GrowthWheat plants (Triticum aestivum, L. cv Nourin 61) were cultured hydroponically as previously reported (5Ma J.F. Nomoto K. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, about 80 selected seedlings (7 days old) were transplanted to continuously aerated nutrient solution in 3-liter plastic pots in an environmental chamber. Hoagland solution (0.3 strength for macronutrients and full strength for micronutrients) was used for culture. The nutrient solution was adjusted to pH 5.5 with 0.1 M KOH and replaced every 2 days. Light intensity was adjusted to 40 W m-2, and the light/dark period and temperatures were set at 14/10 h and 17/10°C, respectively. After 11 days, the plants were subjected to iron deficiency.Feeding ExperimentsFeeding experiments were performed with 80 plants exposed to iron deficiency for 10-12 days as described above in 3-liter Wagner pots containing Hoagland solution. As the secretion of MAs is characterized by diurnal rhythm (15Takagi S. Nomoto K. Takemoto T. J. Plant Nutr. 1984; 7: 469-477Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar), all feeding experiments were conducted after secretion. The roots were fed with the following labeled compounds: 1) 300 μMD-[1-13C]ribose; 2) 300 μMD-[2-13C]ribose; 3) 300 μMD-[5-13C]ribose; 4) 250 μMD-[2-13C]ribose and 250 μMD-[5-13C]ribose; 5) 500 μM [5-2H2]MTR; and 6) 200 μM [1-13C]KMB.Isolation and PurificationRoot washings were collected the following day by soaking the roots in distilled water (3 liters, three times) from 3 to 5 h after the onset of the light period. The root washings were then charged on Amberlite IR-120 (H+), and the cationic fractions of 2 N NH4OH were eluted. Subsequent chromatography on Dowex 50W-X8 was performed, and gradient eluates with ammonia-formate buffer (pH 2.5-3.1) provided a concentrated active fraction. Chelating activities were determined by the o-phenanthroline method (14Takagi S. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 1976; 22: 423-433Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Concentrated DMA fractions were finally subjected to gel filtration through Sephadex G-10 with H2O as a solvent.NMR Study13C NMR measurements of isolated DMA (in D2O) were obtained with a 75.5-MHz spectrometer (GE-300). 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid sodium salt-d4 was used as an external reference for calibration of the chemical shift, and assignments for 13C were accomplished by 13C-1H COSY, 1H-detected multiple-bond heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence and 1H-detected heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence experiments. Calculation of 13C enrichment was based on the line intensity of the C-3 position. 1H NMR spectra of isolated DMA (in D2O) were recorded on a 400-MHz spectrometer (JNM-EX400), and assignments of 1H were accomplished by 1H-1H COSY. The 2H NMR spectra (in deuterium-depleted water) were measured at 61.3 MHz (JNM-EX400 spectrometer). The natural abundance of 2H in H2O was used as a chemical shift reference for the 2H NMR experiment. As 2H chemical shifts correspond to 1H shifts, the assignment was accomplished after analysis of the corresponding proton spectra.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION2’-Deoxymugineic acid is the first phytosiderophore to be biosynthesized and serves as a precursor for other MAs (Fig. 1) (6Ma J.F. Nomoto K. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 1994; 40: 311-317Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as significant differences in solubilization and uptake of iron were not observed among different MAs (5Ma J.F. Nomoto K. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), DMA is suggested as a key phytosiderophore. Since the aim of the present study was to determine how L-Met is derived during MAs biosynthesis, wheat, which secretes only DMA, was used as a model plant.2’-Deoxymugineic acid is biosynthesized from three molecules of L-Met (3Kawai S. Itok K. Takagi S. Iwashita T. Nomoto K. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 1053-1056Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar; 7Ma J.F. Nomoto K. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A series of label studies demonstrated that the 4-C moieties (C-1, −2, −3, and −4) of three Met contribute to the skeleton of DMA while the methylthio group does not (7Ma J.F. Nomoto K. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The amount of secreted DMA reached about 1.5 μmol plant-1 day-1 on the 12th day after commencement of iron deficiency, and usually more DMA was biosynthesized than was secreted since some DMA is retained within the roots. Despite this active biosynthesis of DMA in the wheat roots, the level of its first precursor, L-Met, was negligible.Generally, the level of Met is low in higher plants, being about 1/100 those of other amino acids such as Asp and Glu. The pathway leading to formation of L-Met in higher plants is Asp → Hse → o-phosphohomoserine → homocysteine → Met (2Giovanelli J. Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1974; 54: 725-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, there is no evidence to show that this pathway is stimulated during DMA biosynthesis. Also, the fate of the methylthio group derived from L-Met when it is converted to DMA is not known. Furthermore, Met biosynthesized by the above pathway is usually used for protein synthesis, and its activated form, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), is used for methylation and polyamine biosynthesis. If most biosynthesized Met is additionally consumed for DMA biosynthesis, the basal metabolic pathways will not function. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that Met is biosynthesized by some other pathway to maintain the active biosynthesis of DMA.Methionine also serves as a precursor of ethylene (16Yang S.F. Hoffman N.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 155-189Crossref Google Scholar), and it has been established that Met is recycled during ethylene production as shown in Fig. 1. The first step of the recycling pathway is the activation of Met by ATP to give AdoMet. S-Adenosylmethionine is fragmented to give 5’-methylthioadenosine and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, which is then converted to ethylene. 5’-Methylthioadenosine is hydrolyzed to MTR and adenine, and phosphorylation of MTR by MTR kinase yields 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate. Loss of the phosphate group of 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate, concurrent with the rearrangement of the ribose carbon atoms, leads to the synthesis of KMB. In the final step of the sequence, KMB is converted to Met via transamination. The overall result of this cycle is that the ribose moiety of ATP (carbons 2’, 3’, 4’, and 5’) furnishes the 4-carbon moiety of Met, and the CH3S group of Met is conserved for continued regeneration of Met.To examine whether this Met recycling pathway is operative during DMA biosynthesis in wheat roots, incorporation experiments using ribose labeled with 13C at different positions were carried out in wheat roots under iron deficient conditions. After feeding with 13C-labeled ribose, ATP labeled with 13C will be formed. If Met used for DMA biosynthesis is regenerated by the recycling pathway (Fig. 1), carbon 1 of the ribose moiety would not be incorporated into DMA because it is degraded into HCO2¯ during the cycle, while carbons 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the ribose moiety would incorporated into specific positions of DMA. When 300 μMD-[1-13C]ribose was fed to the wheat roots, 18.5 mg of purified DMA were obtained. The 13C NMR study showed that there was no 13C enrichment at any carbon of DMA (Fig. 2B). When roots were fed D-[2-13C]ribose under the same condition, the C-4’, −1, and −4’ positions of isolated DMA (18.2 mg) were 13C-enriched 1.86-, 1.71-, and 1.84-fold, respectively, by comparison of their peak heights with those of unlabeled DMA (Fig. 2, A and C). Feeding with D-[5-13C]ribose also resulted in 13C enrichment of DMA (44.4 mg) by 1.81-, 1.68-, and 2.07-fold at the C-1’, −4, and −1’ positions, respectively (Fig. 2D). A dual label experiment using equal concentration of D-[2-13C]ribose and D-[5-13C]ribose showed that 13C was equally incorporated into the specific positions of DMA (47.6 mg) (Fig. 2E). Although the pool of ribose is very large in the plants, the selective incorporation of 13C-labeled ribose to DMA suggests that Met is recycled during DMA biosynthesis as speculated (Fig. 1).Figure 2:13C NMR spectra of unlabeled 2’-deoxymugineic acid (A) and 2’-deoxymugineic acid derived from D-[1-13C]ribose (B), D-[2-13C]ribose (C), D-[5-13C]ribose (D), and the equal mixture of D-[2-13C]ribose and D-[5-13C]ribose (E) in wheat roots. Spectra were measured with a 75.5-MHz spectrometer (in D2O). Refer toFig. 1 for numbering. * represents the positions enriched by 13C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further confirm this speculation, two isotope-labeled intermediates of the Met cycling pathway, [5-2H2]MTR and [1-13C]KMB, were synthesized. 5-[5-2H2]Methylthioribose was synthesized according to the scheme shown in Fig. 3. If the Met cycling pathway is associated with DMA biosynthesis, the label (2H) of [5-2H2]MTR would be incorporated into C-4, −1’, and −1’ positions of DMA. In addition, in a previous study, when Met labeled with 2H at the C-4 position was fed to the wheat roots, 6 deuterium atoms from 3 molecules of 2H-labeled Met were completely incorporated into DMA (5Ma J.F. Nomoto K. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, 6 deuterium atoms would be similarly observed when fed with [5-2H2]MTR if the above speculation is correct. When [5-2H2]MTR was fed to the wheat roots, 2H signal of the isolated DMA (21.8 mg) was observed on the 2H NMR spectrum (Fig. 4). Relative peak intensities at 4.05, 3.95, 3.35, and 3.21 ppm were, respectively, approximated to 1:1:2:2, and a total of 6 deuterium atoms were observed. Based on the 1H NMR assignment, these peaks corresponded to the deuterium atoms at the C-4, C-1’, and C-1’ positions, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 4, both the numbers and positions of 2H incorporated are completely consistent with the above speculation, demonstrating that the Met recycling pathway is operative during DMA biosynthesis.Figure 3:Reaction scheme for the synthesis of 5-[5-2H2]methylthioribose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4:1H NMR spectrum of unlabeled 2’-deoxymugineic acid (A) and 2H NMR spectrum of 2’-deoxymugineic acid (B) derived from 5-[5-2H2]methylthioribose in wheat roots.

If the Met recycling pathway is related to DMA biosynthesis, [1-13C]KMB would be converted into [1-13C]Met by transamination, resulting in 13C enrichment of three carboxyl groups in DMA. When roots were fed [1-13C]KMB, 22.8 mg of DMA were isolated. The results of 13C NMR analysis showed that the C-4’, −1, and −4’ positions were 13C-enriched by 3.66-, 3.64-, and 3.94-fold, respectively (Fig. 5). This result further confirmed the relationship between the Met recycling pathway and DMA biosynthesis.Figure 5:13C NMR spectra of unlabeled 2’-deoxymugineic acid (A) and 2’-deoxymugineic acid (B) derived from 2-[1-13C]keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid in wheat roots.

Our results also suggest that the Met recycling pathway is not limited to ripening apples and tomatoes but is also active in wheat roots. This pathway allows continuous generation of ATP resulting in the continuous synthesis of DMA in wheat roots even where the Met pool is small, enabling DMA to be synthesized without depleting the cellular Met pools.L-Methionine was also found to be activated into AdoMet first by ATP before leading to DMA in vitro (13Shojima S. Nishizawa N.K. Fushiya S. Nozoe S. Irifune T. Mori S. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1497-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the case of ethylene biosynthesis, AdoMet is fragmented to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and 5’-methylthioadenosine, and the latter enters the Met recycling pathway. 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid is not incorporated into DMA, and azetidine-2-carboxylic acid has been suggested to be an intermediate (7Ma J.F. Nomoto K. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This suggests that AdoMet splits into azetidine-2-carboxylic acid and 5’-methylthioadenosine during DMA biosynthesis (Fig. 1).The process of iron acquisition by some gramineous plants includes MAs biosynthesis inside the roots, diurnal rhythmic secretion of MAs to the rhizosphere, effective solubilization of insoluble iron in soils by chelation, and specific uptake of MAs-iron complexes. To date, only some gramineous plants have been found to have the ability to biosynthesize MAs. The strategy of iron acquisition by secreting MAs adopted by gramineous plants has advantages over others (such as those in dicotyledonous and nongramineous monocotyledonous plants) for adaptation to calcareous soils from an ecological point of view (12Römheld V. Marschner H. Physiol. Plant. 1987; 70: 231-234Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Therefore, this strategy has been targeted for breeding crops resistant to iron deficiency, and some attempts have been made to isolate genes encoding MAs biosynthesis. The present results represent important information for plant breeders that genes responsible for both MAs biosynthesis and Met cycling should be considered. Mugineic acids (MAs),1 1The abbreviations used are: MAmugineic acidDMA2’-deoxymugineic acidMTR5-methylthioriboseKMB2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acidAdoMetS-adenosylmethionine. 1The abbreviations used are: MAmugineic acidDMA2’-deoxymugineic acidMTR5-methylthioriboseKMB2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acidAdoMetS-adenosylmethionine. a group of ferric iron chelating substances which have been isolated from root exudates of some gramineous plants such as barley and wheat, have been recognized as phytosiderophores (see e.g. 11Nomoto K. Sugiura Y. Takagi S. Winkelmann G. Van der Helm D. Neilands J.B. Iron Transport in Microbes, Plants and Animals, and Animals. VCH Verlagsges, Weinheim, FRG1987Google Scholar). Hitherto six such compounds have been isolated and identified from different gramineous plants. Although the chemical structures and numbers of biosynthesized MAs differ among plant species and even among cultivars within a species, all contain the same six functional groups which are coordinated to ferric iron. As these compounds play an important role in acquiring insoluble iron from soil for optimal growth of gramineous plants in addition to their unique structures, many efforts have been made to elucidate the biosynthetic pathways of MAs. In vivo and in vitro biosynthetic studies have consistently indicated that L-Met serves as a precursor for all MAs (10Mori S. Nishizawa N. Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 1081-1092Google Scholar; 3Kawai S. Itok K. Takagi S. Iwashita T. Nomoto K. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 1053-1056Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar; 13Shojima S.

Bull. 1992; 40: 2888-2892Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 1993, 1994a). A series of feeding studies demonstrated that all MAs share the same pathway from L-Met to 2’-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) although the subsequent steps differ and are dependent on the plant species and cultivar (4Ma J.F. Nomoto K. Chem. & Pharm. Bull. 1992; 40: 2888-2892Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 1993, 1994a). mugineic acid 2’-deoxymugineic acid 5-methylthioribose 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid S-adenosylmethionine. mugineic acid 2’-deoxymugineic acid 5-methylthioribose 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid S-adenosylmethionine. The biosynthesis of MAs is induced by iron deficiency stress in the roots (14Takagi S. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 1976; 22: 423-433Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar); the more severe the iron deficiency, the greater the amount of mugineic acids synthesized (15Takagi S. Nomoto K. Takemoto T. J. Plant Nutr. 1984; 7: 469-477Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of MAs proceeds throughout the day, and the biosynthesized MAs are then accumulated in the roots until their secretion to the rhizosphere the following morning. The amount of biosynthesized MAs reaches as high as 1-2% of root dry weight. However, the concentration of L-Met, the precursor, is extremely low in the roots. As such low levels of Met can maintain the observed high rate of MAs synthesis, we hypothesized that Met may be recycled during MAs biosynthesis in a manner similar to that occurring in ethylene production in ripening apples and tomatoes (16Yang S.F. Hoffman N.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 155-189Crossref Google Scholar). Several label experiments were conducted here to verify this hypothesis.

IRP1 isolated from iron-repleted cells contains an 4Fe-4S cluster and is an active aconitase, but binds IREs with low affinity (24Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Kennedy M.C. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11735-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In contrast, IRP1 isolated from iron-depleted cells lacks an 4Fe-4S cluster and aconitase activity, but binds IREs with high affinity. Thus, IRP1 functions as either an RNA-binding protein or cytosolic aconitase, depending on levels of intracellular iron. The function of aconitase activity in IRP1 is unclear; however, recent data indicated that aconitase activity is not required for the iron-dependent regulation of IRE binding(25Philpott C.C. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7321-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). IRP2 was identified by RNA-band shift analysis in extracts from rat tissue and cultured cells (4Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and in regenerating rat liver(26Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6405-6409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IRP2 has been purified from rat liver and has a molecular mass estimated as 104,000 Da(27Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The partial amino acid sequences of a peptide derived from rat liver IRP2 was similar to the deduced sequence of an IRP2-like cDNA isolated from a human T cell library(16Rouault T.A. Tang C.K. Kaptain S. Burgess W.H. Haile D.J. Samaniego F. McBride O.W. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7958-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Rouault T.A.

Mouse tissues and cells have been shown by RNA-band shift analysis to contain a second IRP termed IRFB(28Henderson B.R. Seiser C. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 27327-27334Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). UV-cross-linking experiments indicated that mouse IRFB has a molecular mass of 105,000 Da which is similar to the mass of rat IRP2, suggesting that these proteins are homologous. Although RNA binding activities of IRP1 and IRP2 decrease in iron-treated cells, the mechanisms that regulate their RNA binding activities differ. The decrease in IRP1 RNA binding activity is due to the switch to an 4Fe-4S form and occurs without changes in IRP1 levels (18Yu Y. Radisky E. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19005-19010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tang C.K. Chin J. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24466-24470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, IRP2 RNA binding activity decreases via reduction in IRP2 levels(27Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30904-30910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike IRP1, IRP2 lacks aconitase activity(27Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of two IRPs in cells that are regulated by iron by different mechanisms raises questions of the function and necessity of two IRPs. To begin to answer these questions, we report the isolation and sequence of cDNAs for rat liver and human fetal brain IRP2. We also provide an analysis of the expression of IRP2 in rat tissues and demonstrate that IRP2 is also present in lower eukaryotes, indicating that IRP2 is highly conserved. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of multiple IRP2 mRNA transcripts in rat, mouse, and human cells that may be regulated by alternative polyadenylation in iron-depleted cells. Rat hepatoma cells (FTO2B), mouse fibroblasts (NIH 3T3), and human primary transformed embryonal kidney cells (293) and HeLa cells were grown at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. cDNA clones corresponding to the rat and human IRP2s were isolated from rat liver and human fetal brain libraries, respectively. For the isolation of the rat IRP2 cDNA, two rat liver libraries were screened. A Stratagene rat liver library was sequentially screened with two random-primed (31Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar) 32P-labeled DNA fragments generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR that corresponded to the 225-bp 73-amino-acid insertion (probe 1) and to the last 500 bp of the coding region (probe 3) of the human T cell 10.1 cDNA (16Rouault T.A. Tang C.K. Kaptain S. Burgess W.H. Haile D.J. Samaniego F. McBride O.W. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7958-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (see Reverse Transcriptase-PCR below). Approximately 2 × 106 recombinants were screened, and 3 recombinants were isolated and sequenced using Sequenase (United States Biochemical Corp.). Sequence analysis of the longest clone, pSL800, showed that it contained a putative initiation codon followed by an 876-bp open reading frame and 6 bp of the 5’-UTR sequence. No recombinants were isolated that correspond to the COOH-end or the 3’-UTR of IRP2. To obtain IRP2 cDNAs containing the 3’ sequence, a rat liver cDNA library provided by Dr. Jonathan Gitlin (Washington University School of Medicine) was screened with probe 3. Approximately 2 × 106 plaques were screened, and 4 recombinants of varying lengths were isolated and partially sequenced. The longest cDNA, pUZB2-1, contained 1017 bp of coding region and 2850 bp of 3’-UTR. Since cDNAs corresponding to nucleotides 877 to 1875 were not found in either of the two libraries, reverse transcriptase-PCR using oligonucleotide primers from the 3’ end of pSL800 and the 5’ end of pUZB2-1 was used to amplify the corresponding region from rat liver mRNA (see Reverse Transcriptase-PCR). The reverse transcriptase-PCR product was cloned into PCR-Script SK(+) (Stratagene) and sequenced. A human IRP2 cDNA was isolated from a human fetal brain library (Stratagene) using probes 1 and 3. Approximately 6.0 × 105 recombinants were screened, and 8 recombinants were isolated. Two cDNAs were mapped, and their coding regions were sequenced. pSLFB4a was 3.0 kb in length. It included nucleotides 175 to 2889 based on the rat sequence and 386 bp of the 3’-UTR sequence. pSLFB15c was 3.0 kb in length and included 2859 bp of coding sequence. To isolate cDNA clones for the rat and human IRP2, IRP2 probes were generated by amplifying IRP2 sequences from rat liver mRNA with primers from the human 10.1 sequence (16Rouault T.A. Tang C.K. Kaptain S. Burgess W.H. Haile D.J. Samaniego F. McBride O.W. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7958-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These PCR probes were then used to screen the rat liver and human fetal brain cDNA libraries. We have previously shown that the amino acid sequence of a peptide derived from rat IRP2 is similar to sequences in the human 10.1 cDNA, suggesting that these are homologous proteins(27Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primers corresponding to sequences in the human 10.1 sequence (16Rouault T.A. Tang C.K. Kaptain S. Burgess W.H. Haile D.J. Samaniego F. McBride O.W. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7958-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) were generated and used for reverse transcriptase-PCR. The sequences of these primers and their corresponding locations in the rat IRP2 sequence are: probe 1, nucleotides 418 to 435, ATACAGAATGCACCAAAT, and nucleotides 631-648, GTGCCTGAACCTGAAACA, and probe 3, nucleotides 2389-2408, GGCACTTTTGC-AAATATCAA, and nucleotides 2872-2892, GTGGCACGAAAATTCTCATAG. RNA was prepared from FT02B rat hepatoma cells using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended. First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with 1 μg of total RNA in a reaction volume of 20 μl with either oligo(dT)22−16 or random hexamers by using SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. The PCR reaction contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM dNTP, 50 pmol of each primer, 1/100 of cDNA synthesized, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. 30 cycles were carried out at an annealing temperature of 56°C. The PCR products were separated in a 2% agarose gel, and the appropriate size gel fragments were excised and eluted from the gel and used as probes. Reverse transcriptase-PCR product corresponding to 877-1875 was synthesized using primers corresponding to nucleotides 855-869, TATAACCATGGTGAATGGATT, and 1953-1973, TACTGACTCTACAGGCAAGAA. The PCR product was cloned into pCR-Script SK(+) plasmid (Stratagene) and sequenced. Tissues from Sprague-Dawley male rats were isolated and were pulverized in liquid nitrogen. After the powder was added to SDS buffer (1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and boiled for 10 min, 0.25% bromphenol blue and 2%β-mercaptoethanol were added. The concentration of protein in the extracts was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Protein extracts were prepared from the following tissues and organisms: skeletal muscle of zebra fish (a gift from Dr. D. Grunwald), skeletal muscle of Xenopus laevis (a gift from Dr. B. Bass), and whole Drosophila melanogaster third instar larvae (a gift from Dr. A. Letsou) all at the University of Utah. All tissues and larvae were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and processed as described for the rat tissues. Equal amounts of protein were electrophoretically separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. IRP1 and IRP2 were detected by incubation of the membranes with chicken polyclonal antibodies directed against the coding region of rat IRP1 or rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against the 73-amino-acid insertion of rat IRP2 (27Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the primary antibody incubations, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-chicken or goat anti-rabbit antibodies, using the Enhanced Chemiluminescent (ECL) Western blotting detection system (Amersham). Four separate immunoblotting experiments were performed and one representative blot is shown. RNA-band shift assays and electrophoresis of the RNA·protein complexes were performed as described previously(4Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In some experiments, rabbit anti-IRP2 antisera or rabbit preimmune serum was preincubated for 10 min with extracts prior to the addition of 32P-labeled IRE. RNA-band shift assays were performed four times and one representative experiment is shown. Total RNA was isolated from the tissues of male Sprague-Dawley rats using guanidium thiocyanate (32Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16608) Google Scholar) or from 293 cells, HeLa cells, mouse 3T3 cells, and rat FTO2B cells using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA (10 μg) was electrophoresed on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels in MOPS buffer (pH 7.0). The RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with random-primed 32P-labeled rat IRP2 DNA probes corresponding to the 73-amino-acid insertion (225 bp), to the entire coding region (2889 bp), and to two 3’-UTR fragments (214 bp) and (2200 bp) located downstream from the alternative polyadenylation consensus signals. Hybridization was carried out using Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham) for 1 h at 65°C according to the manufacturer, and the membranes were washed at 2 × SSC (20 × SSC = 3 M NaCl2, 0.3 M sodium acetate) at 25°C for 15 min followed by a wash at 1 × SSC at 65°C for 10 min. Northern blotting experiments were performed at least 3-5 times and one representative blot from each experiment is shown. To study the expression and regulation of IRP2, we cloned and sequenced IRP2 cDNAs from rat liver and human fetal brain libraries (see “Materials and Methods”). The rat IRP2 cDNA was 5.7 kb in length and contained an open reading frame of 2889 bp and 5’- and 3’-UTRs of 6 bp and 2.9 kb, respectively. The human IRP2 contained an open reading frame of 2714 bp and a 3’-UTR of 386 bp. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of the rat IRP2 cDNA with those of a human T cell IRP2 cDNA or the human fetal brain cDNA showed that they share 93% identity and 97% similarity. Human and rat IRP2 sequences are contiguous along their lengths except for a deletion and an insertion of glycine residues at position 32 and between positions 426-427 in the human fetal brain IRP2 cDNA (data not shown). Since the amino-terminal sequences of the human and rat IRP2s have not been determined, their translation initiation codons have been tentatively assigned. We believe that the ATG assignment in the rat and human cDNAs may represent full-length or close to full-length coding regions since rat IRP2 expressed in yeast migrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with mobility similar to that of the endogenous rat liver IRP2 (data not shown). Rat liver IRP1 and IRP2 are conserved proteins sharing 61% amino acid identity and 79% amino acid similarity. A notable difference between IRP1 and IRP2 is the insertion into IRP2 of a 73-amino-acid domain located 139 amino acids downstream from the putative translational initiation codon (Fig. 1). This sequence is rich in cysteines, serines, and prolines and also contains a site located between amino acids Ser193 and Gln194 that is susceptible to proteolysis during purification(27Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage at this site results in the appearance of an 83,000-Da fragment. Finally, a serine located at residue 130 in IRP1, which has been shown to cross-link to IRE RNA(33Basilion J.P. Rouault T.A. Massinople C.M. Klausner R.D. Burgess W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), is also conserved in IRP2, suggesting that RNA binding sites may be conserved between these proteins. Like IRP1, IRP2 shares about 26% amino acid identity and 51% amino acid similarity with mitochondrial aconitase (Fig. 1). IRP1 contains a 4Fe-4S cluster similar to the cluster in mitochondrial aconitase (34Kennedy M.C. Mende-Mueller L. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11730-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and is an active aconitase(24Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Kennedy M.C. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11735-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). All 18 active-site residues in mitochondrial aconitase, including the 3 cysteines that are ligands for the 4Fe-4S cluster, are conserved in IRP1(21Rouault T.A. Stout C.D. Kaptain S. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 64: 881-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Inspection of IRP2 sequences from rat liver and human fetal brain shows that, although they contain these 3 cysteines and 16 of the 18 active-site residues, 2 residues essential for enzymatic activity, Arg474 and Ser369 in mitochondrial aconitase, are substituted with Lys611 and Asn853 in rat IRP2. Thus, not surprisingly, IRP2 does not exhibit aconitase activity(27Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether IRP2 contains a 4Fe-4S cluster similar to those of mitochondrial aconitase and IRP1 is not known. Rat hepatoma FTO2B cells contained three mRNAs that hybridized with the IRP2 cDNA: two major mRNAs of 6.4 kb and 3.7 kb and one minor mRNA of 4.0 kb (Fig. 2B, lanes a and b). The sizes of the three mRNAs are sufficient to encode an IRP2 whose relative molecular mass is 104,000 Da(27Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rat liver IRP2 cDNA is estimated to be at least 5.7 kb, and, therefore, we believe that it corresponds to the 6.4-kb mRNA. These mRNAs encode IRP2, and not IRP1, since a probe corresponding to the 73 amino acid insertion in IRP2 hybridized to all three mRNAs (Fig. 2B, lane b). Also, probes representing various regions of the IRP2 coding region hybridized to all three mRNAs, indicating that the 4.0-kb and 3.7-kb mRNAs did not contain major coding region deletions (data not shown). Finally, Southern blotting analysis suggested that IRP2 is encoded by a single gene (data not shown). These data suggested that the differences in length of the IRP2 mRNAs might be due to the lack of either 5’- or 3’-UTR sequences. We isolated an IRP2 cDNA that contained 2.9 kb of 3’-UTR sequence and sequenced the first 800 bp after the termination codon. Inspection of this sequence revealed the presence of two alternative poly(A) signal sequences (Fig. 3). One sequence, AATAAA, is located at nucleotide 3169 and is a perfect match with the consensus sequence (35Proudfoot N.J. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1976; 263: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar). This sequence is also present in the human T cell IRP2 cDNA (Fig. 3). Two GU- or U-rich elements that are commonly found downstream of the AAUAAA element (36Wickens M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 277-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) are present at nucleotides 3227 and 3261 in the rat sequence and at nucleotides 3215 and 3251 in the human sequence (Fig. 3). A minor poly(A) signal sequence, GATAAA, is located at nucleotide 3512 in the rat sequence. Thus, the possibility existed that the 4.0-kb and 3.7-kb mRNAs might have been generated by polyadenylation at these upstream sites. If the 4.0-kb and 3.7-kb mRNAs are generated by alternative polyadenylation site utilization, these mRNAs should not contain 3’-UTR sequences downstream from the poly(A) signal sequences. Two 3’-UTR probes were prepared that corresponded to a KpnI fragment of 214 bp and a KpnI/EcoRI fragment of 2200 bp (Fig. 2A). The conserved poly(A) consensus sequence is located 5’ to the 214-bp KpnI and the 2200-bp KpnI/EcoRI fragments, and the minor poly(A) consensus sequence is located 5’ to the 2200-bp fragment (Fig. 2A). The 214-bp probes hybridized to the 6.4-kb and 4.0-kb mRNA, but not to the 3.7-kb mRNA (Fig. 2B, lanes c). The 214-bp probe also hybridized to an unknown mRNA of about 2.5 kb. This mRNA did not hybridize to IRP2 coding region probes a and b, indicating that it does not encode IRP2. The 2200-bp probe did not hybridize to either the 4.0-kb or the 3.7-kb mRNAs (Fig. 2B, lane d). These data indicated that the 3.7-kb and the 4.0-kb mRNAs lacked 3’-UTR sequences downstream from the AAUAAA sequence and the GATAAA sequences, respectively, suggesting that these sites might be utilized for polyadenylation. To determine if the three mRNAs are present in rat tissues, total RNA isolated from brain, intestinal mucosa, heart, kidney, liver, and lung from rats was hybridized to a 32P-labeled IRP2 coding region probe (Fig. 2C). The three mRNAs are present in all tissues examined; however, the amounts of the 3.7-kb and 4.0-kb mRNAs varied among the different tissues. Intestinal mucosa, kidney, liver, and lung contain higher amounts of the 3.7-kb mRNA, whereas brain and heart contain lower amounts of this transcript. Since the AAUAAA element is present in the human IRP2 3’-UTR sequence, this suggests that human cells, and perhaps other rodents, may contain multiple IRP2 mRNAs. Hybridization of a 32P-labeled IRP2 cDNA to total RNA from human 293 and HeLa cells and mouse 3T3 cells demonstrated that the three mRNAs were present in these cells (Fig. 4A). The presence of multiple IRP2 mRNAs in rat, mouse, and human cells and the conservation of rat and human 3’-UTR sequences, particularly the poly(A) signal sequence, suggests that the 3’-UTR may be important in regulation of these mRNAs. To determine if changes in intracellular iron levels affect amounts of these mRNAs, mouse 3T3 cells and rat FTO2B cells were treated in the presence or absence of ferric ammonium citrate, or desferrioxamine, an intracellular iron chelator, for 16 h (Fig. 4B). Total RNA was prepared from these cells and hybridized to a 32P-labeled IRP2 cDNA. The 3.7-kb mRNA increased 2-fold and 5-fold in desferrioxamine-treated FTO2B and 3T3 cells, respectively, compared to untreated cells (Fig. 4B). Densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms showed that the amount of the 3.7-kb mRNA increased with a reciprocal and an equal decrease in the amount of the 6.4-kb mRNA, suggesting that total IRP2 mRNA levels remain constant. In iron-treated FTO2B and 3T3 cells, the amount of the 6.4-kb mRNA did not change, whereas the amount of the 3.7-kb mRNA decreased slightly in FTO2B cells and was barely detectable in 3T3 cells. The 4.0-kb mRNA was unaffected by iron or desferrioxamine treatment, in both FTO2B and 3T3 cells; however, the levels of this mRNA were too low to accurately quantitate. Based on these data, we propose that the 3.7-kb mRNA is produced by alternative poly(A) site utilization in iron-depleted cells. The question arises of the biological relevance of two IRPs in cells. One possibility is that the distributions of IRP1 and IRP2 may differ among tissues. To address this question, the levels of IRP1 and IRP2 in rat tissues were compared by Western blotting. Extracts from rat tissues were analyzed by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-IRP1 antisera or anti-IRP2 antisera. Fig. 5 shows that IRP1 and IRP2 are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, but at different levels. Whereas IRP1 levels are highest in kidney and liver, IRP2 levels are highest in heart and muscle (Fig. 5). Other immunoreactive bands were observed on the IRP2 immunoblot. Previous data indicated that IRP2 is susceptible to proteolysis during purification, resulting in the appearance of an 83,000-Da protein and smaller degradation products. In contrast to IRP2, IRP1 is relatively stable. To minimize IRP2 degradation, tissues were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and immediately thereafter were boiled in SDS-sample buffer, followed by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Even with this rapid purification protocol, degradation of IRP2 is observed in some of the tissue extracts examined. RNA binding activity of IRP1 has been demonstrated not only in mammals, but in fish, flies, and frogs(37Rothenberger S. Mullner E.W. Kuhn L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1175-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To determine if IRP2 is present in other species, protein extracts were prepared from the yeast S. cerevisiae, zebra fish muscle, Drosophila larvae, Xenopus muscle, rat FTO2B cells, mouse 3T3 cells, and human 293 cells, and the proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-IRP2 antisera generated against the 73-amino-acid insertion. Fig. 6 shows that IRP2 is present in all organisms examined, although the size of the protein varies. The apparent molecular mass of IRP2 from Drosophila is larger than that of rat, whereas IRP2 from human cells has a smaller apparent molecular mass. While yeast extracts contain a protein of about 75 kDa that reacts with the IRP2 antibody, we believe this band to be nonspecific since it also reacts with anti-IRP1 antisera (data not shown). Because the levels of IRP2 vary significantly in different tissues, it is difficult to assign significance to the levels of IRP2 in different organisms. A distinct IRP2·IRE complex has not been observed in extracts from human cells and tissues. To determine if the lack of a distinct human IRP2·IRE complex is due to the comigration of IRP1·IRE and IRP2·IRE complexes on gels, cytosolic extracts were prepared from human 293 and HeLa cells, and, as controls, mouse 3T3 and rat FTO2B cells and the extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled IRE in the presence or absence of anti-IRP2 antisera. The RNA·protein complexes were analyzed by native polyacrylamide gels. Mouse and rat extracts contain distinctive IRP1·IRE and IRP2·IRE complexes (Fig. 7, lanes 1 and 2 and 5 and 6). In contrast, human cells contain only one complex (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 4 and 7 and 8). Addition of anti-IRP2 antisera to extracts resulted in slower migrating “supershifted” complexes corresponding to the IRP2·IRE complexes in mouse, rat, and human cells (Fig. 7, lanes 9-12). Rabbit preimmune antisera used at the same amounts as anti-IRP2 antisera has no effect on IRP·IRE complexes (Fig. 7, lanes 5-8). These data indicate that human IRP1·IRE and IRP2·IRP2 complexes comigrate on native polyacrylamide gels. The studies reported here describe the characterization of cDNAs for rat and human IRP2 and the presence of multiple IRP2 mRNAs regulated in iron-depleted mammalian cells. Our data indicate that, although rat IRP1 and IRP2 are 61% identical in the overall amino acid sequence, IRP2 lacks two aconitase active-site residues and contains a 73-amino-acid insertion near its amino terminus that is rich in proline, serine, and cysteine. Thus, it is not surprising that IRP2 lacks aconitase activity(27Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether IRP2 contains an 4Fe-4S cluster similar to the 4Fe-4S cluster in IRP1 and mitochondrial aconitase is unknown. Modeling of the 73-amino-acid insertion onto the structure of mitochondrial aconitase suggests that it is located at the beginning of a helical region and could be located on the surface of the protein. The location of the 73-amino-acid insertion on the surface of the protein is consistent with our data indicating that the 73-amino-acid insertion contains a site that is susceptible to proteolysis during purification(27Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 73-amino-acid insertion does not appear to be directly involved in RNA binding since antibodies directed against this region do not prevent IRE binding. RNA binding activity of IRP2 is regulated by iron by a decrease in levels of IRP2 which occurs via an increase in the rate of IRP2 degradation(27Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30904-30910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the 73-amino-acid insertion is unique to IRP2, it is tempting to speculate that the structural determinants responsible for iron-mediated IRP2 degradation may reside in this region. IRP2 is encoded by two major mRNAs of 6.4 kb and 3.7 kb and a minor mRNA of 4.0 kb. The 4.0-kb mRNA is present at lower levels than that of the 3.7-kb mRNA, suggesting that polyadenylation at the weaker GATAAA poly(A) consensus sequence is not efficient. The significance of the 3.7-kb mRNA that is regulated in iron-depleted cells is not clear. We believe, however, that the 3.7-kb mRNA serves a functional role in IRP2 expression for the following reasons. First, the upstream poly(A) site implicated in mRNA processing is present not only in the 3’-UTR of rat mRNA, but also in the human mRNA. Second, the 3.7-kb mRNA is found in rodent and human cells, suggesting that the upstream poly(A) site is used for RNA processing in these cells. Third, the increase in levels of the 3.7-kb mRNA in iron-depleted cells occurs with a reciprocal decrease in the levels of the 6.4-kb mRNA. Since total IRP2 mRNA levels remain constant in iron-depleted cells, this suggests that the production of the 3.7-kb mRNA may be due to alternative utilization of the upstream poly(A) site. We cannot, however, eliminate the possibility that the 3.7-kb mRNA is stabilized and the 6.4-kb mRNA is destabilized in iron-depleted cells. Since our data suggest that the coding potential of IRP2 is not altered in the 3.7-kb and 4.0-kb mRNAs, the question arises of the functional significance of these mRNAs. One possibility is that the 3.7-kb mRNA is translated with higher efficiency than that of the 6.4- kb mRNA. Our previous data indicated that IRP2 levels are increased in iron-depleted cells and destabilized in iron-repleted cells(27Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the increased IRP2 levels in iron-depleted cells are due to increased processing and translation of the 3.7-kb mRNA, in addition to increased IRP2 stability. The regulation of alternative poly(A) site selection is used by viruses (38McLauchlan J. Simpson S. Clements J.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 1093-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39Mann K.P. Weiss E.A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7891-7898Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to regulate gene expression. Recent studies have shown that levels of specific poly(A) site processing factors can stimulate or depress utilization of a specific poly(A) site(38McLauchlan J. Simpson S. Clements J.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 1093-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39Mann K.P. Weiss E.A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell.

IRP2, like that of IRP1, is present not only in mammals, but also in fish, flies, and frogs, suggesting that the regulation of iron homeostasis may be similar in these lower eukaryotes. Our data indicate that human IRP1·IRE and IRP2·IRE complexes comigrate on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, in contrast to rodent IRP1·IRE and IRP2·IRE complexes which migrate as distinct complexes. The reason for the altered mobilities of human and rodent IRP1 and IRP2 complexes is unknown, but may be due to subtle charge differences in mammalian IRPs. What may be the biological relevance of two IRPs in cells, each being regulated by iron but by different mechanisms? Although we do not know the specific function of IRP2 in cells, three possibilities can be postulated. First, IRP2 has been shown to recognize a specific subset of in vitro-synthesized IRE RNAs, suggesting a role of IRP2 in the regulation of specific IRE-containing mRNAs(28Henderson B.R. Seiser C. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 27327-27334Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Second, IRP2, although ubiquitously expressed, is present at higher levels in skeletal muscle and heart than IRP1, suggesting a role of IRP2 in the regulation of muscle-specific IRE-containing mRNAs. Third, IRP2 RNA binding activity is increased in regenerating rat liver (26Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6405-6409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is decreased in livers from rats subjected to oxidative stress(41Cairo G. Tacchini L. Pogliaghi G. Anzon E. Tomasi A. Bernelli-Zazzera A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 700-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Thus, it is also possible that IRP2 is regulated by biological mediators other than iron.

https://openalex.org/W2045047817,"Relatively little is known about the neural circuitry underlying sex-specific behaviors. We have expressed the feminizing gene transformer in genetically defined subregions of the brain of male Drosophila, and in particular within different domains of the mushroom bodies. Mushroom bodies are phylogenetically conserved insect brain centers implicated in associative learning and various other aspects of behavior. Expression of transformer in lines that mark certain subsets of mushroom body intrinsic neurons, and in a line that marks a component of the antennal lobe, causes males to exhibit nondiscriminatory sexual behavior: they court mature males in addition to females. Expression of transformer in other mushroom body domains, and in control lines, has no such effect. Our data support the view that genetically defined subsets of mushroom body intrinsic neurons perform different functional roles."

The role of this sequence (NPLFY) in angiotensin II receptor function was studied in mutant and wild-type rat type 1a angiotensin II receptors transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. The ability of the receptor to interact with G proteins and to stimulate inositol phosphate responses was markedly impaired by alanine replacement of Asn298 and was reduced by replacement of Pro299 or Tyr302.

However, its affinity for angiotensin II and the nonpeptide antagonist losartan was reduced by an order of a magnitude, suggesting that angiotensin II and losartan share an intramembrane binding site, possibly through their aromatic moieties. None of the agonist-occupied mutant receptors, including Y302A and triple alanine replacements of Phe301, Tyr302, and Phe304, showed substantial changes in their internalization kinetics. These findings demonstrate that the NPLFY sequence of the type 1a angiotensin II receptor is not an important determinant of agonist-induced internalization.

Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). Although these receptors all possess the basic seven-transmembrane structure, the number of highly conserved amino acids shared by the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors is relatively few(6Probst W.C.

One such conserved motif is the characteristic NPX2-3Y sequence that is located in the seventh transmembrane domain of most receptors, and in the rat smooth muscle AT1a receptor is Asn298-Pro299-Leu300-Phe301-Tyr302 (10Murphy T.J.

Several G protein-coupled receptor models have been based on the structure of bacteriorhodopsin. This heptahelical membrane protein shares no sequence homology with mammalian G protein-coupled receptors, but it has an identical folding pattern and functional resemblance to mammalian opsins(11Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Bruinvels A. Hibert M. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3448-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The recently reported low resolution structural image of bovine rhodopsin (12Schertler G.F.X. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) has made it possible to further improve these models(9Donnelly D. Findlay J.B.C. Blundell T.L.

A recent model of aminergic G protein-coupled receptors suggests that the NPX2-3Y sequence is ideally placed to receive a signal from agonist-induced conformational changes in the ligand binding region(9Donnelly D. Findlay J.B.C. Blundell T.L. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 61-78PubMed Google Scholar, 14Findlay J.B.C. Donnelly D. Bhogal N. Hurrell C. Attwood T.K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This sequence is in close proximity to the functionally important asparagine-aspartic acid pair located in transmembrane segments 1 and 2 and may participate in important hydrogen bonding interactions. Most of the available models also predict that the highly conserved intramembrane proline residues, which disrupt the α-helical structure of the transmembrane domains, serve as hinges that participate in the agonist-induced conformation change of G protein-coupled receptors(9Donnelly D. Findlay J.B.C. Blundell T.L. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 61-78PubMed Google Scholar, 11Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Bruinvels A. Hibert M. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3448-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). One such proline residue is located within the seventh transmembrane domain in the conserved NPX2-3Y sequence, and this residue (Pro540) of the m3 muscarinic receptor has been found to be important for signal transduction(15Wess J. Nanavati S. Vogel Z. Maggio R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Another interesting feature of the NPX2-3Y sequence is its similarity to the NPXY internalization sequence that was first described in the cytoplasmic segment of the low density lipoprotein receptor(16Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In recent studies, the tyrosine residue in this sequence was found to be essential for sequestration of the β-adrenergic receptor (17Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not for the internalization of the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor(18Slice L.W. Wong H.C. Sternini C. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Walsh J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21755-21762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor and the AT1 receptors, unlike the β-adrenergic receptor, contain an additional aromatic amino acid (Phe321 and Phe301, respectively) in their NPX2-3Y sequences(1Bernstein K.E. Berk B.C. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1993; 22: 745-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Slice L.W. Wong H.C. Sternini C. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Walsh J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21755-21762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of such residue might be important since phenylalanine can substitute for the tyrosine residue in the NPXY internalization sequence of nutrient receptors(16Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The present study was performed to analyze the role of the NPX2-3Y sequence in ligand binding, internalization, and signaling of G protein-coupled receptors, utilizing the rat AT1a receptor as a model to evaluate its participation in these critical aspects of receptor function. The cDNA clone (pCa18b) of the rat smooth muscle AT1a receptor subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDM8 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth E. Bernstein(10Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Runge M.S. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Culture media were from Biofluids (Rockville, MD). The Medium 199 used in these experiments was modified to contain 3.6 mM K+, 1.2 mM Ca2+, 1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, and 20 mM HEPES. Lipofectin, lipofectamine and Opti-MEM I were from Life Technologies, Inc. Losartan was a gift from Dr. P. C. Wong (DuPont, Wilmington, DE). 125I-Ang II and [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II were obtained from Hazleton Laboratories (Vienna, VA) or DuPont NEN; [3H]inositol was from Amersham Corp. The rat AT1a receptor cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen) as described earlier(19Hunyady L. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24798-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant rat AT1a receptors were created using the Mutagene kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), which is based on the method of Kunkel et al.(20Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Each mutant contained a silent restriction site to facilitate the screening of colonies. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). All mutations were verified by dideoxy sequencing using Sequenase II (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mML-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To determine inositol phosphate responses, internalization kinetics, or [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding to intact cells, the cells were seeded in 24-well plates (50,000 cells/well) 3 days before transfection. Transient transfection was performed by replacing the culture medium with 0.5-ml aliquots of Opti-MEM I containing 8 μg of lipofectamine and 1 μg of plasmid DNA/well, or with increasing amounts of cDNA as indicated in the legend to Fig. 4. The cells were incubated for 5-6 h in this solution, and the medium was replaced with culture medium. For membrane binding studies, 106 cells were grown on 100-mm culture dishes for 3 days. Transfections were performed for 5-6 h using 5 ml of Opti-MEM I containing 16 μg/ml lipofectamine and 10 μg of plasmid DNA. After transfection, the medium was replaced with the culture medium. All experiments were performed 48 h after the initiation of the transfection procedure. To determine the expression level and structural integrity of the mutant receptor, the number of Ang II binding sites was determined by incubating the transfected cells with [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II (0.05-0.1 μCi/sample) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II in Medium 199 (HEPES) for 6 h at 4°C. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and the radioactivity associated with the cells was measured by γ-spectrometry after solubilization with 0.5 M NaOH, 0.05% SDS. The displacement curves were analyzed with the Ligand computer program using a one-site model(21Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed and scraped into 1.5 ml of ice-cold 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, and lysed by freezing. Crude membranes were prepared by centrifuging the samples at 16,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (containing 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)), and the protein content was determined. Binding assays were performed in 0.2 ml of binding buffer supplemented with 2 g/liter bovine serum albumin at 25°C. Each sample contained 0.05-0.1 μCi of 125I-Ang II or [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, 15-30 μg of crude membranes, and the indicated concentrations of unlabeled [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, losartan, or Ang II in the presence or absence of 5 μM GTPγS as indicated. After a 90-min incubation at 25°C, the unbound tracer was removed by rapid filtration, and the bound radioactivity was measured by γ-spectrometry. In these experiments, the culture medium was replaced 24 h after transfection with 0.5 ml of inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, 20 μCi/ml [3H]inositol, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin as described earlier(19Hunyady L. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24798-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 24 h of labeling, the cells were washed twice and incubated in inositol-free modified Medium 199 in the presence of 10 mM LiCl for 30 min at 37°C, and then stimulated with 30 nM Ang II for 20 min or, in the case of F301A, with 1 μM Ang II for 20 min. Incubations were stopped by adding perchloric acid (5% (v/v) final concentration). Inositol phosphates were extracted and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously(22Balla T. Sim S.S. Iida T. Choi K.Y. Catt K.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24719-24726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before each experiment the medium was replaced by Hepes-buffered Medium 199. To determine the internalization kinetics of the mutant and wild-type AT1a receptors 125I-Ang II (0.05-0.1 μCi) was added in the same medium, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for the indicated times. Incubations were stopped by placing the cells on ice and rapidly washing them twice with 1 ml of ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated for 10 min in 0.5 ml of acid wash solution (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM acetic acid) to remove the surface-bound radioligand. The supernatant containing the acid-released radioactivity was collected, and the cells were treated with 0.5 M NaOH and 0.05% SDS to solubilize the acid-resistant (internalized) radioactivity. The radioactivities were measured by γ spectrometry, and the percent of internalized ligand at each time point was calculated from the ratio of the acid-resistant binding to the total (acid-resistant + acid-released) binding. To determine the internalization kinetics of prelabeled receptors, the cells were incubated with 125I-Ang II (0.05-0.1 μCi) in 0.25 ml Medium 199 for 3-4 h at 4°C to permit binding in the absence of receptor internalization. The unbound tracer was removed by washing the cells twice with 1-ml aliquots of ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. After addition of 0.5 ml of warm (37°C) Medium 199, the cells were incubated for the indicated times at 37°C to allow internalization to proceed. Incubations were stopped by placing the cells on ice, and the medium containing the tracer released during the incubation was collected and replaced with 0.5 ml of ice-cold acid wash solution. The extracellular (acid-sensitive) and internalized tracer were measured as described above. The total binding was calculated as the sum of the released (into the medium), extracellular (acid-sensitive), and internalized (acid-resistant) radioactivities. The internalized or released radioactivity was expressed as a percent of the total binding at each time point. [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding was measured in intact COS-7 cells transfected with mutant or wild-type AT1a receptors to determine the expression level and the functional integrity of these receptors at the plasma membrane. As shown in, all mutant receptors analyzed in this study bound the antagonist radioligand with high affinity. It is interesting to note that all mutants in which Phe301 was replaced (F301A, L300A/F301A, F301A/Y302A, F301A/Y302A/F304A) showed slightly but consistently lower binding affinity than the other mutants or the wild-type receptor. The expression levels of the mutant receptors showed more significant variations. While alanine replacement for Asn298 and Tyr302 had no major effect on receptor expression, mutation of the three inner residues (Pro299, Leu300, and Phe301) reduced expression to approximately one-third of that of the wild-type receptor (Table I). The effect of amino acid replacement on receptor expression appeared to be additive, since L300A/F301A showed further reduction compared with L300A and F301A, and F301A/Y302A and F301A/Y302A/F304A showed progressively reduced expression levels compared with F301A or Y302A.Table I:Parameters of [125I-Sar8,Ile8]Ang II binding for wild-type and mutant AT1a receptors expressed in COS-7 cellsThe data are expressed as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments each performed in duplicate. Open table in a new tab The data are expressed as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments each performed in duplicate. Previous reports showed that the type 1 Ang II receptors can couple to multiple G proteins including Gq, Gi, and Go (1Bernstein K.E. Berk B.C. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1993; 22: 745-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To evaluate the ability of the AT1a receptor to couple to G proteins, we measured the effect of GTPγS on Ang II binding in COS-7 cell membranes. Addition of GTPγS (5 μM) caused a 3.45 ± 0.38-fold (n = 3) decrease in the affinity of the wild-type receptor for Ang II, indicating that the expressed AT1a receptor is coupled to G proteins. In the presence of the GTP analogue, when the receptor is uncoupled from G proteins, the binding affinities of the N298A, P299A, L300A, and Y302A mutants for Ang II were similar to that of the wild-type receptor (Table II). In the absence of GTPγS, the affinities of the mutants for Ang II were lower than that of the wild-type receptor, suggesting that receptor-G protein interaction is affected in these mutants. The GTPγS-induced change in affinity was most impaired in the N298A and P299A mutant receptors, but it was also evident in the Y302A mutant (Fig. 2). Interestingly, despite its near normal affinity for [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II (Table I), the F301A mutant receptor had significantly reduced affinity for the physiological agonist, Ang II (Table II).Table II:IC50 of 125I-Ang II binding in the absence or presence of 5 μM GTPγS and EC50 of the combined InsP2+ InsP3 responses for wild-type and mutant AT1a receptors expressed in COS-7 cellsThe binding data are expressed as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments each performed in duplicate.

Since both the expression levels (Table I) and the agonist affinity (Table II) of the F301A receptor were impaired, it was difficult to accurately characterize this mutant using 125I-Ang II as radioligand. For this reason, [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II was utilized to measure the binding properties of F301A. Consistent with the data obtained in intact cells, the F301A mutant receptor showed only slightly decreased affinity relative to the wild-type receptor when [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II was used to displace the radioligand (IC50: wild-type, 0.53 ± 0.09 nMversus F301A, 0.92 ± 0.05 nM; n = 3) (Fig. 3, upper panel). In contrast, the ability of the agonist ligand (Ang II) to displace [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II was reduced 9.7 ± 0.9-fold in the F301A mutant (IC50: wild-type, 3.0 ± 0.1 nMversus F301A, 29.5 ± 2.6 nM; n = 3) (Fig. 3, middle panel). This selective reduction of Ang II binding affinity was not related to impaired G protein coupling, since the effect of GTPγS on binding was similar to that observed in the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2). The nonpeptide AT1 receptor antagonist losartan inhibited [125I-Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding to the wild-type receptor with an IC50 of 26.6 ± 1.4 nM (n = 3). However, the affinity of the F301A mutant receptor for losartan was reduced 9.9 ± 2.5-fold (IC50, 263 ± 66 nM; n = 3) (Fig. 3, lower panel), similar to its loss of affinity for the native agonist, Ang II. To determine the ability of the mutant receptors to couple to phospholipase C via Gq and related proteins, we measured the inositol phosphate response of transfected COS-7 cells to Ang II in the presence of LiCl. As reported earlier, under these experimental conditions the major accumulating products of phosphoinositide hydrolysis are InsP2 and InsP3 in AT1a receptor-transfected COS-7 cells(19Hunyady L. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24798-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the expression levels of the mutant AT1a receptors showed significant variations (Table I), the relationship between receptor expression and the amplitude of the maximal inositol phosphate response was determined after transfecting COS-7 cells with increasing amounts of the wild-type AT1a receptor cDNA. Despite the wide range of receptor expression in such cells, there was a linear relationship (r = 0.98) between the measured extracellular receptor sites and the inositol phosphate responses to agonist stimulation (Fig. 4). This finding indicates that valid comparisons between cells expressing mutant AT1a receptors can be made by normalizing their inositol phosphate responses to the number of plasma membrane binding sites (Fig. 5, lower panel). The inositol phosphate responses of cells expressing mutant AT1a receptors were measured after maximal agonist stimulation with 30 nM Ang II. However, 1 μM Ang II was added in studies on the F301A receptor due to its reduced binding affinity for the native agonist. Single alanine replacements in the NPLFY sequence resulted in mutants showing various degrees of reduction of the inositol phosphate responses. The most prominent decrease was detected in the N298A, P299A, and F301A mutants during Ang II stimulation (Fig. 5). After normalization of the data to the receptor expression level, the impaired response of cells transfected with the F301A receptor was attributable to its lower expression level, while the L300A receptor appeared to activate phospholipase C more effectively than the wild-type receptor (Fig. 5, lower panel). The most significant impairment of inositol phosphate signaling was observed in COS-7 cells expressing the N298A receptor, which showed more than 60% reduction of inositol phosphate accumulation. However, the P299A and Y302A receptors also mediated consistently reduced inositol phosphate responses (Fig. 5, lower panel). Since binding studies revealed significant differences in the agonist affinities of the mutant AT1a receptors, a detailed analysis of the dose-dependence of their signaling responses was performed. The EC50 values for inositol phosphate responses of the wild-type and mutant AT1a receptors showed a good correlation with the respective IC50 values for inhibition of radioligand binding by native Ang II (Table II). For example the dose-response curve for Ang II-induced inositol phosphate production of the F301A mutant receptor was shifted to the right compared with that of the wild-type receptor, consistent with the reduced agonist affinity of this mutant (Fig. 6). However, the maximum level of stimulation mediated by the F301A receptor showed no reduction when the data were normalized for the reduced number of binding sites (Fig. 5, lower panel). On the other hand, the higher EC50 values observed in cells expressing the N298A receptor (Fig. 6) and the P299A and Y302A receptors (Table II) were paralleled by impaired G protein-coupling. This is indicated by the reduced maximal response (Fig. 5, lower panel) and decreased GTPγS effect on Ang II binding (Fig. 2) to these mutant receptors. The AT1a receptor expressed in COS-7 cells undergoes rapid agonist-induced internalization, similar to that of the native receptors of smooth muscle, adrenal glomerulosa, and other cell types(2Catt K.J.

Single alanine replacements in the NPLFY sequence caused relatively minor impairment of the internalization kinetics of the hormone-receptor complex (Fig. 7). While the rates of internalization of the N298A, F301A, and Y302A receptors were somewhat slower than that of the wild-type receptor, all mutant receptors showed rapid agonist-induced internalization, and the quantity of internalized radioligand exceeded that of extracellular binding after a 30-min incubation at 37°C (Fig. 7). In the low density lipoprotein receptor, the tyrosine residue of the NPXY motif can be replaced by phenylalanine with no loss of function of the internalization signal(16Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Since the AT1a receptor Tyr302 is preceded by a phenylalanine, the Y302A mutant contains an NPLF sequence that meets the criteria of an internalization signal. To evaluate the possibility that the neighboring phenylalanine residues could substitute for Tyr302 when the latter is replaced with alanine, double (F301A/Y302A) and triple (F301A/Y302A/F304A) alanine replacement mutants were analyzed. Like the F301A mutant receptor, these mutants showed reduced expression levels and slightly reduced antagonist binding (Table II) but exhibited markedly impaired agonist binding (data not shown). However, these mutant receptors underwent rapid agonist-induced endocytosis, indicating that the NPX2-3Y sequence is not a major determinant of the internalization of the AT1a receptor (Fig. 8). To further analyze the role of Tyr302 in the endocytosis of AT1a receptors, internalization kinetics were measured in cells prelabeled with 125I-Ang II. Prelabeling was performed at 4°C to prevent internalization of the radioligand as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After warming the cells to 37°C, more than 60% of the tracer bound to the wild-type receptor internalized within 5 min (Fig. 9, upper panel) similar to the previously reported rapid kinetics of endogenous AT1 receptors(23Griendling K.K.

At the same time (5 min), less than 20% of the radioactivity was released into the medium (Fig. 9, lower panel), indicating that dissociation of the agonist from the receptor is relatively slow in comparison with the rapid kinetics of the internalization process. The release of bound and internalized radioactivity into the incubation medium exhibited biphasic kinetics. As shown for the wild-type receptor (Fig. 9, lower panel), the initial phase of release, which is largely due to dissociation of the surface-bound ligand, began to plateau by 5 min, reflecting the concomitant decrease in"

With normal concentrations of potassium and sodium, both channels were highly selective for potassium. On removal of potassium, Kv2.1 displayed a large sodium conductance that was inhibited by low concentrations of potassium. The channel showed a competition mechanism of selectivity similar to that of calcium channels. In contrast, Kv1.5 displayed a negligible sodium conductance on removal of potassium. The observation that structurally similar potassium channels show different abilities to conduct sodium provides a basis for understanding the structural determinants of potassium channel selectivity."

Synaptic and extrasynaptic portions of the basal lamina contain different laminin beta chains: beta 2 (or s) at synapses and beta 1 (or B1) extrasynaptically. Laminin beta 2 is also confined to synapselike patches on myotube surfaces in vitro, whereas beta 1 is present throughout the extracellular matrix. This differential localization of laminin beta chains was analyzed by expression of chimeric beta 1-beta 2 molecules in cultured mouse myotubes. A 16-amino acid carboxyl-terminal sequence in beta 2 was necessary for synaptic localization, and an amino-terminal domain in beta 1 promoted association with extracellular fibrils. The synaptic targeting sequence of beta 2 contains a site previously shown to be adhesive for motor neurons."

Prior to the time of eye opening, lateral activation was restricted to a narrow columnar region. During the week following eye opening, the extent of lateral propagation of activity more than doubled. Selective interruption of specific pathways in the slice, combined with pharmacological and anatomical experiments, determined that this lateral propagation was mediated by horizontal projections made within layer 2/3. These results indicate that functional horizontal interactions emerge only after axons begin branching and in parallel with, but not prior to, the refinement of orientation selectivity."

CT exhibits negligible activity in vitro in the absence of lipid activators, and its stimulation by lipids is thought to contribute to controlling the activity of the enzyme in vivo.

The goal of the present work is to define the biochemical basis for the modulation of CT activity by the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain. The rat CT cDNA was provided by Dr. R. B. Cornell (18Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Lachance A. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

[32P]Orthophosphate (carrier-free) and phospho[methyl-14C]choline (specific activity 55 mCi/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. Cell culture media were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., and thin layer plates were from Analtech. Molecular biology reagents were obtained from Promega. The carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant pCTD312 was constructed and a PCR mutant was used to introduce an MscI site at bp 1040 of CT, and this mutant was subcloned into pBlueBacIII. The region between bp 1040 and bp 1342 was deleted by digestion of the resulting plasmid with MscI/NotI. The NotI site was filled with Klenow fragment, and the plasmid was religated. In this construct, the codons for Gln-312 through Asp-367 were deleted, and the codons for five additional amino acid residues (Leu-Gly-Pro-His-Ala) were added after the codon for Leu-311. The SacI/BamHI fragment of rat CT (0.57 kilobase) was subcloned into pBS and used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant primer was designed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence between bp 1038 to bp 1058 which contains the codon for Ser-315 of CT. The primer, GGCCATCgcTCCCAAGCAGAG, substituted the original AGT codon for Ser-315 with GCT and thus changed Ser-315 to Ala-315. PCR site-directed mutagenesis used the mutant primer and the M13 reverse primer to generate the first round PCR product. The first round PCR product was then used together with the M13 forward primer to generate the second round PCR product(37Liang P. Pardee A.B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strugh K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 15.0.3-15.8.7Google Scholar). The second round PCR product was precipitated with ethanol and digested by SacI/BamHI. The digested fragment (0.57 kilobase) was ligated into the pBS plasmid, and the DNA sequence was confirmed. The mutated SacI/BamHI fragment of CT was isolated and co-ligated with digested pGEMEX-1 (SalI/BamHI), and the SalI/SacI fragment was isolated from pCT-N/B. This construct was denoted as pGEMEX-1CTS315A and contained the full coding region of CT with a S315A point mutation. The NcoI/HindIII fragment of pGEMEX-1CTS315A was inserted into pBlueBacIII. This construct was denoted as pCTS315A and used to generate the baculovirus that expressed the CT[S315A] mutant protein. The presence of the mutation and absence of other changes in the nucleotide sequence were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Sweitzer and Kent (26Sweitzer T.D. Kent C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) reported that the original rat CT cDNA was a cloning artifact containing 2 incorrect bases generating a G91S and C114S mutant. These mutations were removed from our constructs by replacing the EcoRI/StyI fragment (bp 189-783) of the rat CT cDNA clone with the corresponding fragment of the murine CT cDNA. Endogenous lipids were removed from the CT preparation by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography as described previously(17Boggs K.P. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The standard CT activity assay contained the delipidated CT, CT[S315A], or CT[Δ312-367] fraction (0.4-2 μg of protein) in a final volume of 40 μl containing 120 mM bis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 1 mM phospho[methyl-14C]choline (0.5 μCi), 2 mM CTP, 80 μM PtdCho/18:1 (1:1). The reaction was for 10 min at 37°C and was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 M EDTA and incubated on ice. CDP-[14C]choline formation was determined by thin layer chromatography(36Luche M.M. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Protein was determined according to the method of Bradford(38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The degree of cooperative binding of CT to PtdCho/18:1 or PtdCho/DAG vesicles was determined by analyzing the data according to a transformation of the Hill equation: log [(v/(Vmax - v)] = nHlog[A] - logK, where v is the CT catalytic rate, Vmax is the CT maximum catalytic rate, nH is the Hill coefficient constant, A is the concentration of lipid activator, and K is a constant(39Dixon M.

Linear correlation coefficients for the data used to determine the slope (nH) in the Hill plots exceeded 0.98 in all cases. Vmax values used in the Hill plots were determined independently by double reciprocal plots using the data obtained with 40-120 μM PtdCho/oleate (1:1) or 1-32 μM PtdCho/DAG (3:1). The Kmvalues for CTP or phosphocholine were obtained from the Michaelis-Menten equation by a double reciprocal plot of 1/V versus 1/S at 80 μM PtdCho/18:1 (1:1). To biochemically characterize CT and its carboxyl-terminal modifications, these three proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells following infection with recombinant baculoviruses(36Luche M.M. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The endogenous lipids were removed, the proteins were partially purified by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, and the purity and relative levels of CT, CT[S315A], and CT[Δ312-367] in these preparations are shown in Fig. 1A. The CT band was always less distinct than either the CT[S315A] or CT[Δ312-367] band since two isoforms of wild-type CT were present in Sf9 cells and the more extensively phosphorylated CT isoform migrates slightly slower than the less extensively phosphorylated form of CT(40Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of CT, CT[S315A], and CT[Δ312-367] phosphorylation was determined by labeling the Sf9 cells with [32P]orthophosphate and immunoprecipitating the CT proteins from the cell lysates (Fig. 1B). CT and CT[S315A] were extensively phosphorylated in this experiment, whereas 32P label was not incorporated into the CT[Δ312-367] mutant. These data are consistent with the results of MacDonald and Kent (21MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who used analytical techniques to demonstrate that the extensive phosphorylation of CT expressed in Sf9 cells was localized to the carboxyl-terminal domain. Therefore, in our experiments, a mixture of phosphorylated CT isoforms are produced by Sf9 cells, and our kinetic analysis reflects the average property of the mixture. The kinetic substrate affinities calculated for CT, CT[S315A], and CT[Δ312-367] were similar (Table I). The apparent CTP Km calculated from double-reciprocal plots was 0.3 mM for CT, 0.2 mM for CT[S315A], and 0.5 mM for CT[Δ312-367]. The apparent phosphocholine Km was 0.7 mM for CT, 0.8 mM for CT[S315A], and 0.5 mM for CT[Δ312-367]. These data indicated that there was little difference between wild-type, CT[S315A], and truncated CT with respect to the interaction between the substrates and the enzymes.Table I:Kinetic affinity constants for CT, CT[S315A], and CT[Δ312-367] Open table in a new tab The regulation of CT activity by lipid activators was examined following the removal of endogenous lipids from the protein preparation by ion exchange chromatography. CT and CT[Δ312-367] exhibited essentially no activity following removal of the endogenous lipids. The most potent lipid activators of CT are anionic compounds typified by 18:1. Both enzymes were significantly stimulated by the presence of PtdCho/18:1 vesicles (Fig. 2A), and the lipid activation kinetics were analyzed by double reciprocal plots (Fig. 2B). There was a significant discrepancy between the activities of the two proteins at PtdCho/18:1 concentrations above 4 μM (Fig. 2A), indicating that CT became refractory to activation at higher lipid concentrations compared to CT[Δ312-367]. Consistent with this interpretation, the double-reciprocal plots were not linear (Fig. 2B) indicating cooperative interactions between lipid activators and the enzymes. Analysis of the data using the Hill equation (Fig. 2C) indicated that there were two factors that contributed to the enhanced activity of CT[Δ312-367] compared to CT. First, the Km values for PtdCho/18:1 vesicles calculated from the Hill plots were 51 μM for CT and 17 μM for CT[Δ312-367] (Table I) illustrating that the truncated enzyme was more sensitive to lipid activators. Second, CT exhibited negative cooperativity (nH = 0.64), whereas the Hill coefficient (nH = 1.11) for CT[Δ312-367] did not indicate negative cooperativity. CT is also activated by the nonionic lipid, DAG, incorporated into PtdCho vesicles(4Cornell R. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 919: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 5Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5873-5880Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5881-5888Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and CT activity in vivo may be regulated by the levels of DAG in the membrane(24Hatch G.M. Jamil H. Utal A.K. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15751-15758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Jamil H. Utal A.K. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1752-1760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Utal A.K. Jamil H. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24084-24091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed the same kinetic analysis comparing the stimulation of CT and CT[Δ312-367] by PtdCho/DAG vesicles. Both CT and CT[Δ312-367] were activated by PtdCho/DAG (Fig. 2D), and, as in the case with PtdCho/18:1, CT[Δ312-367] was stimulated to a greater extent at lower PtdCho/DAG concentrations. Analysis of the activation curves by double reciprocal plots (Fig. 2E) indicated that CT activation by PtdCho/DAG exhibited negative cooperativity, whereas CT[Δ312-367] activation appeared to more closely obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The Hill plots (Fig. 2F) showed that the Hill coefficient for CT was 0.76, whereas CT[Δ312-367] had a Hill coefficient of 0.93. However, the most striking difference between the two enzymes was the apparent Km for PtdCho/DAG activator (Table I). The apparent Km for CT[Δ312-367] was 6 μM, almost an order of magnitude lower than the 45 μMKm for CT. Thus, the presence of the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain in CT reduced the affinity of the enzyme for PtdCho/DAG activator and induced negative cooperative binding to PtdCho/DAG, consistent with the conclusions drawn from the analysis of enzyme regulation by PtdCho/18:1 (see above). We attempted to dephosphorylate CT and assess its kinetic properties. Although we were able to effectively dephosphorylate CT using acid phosphatase(40Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the recovery of CT activity from these reactions was always <2%, thus preventing the further detailed analysis of enzyme kinetics. Other phosphatases were less effective in dephosphorylating CT, and recovery of activity was poor in all cases. Ser-315 is a major phosphorylation site in CT expressed in Sf9 cells (21MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is the phosphorylation site closest to the putative lipid binding helical domain(18Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Lachance A. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6029-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To test the importance of this particular site and to verify that negative cooperativity was a property associated with the phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus, the CT[S315A] mutant was constructed, expressed in Sf9 cells, and the kinetics of lipid activation were measured. Although CT[S315A] was a phosphoprotein (Fig. 1), the kinetics of CT[S315A] activation by PtdCho/18:1 was a good fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation and the Hill plot showed reduced negative cooperativity compared to CT (Fig. 3A). The same kinetic analysis was applied to the activation of CT[S315A] by PtdCho/DAG (Fig. 3B), and, again, CT[S315A] exhibited a lower degree of negative cooperativity compared to CT. In both cases, the Hill coefficient for CT[S315A] was intermediate between CT and CT[Δ312-367] indicating that phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain was responsible for the negative cooperativity associated with CT. Most importantly, the Km values for the lipid activation of CT[S315A] were intermediate between the higher Km values exhibited by CT and the lower Km values exhibited by CT[Δ312-367] (Table I). Thus, the kinetic constants of CT[S315A] were between those of CT and CT[Δ312-367]. These data are consistent with the idea that the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of CT modulates enzyme activation by lipid regulators. CT and a truncated mutant lacking the entire carboxyl-terminal domain both require specific lipids for activity and have similar kinetic constants for the two substrates, CTP and phosphocholine. However, there are significant differences between the two proteins with respect to the kinetics of lipid activation. The Km values for the two lipid activator mixtures are lower for CT[Δ312-367] than for CT, and, in addition, CT activation exhibits pronounced negative cooperativity with respect to the two lipid regulators, whereas the CT[Δ312-367] mutant does not. To verify that the effects on the Km and negative cooperativity arise from the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain, the phosphorylation state of CT was modified by eliminating a major phosphorylation site. The CT[S315A] mutant has affinities for lipid activator mixtures that lie between CT and CT[Δ312-367] illustrating that changes in the phosphorylation state can account for the differences in CT regulation by lipid activators. Thus, our results indicate that the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain both decreases the affinity of the enzyme for lipid regulators and induces negative cooperativity."
https://openalex.org/W1994426538,"Homologs of the Drosophila clock gene per have recently been cloned in Lepidopteran and Blattarian insect species. To assess the extent to which clock mechanisms are conserved among phylogenetically distant species, we determined whether PER protein from the silkmoth Antheraea pernyi can function in the Drosophila circadian timing system. When expressed in transgenic Drosophila, the silkmoth PER protein is detected in the expected neural cell types, with diurnal changes in abundance that are similar to those observed in wild-type fruitflies. Behavioral analysis demonstrates that the silkmoth protein can serve as a molecular element of the Drosophila clock system; expression of the protein shortens circadian period in a dose-dependent manner and restores pacemaker functions to arrhythmic per0 mutants. This comparative study also suggests that the involvement of PER in different aspects of circadian timing, such as period determination, strength of rhythmicity, and clock out-put, requires distinct molecular interactions."

Protein components of vaults isolated from Dictyostelium discoideum migrate on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as two bands, one at 94 kDa (MvpA) and the other at 92 kDa (MvpB). An MvpB cDNA clone was isolated from a Dictyostelium expression library. MvpB shares 60% identity with MvpA at the amino acid level. This cDNA has been used to disrupt the single mvpB gene in both wild-type and mvpA− genetic backgrounds.

The resulting mutant cell lines reach stationary phase in suspension culture at one-third of the density of wild-type cells. Ovoid structures isolated from mvp− single mutant lines represent what remains of vaults in these cells. Similar ovoid structures isolated from the mvpA−mvpB− line copurify with a newly identified protein of 92 kDa (MvpC), which lacks cross-reactivity with currently available anti-vault antibodies.

A variety of techniques including cryoelectron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and negative staining have been used to determine the particle's dimensions. Although values vary depending on the technique employed, the latter two procedures show rat vaults to have dimensions of ~35 × 60 nm(1Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J.

When spread on polylysine-coated mica, these two centers of mass split apart, and each barrel half unfolds into a flower-like structure. Each flower is composed of eight rectangular petals linked by short hooks to a central ring(3Kedersha N.L. Miquel M.-C. Bittner D. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although generally cytoplasmic, vault subpopulations have been detected by immunofluorescence at the ruffling edges of spreading rat fibroblasts and along cytoskeletal fibers, suggesting a possible role in motility(2Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1990; 14: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Vault association with nuclei has been demonstrated by immunofluorescence on nuclei isolated from rat liver and Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba. The association appears to be specific as it survives washes with 0.5 M NaCl and 1% Triton X-100(7Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. Kedersha N.L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 23-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Although the specific function of vaults is unknown, the 8-fold symmetry, size, dimensions, and immunolocalization suggest a possible function for vaults as the transiently associated central plug/transporter of the nuclear pore complex(3Kedersha N.L.

Certainly, the conservation of vault morphology between organisms as diverse as rat and Dictyostelium indicates an important and ubiquitous cellular role. Vaults have been successfully purified from a number of species and characterized most extensively in rat and Dictyostelium(1Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J.

Isolation and characterization of vRNAs from various organisms including rat and bullfrog have revealed conserved sequences. Moreover, the strong conservation of the predicted secondary structure between the vRNAs suggests that the folded configuration may be important for vRNA function(5Kickhoefer V.A. Searles R.P. Kedersha N.L. Garber M.E. Johnson D.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7868-7873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the vault particle affords protection to the vRNA from ribonucleases, it can be digested by prolonged treatment with high ribonuclease activity. Removal of the vRNA in intact vaults does not interfere with vault morphology (determined by electron microscopy) or mobility on nonsieving agarose gels, indicating that the vRNA is not required for the maintenance of vault structure(1Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).

Dictyostelium vault proteins separate on SDS-PAGE into two bands migrating at 94 and 92 kDa. Since other eukaryotic organisms display only a single major vault protein (Mvp) species, the Dictyostelium doublet was initially considered likely to be the product of differential processing or modification of a single gene product. Subsequent investigation revealed two unique major proteins, MvpA (94 kDa) and MvpB (92 kDa)(6Vasu S. Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15356-15360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we reported the isolation of a cDNA encoding the MvpA protein(6Vasu S. Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15356-15360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of MvpA to sequences in GenBank at the DNA and amino acid levels showed MvpA to be unique. MvpA contains none of the known RNA-binding domains and appears to play a predominantly structural role in the particle. Disruption of the gene encoding MvpA is not a lethal event. The resulting mvpA− cell line, M3, shows no obvious abnormalities in either growth or development under optimal culture conditions. However, vaults purified from M3 cells lack the characteristic barrel-shaped morphology of normal structures(6Vasu S. Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15356-15360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From this result, we concluded that although MvpA is required for normal vault structure, its presence is probably dispensable for vault function. In this study, we report the isolation of a cDNA encoding the 92-kDa major vault protein, MvpB. Screens of GenBank at the protein and DNA levels show MvpB's similarity to MvpA(6Vasu S. Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15356-15360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the 104-kDa rat MVP(8Kickhoefer V.A. Rome L.H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and a partial human cDNA sequence isolated as an expressed sequence tag. We have now disrupted the gene encoding MvpB in both wild-type and mvpA− genetic backgrounds. Characterization of these Mvp-negative lines reveals a growth defect phenotype under suboptimal culture conditions. We also identify a novel 92-kDa protein that copurifies with the ovoid structures isolated from the mvpA−mvpB− double mutant line. Unlike MvpB, this 92-kDa protein is only poorly recognized by the currently available anti-Dictyostelium vault antibody. We believe that this protein represents a novel vault protein and are currently characterizing it and investigating its role in vault structure and function. An M3 Dictyostelium cDNA expression library was constructed in λ-ZAP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Poly(A)+ mRNA was prepared from M3 cells (6Vasu S. Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15356-15360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and submitted to the UCLA Mental Retardation Research Center Core Facility for library construction. The library was screened using polyclonal anti-Dictyostelium vault antiserum. Plasmid clones were purified away from phage suspension according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequence analysis was performed as described(9Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52511) Google Scholar).

The haploid strain JH010 was a gift from Dr. Richard Firtel (University of California at San Diego). The relevant genotype of JH010 is mvpA mvpB thy-1−. The strains M6A−, M7A−B−, and M12B− were constructed and maintained using previously described methods(6Vasu S. Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol.

HL-5 and SM/5 liquid culture media were prepared as described(11Cocucci S. Sussman M. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 45: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 12Spudich J.A.

All enzymes were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. or Promega. An MvpB cDNA isolate, p8A1, missing 150 base pairs from the 5’-end was excised from λ-ZAP in Bluescript according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The plasmid pGEM-25, containing the Dictyostelium thy-1 gene, was a gift of Dr. Wolfgang Nellen (Max-Planck-Institut fur Biochemie). The intact thy-1 gene was isolated from pGEM-25 as a 3.8-kb HindIII fragment and blunted with Klenow fragment DNA polymerase I. p8A1 was digested with EcoRV, eliminating all MvpB coding sequence except for 1.5 kb from the 5’-end. The blunted thy-1 gene was inserted into EcoRV-digested p8A1. The resulting plasmid, pMvpBTHY, consists of only the truncated 5’ 1.5 kb of MvpB coding sequence followed by the thy-1 gene in Bluescript pSK−. To facilitate isolation of an MvpB cDNA, a cDNA library was constructed from the mvpA− M3 strain (see “Materials and Methods”). A positive clone was isolated by immunoscreening the library with a polyclonal anti-Dictyostelium vault antibody. The clone was sequenced and found to share 73% identity at the nucleic acid level with MvpA cDNA. The cDNA contains a full-length open reading frame that encodes a protein with 60% identity at the amino acid level to MvpA (Fig. 1). The similarity to MvpA and the rat MVP throughout the entire sequence confirms this cDNA as MvpB. MvpB shares ~50% identity with the 104-kDa rat MVP(8Kickhoefer V.A. Rome L.H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Blocks of amino acid sequence identities previously shown to be conserved between MvpA and the rat MVP are maintained in MvpB. As expected, searches of GenBank identified MvpA and the rat MVP. However, additional searches using the rat MVP revealed three partial human cDNA sequences, each sharing ~85% identity with the rat MVP. These related sequences, isolated as expressed sequence tags, presumably represent a single cDNA clone for the human major vault protein. As is the case with MvpA, MvpB contains no motifs or domains that might give a clue as to the protein's function. Analysis of the translated cDNA using the Motif algorithm (14Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11535) Google Scholar) revealed only potential phosphorylation and glycosylation sites. However, the residues that compose these sites include five or fewer amino acids and would be expected to occur randomly in many unmodified proteins. Furthermore, vault proteins in the rat hepatoma cell line H4 are not phosphorylated when metabolically labeled in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate(1Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To determine if vault proteins are subject to O-linked glycosylation that occurs on certain cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, purified Dictyostelium vault samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin. None of the vault proteins were reactive with the plant lectin and thus appeared to be unmodified with O-linked sugars (data not shown). The mvpB gene disruption vector, pMvpBTHY, was electroporated into JH010 cells (mvpA mvpB thy-1−), and mvpA mvpB−thy-1 transformants were selected in 100-mm tissue culture dishes in the absence of thymidine supplementation(10Dynes J.L. Firtel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7966-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Foci were cultured in 24-well plates and screened by Western analysis for the absence of MvpB. Experience with the mvpA knockouts suggested that <10% of the transformed foci would represent targeted integrations. Moreover, as pMvpBTHY contains 2-fold more thy-1 sequence than mvpB sequence, we expected to see only one mvpB disruption for every two integrations at the mutant thy-1− locus. Western analysis showed that all but two out of 86 thy-1 foci screened contained both the immunoreactive 94- and 92-kDa Mvp bands. One line, M12B−, revealed no detectable MvpB protein by Western analysis on crude cell lysate (Fig. 2, lane 3). The mvpA gene was disrupted in JH010 in order to generate an MvpA-negative line in the same parental line as the mvpB− single mutant. This line was subsequently used in the production of an mvpA−mvpB− double mutant. The plasmid pMvpANEO was electroporated into JH010, and transformants were selected in the presence of G418 (10 μg/ml) as described previously(6Vasu S. Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15356-15360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A candidate line, M6A−, which produced no detectable MvpA, was isolated by screening transformants by Western blotting crude lysates (Fig. 2, lane 2). No MvpA transcript could be detected (Fig. 3, lane 3). In this line, the 7.0-kb HindIII fragment that contains mvpA is split into 3.6- and 5.4-kb fragments (Fig. 4). The mvpB gene in M6A− continues to produce a normally sized MvpB protein and transcript (Fig. 2(lane 2) and 3 (lane 7)).Figure 4:Disruption of mvpA− in M6A−. Ten μg of JH010 or M6A− genomic DNA was digested with HindIII, electrophoresed, transferred, and probed with a 200-base pair internal BglII fragment isolated from the MvpA cDNA. Lane 1, JH010; lane 2, M6A−. The 7-kb HindIII fragment shown in lane 1 contains the entire mvpA gene in JH010. This fragment is split in M6A− into 3.6- and 5.4-kb fragments, revealing the disruption of the gene.

Transformants were selected in the absence of thymidine supplementation as described above. Potential positives were screened by Western analysis for the absence of MvpB. One isolate, M7A−B−, produced no 94-kDa MvpA or 92-kDa MvpB protein as detected by Western analysis of total cell lysate (Fig. 2, lane 4). Anti-Dictyostelium vault antiserum did identify a band of ~80 kDa in crude M7A−B− lysate. This immunoreactive band is not present in protein extracts of the parental line, M6A−. We do not see this band in M12B− cells, which contain an mvpB gene disruption similar to the one in M7A−B− cells. However, the mvpB disruption in the double mutant line may be subtly different enough to allow low level expression of MvpB coding sequence remaining downstream of the mvpB promoter in M7A−B− cells (see Fig. 7B). In any case, the M7A−B− cell line can be considered deficient in MvpB since this immunoreactive protein is smaller than the known Mvps and does not associate with vaults in this cell line (see below). In all three mutants, integration of the gene disruption plasmid recreated Mvp coding sequence downstream of the affected mvp gene. In the case of the mvpB disruptions, this sequence lacks 150 bases of 5’-coding information. We do not discount the remote possibility that these lines might be producing trace amounts of Mvp from recreated downstream coding sequences using fortuitous promoters in the adjacent plasmid. We have, therefore, designated these lines as simply being Mvp-negative. However, with the possible exception of the non-vault-associated 80-kDa band in M7A−B−, we cannot detect protein products of disrupted mvp genes in mutant cell lysates by Western analysis or proteins associated with purified mutant vaults by silver staining or by Western analysis. The restriction map of the wild-type mvpB gene was established in the parental line, JH010. Digestion of JH010 genomic DNA with a variety of restriction enzymes that do not cut within the MvpB coding sequence generated single bands of even intensity on Southern blots probed with the full-length MvpB cDNA (Fig. 5). This result indicates that mvpB, like mvpA, is a single copy gene. Digestion with DraI and HindIII (Fig. 6A) generates the restriction map shown in Fig. 6B. The entire mvpB coding sequence is contained within a 2.8-kb DraI fragment (Fig. 6A).Figure 6:Restriction map of the undisrupted mvpB gene. The mvpB gene was mapped in JH010 genomic DNA with respect to DraI and HindIII restriction enzyme sites known to exist in the cDNA. A, genomic Southern blot. Ten μg of DNA was digested with DraI (D; lane 1) or HindIII (H; lanes 2 and 3). Lanes 1 and 2 were hybridized with probe 2. Lane 3 was hybridized with probe 1. Probes are indicated in the map in B and are described below. B, restriction map. The gray box represents the mvpB coding region. Black bars below the gene indicate sites recognized by hybridization probes.

Restriction fragment sizes are indicated in kilobase pairs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MvpB cDNA probes specific to the 5’- and 3’-ends of the MvpB coding sequence were used to map mvpB− in the mutants created above. Disruption of mvpB was demonstrated by the loss of the wild-type 2.8-kb DraI fragment (Fig. 7A) in M7A−B− and M12B− genomic DNAs. The coding sequence contained within the DraI fragment is now distributed between an upstream 2.4-kb fragment and a downstream 4.0-kb fragment (Fig. 7A). Digestion with HindIII generates a 7.2-kb fragment consistent with the integration of plasmid pMvpBTHY into mvpB (Fig. 7, A and B). No MvpB transcript can be detected on high stringency Northern blots of M12B− or M7A−B− total RNA (see Fig. 3). However, at low stringency, a larger (3 kb), weakly hybridizing band appears (data not shown). This could represent cross-hybridization with an RNA related to MvpB. However, as the mvpB promoter faces 1.5 kb of truncated MvpB coding sequence followed by the thy-1 gene cassette, this signal could represent an unstable transcript containing the 5’-end of the MvpB coding sequence fused to noncoding genomic DNA preceding the thy-1 gene. This transcript may result in expression of the amino-terminal half of MvpB, which may represent the 80-kDa protein seen in M7A−B− crude homogenates. The viability of Mvp-negative cells demonstrates that the loss of major vault protein(s) is not a lethal event. However, to evaluate the overall health of these lines, their growth rates were measured and compared with that of the parental line, JH010. Cells were inoculated into the rich broth HL-5 at a density of 1 × 104 cells/ml, and duplicate flasks of each line were incubated at room temperature, with shaking at 80 rpm. Duplicate aliquots were removed at ~24 h intervals, and cells were counted on a hemocytometer. Samples were taken until the cells reached stationary phase. The experiment was repeated, and the results were averaged and plotted (Fig. 8A). The growth curves indicate that, as tested under these optimal axenic growth conditions, all cell lines exhibit roughly equivalent growth kinetics. Growth rates of all lines were also evaluated under nutritionally challenging conditions. Although vegetative cells generally divide every 10 h in rich media, their doubling rates slow if the concentration of media additives such as peptone or phosphate drop (12Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 3-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The growth of the three cell lines was measured in the minimal sporulation medium SM/5(13Sussman M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1961; 25: 375-378Crossref Google Scholar). Although parental and mutant lines display slowed growth in the minimal medium, their initial growth rates appear comparable. However, by late log phase, as the cells reach a density of ~106 cells/ml, Mvp-negative lines begin to lag behind JH010. The mutant lines reach a final culture density that is, at most, only one-third that of the parent (Fig. 8B). As with wild-type cells, the mutant cultures lyse after reaching stationary phase. Thus, growth in SM/5 reduces doubling times and reveals a minor growth defect in Mvp-negative lines. Assuming vault function is essential to eukaryotic cells, this growth defect suggests that vault function has only been impaired but not abolished in Mvp-negative cells. This defect does not appear to prevent the cells from proceeding through their normal developmental program as plating mutant and wild-type lines on SM/5 agar reveals apparently equivalent abilities to aggregate, form migrating slugs and generate fruiting bodies. Additionally, it would appear that loss of both MvpA and MvpB has no greater impact on vault function than loss of a single Mvp as M7A−B− growth is comparable to that of M6A− and M12B− under the conditions of our study. As reported previously, M3 cells contain only MvpB and do not contain characteristic lobular vaults. Attempts to purify vaults from these cells yield an irregularly ovoid structure with dimensions of 30 × 40 nm (Fig. 9B)(6Vasu S. Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15356-15360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ovoid vaults were also isolated from M12B− cells and examined by negative staining under an electron microscope. The structures present in this MvpB-negative line are indistinguishable from those isolated from M3 (Fig. 9, B and C). These structures are slightly smaller than normal vaults, which have dimensions of 35 × 65 nm. The lack of topological definition in these structures may result from a loss of structural rigidity due to the absence of one or more Mvps, an idea supported by the fact that the structures are only crudely ovoid, lacking any obvious morphological regularity. In addition, the ovoid structures appear to exist in two forms: a monomeric ovoid and an apparent dimer of two structures separated by a dividing furrow. These monomer and dimer structures are highly reminiscent of the whole and half vaults found in wild-type cells (Fig. 9A)(6Vasu S. Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15356-15360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar ovoid structures have been isolated from all mvp− mutant lines reported here, including M7A−B−, which lacks both MvpA and MvpB (Fig. 9D). The complete loss of normal vaults upon the loss of either MvpA or MvpB indicates that both proteins are required to produce and maintain the lobular morphology of normal vaults. The loss of either results in the generation of the amorphous ovoid structure. We attempted to identify the ovoids as vaults under an electron microscope by use of gold-labeled affinity-purified anti-Dictyostelium vault antibodies. However, the results were unsatisfactory for technical reasons as the available anti-Dictyostelium vault antibody fails to detect even normal vaults under the various staining conditions that were attempted. The structures from M6A− were shown to cofractionate with the MvpB protein peak in the final step of vault purification. Ovoids were isolated using the published Dictyostelium vault purification protocol and fractionated over a 10-50% sucrose step gradient(6Vasu S. Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15356-15360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that the ovoid structures occur in gradient fractions containing MvpB and fractionate differentially from the actin filaments (common contaminants at this stage of purification), suggesting that the structures contain MvpB (data not shown). Demonstration that ovoid particles represent mutant vaults was achieved in a comparison of ovoid and normal Dictyostelium vault morphologies after various denaturing treatments to which normal rat vaults are impervious(2Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1990; 14: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). While structural integrity and morphology are unaffected by incubation of rat vaults at room temperature (22°C), wild-type Dictyostelium vaults subjected to the same treatment convert from the normal lobular morphology to the ovoid form seen in Mvp-negative mutants (Fig. 10, A and B). Conversion is apparently not due to degradation of either MvpA or MvpB since both proteins appear intact as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of the converted vaults (data not shown). Conversion appears to be an all or none phenomenon as we do not observe partially converted intermediates. This conversion is evidence that the ovoids that copurify with the MvpB protein in M3 and with the MvpA protein in M12B− represent what remains of vault structure in these Mvp-negative cells. In M7A−B−, the 80-kDa truncated MvpB protein (Fig. 2, lane 4) is not a component of vaults as it does not pellet from a crude cell lysate at 100,000 × g with microsomes and vaults (data not shown). However, despite the absence of both full-length MvpA and MvpB, ovoid vaults are still present in this line. These structures can be purified by standard vault purification techniques and are visually indistinguishable from vaults found in mvpA− and mvpB− lines. Vaults isolated from M7A−B− cells and analyzed on Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels fractionate with a protein that migrates at 92 kDa, approximately the same position as MvpB. Unlike MvpB, this novel 92-kDa protein, MvpC, is only weakly recognized by anti-Dictyostelium vault antiserum on Western blots of purified M7A−B− vaults (Fig. 11, B and C). Dictyostelium is the only organism (with the possible exception of rabbit) known to contain more than one Mvp. Vault proteins isolated from this organism, designated MvpA and MvpB, migrate as a doublet at 92-94 kDa on SDS-PAGE(2Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1990; 14: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The first evidence that the Dictyostelium Mvp doublet represented multiple gene products was provided by the anti-rat polyclonal vault antibody's differential reactivity against MvpA versus MvpB. MvpB lacks epitopes recognized by the anti-rat vault antibody that are present in MvpA. Since the Mvps are apparently unmodified, this result was the first indication that the two Mvps were derived from different genes. The first Mvp cDNA to be isolated maps to a single copy gene, whose disruption eliminates only MvpA transcript and protein. Since these cells continue to produce MvpB, this second Mvp is a unique gene product. The divergence between mvpA and mvpB is demonstrated by the failure of MvpA cDNA probes to detect the MvpB transcript on blots of M3 total RNA. MvpB cDNA probes are insufficiently similar to mvpA gene sequences to allow cross-detection of mvpA on high stringency genomic Southern blots. Subsequent isolation and analysis of the MvpB cDNA revealed MvpB to be only 60% similar to MvpA at the amino acid level. The extent to which the proteins differ outside of the conserved regions suggests that these divergent areas either are not functionally imperative domains or are functionally divergent. Cell lines lacking either or both MvpA and MvpB show no morphological, developmental, or growth defects under permissive culture conditions. This finding suggests that MvpA and MvpB are not required components of vaults. However, when placed under nutritional stress, mvp− lines display a mild growth defect. Thus, vault function in the mutant lines is likely to be at least partially impaired. Losing two Mvps does not seem to increase the magnitude of the growth defect over the loss of a single Mvp. Thus, the impediment to vault function is presumably equivalent in both single and double mvp− mutant lines. Whether this impediment is due to loss of Mvp-mediated function or to a reduction in the particle's structural integrity is unclear. Vaults isolated from mvp− lines can be visualized under an electron microscope as ovoid structures that lack any of the symmetry or lobular morphology characteristic of normal vaults. No characteristic lobular vaults were found in either mvpA− or mvpB− lines by electron microscopy, indicating that both proteins are required for normal vault structure. The absence of discernible nonlobular ovoid vaults in wild-type cells suggests that these structures represent Mvp-deficient particles and not a naturally occurring subclass of vaults composed of a single Mvp species. Demonstration that normal Dictyostelium vaults can be induced by temperature shift to undergo transformation into ovoid structures verifies that these structures represent vaults. In all mutant lines, ovoid vaults fractionate with remaining unaltered Mvps. Surprisingly, ovoid vaults could also be isolated from the mvpA−mvpB− double mutant line, indicating that MvpA and MvpB are not the sole components of Dictyostelium vaults. The M7A−B− ovoid vaults copurify with a single 92-kDa protein that is very poorly detected by available anti-Dictyostelium vault antisera. This protein, which we have designated MvpC, appears to lack epitopes conserved between not only MvpA and MvpB of Dictyostelium, but also Mvps of rat and Xenopus (data not shown). The failure of MvpA and MvpB cDNA probes to detect MvpC message on Northern blots of total RNA from mvpA− and mvpB− cells reflects this divergence. MvpC's structural divergence suggests functional divergence as well. This protein could represent an additional or partially redundant functional element in the Dictyostelium vault. Alternatively, all three Mvps may exhibit partial functional redundancy, and any one Mvp may be able to compensate for the loss of the other two proteins. Finally, it is also possible that MvpC is not normally a component of Dictyostelium vaults and has been induced in the Mvp-negative lines. This idea is supported by the fact that our current anti-Dictyostelium vault antibody, which was made against whole wild-type Dictyostelium vaults, cross-reacts poorly with MvpC. Isolation of an MvpC cDNA will be the first key step in characterizing this new vault protein as well as in determining its role in vault function through gene disruption experiments in wild-type and mvp− mutant lines. Using MvpA and MvpB cDNA probes in low stringency library screens has thus far failed to detect an MvpC clone. The available anti-vault antisera are insufficiently reactive toward MvpC to be useful in immunoscreening procedures. We are currently attempting to generate a polyclonal antibody against MvpC protein purified from M7A−B− cells. Such antibodies should enable isolation of a cDNA clone from available Dictyostelium expression libraries.

There are two major classes of stable photoproducts induced in DNA by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, namely cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs)1 1The abbreviations used are: CPDscis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers(6-4)PDspyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) dimersbpbase pairRIAradioimmunoassayNERnucleotide excision repair. and pyrimidine-pyrimidone) dimers ((6-4)PDs)(1Cadet J. Anselmino C. Douki T. Voituriez L. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1992; 15: 277-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The most prominent of these are CPDs, which are classic examples of mutagenic and carcinogenic lesions in DNA(2Harm W. Biological Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation. Cambridge University Press, London1980Google Scholar, 3Brash D.E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, even though the overall yield of CPDs is about 3-fold greater (on average) than)PDs in genomic DNA at physiologic doses of UV light, the contribution of (6-4)PDs to UV-induced mutagenesis can be significant in certain cell types(3Brash D.E.

Indeed, at the nucleosome level of chromatin, CPD formation is significantly modulated with a 10.3 base average periodicity in nucleosome cores(15Gale J.M. Nissen K.A. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6644-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 16Gale J.M. Smerdon M.J. J. Mol.

Photobiol. 1990; 51: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, whereas a similar yield of CPDs/bp is found in nucleosome core and linker DNA(17Niggli H.J. Cerutti P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Pehrson J.R. Cohen L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the yield of)PDs/bp is greater in nuclease-“sensitive” DNA than nuclease-“resistant” DNA of chromatin(13Mitchell D.L. Nguyen T.D. Cleaver J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5353-5356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Szymkowski et al.(14Szymkowski D.E. Lawrence C.W. Wood R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9823-9827Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) reported that in cell extracts, using naked DNA as a template and repair synthesis as a measure of excision repair,)PDs are repaired much more rapidly than CPDs. Thus, even in vitro (and, presumably, in the absence of nucleosomes))PDs are repaired much more rapidly than CPDs by the NER complex. This result suggests that the repair complex can locate and incise)PDs more efficiently than CPDs in naked DNA. In intact cells, this could be facilitated by the difference in nucleosome distribution within chromatin of these two photoproducts (discussed above). Indeed, rapid repair of)PDs in intact cells could (at least partially) reflect their preferential location in regions of chromatin that are more accessible to repair enzymes. Repair of)PDs in nucleosome cores, which may be less accessible to these enzymes, may occur more slowly. Such “longer lived lesions” could yield hot spots for mutagenesis. Therefore, we studied the rate of removal of both types of photoproducts at the nucleosome level of chromatin in intact human cells. Antibodies specific to each photoproduct were used to detect the induction frequency of CPDs and (6-4)PDs and used to measure their removal from nucleosome core (and chromatosome) DNA. Human diploid fibroblasts (strain AG 1518) were purchased from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% newborn calf serum, as described previously(19Smerdon M.J.

Within 24 h after passage, cells were prelabeled with 5 nCi/ml [14C]dThd (DuPont NEN) for 1 week, the labeled medium was replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were grown for an additional week to become confluent. Prior to UV damage, the cells were treated for 45 min with 2 mM hydroxyurea to arrest the low level (~0.5%) of replicating cells in these populations (e.g. see Ref. 20Sidik K. Smerdon M.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1613-1619PubMed Google Scholar). The medium was then removed, and cells were washed with warm phosphate-buffered saline (140 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM KCl, 6.8 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4) and irradiated in Petri dishes with 254-nm light in a (desktop) hood containing a single low pressure mercury lamp (Sylvania, model G 30T8), as described previously(19Smerdon M.J. Lan S.Y. Calza R.E. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13441-13447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Smerdon M.J. Tlsty T.D. Lieberman M.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2377-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Irradiation was carried out in a warm (37°C) room and the UV flux measured with a Spectroline DM-254N UV meter (Spectronics Corporation, Westbury, NY). Cells were either harvested immediately after irradiation or incubated for varying repair times (see text). After the various repair times, cells were harvested and nuclei isolated as described by Smerdon et al. (19Smerdon M.J. Lan S.Y. Calza R.E. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13441-13447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei were digested in B3 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.25 mM sucrose) with micrococcal nuclease (at 1 unit/106 nuclei) for 15 min at 37°C. The 146-bp core DNA was electrophoretically isolated as described previously(22Lan S.Y. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7771-7783Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Suquet C. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23755-23757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after digestion of nuclei with micrococcal nuclease, the mixture of oligo- and mononucleosomes was digested with proteinase K and core DNA isolated on 2.5% preparative agarose gels. The 146-bp core DNA band was excised, electroeluted into TBE (90 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 90 mM boric acid, 2.5 mM EDTA) using an electroelution device (Elutrap, Schleicher & Schuell), concentrated with isobutyl alcohol, and cleaned on a Sephadex G-50 (Sigma) spin column. Genomic DNA was prepared according to Marzluff and Huang (24Marzluff W.F. Huang R.C.C. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Transcription and Translation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1984: 89-129Google Scholar) (see also Ref. 25Bohr V.A. Okumoto D.S. Friedberg E.C. Hanawalt D.C. DNA Repair, A Laboratory Manual of Research Procedures. Vol. 3. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1988: 347-366Google Scholar). After lysis of cells and proteinase K digestion, the DNA was phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and digested with PstI. Cesium chloride gradient centrifugation for 17 h at 55,000 rpm was used to separate RNA from the DNA. The DNA fractions were pooled, dialyzed extensively, concentrated with isobutyl alcohol, and further purified on a Sephadex G-50 (Sigma) spin column. Concentrations of core and genomic DNA were obtained from absorbance scans. Details of the radioimmunoassay (RIA) have been published(26Mitchell D.L. Clarkson J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 655: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Mitchell D.L. Cleaver J.E. Epstein J.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 95: 55-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA from Clostridium perfringens (Sigma) was nick-translated with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.) to a specific activity of 5-10 × 108 cpm/μg. The labeled DNA was irradiated in water at a fluence rate of 14 watts/m2 measured at 254 nm for a total fluence of 30 kJ/m2. About 10 pg (5000-10,000 cpm) of UV-irradiated DNA competed with sample DNA for binding to antiserum. Anti-(6-4)PD or anti-CPD sera was added to 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA containing 0.15% gelatin (Type III, Sigma). The specificities of these antisera for)PDs and cis-syn cyclobutane dimers have been demonstrated previously (see Ref. 27Mitchell D.L. Cleaver J.E. Epstein J.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 95: 55-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and references therein). After overnight incubation at 4°C, goat anti-rabbit IgG (Calbiochem) and carrier γ-globulin (Calbiochem) were added and incubated for 2-3 days at 4°C to form a precipitable immune complex. The immune pellet was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in tissue solubilizer (Amersham Corp.), and assayed for radioactivity in a Packard liquid scintillation counter. Calculations of photoproduct yield were obtained from standard curves in the RIA generated from salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) irradiated with increasing fluences of 254-nm UV light. The percent inhibition of sample DNA was extrapolated through a linear regression of the standard and yields of photoproduct calculated based on induction rates of 2.45 CPD/108 daltons/J/m2/s and 0.56)PD/108 daltons/J/m2/s(8Mitchell D.L. Brash D.E. Nairn R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Human diploid fibroblasts (strain AG1518) were irradiated at various doses of UV to determine the relative yield of)PDs and CPDs within nucleosome core DNA. Nucleosome core (146 bp) and chromatosome (166 bp) DNA was isolated by preparative gel electrophoresis from nuclei digested with micrococcal nuclease. As shown previously(22Lan S.Y. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7771-7783Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), when human cell nuclei are digested in low ionic strength isotonic buffer, micrococcal nuclease liberates well defined bands of core and chromatosome DNA (Fig. 1). These bands were cut out of the gel and electroeluted, yielding only nucleosome core (or chromatosome) DNA. Samples were then subjected to RIA, using antibodies to either (6-4)PDs or CPDs. The inhibition of antibody binding to irradiated, 32P-labeled standards (see “Materials and Methods”) was determined for samples at each UV dose. The amounts of DNA required to give 50% inhibition of antibody binding, compared with the known amounts of CPDs and)PDs in the standards, were used to calculate the numbers of photoproducts/μg of core DNA. As shown in Fig. 2, the overall yield of)PDs in core DNA is about 30% that of CPDs. We chose a dose of 40 J/m2 for repair experiments to allow accurate measurement of)PDs, without any observable death of the confluent cells. The level of CPDs and)PDs remaining following different repair times (0-24 h) was then measured by performing RIAs on samples isolated following different incubation times after UV irradiation. Surprisingly, about 75% of the)PDs are removed from core DNA in only 2 h, and over 90% are removed in 24 h (Fig. 3, closed symbols). This is in marked contrast to the slow removal of CPDs over the same time period (Fig. 3, open symbols). To test if the slower rate of CPD removal is partly due to the higher yield of CPD lesions in core DNA (Fig. 2), we reduced the UV dose to 10 J/m2, where the CPD level is less than (or similar to) that of)PDs at 40 J/m2. Once again, slow removal of CPDs from core DNA was observed (Fig. 3, open triangles) and was similar to that following 40 J/m2. We also examined removal of CPDs and)PDs from chromatosome DNA (166 bp), isolated as above (see Fig. 1). Since the CPD yield is greatest near the ends of core DNA (28Jensen K.A. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4773-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and this DNA is less tightly bound to histones, we wondered if the repair kinetics would be different from repair of CPDs in core DNA of human cells. However, as with core DNA, we observed a much slower rate of removal of CPDs within chromatosome DNA and a much faster rate of removal of)PDs (data not shown). The rates of removal of each photoproduct were very similar to those observed for core DNA (Fig. 3). Finally, the ratio of each photoproduct was determined in core DNA and genomic DNA as a means of determining the relative amounts of each lesion in nucleosome core DNA and “non-core DNA” in irradiated human cells. The ratios were determined from RIA assays (i.e. 50% inhibition values) with purified genomic DNA, which was fragmented with PstI, and nucleosome core DNA isolated from the same cells. Ratios of 0.66 (for CPD) and 0.44 (for (6-4)PD) were obtained (Table I), indicating that the induction of (6-4)PDs in core DNA (relative to genomic DNA) is less than that of CPDs. This result is in general agreement with Mitchell et al.(13Mitchell D.L. Nguyen T.D. Cleaver J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5353-5356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although these authors observed a ratio for CPDs closer to 1.0.Table I:CPD and (6-4)PD Yield in Nucleosome DNA Open table in a new tab We have shown that the rates of repair of the two major (stable) UV photoproducts in DNA (CPD and)PD) are markedly different in nucleosome core (and chromatosome) regions of human chromatin. Even during the early “rapid phase” of CPD removal (reviewed in Ref. 29Smerdon M.J. Lambert M.W. Laval J. DNA Repair Mechanisms and Their Biological Implications in Mammalian Cells. Vol. 182. Plenum Press, New York1989: 271-294Crossref Google Scholar; see also Fig. 3),)PDs are removed ~10 times faster. During this time, most repair of CPDs occurs in transcriptionally active regions of chromatin (reviewed in Refs. 30Hanawalt P. Mellon I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 67-69Scopus (96) Google Scholar and 31Friedberg E.C. Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Wang Z. Dianov G. Mutat. Res. 1994; 307: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, the vast majority of)PDs is removed from genomic DNA within the time period that actively transcribed genes are repaired (i.e. <20% of genomic DNA). Our results demonstrate that this includes the highly “nuclease-protected” regions of nucleosome cores in human chromatin. These results indicate that nucleosome structure does not markedly retard repair of)PDs in intact human cells. It is possible that the repair rate of)PDs is somewhat slower in these regions (relative to nucleosome-free DNA), but it is clear that the rate is far more rapid than that of CPDs. Furthermore, the rates of removal of)PDs and CPDs we observe in confluent human fibroblasts are similar to those reported for the genome overall in human fibroblasts synchronized in S phase(32Wang Y.-C. Maher V.M. Mitchell D.L. McCormick J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4276-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). One possibility is that (6-4)PDs are recognized by a protein that does not recognize (or has a lower affinity for) CPDs that “tags” these lesions and initiates NER. Indeed, the human-damaged DNA-binding protein XPE has been observed to bind)PD with higher affinity than CPDs in synthetic DNA substrates(33Reardon J.T. Nichols A.F. Keeney S. Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. Linn S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21301-21308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a) photolyase has been observed in Drosophila(34Todo T. Takemori H. Ryo H. Ihara M. Matsunaga T. Nikaido O. Sato K. Nomura T. Nature. 1993; 361: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Thus, proteins do exist that distinguish between these UV photoproducts. The structure of)PDs in DNA may render these lesions more accessible to repair enzymes than CPDs. The adjacent pyrimidine rings in cis-syn cyclobutane dimers are predicted to be nearly coplaner(11Holbrook S.R. Pearlman D.A. Kim S.-H. Reviews of Chemical Intermediates. Vol. 10. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1988: 71-100Google Scholar), whereas the pyrimidine-pyrimidone rings in)PDs are approximately perpendicular(10Taylor J-S. Garrett D.S. Cohrs M.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7206-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This difference in local DNA structure may significantly enhance incision and removal of)PDs, compared with CPDs. It should be noted, however, that in this report we have measured repair of each photoproduct within nucleosome cores, and these regions presumably would not be isolated by our techniques if)PDs caused a major disruption of histone binding (with a concomitant increase in digestion by micrococcal nuclease). Thus, whatever the difference between)PD and CPD recognition, it occurs at photoproducts formed within folded DNA of nucleosome cores.

Differences in blood pressure under a high sodium diet in these two strains may be due to differences in the synthesis of 18-OH-11-deoxycorticosterone (18-OH DOC). This difference in 18-OH-DOC synthesis is due to mutations in the Dahl R rat's gene for P450c11β (11β-hydroxylase), an adrenal enzyme involved in the synthesis of both corticosterone and 18-OH DOC from 11-deoxycorticosterone. Aldosterone/renin ratios in plasma and in the adrenals are greater in Dahl S than R rats, suggesting an altered physiologic relationship between the renin-angiotensin and aldosterone systems between these strains. We demonstrate that the mRNA for P450c11AS, (aldosterone synthase), an enzyme required for aldosterone synthesis, is identical in the Dahl S rat and in normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats, but that P450c11AS mRNA from the Dahl R rat contains 7 mutations that result in two amino acid substitutions. These two changes result in a form of P450c11AS that has a greater apparent Vmax and lower apparent Km, resulting in an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone at a greater rate in Dahl R rats than the P450c11AS in Dahl S rats or Sprague-Dawley rats. Although plasma and adrenal renin are lower in Dahl S versus R rats, the regulation of P450c11AS mRNA expression in rats fed a low and high salt diet are identical in these strains. The current findings may explain both the reduced aldosterone concentrations and increased aldosterone/renin ratios previously reported in the Dahl S versus Dahl R rat.

The etiologies of essential hypertension are unknown, but they include both environmental and genetic factors. At least one form of salt-dependent hypertension is due to a genetic lesion in the gene for 11β-hydroxylase, P450c11β, and aldosterone synthase, P450c11AS(1Lifton R.P. Dluhy R.G. Powers M. Rich G.M.

Both the rat and human forms of this P450c11β encode a mitochondrial protein found in the adrenal fasciculata/reticularis that synthesizes corticosterone from 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC)1 1The abbreviations used are: DOC11-deoxycorticosteroneRIAradioimmunoassaySsalt-sensitiveRsalt-resistantPipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidRSVRous sarcoma virus. and cortisol from 11-deoxycortisol, while the rat and human forms of P450c11AS encode a mitochondrial protein found in the glomerulosa that synthesizes aldosterone from corticosterone(2Lauber M.

In patients with glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism, fusion of the regulatory regions of the P450c11β gene to the coding region of the P450c11AS gene results in disordered steroid synthesis, hyperaldosteronism, and hypertension(9Pascoe L.

The Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rat is the most widely studied genetic model of salt-sensitive hypertension. In the Dahl S strain, supplemental dietary sodium increases blood pressure, but in the Dahl salt-resistant (R) strain, supplemental dietary sodium has little effect on blood pressure(12Dahl L. Heine M. Tassinari L. J. Exp. Med. 1962; 115: 1173-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Molecular variants in the coding sequence of P450c11β have recently been identified that may contribute to the differences in blood pressure between the S and R strains(13Cicila G. Rapp J. Wang J.-M. Lezin St., E. Ng S. Kurtz T. Nature Genet. 1993; 3: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 14Matsukawa N. Nonaka Y. Higaki J. Nagano M. Mikami H. Ogihara T. Okamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9117-9121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The P450c11β gene of the Dahl R rat differs from that of 12 commonly used rat strains, including the Dahl S rat, and contains missense mutations that alter 11β-hydroxylase activity and decrease the production of 18-OH-DOC. Moreover, in genetic studies, these mutations have been found to cosegregate with reduced adrenal capacity to synthesize 18-OH-DOC and resistance to the hypertensinogenic effects of NaCl. These observations suggest that the robust salt resistance of the Dahl R rat relative to the Dahl S rat may be due in part to molecular variants in P450c11β and alterations in the activity of 11β-hydroxylase. However, in rats as in other mammals, the P450c11β gene is tightly linked to P450c11AS, and therefore, blood pressure effects that cosegregate with P450c11β could also be emanating from variants in P450c11AS. In the Dahl S rat, plasma levels of aldosterone are lower than in the Dahl R rat(15Rapp J.P. Dahl L.K. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Rapp J.P. Dahl L.K. Nature. 1972; 237: 338-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Rapp J.P. Dahl L.K. Endocrinology. 1973; 92: 1286-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Rapp J.P. Tan S.Y. Margolius H.S. Endocrinol. Res. Commun. 1978; 5: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and, therefore, it has been assumed that genetically determined alterations in aldosterone biosynthesis do not contribute to the strain differences in blood pressure. The lower aldosterone concentrations in Dahl S versus Dahl R rats have been proposed to be a physiologic consequence of the lower renin concentrations in Dahl S rats(19Rapp J.P. Hypertension. 1982; 4: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). However, in Dahl S rats, the ratio of aldosterone/renin in the adrenals and in the plasma is greater than in Dahl R rats(18Rapp J.P. Tan S.Y. Margolius H.S. Endocrinol. Res. Commun. 1978; 5: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Kusano E. Baba K. Rapp J. Franco-Saenz R. Mulrow P. J. Hypertens. 1986; 4: 20-22Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that in Dahl S and Dahl R rats, differences in aldosterone biosynthesis may involve something more than just differences in plasma renin activity. Although the P450c11β gene has been well characterized in Dahl S and R rats, little is known about the structure or function of P450c11AS in this model. In the current studies in Dahl S and R rats, we cloned, sequenced, and expressed P450c11AS cDNAs from these strains and studied the regulation of P450c11β and P450c11AS mRNAs. Our results suggest that strain differences in the structure and regulation of P450c11AS may be related to the strain differences in aldosterone concentrations and aldosterone/renin ratios. Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction were used to prepare and clone P450c11AS cDNAs from the adrenals of three Dahl R and three Dahl S rats. Rats were treated with furosemide (2 mg for 2 days) to induce a sodium diuresis and stimulate P450c11AS synthesis, and with dexamethasone (20 μg/animal) to suppress P450c11β mRNA synthesis(3Malee M.P. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4731-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). RNA isolated by guanidinium isothiocyanate solubilization and CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation was reverse transcribed using with the Superscript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Life Technologies Inc.). Our polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA used two sets of P450c11AS-specific primers so that the amplified products contained overlapping sequences. The first polymerase chain reaction amplified exons 1-4 and used a 5’ primer that included the first 6 amino acids of exon 1 (5’-GGATGGCAATGGCTCTCAGGGTGACA-3’) and a 3’ primer that spanned the first 6 amino acids of exon 5 (5’-CTTCCAGATACATCTGTTGG-3’). An EcoRI cloning site was added at the 5’ end of the 5’ primer. The 3’ primer has 3’-terminal mismatches for P450c11β and is specific for P450c11AS. The second polymerase chain reaction amplified exon 4-9, and used a 5’ primer specific for P450c11AS (nucleotides 651-672(21Imai M. Shimada H. Okada Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Ogishima T. Ishimura Y.

An XbaI cloning site was added to the 5’ end of the 3’ primer. Twenty nanograms of cDNA were amplified for 30 cycles using the following conditions: 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min. Amplified fragments were digested with XbaI and HindIII, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, ligated, and cloned into M13 and sequenced by dideoxy sequencing (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). All but the first 18 nucleotides of the coding sequence could be compared. Full-length P450c11AS cDNAs from both Dahl S and Dahl R rats were cloned into pECE (22Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J.

After 48 h, the cells were incubated with varying concentrations of cold corticosterone for 24 h. Enzymatic activity was assayed by determining the 0-48 h time courses for aldosterone production using 10-5M 11-deoxycorticosterone in the incubation medium or by determining aldosterone production using 10-12-10-4M 11-deoxycorticosterone in the medium for 24 h. Medium was analyzed for aldosterone by RIA (ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA).

They were divided into four groups and received one of four regimens for 7 days(3Malee M.P. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4731-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Control animals were fed rat chow and water ad libitum. Dexamethasone-treated animals received daily subcutaneous injections of 20 μg of dexamethasone in 100 μl of normal saline and were fed rat chow and water ad libitum. Sodium-restricted animals (low salt) received 2 mg of furosemide subcutaneously for 2 days and were fed sodium-deficient rat chow (background sodium, 0.0033%) (Teklad, Madison, WI) and water ad libitum. Sodium-replete animals (high salt) received 2% NaCl in their drinking water and rat chow ad libitum. After 7-days of each treatment, the rats were anesthetized with metaphane and killed by decapitation at 1300 h. Pairs of adrenals were frozen separately in liquid nitrogen. -RNA was extracted from adrenals by guanidinium isothiocyanate homogenization, purified by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation as described previously(3Malee M.P. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4731-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and quantitated by determining the optical density at 260 and 280 nm. Three different cRNA probes were prepared by transcription of various cDNA fragments cloned in pKS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to analyze the abundance of P450c11β and P450c11AS mRNAs in the adrenal. The P450c11 probe was a 280-base RNA probe containing 219-bases of rat P450c11β cDNA (corresponding to nucleotides 213-432(24Nonaka Y. Matsukawa N. Morohashi K. Omura T. Ogihara T. Teraoka H. Okamoto M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)) that hybridizes to both P450c11β and to P450c11AS mRNAs. When hybridized to normal rat P450c11β mRNA, a fragment of 219 bases is protected, and when hybridized to normal rat P450c11AS mRNA, a fragment of 192 bases is protected(3Malee M.P. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4731-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A 290-base RNA probe containing 185-bases of rat P450c11AS cDNA (corresponding to bases 809-994(5Sander M.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)). A 260-base RNA probe containing a 155-base pair rat P450c11β cDNA fragment (corresponding to bases 839-994(5Sander M.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)). To analyze P450scc mRNA, a 241-base pair EcoRI-PvuII fragment of rat P450scc cDNA(25Oonk R.B. Krasnow J.S. Beattie W.G. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21934-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mellon S.H. Kushner J.A. Vaisse C. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was cloned in pKS, generating a 296-base RNA probe that protects a 233-base RNA fragment. As a control, a 195-base rat actin RNA probe containing a 149-base pair rat β actin cDNA fragment (corresponding to nucleotides 2066-2216 of rat cytoplasmic β-actin(27Nudel U. Zakut R. Shani M. Neuman S. Levy Z. Yaffe D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar)) was synthesized by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of rat liver RNA(5Sander M. Ganten D. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). RNA probes were synthesized as described previously (28Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). RNA was analyzed by RNase protection assays (3Malee M.P. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4731-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5Sander M. Ganten D. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One microgram of RNA from the adrenal was precipitated with 500,000 cpm of 32P-labeled cRNA probe and was resuspended in 20 μl of hybridization buffer containing 80% formamide, 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM Pipes, pH 6.4, 1 mM EDTA. Samples were heated to 95°C for 5 min and incubated at 42°C overnight. Samples were then diluted 10-fold with buffer containing 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 5 mM EDTA, and 20 μg/ml RNase A. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 42°C, extracted once with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. RNase-resistant double-stranded fragments were separated on 6% polyacrylamide, 7.5 M urea/sequencing gels using 32P-labeled MspI-digested pBR322 DNA as molecular weight markers. The gels were dried onto filter paper and exposed to x-ray film under an intensifying screen at −70°C. Medium was saved from transfection assays and was analyzed for aldosterone by RIA using a commercially available kit (ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA). The sequence of the P450c11AS cDNA (from nucleotides 1 to 1547) from the Dahl S rat was identical to that of the outbred Sprague-Dawley rat and thus predicted identical amino acid sequences. However, the sequence of the P450c11AS cDNA from the Dahl R rat contained seven nucleotide differences. Five of these seven differences were silent mutations, but two changed the encoded amino acid sequence of P450c11AS (Table I): Glu 136 → Asp and Gln 251 → Arg. Both of these substitutions in the Dahl R P450c11AS sequence generate the same amino acids found at the corresponding residue of the P450c11β gene.Table I:Amino acid substitutions in P450c11AS from the Dahl resistant rat Open table in a new tab We cloned P450c11AS cDNAs from the Dahl S and Dahl R rats in the SV40 eukaryotic expression vector, pECE(22Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). These plasmids were then transfected into mouse Leydig MA-10 cells, which do not normally express P450c11AS, but which contain the mitochondrial electron transfer proteins adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase that are needed for P450c11AS activity. P450c11AS from the Dahl R and Dahl S rats synthesized aldosterone from corticosterone (Fig. 1). However, the amounts of aldosterone synthesized were radically different. The Dahl R P450c11AS synthesized >1000 times more aldosterone than did the Dahl S P450c11AS. This was not due to differences in the transfection efficiencies of the plasmids containing each cDNA, since all were co-transfected with a probe for RSV-luciferase and corrected for transfection efficiency. This difference was also not due to differential expression and stability of the different forms of P450c11AS mRNA in the transfected MA-10 cells, as RNase protection assays showed that cells transfected with both cDNA plasmids expressed P450c11AS mRNA to the same degree (not shown). These data suggest that the proteins encoded by these mRNAs are inherently different enzymatically. To characterize the enzymatic activity of each of these forms of P450c11AS, we incubated transfected MA-10 cells with varying concentrations of 11-deoxycorticosterone for various periods of time (Fig. 2). All samples were co-transfected with a vector for RSV-luciferase to correct for transfection efficiency. At all DOC concentrations and at all times, P450c11AS from Dahl R rats converted more DOC to aldosterone than did P450c11AS from Dahl S rats. Lineweaver-Burk analysis of the enzymatic conversion of DOC to aldosterone indicated an apparent Vmax of 0.0044 pg of aldosterone/ml/min for the Dahl S P450c11AS and an apparent Vmax of 4.57 pg of aldosterone/ml/min for the Dahl R P450c11AS. Similarly, Lineweaver-Burk analysis of the enzymatic conversion of DOC to aldosterone indicated an apparent Km of 19.26 μM for the Dahl S enzyme and an apparent Km of 2.15 μM for the Dahl R P450c11AS. Thus, the P450c11AS from the Dahl R rat works faster and at lower substrate concentrations than does the Dahl S P450c11AS enzyme. We used a P450c11β RNA probe that detects both P450c11β and P450c11AS mRNAs, but distinguishes them by size on polyacrylamide gels(3Malee M.P. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4731-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5Sander M. Ganten D. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The nucleotide sequences of the cloned genes and cDNAs for P450c11β (24Nonaka Y. Matsukawa N. Morohashi K. Omura T. Ogihara T. Teraoka H. Okamoto M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Mukai K. Imai M. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9130-9137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and P450c11AS (21Imai M. Shimada H. Okada Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Ogishima T. Ishimura Y. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 30Mukai K. Imai M. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9130-9137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are known. We chose a region corresponding to bases 213-432 (24Nonaka Y. Matsukawa N. Morohashi K. Omura T. Ogihara T. Teraoka H. Okamoto M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) of P450c11β for the probe (Fig. 3). The probe contains 219 bases of P450c11β sequences and 61 bases of vector sequences. Hybridization of this probe to P450c11β mRNA from either Dahl salt-sensitive or -resistant rats yields a protected fragment of 219 bases. (Mutation at base 379 in the Dahl R P450c11β mRNA from a C→U does not result in an RNase A-sensitive site.) In the region of DNA used as probe, there are eight differences between the sequence of P450c11ASsensitive and P450c11β used as probe, and six differences between the sequence of P450c11ASresistant and P450c11β used as probe (Fig. 3). However, only the differences at bases 405 and 429 (underlined in Fig. 3) result in a mismatched RNA hybrid that is sensitive to RNase A digestion(3Malee M.P. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4731-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Mellon S. Bair S. Monis H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1643-1649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus P450c11AS mRNA from both normal Sprague-Dawley and from Dahl S rats will protect a probe fragment of 192 bases (from base 213 to base 405). In the Dahl R rat, there are mutations at bases 405 and 408 that change the base to the corresponding base in P450c11β and thus do not create mismatched base pairs. However, the P450c11AS sequence in both the Dahl R and S rats differs from the sequence of P450c11β at base 429. This RNase A-sensitive mismatch results in the protection of a fragment of 216 bases. This is not seen in the Dahl S rat, since the smaller, 192 base fragment, lacking this region, is generated. Thus, our RNase protection assay can distinguish the mRNAs for P450c11AS from Dahl S and R rats. To determine if there was differential regulation of the genes encoding the P450c11β and P450c11AS mRNAs, we analyzed RNA isolated from Dahl S and Dahl R rats given different dietary and hormonal treatments. Rats were given either a high or low salt diet, which is known to alter P450c11AS mRNA abundance(3Malee M.P. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4731-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Adler G.K. Chen R. Menachery A.I. Braley L.M. Williams G.H. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2235-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Tremblay A. Parker K.L. Lehoux J.G. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3152-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), or they were given injections of dexamethasone, which is known to alter the abundance of the mRNA for P450c11β but not for P450c11AS (3Malee M.P. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4731-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both Dahl S and Dahl R rats given a normal diet produce much more P450c11β mRNA than P450c11AS mRNA (Fig. 4). This is similar to what is seen in normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats(3Malee M.P. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4731-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). When given a low salt diet, both strains of Dahl rats increase the abundance of P450c11AS mRNA without affecting expression of P450c11β mRNA. The degree to which P450c11AS mRNA is induced by a low salt diet is the same in the Dahl S and Dahl R rats and is similar to that in normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats(3Malee M.P. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4731-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As expected, there is no effect on the expression of P450c11β mRNA in either the S or R rat in rats given a high salt diet (Fig. 5). Using a greater amount of RNA (20 μg rather than 2 μg) and using a probe specific for P450c11AS mRNA (bases 809-994) (5Sander M. Ganten D. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that does not contain any differences between P450c11AS from the S and R rats, we could see that in both Dahl S and R rats given a high salt diet, there is an equivalent reduction in the abundance of P450c11AS mRNA (Fig. 5). Regulation of expression of both P450c11β and P450c11AS mRNAs by dexamethasone was also studied (Figure 5:, Figure 6:). In both the S and R rat, like in Sprague-Dawley rats, dexamethasone selectively decreases the expression of P450c11β mRNA, without affecting expression of P450c11AS mRNA. In some cases, both Dahl S and Dahl R rats are equally resistant to dexamethasone treatment, and P450c11β mRNA is unaffected (Fig. 6, Dex 3, sensitive; Dex 1, resistant). This apparent lack of regulation by dexamethasone is similar in frequency (about 1 in 3 rats) to that seen in Sprague-Dawley rats(33Mellon S. Compagnone N. Sander M. Cover C. Ganten D. Djavidani B. Steroids. 1995; 60: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).2 2C. Cover and S. Mellon, submitted for publication. This lack of P450c11β mRNA regulation was not indicative of abnormal regulation of P450c11AS mRNA in either Dahl S or Dahl R rats (Fig. 5), since P450c11AS mRNA from neither rat was affected by dexamethasone treatment. Thus, there is no difference in the regulation of P450c11β or P450c11AS mRNAs by dexamethasone between strains of Dahl rats, or between normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats and Dahl rats. It is well established that in Dahl S rats, plasma and adrenal concentrations of both renin and aldosterone are lower than in Dahl R rats(18Rapp J.P. Tan S.Y. Margolius H.S. Endocrinol. Res. Commun. 1978; 5: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Kusano E. Baba K. Rapp J. Franco-Saenz R. Mulrow P. J. Hypertens. 1986; 4: 20-22Google Scholar). This would suggest that disordered aldosterone production is not an important determinant of the greater blood pressure in S rats versus R rats. It has been proposed that the decreased concentrations of aldosterone in Dahl S rats versus R rats are a physiologic consequence of the decreased renin concentrations(19Rapp J.P. Hypertension. 1982; 4: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). However, in Dahl S rats, the aldosterone/renin ratios in the plasma and in adrenals are greater than in Dahl R rats. This raises the possibility that reduced aldosterone concentrations in Dahl S rats are not just a consequence of reduced renin concentrations. In the current study, we have found that the amount of adrenal P450c11AS mRNA is similar in S rats versus R rats and that in both strains, NaCl depletion increases P450c11AS mRNA and NaCl loading decreases P450c11AS mRNA to the same extent. Thus, the reduced plasma concentrations of aldosterone in S rats versus R rats cannot be readily attributed to physiologic reductions in P450c11AS gene expression caused by reduced plasma concentrations of renin. The finding that P450c11AS mRNA levels are similar in Dahl S and R rats despite the fact that plasma and adrenal renin levels are known to be reduced in the S strain suggests that Dahl S and R rats may differ with respect to the transcriptional regulation and or message stability of P450c11AS. Enhanced transcription or message stability of P450c11AS in Dahl S rats versus R rats could account for similar levels of P450c11AS message despite reduced renin levels in the S strain. This would serve to explain the greater aldosterone/renin ratios that have been reported in Dahl S rats versus R rats. Given that P450c11AS mRNA levels are similar in Dahl S and R rats, how does one account for the lower plasma levels of aldosterone reported in the S strain? In transfection studies, we found that the inherent enzymatic activity of aldosterone synthase is lower in the S rat versus the R rat, owing to a lower apparent Vmax and a greater apparent Km of the Dahl S enzyme. This could contribute to the lower plasma concentrations of aldosterone in S rats versus R rats in the face of equivalent amounts of P450c11AS mRNA. Reduced translational efficiency of P450c11AS mRNA from the Dahl S versus R rat could also contribute to lower aldosterone synthase activity and lower plasma levels of aldosterone in the S strain versus R strain despite equivalent amounts of P450c11AS mRNA. The transfection studies suggest that the S form of aldosterone synthase is nearly 1000-fold less active than the R form of aldosterone synthase. This 1000-fold difference in aldosterone synthase activity is far greater than the modest 2-fold differences in plasma and adrenal aldosterone levels reported between Dahl S and R rats(18Rapp J.P. Tan S.Y. Margolius H.S. Endocrinol. Res. Commun. 1978; 5: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Kusano E. Baba K. Rapp J. Franco-Saenz R. Mulrow P. J. Hypertens. 1986; 4: 20-22Google Scholar). This presumably reflects the fact that in addition to the inherent enzymatic properties of aldosterone synthase, other factors (e.g. substrate availability, translational efficiency of P450c11AS mRNA, aldosterone clearance rate, etc.) also influence circulating and tissue levels of aldosterone. The P450c11AS cDNA sequence of the Dahl S rat is identical to the P450c11AS cDNA and genomic sequence published for a Sprague-Dawley rat (21Imai M. Shimada H. Okada Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Ogishima T. Ishimura Y. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 30Mukai K. Imai M. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9130-9137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the P450c11AS sequence of the Dahl R rat differs by seven nucleotides, two of which alter the predicted protein sequence of aldosterone synthase. This is similar to what was found for the P450c11β cDNA sequence of the Dahl S and R rats, as the P450c11β cDNA sequence of the Dahl S rat was identical to that from a Sprague-Dawley rat, and the sequence from the Dahl R rat was different from both. However, in the case of P450c11AS, the nucleotide changes result in amino acid changes that substantially increase enzymatic activity, while those for P450c11β result in changes that slightly decrease enzymatic activity. The observation of specific amino acid residues associated with substantial differences in aldosterone synthase activity in Dahl S and R rats recently prompted us to investigate whether similar variations could alter the enzymatic activity of human P450c11AS. When the mutations found in the Dahl R P450c11AS were made at the corresponding residues in the human P450c11AS, they resulted in 50-80% more aldosterone production than the wild-type P450c11AS cDNA(34Fardella C.E. Rodriguez H.R. Hum D.W. Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 1040-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, identification of variants affecting aldosterone synthase activity in rats could be relevant to the molecular control of aldosterone synthase in humans. This raises the possibility that in humans, naturally occurring variation in the corresponding regions of P450c11AS might contribute to inherited variation in aldosterone production. We thank Dr. Walter L. Miller and members of his laboratory for providing the data on the activity of the human P450c11AS synthetic mutations prior to publication. We also thank Susanna Bair for performing the kinetic assays and for overall excellent technical assistance."

Like APP pre-mRNA, the primary APLP2 transcript undergoes alternative splicing, and resultant transcripts encode APLP2 isoforms containing a Kunitz protease inhibitory domain (16Petersen L.C.

In earlier efforts, we documented that in cultured cells, APLP2-751 matures through a secretory/cleavage pathway similar to that utilized by APP(15Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. von Koch C. Lo A.C.Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22099-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (CS GAG) chain is added to Ser-614 of APLP2-751(19Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22099-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence flanking Ser-614 (ENEGSGMA) is remarkably similar to a previously described recognition signal for CS GAG attachment(20Bourdon M.A. Krusius T. Campbell S. Schwartz N.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3194-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), i.e. S-G-X-G/A flanked by acidic amino acids. In the APLP2-706 and APLP2-763 isoforms, however, a 12-amino acid peptide, presumably encoded by an alternatively spliced exon, is inserted between Glu-612 and Gly-613. We have examined the metabolism of the APLP2-763 isoform, and now report that the 12 amino acid peptide abolishes CS GAG modification of the core APLP2. Thus, our data are consistent with the idea that the level of CS GAG modification of the APLP2 core protein can be modulated by insertion of sequences encoded by an alternatively spliced exon. To assess the generality of the novel mechanism of regulation of CS GAG modification in members of the APP/APLP family, we examined the levels of CS GAG modification of APP isoforms encoded by alternatively spliced APP mRNAs. Indeed, earlier reports indicated that APP is a substrate for modification by CS GAG in C6 glioma cells(21Shioi J. Anderson J.P. Ripellino J.A. Robakis N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13819-13822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shioi J. Refolo L.M. Efthimiopoulos S. Robakis N.K. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 154: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), despite our failure to demonstrate CS GAG modification of transiently expressed APP-695 or −770 isoforms in Chinese hamster ovary and COS-1 cells(19Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22099-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). L-APP isoforms, which lack 18 amino acids encoded by exon 15, contain the sequence ENEGSGL(7König G. Mönning U. Czech C. Prior R. Banati R. Schreiter-Gasser U. Bauer J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10804-10809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this sequence is generated by a fusion of sequences encoded by exons 14 and 16 and is surprisingly similar to sequences flanking the CS GAG attachment site of APLP2-751 (see above). In the present report, we demonstrate that like APLP2-751, L-APP isoforms are also substrates for CS GAG addition. The molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the levels of alternatively spliced transcripts which encode APP/APLP2 isoforms is unknown. Furthermore, the biochemical mechanism(s) by which exon 15 of APP-770/751/695 and the 12-amino acid insert in APLP2-763/706 disrupt CS GAG modification of respective core proteins have not been fully clarified. Nevertheless, we suggest that CS GAG addition represents a cell or developmental-specific mechanism to generate additional functional diversity for each polypeptide. The following oligonucleotide primers were used in this study: SD2, 5’-CCGCTCGAGGAACAGCGAGCG-3’ (encodes residues 567-570 of mouse APLP2); AsD2myc, 5’-CCGTCTAGATTAATTCAAGTCCTCTTCAGAAATGAGCTTTT GCTCCATAATCTGCATCTGCTCCAGG-3’ (complementary to sequences encoding the C-terminal 6 amino acids of APLP2 and 12 amino acids (MEQKLISEEDLN) of c-Myc); SAPP, 5’-CCGCTCGAGATCAGTTACGGA-3’ (encodes amino acids 586-589 of human APP-770); AsAPPmyc, 5’-CC-GTCTAGATTAATTCAAGTCCTCTTCAGAAATG AGCTTTTGCTCCA-TGTTCTGCATCTGCTC-3’ (complementary to sequences encoding the C-terminal 5 amino acids of APP and 12 amino acids (MEQKLISEEDLN) of c-Myc). Sequences encoding the C-terminal 196 amino acids of mouse APLP2-763 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from reverse-transcribed E16 embryonic mouse head RNA using the primer pairs SD2 and AsD2myc. The resulting PCR product was digested with XhoII and XbaI and ligated to pSVAPLP2myc(19Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22099-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), previously digested with XhoII and XbaI, to generate plasmid pSVAPLP2-763myc. The primer pair SAPP and AsAPPmyc was used in PCR to amplify cDNA fragments encoding the C terminus of APP and L-APP polypeptides using the indicated DNA as template: plasmid pEFmo695 (provided by Dr. David Borchelt, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) for the C-terminal 184 amino acids of mouse APP and reverse-transcribed mouse lung RNA for the C-terminal 166 amino acids of mouse L-APP. The PCR products were digested with XhoI and XbaI and ligated to a vector fragment generated by digesting plasmid p770SP (23Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Beyreuther K. Unterbeck A. Price D.L. Science. 1990; 248: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) with XhoI and XbaI. The resulting plasmids encode polypeptides in which the N-terminal 380 amino acids of human APP-770 are fused to the C terminus of mouse APP (770ΔmAPP) or mouse L-APP (770ΔmL-APP). COS-1 cells were transfected using a high efficiency calcium phosphate method(24Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled 36 h after transfection with 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Detergent lysates were prepared by lysing the cells in immunoprecipitation buffer(23Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Beyreuther K. Unterbeck A. Price D.L. Science. 1990; 248: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Exogenous Myc epitope-tagged APLP2 and APP polypeptides were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using polyclonal Myc-I antibody(25Lee M.K. Xu Z. Wong P.C. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Soluble APLP2 derivatives were immunoprecipitated from culture medium using polyclonal antibody D2-I raised against baculovirus-synthesized mouse APLP2-751(19Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22099-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble chimeric APP-APLP2 derivatives were immunoprecipitated from culture medium with monoclonal antibody P2-1 which recognizes an epitope in the APP ectodomain(26Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Suzuki M. Choi B.H. Farrow J.S. Geddes J.W. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. Nature. 1989; 341: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were collected with protein A-agarose (Pierce). Chondroitinase enzyme digestions of immobilized immunoprecipitates were carried out as described(19Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22099-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies, we reported that APLP2-751 is modified by the addition of CS GAG at a single serine residue (Ser-614)(19Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22099-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the APLP2-763 isoform contains an additional 12-amino acid peptide inserted two amino acids N-terminal to the CS GAG addition site. In order to assess the effect of the 12-amino acid peptide on CS GAG attachment, we transiently transfected cDNA encoding a Myc epitope-tagged mouse APLP2-763 (pSVAPLP2-763myc) into COS-1 cells in parallel with cDNA encoding Myc-tagged mouse APLP2-751 (pSVAPLP2-751). Transfected cells were biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine, and radiolabeled mouse APLP2-related molecules were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with Myc epitope-specific polyclonal antiserum Myc-I. The levels of CS GAG modification was assessed by digestion of the Myc-I immunoprecipitates with chondroitinase ABC prior to electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. APLP2-751 appears as an immature ~120-kDa polypeptide and a heterogeneous population of molecules with a mobility of ~120-200 kDa which result from the addition of variable length CS GAG to the core protein (Ref. 19Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22099-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Fig. 1B, lane 3). Chondroitinase ABC digestion of APLP2-751 resulted in the conversion of the heterogeneous set of polypeptides to a species of ~130 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 4). In contrast, APLP2-763 appears as an ~118-kDa molecule and a mature, chondroitinase ABC-insensitive polypeptide of ~130 kDa (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 5 and 6). The latter result was indistinguishable from the behavior of APLP2-751S/A, a molecule that harbors a serine-alanine substitution at Ser-614 and which fails to be modified by CS GAG(19Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22099-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, the immature form of the APLP2-763 molecule exhibits somewhat accelerated migration relative to the immature form of the shorter APLP2-751 molecule. This deviation from the expected electrophoretic mobility was also observed when newly synthesized APLP2-763 molecules were immunopreciptated from lysates of cells which were pulse-labeled for 5 min (not shown). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear but appears to be dependent of the presence of the APLP2 transmembrane and cytoplasmic segments, since the cognate secreted derivatives migrated as expected (see below, Fig. 1B, compare lanes 8 and 9). As we have demonstrated previously, cells expressing APLP2-751 secreted APLP2 derivatives of ~100-150 kDa, generated following endoproteolytic cleavage of the ~120-200-kDa cell-associated species (Fig. 1B, lane 8). On the other hand, cells expressing APLP2-763 secreted a fairly homogeneous species of ~110 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 9) which is likely generated following cleavage of the ~130-kDa cell-associated form. The cellular site and sequence requirements for the endoproteolytic cleavage of APLP2-751 and APLP2-763 remain to be determined. In any event, our studies clearly document that the 12-amino acid peptide inhibits CS GAG modification of the APLP2-763 isoform. The mechanism by which the 12-amino acid insert inhibits CS GAG modification of APLP2-763 is not fully clear. In order to assess the requirement for the presence of acidic residues upstream of the CS GAG attachment site on CS GAG addition, we examined the maturation of APLP2-751 in which glutamate residues Glu-610 and Glu-612 were substituted to glutamine. We have demonstrated that the latter molecules fail to be modified by CS GAG (data not shown), a finding that suggests that one, or both, of the acidic residues N-terminal to the Ser-Gly dipeptide is (are) essential for efficient CS GAG modification of APLP2-751. Hence, we propose that one potential mechanism by which the 12-amino acid insert inhibits CS GAG addition is by displacing the acidic residues from the CS GAG attachment site, thus altering the optimal xylosyltransferase recognition sequence(20Bourdon M.A. Krusius T. Campbell S. Schwartz N.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3194-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, several caveats to the latter interpretation remain; it is presently uncertain whether presence of the two upstream acidic residues are the sole requirement for efficient CS GAG addition of APLP2-763; confirmation awaits a systematic analysis of a spectrum of APLP2 substrates harboring additional site-directed mutations surrounding the CS GAG attachment site or by analysis of APLP2-763 with dominant mutations that restore CS GAG addition. Moreover, it is not presently clear whether the 12-amino acid peptide inhibits CS GAG addition at the level of CS GAG chain initiation or elongation. Earlier studies demonstrated that APP expressed in C6 glioma cells were modified by CS GAG(21Shioi J. Anderson J.P. Ripellino J.A. Robakis N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13819-13822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shioi J. Refolo L.M. Efthimiopoulos S. Robakis N.K. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 154: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, transiently expressed APP-695, −751, or −770 do not appear to be modified by CS GAG in human 293(27Oltersdorf T.

Science. 1990; 248: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), although heterogeneous [35S]sulfate-labeled APP-related species have been described in PC12 cells(29Weidemann A. König G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). However, little information is available about the metabolism of the L-APP isoforms that lack 18 amino acids encoded by exon 15(7König G. Mönning U. Czech C. Prior R. Banati R. Schreiter-Gasser U. Bauer J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10804-10809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, the L-APP isoforms contain a sequence ENEGSGL, generated by fusing exons 14 and 16, which is strikingly similar to the region surrounding the CS GAG attachment site of APLP2-751; remarkably, comparison of a 111-amino acid region immediately N-terminal to the transmembrane domains of APP and APLP2 reveals that the only stretch of identity resides in the ENEGSG sequence (Fig. 2). In order to assess whether L-APP is modified by CS GAG, we transfected COS-1 cells with APP minigenes that encode polypeptides in which the N-terminal 380 amino acids of human APP-770 are fused to the C-terminal 184 amino acids of mouse APP (770ΔmAPP) or 166 amino acids of mouse L-APP (770ΔmL-APP) (Fig. 3A). 770ΔmAPP is synthesized as a polypeptide of ~80 kDa (Fig. 3B, lane 1) and matures to discrete species of ~100 and ~110 kDa (Fig. 3B, lane 3). However, 770ΔmL-APP appears as an immature species of ~85 kDa (Fig. 3B, lane 2) and matures to a heterogeneous set of polypeptides of ~150-200 kDa (Fig. 3B, lane 5). As expected, mature forms of 770ΔmAPP were insensitive to chondroitinase AC digestion (Fig. 3B, lane 4). However, chondroitinase AC converted the heterogeneous ~150-200-kDa 770ΔmL-APP-related species into a homogeneous polypeptide of ~105 kDa, confirming that the chimeric L-APP forms were modified by CS GAG (Fig. 3B, lane 6). Moreover, the vast majority of soluble 770ΔmL-APP derivatives were modified by CS GAG (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 9 and 10; phosphorimaging analysis revealed that >70% of the soluble forms of 770ΔmL-APP were modified), whereas the soluble derivatives of 770ΔmAPP were insensitive to digestion by chondroitinase AC (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 7 and 8). These results demonstrate that mouse L-APP isoforms are substrates for CS GAG attachment and that insertion of sequences encoded by exon 15 into the CS GAG recognition site significantly inhibits CS GAG modification of the precursor.Figure 3:L-APP is modified by the addition of CS GAG.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2637-2644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several alternatively spliced APP and APLP2 mRNA have been described that encode a family of APP and APLP2 isoforms. We recently demonstrated that the APLP2-751 isoform is post-translationally modified by the addition of CS GAG at a single serine residue contained within the sequence ENEGSGMA(19Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22099-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To that initial observation, the present report provides two novel insights. First, we document that the APLP2-763 isoform, in which a 12-amino acid peptide is inserted two amino acids N-terminal to the CS GAG attachement site, is not modified by CS GAG. Second, we demonstrate that like APLP2-751, APP isoforms that lack sequences encoded by exon 15, termed L-APP, are also post-translationally modified by the addition of CS GAG. We suggest that L-APP are modified at Ser-638 (of L-APP 752) contained within a junctional sequence, ENEGSGLT, that is remarkably similar to sequences surrounding the CS GAG attachment site of APLP2-751. The latter result resolves the apparent discrepancy between studies which documented that APP is modified by CS GAG in C6 glioma cells (21Shioi J. Anderson J.P. Ripellino J.A. Robakis N.K. J. Biol.

Notably, our recent RT-PCR analysis of C6 glioma cell mRNA reveal that approximately 35% of APP mRNA encodes L-APP.2 2G. Thinakaran and S. Sisodia, unpublished results. These latter results are consistent with earlier studies showing that L-APP is highly expressed in microglial cells(7König G. Mönning U. Czech C. Prior R. Banati R. Schreiter-Gasser U. Bauer J.

Glia. 1993; 7: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). In any event, the sequence ENEGSG, contained within the most highly divergent domain between APP and APLP2, appears to be essential for efficient CS GAG modification of both APLP2 and APP. Moreover, CS GAG addition is effectively disrupted by insertion of sequences encoded by an alternatively spliced exon, two amino acids N-terminal to the CS GAG attachment site. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that addition of CS GAG to core proteins can be modulated by sequences encoded by alternatively spliced exons. The generality of this novel mechanism of regulation of GAG addition to other proteoglycans awaits a systematic biochemical and molecular analysis of variants of each core protein encoded by alternatively spliced transcripts. Our recent studies of the expression of APLP2 in the mouse nervous system support the view that alternatively spliced APLP2 mRNAs might encode proteins which are functionally distinct.3 3Thinakaran, G., Roskams, A. J. I., Kitt, C. A., Slunt, H. H., Masliah, E., von Koch, C., Ginsberg, S. D., Ronnett, G. V., Reed, R. R., Price, D. L., and Sisodia, S. S. (1995) J. Neurosci., in press. For example, APLP2 isoforms containing the 12-amino acid insert are expressed in mature neuronal populations in cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum (18Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14227-14234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which have established stable connections with respective targets. On the other hand, APLP2 isoforms lacking the insert are highly and selectively expressed in olfactory sensory neurons, the only neuronal population in the adult mammalian central nervous system which are continuously replaced3; axonal outgrowth from newly born sensory neurons to the olfactory bulb requires elaborate mechanisms to regulate guidance, adhesion and synaptogenesis. Thus, we argue that APLP2 isoforms which are differentially modified by CS GAG are utilized for functionally distinct aspects of neuronal biology.

https://openalex.org/W2008967473,"The amplitudes and kinetics of miniature excitatory synaptic currents (MESCs) in mammalian central neurons vary widely. It is unclear whether this variability occurs at each synapse or arises from differences among a heterogeneous population of synapses. Furthermore, it is not known how variability in these currents would affect their associated postsynaptic Ca2+ transients. To address these questions, we conducted simultaneous Ca2+ imaging and patch-clamp recordings from cultured cortical neurons and mapped individual MESCs to identified synapses displaying coincident dendritic miniature synaptic Ca2+ transients (MSCTs). Measurements of MSCTs at dendritic sites that displayed multiple events revealed that MSCT amplitude varied considerably at each site. Simultaneous measurement of MESCs and MSCTs at these sites indicated that variability in coincident synaptic currents contributes to the differences in Ca2+ transient amplitude. The ability of single synapses to exhibit variable output may enable them to engage intracellular signaling pathways at different levels of intracellular Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2006940700,"An assay employing patterned laminin substrata was used to screen for compounds that disrupt neurite guidance. One molecule, pertussis toxin, caused neurites to wander from patterns that normally guided them, yet had no significant effect on rates of neurite outgrowth. Wandering was greatest on patterns requiring frequent guidance (e.g., laminin stripes with periodic gaps). Surprisingly, the B oligomer of pertussis toxin, which lacks the subunit that inactivates G proteins, was equipotent at disrupting neurite guidance. Pertussis toxin probably acts by binding cell surface carbohydrates, since neurites lacking complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides were insensitive to the effects of the toxin. The B oligomer also blocked growth cone collapse induced by a brain membrane-derived factor; such factors are thought to act as repulsive guidance cues in vivo. That a single reagent can inhibit neuronal responses to both attractive and repulsive guidance cues suggests that such cues may share signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1990000678,"The cytokine signaling pathways that activate the Janus family of tyrosine kinases (Jaks) and the “signal transducers and activators of transcription” (Stats) have been well characterized in mammalian systems. Work shown here provides evidence that an analogous signaling pathway exists in Drosophila melanogaster. Because many of the ligand-receptor pairs in Drosophila have not been fully characterized, it was necessary to bypass the receptor stimulation event that normally triggers intracellular Jak/Stat activation. This was done by treating Drosophila Schneider 2 cells with vanadate/peroxide, which has been shown to closely mimic some signaling events triggered by interferon γ, including the activation of Jak1, Jak2, and the Stat1α protein. Evidence presented here demonstrates that vanadate/peroxide can induce a γ response region binding complex in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells. This complex contains two phosphoproteins of 100 and 150 kDa, respectively, and shares many features with the vanadate/peroxide-stimulated binding complex in the mammalian system.

Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar). The Stat family of transcription activators has several common structural features, including conserved SH2 domains. The current model of Stat activation is that a tyrosine in the carboxyl terminus of the Stat protein is phosphorylated and acts as an SH2 binding site upon cytokine stimulation(3Shuai K. Schindler C. Prezioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1808-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 4Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Tsai Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Dimerization of the Stats is necessary for DNA binding and, ultimately, induction of transcription. Activation of a transcription complex containing phosphorylated Stats can also be induced by treating cells with a combination of sodium orthovanadate and hydrogen peroxide in the absence of cytokines or growth factors(5Igarashi K.

There is growing evidence that a Jak/Stat pathway may exist in Drosophila. First, hopscotch, a Drosophila Jak kinase homologue has been cloned and characterized(6Binari R. Perrimon N. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). hopscotch is a maternal transcript, expressed in embryonic stripes. Mutations in this gene locus cause abnormalities in the expression patterns of some of the pair-rule and segment-polarity genes. This implicates the Jak kinase being involved in signal transduction pathways controlling segmentation of the developing fly. Second, a number of growth factor receptor homologs have been cloned from Drosophila. torso encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that has a cytoplasmic domain similar to that of the mammalian platelet-derived growth factor receptor and is involved in embryonic pattern formation(7Duffy J.B. Perrimon N. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 380-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Perrimon N. Cell. 1993; 74: 219-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). der, the epidermal growth factor receptor homolog, has been cloned and genetically characterized(9Raz E. Eyal S.D. Shilo B.Z. Genetics. 1991; 129: 191-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the der locus cause pleiotropic effects, implicating it in the development of a wide range of tissues(10Shilo B.Z. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2915-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Treatment of mammalian cells with either platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor has been shown to activate Jak/Stat pathways, suggesting that Torso or Der may activate a Jak/Stat pathway in Drosophila as well. Using the ligand-independent activation by vanadate/peroxide treatment, we have attempted to identify a Stat-like activity in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells. The specific GRR binding activity, which was seen after cell treatment, was dependent upon tyrosine phosphorylation. This binding complex contained phosphoproteins of 100 and 150 kDa. Detection of Stat1α-related sequences in the Drosophila genome also suggested that a Stat homolog exists in Drosophila. Schneider 2 cells (ATCC CRL 1963) were maintained in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum (Quality Biologics). Sodium orthovanadate and hydrogen peroxide were purchased from Sigma. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on the Novex system. 4G10 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. All other reagents were purchased from commercial sources unless otherwise noted. A solution of 50 mM sodium orthovanadate, 500 mM hydrogen peroxide made in Schneider medium was incubated at 24°C for 5 min. This solution was added to exponentially growing Schneider 2 cells to a final concentration of 100 μM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM hydrogen peroxide, and cells were incubated for the indicated times at 24°C. Cells were washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline. Whole cell lysates were prepared by solubilizing cells for 10 min, on ice, with intermittent vortexing, in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% Triton X-100. Particulate matter was separated from soluble material by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 5 min. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with 500 nM staurosporin or 30 μg/ml genistein for 30 min. Vanadate/peroxide solution (described above) was added to cells, and the incubation continued for an additional 60 min. 10 μg of soluble protein was diluted in binding buffer to a final concentration of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol, 0.03% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI·dC). Double-stranded probe was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase. 1 ng of probe was added to the extract. A 10- or 50-fold excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was added as indicated. For sequences of oligonucleotides used, see Fig. 2D. Binding reactions proceeded for 5 min at room temperature. Where indicated, binding reactions were preincubated for 30 min with 5 mM phenyl phosphate, 5 mM sodium phosphate, or Yersinia protein tyrosine phosphatase in the presence or absence of 1 mM sodium orthovanadate or 3 mM sodium tungstate. Binding was analyzed on a 6% non-denaturing gel containing 2.5% glycerol in 0.25 × TBE (22.5 mM Tris, 22.2 mM boric acid, 0.5 mM EDTA). Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Soluble cell lysate from activated or control Schneider 2 cells was allowed to bind to heparin-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4°C. The agarose was washed with cell lysis buffer, and the vanadate/peroxide-induced binding complex (VBC) was eluted with a salt gradient from 0 to 300 mM NaCl in cell lysis buffer. Biotinylated GRR oligonucleotide was bound to streptavidin-agarose according to standard protocols. Partially purified VBC was allowed to incubate with GRR-agarose in the presence of 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Digene Diagnostics, Inc.) for 1 h at 4°C. Affinity beads were washed 3 times with cell lysis buffer. Protein was solubilized using SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After denaturation, proteins were separated on a 4-20% acrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore) by electroblotting. Blots were subjected to standard Western blotting procedures using biotinylated 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine, streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, and ECL (Amersham Corp.) for detection. 10 μg of normal human genomic DNA, 10 μg of Drosophila genomic DNA, or 2.5 μg of Drosophila genomic DNA was digested using EcoRI. Southern blot analysis, at a stringency reduced by 14°C, was performed as described(11Kraus M.H. Aaronson S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 546-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The probe was generated by the polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers (5’-TACTGTGTTCATCATACTGTC-3’ and 5’-TGGAATGATGGATGCATCATGGGCTT-3’), spanning nucleotides 1913-2446 of human Stat1α, and labeled by nick translation. We have previously shown that vanadate/peroxide will mimic the action of interferon γ on monocytes(5Igarashi K. David M. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have also detected vanadate/peroxide stimulation of GRR-binding proteins in a number of different cell types, including HeLa, U266, THP1, U937, Daudi, and fibroblast lines.2 2A. C. Larner and D. S. Finbloom, unpublished data. Because Drosophila interferons have yet to be identified, we activated potential Stat-like proteins with vanadate/peroxide, thereby bypassing a ligand/receptor interaction. Treatment of Schneider 2 cells with vanadate/peroxide resulted in the formation of a complex that specifically bound to the GRR in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Cells required 20 min of exposure to vanadate/peroxide for assembly of the complex as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. DNA binding activity increased for up to 120 min of incubation (Fig. 1, lanes 1-8). Longer incubation times did not increase the intensity of the shift (data not shown). The intensity of the Drosophila shift was similar to the intensity of shifts detected in mammalian cells; however, the Drosophila shift complex migrated slightly faster on the native gel than did the mammalian shift complex (data not shown). The binding activity was induced in the presence of cycloheximide suggesting that new protein synthesis was not necessary for activity (data not shown). These findings suggest that the appearance of DNA binding activity is an early step in the activation of this pathway. To determine whether the induced complex bound specifically to the GRR, we performed competition experiments using specific unlabeled oligonucleotides. A 10-fold excess of either unlabeled GRR or a closely related γ-activated sequence (GAS) from the IRF1 promoter competed for labeled GRR binding (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4), while only a slight decrease in binding was observed when a 50-fold excess of a high affinity SIE (13Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) was added (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Addition of either unlabeled ISRE or AP-1 did not effect the GRR binding complex (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). A DNA binding complex was also detected when a labeled IRF1/GAS element was used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Addition of either unlabeled GRR or GAS to this binding reaction competed for the labeled GAS binding complex (Fig. 2C, lanes 2-4). These data suggest that the VBC has approximately the same affinity for the GAS and GRR sites as judged by competition analysis but has a lesser affinity for the SIE sequence. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays supported these findings where the GAS and GRR elements showed strong binding and the SIE showed slight but detectable binding (data not shown). The DNA elements that were bound by the VBC share a consensus ATTTCCCNGAAA core region that contains the GAS element described in the mammalian system (Fig. 2D)(2Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar). The ISRE and AP-1 elements, which did not compete, lack this consensus sequence. It has been clearly established that the Stat-like proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to cytokine stimulation of cells and that this phosphorylation is necessary for an active complex to be assembled(1Larner A.C. David M. Feldman G.M. Igarashi K. Hackett R.H. Webb D.A.S. Sweitzer S.M. Petricoin III, E.F. Finbloom D.S. Science. 1993; 261: 1730-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 14Gutch M.G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6593-6599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A functional SH2 domain of Stat1α and phosphorylation of tyrosine 701 are necessary for dimer formation in response to interferon γ(4Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Tsai Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides corresponding to sequences surrounding tyrosine 701 can block dimer formation. It has been speculated that this disruption is due to the SH2 domain of Stat1α binding to the phosphopeptide instead of binding to phosphotyrosine 701. Phenyl phosphate can also disrupt Stat complexes, presumably by competing for SH2 domain binding(20David M. Romero G. Zhang Z. Dixon J.E. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6593-6599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phenyl phosphate added to vanadate/peroxide-stimulated extracts of Schneider 2 cells inhibited the DNA binding activity of the VBC (Fig. 3A, lane 2), while equimolar amounts of sodium phosphate or a 10-fold higher concentration of sodium chloride had no effect on the DNA binding activity (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). The inhibition of DNA binding activity by phenyl phosphate can be reversed by removing the salt by dialysis (data not shown). These results are consistent with the Drosophila vanadate/peroxide-inducible complex containing a protein with an SH2 domain. Other assays have been used in the mammalian system to confirm that Stat-like proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated and that this phosphorylation is important for maintaining a DNA binding activity(1Larner A.C. David M. Feldman G.M. Igarashi K. Hackett R.H. Webb D.A.S. Sweitzer S.M. Petricoin III, E.F. Finbloom D.S. Science. 1993; 261: 1730-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 20David M.

Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These assays have included the treatment of activated extracts with the tyrosine-specific phosphatase, YOP51, and pretreatment of cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, staurosporin(21Fu X.Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Treatment of a Schneider 2 cell lysate from vanadate/peroxide-treated cells with the tyrosine-specific phosphatase, YOP51, disrupted the DNA binding activity (Fig. 3B, lane 2). This inhibition was reversed by the addition of either 1 mM sodium vanadate or 3 mM sodium tungstate, which are inhibitors of tyrosine-specific phosphatases. The VBC was also inhibited by pretreatment of the Schneider 2 cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein or staurosporin (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 3). These data suggest that a tyrosine kinase is involved in the formation of the Drosophila DNA binding complex and that tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for DNA binding activity. VBC was partially purified as described under “Materials and Methods” and adsorbed to a GRR oligonucleotide affinity resin. The loss of the VBC activity from the extract was monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. The DNA binding complex, which specifically adsorbed to the GRR column, was analyzed by Western blotting with 4G10, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes phosphotyrosine. Two inducibly phosphorylated proteins of approximate molecular mass of 100 and 150 kDa were detected (Fig. 4). Either of these sizes would be appropriate for a Drosophila Stat since the mammalian Stat proteins range in molecular mass from 84 kDa (Stat 4) to 113 kDa (Stat 2)(22Yamamoto K. Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B.L. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4342-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 23Fu X-Y. Kessler D.S. Veals S.A. Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8555-8559Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Two minor bands of 120 and 130 kDa were not consistently detected and could be due to degradation of pp150. Based upon functional evidence presented here, we sought to determine whether the Drosophila genome harbors DNA sequences related to human Stat1α. Ten μg of normal human and Drosophila genomic DNA were digested with EcoRI, and the products were separated on agarose gels. To correct for differences in genomic complexity of both species, 2.5 μg of Drosophila genomic DNA were also analyzed. Southern blot analysis was performed using the SH2 domain coding sequence of human Stat1α as a probe. As shown in Fig. 5, three major bands of 3, 4.4, and 10 kilobases, respectively, were observed in Drosophila DNA in addition to several minor bands. The strongly hybridizing fragments were also detectable in 2.5 μg of Drosophila genomic DNA ensuring specificity of hybridization. These findings suggest that the Drosophila genome contains at least one and perhaps three genes related to the mammalian Stat1α SH2 domain. In summary, we have identified a unique DNA binding activity in Drosophila melanogaster. This activity resembles the Stat-like activity that has been extensively characterized in the mammalian system. In both the mammalian and the Drosophila systems, vanadate/hydrogen peroxide treatment of cultured cells induces a specific GRR binding complex whose formation is dependent upon tyrosine phosphorylation. Detection of Stat1α-related sequences in the Drosophila genome raises the possibility that, as in the mammalian system, Stat1α-like proteins are responsible for this activity. Work is in progress to obtain the protein sequence and to clone the cDNA encoding such novel Stat proteins. Work presented here is important to the understanding of the mammalian Jak/Stat signaling pathways. Drosophila can provide a genetic model of Jak/Stat activation and give insight into the significance of conserved protein sequences. This work is also important for Drosophila development because, like the Drosophila Jak protein, the Stat-like protein may play a role in signal transduction during stripe formation."

Viral coat protein molecules in their mature conformations interact intimately, forming a shell that encloses the viral nucleic acid.

Lenk E.V. Botstein D. J. Mol Biol. 1973; 80: 697-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar; 30King J. Casjens S. Nature. 1974; 25l: ll2-ll9Google Scholar; 15Fuller M.T. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 633-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). P22 structural proteins are not proteolytically processed during the assembly process, which facilitates their study (40Prevelige P. Thomas D. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 743-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, assembly-competent phage P22 coat protein subunits can be obtained in vitro, which permits comparison of the properties of polymerized and unpolymerized protein (14Fuller M.T. King J. Virol. 1981; 112: 529-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 1982). The formation of procapsids containing coat protein, scaffolding protein, and one minor protein has been reproduced in vitro from purified proteins (40Prevelige P. Thomas D. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 743-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar; 56Thomas D. Prevelige P. Virology. 1991; 182: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The rate of procapsid formation in vitro showed a fifth order dependence on the concentration of coat protein, which suggested that a coat protein pentamer forms a rate-limiting initiation complex (39Prasad B.V.V. Prevelige P.E. Marietta E. Chen R.O. Thomas D. King J. Chui W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The P22 coat protein has been reported to be monomeric in purified form at concentrations lower than 1.3 mg/ml (40Prevelige P. Thomas D. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 743-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Studies by x-ray scattering and more recently by cryo-electron microscopy have demonstrated that the P22 procapsid is smaller and rounder than the virion particle (10Earnshaw W. Casjens S. Harrison S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 387-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar; 39Prasad B.V.V. Prevelige P.E. Marietta E. Chen R.O. Thomas D. King J. Chui W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The coat protein is arranged in an icosahedral T = 7 lattice of pentamers and hexamers on the procapsid shell and in the mature phage. This suggests that the coat protein can exist in 14 different conformations while on the shell (5Caspar D.L.D. Klug A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1962; 27: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar; 39Prasad B.V.V. Prevelige P.E. Marietta E. Chen R.O. Thomas D. King J. Chui W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Holes present at the center of procapsid hexamers and pentamers are thought to represent the exit port of the scaffolding protein (24Greene B. King J. Virology. 1994; 205: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Rearrangement of coat protein mass seals these holes in the phage (39Prasad B.V.V. Prevelige P.E. Marietta E. Chen R.O. Thomas D. King J. Chui W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For many oligomeric proteins, chain folding is linked to subunit assembly, which occurs from partially folded intermediates (29Jaenicke R. Prog. Biophys. Molec. Biol. 1987; 49: 117-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether virus capsids assemble from partially folded molecules that complete folding during the assembly process, or fold into their lattice conformations in solution prior to subunit association. The coat protein can be refolded in vitro from the fully denatured state, and the resultant subunits are monomeric and competent for assembly in vitro (54Teschke C.M. King J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10839-10847Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As a means of investigating the coat protein folding and assembly process, we studied a set of 18 coat protein temperature-sensitive mutants in vivo (21Gordon C.L. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9358-9368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These missense mutations, resulting in single amino acid substitutions, were distributed throughout the gene and had in vivo restrictive growth temperatures ranging from about 33°C to 41°C (22Gordon C.L. King J. Genetics. 1994; 136: 427-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; 23Gordon C.L. Sather S. Casjens S. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the mutants had similar phenotypes. Virion particles formed at low temperature were stable at restrictive temperature. When cells were infected at restrictive temperature, the mutant coat protein was recovered in inclusion body aggregates. The formation of irreversible aggregates generally reflects poor stability of folding intermediates rather than of the native folded molecule (35London J. Skrzynia C. Goldberg M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar; 37Mitraki A. King J. Bio/Technology. 1989; 7: 690-697Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar; 18Goldberg M.E. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). These results, as well as additional genetic studies (22Gordon C.L. King J. Genetics. 1994; 136: 427-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggested that the mutants were defective in folding. The temperature-sensitive folding phenotype of these mutants was corrected by increasing the levels of GroEL/S, which transiently interacted with newly synthesized coat protein (22Gordon C.L. King J. Genetics. 1994; 136: 427-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggested that thermolabile intermediates were physiological substrates for GroEL/S in vivo. The T4 major coat protein also requires GroEL function, and in fact the phage T4 encodes a specific homolog of GroES (58van der Vies S.M. Gatenby A.A. Georgopoulos C. Nature. 1994; 368: 654-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The stabilities of P22 coat subunits and the procapsid shell have also been studied using hydrostatic pressure (42Prevelige Jr., P.E. King J. Silva J.L. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1631-1641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Two single-site substitutions, including W48Q, had marked effects on the stability of the assembled shell (13Foguel D. Teschke C.M. Prevelige Jr., P.E. Silva J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1120-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we report characterization of purified protein subunits from wild-type and four of the tsf1 1The abbreviations used are: tsftemperature-sensitive foldingCDcircular dichroismDSCdifferential scanning calorimetryDTTdithiothreitolGPCgel permeation chromatographyGdmClguanidinium chlorideΔHcalorimetric enthalpyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTtemperature of the maximum heat capacityVelution volume. mutants (W48Q, A108V, T294I, and F353L) in vitro, using DSC, column chromatography, and spectroscopic techniques. We anticipated that study of mutants from different regions of the coat protein could define the importance of specific coat domains, and that in vitro studies of mutants with different in vivo restrictive growth temperatures would address the link between in vitro stability and in vivo folding. In addition, two of the four mutations involved aromatic residues, which are generally highly conserved. The results presented in this report, in conjunction with previous studies, point to the importance of elucidating the interplay between chain folding, subunit stability, and subunit assembly. temperature-sensitive folding circular dichroism differential scanning calorimetry dithiothreitol gel permeation chromatography guanidinium chloride calorimetric enthalpy polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis temperature of the maximum heat capacity elution volume. All chemicals used were reagent grade. All bacterial strains were derivatives of Salmonella typhimurium LT2. The suppressor minus host DB7136 and its suppressor plus derivative DB7155 have been described by 59Winston F.D. Botstein D. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 433-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Procapsids from cells infected with phage carrying the wild-type gene 5 and from cells infected with phage carrying the tsf alleles W48Q, A108V, T294I, and F353L were purified essentially as described by 16Galisteo M.L. King J. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 227-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar. Infections were carried out at 26.5°C, which is a permissive temperature for the tsf mutants. Host DB7136 cells were infected with phage strains carrying the coat protein allele of interest, as well as gene 3 amber and gene 13 amber alleles, which block the phage assembly process at the procapsid stage (31King J. Lenk E.V. Botstein D. J. Mol Biol. 1973; 80: 697-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Empty procapsids were purified from procapsids as described by 16Galisteo M.L. King J. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 227-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, with minor modifications. Procapsids in the presence of 0.5 M GdmCl were run through a Bio-Gel A-0.5m column, then concentrated by centrifugation. This treatment was repeated three times, in order to completely eliminate the scaffolding and the minor proteins. Concentrated stocks of purified empty procapsids, which contained exclusively coat protein, were treated with GdmCl at a final concentration of 4.6 M overnight at room temperature. This procedure dissociates the shells, liberating free denatured coat protein molecules. These were extensively dialyzed in experimental buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate, 25 mM NaCl, pH 7.6). Protein concentration was determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 1.04 for the wild-type, A108V, T294I, and F353L subunits. An extinction coefficient of 0.907, calculated following 11Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar, was used for W48Q, which lacks one tryptophan. The protein solutions were always maintained at temperatures between 4 and 10°C after dialysis, and all experiments were carried out with dialyzed protein samples that were not older than 4 days. Dialyzed samples were used for DSC and some of the circular dichroism (CD) experiments without dilution. They were diluted 10-fold with experimental buffer for fluorimetry, and for the CD studies in which a 1-cm cuvette was used. A KNK-500-A series liquid chromatograph (Konik Instruments) was used. About 10-20 μl of protein samples previously dialyzed in experimental buffer, and within the range 0.5-0.7 mg/ml, were injected into a Spherogel TSK-3000PWHR column (Beckman) equilibrated at several temperatures. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Absorbance at 280 nm was registered continuously with an ERC-7211 UV detector (ERMA Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Data were recorded in a graphic register and then digitized with a Gentizier tablet model GT-1812D (Autocad, Autodesk). Overlapping peaks were deconvoluted into two Lorentzian curves, and their elution volumes and areas were determined, using the program PEAKS from Dr. E. Freire (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). For the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) experiments with F353L in which subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE was performed, 90 μl of sample were injected into the column. Four-drop fractions were collected at the outlet and mixed with SDS-sample buffer lacking β-mercaptoethanol. In order to determine the apparent molecular weight of the species detected by GPC, the column was calibrated with molecular weight markers within the range 29,000-100,000. The excluded volume was calibrated with blue dextran. DSC of protein samples was carried out as described by 16Galisteo M.L. King J. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 227-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar. A DASM-4 microcalorimeter (Mashpriborintorg, Moscow region, Russia) was used. Protein concentrations were within the range 0.3-1.2 mg/ml. Second scans of previously heated samples gave no thermal effects. All samples were heated to 100°C; in the wild-type sample alone, an additional small thermal effect was observed at about 85°C (due to the existence of coat protein shells formed during the renaturation process at low yield, which denature at that temperature). Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer, and the temperature was controlled with a circulating water bath. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm. Emission spectra were taken from 300 to 450 nm, at 240 nm/min, with an excitation slit of 2.5 nm and an emission slit of 5 nm. Far UV-CD spectroscopy was used to monitor the secondary structure of the wild-type and mutant proteins. An Aviv 60DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ) with a temperature control accessory (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) was used. Spectra were recorded in 1-mm or 1-cm cells at protein concentrations of approximately 0.6 or 0.06 mg/ml, respectively. CD spectra were recorded from 190 to 350 nm, each nm, with an averaging time of 1.5 s. For both fluorescence and CD, samples were incubated for at least 10 min at 10°C before the spectra were taken. Within infected cells at permissive temperature, both wild-type and tsf mutant polypeptide chains fold into assembly-competent species, which interact with scaffolding subunits and minor proteins to form procapsids. Procapsid particles, assembled at permissive temperature, either from wild-type coat protein or one of the four tsf mutants (W48Q, A108V, T294I, and F353L), were purified from appropriately infected host cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After extraction of scaffolding and minor proteins, empty procap-sid shells containing only coat protein were purified and then dissociated in 4.6 M GdmCl, yielding denatured chains (54Teschke C.M. King J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10839-10847Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The denatured chains were extensively dialyzed at 4°C against experimental buffer. In the absence of scaffolding protein and at the relatively low protein concentrations used, we anticipated that the resulting renatured coat protein subunits would form low levels of coat shells and large aggregates (40Prevelige P. Thomas D. King J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 743-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the excess heat capacity versus temperature profiles for the soluble subunits, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The DSC transition corresponding to the thermal denaturation of wild-type coat protein was irreversible and scan rate-dependent. The Tm was 40.0°C at 2.0 K/min, and 38.0°C at 0.5 K/min. The whole transition, not just the Tm, was shifted to lower temperature at the lower scan rate (not shown). This suggests that the DSC transition was completely determined by the kinetics of the irreversible step(s). The subunits denatured rapidly at physiological temperatures (Fig. 3). The half-time of denaturation was ~10 min at 38°C. Electron microscopy performed on heated samples, which had become visibly turbid, demonstrated that the denatured protein had aggregated (not shown).Figure 3:Wild-type P22 coat protein irreversible denaturation is kinetically controlled. Aliquots (1 ml) of wild-type protein solution at 0.61 mg/ml were placed in a water bath at 38°C for the indicated times (in minutes). After those times the samples were cooled to 4°C and subjected to DSC at 2.0 K/min. The bar corresponds to 20 kJ/K·mol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The denaturation enthalpy of wild-type coat protein was ~600 kJ/mol at 40.0°C, the specific enthalpy of denaturation being 2.8 cal/g. This value is within the range found for typical compact globular proteins that denature in this temperature range (43Privalov P.L. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar) but is toward the low end of this range, which is consistent with the protein not being highly compact. If the mechanism of in vivo temperature sensitivity were destabilization of folded subunits, the tsf mutants would be expected to have significantly lower melting temperatures than the wild-type protein. The tsf mutant proteins were subjected to DSC in the same experimental conditions of protein concentration and buffer as the wild-type protein. Thermal denaturation was irreversible, and heated samples were visibly turbid. The tsf mutant protein subunits have melting temperatures very close to the wild-type (; Fig. 2), with three of the four mutants having higher melting temperatures. A108V had a melting point 3°C lower than wild-type protein. These data indicate that the in vivo mechanism of temperature sensitivity is not destabilization of folded subunits. The enthalpies of denaturation found for the tsf mutants were about half of the wild-type value (Table I). This is consistent with fewer intramolecular interactions in the folded state.Table I:Transition midpoints (Tm) and denaturation enthalpy values (ΔH) for the thermal denaturation of the P22 coat wild-type and tsf mutant proteins obtained by DSCScan rate was 2.0 K/min. Tm values are in°C and ΔH values in kJ/mol. Protein concentration was within the range 0.6-1.2 mg/ml. Parameters were obtained from at least three independent experiments. The standard deviations of the measurements are also shown. Open table in a new tab Scan rate was 2.0 K/min. Tm values are in°C and ΔH values in kJ/mol. Protein concentration was within the range 0.6-1.2 mg/ml. Parameters were obtained from at least three independent experiments. The standard deviations of the measurements are also shown. The secondary structures of purified wild-type and mutant proteins were compared using circular dichroism spectroscopy at 10°C (Fig. 4). The wild-type protein has a CD spectrum typical of a protein that contains both α-helix and β-sheet, with minima at 221 and 209 nm (Table II). The four mutant proteins share similar CD spectra: a decreased signal at 221 nm and a shift of the second minimum to 203 nm, both of which are indicative of a lower content of ordered structure in these samples (25Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar).Table II:Spectroscopic parameters of the wild-type and tsf mutants in 20 mM phosphate, 25 mM NaCl, pH 7.6Temperature was 10°C. λmax (nm) corresponds to the minimum intensities in the far-UV CD spectra for the wild-type and tsf mutant coat proteins. λmax (nm) corresponds to the maximum intensity in the emission fluorescence spectra for the indicated proteins. Open table in a new tab Temperature was 10°C. λmax (nm) corresponds to the minimum intensities in the far-UV CD spectra for the wild-type and tsf mutant coat proteins. λmax (nm) corresponds to the maximum intensity in the emission fluorescence spectra for the indicated proteins. Fluorescence of wild-type and mutant proteins was carried out at 10°C (Fig. 5). Wild-type and three of the mutant proteins have 6 tryptophanyl residues; the mutant W48Q has 5. They are distributed throughout the amino acid sequence, so the fluorescence emission spectrum yields information pertaining to the average environment of these tryptophanyl residues. The wild-type spectrum has its maximum emission intensity at 340 nm, indicating partial exposure of tryptophanyl residues to the solvent in the native protein (32Lacowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). The maximum emission wavelength is red-shifted for the mutants with respect to wild-type (Table II), indicating increased overall exposure of tryptophanyl residues to solvent in these proteins (32Lacowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). The intensity of the emission maximum was larger for the mutants than the wild-type protein. Wild-type and tsf mutant proteins, denatured in 4.6 M GdmCl, had spectra with maxima at 352 nm and fluorescence intensities 3-4 times lower than in the absence of GdmCl (not shown). A similar result for the wild-type protein in Tris buffer has been reported (54Teschke C.M. King J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10839-10847Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The red-shifted spectrum seen for the mutant subunits was consistent with these subunits adopting a less ordered structure. Since the unfolded wild-type protein gives a reduction in fluorescence intensity, the increase in intensity seen for the folded tsf mutant subunits was surprising. The mutants may specifically expose some tryptophanyl residue(s) to solvent that were quenched by nearby amino acids in the wild-type. Alternatively, the mutants could bury some specific tryptophanyl residue(s), quenched by solvent or nearby amino acids in the wild-type protein, while still giving an average overall increase in exposure of tryptophanyl residues to solvent. The altered association properties described below can account for such results. Since mutant fluorescence intensities were not just intermediate between folded and unfolded protein, differences in properties between the mutant and wild-type protein cannot be simply due to a reduced yield of refolded mutant subunits. GPC was utilized to examine the conformational state of the proteins and to determine whether or not the samples were heterogeneous. Fig. 6 shows the GPC results for the wild-type protein and the tsf mutant proteins at 14°C. The prominent peak observed in the wild-type sample eluted at the apparent molecular weight expected for a globular monomer (Ve= 6.72 ± 0.02 ml). A small peak in the void volume, due to the presence of coat protein shells formed during the renaturation process, was also observed. The nature of the small peak at Ve = 8.1 ml is at present unclear. The mutant protein profiles contained, in addition to the monomer peak, a second larger peak with an elution volume very near that expected for a dimer (Ve = 5.98 ± 0.03 ml). The wild-type sample had a small peak at this position. Small peaks representing higher multimers were also present, especially in A108V. The A108V multimers eluted with a Ve = 5.33 ± 0.02 ml, slightly slower than blue dextran. The apparent molecular weights of the two major peaks detected by GPC with the mutant protein samples were calculated based on the elution volumes of protein standards. The values obtained (approximately 44,000 and 92,000) are near those predicted from the sequence for a coat monomer (47, 0) and dimer(94, 0), respectively. GPC at several temperatures was performed to determine if the two species were in equilibrium with each other. As the temperature was increased from 6 to 28°C (Fig. 7), the mutant dimer peak decreased in intensity and the monomer peak increased correspondingly. The monomer and dimer peaks could be resolved from each other, and the relative peak intensities were temperature-dependent, indicating that these two species were undergoing slow equilibration. In the GPC profile of the wild-type protein at 14°C, a small peak with the molecular weight of a dimer was present (Fig. 6). However, this species was not in equilibrium with monomers, since its population did not vary with temperature (not shown). P22 coat protein has one cysteine residue per molecule (Cys-405), so we considered the possibility that the wild-type dimeric species was disulfide-linked. SDS-PAGE of the wild-type and mutant samples was performed in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol. Fig. 8 shows that, in all cases, a small population of disulfide-linked dimers exists. The disulfide-linked dimers eluted from the GPC column with the non-covalent dimers (Fig. 9), which confirmed our identification of the dimer peak. Disulfide-linked coat protein molecules were not present in the originally purified coat protein shells (not shown). This was expected, since the bacterial cytoplasm in which the coat protein molecules fold and assemble is a reducing environment. Renaturation of F353L in the presence of DTT yielded exclusively non-covalent dimers (Fig. 9).Figure 9:Non-covalent dimers still form in a reducing environment. F353L was first renatured and then chromotographed at 14°C. Both processes were either in the presence (top) or absence (bottom) of 10 mM DTT. Protein was at 0.75 mg/ml in the presence of DTT and 0.61 mg/ml in the absence of DTT."

We have also reported that the growth rate regulation of some but not all tRNA species is dependent on the activity of the factor for inversion stimulation (FIS). In present work, we studied the growth rate regulation of the serine- and threonine-accepting tRNA families. We show that the levels of tRNA3Thr, tRNA3Ser, tRNA2Thr, tRNA3Thr, and tRNA4Thr are reduced in fis cells as the growth rate increases. The accumulation of these tRNA species is reduced 2-5-fold at the fastest bacterial growth rate. The strongest effect is observed for the two minor tRNA species; tRNA2Ser and tRNA2Thr. In contrast, we find that the accumulation of tRNA1Ser, tRNA5Ser, and tRNA1Thr is similar in wild type and fis bacteria. The data presented provide further evidence for the suggestion that FIS is a stimulating factor that is involved, directly or indirectly, in the high expression level of some tRNA genes at fast bacterial growth rates.

The tRNA multigene family of Escherichia coli consists of 79 genes that are distributed in 41 transcription units, encoding 46 structurally distinct tRNA species (41 different anticodons)(1Komine Y. Adachi T. Inokuchi H. Ozeki H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 96: 69-86Google Scholar). Some tRNA genes are located in the spacer regions within the seven rRNA operons. Others are located in operons coding only for tRNA or are cotranscribed with protein coding sequences. The large number and disparate structure of tRNA operons make the study of tRNA gene expression complicated. In addition to the growth rate control, two mechanisms that actively regulate the accumulation of stable RNA, tRNA and rRNA, have been described: the ppGpp1 1The abbreviations used are: ppGpp5’,3’-diphosphate guanosineFISfactor if inversion stimulation. -dependent stringent control and the more recently described factor for inversion stimulation (FIS)-dependent activation (for reviews see Refs. 2Cashel M.

The involvement of ppGpp in repressing the synthesis of stable RNA in response to amino acid or energy source starvation is well documented (2Cashel M. Rudd K.E. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington D.C.1987: 1410-1438Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that ppGpp is involved in the growth rate regulation of stable RNA synthesis since the level of ppGpp is inversely correlated with the expression level of stable RNA at different growth rates(4Ryals J. Little R. Bremer H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1261-1268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, bacteria that are deficient in degrading ppGpp grow at slower growth rates and have reduced rRNA transcription rates compared with wild type bacteria(5Sarubbi E. Rudd K.E. Cashel M.

However, deletion of the genes that encode the two ppGpp synthetases results in a bacterium (relA, spoT) that, albeit with a slower growth rate, regulates stable RNA synthesis in a normal growth rate-dependent manner(7Gaal T.

This suggests either that ppGpp is not involved in the growth rate control or alternatively that some other regulatory mechanisms take over in the absence of ppGpp. One such mode of regulation has been described as ribosomal feedback inhibition (8Jinks-Robertson S. Gourse R.L. Nomura M. Cell. 1983; 33: 865-876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This phenomenon was observed in cells that overproduced rRNA from plasmids(8Jinks-Robertson S. Gourse R.L. Nomura M. Cell. 1983; 33: 865-876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 9Gourse R.L. Nomura M. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of plasmid-borne rRNA genes resulted in reduced expression of the chromosomal rRNA and tRNA genes. The ribosomal feedback inhibition mechanism depends on the formation of functionally initiated ribosomes(10Cole J.R. Olsson C.L. Hershey J.W.B. Grunberg-Manago M. Nomura M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but the details of this mechanism are not known. Some stable RNA operons have been shown to be activated by FIS, in vitro or in vivo(11Nilsson L. Vanet A. Vijgenboom E. Bosch L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 12Ross W. Thompson J.F. Newlands J.T. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 13Condon C. Philips J. Fu Z.-Y. Squires C. Squires C.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4175-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). FIS-dependent activation is regulated by de novo synthesis of FIS protein, where the fis gene is both auto-regulated and subject to stringent control(14Ninnemann O. Koch C. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bact. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon dilution of stationary phase cultures in fresh medium or after a nutritional up-shift, the level of the FIS protein increases rapidly and reaches a peak after approximately one generation(15Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bact. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nilsson L. Verbeek H. Vijgenboom E. van Drunen C. Vanet A. Bosch L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data suggest that FIS is involved in accelerating bacterial growth rate under those conditions. In order to understand how the composition of the tRNA pools is regulated in E. coli, we have determined the growth rate-dependent level of individual tRNA species in strains where the fis gene is deleted. We have previously studied the tRNA species belonging to the arginine, leucine, and methionine isoacceptor families(17Nilsson L. Emilsson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have studied the growth rate regulation of the serine and threonine-accepting tRNA species in E. coli strain W1485 and in a isogenic fis bacteria. Five tRNA species show a strong dependence on a functional FIS protein for their accumulation. Here, the levels of tRNA are reduced as much as 5-fold in fis bacteria. Expression of the other three tRNA species are identical in wild type and fis bacteria. These data provide support for the suggestion that the FIS protein is involved in the high expression level of many tRNA genes at fast bacterial growth rates. [γ-32P]ATP, polynucleotide kinase, and the Hybond-N+ membranes were purchased from Amersham International (UK). Formamide, phenol, and the components used for the electrophoresis were of ultrapure grade and purchased from International Biotechnologies Inc. The bacterial strains used for RNA determinations were E. coli W1485 (18Guyer M.S. Reed R.R. Seitz J.A. Low K.B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Qant. Biol. 1981; 45: 135-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and W1485-fis767 (fis cells)(17Nilsson L. Emilsson V. J. Biol.

A. 1988; 85: 3484-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in M9 medium(20Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar), supplemented with vitamin B1 (0.01 mM), FeCl3 (0.03 mM), CaCl2 (0.1 mM), MgSO4 (1 mM), and 0.4% of acetate, succinate, or glucose as the carbon source. In addition, cultures were grown in rich medium containing 20 amino acids, purines, and pyrimidines as described by Neidhardt et al. (21Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and LB medium containing 0.4% glucose (20Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37°C with vigorous shaking in a water bath. The cultures were grown in a steady state phase for at least 10 generations as described by Emilsson and Kurland (22Emilsson V. Kurland C.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4359-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and were harvested on ice at an A450 of 0.8. The cells were lysed, and the RNA was extracted as described by Emilsson and Kurland(22Emilsson V. Kurland C.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4359-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Approximately 25 μg of the crude RNA extract was fractionated on horizontal 1.2% agarose gels in TAE buffer (40 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.5, and 1 mM EDTA) and then transferred to Amersham Hybond-N+ hybridization filters. The filters were hybridized with specific probes for 16 S rRNA and one tRNA species as described previously(17Nilsson L. Emilsson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Emilsson V. Kurland C.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4359-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The labeled bands were identified by autoradiography, excised, and measured in a liquid scintillation counter for radioactive quantitation. The films were also analyzed by densitometric scanning counter. The tRNA-specific oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes were complementary to the 3’-half of the molecules, i.e. the variable loop, anticodon stem, and anticodon loop sequences of the tRNAs studied (5’ to 3’): Ser1: AACCCTTTCGGGTCGCCGGTTTTC; Ser2: GTAGAGTTGCCCCTACTCCGGT; Ser3: CCCCGGATGCAGCTTTTGACC; Ser5: ATACGTTGCCGTATACACAC; Thr1: CTGGGGACCCCACCCCT; Thr2: CCTACGACCTTCGCATT; Thr3: CTGCCGACCTCACCCTT; Thr4: CTGGTGACCTACTGATT. The 16 S rRNA-specific oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe is an 18-mer complementary to the conserved region between positions 562 and 579(23Noller H.F. Woese C.R. Science. 1981; 212: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Inactivating the fis gene does not change the growth rate-dependent expression of the rRNA operons(12Ross W. Thompson J.F. Newlands J.T. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 17Nilsson L. Emilsson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have therefore used 16 S rRNA as an internal standard and expressed our data as the ratio of tRNA to 16 S rRNA. The target specificity of the eight oligonucleotides used has been tested, showing that the probes are tRNA-specific.2 2V. Emilsson and L. Nilsson, unpublished data. In this study, we find two modes of tRNA regulation. Some tRNA species such as tRNA2Ser have reduced expression in fis cells, whereas others like tRNA5Ser are unaffected. Four tRNA species belong to the serine-accepting tRNA family in E. coli, tRNA1Ser, tRNA2Ser, tRNA3Ser, and tRNA5Ser. According to predictions based on the unmodified anticodon, tRNA1Ser translates the minor UC(A/G) codons. Transfer RNA5Ser translates the two major serine codons UC(U/C), while the two rare serine-accepting tRNAs, tRNA2Ser and tRNA3Ser, translate the minor serine codons UCG and AG(U/C), respectively. Accumulation of tRNA1Ser, encoded by a single gene in the serT operon(1Komine Y. Adachi T. Inokuchi H. Ozeki H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 96: 69-86Google Scholar), is moderately decoupled from the accumulation of 16 S rRNA in both wild type and fis bacteria (Fig. 2), while the accumulation of the rare tRNA2Ser, encoded for by the serU operon(1Komine Y. Adachi T. Inokuchi H. Ozeki H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 96: 69-86Google Scholar), is severely reduced in the absence of FIS (, Fig. 1, and Fig. 2). Here, tRNA2Ser accumulation is coupled to the production of 16 S rRNA in wild type cells at various growth rates, while in fis cells the level of tRNA2Ser drops 5-fold under the fastest growth condition.Figure 1:Autoradiographs of Northern blot hybridizations of RNA fractionated in 1.2% agarose gels. The hybridizations were performed with probes specific for 16 S rRNA as well as for tRNA2Ser (A) and tRNA5Ser (B). The RNA preparations were from strain W1485 (lanes 1-5) and strain W1485-fis767 (lanes 6-10). The bacteria were grown in M9 + acetate (lanes 1 and 6), M9 + succinate (lanes 2 and 7), M9 + glucose (lanes 3 and 8), complete medium (lanes 4 and 9), and LB medium + glucose (lanes 5 and 10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The accumulation of another rare serine acceptor tRNA, tRNA3Ser, is found to be coupled to the production of rRNA in wild type bacteria. In contrast, accumulation of tRNA3Ser is decoupled from the production of 16 S rRNA in fis cells although not as drastically as we observe for tRNA2Ser. Transfer RNA3Ser is cotranscribed with four copies of the tRNA2Arg gene in the serV operon(1Komine Y. Adachi T. Inokuchi H. Ozeki H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 96: 69-86Google Scholar), and its regulatory response is similar to the previously described tRNA2Arg. Finally, the 16 S rRNA-normalized levels of the abundant tRNA5Ser, transcribed by two separate operons at positions 20’ and 23’, are constant at different growth rates in both wild type and fis cells (, Fig. 1, and Fig. 2). In conclusion, tRNA2Ser and tRNA3Ser belong to the group of tRNA species that depend on FIS for their growth rate regulation. The tRNA1Ser and tRNA5Ser species behave as rRNA; they are growth rate-regulated, but the accumulation of the gene products is unaffected by deletion of the fis gene. The threonine isoacceptor tRNA family in E. coli, consists of four species with three unique anticodons(1Komine Y. Adachi T. Inokuchi H. Ozeki H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 96: 69-86Google Scholar). Predictions based on the unmodified anticodon suggest that tRNA1Thr and tRNA3Thr, with identical anticodons, translate the major threonine codons, AC(U/C), whereas tRNA2Thr and tRNA4Thr translate the minor ACG and AC(A/G) codons, respectively. The gene for threonine isoacceptor 1 is located in the ribosomal RNA operon, rrnD (1Komine Y. Adachi T. Inokuchi H. Ozeki H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 96: 69-86Google Scholar). As expected, the accumulation of tRNA1Thr is coupled to the accumulation of 16 S rRNA in both wild type and fis cells (see Fig. 3). In contrast, regulation of tRNA2Thr, expressed from the thrW operon(1Komine Y. Adachi T. Inokuchi H. Ozeki H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 96: 69-86Google Scholar), is strongly affected by the deletion of the fis gene (and Fig. 3). There is already a 35% reduction in the abundance of this tRNA at the slowest growth rate in fis bacteria, and the level decreases additionally 3-fold at the fastest growth rate. Two threonine-accepting tRNA species, tRNA3Thr and tRNA4Thr, are expressed from the thr(U)tufB operon(1Komine Y. Adachi T. Inokuchi H. Ozeki H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 96: 69-86Google Scholar). These tRNA genes are located in the same operon and are therefore expected to be expressed in a similar way at different growth rates. Indeed, in wild type cells the accumulation of both tRNA species is coupled to the accumulation of 16 S rRNA at various growth rates (Fig. 3). In fis cells growing in rich medium, the expression of these two tRNA genes is reduced 2-fold (Table I), which suggests that FIS is required for their high expression level. These results are consistent with the data of Nilsson et al.(11Nilsson L. Vanet A. Vijgenboom E. Bosch L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16Nilsson L. Verbeek H. Vijgenboom E. van Drunen C. Vanet A. Bosch L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the present data contradicts the finding by Lazarus and Travers(25Lazarus L.R. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), showing that the absence of FIS does not affect the expression level of the thr(U)tufB operon. Summarizing the regulation of the threonine-accepting tRNA family, tRNA2Thr, tRNA3Thr, and tRNA4Thr depend on FIS for their growth rate regulation. The tRNA1Thr is growth rate-regulated, but the accumulation of the gene products is unaffected by deletion of the fis gene.Table I:Comparison of individual tRNA levels accumulated in wild type and fis bacteria, grown in various medium compositions Open table in a new tab The impetus for this study is to illustrate further the involvement of FIS in the growth rate-dependent regulation of individual tRNA species in E. coli. In a previous study, we found that the growth rate-dependent expression of arginine, methionine, and leucine-accepting tRNA species can be divided into four groups pertaining to the effect of deleting the fis gene(17Nilsson L. Emilsson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The accumulation rate of one group of tRNA species decreases in the absence of FIS. A second group of tRNA species have been shown to increase their accumulation rate in the absence of FIS. The accumulation rate of a third group of tRNA species is growth rate-regulated but unaltered in fis cells. Thus, the regulatory response to the absence of FIS for these tRNA species is similar to the response found for rRNA(12Ross W. Thompson J.F. Newlands J.T. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). A fourth group contain tRNA species with a weak or undetectable increase in accumulation rate at faster growth rates, thus seeming to be under no growth rate regulation. The accumulation of these tRNA species is also unaffected by the absence of FIS. In the present study, we show that tRNA species within the serine and threonine acceptor families fall into two of these groups (Fig. 1). The growth rate-dependent accumulation of the tRNA2Ser, tRNA3Ser, tRNA2Thr, tRNA3Thr, and tRNA4Thr species is reduced in fis cells, suggesting that they are, directly or indirectly, activated by FIS and that the expression cannot be fully compensated for by relaxation of the ribosomal feedback system (see below). In fact, the accumulation of the rare tRNA species tRNA2Ser and tRNA2Thr is severely affected by the deletion of the fis gene, with a 5-fold lower accumulation rate under the fastest growth condition. We have previously shown that also the rare tRNA species tRNA4Arg and tRNA5Arg are affected by lack of FIS(17Nilsson L. Emilsson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in our studies, all rare tRNA species that are growth rate-regulated depend on FIS for this regulation. It has been suggested that two of these rare tRNA species are required for mechanisms other than translation. The cell division mutation ftsM1 has been mapped to the tRNA2Ser gene(26Leclerc G. Sirad C. Drapeau G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2090-2095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the tRNA4Arg gene complements a temperature-sensitive dnaY mutation. Since this mutation affects the polymerization phase of DNA replication, tRNA4Arg has been implicated in the replication process(27Mullin D.A. Garcia G.M. Walker J.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 669-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is shown that fis cells are defective in DNA replication and cell division control(28Gille H. Egan J.B. Roth A. Messer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4167-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29Filutowicz M. Ross W. Wild J. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 398-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FIS binds to the origin of replication (oriC), and it has been suggested that the lack of FIS bound to oriC in fis cells causes the replication and cell division defects. However, a recent study shows that FIS does not stimulate the replication process in vitro(30Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24999-25003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative explanation is that the fis cell defects are caused by reduced levels of tRNA4Arg and tRNA2Ser. An altered cell morphology, presumably due to the cell division and replication defects, is only seen at fast growth rates of fis cells, when the levels of tRNA4Arg and tRNA2Ser are most dramatically reduced.3 3V. Emilsson and L. Nilsson, unpublished observation. The expression levels of the three tRNA genes encoding tRNA3Ser, tRNA3Thr, and tRNA4Thr are also reduced when the fis gene is deleted but to a lesser degree than the levels of tRNA2Ser and tRNA2Thr. The tRNA3Thr and tRNA4Thr genes are located in the thrU(tufB) operon. This operon was the first to be shown to be regulated by FIS(11Nilsson L. Vanet A. Vijgenboom E. Bosch L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Using an operon fusion where the tufB gene was replaced with the gene for galactokinase, it was shown that approximately half of the growth rate-dependent increase in the expression of galactokinase depended on the presence of the FIS-binding sequence upstream of the promoter(16Nilsson L. Verbeek H. Vijgenboom E. van Drunen C. Vanet A. Bosch L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Lazarus and Travers (25Lazarus L.R. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have reported that the wild type thrU(tufB) promoter is not FIS-dependent. They ascribed the previous result to a cryptic down-mutation in the promoter region. This discussion is made more complicated by the finding of Vind et al.(31Vind J. Sbfrensen M.A. Rasmussen M.D. Pedersen S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 678-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), showing that the expression of reporter genes from strong promoters on multicopy plasmids is not linear in relation to mRNA levels. We demonstrate that fast growing fis cells contain half the amount of the threonine-accepting tRNA species that is under the control of the thrU(tufB) promoter compared with wild type cells. Our data are in good agreement with previously reported data (16Nilsson L. Verbeek H. Vijgenboom E. van Drunen C. Vanet A. Bosch L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but in clear contrast to the data of Lazarus and Travers(25Lazarus L.R. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The accumulation rates of the Ser1, Ser5, and Thr1 tRNA species increase at faster growth rates. However, the expression level of these RNA species is not reduced by the deletion of the fis gene. These and other tRNA species whose growth rate-dependent regulation responds only mildly to the absence of FIS must therefore be regulated by other means. There is evidence suggesting that at least one mechanism by which these tRNA species are regulated is identical to the ribosomal feedback system, as discussed below. It is clear that the accumulation rate of individual tRNA species respond differently to the absence of FIS. What causes these differences? It is a strong correlation between the accumulation rates of different tRNA species within one operon, both in the presence and absence of FIS(17Nilsson L. Emilsson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Emilsson V. Kurland C.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4359-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Emilsson V. Näslund A.K. Kurland C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We also observed this pattern in the present study. Here, the Thr3 and Thr4 tRNA species, which genes are located in the thrU(tufB) operon, are coupled to the accumulation of 16 S rRNA in wild type cells while their accumulation is decoupled from 16 S rRNA production in fis cells. Also, Ser3 and Arg2 tRNA species are regulated identically in both strains (see Ref. 17Nilsson L. Emilsson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for Arg2 tRNA). Finally, the expression of the Thr1 tRNA gene, located in rrnD together with rRNA genes, is coupled to the expression of rRNA in wild type and fis bacteria at various growth rates. Our data suggest that tRNA accumulation is regulated predominantly at the transcription initiation level. In the absence of the upstream activating sequences, transcription from the thrU(tufB) promoter is drastically increased in fis cells compared to wild type bacteria(11Nilsson L. Vanet A. Vijgenboom E. Bosch L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16Nilsson L. Verbeek H. Vijgenboom E. van Drunen C. Vanet A. Bosch L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The thrU(tufB) promoter lacking an upstream activating sequence cannot bind FIS in vitro(11Nilsson L. Vanet A. Vijgenboom E. Bosch L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Bosch L. Nilsson L. Vijgenboom E. Verbeek H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), indicating that the lowered expression from the upstream activating sequence-less construct in wild type cells is not due to an inhibitory binding of FIS to the promoter region. Such a compensatory mechanism is also noted for the rrnB operon ending at position +1(12Ross W. Thompson J.F. Newlands J.T. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which argues against the involvement of any downstream elements. We suggest that this compensation is caused by the ribosomal feedback system. Evidence exists that ppGpp is not involved in the ribosomal feedback inhibition. Gaal and Gourse (7Gaal T. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5533-5537Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have shown that the growth rate-dependent regulation of the rrnB operon is unaffected in cells incapable of producing ppGpp. This seems not to be caused by an increased FIS-dependent activation of the rrnB operon since a minipromoter construct without any FIS binding sites is still growth rate-regulated in ppGpp-less bacteria (33Bartlett M.S. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5560-5564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletions of one or several rRNA operons result in increased expression of the remaining rRNA operons. This is not accompanied by a decrease in ppGpp levels, suggesting that the ribosomal feedback inhibition is uncoupled from the ppGpp-dependent regulatory mechanism(34Condon C. French S. Squires C. Squires C.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4303-4315Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that the findings above have been questioned by Hernandez and Bremer(35Hernandez V.J. Bremer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10851-10862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who have found that the rrnB promoter is not growth rate-regulated in cells lacking ppGpp. It is also noticeable that both the ppGpp-dependent repression of stable RNA synthesis and the ribosomal feedback mechanism have been shown to depend on the promoter region only(36Gourse R. de Boer H.A. Nomura M. Cell. 1986; 44: 197-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 37Mizushima-Sugano J. Kaziro Y. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38Zacharias M. Göringer H.U. Wagner R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6271-6275Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We suggest that the combination of FIS-dependent activation and inhibition due to the ribosomal feedback system determines the growth rate-dependent regulation of the tRNA genes. We suggest that the four groups of tRNA species that we find correspond to tRNA species located in operons regulated by 1) FIS, 2) the ribosomal feedback system, 3) both FIS and the ribosomal feedback system, and 4) none of these mechanisms. Genes regulated by FIS alone should have a growth rate-dependent regulation that disappears or is severely reduced in fis cells. Transfer RNA2Ser and tRNA2Thr belong to this group. Genes regulated by the ribosomal feedback system only should have an increased expression in fis cells. We did not find tRNA species in the threonine and serine families with this regulatory pattern, but we have previously shown that tRNA3Leu, tRNAeMet, and tRNAfMet belong to this group(17Nilsson L. Emilsson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the gene is regulated by both mechanisms, a relaxation of the ribosomal feedback system should compensate for the absence of FIS, as is the case for the expression from rrnB(12Ross W. Thompson J.F. Newlands J.T. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In this investigation, tRNA1Ser, tRNA5Ser, and tRNA1Thr illustrate this group. The last group of tRNA species have poor or no growth rate regulation, suggesting that they are neither regulated by FIS nor by the ribosomal feedback system. None of the threonine or serine tRNA species belong to this group, but previous results show that tRNA2Leu, tRNA4Leu, tRNA5Leu, and tRNA3Arg have a poor growth rate regulation and the that expression of these tRNA species is unaffected by the absence of FIS(17Nilsson L. Emilsson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intermediates between the groups are also found. Several tRNA species such as tRNA1Leu, tRNA2Arg, tRNA3Thr, and tRNA4Thr have slightly reduced expression in the absence of FIS (Fig. 3 and Ref. 17Nilsson L. Emilsson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as expected if the ribosomal feedback system only partly compensates for the lack of FIS. We have demonstrated a strong dependence on a functional FIS protein for the gene expression of several tRNA species under steady state growth rates of bacteria. We find that for tRNA genes that are dependent on FIS for their up-regulation, the requirement for FIS is most significant under rich growth conditions. Furthermore, the collected data of the 20 tRNA species studied so far suggest that the abundance of bulk tRNA is reduced in fis cells at fast growth rates. The limited supply of translating tRNA species and the unbalance in the tRNA pool in fis cells may partly explain the marked differences in the growth rates between wild type and fis bacteria in rich media.

PCC 6803 that carry deletions of conserved residues in the plastoquinone-binding niche of the D1 protein were used to select for spontaneous mutations that restore photoautotrophic growth. Spontaneous pseudorevertants emerged from two deletion mutants, ΔYNIV and ΔNN, when the cultures were maintained long after the carbon source (glucose) had been depleted from the medium and cells had reached stationary phase. Most pseudorevertants were found to contain tandem duplications of 6-45-base pair DNA sequences located close to the domain carrying the deletion; none of them restored the wild-type sequence. Three pseudorevertants isolated from the ΔYNIV mutant contained a duplication (7-15 codons) of the DNA sequence immediately downstream of the deletion; the protein region encoded by this DNA may include part of the putative de helix, an important constituent of the plastoquinone-binding niche. Three pseudorevertants isolated from the ΔNN mutant contained duplications corresponding to 2-8 amino acid residues adjacent to the site of the deletion. In all six pseudorevertants carrying duplications, the length of the D1 protein in the modified regions was restored to at least the length present in wild type, suggesting that a minimal length of these protein domains may be required for functional integrity. In another photoautotrophic strain isolated from ΔNN, no secondary mutations could be identified in the gene coding for the D1 protein; such mutations apparently reside on another protein subunit of the photosystem II complex. Photosystem II function in the pseudorevertants was altered as compared with wild type in terms of growth and oxygen evolution rates, photosystem II concentration, the semiquinone equilibrium at the acceptor side, and thermostability. A mechanism leading to tandem sequence duplication may involve DNA damage followed by DNA synthesis, strand displacement, and ligation."
