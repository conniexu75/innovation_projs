https://openalex.org/W2063134736,"Intracellular recordings from pairs of neurons in slices of rat hippocampus directly demonstrated electronic coupling between CA3 pyramidal cells. When two neurons were impaled simultaneously (as verified by subsequent double staining with horseradish peroxidase), current pulses injected into one cell caused voltage changes in other cells. These interactions were bidirectional. Fast prepotentials, historically thought to represent spike activity in dendrites, resulted from action potentials in other electronically coupled pyramidal cells. These data directly demonstrate electrotonic coupling between neurons in the mammalian brain and indicate that some fast prepotentials are coupling potentials. Coupling between pyramidal cells could mediate synchronization of normal rhythmic activity and of burst discharges during seizures."

https://openalex.org/W2122364936,"Two lines of investigation supported the premise that killing of Staphylococcus aureus, 502A, by hydrogen peroxide involves formation of the more toxic hydroxyl radical (.OH) through the iron-dependent Fenton reaction. First, growing S. aureus overnight in broth media with increasing concentrations of iron increased their content of iron and dramatically enhanced their subsequent susceptibility to killing by H2O2. Second, in direct relation to their effectiveness as .OH scavengers, thiourea, dimethyl thiourea, sodium benzoate, and dimethyl sulfoxide inhibited H2O2-mediated killing of S. aureus."
https://openalex.org/W1917517429,"Oxygen radicals are suspected as being a cause of the cellular damage that occurs at sites of inflammation. The phagocytic cells that accumulate in areas of inflammation produce superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, and probably singlet oxygen in the extracellular fluid. The mechanism by which these oxygen molecules kill cells is unknown. To determine which of the oxygen species is responsible for the cellular killing, we exposed human fibroblasts in culture to oxygen radicals generated by the enzymatic action of xanthine oxidase upon acetaldehyde. Using the amount of chromium-51 released from labeled fibroblasts as an index of cellular death, we found that cells were protected only by interventions that reduce hydrogen peroxide concentration. Agents that inactivate superoxide, hydroxyl radical, and singlet oxygen were ineffective in limiting oxygen radical-induced cellular death."

https://openalex.org/W2070206012,"An increase in the metabolism of phosphatidylinositol occurs in a wide variety of tissues by the action of specific ligands1–3. In platelets, the interaction of thrombin with its receptor initiates the degradation of phosphatidylinositol by the action of a specific phospholipase C (refs 4–8). In normal conditions of stimulation, the resultant 1,2-diacylglycerol is rapidly and completely phosphorylated to phosphatidic acid4–11. The formation of phosphatidic acid precedes the release of arachidonic acid from the phospholipids of stimulated platelets5. This early appearence of phosphatidate might result in the initial production of arachidonic acid and lysophosphatidic acid by the action of a phospholipase A2 specific for phosphatidate12. Phosphatidate/lysophosphatidate could induce calciumgating13–15 and subsequently stimulate phospholipases of the A2-type8, that degrade phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and a further fraction of phosphatidylinositol6. Alternatively, the lysophosphatidate produced may serve as a substrate for the transfer of arachidonate directly from other phospholipids16,17 to form new phosphatidate which in turn can release more arachidonate. Overall, such a sequence would be equivalent to phospholipase A2 activation of other phospholipids. Our present data indicate that when the release of arachidonic acid is completely inhibited by cyclic AMP or quinacrine, phosphatidic acid is redirected entirely to phosphatidylinositol and there is no production of arachidonate. In these conditions, the availability of calcium might be profoundly restricted. The correlation in platelets of a phosphatidylinositol by a specific phospholipase A2 might suggest that these phenomena are applicable to activations in other cell systems."

https://openalex.org/W2082315293,"Postaggregation Dictyostelium discoideum cells contain 3000 mRNA species that are absent from preaggregation cells; these aggregation-dependent sequences comprise 30% of the mass of mRNA in these cells. We show that the synthesis and stability of these regulated mRNA sequences are affected by both cell-cell contact and cAMP. Three independent assays are used to quantitate these mRNAs: in vitro translation followed by two-dimensional gel analysis of the protein products; hybridization of gel-separated RNAs to cloned DNAs; and hybridization of mRNA to a cDNA probe specific for the population of regulated sequences. In postag-gregation cells, the half-life of both the developmentally regulated mRNAs and the constitutive mRNAs present throughout growth and differentiation is the same—about 4 hr. Following disaggregation, all of the late mRNA sequences are degraded and decay with a half-life of 25 to 45 min. The constitutive species are unaffected; 2.5 hr after disaggregation, the ratio of late to constitutive mRNAs is about 6% that of normal plated cells. Addition of cAMP to cells that have been disaggregated for 2.5 hr (or longer) restores the level of most late mRNAs within 3 hr. We conclude that cAMP stimulates the synthesis of these mRNAs and may also act to stabilize them in the cytoplasm. This effect of cAMP is dependent on the cells having been in contact with other cells; cAMP has no effect on the levels of mRNA in suspension-starved, aggregation-competent cells that have never formed cell-cell aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W2158498299,"Addition of exogenous NADH to rotenone- and antimycin A-treated mitochondria, in 125 mM KCl, results in rates of oxygen uptake of 0.5-1 and 10-12 nanoatoms of oxygen X mg protein-1 X min-1 in the absence and presence of cytochrome c, respectively. During oxidation of exogenous NADH there is a fast and complete reduction of cytochrome b5 while endogenous or added exogenous cytochrome c become 10-15% and 100% reduced, respectively. The reoxidation of cytochrome b5, after exhaustion of NADH, precedes that of cytochrome c. NADH oxidation is blocked by mersalyl, an inhibitor of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase. These observations support the view of an electron transfer from the outer to the inner membrane of intact mitochondria. Both the rate of exogenous NADH oxidation and the steady state level of cytochrome c reduction increase with the increase of ionic strength, while the rate of succinate oxidation undergoes a parallel depression. These observations suggest that the functions of cytochrome c as an electron carrier in the inner membrane and as an electron shuttle in the intermembrane space are alternative. It is concluded that aerobic oxidation of exogenous NADH involves the following pathway: NADH leads to NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase leads to cytochrome b5 leads to intermembrane cytochrome c leads to cytochrome oxidase leads to oxygen. It is suggested that the communication between the outer and inner membranes mediated by cytochrome c may affect the oxidation-reduction level of cytosolic NADH and the related oxidation-reduction reactions."

It was therefore surprising to discover that flavan itself (Table 1) is a highly effective inhibitor of the replication of certain serotypes of rhinovirus, and that a simple derivative, BW683C (4′,6-dichloroflavan), is the most potent antiviral compound yet reported. The present work examines the antiviral activity of flavan derivatives with a view to selecting the compound most suitable for trial in volunteers infected with a common cold virus."
https://openalex.org/W2065979650,"We have isolated five clones containing human histone genes from a human genomic DNA library, using a cloned X. laevis histone H4 cDNA probe (pX1ch4). Each genomic clone has been mapped and the locations of the histone genes have been determined by blot hybridization and hybridization-selection of human histone mRNA. In contrast to the organization of previously characterized histone genes, the human histone genes are clustered in the genome but are not arranged into recognizable repeating units. The extreme lack of organization of the human histone genes may reflect the diminished requirement for rapid synthesis of large quantities of histone proteins during mammalian early development."
https://openalex.org/W1519180525,"The effects of insulin and glucagon on the (Na+-K+)-ATPase transport activity in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were investigated by measuring the ouabain-sensitive, active uptake of 86Rb+. The active uptake of 86Rb+ was increased by 18% (p less than 0.05) in the presence of 100 nM insulin, and by 28% (p less than 0.005) in the presence of nM glucagon. These effects were detected as early as 2 min after hepatocyte exposure to either hormone. Half-maximal stimulation was observed with about 0.5 nm insulin and 0.3 nM glucagon. The stimulation of 86Rb+ uptake by insulin occurred in direct proportion to the steady state occupancy of a high affinity receptor by the hormone (the predominant insulin-binding species in hepatocytes at 37 degrees C. For glucagon, half-maximal response was obtained with about 5% of the total receptors occupied by the hormone. Amiloride (a specific inhibitor of Na+ influx) abolished the insulin stimulation of 86Rb+ uptake while inhibiting that of glucagon only partially. Accordingly, insulin was found to rapidly enhance the initial rate of 22Na+ uptake, whereas glucagon had no detectable effect on 22Na+ influx. These results indicate that monovalent cation transport is influenced by insulin and glucagon in isolated rat hepatocytes. In contrast to glucagon, which appears to enhance 86Rb+ influx through the (Na+-K+)-ATPase without affecting Na+ influx, insulin stimulates Na+ entry which in turn may increase the pump activity by increasing the availability of Na+ ions to internal Na+ transport sites of the (Na+-K+)-ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W1493227275,"During the early suckling period in the rat, active calcium uptake by the intestine is refractory to stimulation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. To determine the role that the specific cytosolic receptor for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 plays in this refractory state, the concentration of the receptor and its binding characteristics were measured during the neonatal period. From Scatchard analysis, the concentration of receptor in the adult intestine was 563 +/- 64 fmol/mg of protein. At 28 and 21 days postpartum, receptor concentrations were 711 +/- 129 and 251 +/- 36 fmol/mg of protein, respectively. Estimates from sucrose density gradient profiles and Scatchard analyses indicated that, at 14 and 7 days postpartum, receptor concentrations were less than 50 fmol/mg of protein. Equilibrium dissociation constants were similar at all times measured and ranged from 0.38 to 0.52 nM. These results suggest that the lack of response observed in the early neonatal intestine to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 may stem, at least in part, from the relative absence of receptors for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Furthermore, the appearance of the receptor may be the determining factor in the initiation of active calcium absorption in the intestine and its regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1545142973,"oxidations of organic sulfides, amines, and even enzymes catalyzed by purified and microsomal forms of prostaglandin cyclooxygenase-hydroperoxidase have been studied using O2 incorporation into arachidonic acid to monitor oxygenase and [14C]15-hydroperoxyprostaglandin E2 reduction to prostaglandin E2 to measure hydroperoxidase. The oxygenase was protected by phenol against the irreversible deactivation induced by low levels of hydroperoxides. Furthermore, the EPR signal noted during reactions with the microsomal enzyme probably reflected the adventitious oxidation of endogenous materials. As described previously for phenol and other reducing cosubstrates, methyl phenyl sulfide (MPS) increased hydroperoxidase activity at all concentrations studied, while stimulating oxygenase at low levels and inhibiting it at 5-10 mM. In stoichiometric equivalence with 15-hydroperoxyprostaglandin E2 reduction, MPS was enzymatically oxidized to its analogous sulfoxide, methylphenyl sulfoxide, acquiring an oxygen atom exclusively from the hydroperoxide and demonstrating some chiral character. In contrast, other oxidizable compounds such as N,N-dimethylphenylenediamine and aminopyrine reacted via radical intermediates. Phenylbutazone, which is oxidized using dissolved molecular oxygen, did not compete with MPS oxidation. Hence, MPS was oxidized while bound to the enzyme, whereas the amine oxidation occurred in solution via an enzyme-formed oxidant. The Soret peak noted with cyclooxygenase-hydroperoxidase was examined as a possible measure of this binding, but was also noted in denatured and deactivated enzyme, suggesting that its relevance should be reconsidered. Despite the similarities in their drug-metabolizing profiles, cyclooxygenase-hydroperoxidase is clearly distinct from cytochrome P-450. The mechanism of this hydroperoxidase is considered in the context of other more extensively studied peroxidases."

Smaller amounts of gastrin were found in nerve fibers of the neural lobe and pituitary stalk. Since adrenocorticotropic hormone—like peptides occur in antropyloric gastrin cells, these data indicate a considerable similarity in peptide composition of pituitary and gastrointestinal endocrine cells and reinforces questions of multiple hormone production."

https://openalex.org/W1979084109,"The chromosomal DNA sequence adjacent to one end of the single ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) in the micronucleus of Tetrahymena has been isolated by cloning. Using this sequence as a hybridization probe the organization of the same sequence in the somatic macronucleus has been examined. The restriction enzyme digestion maps of this sequence in the two nuclei are very different. Detailed mapping studies suggest that a chromosome break has occurred near the junction between the rDNA and the neighboring sequence during the formation of the macronucleus. As a result the flanking sequence is located near a free chromosome end in the macronucleus. The existence of such a linear DNA end has also been shown by digestion with the exonuclease Bal 31. In addition to the breakage, some sequences at this junction are found to be eliminated from the macronucleus. This observation has been interpreted in relation to the mechanism of rDNA amplification, which in Tetrahymena generates extrachromosomal rDNA molecules during macronucleus development."
https://openalex.org/W2074463629,"Morphine and D-Ala2-Met-enkephalin as well as other opioids suppress potassium-stimulated release of 3H-labeled dopamine from neurons tissue of two marine invertebrates, Mytilus edulis and Octopus bimaculatus. Naloxone reverses the inhibitory effects in both species. Potassium-stimulated release of 3H-labeled serotonin is not altered by opioids. It is postulated that opiate receptors and their endogenous effectors play a prominent role in regulation of transmitter release in invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1559469796,"Two forms of the extracellular cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.17) of Dictyostelium discoideum have been purified. One species has a molecular weight of about 55,000 measured by gel filtration and has been purified to apparent homogeneity. This monomeric form of the enzyme can be resolved by isoelectrofocusing into 4 bands with isoelectric points between 7.5 and 9. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two bands with molecular weights of 50,000 and 48,000. The second form of the enzyme has been partially purified and has a higher molecular weight (150,000-200,000) and an isoelectric point of about 5. The high molecular weight form of the enzyme is converted to the low molecular weight monomer by isoelectrofocusing in the presence of 6 M urea. Under these conditions the isoelectric point is shifted to that of the monomeric form of the enzyme. The two species are immunologically indistinguishable after urea treatment, and react identically with the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor (see the accompanying paper: Franke, J., and Kessin, R. H. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 7628-7637). The two forms have the same Km and show equal sensitivity to a number of ions, chelators, and low molecular weight cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Tryptic maps of the purified monomeric enzyme and the urea dissociated high molecular weight form revealed no differences."
https://openalex.org/W1494178313,"The subcellular localization of the post-translational processing steps which occur in the conversion of pro-adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)/endorphin into beta-endorphin-sized molecules in rat intermediate pituitary has been studied. Primary cell cultures were incubated in radioactively labeled amino acids, and a subcellular fraction containing secretory granules was separated from a subcellular fraction containing rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus by centrifugation of homogenates on gradients on Percoll (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals). The radiolabeled beta-endorphin-related material in the granule and rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus fractions was quantitated by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A pulse-chase labeling experiment demonstrated that newly synthesized beta-endorphin-related material first appeared in the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus fraction and after longer incubations (chase) appeared in the secretory granule fraction. After 2 h of chase incubation, about 85% of the beta-endorphin-related material synthesized during the 30-min pulse incubation had been transferred from the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus to the secretory granule fraction. The conversion of most of the newly synthesized pro-ACTH/endorphin into beta-lipotropin occurred in the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus fraction, whereas the conversion of most of the beta-lipotropin into beta-endorphin-sized molecules occurred in the secretory granule fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1522354146,"Cytochrome oxidase was incorporated into lipid vesicles composed of phosphatidylethanolamine-phosphatidylcholine-cardiolipin. Large proteoliposomes of 1,000-15,000 A diameter were prepared by calcium-induced fusion of small vesicles. Rotational diffusion of cytochrome oxidase was measured by detecting the decay of the absorption anisotropy, r(t), after photolysis of the heme a3.CO complex by a vertically polarized laser flash. Because of the large size of the proteoliposomes, there was no contribution of vesicle-tumbling to r(t) over the experimental time range of 5 ms for samples in 60% sucrose. Analysis of r(t) curves was based on a rotation-about-membrane normal model. The measurements were used to investigate intermolecular interactions between cytochrome oxidases and between cytochrome oxidase and cytochrome bc1 complex co-reconstituted in the above lipid vesicles. In vesicles of a high lipid to protein ratio (congruent to 27), nearly all cytochrome oxidase molecules are rotating with an approximate rotational relaxation time, phi 1, on the order of 500 microseconds. In contrast, about 20% of cytochrome oxidase is immobile in vesicles with a relatively low lipid to protein ratio (congruent to 5), although phi 1 of the mobile population remains about 500 microseconds. In contrast, about 20% of cytochrome oxidase is immobile in vesicles with a relatively low lipid to protein ratio (congruent to 5), although phi 1 of the mobile population remains about 500 microseconds. The immobilized fraction is presumably due to nonspecific self-aggregation of cytochrome oxidase. The presence of cytochrome bc1 complex does not change r(t) curves significantly, either in the presence or absence of cytochrome c. Previously, we have observed the co-existence of mobile and immobile populations of cytochrome oxidase in bovine heart and rat heart mitochondria (Kawato, S., Sigel, E., Carafoli, E., and Cherry, R. J. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 5508-5510). The present results suggest that the immobile population of about one-half of cytochrome oxidase could be simply due to nonspecific protein aggregation resulting from the high concentration of enzymes in the inner mitochondrial membrane (lipid to protein ratio, less than or equal to 0.5). We also conclude that there is no specific interaction between cytochrome oxidase and cytochrome bc1 complex in the above large lipid vesicles. A lateral collision-controlled model for electron transfer from cytochrome bc1 complex to cytochrome oxidase through cytochrome c is discussed based on the above results."
https://openalex.org/W1582874430,"Phosphorylation of rabbit skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase occurs with a Km of about 230 microM and Vmax approaching that seen with histone as a substrate. The rate of phosphorylation of phosphofructokinase by protein kinase is increased by allosteric activators of phosphofructokinase, whereas inhibitors of phosphofructokinase inhibit the phosphorylation. Inhibitors and activators change Vmax but not Km. The site of phosphorylation is a serine residue that is the sixth amino acid from the carboxyl terminus. Limited proteolysis by trypsin releases an octapeptide from the carboxyl terminus and a brief exposure to subtilisin releases a dodecapeptide from the carboxyl end. The sequence of the dodecapeptide is His-Ile-Ser-Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser(P)-Gly-Glu-Ala-Thr-Val. Phosphofructokinase isolated from a rabbit injected 18 h prior to killing with [32P]PO4 contained covalently bound radioactive phosphate. Approximately 80% of the phosphate was released in a trichloroacetic acid-soluble form following limited proteolysis by trypsin, under which conditions the enzyme remained with a monomer size of about 80,000 daltons. The position of elution from Sephadex G-25 of the phosphopeptide was identical with that found following limited trypsin proteolysis of in vitro labeled enzyme. Migration of the phosphopeptides on thin layer cellulose chromatography was also identical. We conclude that at least 80% of the radioactive phosphate introduced within 18 h of an intravenous injection of [32P]PO4 is found at the same site as that introduced by phosphorylation with the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2404722860,"We have studied the transcript processing of the split gene COB (or BOX) in yeast mtDNA, in both wild type and cob- mutants. Using various DNA fragments specific for coding or intervening sequences of this gene, we have determined the composition of splicing intermediates by DNA/RNA hybridization. The pattern of splicing intermediates detected in wild type reveals differing rates of the five splicings resulting in an apparent pathway of processing rather than an absolute order among the five cut and splice events. Effects of mutations in four of the five sequences have been studied. All of them interfere with transcript processing. Some block the excision of the sequence mutated only, but allow other splicing events to occur essentially as in the wild type. They suggest that in these mutants any order of splicings is possible, but that some are preferred. In contrast, other mutations located in four different sequences block several splicings simultaneously and thus suggest the existence of an obligatory order of events. In order to reconcile these findings we discuss the following hypotheses. (i) Some intervening sequences in COB specify products which are involved in transcript splicing; (ii) the biosynthesis of trace amounts of these products occurs on splicing intermediates. Their formation requires a certain order of splicing events to occur on a small number of COB transcripts. (iii) If expressed and functional, the intervening sequence-encoded products, together with other components, act on the bulk of COB transcripts, resulting in the steady state pattern of splicing intermediates observed in wild type."

https://openalex.org/W1591021359,"RecA- mutants of Escherichia coli extensively degrade their DNA following UV irradiation. Most of this degradation is due to the recBC DNase, which suggests that the recA gene is involved in the control of recBC DNase in vivo. We have shown that purified recA protein inhibits the endonuclease and exonuclease activities of recBC DNase on single-stranded DNA. The extent of inhibition is dependent on the relative concentration of recA protein, recBC DNase, and the DNA substrate; inhibition is greatest when the concentrations of DNA and recBC DNase are low and the concentrations of recA protein is high. At fixed concentrations of recA protein and recBC DNase, inhibition is eliminated at high concentrations of DNA. In the presence of adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), an ATP analog which stabilizes the binding of recA protein to both single- and double-stranded DNA, recA protein is a more potent inhibitor of the nuclease activities on single-stranded DNA and is a weak inhibitor of the exonuclease activity on double-stranded DNA. Inhibition of the latter is enhanced by oligodeoxynucleotides, which stimulate the binding of recA protein to double-stranded DNA. In the presence of adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), recA protein also inhibits the action of exonuclease I on single-stranded DNA and of lambda exonuclease on double-stranded DNA. These observations are most consistent with the idea that recA protein protects DNA from recBC DNase by binding to DNA. RecA protein also blocks the endonucleolytic cleavage of gapped circular DNA by recBC DNase. Since both recA protein and recBC DNase have the ability under certain conditions to unwind duplex DNA and to displace strands, we looked for evidence that their combined action would enlarge gaps but found no extensive enlargement. D-loops, a putative intermediate in genetic recombination, are effectively protected against the action of recBC DNase by the E. coli single strand binding protein and by recA protein in the presence of adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)."

https://openalex.org/W1526518048,"Mung bean seeds possess a tetrameric galactose-binding protein that displays two types of activities: (a) a hemagglutinin activity, and (b) an alpha-galactosidase activity. This protein can be reversibly converted by pH changes from a tetrameric form, which possesses both enzymic and hemagglutinin activities, to a monomeric form which possesses enzymic activity only. This observation suggests that the enzymic phytohemagglutinin is an aggregated form of a monomeric alpha-galactosidase. The tetrameric alpha-galactosidase has a pH optimum of about pH 7.0, while the monomeric form displays a pH optimum of 5.6. Circular dichroism difference spectra and inhibition studies suggest that aggregation induces conformational changes in the subunits sufficient to alter their enzymatic properties. The possibility of in vivo changes in subunit equilibria, when combined with the accompanying alterations in activity, provides a new concept worthy of consideration with respect to the physiological role of phytohemagglutinins."
https://openalex.org/W1489793799,"Abstract C6 glioma cells grown in medium containing fetal bovine serum have a decreased beta-adrenergic receptor number and beta-receptor-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation as compared to cells grown in a serum-free, defined medium. The decreased number of receptors and decreased cAMP accumulation are attributable to a suppression of receptor binding and response by serum as opposed to increases produced by growth in the defined medium. Serum, when added to cells grown in the absence of serum, stimulated cellular cyclic AMP levels to 2-3 times basal levels. This direct stimulatory effect was blocked by incubation of the cells with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol and was partially reversed by dialysis of the serum. In contrast, addition of serum to cells that have been grown with serum fails to stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation. The decrease in receptors following growth in serum can be mimicked by growing cells in serum-free medium in the presence of beta-adrenergic agonists such as isoproterenol or norepinephrine. Radioenzymatic assays indicate that fetal bovine serum contains approximately 0.3 nM norepinephrine and lower concentrations of epinephrine. It thus appears that growth of C6 cells in serum-containing media desensitizes the beta-adrenergic receptor/cyclic AMP system of these cells. This desensitized state appears to result primarily from the action of catecholamines present in serum. These data indicate that retained catecholamines are one component in serum that can modify expression of beta-adrenergic receptors and hormonal response of cultured glioma cells."

M., and Chappell, J. T., (1964) Biochem. J. 90, 147-149) is described. These analogs were tested as substrates for acetate kinase in the presence of several divalent metal ions. Both isomers of ATP alpha S are substrates in the presence of Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+, the Sp isomer being preferred by a factor of between 4.8 (Mg2+) and 52.5 (Cd2+). Only the Rp isomer of ATP beta S is a substrate in the presence of Mg2+, and the Sp isomer becomes a better substrate in the presence of Mn2+, Co2+, and Zn2+; both isomers are equally good substrates in the presence of Cd2+. The change in specificity upon replacing Mg2+ by Cd2+ is greater than 1800 at beta-phosphorus and 10 at alpha phosphorus. These results provide a basis for proposing that the lambda screw sense configuration of the beta, gamma-bidentate MgATP complex is the substrate for acetate kinase. In the reverse reaction, both Sp and Rp isomers of ADP alpha S are substrates in the presence of all metal ions tested, the Sp isomer preferred by a factor between 12.3 (Mg2+) and 45.5 (Cd2+). In the presence of Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+, only the Rp isomer of ATP beta S is synthesized from prochiral ADP beta S, while a mixture of Rp and Sp isomers is synthesized in the presence of Zn2+ and Cd2+. These results are analogous to those for the forward reaction and suggest that the Mg.ADP complex which binds as a substrate in the reverse reaction, and is released as a product in the forward reaction, is the beta-monodentate. The classification of acetate kinase as an enzyme having a type I mechanism (Dunaway-Mariano, D. and Cleland, W. W. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 1506-1515) for kinases, is discussed."

A similar photodegradation pattern was observed for 2,2', 3,4,4', 5,5' -heptabromobiphenyl, the second largest component of Firemaster."
