https://openalex.org/W2072668724,"Mouse macrophages can be stimulated by interferon (IFN)-γ and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to produce nitric oxide (NO) as the result of expression of the inducible NO synthase (iNOS; EC 1.14.13.39) gene. The iNOS gene promoter contains a candidate γ-interferon- activated site (GAS). In transfection studies reported here, it was demonstrated that a luciferase reporter-gene construct, containing four synthetic copies of the iNOS GAS, was inducible when transfected macrophages were stimulated with either IFN-γ, LPS, or a combination of the two. Consistent with this finding were other transfection analyses, which showed that responsiveness of the intact iNOS promoter to these same agents was significantly reduced when two conserved nucleotide positions within the GAS were mutated. Oligonucleotide probes, which mimicked the iNOS GAS, formed a complex with proteins that appeared in the nuclei of IFN-γ or IFN-γ+ LPS-treated macrophages within 30 min of stimulation, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. LPS alone also caused the the appearance of a nuclear protein capable of binding the iNOS GAS-containing oligonucleotide; however, in contrast to binding induced by IFN-γ, approximately 2 h of stimulation with LPS were required. The protein bound to the iNOS GAS-containing oligonucleotide reacted specifically with an antibody raised against Stat1α, regardless of the stimulus used. These data collectively support the conclusion that binding of Stat1α to the iNOS promoter's GAS is required for optimal induction of the iNOS gene by IFN-γ and LPS.

Its biological effects include vasorelaxation (1Palmer R.M. Ferrige A.G. Moncada S. Nature. 1987; 327: 524-526Google Scholar), inhibition of platelet aggregation (2Radomski M.W. Palmer R.M.

Neurosci. 1991; 14: 60-67Google Scholar), as well as microbial and tumor cell killing (4Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, production of NO from the substrate, L-arginine, is catalyzed by NO synthase (NOS) (5Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Google Scholar). Three related genes encode isoforms of NOS in different tissues. Neuronal and endothelial NOS are both constitutively expressed and each is dependent upon Ca2+/calmodulin for activity (6Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Google Scholar, 7Busse R. Mülsch A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 133-136Google Scholar). Mouse macrophages, and many other cell types, express an inducible isoform of NOS (iNOS) that accumulates after cell activation by stimuli such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) plus bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This latter isoform functions independently of intracellular Ca2+ (8Cho H.J. Xie Q. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Google Scholar), because it has calmodulin bound as an integral subunit. In addition to the beneficial functions noted above, NO production has been associated with tissue damage (9Liu R.H. Hotchkiss J.H. Mutat. Res. 1995; 339: 73-89Google Scholar) and septic shock (10MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q.-w. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Chen H. Mudgett J.S.

Those known to be active include κB sites located both in the enhancer (13Murphy W.J. Muroi M. Zhang X. Suzuki T. Russell S.W. J. Endotoxin Res. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar, 14Goldring C.E.P.

The candidate γ-interferon-activated site (GAS), located in the enhancer (nucleotide positions −942 to −934), has been reported in one study to be nonfunctional in regulating iNOS gene expression (17Martin E. Nathan C. Xie Q. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 977-984Google Scholar). An extensive evaluation of this finding has not been established, however. GAS elements are known to bind homodimers of a phosphorylated form of the 91-kDa transcription factor, Stat1α (STAT stands for signal transducer and activator of transcription; reviewed in Darnell et al. (19Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar)) which is a latent cytoplasmic protein. Treatment of cells with IFN-γ causes tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1α by the IFN-γ receptor-associated Janus kinases 1 and 2. Subsequently, phosphorylated Stat1α forms homodimers and translocates into the nucleus where it induces transcription of GAS-containing genes. Other STAT proteins, e.g. Stat3-6, which are induced by growth factors and cytokines other than IFN-γ, bind to DNA elements that are closely related to the GAS (20Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 877-889Google Scholar, 21Bacon C.M. Petricoin III, E.F. Ortaldo J.R. Rees R.C. Larner A.C. Johnston J.A. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7307-7311Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that the candidate iNOS GAS is, indeed, necessary for optimal IFN-γ-, LPS-, and IFN-γ+ LPS-mediated induction of the iNOS promoter. Furthermore, Stat1α, unlike Stats 3-6, is able to bind the iNOS GAS in IFN-γ-, LPS-, or IFN-γ+ LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. These data provide evidence for the direct involvement of Stat1α in the transcriptional induction of the mouse iNOS gene. The macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7 (American Type Culture Collection no. TIB-71, Rockville, MD) was used in all studies. Cells of this line were cultured in spinner flasks containing 25 mM Hepes-buffered RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, which contained 10% (v/v) Fetal Clone I bovine serum product (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mM glutamine (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), and 100 units/ml penicillin (APOTHECON, Princeton, NJ). The lipid A-rich fraction II of LPS was phenol-extracted from Escherichia coli O111:B4 and obtained from List Biological Laboratories, Inc. (Campbell, CA). Recombinant mouse IFN-γ (1.27 × 106 antiviral units/mg) was provided by Schering-Plough through the American Cancer Society (Atlanta, GA). Endotoxin was undetectable in all culture media and reagents, at a sensitivity of 50 pg/ml, as determined by the Limulus amebocyte assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Woods Hole, MA). Restriction enzymes and T4 polynucleotide kinase were obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 4,500 mCi/mmol) was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. The plasmid pGLH/H2 (12Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Google Scholar), containing the full-length iNOS promoter cloned into the pGL2 Basic luciferase reporter gene vector (Promega, Madison, WI), was used for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the GAS and ISRE using the Unique Site Elimination (U.S.E.) mutagenesis protocol from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., according to the manufacturer's instructions. After mutagenesis, both the enhancer and basal promoter of each construct were sequenced to confirm that the appropriate mutations were isolated and that no ectopic mutations within other iNOS functional elements had been introduced. Four copies of the iNOS gene's GAS and two copies of the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene's GAS (both synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) were each cloned upstream of a thymidine kinase basal promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene of pGL2-Basic. The identity of each construct was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. All plasmid DNA was purified by two sequential CsCl/ethidium-bromide equilibrium centrifugations. Each construct (3 pmol) was transfected into RAW 264.7 cells by electroporation (12Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6839-6847Google Scholar). A human growth hormone expression vector, pXGH5, was cotransfected (0.6 pmol/transfection) as an internal control of transfection efficiency. Cells from three electroporations were pooled to eliminate differences between individual transfections and the mixture then equally divided among 12 wells of a 24-well cluster dish (Corning CoStar Corp., Cambridge, MA). They were next allowed to adhere to the substratum for 2 h before the medium was changed. After 72 h (which were needed to reduce background levels of luminescence), the medium was again changed and triplicate cultures were incubated for 8 h with medium alone or medium that contained either 100 units/ml IFN-γ, 100 ng/ml LPS, or a combination of the two stimuli. The cells were then assayed for luciferase activity and human growth hormone production, as described previously (12Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Google Scholar). The results of human growth hormone assays showed that there was no significant difference in the relative efficiency of transfection between constructs (data not shown), consistent with earlier reports (12Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Google Scholar, 13Murphy W.J. Muroi M. Zhang X. Suzuki T. Russell S.W. J.

All data are reported as fold induction, which was calculated by dividing the relative light units of each stimulated culture with that of the corresponding unstimulated control culture and averaging three independent experiments. The average is reported along with the standard error of the mean. Each pair of complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc., Custom Primers) was end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed, as described by Muroi et al. (23Muroi M. Muroi Y. Yamamoto K. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19534-19539Google Scholar). Unlabeled, annealed oligonucleotides were used as cold competitors. The top strand sequence of each oligonucleotide used was: iNOS GAS, 5′-CTTTTCCCCTAACAC-3′; mutated GAS (GASmt), 5′-CTTTGCCCCTACCAC-3′ (the mutated nucleotides are underlined); and NF-IL6, 5′-TCACATTGTGCAATCTTAATAAGG-3′. The oligonucleotide that contained the NF-IL6 binding site was used as a nonspecific competitor. Cell cultures were incubated in medium alone or treated with either 100 units/ml IFN-γ, 100 ng/ml LPS, or 100 units/ml IFN-γ plus 100 ng/ml LPS for the times indicated in the legends to Fig. 2, Fig. 3. Nuclear extracts were prepared from these cultures as described by Sadowski and Gilman (24Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Google Scholar) and modified by adding sucrose to a final concentration of 7.5% immediately after cell homogenization (25Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 47-55Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 30 μl by preincubating 10-20 μg of nuclear extract (see legends to Figs. 3 and 4 for specific quantities) for 5 min with reaction buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 40 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol) that contained 4% Ficoll, 4 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. 32P-Labeled oligonucleotide (0.05 pmol) was then added, and the incubation was continued for 25 min. For competition or supershift assays either a 40-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide or 1 μg of antibody, respectively, was added to the reaction mixture following the preincubation period. Incubation was then continued for 10 min before the labeled oligonucleotide was added, after which the incubation was extended for another 15 min. All reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature. A 5% native polyacrylamide gel, containing 0.2 × TBE (18 mM Tris base, 18 mM boric acid, 0.4 mM EDTA), was pre-electrophoresed at 350 V at 4°C until the current fell to about 7 mA. Twenty-five μl of each reaction mixture were then loaded, and the gel was electrophoresed for 2 h and 15 min.Fig. 3Identification of the iNOS GAS-binding protein by supershift analysis. The nuclear extracts and radiolabeled oligonucleotide employed here are the same as those in Fig. 2. Panel A, nuclear extracts were prepared from RAW 264.7 cells cultured in medium alone (lane 1) or for 30 min in medium that contained IFN-γ (lanes 2-7). Ten μg of nuclear extract were used in each lane. Reaction mixtures electrophoresed in lanes 1 and 2 contained no other additions. In reaction mixtures electrophoresed in each of lanes 3-7, the nuclear extract was preincubated in the presence of antibody raised against either Stat1α (lane 3), Stat3 (lane 4), Stat4 (lane 5), Stat5 (lane 6), or Stat6 (lane 7), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The dried polyacrylamide gel was exposed to x-ray film for approximately 48 h. Panel B, binding reactions are similar to those in panel A except that nuclear extracts were prepared from RAW 264.7 cells cultured either in medium alone (lane 1) or for 2 h in medium that contained LPS alone. Twenty μg of nuclear extract were used in each lane, and the dried polyacrylamide gel was exposed to x-ray film for approximately 6 days. Panel C, binding reactions are similar to those in panel A except that nuclear extracts were prepared from RAW 264.7 cells cultured either in medium alone (lane 1) or for 30 min in medium that contained IFN-γ+ LPS. Ten μg of nuclear extract were used in each lane and the dried polyacrylamide gel was exposed to x-ray film for approximately 48 h. The supershifted bands in each panel are indicated by open arrowheads.

Nathan C. Xie Q. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 977-984Google Scholar), a simple, direct test of its activity was sought to assess the validity of this earlier observation. The approach chosen was to test expression of a linked reporter gene using synthetic promoters. Two luciferase reporter-gene constructs were made. One of these contained four tandem copies of the iNOS GAS and the second, two tandem copies of the IRF-1 GAS as a positive control. Each was linked to a synthetic thymidine kinase (TK) basal promoter. RAW 264.7 macrophages were transfected with each of these reporter constructs, stimulated with either IFN-γ, LPS, or the combination of IFN-γ+ LPS, and assayed for luciferase activity (Table I). The four iNOS GAS copies mediated an approximate 3-fold increase in luciferase reporter gene activity when transfected cells were stimulated with IFN-γ, a 1.6-fold increase when stimulated with LPS, and more than a 3-fold increase when stimulated with IFN-γ+ LPS. These results strongly suggested that the iNOS GAS is functional in response to each of these three stimuli. The inductive capacity of the IRF-1 GAS was greater than that of the iNOS GAS. This was evidenced by the fact that the IRF-1 GAS construct, which had only two elements driving the TK promoter, compared with four in the iNOS GAS construct, yielded more than twice the fold induction when either IFN-γ alone or IFN-γ+ LPS were used as stimuli. By contrast, there was no significant difference (p = 0.27 by Student's t test) between the fold induction observed with the two constructs using LPS alone as stimulus.Table ITrans-activation of a TK promoter-linked luciferase reporter gene by the iNOS and IRF-1 GAS elementsConstructFold inductionMediumIFN-γLPSIFN-γ+ LPS4 × NOS GAS1.02.8 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.23.4 ± 0.32 × IRF-1 GAS1.08.8 ± 3.21.3 ± 0.37.9 ± 3.0 Open table in a new tab To determine whether the iNOS GAS is functional in the environment of the iNOS promoter, mutational analyses were undertaken. Three constructs were made (one containing the wild-type iNOS promoter, a second containing the iNOS promoter bearing a two-nucleotide mutation in the GAS, and a third containing the iNOS promoter bearing a two-nucleotide mutation in the strong, distal ISRE) and transfected into RAW 264.7 macrophages. This was followed by stimulation of cell cultures with IFN-γ, LPS, or IFN-γ+ LPS. As shown in Fig. 1, RAW 264.7 macrophages transfected with a construct containing the GAS mutation showed a significant 2-3-fold decrease in luciferase production, depending upon the stimulus, when compared with cells transfected with the wild-type construct. The reporter construct containing the mutated strong, distal ISRE also showed decreased responsiveness to these mediators. The extent of reduction was found to be equivalent to that seen for the mutated GAS. This not only indicated that the GAS is functional in regulating mouse iNOS gene expression, but also that it is as important as the strong, distal ISRE. In view of the results reported above, it was predicted that the iNOS GAS should bind one or more nuclear proteins after cellular stimulation with IFN-γ, LPS, or a combination of the two. To test this prediction, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using nuclear extracts from RAW 264.7 macrophages. By using a 15-base pair probe that contained the iNOS GAS, a specific binding complex (denoted by the arrowhead in Fig. 2, A-C) was detected in stimulated, but not unstimulated, cells (Fig. 2, A-C, compare lanes 2 with lanes 1, respectively). The specificity of this binding complex was demonstrated by the fact that unlabeled iNOS GAS oligonucleotide could compete effectively for binding (Fig. 2, A-C, lanes 3), while an unrelated NF-IL6 oligonucleotide could not (Fig. 2, A-C, lanes 5). Additional confirmation of specificity was obtained by using an oligonucleotide in this competition study that contained a mutated iNOS GAS sequence (the same two mutations introduced into the luciferase reporter-gene construct used for mutational analysis, above); this oligonucleotide also did not compete for binding (Fig. 2, A-C, lanes 4). In addition to the specific complex, we also detected nonspecific binding complexes both in unstimulated and stimulated cells (Fig. 2, A-C, indicated by the bracket). In RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with either IFN-γ or IFN-γ+ LPS, the appearance of the specific binding complex was rapid, occurring within 30 min of stimulation (Fig. 2, A and C). However, in LPS-stimulated macrophages this binding complex was not observed at 30 min (data not shown) but, rather, required approximately 2 h of stimulation before it became detectable (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the relative amount of binding activity induced by LPS was greatly reduced, compared with that stimulated by IFN-γ or IFN-γ+ LPS, as indicated by the fact that more nuclear extract, and longer exposure times were required to achieve the autoradiographic result shown in Fig. 2B (refer to the legend in Fig. 2). To identify the nuclear protein(s) that specifically bound to the iNOS GAS, we next performed antibody supershift assays. Antibodies specific for each of five members of the STAT family of transcription factors (Stat1, Stat3-6), which are known to be activated either by IFN or by other cytokines or hormones (26Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Google Scholar, 27Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B. Silvennoinen O.

Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Google Scholar) and known to bind sequences related to the GAS, were used in these supershift assays. Antibody against Stat1α was the only one able to supershift the specific binding complex, and it could do so in assays of nuclear extracts from cells stimulated with either of the two stimuli, or by the combination of both (Fig. 3, A-C, indicated by the open arrowhead). It was concluded from these results that the specific binding complex identified by EMSA contains Stat1α. The results presented are important because they show that the enhancer-linked GAS is, in fact, active in the induction of transcription of the mouse macrophage iNOS gene in response to LPS ± IFN-γ. In addition, it has been shown here that the transcription factor Stat1α binds to this GAS and that such binding occurs regardless of whether RAW 264.7 cells are stimulated with IFN-γ or LPS. Finally, the results shown here indicate that while both IFN-γ and LPS treatment of mouse macrophages cause the binding of Stat1α to the iNOS gene, there is a temporal difference between the two. Mouse macrophages can be induced by the combination IFN-γ+ LPS to produce NO even at concentrations of these two mediators that, by themselves, are ineffective. In other words, the two mediators function synergistically (31Lorsbach R.B. Murphy W.J. Lowenstein C.J. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1908-1913Google Scholar). This would seem to suggest that IFN-γ and LPS induce separate, complementary signaling pathways that are both required for optimal expression of the iNOS system. However, at high concentrations of LPS alone (i.e. greater than 10 ng/ml), iNOS gene expression and NO production occur in a dose-dependent manner. Upon first consideration, this would seem inconsistent with the hypothesis that IFN-γ and LPS generate independent signals. It has recently been demonstrated, however, that high levels of LPS also induce mouse macrophages to produce IFN-β, and that autocrine/paracrine stimulation by this mediator is critical to the LPS-mediated production of NO (32Zhang X. Alley E.W. Russell S.W. Morrison D.C. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 33-40Google Scholar, 33Fujihara M. Ito N. Pace J.L. Watanabe Y. Russell S.W. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12773-12778Google Scholar). The delayed induction of Stat1α binding by LPS alone, compared with IFN-γ alone or IFN-γ+ LPS, is consistent with the fact that autocrine/paracrine IFN-β plays a role in LPS-mediated activation of mouse macrophages for NO production. The likely reason that lower GAS binding activity is generated by IFN-β is that most of the tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1α produced by this stimulus is sequestered into the transcription factor ISGF-3, although small amounts of Stat1α homodimers are detectable in type-I IFN-stimulated cells (34Seegert D. Strehlow I. Klose B. Levy D.E. Schindler C. Decker T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8590-8595Google Scholar). ISGF-3 binds to a subset of ISREs that differ in sequence from the iNOS ISRE. IFN-γ, by contrast, induces predominantly GAS-binding homodimers of Stat1α (19Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar, 20Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 877-889Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that the lower level of iNOS promoter induction caused by LPS (and autocrine/paracrine IFN-β) versus IFN-γ+ LPS is likely the result of lower availability of Stat1α homodimers generated by LPS which, in turn, are needed to bind the GAS maximally. It should be noted, however, that other autocrine/paracrine factors produced by LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages, such as IL-6 and IL-10, also cause the tyrosine-phosphorylation of Stat 1α (reviewed in Finbloom and Larner (20Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 877-889Google Scholar)). It is possible, therefore, that these mediators could be the source of a portion of the GAS binding activity seen in LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. In addition to a direct role for Stat1α in iNOS gene activation, this transcription factor can also act indirectly. For example, it is required for induction of the IRF-1 gene (35Rein T. Muller M. Zorbas H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3033-3037Google Scholar), which encodes the IRF-1 transcription factor that binds the two juxtaposed ISREs in the iNOS promoter's enhancer. In IRF-1 knockout mice, IFN-γ+ LPS induces virtually no iNOS mRNA accumulation or NO production. This is in spite of the fact that all other transcription factors necessary for iNOS gene induction (i.e. NF-κB, Stat1α, and octamer binding factors) are ostensibly available to interact with cis-regulatory elements of the iNOS gene. In work reported elsewhere (13Murphy W.J. Muroi M. Zhang X. Suzuki T. Russell S.W. J. Endotoxin Res. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar), we have similarly shown that mutation of the enhancer-linked κB element of the iNOS promoter abolishes responsiveness of the enhancer not just to LPS, but to added IFN-γ as well. This is in spite of the fact that NF-κB itself is not activated by IFN-γ. The targeted disruption of the Stat1 gene also abolishes macrophage NO production in response to IFN-γ+ LPS (36Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C.F. Bach E.A. Rodig S.J. Dighe A.S. Kaplan D.H. Riley J.K. Geenlund A.C. Campbell D. Carver-Moore K. DuBois R.N. Clark R. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 431-442Google Scholar). However, it cannot be concluded from this result whether the effect is attributable directly to the absence of Stat1α or, indirectly to a relative lack of IRF-1. Taken together, the above observations suggest that transcription factors that interact with the iNOS enhancer must do so cooperatively. Stated another way, iNOS gene expression appears to require the simultaneous presence of all transcription factors that bind its enhancer; when all are present transcription is enhanced, and when any one of them is absent transcription either remains off or is greatly reduced. This is consistent with the observation that the expression of iNOS in mouse macrophages is population-based (37Alley E.W. Zhang X. Russell S.W. J. Endotoxin Res. 1994; 1: 235-242Google Scholar, 38Pace J.L. Lowenstein C.J. Phillips T.A. Chen L.-C. Morrison D.C. Hunt J.S. Russell S.W. J. Endotoxin Res. 1994; 1: 227-233Google Scholar). Increases in iNOS expression are achieved by increasing the number of cells within the population that express the iNOS gene and, therefore, iNOS protein, indicating that expression of the iNOS system in individual cells is either fully on or off. This suggests that in the absence of maximal stimulation, such as by the combination of IFN-γ+ LPS, at least one transcription factor controlling iNOS gene expression may be limiting. By this reasoning, full expression of iNOS protein would only be achieved by those cells in the population that exceed threshold levels of the limiting factor(s). Stat1α may be that factor because increasing numbers of cells, in a given population, can be induced to express the iNOS gene when increasing concentrations of either IFN-β (37Alley E.W. Zhang X. Russell S.W. J. Endotoxin Res. 1994; 1: 235-242Google Scholar) or -γ (38Pace J.L. Lowenstein C.J. Phillips T.A. Chen L.-C. Morrison D.C. Hunt J.S. Russell S.W. J. Endotoxin Res. 1994; 1: 227-233Google Scholar) is added to LPS-stimulated cell cultures. In conclusion, a minimum of six, cis-acting regulatory elements are now known to control regulation of the mouse iNOS gene, two ISREs (16Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J.

Med. 1994; 180: 977-984Google Scholar), two κB elements (13Murphy W.J. Muroi M. Zhang X. Suzuki T. Russell S.W. J. Endotoxin Res. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar, 14Goldring C.E.P. Reveneau S. Algarté M. Jeannin J.-F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1682-1687Google Scholar, 15Xie Q. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar), an octamer element (14Goldring C.E.P. Reveneau S. Algarté M. Jeannin J.-F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1682-1687Google Scholar),2 and as shown here, a GAS. These are bound by transcription factors either activated or induced by LPS plus one of the interferons. The picture that emerges is one of complex regulation of the mouse iNOS gene, the product of which can be both beneficial (4Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Google Scholar, 18Billiar T.R. Ann. Surg. 1995; 221: 339-349Google Scholar) and detrimental (9Liu R.H. Hotchkiss J.H. Mutat. Res. 1995; 339: 73-89Google Scholar, 10MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q.-w. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Chen H. Mudgett J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Google Scholar) to the host. Although we do not yet understand the manner in which the transcription factors necessary for gene induction interact on the iNOS promoter, there are several indications that they must do so cooperatively. Identification of the various transcription factors involved and discovery of how they interact with one another on and, perhaps off, the iNOS promoter is essential to understanding transcriptional control of the mouse iNOS gene and, therefore, regulation of NO production.

https://openalex.org/W1975883081,"Within the lysosomal cysteine protease family, cathepsin B is unique due to its ability to act both as an endopeptidase and a peptidyldipeptidase. This latter capacity to remove C-terminal dipeptides has been attributed to the presence of a 20-residue insertion, termed the occluding loop, that blocks the primed terminus of the active site cleft. Variants of human procathepsin B, where all or part of this element was deleted, were expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. A mutant, where the 12 central residues of the occluding loop were deleted, autoprocessed, albeit more slowly than the wild type proenzyme, to yield a mature form of the enzyme with endopeptidase activity comparable with the wild-type cathepsin B, but totally lacking exopeptidase activity. This deletion mutant showed a 40-fold higher affinity for the inhibitor cystatin C, suggesting that the occluding loop normally restricts access of this inhibitor to the active site. In addition, the binding affinity of the cathepsin B propeptide, which is a potent inhibitor of this enzyme, was 50-fold increased, consistent with the finding that the loop reorients on activation of the proenzyme. These results suggest that the endopeptidase activity of cathepsin B is an evolutionary remnant since, as a consequence of its membership in the papain family, the propeptide must be able to bind unobstructed through the full length of the active site cleft.

INTRODUCTIONThe lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B is unique within the papain superfamily in that it acts both as an endopeptidase and an exopeptidase. Thus in addition to making internal cleavages (1Fosang A.J. Neame P.J. Last K. Hardingham T.E. Murphy G. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19470-19474Google Scholar), it also removes C-terminal dipeptide units from the substrate (peptidyldipeptidase activity) (2Aronson N.N. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 171: 759-765Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of cathepsin B suggests the molecular basis for this dual character. Relative to other papain-like proteases, cathepsin B contains an extra structural element termed the “occluding loop” (3Musil D. Zucic D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovic T. Turk V. Towatari T. Katunuma N. Bode W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Google Scholar), which blocks off one end of the substrate binding cleft (see Fig. 1a). As proposed by Schechter and Berger (4Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Google Scholar), the protease active site cleft is considered to consist of a series of subsites, each accommodating an amino acid residue of the peptide substrate. Those subsites binding the residues C-terminal to the peptide bond undergoing cleavage are termed the primed sites (S1′ to S3′) and accept the P1′ to P3′ substrate residues. The subsites accepting the N-terminal side of the substrate, the P1 to P3 residues, are termed the unprimed sites (S1 to S3, with the numbering in each case starting with the residues bordering the cleavage site). The structure of rat cathepsin B containing the covalently bound inhibitor Z-Arg-Ser(OBz)-chloromethylketone (where Z represents benzyloxycarbonyl and Bz represents benzoyl) (5Jia Z. Hasnain S. Hirama T. Lee X. Mort J.S. To R. Huber C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5527-5533Google Scholar) maps out the unprimed substrate binding subsites and indicates that the occluding loop plays a defining role in primed site specificity. The strategic position of two histidine residues in this loop (His110 and His111) 1Residue numbering relates to mature cathepsin B. suggests that they can act as acceptors for the negatively charged carboxylate of the P2′ residue C terminus. The structure of a human cathepsin B complex with the E-64 2The abbreviations used are: E-64trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butaneZ-Phe-Arg-MCAbenzyloxycarbonyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-arginine 4-methylcoumarinyl-7-amidePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideDTTdithiothreitol. analogue CA030 (the ethyl ester of epoxysuccinyl-Ile-Pro-OH) (6Turk D. Podobnik M. Popovic T. Katunuma N. Bode W. Huber R. Turk V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4791-4797Google Scholar) shows this can indeed be the case. The free carboxyl group on the proline residue in the dipeptide moiety of this inhibitor interacts with these two histidines suggesting that Ile and Pro occupy the P1′ and P2′ subsites, respectively, as would be expected for substrate binding in the exopeptidase mode.While the occluding loop appears to play an important role in the binding of substrates that are cleaved by the exopeptidase activity of cathepsin B, it would be expected to interfere with the binding of extended peptides. It would also be expected to obstruct the binding of protein protease inhibitors such as the cystatins, which in the case of the papain/stefin B complex have been shown to form extensive interactions with the protease primed sites (7Stubbs M.T. Laber B. Bode W. Huber R. Jerala R. Lenarcic B. Turk V. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1939-1947Google Scholar). Since the occluding loop represents a separate and relatively poorly ordered region of cathepsin B (5Jia Z. Hasnain S. Hirama T. Lee X. Mort J.S. To R. Huber C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5527-5533Google Scholar), we reasoned that it could be deleted without compromising the structure of the remaining enzyme.We have previously demonstrated the efficient recombinant expression of rat cathepsin B as an α-factor fusion construct in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8Rowan A.D. Mason P. Mach L. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15993-15999Google Scholar). This system proved much less effective for the expression of the human enzyme (9Mach L. Mort J.S. Glössl J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13030-13035Google Scholar); however, we have recently shown that high levels of human cathepsin B can be produced using similar constructs in the methanotropic yeast Pichia pastoris (10Sivaraman J. Coulombe R. Magny M.-C. Mason P. Mort J.S. Cygler M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 874-875Google Scholar). We have used this system to produce forms of human cathepsin B lacking the occluding loop and thus allowing us to evaluate its role in cathepsin B function.DISCUSSIONThe occluding loop of cathepsin B represents a unique structural element relative to the other members of the papain superfamily. The three-dimensional structures of cathepsin B (3Musil D. Zucic D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovic T. Turk V. Towatari T. Katunuma N. Bode W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Google Scholar) and of a cathepsin B complex with an inhibitor occupying the S1′ and S2′ subsites (6Turk D. Podobnik M. Popovic T. Katunuma N. Bode W. Huber R. Turk V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4791-4797Google Scholar) provide clues with respect to the exopeptidase activity. However, the relationship of the loop to endopeptidase activity is not clear. In order to study the role of the occluding loop, we have expressed a mutant of cathepsin B (M2) engineered to mimic the local structure of the other members of the papain superfamily. Although the folding of the precursor of this cathepsin B mutant did not appear to be altered significantly, as shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy (data not shown), this mutant did not autoprocess. In contrast, a more subtle deletion (M1) did allow processing to occur, albeit at a reduced rate relative to the wild-type precursor. Since the activation of wild type and mutant M1 procathepsin B proceeds by an autoactivation mechanism, the inability of the mutant M2 to undergo processing may be related to a stronger binding of the propeptide to the active site region. The slower autoprocessing of the mutant M1 and its higher affinity for the free propeptide support this proposal.Studies of the mature mutant M1 provide insight into the functional role of the loop. Its partial truncation reduced the stability of the molecule indicating that this structural element contributes to the stability of the protein. In fact, the three dimensional structure of cathepsin B shows that, while the loop is attached to the left domain of the enzyme, residues 108-119 interact with the right domain, suggesting that this region of the protein may be stabilized by interdomain interactions. In this regard, it was shown previously that interdomain perturbation in papain affects enzyme stability (27Vernet T. Tessier D.C. Khouri H.E. Altschuh D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 501-509Google Scholar).The three-dimensional structure also suggested an explanation of the unique ability of cathepsin B to act as an exopeptidase (3Musil D. Zucic D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovic T. Turk V. Towatari T. Katunuma N. Bode W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Google Scholar, 6Turk D. Podobnik M. Popovic T. Katunuma N. Bode W. Huber R. Turk V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4791-4797Google Scholar). Indeed, while the mutant M1 was proteolytically active, it showed no detectable exopeptidase activity, validating the previously proposed role of the loop residues His110 and His111 as “acceptors” for the negative charge on the substrate P terminus. On the other hand, the Km for the endopeptidase substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA decreased five-fold, showing that the peptide is able to bind to the active site in a more efficient manner. Similar endoprotease activity against a protein substrate for the wild type and M1 was demonstrated although the value for the mutant M1 is likely to have been an underestimate due to its reduced stability.High molecular weight inhibitors also provide a method to probe active site accessibility. The recently determined three-dimensional structures of rat (25Cygler M. Sivaraman J. Grochulski P. Coulombe R. Storer A.C. Mort J.S. Structure. 1996; 4: 405-416Google Scholar) and human (26Turk D. Podobnik M. Kuhelj R. Dolinar M. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 211-214Google Scholar) procathepsin B reveal that the occluding loop is a mobile element. In the precursor molecule, the loop adopts an alternate conformation to that occupied in the mature enzyme, no longer impeding access to the primed side of the active site cleft. Indeed, the free cathepsin B propeptide must trigger a similar conformational transition on binding to the mature enzyme as it is a potent, specific inhibitor of cathepsin B (20Fox T. de Miguel E. Mort J.S. Storer A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12571-12576Google Scholar) implying that it has the ability to displace the occluding loop. This finding also implies that shortening the loop should increase the binding affinity of the free propeptide to cathepsin B, a prediction confirmed on removal of 12 residues of the loop in the mutant M1 which enhanced the affinity of the free propeptide by more than 50-fold over that for the wild-type enzyme. As expected from the mechanism of the interaction, the on rate is increased while the off rate remains essentially unchanged.It was pointed out previously that the conformation of the occluding loop in mature cathepsin B is incompatible with cystatin binding (3Musil D. Zucic D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovic T. Turk V. Towatari T. Katunuma N. Bode W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Google Scholar), as reflected by the high Ki value for formation of the cystatin C/cathepsin B complex relative to that of cysteine proteases lacking the occluding loop (28Björk I. Pol E. Raub-Segall E. Abrahamson M. Rowan A.D. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 219-225Google Scholar). This is a similar situation to that described above for the binding of the propeptide and suggests that a significant alteration of the loop position occurs when the inhibitor binds to the cathepsin B active site. Indeed, partial deletion of the loop, as in the mutant M1, increases the affinity of cathepsin B for cystatin C by over 40-fold relative to the wild-type enzyme, a value similar to that found for propeptide inhibition. The Ki value for the mutant M1 approaches that reported for cathepsin L (23Abrahamson M. Mason R.W. Hansson H. Buttle D.J. Grubb A. Ohlsson K. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 621-626Google Scholar), a cysteine protease lacking the occluding loop. All of these kinetic and structural observations are consistent with the predictions from molecular modelling of increased access to the active site on deletion of the loop.Although the influence of the loop on the active site accessibility is clear, the occluding loop also has an influence on the hydrolytic activity of cathepsin B. For instance, the reduction of kcat by over 6-fold at pH 5.2 for the mutant M1 shows that the gain of binding efficiency (lower Km) is offset by a reduction in substrate turnover. Also, modification of the loop lowers the optimal pH of activity by over 2.5 pH units although the exact meaning of this effect remains obscure. The lack of symmetry of the pH-activity profile of wild-type cathepsin B has been attributed to the proximity of the loop and the protonation state of residues His110 and His111 (22Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar). Shortening of the loop with the consequent removal of these two residues promotes a more symmetrical profile. Taken together, these data show the dramatic effect of the loop on the mechanism of activity.Besides its demonstrated role in exopeptidase activity, the occluding loop of the cathepsin B clearly limits access of macromolecules to the active site. It is interesting to speculate on the evolution of cathepsin B from an ancestral papain-like cysteine protease (29Berti P.J. Storer A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 273-283Google Scholar). The addition of the occluding loop to facilitate peptidyldipeptidase activity had to remain compatible with the propeptide binding pattern and activation mechanism common to this family of enzymes, as demonstrated by the structures of procathepsin B and procathepsin L (25Cygler M. Sivaraman J. Grochulski P. Coulombe R. Storer A.C. Mort J.S. Structure. 1996; 4: 405-416Google Scholar, 30Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Ménard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Google Scholar). We propose, therefore, that the endoprotease activity retained by cathepsin B is an evolutionary remnant and that the main role of cathepsin B in its natural environment, the lysosome, is to act as an exopeptidase. The residual endopeptidase activity, while not essential intracellularly, still allows the enzyme to play an extracellular role as an endopeptidase that is poorly inhibited by cystatins (31Barrett A.J. Buttle D.J. Mason R.W. ISI Atlas of Sci: Biochem. 1988; : 256-260Google Scholar). This may have important pathological consequences.

The strategic position of two histidine residues in this loop (His110 and His111) 1Residue numbering relates to mature cathepsin B. suggests that they can act as acceptors for the negatively charged carboxylate of the P2′ residue C terminus.

Podobnik M. Popovic T. Katunuma N. Bode W. Huber R. Turk V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4791-4797Google Scholar) shows this can indeed be the case. The free carboxyl group on the proline residue in the dipeptide moiety of this inhibitor interacts with these two histidines suggesting that Ile and Pro occupy the P1′ and P2′ subsites, respectively, as would be expected for substrate binding in the exopeptidase mode. trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane benzyloxycarbonyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-arginine 4-methylcoumarinyl-7-amide polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis dimethyl sulfoxide dithiothreitol. While the occluding loop appears to play an important role in the binding of substrates that are cleaved by the exopeptidase activity of cathepsin B, it would be expected to interfere with the binding of extended peptides. It would also be expected to obstruct the binding of protein protease inhibitors such as the cystatins, which in the case of the papain/stefin B complex have been shown to form extensive interactions with the protease primed sites (7Stubbs M.T. Laber B. Bode W. Huber R. Jerala R. Lenarcic B. Turk V. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1939-1947Google Scholar). Since the occluding loop represents a separate and relatively poorly ordered region of cathepsin B (5Jia Z. Hasnain S. Hirama T. Lee X. Mort J.S. To R. Huber C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5527-5533Google Scholar), we reasoned that it could be deleted without compromising the structure of the remaining enzyme. We have previously demonstrated the efficient recombinant expression of rat cathepsin B as an α-factor fusion construct in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8Rowan A.D. Mason P. Mach L. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15993-15999Google Scholar). This system proved much less effective for the expression of the human enzyme (9Mach L. Mort J.S. Glössl J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13030-13035Google Scholar); however, we have recently shown that high levels of human cathepsin B can be produced using similar constructs in the methanotropic yeast Pichia pastoris (10Sivaraman J. Coulombe R. Magny M.-C. Mason P. Mort J.S. Cygler M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 874-875Google Scholar). We have used this system to produce forms of human cathepsin B lacking the occluding loop and thus allowing us to evaluate its role in cathepsin B function. DISCUSSIONThe occluding loop of cathepsin B represents a unique structural element relative to the other members of the papain superfamily. The three-dimensional structures of cathepsin B (3Musil D. Zucic D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovic T. Turk V. Towatari T. Katunuma N. Bode W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Google Scholar) and of a cathepsin B complex with an inhibitor occupying the S1′ and S2′ subsites (6Turk D. Podobnik M. Popovic T. Katunuma N. Bode W. Huber R. Turk V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4791-4797Google Scholar) provide clues with respect to the exopeptidase activity. However, the relationship of the loop to endopeptidase activity is not clear. In order to study the role of the occluding loop, we have expressed a mutant of cathepsin B (M2) engineered to mimic the local structure of the other members of the papain superfamily. Although the folding of the precursor of this cathepsin B mutant did not appear to be altered significantly, as shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy (data not shown), this mutant did not autoprocess. In contrast, a more subtle deletion (M1) did allow processing to occur, albeit at a reduced rate relative to the wild-type precursor. Since the activation of wild type and mutant M1 procathepsin B proceeds by an autoactivation mechanism, the inability of the mutant M2 to undergo processing may be related to a stronger binding of the propeptide to the active site region. The slower autoprocessing of the mutant M1 and its higher affinity for the free propeptide support this proposal.Studies of the mature mutant M1 provide insight into the functional role of the loop. Its partial truncation reduced the stability of the molecule indicating that this structural element contributes to the stability of the protein. In fact, the three dimensional structure of cathepsin B shows that, while the loop is attached to the left domain of the enzyme, residues 108-119 interact with the right domain, suggesting that this region of the protein may be stabilized by interdomain interactions. In this regard, it was shown previously that interdomain perturbation in papain affects enzyme stability (27Vernet T. Tessier D.C. Khouri H.E. Altschuh D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 501-509Google Scholar).The three-dimensional structure also suggested an explanation of the unique ability of cathepsin B to act as an exopeptidase (3Musil D. Zucic D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovic T. Turk V. Towatari T. Katunuma N. Bode W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Google Scholar, 6Turk D. Podobnik M. Popovic T. Katunuma N. Bode W. Huber R. Turk V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4791-4797Google Scholar). Indeed, while the mutant M1 was proteolytically active, it showed no detectable exopeptidase activity, validating the previously proposed role of the loop residues His110 and His111 as “acceptors” for the negative charge on the substrate P terminus. On the other hand, the Km for the endopeptidase substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA decreased five-fold, showing that the peptide is able to bind to the active site in a more efficient manner. Similar endoprotease activity against a protein substrate for the wild type and M1 was demonstrated although the value for the mutant M1 is likely to have been an underestimate due to its reduced stability.High molecular weight inhibitors also provide a method to probe active site accessibility. The recently determined three-dimensional structures of rat (25Cygler M. Sivaraman J. Grochulski P. Coulombe R. Storer A.C. Mort J.S. Structure. 1996; 4: 405-416Google Scholar) and human (26Turk D. Podobnik M. Kuhelj R. Dolinar M. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 211-214Google Scholar) procathepsin B reveal that the occluding loop is a mobile element. In the precursor molecule, the loop adopts an alternate conformation to that occupied in the mature enzyme, no longer impeding access to the primed side of the active site cleft. Indeed, the free cathepsin B propeptide must trigger a similar conformational transition on binding to the mature enzyme as it is a potent, specific inhibitor of cathepsin B (20Fox T. de Miguel E. Mort J.S. Storer A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12571-12576Google Scholar) implying that it has the ability to displace the occluding loop. This finding also implies that shortening the loop should increase the binding affinity of the free propeptide to cathepsin B, a prediction confirmed on removal of 12 residues of the loop in the mutant M1 which enhanced the affinity of the free propeptide by more than 50-fold over that for the wild-type enzyme. As expected from the mechanism of the interaction, the on rate is increased while the off rate remains essentially unchanged.It was pointed out previously that the conformation of the occluding loop in mature cathepsin B is incompatible with cystatin binding (3Musil D. Zucic D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovic T. Turk V. Towatari T. Katunuma N. Bode W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Google Scholar), as reflected by the high Ki value for formation of the cystatin C/cathepsin B complex relative to that of cysteine proteases lacking the occluding loop (28Björk I. Pol E. Raub-Segall E. Abrahamson M. Rowan A.D. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 219-225Google Scholar). This is a similar situation to that described above for the binding of the propeptide and suggests that a significant alteration of the loop position occurs when the inhibitor binds to the cathepsin B active site. Indeed, partial deletion of the loop, as in the mutant M1, increases the affinity of cathepsin B for cystatin C by over 40-fold relative to the wild-type enzyme, a value similar to that found for propeptide inhibition. The Ki value for the mutant M1 approaches that reported for cathepsin L (23Abrahamson M. Mason R.W. Hansson H. Buttle D.J. Grubb A. Ohlsson K. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 621-626Google Scholar), a cysteine protease lacking the occluding loop. All of these kinetic and structural observations are consistent with the predictions from molecular modelling of increased access to the active site on deletion of the loop.Although the influence of the loop on the active site accessibility is clear, the occluding loop also has an influence on the hydrolytic activity of cathepsin B. For instance, the reduction of kcat by over 6-fold at pH 5.2 for the mutant M1 shows that the gain of binding efficiency (lower Km) is offset by a reduction in substrate turnover. Also, modification of the loop lowers the optimal pH of activity by over 2.5 pH units although the exact meaning of this effect remains obscure. The lack of symmetry of the pH-activity profile of wild-type cathepsin B has been attributed to the proximity of the loop and the protonation state of residues His110 and His111 (22Hasnain S. Hirama T. Tam A. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4713-4721Google Scholar). Shortening of the loop with the consequent removal of these two residues promotes a more symmetrical profile. Taken together, these data show the dramatic effect of the loop on the mechanism of activity.Besides its demonstrated role in exopeptidase activity, the occluding loop of the cathepsin B clearly limits access of macromolecules to the active site. It is interesting to speculate on the evolution of cathepsin B from an ancestral papain-like cysteine protease (29Berti P.J. Storer A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 273-283Google Scholar). The addition of the occluding loop to facilitate peptidyldipeptidase activity had to remain compatible with the propeptide binding pattern and activation mechanism common to this family of enzymes, as demonstrated by the structures of procathepsin B and procathepsin L (25Cygler M. Sivaraman J. Grochulski P. Coulombe R. Storer A.C. Mort J.S. Structure. 1996; 4: 405-416Google Scholar, 30Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Ménard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Google Scholar). We propose, therefore, that the endoprotease activity retained by cathepsin B is an evolutionary remnant and that the main role of cathepsin B in its natural environment, the lysosome, is to act as an exopeptidase. The residual endopeptidase activity, while not essential intracellularly, still allows the enzyme to play an extracellular role as an endopeptidase that is poorly inhibited by cystatins (31Barrett A.J. Buttle D.J. Mason R.W. ISI Atlas of Sci: Biochem. 1988; : 256-260Google Scholar). This may have important pathological consequences.

The poorly differentiated cells at the edge of the islands were transfectable with liposome-DNA complexes (pCMVβ:LipofectACE = 1:5 (w/w)), whereas the more differentiated cells in the center of the islands were not. Evaluation of the steps leading to lipid-mediated transfection revealed that edge cells bound more liposome-DNA complexes, in part due to a more negative surface charge (as measured by cationized ferritin binding), and that edge cells internalized more liposome-DNA complexes than central cells. Edge cells exhibited receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL, pinocytosis of 10-nm microspheres, and phagocytosis of 2-μm microspheres, whereas central cells were only capable of receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Potassium depletion, which decreased phagocytosis by >90% but had no effect on pinocytosis, inhibited edge cell liposome-DNA complex entry by 71%. These results indicate that liposome-DNA complexes enter edge cells via phagocytosis and that this pathway is not detectable in central cells.

To map structural determinants of productive active site fatty acid binding, we mutated two amino acid residues, arginine 47 and phenylalanine 87, which flank the surface and heme ends of the enzyme's substrate access channel, respectively. Replacement of arginine 47 with glutamic acid resulted in a catalytically inactive mutant. Replacement of arginine 47 with alanine yielded a protein with reduced substrate binding affinity and arachidonate sp3 carbon hydroxylation activity (72% of control wild type). On the other hand, arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acid epoxidation was significantly enhanced (154 and 137%, of control wild type, respectively). As with wild type, the alanine 47 mutant generated (18R)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic, (14S,15R)-epoxyeicosatrienoic, and (17S,18R)-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids nearly enantiomerically pure. Replacement of phenylalanine 87 with valine converted cytochrome P450 BM-3 into a regio- and stereoselective arachidonic acid epoxygenase ((14S,15R)epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, 99% of total products). Conversely, metabolism of eicosapentaenoic acid by the valine 87 mutant yielded a mixture of (14S,15R)- and (17S,18R)-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (26 and 69% of total, 94 and 96% optical purity, respectively). Finally, replacement of phenylalanine 87 with tyrosine yielded an inactive protein. We propose that: (a) fatty acid oxidation by P450 BM-3 is incompatible with the presence of residues with negatively charged side chains at the surface opening of the substrate access channel or a polar aromatic side chain in the vicinity of the heme iron; (b) the high turnover regio- and stereoselective metabolism of arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids involves charge-dependent anchoring of the fatty acids at the mouth of the access channel by arginine 47, as well as steric gating of the heme-bound oxidant by phenylalanine 87; and (c) substrate binding coordinates, as opposed to oxygen chemistries, are the determining factors responsible for reaction rates, product chemistry, and, thus, catalytic outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2056553690,"Abstract Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), a nervous system cell adhesion molecule, is an I-type lectin that binds to sialylated glycoconjugates, including gangliosides bearing characteristic structural determinants (Yang, L.

Two cell adhesion systems, COS-1 monkey kidney fibroblasts transiently transfected to express MAG and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected to express MAG, were used to probe the structural specificity of MAG-ganglioside binding. Both cell types bound to the same gangliosides: GQ1bα (IV3NeuAc,III6NeuAc,II3(NeuAc)2-Gg4Cer) > GT1b = GD1a > GM3 > GM1, GD1b, and GQ1b (the latter do not support adhesion). Binding was enhanced by pretreatment of MAG-expressing cells with neuraminidase. MAG-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells bound directly to gangliosides resolved on thin layer chromatograms, allowing detection of MAG binding species in a mixture. The simplest ganglioside ligand for MAG was GM3 bearing N-acetylneuraminic acid, whereas GM3 bearing N-glycolylneuraminic acid did not support adhesion. Chemical modifications of N-acetylneuraminic acid residues (on GD1a) abrogated MAG binding. Mild periodate oxidation of sialic acids to their corresponding seven-carbon (or eight-carbon) sialic acid aldehydes abolished MAG binding, as did further conversion to the corresponding primary alcohols. Eliminating the anionic charge by ethyl esterification, amidation, or reduction also abolished MAG-mediated cell adhesion. These data demonstrate that MAG-ganglioside binding is highly specific and defines key carbohydrate structural determinants for MAG-mediated cell adhesion to gangliosides."

Co-expression and immunoprecipitation experiments detected an interaction between the K296P mutant and a bacteriophage T7-epitope-tagged K64E mutant of dsRNA binding domain. In contrast, the K64E/K296P double mutant did not form a detectable dimer with the wild-type dsRNA binding domain. These results support that dimerization of intact PKR with the isolated dsRNA binding domain requires dsRNA binding activity. Expression of the isolated PKR kinase domain (residues 228-551) reduced translation of the reporter mRNA even in the presence of PKR inhibitors. Furthermore, the isolated kinase domain (residues 228-551) undergoes autophosphorylation and sequentially trans-phosphorylates both mutant K296P PKR and wild-type eIF-2α in vitro. In contrast, the isolated kinase domain (residues 264-551) lacking the third basic region was not active. These observations lead us to propose that the dsRNA binding domains on intact PKR inhibit kinase activity and that dsRNA binding to intact PKR induces a conformational change to expose dimerization sites within the dsRNA binding domain thereby promoting dimerization and facilitating trans-phosphorylation and activation.

We have characterized this reaction by steady-state and transient-state kinetics with purified human AP endo, which had been expressed in Escherichia coli. The substrate was a 49-base pair oligonucleotide with an abasic site at position 21. This substrate was generated by treating a 49-mer duplex oligonucleotide with a single G/U located at position 21 with uracil-DNA glycosylase. The enzymatic products of the AP endo nicking reaction were a 20-mer with a hydroxyl group at the 3ʹ-terminus and a 28-mer with a phosphodeoxyribose at the 5ʹ-terminus. To obtain maximal enzymatic activity, it was necessary to stabilize the abasic site during treatment with uracil-DNA glycosylase with a reducing agent. Otherwise, a 20-mer with phosphoribose at the 3ʹ-terminus resulted from β-elimination. In agreement with others, Km and kcat were 100 nM and 10 s-1, respectively. Heat treatment of the abasic site-containing 49-mer without enzyme also resulted in conversion to the β-elimination product. The resultant heat degradation product was an efficient inhibitor of AP endo with a Ki of 30 nM. The enzyme required divalent cation (Mg2+) for activity, but bound substrate DNA in the absence of Mg2+. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that AP endo bound tightly to DNA containing an abasic site and formed a 1:1 complex at low enzyme concentrations. The association and dissociation rate constants for substrate binding to AP endo were determined by using a challenge assay to follow AP endo-substrate complex formation. Heat degradation product together with heparin served as an effective trap for free enzyme. The results are consistent with a Briggs-Haldane mechanism where kon and koff are 5 × 107M-1 s-1 and 0.04 s-1, respectively (Kd = 0.8 nM), kcat is 10 s-1, and product release is very rapid (i.e. koff,product≫ 10 s-1).

Human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (AP endo) 1The abbreviations used are: AP endoapurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleaseHDPheat degradation productbpbase pair(s)ESenzyme-substrate. (EC 3.1.25.2) is a bifunctional enzyme with the ability both to initiate repair of abasic sites in damaged DNA and to act as a redox protein in restoring promoter binding to oxidation-damaged Jun-Fos or Jun-Jun dimers (1Walker L.J.

In this report, we focus on the endonuclease function that is found in the carboxyl-terminal 250 residues (2Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 23-27Google Scholar, 7Barzilay G. Hickson I.D. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 713-719Google Scholar). AP endo makes a single cleavage in the phosphodiester backbone on the 5ʹ-side of the abasic site created by any of several DNA glycosylases and is, therefore, classified as a class II endonuclease (Fig. 1) (8Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 135-190Google Scholar, 9Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Google Scholar, 10Demple B.

Subsequently, in mammalian base excision repair, the phosphodeoxyribose remaining attached to the 5ʹ-end of the downstream DNA strand is removed by the amino-terminal 8-kDa domain of DNA polymerase β (11Matsumoto Y.

Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Google Scholar). apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease heat degradation product base pair(s) enzyme-substrate. The endonuclease activity of AP endo has been well characterized for its preference for abasic site-containing DNA and by steady-state kinetic analysis in the presence of divalent cation. In order to understand the kinetic basis for enzyme specificity and efficiency, each step in the reaction pathway needs to be characterized thermodynamically and kinetically. This is a prerequisite to rational drug design in developing efficient enzyme inhibitors to down-regulate DNA repair. In this paper, we examine substrate binding in detail to derive association and dissociation rate and equilibrium constants. These studies were facilitated by the observation that the spontaneous heat degradation product (HDP) of the oligonucleotide containing an abasic site is an effective inhibitor of human AP endo. The HDP was employed in a challenge assay to measure enzyme-DNA complex formation. Product complexes could not be formed during catalytic assays, indicating that product release was much faster than the nicking reaction. These results suggest a simple Briggs-Haldane mechanism for AP endo. The substrate for all enzyme assays, obtained either from Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA) or from Genosys (Woodlands, TX), was a 49-base pair (bp) oligomer containing a single G/U base pair at position 21. The single-stranded oligomer was labeled at the 5ʹ-end of the U-containing strand by means of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.) in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer. End-labeling was performed at 370C for 45 min. In some cases, the 49-mer was labeled at the 3ʹ-end by means of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Promega Corp.) and [α-32P]ddATP (Amersham Corp.). The abasic site was created by treating the double-stranded oligomer with uracil-DNA glycosylase (Epicentre Technologies) at 1 unit of enzyme/100 pmol of uracil residues, for 15-30 min at 370C. DNA substrate was quantified spectrophometrically. The buffer consisted of 50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM freshly prepared NaBH4, as indicated. The reaction was terminated by heating at 700C for 5 min. The mixture was allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. Steady-state enzyme assays were carried out at 250C for 5-120 s in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.02-20 nM AP endo, and 150 nM DNA in a volume of 5 μl. Assays were terminated either by the addition of urea-containing gel loading dyes or with EDTA to a final concentration of 70-85 mM. Products were resolved by gel electrophoresis using 8 M urea, 15% polyacrylamide gels (14Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Gel Electrophoresis of Nucleic Acids: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990Google Scholar), followed by autoradiography, and quantified with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). In some cases, products were restabilized before electrophoresis by treatment with 0.1 M NaBH4 for 30 min at 00C, followed by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 0.2 μg/ml tRNA. Enzyme activity was linear for up to 60 s in the range of 0.02-10 nM AP endo. AP endo could be limited to a single turnover by the addition of an enzyme trapping agent. Enzyme was preincubated with substrate, but without Mg2+, to form enzyme-substrate complex in the presence of 4 mM EDTA. Productive complex was then assayed by the addition of excess Mg2+ and trap (i.e. heparin and HDP). Heparin and HDP bind to free enzyme, as well as enzyme that dissociates from the substrate during the course of the reaction, making the dissociation reaction irreversible. Transient-state assays to determine the association and dissociation rate constants were carried out under single-turnover conditions. To determine the association and dissociation rate constants, kon and koff, respectively, enzyme and substrate were incubated for various periods up to 30 s under pseudo-first order conditions (i.e. substrate/enzyme = 10). At the end of each period, the amount of enzyme-DNA complex was measured by initiating enzymatic activity with the addition of Mg2+ (10 mM final concentration) and trap and incubating for an additional 10 s. The final volume was 5 μl. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 87 mM. Further details are outlined in the figure legend. Substrate DNA was prepared as described above, except that NaBH4 was omitted during generation of the abasic site. To prevent the formation of HDP, the reaction was not heated to terminate the uracil-DNA glycosylase step. Substrate DNA was incubated with AP endo at different concentrations for 45 min at 250C in the presence of 0.5% polyvinyl alcohol, 10% glycerol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM MgCl2. The inclusion of MgCl2 was not necessary for binding. The incubation mixture was loaded onto a 7% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and components were resolved by electrophoresis at 90 V (7 V/cm) for 6 h. The distribution of oligodeoxynucleotide bound and unbound forms was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Data were fitted to appropriate equations by nonlinear least squares methods. The association rate constant and steady-state time courses were simulated with HopKINSIM (15Wachsstock D.H. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1260-1273Google Scholar), a Macintosh version of the kinetic simulation program KINSIM (16Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Google Scholar). The association and dissociation rate constants were determined from the binding curves determined under pseudo-first order conditions. Assuming a simple one-step binding model (E + S ⇄ ES), the data should conform to a simple exponential where kobs = kon[S] + koff. The association and dissociation rate constants were determined from a secondary plot of kobs versus [S]. The HAP1h cDNA (3Cheng X. Bunville J. Patterson T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 370Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from HeLa cell DNA using the following primers: 5ʹ-AAAAATGCATATGCCGAAACGTGG-3ʹ (BAP.NsiI) and 5ʹ-CTCTTAATTAATCACAGAGCTAGGTATAGGGTAA-3ʹ (BAP.PacI). The BAP.NsiI primer added an NsiI restriction site (underlined) and created an NdeI restriction site (italicized) upstream of the coding sequence, which is shown in bold. The BAP.PacI primer added a PacI restriction site (underlined) downstream of the coding sequence. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NsiI and PacI and inserted into plasmid vector pXC20PacI, which had been digested with the same two enzymes. Vector pXC20PacI is a derivative of the phage λPL promotor vector pXC36 (17Cheng X. Patterson T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4591-4598Google Scholar) and will be described elsewhere. The resulting plasmid was named pXC49, and the nucleotide sequence of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A restriction fragment containing the entire HAP1h coding sequence plus a short segment of the vector 3ʹ to the coding sequence was prepared by complete digestion of pXC49 with BamHI followed by partial digestion with NdeI. The fragment was inserted into the phage T7 promotor expression vector pET3a (18Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D.-S. Lin S.-W. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 125-135Google Scholar), which had been digested to completion with NdeI and BamHI. The HAP1h expression vector this created was named pXC53. The structure of pXC53 was confirmed by restriction and DNA sequence analysis. Plasmids pXC49 and pXC53 were constructed as part of a larger study of HAP1h expression in Escherichia coli and will be described in more detail elsewhere. Human AP endo was expressed in E. coli strain BL21/DE3pLysS from pXC53 carrying the HAP1h gene. After induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 2 h, cells from a 2-liter culture were lysed in Buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) containing 500 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mM dithiothreitol by means of sonic disruption at 0-10C. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant fraction was adjusted to 100 mM NaCl by addition of Buffer A containing protease inhibitors and dithiothreitol. This was passed over a Q-Sepharose column (100 ml bed volume) connected in series to an S-Sepharose column of the same size. After washing with Buffer A containing 100 mM NaCl, the S-Sepharose column was developed with increasing concentrations of NaCl up to 1 M. AP endo, eluting at high salt (≫500 mM NaCl), was further purified by chromatography over a Mono S column by FPLC (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The purified enzyme, containing no measurable nuclease activity with double-stranded DNA substrate, eluted from the Mono S column at approximately 450 mM NaCl. The entire purification could be achieved in 2 days with a yield of greater than 6 mg of pure enzyme/liter of E. coli culture. Enzyme concentration was determined from Bradford assays (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), which had been calibrated by amino acid analysis. The ratio of protein concentration determined by amino acid analysis to that determined by the Bradford assay was 0.37. Amino-terminal sequencing of the purified enzyme indicated a single protein beginning with Pro2 of the human AP endo open reading frame. Truncation of the natural Met1 has also been found for many other E. coli recombinant DNA enzymes. The AP site in DNA exists as an equilibrium mixture of the open-chain aldehyde, the α- and β-hemiacetals, and the open-chain hydrate. Although open-chain aldehydes constitute a very small percentage of total AP sites, they are subject to β-elimination at higher temperatures and in the presence of a variety of agents including common buffers (8Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 135-190Google Scholar, 9Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Google Scholar, 20Bailly V. Verly W.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 761-768Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, form III). The β-elimination product itself can be further shortened to the β,δ-elimination product if strong base is also present during heat exposure (Fig. 1, form II). β-Elimination is prevented, however, by NaBH4 reduction of the open aldehyde to deoxyribitol. Beginning with a 49-bp oligodeoxynucleotide substrate, we examined various potential phosphodiester backbone cleavage products. Fig. 2A illustrates the difference in electrophoretic mobility of the form III β-elimination cleavage product created by treating the unstabilized 49-bp abasic site-containing substrate molecule at 700C (lane 10), the form II product created by treatment with both heat and base (lane 9), and the enzymatically generated form I 20-mer with a free 3ʹ-hydroxyl group at its terminus (lanes 6-8). Heat treatment of the stabilized substrate did not alter the substrate (lane 12), while treatment of the stabilized 49-bp abasic site-containing substrate with both heat and strong base resulted in a product with mobility of form I 20-mer containing the 3ʹ-hydroxyl group at its terminus (lane 11). This latter product has been proposed to involve a 3ʹ,5ʹ cyclization intermediate (21Bayley C.R. Brammer K.W. Jones A.S. J. Chem. Soc. 1961; : 1903-1907Google Scholar). Comparison of human AP endo activity with substrates generated in the presence or absence of NaBH4 is also shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 1-8). The rate of the cleavage reaction was faster with the stabilized substrate, and products other than the anticipated form I 20-mer were not detected (Fig. 2). While the absence of undesired spontaneous β-elimination products was not a surprise for the NaBH4-treated substrate, an enhancement of the catalytic rate was unexpected. With the stabilized substrate, formation of form I product was linear for 60 s at an enzyme concentration of 0.02 nM. The apparent Km and kcat were 100 nM and 10 s-1, respectively (Fig. 3A and Table I). Enzyme activity required divalent cation (Mg2+) and was completely blocked by 4 mM EDTA in the absence of added Mg2+.Table I.Comparison of observed and calculated steady-state kinetic parameters for human AP endonuclease cleavage of a 49-base pair oligonucleotide with a single abasic siteSteady-state kinetic parameterKmkcatkcat/KmnMs-1M-1 s-1Observed valueaTaken from Fig. 3A.100101.0 × 108Calculated valuebAssuming the mechanism depicted in Scheme I, Km = (koff+ kcat)/kon, where k2 is equivalent to kcat.

Open table in a new tab To understand the observed rate enhancement with the stabilized substrate, the spontaneous β-elimination product (Fig. 1, form III) was deliberately generated by heating unstabilized substrate without enzyme for 30 min at 700C. When this HDP was included in the reaction mix, it proved to be an inhibitor of AP endo activity (Fig. 3). When inhibition was studied as a function of stabilized substrate concentration, HDP increased the apparent Km for stabilized substrate without markedly altering Vmax (i.e. ordinate-intercept; Fig. 3A). From Dixon analysis of the inhibition, the Ki for this competitive inhibitor was 30 nM (Fig. 3B). Thus the enhancement of AP endo activity for reactions in which the abasic site DNA substrate was stabilized by NaBH4 reduction was probably due to the absence of spontaneously generated HDP, which could have accumulated in the reaction mixture. This proposal is consistent with the degree of inhibition observed with spontaneously generated HDP (80%, Fig. 2B) and that determined here with deliberately generated HDP (Fig. 3), where inhibition under the conditions described in Fig. 2 would be expected to be 60%. To assign the stoichiometry of binding of AP endo and DNA, we used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to measure the relative amount of enzyme-DNA complex formed at various enzyme/DNA ratios (Fig. 4). There is more complex formed with an abasic site-containing oligomer than with a double-stranded oligomer without an abasic site, indicating that binding to substrate or nicked DNA was much tighter than binding to “intact” double-stranded DNA. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for the “abasic site” DNA was less than 0.1 nM. The enzyme concentration saturating the abasic site-containing DNA corresponded to a molecular ratio of 1 enzyme to 1 DNA molecule (Fig. 4B). To delineate the individual components of substrate DNA binding that are embedded within the Michaelis constant (Km), we measured substrate association and dissociation with AP endo by using a challenger to trap free enzyme, in order to estimate the concentration of enzyme-substrate complex. In the presence of challenger, enzyme that is bound productively to substrate can nick DNA, whereas free enzyme is quenched. Thus, activity is proportional to the concentration of ES complex. Various agents including single-stranded DNA, oligo(dT), higher concentrations of unlabeled abasic site-containing substrate, heparin, and HDP were evaluated for their ability to trap free enzyme and prevent catalytic cycling. An effective trap should quench catalytic cycling when preincubated with enzyme and substrate. Single-stranded DNA, oligo(dT), and unlabeled abasic site-containing substrate were ineffective traps. Unlabeled abasic site-containing substrate probably was not a good trapping agent, since it is an excellent substrate for human AP endonuclease as suggested by the high turnover number and low Km. Accordingly, attempts to use unlabeled substrate resulted in depletion of both labeled and unlabeled substrate at the concentration of enzyme used to perform single-turnover experiments. However, of particular interest were the results with HDP and heparin. HDP or heparin alone were ineffective in completely preventing cycling of the enzyme. However, in the presence of both heparin and HDP, the enzyme was prevented from catalytic cycling over a 10-s interval (data not shown). In addition, the amount of product formed per catalytic cycle was directly proportional to enzyme concentration. Thus, the combination of heparin and HDP effectively competes for substrate binding without being “consumed,” making this mixture a better trap than unlabeled substrate. The association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants for the AP endo-substrate interaction were determined by examining the time dependence of ES formation by employing the challenge assay as described above. To follow ES formation, enzyme and substrate were incubated under pseudo-first order conditions in the absence of Mg2+ for periods up to 30 s (Fig. 5). For each period, the amount of ES complex was measured by initiating enzymatic activity with Mg2+ and trap. Substrate was able to bind to AP endo in a concentration-dependent manner in the absence of Mg2+. The apparent half-time (t1/2) for enzyme and DNA association was 7.4 and 2.9 s for 0.1 nM and 0.4 nM enzyme, respectively, where t1/2 is ln 2/kobs. Assuming a simple binding model (E + S ⇄ ES), these half-times correspond to an apparent association rate constant of 5 × 107M-1 s-1 and suggest that the dissociation rate constant is very slow (koff≈ 0.04 s-1). The corresponding equilibrium dissociation constant is, therefore, 0.8 nM. Longer incubations (i.e. 5 min) with several enzyme and substrate concentrations (1-10 nM) resulted in an equilibrium level of complex formation consistent with this dissociation constant. This equilibrium constant is larger than that determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3). Therefore, the equilibrium constant determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay appeared to substantially overestimate DNA binding affinity. When product release is slower than chemistry, the time course of product formation is biphasic. There is an initial burst of product formation equivalent to the active enzyme fraction, followed by a linear phase that represents slow product dissociation. However, the rapid consumption of substrate in the presence of high enzyme concentrations precluded accurate estimates of product formation at times accessible by manual mixing and sampling techniques. Results of Wilson et al. (22Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Google Scholar) suggest that chemistry of the enzymatic reaction is itself rate-limiting. In their study, the presence of a 5ʹ-phosphorothioate derivative at the scissile bond phosphate substantially reduced the rate of the enzymatic reaction, an observation that is consistent with an elemental effect on the nicking reaction. These results indicate that chemical cleavage or a conformational change prior to nicking is rate-limiting, instead of a subsequent step such as product release. If steps occurring after chemistry are so rapid that they are not rate-limiting, the ratio of kcat/Km is a measure of the apparent second order rate constant for productive substrate binding. In keeping with this idea, it is noted that the values for kcat/Km and the association rate constant for AP endo are comparable (Table I). Additionally, kinetic simulation of substrate binding from these steady-state measurements (Fig. 5, dotted lines), assuming an irreversible binding reaction, demonstrate that there is good agreement with the binding time courses determined by the challenge assay (Fig. 5, solid lines). The amplitude of the simulated time courses is reduced to that observed for the time courses of complex formation determined with a trapping agent, if a dissociation rate constant of 0.10 s-1 is included (data not shown). The results described above can be used to derive a minimal kinetic scheme consistent with a Briggs-Haldane mechanism (Scheme I). Additionally, steady-state kinetic parameters can be calculated or derived from simulation of the model depicted in Scheme I for comparison to observed values (Table I). In this scheme, product release (i.e. k3) is assumed to be rapid since a phosphorothioelemental effect has been reported (22Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Google Scholar), and kcat reflects the chemical step (i.e. k2). In this study, we used steady-state and transient-state kinetic parameters to describe human AP endo enzymatic nicking of a synthetic oligomer with a single abasic site. This study was facilitated by the observation that the spontaneous heat degradation product of abasic site-containing DNA inhibits the enzyme competitively. The minimal mechanism proposed is a simple Briggs-Haldane scheme, where the forward catalytic reaction competes with the dissociation of the enzyme-DNA complex. This kinetic mechanism is a prerequisite for studies of the kinetic properties of mutant or altered enzyme forms and will facilitate identification of chemotherapeutic agents designed to inhibit DNA repair. Definitive evidence is lacking that AP endo participates in base excision repair. However, since the turnover number for DNA polymerase β, known to be integral in the single-nucleotide base excision repair pathway (13Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kühn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Google Scholar), is approximately 1 s-1 (23Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Google Scholar, 24Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12141-12144Google Scholar), AP endo would not be rate-limiting if operating under optimal conditions. It remains to be determined if human AP endo enzyme activity can be modulated in vivo and if this will translate to altered sensitivity to DNA damaging agents repaired by base excision repair. We thank Dr. Veronique Bailly and Katherine Latham for helpful discussions regarding stabilization of the abasic site."

This 125-kDa glycoprotein contains a peptide sequence identified as the catalytic site in type I alkaline phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and it possesses 5′-nucleotide PDE (EC 3.1.4.1) activity (Stracke, M.

A., Sobel, M. E., Liotta, L. A., and Stracke, M. L. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 30479-30484). ATX binds ATP and is phosphorylated only on threonine. Thr210 at the PDE active site of ATX is required for phosphorylation, 5′-nucleotide PDE, and motility-stimulating activities (Lee, H. Y., Clair, T., Mulvaney, P. T., Woodhouse, E. C., Aznavoorian, S., Liotta, L. A., and Stracke, M. L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 24408-24412). In this article we report that the phosphorylation of ATX is a transient event, being stable at 0°C but unstable at 37°C, and that ATX has adenosine-5′-triphosphatase (ATPase; EC 3.6.1.3) and ATP pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.8) activities. Thus ATX catalyzes the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond on either side of the β-phosphate of ATP. ATX also catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and GMP, of either AMP or PPi to Pi, and the hydrolysis of NAD to AMP, and each of these substrates can serve as a phosphate donor in the phosphorylation of ATX. ATX possesses no detectable protein kinase activity toward histone, myelin basic protein, or casein. These results lead to the proposal that ATX is capable of at least two alternative reaction mechanisms, threonine (T-type) ATPase and 5′-nucleotide PDE/ATP pyrophosphatase, with a common site (Thr210) for the formation of covalently bound reaction intermediates threonine phosphate and threonine adenylate, respectively.

Chem. 1985; 260: 8320-8324Google Scholar) and extensive homology with the ectoprotein PC-1 (5Buckley M.F. Loveland K.A. McKinstry W.J. Garson O.M. Goding J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17506-17511Google Scholar), the brain-type PDE I-nucleotide pyrophosphatase gene 2 (6Kawagoe H. Soma O. Goji J. Nishimura N. Narita M. Inazawa J. Nakamura H. Sano K. Genomics. 1995; 30: 380-384Google Scholar), and the rat neural differentiation antigen gp130RB13-6 (7Deissler H. Lottspeich F. Rajewsky M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9849-9855Google Scholar). ATX contains two tandem somatomedin B regions, the loop region of an EF-hand and a type I PDE catalytic site, and possesses 5′-nucleotide PDE activity (2Murata J. Lee H.Y. Clair T. Krutsch H.C. Årestad A.A. Sobel M.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30479-30484Google Scholar).Early studies on digestive enzymes responsible for RNA degradation identified a class of enzymes characterized by their reaction product, a 5′-monophosphate nucleotide, and their activity toward p-nitrophenyl-thymidine monophosphate (Φ-TMP) (8Razzell W.E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2105-2113Google Scholar). This type I PDE activity has also been detected in a variety of mammalian tissues, their plasma membranes, and cell surfaces (9Decker K. Bischoff E. FEBS Lett. 1971; 21: 95-98Google Scholar, 10Evans W.H. Hood D.O. Gurd J.W. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 819-826Google Scholar, 11Morley D.J. Hawley D.M. Ulbright T.M. Butler L.G. Culp J.S. Hodes M.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 75-82Google Scholar). The unifying features of these activities, in addition to the reaction product, are the broad specificity for substrates and competitive inhibitors, the alkaline pH optimum, and the ability to hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond between the α- and β-phosphates in nucleoside polyphosphates. ATX possesses type I PDE activity and also induces a known biological response, the potent stimulation of cellular locomotion; thus it is possible to investigate the role of this enzyme reaction center in extracellular signal transduction.The reaction mechanism for type I PDE has been described as involving formation of nucleotidylated threonine as a covalently bound reaction intermediate (4Culp J.S. Blytt H.J. Hermodson M. Butler L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8320-8324Google Scholar), and PC-1 can be autophosphorylated on this threonine at the PDE catalytic center using [γ-32P]ATP (12Oda Y. Kuo M.-D. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27318-27326Google Scholar). Previous studies from this laboratory on ATX with point mutations at the PDE active site showed that the corresponding threonine in ATX (Thr210) is required for its chemotactic, 5′-nucleotide PDE and threonine phosphorylation activities, and that phosphorylation-deficient, 5′-nucleotide PDE-competent ATX (K209L) is fully active in the stimulation of cellular motility (3Lee H.Y. Clair T. Mulvaney P.T. Woodhouse E.C. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24408-24412Google Scholar). These findings suggested that the dephosphorylated state of ATX is a biologically active form and prompted us to investigate the relationship between the phosphorylation state and the catalytic properties of ATX. These earlier studies had also shown that phospho-ATX contains the γ- and not the α-phosphate from ATP but addressed neither the stability of this construct nor the fate of the β-phosphate. In addition, unanswered questions remained concerning the nucleotide reaction products, the ability of ATX to use substrates other than ATP, and the possibility that the phosphorylation of ATX was due to the presence of a co-purifying protein kinase. We have resolved these issues by characterizing the enzymatic activities of ATX using homogeneously pure recombinant ATX (rATX) derived from the human teratocarcinoma cell line N-tera2D1 (13Lee H.Y. Murata J. Clair T. Polymeropoulos M.H. Torres R. Manrow R. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 714-719Google Scholar) and partially purified ATX (A2058 ATX) from A2058 human melanoma cells.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have shown that homogeneously pure rATX catalyzes 5′-nucleotide PDE activity (Fig. 1) under physiological conditions and is indistinguishable from A2058 ATX (purified from a human melanoma cell line), based on the kinetics of threonine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). In addition we have shown that, with ATP as a substrate, ATX has ATPase (producing ADP and Pi) and ATP pyrophosphatase (producing AMP and PPi) activities (Fig. 4).Since both the 5′-nucleotide PDE and ATP pyrophosphatase activities of ATX hydrolyze the α-β phosphodiester bond in their respective nucleotide substrates, it is probable that these two activities result from the same reaction mechanism. ATX is labeled by either [32P](adenylate) NAD or [32P]AMP (this report) but not by [α-32P] ATP (3; data not shown). It is possible that ATX preferentially hydrolyzes, and incorporates phosphate from, the highest energy phosphoester bond in the substrate, which, in the case of ATP, is the β-γ phosphodiester bond. Such a preference would also explain the observations that ATP and ϕ-TMP are comparable in their ability to compete for the noncovalent binding of [α-32P]8-N3-ATP to ATX (Fig. 5A), but that ATP is effective at much lower concentrations than ϕ-TMP in inhibiting phosphorylation of ATX by [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 5B). Consistent with this possibility is the observation (Fig. 5C) that ATP derivatives that lack a hydrolyzable bond at the β-γ position (AMP-CP and AMP-PCP) are less effective as inhibitors of the ATX-catalyzed 5′-nucleotide PDE reaction than derivatives that contain a hydrolyzable bond at this position (AMP-CPP and ATP). The interesting suggestion (17Uriarte M. Stalmans W. Hickman S. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 271-277Google Scholar) that there may be competition between the phosphorylation and phosphodiesterase activities of PC-1 may be relevant to these unresolved questions regarding ATX. The simplest interpretation of the competition between substrates for ATP binding, 5′-nucleotide PDE, and phosphorylation (Fig. 5) is that a single nucleotide binding site is used by ATX for each of these enzymatic functions, but definitive resolution of this question awaits more extensive enzyme inhibition and nucleotide binding studies.GTP, NAD, AMP, and PPi are susceptible to hydrolysis by ATX and serve as phosphate donors in its phosphorylation. The hydrolysis of PPi to Pi occurs in a number of intracellular energy-conserving reactions (18Reeves R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1976; 1: 53-55Google Scholar), but the relationship between these reactions and the inorganic pyrophosphatase activity of ATX is not clear. The predominant products of ATP hydrolysis by ATX in vitro are ADP and Pi, but the substrates and products of in vivo catalysis by ATX in the stimulation of tumor cell motility are not known. With the ability to hydrolyze nucleoside polyphosphates at a variety of positions, ATX may catalyze nucleotidase cascades (19Pearson J.D. Carleton J.S. Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 421-429Google Scholar, 20Trams E.G. J. Theor. Biol. 1980; 87: 609-621Google Scholar). ATX hydrolyzes substrates other than ATP, and the facility with which these substrates phosphorylate ATX suggests that in catalyzing each of the various hydrolytic reactions, ATX uses a covalently bound, phosphate-containing reaction intermediate. The data presented in this article strongly suggest that this is indeed the case for the ATPase reaction catalyzed by ATX. Fig. 6 depicts a proposed model for the formation of covalently bound reaction intermediates in the catalytic action of ATX toward ATP. ATX is proposed to be capable of at least two alternative mechanisms, ATPase and 5′-nucleotide PDE/ATP pyrophosphatase, each of which uses Thr210 as the site for the formation of the covalently bound reaction intermediate. The phosphothreonine intermediate in the ATPase reaction mechanism (Fig. 6, reaction 1) contains only the γ-phosphate from ATP and is stable at 0°C and unstable at 37°C (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). The depicted formation of the adenylyl threonine intermediate (Fig. 6, reaction 2) is based on the reported mechanism for 5′-nucleotide PDE (4Culp J.S. Blytt H.J. Hermodson M. Butler L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8320-8324Google Scholar). According to this proposal the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of ATX is a integral part of the ATPase reaction mechanism, and ATX is atypical among known ATPases (21Pedersen P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 146-150Google Scholar, 22Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Google Scholar) in that it uses a phosphorylated threonine as a covalently bound reaction intermediate. Unequivocal demonstration of the identity of the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of ATX with its ATPase activity awaits analysis in progress designed to show that a single point mutation simultaneously abolishes both of these activities. This mutational analysis is also being used to investigate the possibility that the same relationship holds between the other phosphorylation substrates and their hydrolysis by ATX.Among the proteins with sequence homology to ATX the most well characterized is the ectoprotein PC-1. ATX and PC-1 each contain two tandem somatomedin B regions, the loop region of an EF-hand, and a type I PDE catalytic site and possess 5′-nucleotide PDE activity (2Murata J. Lee H.Y. Clair T. Krutsch H.C. Årestad A.A. Sobel M.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30479-30484Google Scholar, 23Rebbe N.F. Tong B.D. Finley E.M. Hickman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5192-5196Google Scholar). Studies on the effect of pH on the PDE activity of PC-1 (12Oda Y. Kuo M.-D. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27318-27326Google Scholar), assayed at a substrate (ϕ-TMP) concentration of 0.5 mM, show optimum activity at alkaline pH, a characteristic that is typical of type I PDE enzymes. The 5′-nucleotide PDE activity of ATX at submillimolar substrate concentrations (Fig. 1) does not show this preference for alkaline pH. These data suggest that ATX and PC-1 may differ in this respect, and that catalysis of the 5′-nucleotide PDE reaction by ATX is physiologically relevant. [α-32P]ATP has been reported to label purified PC-1 (threonine at the PDE active site) (12Oda Y. Kuo M.-D. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27318-27326Google Scholar) as well as immunoprecipitated or cell surface PC-1 (24Belli S.I. Mercuri F.A. Sali A. Goding J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 669-676Google Scholar). Attempts to label ATX with [α-32P]ATP have been unsuccessful (3; data not shown). It is possible that adenylyl ATX, formed during incubation of ATP with ATX, exists only as a short-lived 5′-nucleotide PDE/ATP pyrophosphatase reaction intermediate and that its extremely transient nature precludes detection under the conditions and quantities of ATX used. Such a characteristic would also explain the efficiency of this ATX-catalyzed reaction at physiological pH, a property previously unreported among the type I PDE enzymes. The dephosphorylation of phospho-ATX also differs from that of PC-1 in that it occurs after dialysis to remove exogenous nucleotides, which are reported to be stimulatory and necessary for the dephosphorylation of phospho-PC-1 (17Uriarte M. Stalmans W. Hickman S. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 271-277Google Scholar).This and other distinctions in the enzymatic characteristics between PC-1 and ATX may arise, at least in part, from a difference in the sequence of the nucleotide binding site. PC-1 (5Buckley M.F. Loveland K.A. McKinstry W.J. Garson O.M. Goding J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17506-17511Google Scholar) contains the glycine-rich GXGXXG sequence found in nucleotide-binding proteins (25Schulz G.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 61-67Google Scholar) along with the downstream lysine invariably found in protein kinases (26Bossemeyer D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Google Scholar), and this region may serve as an ATP binding site. Although ATX (2Murata J. Lee H.Y. Clair T. Krutsch H.C. Årestad A.A. Sobel M.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30479-30484Google Scholar) has extensive homology to PC-1, it does not contain this sequence, nor does ATX contain a perfect match to any of the other P-loop type sequences found in adenine and guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (27Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Google Scholar). Although the nature of the ATP binding site(s) in PDE enzymes is not yet defined, ATP clearly binds to ATX (3; this report), and both PC-1 (28Maddux B.A. Sbraccia P. Kumakura S. Sasson S. Youngren J. Fisher A. Spencer S. Grupe A. Henzel W. Stewart T.A. Reaven G.M. Goldfine I.D. Nature. 1995; 373: 448-451Google Scholar) and ATX (3; this report) have been purified to homogeneity using ATP-agarose chromatography. The failure to detect protein kinase activity in ATX is not unexpected considering the lack of sequence similarity to known protein kinases.The discovery of the heterotrimeric G-proteins and the nature of their interaction with adenylyl cyclase (29Gilman A. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 65-97Google Scholar) revealed a mechanism by which intracellular enzyme catalysis participates in signal transduction, but such a role for extracellular enzyme activity has not been established. Human angiogenin has been reported to have both RNase and angiogenic activities (30Shapiro R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3527-3532Google Scholar); the thymidine phosphorylase activity of platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor may be responsible for its chemotactic activity (31Haraguchi M. Miyadera K. Uemura K. Sumizawa T. Furukawa T. Yamada K. Akiyama S. Nature. 1994; 368: 198Google Scholar); antibodies directed against alkaline phosphatase activity have been shown to inhibit cell migration during development of the axolotl pronephric duct (32Drawbridge J. Scherson T. Erdman J.E. Basaviah P. Steinberg M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 145aGoogle Scholar); and the pertussis toxin-sensitive stimulation of tumor cell motility by ATX requires an intact 5′-nucleotide PDE reaction site (3Lee H.Y. Clair T.

Together these observations suggest that extracellular enzyme catalysis may also have a role in transmembrane signaling.Extracellular nucleosides and nucleotides participate in a variety of biological processes, including signal transduction through purinoreceptors (33Stiles G.

Chem. 1983; 258: 4345-4349Google Scholar). Extracellular nucleotidases such as ATX may serve to deplete ATP and/or ADP as a cytoprotective mechanism (45Suprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Google Scholar) or to terminate P2 purinoreceptor-mediated signals (34Chen Z.-P. Levy A. Lightman S.L. J. of Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 7: 83-96Google Scholar). Also, enzyme catalysis by ATX may provide AMP and/or adenosine to initiate P1 purinoreceptor-mediated signals (33Stiles G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6451-6454Google Scholar), or it may participate in salvage pathways by facilitating the capture and reuptake of nucleosides (46Che M. Nishida T. Gatmaitan Z. Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9684-9688Google Scholar). Cell adhesion molecule 105 has been identified as an ecto-ATPase with implications for cell-cell interaction (47Aurivillius M. Hansen O.C. Lazrek M.B.S. Bock E. Öbrink B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 267-269Google Scholar), and a rat liver ecto-ATPase has been identified as a canalicular bile acid transport protein (48Sippel C.J. Suchy F.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2083-2091Google Scholar). Since phosphorylation-deficient ATX (K209L) is biologically active (3Lee H.Y. Clair T. Mulvaney P.T. Woodhouse E.C. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24408-24412Google Scholar), the ATPase activity of ATX may be dispensable for the stimulation of cellular motility. On the other hand, the stability of phospho-ATX in vivo is unknown, and since the dephospho form of ATX is apparently an active state, the possibility of a regulatory role for the phosphorylation of ATX is not excluded.Continuing investigations on autotaxin are designed to test the hypothesis that the phosphorylated forms of ATX are enzyme-bound reaction intermediates in the hydrolysis of phosphoester bonds and to study the relationship between the 5′-nucleotide PDE/ATP pyrophosphatase activity of ATX and its stimulation of cellular motility, as well as the influence of the phosphorylation state and ATPase activities on these properties of ATX.

ATX contains two tandem somatomedin B regions, the loop region of an EF-hand and a type I PDE catalytic site, and possesses 5′-nucleotide PDE activity (2Murata J. Lee H.Y. Clair T. Krutsch H.C. Årestad A.A. Sobel M.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30479-30484Google Scholar).Early studies on digestive enzymes responsible for RNA degradation identified a class of enzymes characterized by their reaction product, a 5′-monophosphate nucleotide, and their activity toward p-nitrophenyl-thymidine monophosphate (Φ-TMP) (8Razzell W.E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2105-2113Google Scholar). This type I PDE activity has also been detected in a variety of mammalian tissues, their plasma membranes, and cell surfaces (9Decker K. Bischoff E. FEBS Lett. 1971; 21: 95-98Google Scholar, 10Evans W.H. Hood D.O. Gurd J.W. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 819-826Google Scholar, 11Morley D.J. Hawley D.M. Ulbright T.M. Butler L.G. Culp J.S. Hodes M.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 75-82Google Scholar). The unifying features of these activities, in addition to the reaction product, are the broad specificity for substrates and competitive inhibitors, the alkaline pH optimum, and the ability to hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond between the α- and β-phosphates in nucleoside polyphosphates. ATX possesses type I PDE activity and also induces a known biological response, the potent stimulation of cellular locomotion; thus it is possible to investigate the role of this enzyme reaction center in extracellular signal transduction.The reaction mechanism for type I PDE has been described as involving formation of nucleotidylated threonine as a covalently bound reaction intermediate (4Culp J.S. Blytt H.J. Hermodson M. Butler L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8320-8324Google Scholar), and PC-1 can be autophosphorylated on this threonine at the PDE catalytic center using [γ-32P]ATP (12Oda Y. Kuo M.-D. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27318-27326Google Scholar). Previous studies from this laboratory on ATX with point mutations at the PDE active site showed that the corresponding threonine in ATX (Thr210) is required for its chemotactic, 5′-nucleotide PDE and threonine phosphorylation activities, and that phosphorylation-deficient, 5′-nucleotide PDE-competent ATX (K209L) is fully active in the stimulation of cellular motility (3Lee H.Y. Clair T. Mulvaney P.T. Woodhouse E.C. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24408-24412Google Scholar). These findings suggested that the dephosphorylated state of ATX is a biologically active form and prompted us to investigate the relationship between the phosphorylation state and the catalytic properties of ATX. These earlier studies had also shown that phospho-ATX contains the γ- and not the α-phosphate from ATP but addressed neither the stability of this construct nor the fate of the β-phosphate. In addition, unanswered questions remained concerning the nucleotide reaction products, the ability of ATX to use substrates other than ATP, and the possibility that the phosphorylation of ATX was due to the presence of a co-purifying protein kinase. We have resolved these issues by characterizing the enzymatic activities of ATX using homogeneously pure recombinant ATX (rATX) derived from the human teratocarcinoma cell line N-tera2D1 (13Lee H.Y.

Calcium binding to this type of motif has been demonstrated with blood clotting factors IX and X (18Persson E. Selander M. Linse S. Drakenberg T. Öhlin A.-K. Stenflo J. J. Biol.

It has been suggested that calcium binding to cbEGF-like motifs mediates protein-protein interactions. For example, mutations of amino acid residues crucial for calcium binding affect the clotting activity of factor IX (25Rees D.J.G. Jones I.M. Handford P.A. Walter S.J. Esnouf M.P. Smith K.J. Brownlee G.G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2053-2061Google Scholar). The interaction of Protein S with complement C4b-binding protein is mediated by this type of module (26Dahlbäck B. Frohm B. Nelsestuen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16082-16087Google Scholar), and the interaction of the Drosophila transmembrane protein Notch with Delta and Serrate depends on two tandemly repeated cbEGF-like motifs (27Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1991; 67: 687-699Google Scholar). Possibly, cbEGF-like motifs are also involved in mediating the calcium-dependent interaction of fibrillin-1 with fibulin-2 (28Reinhardt D.P. Sasaki T. Dzamba B.J. Keene D.R. Chu M.-L. Göhring W. Timpl R. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19489-19496Google Scholar).The fibrillin family consists of two members, fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, both of which are integral constituents of the 10-12-nm diameter extracellular matrix microfibrils (5Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D. Hu W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Google Scholar, 29Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Google Scholar). Both proteins consist of repetitive motifs: 47 of them are EGF-like repeats, and 43 have the consensus sequence for calcium binding. The cbEGF-like repeats are dispersed over both entire molecules in nine stretches of 1-12 tandemly repeated motifs.Mutations in fibrillin-1 result in Marfan's syndrome, a connective tissue disorder affecting the cardiovascular, skeletal, and ocular systems (reviewed in 30Dietz H.C. Pyeritz R.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1799-1809Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutations in fibrillin-2 give rise to congenital contractural arachnodactyly, a disorder characterized primarily by joint contractures and other skeletal features (31Putnam E.A. Zhang H. Ramirez F. Milewicz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 456-458Google Scholar). Most of the more than 50 known mutations in fibrillin-1 and the two mutations in fibrillin-2 occur in cbEGF-like repeats and are predicted to disturb calcium binding, suggesting an important role of the cbEGF-like repeats in these proteins.In this study, we investigated the effect of calcium binding on the stability of fibrillin-1 in protease degradation assays. These results demonstrate that calcium stabilizes fibrillin-1 against proteolytic degradation. This may be a general functional aspect for cbEGF-like motifs in other proteins. We hypothesize that mutations in fibrillin-1, and possibly in other proteins, that disturb calcium binding to cbEGF-like motifs render the molecules more susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Progressive degradation of the molecules or their assembly products could thus lead to the pathology of the disease.RESULTSThe experiments described were designed to study the functional contribution of calcium binding to cbEGF-like motifs. Since the fibrillins, a family of large extracellular matrix proteins, contain multiple (43Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Google Scholar) cbEGF-like repeats in tandem arrays, we used fibrillin-1 as a prototype protein for our investigations.To isolate fibrillin-1 from cell culture sources, confluent normal skin fibroblasts were labeled with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine for 48 h. To reduce the background, fibronectin was depleted from the radiolabeled cell culture medium by gelatin-Sepharose. Finally, fibrillin-1 was purified from the medium by affinity chromatography on mAb 26, which is specific for fibrillin-1. 2D. R. Keene, C. D. Jordan, D. P. Reinhardt, C. C. Ridgway, R. N. Ono, G. M. Corson, M. Fairhurst, M. D. Sussman, V. A. Memoli, and L. Y. Sakai, submitted for publication. Incubation of radiolabeled fibrillin-1 with trypsin in the presence of 5 mM CaCl2 or 5 mM EDTA resulted in significantly slower degradation with calcium, demonstrating that calcium stabilizes fibrillin-1 and protects the molecule against proteolysis (Fig. 1a). Already, after an incubation time of 10 min, fibrillin-1 was strongly degraded in the presence of EDTA. On the other hand, bovine serum albumin, a disulfide-bonded non-calcium-binding plasma protein, showed faster degradation in the presence of calcium as compared with EDTA (Fig. 1b), which is probably due to the stabilizing effect of calcium on trypsin (36Bulaj G. Otlewski J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 701-716Google Scholar). Thus, the differences observed in fibrillin-1 degradation in the presence of calcium and EDTA may even be underestimated. Also, the considerably slower degradation of serum albumin in the presence of calcium or EDTA indicates that the extended thread-like shaped fibrillin-1 molecule (37Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14763-14770Google Scholar) is much more susceptible to degradation than the globular shaped serum albumin.Recently, we demonstrated correct structural and functional properties of recombinantly expressed subdomains of fibrillin-1 (24Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Google Scholar, 28Reinhardt D.P. Sasaki T. Dzamba B.J. Keene D.R. Chu M.-L. Göhring W. Timpl R. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19489-19496Google Scholar). To extend the studies described above, we used recombinant subdomains rF6 and rF11, which span the whole fibrillin-1 molecule, for protease degradation assays with different proteases (Fig. 2). Consistently, with trypsin, chymotrypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, and elastase, rF11 (the N-terminal half) and rF6 (the C-terminal half) were stabilized and protected against proteolysis in the presence of calcium versus EDTA. Often, the subdomains were completely digested after 23 h of incubation in the presence of EDTA, whereas in the presence of calcium, the subdomains remained relatively intact. These data indicate that essentially all types of amino acid residues (basic, acidic, and hydrophobic) within the fibrillin-1 molecule are more susceptible to proteolytic attack in the absence of calcium. Control experiments (data not shown) with bovine serum albumin, as described above, showed slightly higher activities for α-chymotrypsin and elastase in the presence of calcium. For endoproteinase Glu-C, degradation patterns were identical or only slightly enhanced in the presence of EDTA.Fig. 2Influence of calcium on the protease susceptibility of recombinant subdomains of fibrillin-1. Aliquots (20 μl, 0.7 mg/ml) of recombinant subdomains rF11 (upper panel) and rF6 (lower panel) were incubated in the presence of 5 mM CaCl2 (lanes a) or 5 mM EDTA (lanes b) with trypsin (Try), α-chymotrypsin (Chy), endoproteinase Glu-C (SV8), or elastase from porcine pancreas (Ela) at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) at 37°C for the time periods as indicated. Termination of the reactions was performed as described in the legend of Fig. 1. The samples were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis (7.5% (w/v) acrylamide) and Coomassie Blue staining. The positions of globular marker proteins (in kilodaltons) are indicated. This experiment was repeated with identical results, and similar experiments further substantiated these results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To obtain sequence information about protease cleavage sites, which are usually protected by calcium, we recombinantly produced the longest stretch of 12 tandemly repeated cbEGF-like motifs preceded by the third 8-cysteine motif in fibrillin-1 for calcium protection assays. This recombinant subdomain (rF17; Fig. 3) was secreted by episomally transfected human 293 cells in amounts of 10 μg/ml/day. Edman degradation and amino acid analysis of rF17 were as expected from the cDNA. The electrophoretic mobility on SDS gels was somewhat slower than calculated. Treatment of rF17 with N-glycanase prior to SDS gel electrophoresis reduced its apparent molecular mass by ∼10%, indicating that most, if not all, of the five potential N-glycosylation sites present in rF17 are occupied by N-linked glycosyl chains. Similar observations with rF6, rF11, and other recombinant fibrillin-1 subdomains were reported previously (24Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J.

Rotary shadowing of rF17 (data not shown) demonstrated extended thread-like particles similar to regions in fibrillin previously isolated from cell cultures (37Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14763-14770Google Scholar).Fig. 3Schematic graph of recombinant subdomain rF17 as compared with full-length fibrillin-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Incubation of subdomain rF17 with trypsin or endoproteinase Glu-C at various incubation times in the presence of CaCl2 or EDTA demonstrated again the protective nature of calcium when bound to fibrillin-1 (Fig. 4). SDS gel electrophoresis of protease-treated rF17 under nonreducing conditions often resulted in one band corresponding to full-length rF17 (data not shown). These data demonstrate that most of the cleavage sites are located within disulfide-bonded loops and not between neighboring cbEGF-like repeats, which are not connected by disulfide bridges.Fig. 4Analysis of proteolytic cleavage sites that are protected by calcium. Recombinant subdomain rF17 (1.1 mg/ml in a and 1.3 mg/ml in b) was incubated for 5 min with trypsin (enzyme/substrate ration = 1:80 (w/w)) (a) or for 30 min with endoproteinase Glu-C (SV8; enzyme/substrate ratio = 1:100 (w/w)) (b) at 37°C in the presence of 5 mM CaCl2 (Ca) or 5 mM EDTA (E). Aliquots (7.5 μl) were separated under reducing conditions by SDS gel electrophoresis (11% (w/v) acrylamide) and then stained with Coomassie Blue. The experiments were repeated with identical results. Additional experiments with extended incubation times further confirmed these results. In a second experiment, the degradation products were transferred after SDS gel electrophoresis to Immobilon-P, and individual bands were analyzed by Edman degradation. N-terminal sequences of the degradation products and the positions of globular marker proteins (in kilodaltons) are indicated. The positions of the labile sites identified are demonstrated in Fig. 5 schematically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The major protein bands obtained after a short (5-30 min) digest with trypsin or endoproteinase Glu-C in the presence of EDTA were analyzed by Edman degradation (Fig. 4). Protease-sensitive sites, which are protected by calcium, were determined in cbEGF-like repeat 11 (Met1034 and Asn1046), repeat 12 (Ser1103), and repeat 17 (Thr1318) and in the C-terminal part of the third 8-cysteine motif (Ile1019). Met1034 and Asn1046 originate from the regions between cysteines 1 and 2 and between cysteines 3 and 4 of cbEGF-like motif 11, respectively. These regions are close to the calcium-binding pocket (Fig. 5) (38Selander-Sunnerhagen M. Ullner M. Persson E. Teleman O. Stenflo J. Drakenberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19642-19649Google Scholar, 39Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Google Scholar). The other labile sites originate from the last loop between cysteines 5 and 6 of cbEGF-like repeat 12 (Ser1103) and repeat 17 (Thr1318) or from the interdomain region between the third 8-cysteine motif and cbEGF-like repeat 11 (Ile1019). These regions are some distance away from the calcium-binding pocket (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Mapping of calcium-protected labile sites onto cbEGF-like repeats of fibrillin-1. cbEGF-like repeats 11, 12, and 17 are indicated.

Chalberg S.C. Dietz H.C. Charbonneau N.L. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 476-484Google Scholar), with pepsin fragments of microfibrils (22Glanville R.W. Qian R.-Q. McClure D.W. Maslen C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26630-26634Google Scholar), with recombinant subdomains of fibrillin-1 (24Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Google Scholar, 40Knott V. Downing D.K. Cardy C.M. Handford P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 22-27Google Scholar), and with synthetic peptides (23Handford P. Downing A.K. Rao Z. Hewett D.R. Sykes B.C. Kielty C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6751-6756Google Scholar, 41Wu Y.-S. Bevilacqua V.L.H. Berg J.M. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 91-97Google Scholar). Although little is known about the contribution of calcium to the biology of the fibrillins, it has been demonstrated that calcium mediates protein-protein interaction (28Reinhardt D.P. Sasaki T. Dzamba B.J. Keene D.R. Chu M.-L. Göhring W. Timpl R. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19489-19496Google Scholar) and that calcium plays a role in maturation of a precursor fibrillin (42Raghunath M. Kielty C.M. Kainulainen K. Child A. Peltonen L. Steinmann B. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 889-896Google Scholar) and in stabilization of fibrillin molecules and microfibrils (40Knott V. Downing D.K. Cardy C.M. Handford P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 22-27Google Scholar, 43Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Google Scholar, 44Kielty C.M. Shuttleworth C.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 323-326Google Scholar).In this study, we tested possible stabilizing effects of calcium on fibrillin-1 in protease degradation assays using neutral proteases. We found consistently that radiolabeled authentic fibrillin-1 as well as recombinant subdomains that span the full length of fibrillin-1 are significantly more susceptible to proteolytic degradation in the absence of calcium. These results clearly demonstrate that calcium stabilizes fibrillin-1 against proteolysis. Degradation by serine proteases of fibrillin and its assembly products, the microfibrils, was reported previously (45Kielty C.M. Woolley D.E. Whittaker S.P. Shuttleworth C.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 85-89Google Scholar). The contribution of calcium to protease susceptibility of fibrillin and microfibrils, however, was not tested.To analyze regions that are protected by calcium, we produced a new recombinant subdomain of fibrillin-1 that contains the longest stretch of cbEGF-like motifs in the molecule and the preceding 8-cysteine motif at the N-terminal end. Structural characterization of this subdomain by rotary shadowing revealed an extended shape similar to regions in fibrillin purified from cell culture (37Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14763-14770Google Scholar). The analysis of degradation products demonstrated that labile sites that are protected by calcium are located in the regions between cysteines 1 and 2 and between cysteines 3 and 4 of cbEGF-like motif 11. It was shown that the structural change upon calcium binding is localized to the N-terminal pocket of a single cbEGF-like repeat of factor X (38Selander-Sunnerhagen M. Ullner M. Persson E. Teleman O. Stenflo J. Drakenberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19642-19649Google Scholar) or factor IX (39Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Google Scholar). Labile sites Met1034 and Asn1046 are located near this region in cbEGF-like motif 11, and thus, enhanced proteolytic degradation upon removal of calcium can be explained by a structural change and by reduced steric hindrance. Other degradation products were observed in the regions between cysteines 5 and 6 of cbEGF-like motifs 12 and 17 (Ser1103 and Thr1318) and in the interdomain region (Ile1019) connecting the third 8-cysteine motif with cbEGF-like motif 11. However, no structural changes in these regions upon calcium binding have been observed in single cbEGF-like motifs (38Selander-Sunnerhagen M. Ullner M. Persson E. Teleman O. Stenflo J. Drakenberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19642-19649Google Scholar, 39Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Google Scholar), and no stabilizing ligand for the calcium ion originates in this region in a pair of repeats (cbEGF-like repeats 32 and 33) (43Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Google Scholar). As suggested by Wu et al. (41Wu Y.-S. Bevilacqua V.L.H. Berg J.M. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 91-97Google Scholar), additional coordination sites for calcium binding could be provided by an aspartate or asparagine residue at position −4 or −6 from the last cysteine of the preceding N-terminal cbEGF-like repeat, thus stabilizing the loop between cysteines 5 and 6 of this repeat. However, no appropriate aspartate or asparagine residue is located in the last loop of cbEGF-like repeats 12 and 17.The lack of explanation for these labile sites may suggest that tandemly repeated cbEGF-like repeats of n > 2 are stabilized by calcium in a yet unknown manner. Therefore, the stabilizing effect of calcium binding on the last loop of the previous repeat remains to be established.We suggest that the protective nature of calcium against proteolytic degradation of cbEGF-like repeats may be a general function of calcium binding to this type of repeat. In fibrillins, as well as in other proteins containing these repeats, this could preserve important spacer functions of tandem stretches between functional domains or protect protein-binding domains against proteolytic attack. For example, the spacer between protein-binding domains in nidogen, consisting of five consecutive EGF-like repeats, two of which are of the calcium-binding type, could be stabilized by calcium. Another example is the binding of the Drosophila transmembrane protein Notch (cbEGF-like motifs 11 and 12) to Delta and Serrate (27Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1991; 67: 687-699Google Scholar), where calcium binding, in addition to mediating the protein-protein interaction, could also preserve the binding domain against proteolytic degradation.The results presented in this study are of particular interest for the pathology of genetic diseases in which certain missense mutations in cbEGF-like motifs are known and predicted to disrupt calcium binding. These disorders include Marfan's syndrome (30Dietz H.C. Pyeritz R.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1799-1809Google Scholar), hemophilia B (46Giannelli F. Green P.M. Sommer S.S. Poon M.C. Ludwig M. Schwaab R. Reitsma P.H. Goossens M. Yoshioka A. Brownlee G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 103-118Google Scholar), and Protein S deficiency (47Gandrille S. Borgel D. Eschwege-Gufflet V. Aillaud M. Dreyfus M. Matheron C. Gaussem P. Abgrall J.F. Jude B. Sie P. Toulon P. Aiach M. Blood. 1995; 85: 130-138Google Scholar). In Marfan's syndrome, most of the over 50 mutations known today (reviewed in 30Dietz H.C. Pyeritz R.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1799-1809Google Scholar) occur in cbEGF-like motifs and are predicted to disrupt calcium binding by changes in amino acid residues important for calcium binding or by cysteine substitutions resulting in an uneven number of cysteine residues. In fact, mutation analysis with synthetic peptides demonstrated that a mutation affecting the asparagine residue predicted to be β-hydroxylated (N2144S) (48Hewett D.R. Lynch J.R. Smith R. Sykes B.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 475-477Google Scholar) in cbEGF-like motif 32 of fibrillin-1 decreased calcium binding by >5-fold (23Handford P. Downing A.K. Rao Z. Hewett D.R. Sykes B.C. Kielty C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6751-6756Google Scholar). We suggest that mutations that affect calcium binding to individual cbEGF-like motifs render the molecule more susceptible to proteolysis. This could affect the biology of fibrillin on different levels, as single molecules or as aggregated microfibrils. Mutant fibrillin molecules could be degraded intracellularly or extracellularly, before they are incorporated into microfibrils, which would lead in turn to a diminished number of microfibrils in affected individuals. If mutant fibrillin molecules are incorporated into microfibrils, a dual mechanism may be possible. Although different models for the assembly of fibrillin into microfibrils have been published, they all place the majority of the cbEGF-like motifs into the interbead domains (23Handford P. Downing A.K. Rao Z. Hewett D.R. Sykes B.C. Kielty C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6751-6756Google Scholar, 24Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Google Scholar, 43Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Google Scholar). Calcium binding to these cbEGF-like repeats has been suggested to rigidify the region between two cbEGF-like domains (40Knott V. Downing D.K. Cardy C.M. Handford P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 22-27Google Scholar, 43Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Google Scholar) and to play a role in lateral packing of the fibrillin molecules within microfibrils (39Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Google Scholar, 44Kielty C.M. Shuttleworth C.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 323-326Google Scholar). Microfibrils isolated from a cell line that was established from an individual carrying the N2144S mutation appeared disorganized in their interbead domains (23Handford P. Downing A.K. Rao Z. Hewett D.R. Sykes B.C. Kielty C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6751-6756Google Scholar), similar to the appearance of the interbead regions of microfibrils from normal individuals after treatment with EDTA (44Kielty C.M. Shuttleworth C.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 323-326Google Scholar). These data, combined with our observations described here, suggest that mutations that disturb calcium binding may result in (i) a local loosening of the compact interbead regions of the microfibrils and (ii) proteolysis of loose fibrillin molecules in the interbead region.In our experiments, often, the degraded subdomains are still held together by disulfide bonds, demonstrating that cleavages occur within disulfide-bonded loops and only to a lesser extent between individual motifs. Thus, if indeed Marfan's microfibrils are more susceptible to proteolysis, it is expected that the microfibrils with endogenous degradation sites would not be fully cleaved immediately. Rather, Marfan's microfibrils (composed of 50% normal fibrillin-1 and 50% mutant fibrillin-1) would display small “Achilles heels,” endogenous sites for potential degradation. Endogenous degradation at these sites might impair important functions like protein binding or physically weaken the microfibrils. In affected individuals, this might lead to a slow but steady decline of the microfibrils, which could explain the progressive nature of Marfan's syndrome. Currently, we are investigating this hypothesis with recombinant subdomains harboring typical mutations in cbEGF-like motifs.Mutations in a central region of fibrillin-1 (8-cysteine motif 3 and cbEGF-like repeat 11) have been suggested to result in neonatal Marfan's syndrome (49Kainulainen K. Karttunen L. Puhakka L. Sakai L. Peltonen L. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 64-69Google Scholar), a severe form of the disease where children often die within the first year after birth. Immunofluorescence labeling of fibrillin in cell lines established from individuals with neonatal Marfan's syndrome often shows stippled, frayed, and very short fibrils (50Superti-Furga A. Raghunath M. Willems P.J. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 29: 875-878Google Scholar, 51Godfrey M. Raghunath M. Cisler J. Bevins C.L. DePaepe A. Di Rocco M. Gregoritch J. Imaizumi K. Kaplan P. Kuroki Y. Silberbach M. Superti-Furga A. Van Thienen M.-N. Vetter U. Steinmann B. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1414-1421Google Scholar, 52Wang M. Price C. Han J. Cisler J. Imaizumi K. Van Thienen M.-N. DePaepe A. Godfrey M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 607-613Google Scholar). This is in contrast to labeling patterns observed in cell lines obtained from classic Marfan's individuals, where the integrity of the fibrillin network often appears relatively normal, but reduced in amount. These observations led to the suggestion that the neonatal region is essential for microfibril formation (53Putnam E.A. Cho M. Zinn A.B. Towbin J.A. Byers P.H. Milewicz D.M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 62: 233-242Google Scholar). Interestingly, three out of five labile sites observed in our study are located in the neonatal region of the molecule. This region may be particularly sensitive to proteolytic degradation when mutations causing neonatal Marfan's syndrome impair (or influence) calcium binding to this region. It is possible that fibrillin molecules aggregate to form the nuclei for fibril formation (clumps in immunofluorescence images), but the elongation of the microfibrils might be hindered due to the lack of bound calcium and/or endogenous degradation within the neonatal region. Alternatively, since one of the observed sensitive sites (Ile1019) is located in the interdomain region connecting the third 8-cysteine motif with the downstream cbEGF-like motif and therefore is not located within a disulfide-bonded loop, proteolytic degradation at or close to this site would cause the microfibrils to fall apart rapidly. This would explain the frayed and short microfibrils observed in immunofluorescence experiments with neonatal Marfan's cell lines and the rapid progression of neonatal Marfan's syndrome.

A characteristic pattern of amino acid residues ((D/N)X(D/N)(Q/E)Xn(D*/N*)Xm(Y/F); residues with an asterisk may be β-hydroxylated) has been identified in a subset of EGF-like motifs that is responsible for calcium binding. Calcium binding to this type of motif has been demonstrated with blood clotting factors IX and X (18Persson E. Selander M. Linse S. Drakenberg T. Öhlin A.-K. Stenflo J. J. Biol.

Linse S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18481-18489Google Scholar), and the microfibrillar protein fibrillin-1 (22Glanville R.W. Qian R.-Q. McClure D.W. Maslen C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26630-26634Google Scholar, 23Handford P. Downing A.K. Rao Z. Hewett D.R. Sykes B.C. Kielty C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6751-6756Google Scholar, 24Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R.

Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Google Scholar).Little is known about the functional significance of these motifs and the consequences of calcium binding on the properties of proteins containing these motifs. It has been suggested that calcium binding to cbEGF-like motifs mediates protein-protein interactions. For example, mutations of amino acid residues crucial for calcium binding affect the clotting activity of factor IX (25Rees D.J.G. Jones I.M. Handford P.A. Walter S.J. Esnouf M.P. Smith K.J. Brownlee G.G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2053-2061Google Scholar). The interaction of Protein S with complement C4b-binding protein is mediated by this type of module (26Dahlbäck B. Frohm B. Nelsestuen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16082-16087Google Scholar), and the interaction of the Drosophila transmembrane protein Notch with Delta and Serrate depends on two tandemly repeated cbEGF-like motifs (27Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1991; 67: 687-699Google Scholar). Possibly, cbEGF-like motifs are also involved in mediating the calcium-dependent interaction of fibrillin-1 with fibulin-2 (28Reinhardt D.P. Sasaki T. Dzamba B.J. Keene D.R. Chu M.-L. Göhring W. Timpl R. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19489-19496Google Scholar).The fibrillin family consists of two members, fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, both of which are integral constituents of the 10-12-nm diameter extracellular matrix microfibrils (5Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D. Hu W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Google Scholar, 29Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Google Scholar). Both proteins consist of repetitive motifs: 47 of them are EGF-like repeats, and 43 have the consensus sequence for calcium binding. The cbEGF-like repeats are dispersed over both entire molecules in nine stretches of 1-12 tandemly repeated motifs.Mutations in fibrillin-1 result in Marfan's syndrome, a connective tissue disorder affecting the cardiovascular, skeletal, and ocular systems (reviewed in 30Dietz H.C. Pyeritz R.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1799-1809Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutations in fibrillin-2 give rise to congenital contractural arachnodactyly, a disorder characterized primarily by joint contractures and other skeletal features (31Putnam E.A. Zhang H. Ramirez F. Milewicz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 456-458Google Scholar). Most of the more than 50 known mutations in fibrillin-1 and the two mutations in fibrillin-2 occur in cbEGF-like repeats and are predicted to disturb calcium binding, suggesting an important role of the cbEGF-like repeats in these proteins.In this study, we investigated the effect of calcium binding on the stability of fibrillin-1 in protease degradation assays. These results demonstrate that calcium stabilizes fibrillin-1 against proteolytic degradation. This may be a general functional aspect for cbEGF-like motifs in other proteins. We hypothesize that mutations in fibrillin-1, and possibly in other proteins, that disturb calcium binding to cbEGF-like motifs render the molecules more susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Progressive degradation of the molecules or their assembly products could thus lead to the pathology of the disease."

INTRODUCTIONCells maintain exquisite control over the level of free cholesterol through a complex set of homeostatic mechanisms that control the rates of cholesterol biosynthesis, cholesterol esterification, and receptor mediated endocytosis of cholesterol-rich low density lipoproteins (LDL 1The abbreviations used are: LDLlow density lipoproteinACATacyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferaseHMG-CoA3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme AERendoplasmic reticulumMDRmultidrug resistanceCHOChinese hamster ovaryβ-VLDLvery low density lipoproteinDHEAdehydroepiandrosteroneRfretention fraction in thin layer chromatography. ; reviewed by Goldstein and Brown (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Google Scholar)). Cholesterol esterification is catalyzed by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involves the covalent attachment of fatty acids to the 3-position hydroxyl group of cholesterol to form cholesteryl esters. In a homeostatic process, excess free cholesterol stimulates esterification resulting in the storage of excess cholesterol in the form of cytosolic lipid droplets. While free cholesterol can be toxic to cells, cholesteryl esters can accumulate to relatively high levels. Under most physiologic conditions, the rate of cholesterol esterification is not limited by ACAT levels but rather by the availability of cholesterol substrate in the ER (2Suckling K.E. Boyd G.S. Smellie C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 710: 154-163Google Scholar, 3Doolittle G.M. Chang T.-Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 674-679Google Scholar). Very little cholesterol is found in the ER; 90% of all cholesterol resides in the plasma membrane (4Lange Y. Swaisgood M.H. Ramos B.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3786-3793Google Scholar), and most of the remainder is found in endocytic vesicles derived from the plasma membrane (5Lange Y. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 329-339Google Scholar). Under conditions of excess cholesterol, cholesterol is transported from the plasma membrane to the ER where it is esterified by ACAT. The mechanism by which this transport occurs is poorly understood.The delivery of plasma membrane cholesterol to the ER is also required for a number of other processes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, resides in the ER even though both its substrate and product are cytosolic. Excess free cholesterol decreases HMG-CoA reductase activity by enhancing the rate of enzyme degradation. This enhanced rate of degradation requires the transmembrane portion of the protein that anchors it to the ER (6Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Google Scholar). In addition, DNA-binding proteins (SREBPs) that control transcription of HMG-CoA reductase, the LDL receptor, and a number of other enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism are originally synthesized with a membrane spanning domain that anchors them to the ER (7Wang X. Sato R. Brown M. Hua X. Goldstein J. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Google Scholar). When sterol levels fall, specific proteolysis of SREBPs releases the DNA-binding domains which then enter the nucleus to promote transcription of sterol-regulated genes. Finally, enzymes involved in the final steps of cholesterol biosynthesis reside in the ER, and the delivery of sterol precursors to these ER-resident enzymes is required for the final steps of cholesterol biosynthesis (8Lange Y. Echevarria F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21439-21443Google Scholar, 9Reinhart M.P. Billheimer J.T. Faust J.R. Gaylor J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9649-9655Google Scholar). Although the delivery of sterols to the ER clearly plays an important role in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism, very little is known about how sterols are transported to the ER and how this transport is regulated.The distribution of sphingomyelin within the cell closely mimics that of cholesterol; greater than 90% of cellular sphingomyelin is found in the plasma membrane and very little is found in the ER (4Lange Y. Swaisgood M.H. Ramos B.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3786-3793Google Scholar). Cholesterol and sphingomyelin interact with high affinity in model membranes, and it has been suggested that this interaction is responsible for localizing cholesterol to the plasma membrane (10Wattenberg B.W. Silbert D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2284-2289Google Scholar). In fact, reducing plasma membrane sphingomyelin levels by adding exogenous sphingomyelinase, releases cholesterol from the plasma membrane allowing it to enter intracellular pools which leads to increased cholesterol esterification (11Slotte J.P. Bierman E.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 653-658Google Scholar) and HMG-CoA reductase degradation (11Slotte J.P. Bierman E.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 653-658Google Scholar, 12Gupta A.K. Rudney H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 125-136Google Scholar).Progesterone has long been known to inhibit cholesterol esterification, and early studies suggested that this inhibition resulted from a direct interaction between progesterone and ACAT (13Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9344-9352Google Scholar). However, more recent studies suggest that progesterone may indirectly block esterification by preventing delivery of cholesterol substrate to ACAT. In cultured cells, progesterone blocks transport of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to the ER (14Lange Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3411-3414Google Scholar) and causes sequestration of cholesterol within the lysosome (15Butler J.D. Blanchette-Mackie J. Goldin E. O'Neill R.R. Carstea G. Roff C.F. Patterson M.C. Patel S. Comly M.E. Cooney A. Vanier M.T. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23797-23805Google Scholar). Progesterone interacts with two cellular proteins: the progesterone receptor (reviewed by Evans (16Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar)) and members of the multiple-drug resistance (MDR) family of P-glycoproteins (17Yang C.-P.H. DePinho S.G. Greenberger L.M. Arceci R.J. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 782-788Google Scholar). Interaction of progesterone with the progesterone receptor alters the rate of transcription of progesterone-sensitive genes. Cellular events initiated by the progesterone receptor: 1) occur at nanomolar progesterone concentrations, 2) are inhibited by RU486, a specific antagonist of the progesterone receptor, and 3) demonstrate a characteristic lag due to the time required for altered transcriptional events to be manifested in altered protein and activity levels.Progesterone also interacts with members of the MDR family of P-glycoproteins. MDR proteins act as energy-dependent drug efflux pumps that reduce drug cytotoxicity when overexpressed (reviewed by Ling (18Ling V. Cancer. 1992; 69: 2603-2609Google Scholar)). Progesterone binds directly to the MDR pump to inhibit its activity (17Yang C.-P.H. DePinho S.G. Greenberger L.M. Arceci R.J. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 782-788Google Scholar, 19Qian X. Beck W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18753-18756Google Scholar). In multidrug-resistant J774.2 cell lines, a number of other steroids, including deoxycorticosterone, testosterone, and corticosterone, also inhibit MDR activity, and although no specific structure explains their relative effectiveness, a correlation has been observed between steroid hydrophobicity and inhibition of MDR activity (17Yang C.-P.H. DePinho S.G. Greenberger L.M. Arceci R.J. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 782-788Google Scholar).In the current studies, we exclude a role for the progesterone receptor in progesterone's ability to inhibit cholesterol esterification. Rather, we show that progesterone's ability to inhibit MDR activity is directly correlated with the inhibition of cholesterol esterification. We find that this inhibition results from a direct inability to esterify plasma membrane-derived cholesterol, and that these phenomena are observed in a wide range of cultured human cell lines. These findings, in conjunction with our recent observations that MDR activity is required for cholesterol biosynthesis (20Metherall J.E. Waugh K. Li H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2627-2633Google Scholar, 21Metherall J.E. Li H. Waugh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2634-2640Google Scholar), suggest a general role for MDR in normal cellular cholesterol metabolism.DISCUSSIONMDR P-glycoproteins were originally identified for their ability to confer drug resistance when overexpressed; however, their normal physiologic function is not well understood. The ability of P-glycoproteins to catalyze the efflux of unnatural drugs led to the hypothesis that MDR normally functions in detoxification. Support for this hypothesis comes from studies of mice with a homozygous disruption of the mdr3 gene which is primarily expressed at the blood-brain barrier. These mice are phenotypically normal unless challenged with drugs; the mice demonstrate increased sensitivity to amphiphilic drugs, especially in the brain (27Schinkel A.H. Smit J.J. van Tellingen O. Beijnen J.H. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A. van der Valk M.A. Robanus-Maandag E.C. te Riele H.P.J. Berns A.J.M. Borst P. Cell. 1994; 77: 491-502Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that the normal physiologic role of MDR is to catalyze the transport of normal cellular lipids across membranes. Mice with a homozygous disruption of mdr2, which is expressed predominantly in bile cannicula (28Buschman E. Arceci R.J. Croop J.M. Che M. Arias I.M. Housman D.E. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18093-18099Google Scholar), develop severe liver disease due to a lack of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol production into bile (29Smit J.J. Schinkel A.H. Oude Elferink R.P. Groen A.K. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A. Ottenhoff R. van der Lugt N.M. van Roon M.A. van der Valk M.A. Offerhaus G.J.A. Berns A.J.M. Borst P. Cell. 1993; 75: 451-462Google Scholar). In addition, mdr2 catalyzes the ATP-dependent translocation of phosphatidylcholine across secretory vesicles when expressed in yeast (30Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the mdr1 (mdr1b) gene in a mouse adrenal cell line decreased the stimulated secretion of steroid hormones from the cell (31Altuvia S. Stein W.D. Goldenberg S. Kane S.E. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27127-27132Google Scholar). These experiments strongly suggest that MDR proteins catalyze the transport of normal cellular lipids across membranes.A number of recent lines of evidence suggest that MDR activity is required for cholesterol esterification. A series of amphiphilic agents, known to modulate MDR activity, blocked transport of cholesterol substrate from the plasma membrane to ER-resident ACAT in a cultured rat hepatoma cell line (32Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29371-29374Google Scholar). However, the cell line used has never been shown to have MDR activity. Known inhibitors of MDR also inhibited the movement of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to the ER in CaCo2 cells (33Field F.J. Born E. Chen H. Murthy S. Mathur S.N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1533-1543Google Scholar), which are known to express MDR activity. Although these studies suggest a role for MDR in cholesterol esterification, no direct correlation between MDR activity and cholesterol esterification has yet been provided.In the current studies, we exclude a role for the progesterone receptor in cholesterol esterification and demonstrate a direct correlation between measured MDR activity and cholesterol esterification. This correlation is observed with both steroidal and nonsteroidal MDR inhibitors. Since progesterone, verapamil, and β-estradiol are all known to physically interact with MDR to inhibit its activity (19Qian X. Beck W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18753-18756Google Scholar, 34Rao U.S. Fine R.L. Scarborough G.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 287-292Google Scholar), the most likely explanation for the observed correlation is that changes in cholesterol esterification are a consequence of the effect of these inhibitors on MDR activity. However, our studies do not formally exclude the possibility that cholesterol esterification is required for MDR activity or that both processes are sensitive to common change in membrane composition introduced by amphiphilic compounds.We also demonstrate a direct correlation between MDR activity and cholesterol esterification in a number of cultured human cell lines. These results extend previous observations by implicating MDR as being involved in a general cellular process that is required for esterification. Recently we have demonstrated that MDR activity is also required for the late steps of cholesterol biosynthesis (20Metherall J.E. Waugh K. Li H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2627-2633Google Scholar, 21Metherall J.E. Li H. Waugh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2634-2640Google Scholar), a process that requires the transport of sterol precursors from the plasma membrane to the ER (8Lange Y. Echevarria F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21439-21443Google Scholar, 9Reinhart M.P. Billheimer J.T. Faust J.R. Gaylor J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9649-9655Google Scholar). MDR inhibitors also block cholesterol biosynthesis in a wide range of cultured human cell lines, supporting the observation that MDR activity is required for a general cellular process involved in sterol transport. Although these studies demonstrate that MDR is required for cholesterol esterification, further studies are required to determine the mechanism by which it participates in this process.

We report the cloning and characterization of human cDNAs encoding two of its subunits, p110 and p36. It was found that the second slowest band during polyacrylamide gel electrophresis of eIF3 subunits in sodium dodecyl sulfate contains two proteins: p110 and p116. Analysis of the cloned cDNA encoding p110 indicates that its amino acid sequence is 31% identical to that of the yeast protein, Nip1. The p116 cDNA was cloned and characterized as a human homolog of yeast Prt1, as described elsewhere (Méthot, N., Rom, E., Olsen, H., and Sonenberg, N. (1997) J. Biol.

The p116, p110, and p36 subunits localize on 40 S ribosomes in cells active in translation and co-immunoprecipitate with affinity-purified antibodies against the p170 subunit, showing that these proteins are integral components of eIF3. Although p36 and p116 have homologous protein subunits in yeast eIF3, the p110 homolog, Nip1, is not detected in yeast eIF3 preparations.

The p116, p110, and p36 subunits localize on 40 S ribosomes in cells active in translation and co-immunoprecipitate with affinity-purified antibodies against the p170 subunit, showing that these proteins are integral components of eIF3. Although p36 and p116 have homologous protein subunits in yeast eIF3, the p110 homolog, Nip1, is not detected in yeast eIF3 preparations. The results indicate both conservation and diversity in eIF3 between yeast and humans."

To determine the mechanism responsible for p21 induction during differentiation of mouse primary keratinocytes, we performed a deletion analysis of the p21 promoter. The minimal region of the p21 promoter required for its induction in keratinocyte differentiation consists of a contiguous stretch of 78 base pairs, which contains a GC-rich region as well as the TATA box. We determined that transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3, present in primary keratinocyte nuclear extracts, bind the GC region concomitantly. Expression studies established that both Sp1 and Sp3 activate the p21 promoter, but showed that only Sp3 overexpression enhances promoter inducibility during differentiation. Furthermore, disruption of the GC-rich region dramatically decreases transcription factor binding as well as promoter activity and inducibility upon differentiation. The overexpression of either Sp1 or Sp3 restores the basal activity of the disrupted promoter, but only Sp3 can restore its inducibility. These findings show that both Sp1 and Sp3 can contribute to the basal activity of the p21 promoter, and establish Sp3 as a specific transcription factor involved in the induction of p21 promoter during keratinocyte differentiation.

However, the molecular basis of these interactions is not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate that SHP-2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by and associated with JAK1 and JAK2 but not JAK3 in COS-1 cell cotransfection experiments. SHP-2 phosphatase activity appears not to be required for JAK and SHP-2 interactions because SHP-2 with a mutation at amino acid 463 from Cys to Ser, which renders SHP-2 inactive, can still bind JAKs. We further demonstrate that SHP-2 SH2 domains (amino acids 1-209) are not essential for the association of JAKs with SHP-2, and the region between amino acids 232 and 272 in SHP-2 is important for the interactions. Furthermore, tyrosine residues 304 and 327 in SHP-2 are phosphorylated by JAKs, and phosphorylated SHP-2 can associate with the downstream adapter protein Grb2. Finally, deletion of the N terminus but not the kinase-like domain of JAK2 abolishes the association of JAK2 with SHP-2.

Signaling through cytokine receptors is mediated in part by the activation of protein tyrosine kinases, particularly the Janus family kinases (JAKs) (17Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Google Scholar). The basic characteristics of JAK tyrosine kinases include a C-terminal kinase domain, an adjacent kinase-like domain of unknown function, and an N-terminal JAK homology domain (18Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Kurban R.R. Ralph S.J. Zurcher G. Ziemiecki A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2057-2063Google Scholar). The pivotal roles of JAK kinases in signaling pathways were first shown in the interferon system (19Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar, 20Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Google Scholar). Subsequent demonstration for the involvement of JAK2 in erythropoietin, growth hormone, and interleukin 3 signaling has established critical roles of JAK kinases in cytokine signal transduction (21Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W.

The interactions between protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (previously known as PTP1C, SHPTP-1, SHP, and HCP) and JAK2 in erythropoietin signaling have been shown previously (24Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Google Scholar). The SHP-1 and JAK2 interactions resulted in dephosphorylation of JAK2 and termination of JAK2-mediated signaling (24Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Google Scholar). Thus, SHP-1 may serve as a negative regulator in erythropoietin signaling. Recently, SHP-2 protein-tyrosine phosphatase has been shown to play positive roles in signal transmission, and the interactions between SHP-2 and JAK kinases have been implicated in signaling pathways mediated by erythropoietin, interleukin 3, interleukin 11, and prolactin (13Welham M.J.

Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular basis of interactions between SHP-2 and JAKs. Here we demonstrate the association between JAKs and SHP-2 in COS-1 cell cotransfection experiments and identify novel regions in SHP-2 and JAKs that mediate these interactions. Antibodies for JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and phosphotyrosine were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Affinity-purified anti-Grb2 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibodies for SHP-2 were produced as described (1Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-SHP-2 and anti-Flag antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratory (Lexington, KY) and Eastman Kodak Company, respectively. ECL detection kit was from Amersham Corp. N-[1-(2,3-Dioleoyloxyl)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammoniummethyl sulfate transfection reagents were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. The cDNAs encoding murine JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and SHP-2 were subcloned into mammalian expression vectors pRc/CMV or pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). The C-terminal truncations of SHP-2 were created by polymerase chain reaction and subcloning into pRc/CMV or pCDNA3. Deletion of SH2 domains of SHP-2 was done by subcloning the PstI fragment (amino acids 209-585) into Flag-tagged expression vector pFlag-CMV-2 (Kodak). Phosphatase-inactive mutant of SHP-2 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (changing amino acid 463 from Cys to Ser). Deletion of the kinase-like domain in JAK2 was obtained by ligation after removing the BglII fragment, which includes the kinase-like domain. The N-terminal deletion of JAK2 was done by restriction enzyme digestion (XhoI/XbaI or KpnI/XbaI), and the fragments from XhoI/XbaI or KpnI/XbaI digestion were subcloned into pFlag-CMV-2. All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. COS-1 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For cotransfection experiments, COS-1 cells were seeded in 100-mm tissue culture dishes 24 h before transfection, and subconfluent cells were transfected with various combinations of plasmid constructs (see “Results and Discussion”) by the N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxyl)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammoniummethyl sulfate method as described previously (25Yin T. Keller S.R. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Tsang M.L.-S. Lienhard G.E. Ihle J.N. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20497-20502Google Scholar). Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) 48 h after transfection. The procedures for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were described previously (26Yin T. Tsang M.L.-S. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26614-26617Google Scholar, 27Yin T. Yasukawa K.

In short, cell lysates from a 100-mm dish were immunoprecipitated with either SHP-2 (1 μl), JAK (1 μl), or Flag (4 μg) antibodies as indicated under “Results and Discussion.” The immunoprecipitates were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto PVDF membranes, and immunoblotted with either phosphotyrosine (1 μg/ml), SHP-2 (monoclonal antibodies, 1 μg/ml), JAK (1:2000), or Flag (monoclonal antibodies, 5 μg/ml) antibodies as described under “Results and Discussion.” Recent studies have shown that SHP-2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in signaling pathways mediated by cytokines that activate JAK family tyrosine kinases (13Welham M.J. Dechert U. Leslie K.B. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23764-23768Google Scholar, 14Tauchi T. Feng G.-S. Shen R. Hoatlin M. Bagby Jr., G.C. Kabat D. Lu L. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol.

Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Google Scholar), indicating potential interactions between SHP-2 and JAKs. In the present study, we examined whether SHP-2 can be tyrosine-phosphorylated by JAK non-receptor tyrosine kinases and determined regions required for JAK and SHP-2 interactions. Wild-type SHP-2 cDNA (8 μg/transfection) was cotransfected into COS-1 cells with 15 μg of either JAK1, JAK2, or JAK3 cDNA, and the interactions between SHP-2 and JAKs were analyzed 48 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 1A, two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with molecular masses of 70 and 130 kDa were observed in anti-SHP-2 immunoprecipitation from cells cotransfected with SHP-2 and JAK1 or JAK2 but not JAK3 cDNAs. We further confirmed by immunoblotting that the 70- and 130-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are SHP-2 and JAK1 or JAK2, respectively, as shown in the lower panels of Fig. 1A. These results demonstrated that SHP-2 is not only tyrosine-phosphorylated by, but also tightly associated with, JAK1 and JAK2. The inability of SHP-2 to interact with JAK3 was not due to the lack of expression of JAK3 because equal levels of JAK expression were detected in cotransfected COS-1 cells (data not shown). To test whether phosphatase activity of SHP-2 is required for its interactions with JAK kinases, a phosphatase inactive mutant of SHP-2, SHP-2*, was similarly cotransfected with different JAKs into COS-1 cells (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1B shows that the phosphatase activity of SHP-2 is not required for its association with JAK1 and JAK2 because point mutation at amino acid 463 from Cys to Ser, which inactivates SHP-2, did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation and association of SHP-2* with JAK1 or JAK2. In the reciprocal immunoprecipitation as shown in Fig. 1C, anti-JAK1 or anti-JAK2 antibodies immunoprecipitated the 130-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK1 or JAK2 protein and coprecipitated the 70-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated SHP-2, although many more cell lysates and antibodies were required. Taken together, these results indicate that SHP-2 and JAKs can specifically associate and form stable complexes in vivo. It is well known that cytokine receptors and signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats) are substrates for JAK tyrosine kinases (19Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar). Recent studies have also shown that insulin receptor substrate-1 and −2 are physiological substrates for JAK kinases in certain cytokine signaling (25Yin T. Keller S.R. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Tsang M.L.-S. Lienhard G.E. Ihle J.N. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20497-20502Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that SHP-2 is not only a specific substrate for JAK1 and JAK2 in vivo but also is tightly associated with JAK1 and JAK2. The physiological interactions between SHP-2 and JAK kinases implicate important roles in cytokine signaling. For example, SHP-2 and JAK2 interactions have been shown to be essential for gene expression mediated by prolactin (16Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J. Vogel W. Kharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Google Scholar). Interestingly, although SHP-2 is tightly associated with JAK1 or JAK2, it appears that phosphorylated JAK kinases may not be good phosphatase substrates for SHP-2 because the overall level of JAK tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity are not significantly different when compared to cotransfection of either wild-type SHP-2 (Fig. 1A) or the phosphatase-inactive SHP-2 mutant (Fig. 1B). JAK2 has also been shown to interact with protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 in erythropoietin signaling. However, these interactions between JAK2 and SHP-1 result in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JAK2, indicating that JAK2 is likely to be a potential substrate for SHP-1 (24Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Google Scholar). These results suggest that SHP-1 may act as a negative regulator, whereas SHP-2 may play positive roles in signal transmission. To understand the molecular basis of the JAK and SHP-2 interactions, we have constructed several SHP-2 C-terminal truncation mutants (SHP-2m1 to SHP-2m6) as well as a SHP-2 N-terminal deletion mutant (Flag-SHP-2) as indicated in Fig. 2A. Cotransfection of COS-1 cells with wild-type JAKs and the different C-terminal truncations of SHP-2 were then performed. Proteins encoded by different C-terminal truncation mutants of SHP-2 were immunoprecipitated with anti-SHP-2 antibodies and assessed for their status of tyrosine phosphorylation as well as association with JAKs. The results in Fig. 2B indicated that the smallest construct, SHP-2m6 (amino acids 1-232), comprised of only the two SH2 domains of SHP-2, was not tyrosine-phosphorylated and did not associate with JAKs. The inability of SHP-2m6 to associate with JAK was not due to the lack of expression of JAKs because equal levels of JAK were detected in transfected COS-1 cells (data not shown). However, a slightly longer construct SHP-2m5 (amino acids 1-272) formed a stable complex with JAKs, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 2B), indicating that the region between amino acids 232 and 272 is important for SHP-2 and JAK interactions. Interestingly, SHP-2m4 (amino acids 1-293) and SHP-2m5 (amino acids 1-272), although not tyrosine-phosphorylated, are efficiently coprecipitated with JAK1 and JAK2 (Fig. 2B), implicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 is not essential for its associations with JAKs. These results, therefore, suggest that SH2 domains of SHP-2 are insufficient for the interactions between JAKs and SHP-2, and in fact, it is the region between amino acids 232-272 in SHP-2 that is required for JAK and SHP-2 association. The sequences between amino acids 232 and 272 comprise a linker region between the SH2 domains and the phosphatase domain of SHP-2, which are highly conserved between SHP-1 and SHP-2. Site-directed mutagenesis will be essential to identify residues required for such interactions and to evaluate whether these sequences determine the specificity of SHP-1 and SHP-2. We have shown that SH2 domains of SHP-2 alone are not sufficient for its association with JAKs; however, these results did not rule out the possibility that SH2 domains plus other regions in SHP-2 may be required for its association with JAKs. To test this possibility, we have constructed a SHP-2 mutant lacking the two SH2 domains at the N terminus, as indicated in Fig. 2A (Flag-SHP-2). Cotransfection experiments of SHP-2 (positive control), Flag-SHP-2, and Flag-bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Flag-BAP; negative control) with JAK2 were performed. As indicated in Fig. 3A, total cell lysates from cotransfected cells were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE, immobilized on PVDF, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine or Flag antibodies. The results demonstrated that SHP-2 and Flag-SHP-2, but not unrelated Flag-BAP, were tyrosine-phosphorylated, suggesting that SH2 domains in SHP-2 are not necessary for recruitment and its tyrosine phosphorylation by JAK2. To further characterize interactions between the SH2 domain deleted Flag-SHP-2 and JAK2, Flag-SHP-2 proteins were immunoprecipitated from cells cotransfected with Flag-SHP-2 and JAK2 using anti-Flag antibodies and analyzed for their tyrosine phosphorylation and association with JAK2. As shown in Fig. 3B, although Flag-SHP-2 is about 52 kDa and comigrates with monoclonal anti-Flag antibodies, tyrosine phosphorylation of Flag-SHP-2 by JAK2 was evidenced by the presence of a much stronger band in Flag-SHP-2- and JAK2-cotransfected cells. The 130-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein coimmunoprecipitated with Flag-SHP-2 was further shown to be JAK2 tyrosine kinase by anti-JAK2 blotting (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that Flag-SHP-2, which lacks two N-terminal SH2 domains of SHP-2, is not only tyrosine-phosphorylated but can still tightly associate with JAK2. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that two SH2 domains in the SHP-2 molecule are not essential for JAK and SHP-2 interaction and reinforce the importance of the linker region between amino acids 232 and 272. Protein-protein interactions can be mediated by a variety of functional domains such as SH2, SH3, pleckstrin homology, and phosphotyrosine binding domains (29Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Google Scholar). It is known that SHP-2 SH2 domains interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase and other tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling molecules (1Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Google Scholar, 2Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Google Scholar, 6Tauchi T. Feng G.-S. Marshall M.S. Shen R.

Bagby Jr., G.C. Kabat D. Lu L. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5631-5635Google Scholar). Interestingly, our experiments showed that SHP-2 lacking SH2 domains is still tyrosine-phosphorylated by and associated with JAK2 when cotransfected into COS-1 cells (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that SH2 domains in SHP-2 do not interact with JAK2. SHP-2 has been shown to associate with JAK2 in certain lymphoma cells, and the level of JAK2 that associates with SHP-2 in these cells did not change whether JAK2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated (16Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J. Vogel W. Kharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Google Scholar). Because most of protein-protein interactions mediated by SH2 domains are dependent on protein-tyrosine phosphorylation (29Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Google Scholar), these data further support our observation that SHP-2 SH2 domains may not be essential for SHP-2 and JAK interactions. As shown in Fig. 2B, SHP-2m2 (amino acids 1-332) and SHP-2m3 (amino acids 1-318), but not SHP-2m4 (amino acids 1-293), were tyrosine-phosphorylated. Sequence comparison between SHP-2m2, SHP-2m3, and SHP-2m4 indicated that SHP-2m2 contains two tyrosine residues at 304 and 327. C-terminal deletion of tyrosine 327 (construct SHP-2m3) abolished the mobility shift seen in construct SHP-2m2 (Fig. 2B, top panel), suggesting that tyrosine 327 is phosphorylated and responsible for the mobility shift. Because SHP-2m3, but not SHP-2m4, is tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 2B) and the major difference between the two is the presence of tyrosine residue 304 in SHP-2m3, we speculated that residue 304 of SHP-2 may be a potential phosphorylation site for JAKs. To determine whether tyrosine residue 304 is indeed phosphorylated by JAKs, a SHP-2 mutant cDNA containing a point mutation at amino acid 304 from tyrosine to phenylalanine (SHP-2m3*) was constructed and cotransfected with JAK1 or JAK2 into COS-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, mutation of tyrosine 304 to phenylalanine (SHP-2m3*) eliminated tyrosine phosphorylation of the molecule. These results suggest that both tyrosine residues at 304 and 327 are phosphorylated. It was noted that tyrosine at 304 (YINA) contains the preferred sequence motif for SH2 binding by the downstream adapter protein Grb2. We, therefore, examined whether tyrosine-phosphorylated SHP-2m1, SHP-2m2, and SHP-2m3 could bind to Grb2. As shown in Fig. 4B, tyrosine-phosphorylated SHP-2m1, SHP-2m2, and SHP-2m3 from COS-1 cells cotransfected with various SHP-2 mutant and JAK2 cDNAs can be coprecipitated with endogenous Grb2 proteins using anti-Grb2 antibodies. Although previous studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 546 (YTNI) in SHP-2 is essential for mediating SHP-2 and Grb2 interactions (30Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Google Scholar), our data showed that SHP-2m2 and SHP-2m3, which lack tyrosine residue 546, can still interact with Grb2. In addition, SHP-2m1, which contains amino acids 1-547 including tyrosine residue 546 but not the Grb2 binding motif (YXNX) is still tyrosine-phosphorylated and binds to Grb2 (Fig. 4B), indicating that tyrosine 546 and the surrounding sequences may not be the only motif that Grb2 binds to. These results, therefore, suggest that tyrosine 304 may be another mediator for an alternative pathway coupling SHP-2 to Grb2 signaling. To characterize which portions of JAK are necessary for SHP-2 and JAK interactions, several deletion mutants of JAK2 (Fig. 5A) were also constructed. As shown in Fig. 5B, an internal deletion of the kinase-like domain (amino acids 521-745) in JAK2 did not affect the association between JAK2 and SHP-2. Deletion of the first 393 amino acids at the N terminus of JAK2 almost completely abrogated the association between JAK2 and SHP-2 (a very faint band of JAK2 lacking the N terminus can be seen in SHP-2 coimmunoprecipitation after much longer exposure). Further deletion of N-terminal JAK2 at KpnI site (deleting amino acids 1-719) completely abolished JAK2 and SHP-2 association. As shown in Fig. 5B, deletion of the kinase-like domain and the N terminus of JAK2 did not affect JAK2 autophosphorylation and activation in transfected COS-1 cells. It is clear that JAK2, deleted of its N terminus, although not able to form stable complexes with SHP-2, can still phosphorylate SHP-2 in COS-1 cell cotransfection experiments. This could be due to the weak interactions between SHP-2 and JAK2 deleted of its N terminus, and the association could have been disrupted during extraction. Additional studies using more sensitive methods, such as the yeast two-hybrid system, will be required to verify such interactions. Nevertheless, these results suggest that the N-terminal region of JAK2 is responsible for high affinity association between JAK2 and SHP-2. Recent studies suggested that the N-terminal JAK homology domain may also interact with cytokine receptors (31Frank S.J. Yi W. Zhao Y. Goldsmith J.F. Gilliland G. Jiang J. Sakai I. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14776-14785Google Scholar), although precise sequence motif(s) for such interactions is not yet known. Therefore, further identification of specific sequence motif(s) in the N-terminal JAK homology domain is required to fully understand physiological roles of JAK and SHP-2 interactions. In summary, we have demonstrated that SHP-2 is a substrate for JAK1 and JAK2. Deletion studies indicated that the sequences between amino acids 232-272, but not the SH2 domains of SHP-2, are required for JAK and SHP-2 interactions. Furthermore, tyrosine residues 304 and 327 in the SHP-2 molecule are phosphorylated by JAK kinases, and phosphorylated tyrosine 304 is capable of binding to Grb2. We have also shown that the N-terminal JAK homology domain is important for high affinity association between JAK and SHP-2. Our data indicate that novel sequences in SHP-2 are involved in the association between SHP-2 and JAKs, which differs from the interactions between SHP-2 and various receptor tyrosine kinases that are thought to be mediated by SHP-2 SH2 domains. These findings implicate novel mechanisms in protein-protein interactions and potential physiological roles between JAK and SHP-2 interactions in cellular signaling. We thank Drs. James Ihle and Bruce Witthuhn for providing JAK cDNAs and helpful suggestions and Dr. Xin-Yuan Wang for reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2084332861,"The ecto-ATPase from chicken gizzard (smooth muscle) was solubilized, and the 66-kDa cell membrane ecto-ATPase protein was purified. The protein was then subjected to both enzymatic and chemical cleavage, and the resultant peptides were purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and sequenced. Several of these internal peptide sequences were used to design oligonucleotides to screen a chicken muscle library to identify the cDNA encoding the ecto-ATPase. Two overlapping partial clones were sequenced, yielding the complete coding region and a long 3′-untranslated sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence is in agreement with the N-terminal and peptide sequences obtained from the purified protein. The chicken muscle ecto-ATPase is a slightly basic (predicted pI = 7.93) 494-amino acid protein (54.4 kDa), containing a single transmembrane domain at each end of the protein. The majority of the protein is predicted to be extracellular, making it a Type Ia plasma membrane protein. There are four putative N-glycosylation sites, a single potential cAMP/cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site, as well as a single putative tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site. Analysis of the sequence using the BLAST programs demonstrated homology with other ecto-ATPases and ecto-apyrases, including those from the parasitic protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, potato tubers, and garden pea, as well as a guanosine diphosphohydrolase from yeast. However, the most striking homology observed was to the human and mouse lymphoid cell activation antigen 39 (CD39), a molecule now known to have apyrase activity. The chicken ecto-ATPase showed considerable amino acid sequence homology with CD39 over the entire length of the sequence, excluding about 30-40 amino acids at the extreme ends of the protein (which include the two membrane-spanning helices). The sequence homology between the gizzard ecto-ATPase and CD39 was confirmed by Western blots demonstrating immunocross-reactivity between mono- and polyclonal antibodies raised against the chicken ecto-ATPase and two commercially available monoclonal antibodies against the human CD39 protein. The results suggest that the muscle ecto-ATPase may be involved in cell adhesion, since the highly homologous CD39 protein is involved in homotypic adhesion of activated B lymphocytes.

INTRODUCTIONCell membrane ecto-ATPases are millimolar divalent cation-dependent, low specificity enzymes that hydrolyze all nucleoside triphosphates (NTPases). They are integral membrane glycoproteins that can be distinguished from ecto-apyrases (ecto-ATP Diphosphohydrolases or ecto-ATPDases) by their inability to hydrolyze ADP and other nucleoside diphosphates at rates that are more than ≈1-2% that of their ATP hydrolysis rates. A recent review summarizes the properties and postulated functions of the ecto-ATPases and ecto-apyrases (1Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Google Scholar). From the results of work on the single-celled parasitic protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, it appears that the ecto-ATPase and ecto-apyrase enzymes from that source are closely related as judged by sequence analysis (2Asai T. Miura S. Sibley L.D. Okabayashi H. Takeuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11391-11397Google Scholar, 3Bermudes D. Peck K.R. Afifi M.A. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29252-29260Google Scholar). However, significant differences in enzymology and susceptibility to inactivation by detergents exist between ecto-ATPases and ecto-apyrases from a variety of sources (for a review, see 1Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Google Scholar), suggesting that they may not be as closely related to each other as is suggested by the sequence homology of the T. gondii enzymes.The physiological functions of the ecto-ATPases and ecto-apyrases are not known. However, many functions have been hypothesized, including roles in cellular adhesion, termination of purinergic signaling, and purine recycling (for a review, see 1Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Google Scholar), as well as secretion (4Strobel R. Rosenberg M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 671: 487-489Google Scholar) and vesicle trafficking (5Kittel A. Bacsy E. Cell. Biol. Int. Rep. 1994; 18: 875-880Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to clone and sequence the cDNA encoding the chicken muscle ecto-ATPase to gain information about the structure and physiological function of the whole class of ecto-ATPase enzymes by analysis of sequence homologies with proteins of known function. The sequence reported here represents the first vertebrate ecto-ATPase to be cloned and sequenced. (The rat liver cellular adhesion molecule of 105 kDa “ecto-ATPase” sequence (6Lin S.-H. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14408-14414Google Scholar) apparently does not encode the ATPase (7Knowles A.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 529-535Google Scholar), and the rat liver enzyme is classified as an ecto-apyrase since it hydrolyzes ADP as well as ATP.) The results reported here suggest that at least one physiological function of the ecto-ATPase is involvement in the process of cell adhesion, since it is highly homologous with the lymphoid cell activation antigen (CD39), 1The abbreviations used are: CD39lymphoid cell activation antigen 39BLASTbasic local alignment search toolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyACRapyrase conserved region. which is known to be involved in homotypic activated B-cell adhesion (8Kansas G.S. Wood G.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2235-2244Google Scholar). This conclusion is consistent with several previous reports obtained from several different species and tissues that suggested by indirect methods that the ecto-ATPase may be involved in cellular adhesion in rat liver (6Lin S.-H. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14408-14414Google Scholar), chicken muscle (9Cunningham H.B. Yazaki P.J. Domingo R.C. Oades K.V. Bohlen H. Sabbadini R.A. Dahms A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 32-43Google Scholar, 10Stout J.G. Strobel R.S. Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11845-11850Google Scholar), and rat brain (11Dzhandzhugazyan K. Bock E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 279-283Google Scholar), as well as the recent finding that the CD39 protein, which is involved in homotypic lymphocyte adhesion (8Kansas G.S. Wood G.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2235-2244Google Scholar), has ecto-apyrase activity (12Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9898-9901Google Scholar).RESULTSSeveral attempts to isolate the chicken gizzard ecto-ATPase cDNA from the Clontech gizzard cDNA library using conventional phage plating and screening with various radioactively labeled degenerate oligonucleotide probes proved to be unsuccessful. However, the desired clones were obtained by using a chicken muscle lambda Zap® phage cDNA library. This phage library was mass-excised and converted into a plasmid cDNA library, which is the required starting material for the GeneTrapper cDNA positive selection system kit. The GeneTrapper system then converts the double-stranded plasmid library into a single stranded library and enriches the cDNA encoding the ecto-ATPase by affinity purification using, in this case, a biotinylated degenerate probe designed from a cyanogen bromide peptide. (A chicken skeletal muscle library was used in the GeneTrapper system since no chicken gizzard (smooth muscle) cDNA library was commercially available that could be readily converted to the plasmid cDNA library required as the starting material for the GeneTrapper cDNA positive selection system.) A 2.1-kilobase pair clone (designated 19(2nd)), which hybridized to several degenerate probes designed from internal protein sequences of the 66-kDa ecto-ATPase, was sequenced. This clone was found to have approximately 750 bases of 3′-untranslated sequence and did not encode the known N-terminal sequence of the protein (13Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 29: 61-75Google Scholar). However, the deduced amino acid sequence did agree with many internal peptide sequences obtained from the purified gizzard protein. A non-degenerate probe was designed from near the 5′-end of the first clone (19(2nd)), and after rescreening the same library in the same manner, a second overlapping partial clone was found (CS-Q, 0.83 kilobase pairs). Except for approximately 20 bases at the extreme 5′-end of clone 19(2nd), the sequences in the approximately 610-base pair region of overlap between the two clones were identical, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the overlapping cDNA sequence agreed with the sequences determined from the purified protein (see Fig. 1).There is one peptide sequence (the protein N terminus) encoded by the non-overlapping 5′-end of clone CS-Q, seven peptide sequences encoded in cDNA overlap sequence between the two partial clones, and six peptide sequences encoded by the non-overlapping coding region of clone 19(2nd) (see Fig. 1). Thus, there are a total of 14 peptide sequences (including the N terminus and the membrane-spanning region very close to the predicted C terminus of the protein) that agree with the protein sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence that was spliced together from the two partial clones.The protein sequence deduced from the cDNA is a 494-amino acid protein with a calculated protein molecular mass of 54,402 Da, a pI of 7.93, and four potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1). The Kozak consensus sequence for initiation in higher eukaryotes (22Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Google Scholar) is indicated by double underlining of the DNA sequence, and the initiation methionine is marked. There is a single potential cAMP/cGMP phosphorylation site and a single potential tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site (see Fig. 1).The hydrophilicity plot analysis of the protein sequence is shown in Fig. 2, indicating the likelihood of the following membrane topology: a putative membrane-spanning region that appears to be an uncleaved signal sequence at the N terminus, a large extracellular loop containing approximately 85% of the total protein as well as all of the carbohydrates and including the active site(s), and a putative membrane-spanning region very close to the C terminus. Thus, the ecto-ATPase has the properties of a Type Ia membrane protein. Only approximately 10 amino acids are predicted to be intracellular. Also shown in Fig. 2 are the “antigenic index” and the “surface probability” as predicted by the Mac Vector computer program. These analyses reveal several potential antigenic “hot spots,” suggesting possible regions containing the epitopes recognized by existing antibodies (10Stout J.G. Strobel R.S. Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11845-11850Google Scholar, 19Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8289-8298Google Scholar), as well as indicating sequences that may be useful for the design of anti-peptide antibodies.Fig. 2Hydrophilicity, surface probability, and antigenic index analyses of the protein sequence deduced from the chicken muscle ecto-ATPase cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence was analyzed by the Mac Vector computer program. Two membrane-spanning regions are predicted from the hydrophilicity analysis, one at each end of the linear protein sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The deduced protein sequence shows homology with several known ecto-ATPases and apyrases, as shown in Fig. 3. The greatest amino acid homology is with mouse CD39, which is homologous to the entire ecto-ATPase amino acid sequence with the exception of the N- and C-terminal putative membrane-spanning regions (Fig. 3, Fig. 4).Fig. 3BLASTP and BEAUTY computer homology analyses of chicken muscle ecto-ATPase. The proteins that have significant sequence homologies as defined by smallest sum probability (P(N)) scores of less than 0.3 using the BLASTP program (20Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) are shown. The top 13 matches are shown in order of decreasing homology from top to bottom. The “score” indicates the relative degree of homology, and the regions in the linear amino acid sequence that are homologous with the chicken ecto-ATPase amino acid sequence are displayed (as detected by the BEAUTY program (21Worley K.C. Wiese B.A. Smith R.F. Genome Research. 1995; 5: 173-184Google Scholar)). The “gizzard ecto-ATPase peptide” is an internal peptide sequence of the chicken gizzard ecto-ATPase protein previously reported by our laboratory (30Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 32: 745-753Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Amino acid sequence alignment of the chicken muscle ecto-ATPase with mouse CD39 protein. Mouse CD39 protein showed the greatest homology over the widest range of all the proteins in the data base (Fig. 3). Human CD39 (not shown) is only slightly less homologous with the ecto-ATPase (Fig. 3). Asterisks (*) denote sequence identity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The close relationship of the chicken muscle ecto-ATPase with the human CD39 protein suggested by the sequence analysis was confirmed by demonstrating immunocross-reactivity of a gizzard ecto-ATPase affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (19Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8289-8298Google Scholar), a gizzard ecto-ATPase monoclonal antibody (6 (10Stout J.G. Strobel R.S. Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11845-11850Google Scholar)), and two commercially available anti-human CD39 monoclonal antibodies using two mammalian species (pig coronary artery tissue and mouse 7gg7 (B-cell hybridoma) cells), as seen in Fig. 5.Fig. 5Western blot analyses demonstrating cross-reactivity between anti-CD39 and anti-gizzard ecto-ATPase antibodies. Pig coronary artery microsomal membranes and mouse 7gg7 lymphoid cells were run on non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels in broad sample lanes and were Western blotted. The blot was cut into strips so that each sample was tested for reactivity with four different antibodies. After processing the strips of the blot separately and exposing them to the primary antibodies indicated in the figure (and the appropriate secondary antibodies), the pieces were thoroughly washed and carefully realigned for detection of antibody binding by ECL. As shown, all of the antibodies react with a protein of the same molecular mass in both samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe GeneTrapper “affinity enrichment” technique of screening a cDNA library proved successful in isolating chicken ecto-ATPase clones after several failed attempts using conventional phage plating and screening techniques. Two overlapping partial clones were isolated that encode the entire protein sequence, as judged by the agreement of both clones with many peptide sequences obtained from the gizzard ecto-ATPase purified protein (Fig. 1). The protein encoded by the cDNA sequenced is consistent with the known molecular mass of the isolated protein (54.4 kDa for the deduced sequence versus 53 kDa estimated by SDS-PAGE for the purified protein (13Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 29: 61-75Google Scholar)). The initiation methionine occurs directly before the N-terminal sequence of the mature protein and is preceded by a Kozak consensus sequence for initiation in higher eukaryotes (GCCGCC(A/G)CCATGG (22Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Google Scholar)). The slightly basic pI (7.93) predicted is also consistent with the behavior of the ecto-ATPases on ion exchange columns (13Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 29: 61-75Google Scholar, 23Stout J.G. Brittsan A. Kirley T.L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 33: 1091-1098Google Scholar) and with the assertion that much of the net negative charge on the ecto-ATPase at physiological pH is due to sialic residues on the glycan chains (24Treuheit M.J. Vaghy P.L. Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11777-11782Google Scholar). The presence of four putative glycosylation sites is consistent with our unpublished observation of at least four N-linked glycan chains as demonstrated by quantum decreases in molecular mass on SDS-PAGE during time course studies of deglycosylation of the purified enzyme by peptide N-glycosidase-F. The topological prediction of only approximately 10 amino acids of the ecto-ATPase being located intracellularly suggests that it is unlikely that the ecto-ATPase is modulated by intracellular proteins or involved in signal transduction pathways mediated by direct interactions of ecto-ATPase with intracellular proteins.As is strongly suggested by the hydrophilicity analysis and the fact that the chicken ecto-ATPase is indeed an ecto enzyme (9Cunningham H.B. Yazaki P.J. Domingo R.C. Oades K.V. Bohlen H. Sabbadini R.A. Dahms A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 32-43Google Scholar, 24Treuheit M.J. Vaghy P.L. Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11777-11782Google Scholar, 25Saborido A. Moro G. Megias A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23490-23498Google Scholar), the majority of the protein (including the active site) is located on the exterior of the cell membrane. This is confirmed by the location of the putative N-glycosylation sites, at least some of which must be glycosylated to account for purification (13Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 29: 61-75Google Scholar) and lectin modulation of activity data (9Cunningham H.B. Yazaki P.J. Domingo R.C. Oades K.V. Bohlen H. Sabbadini R.A. Dahms A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 32-43Google Scholar, 13Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 29: 61-75Google Scholar, 26Moulton M.P. Sabbadini R.A. Norton K.C. Dahms A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12244-12251Google Scholar). It seems likely that most of the cyst(e)ine residues in the large extracellular loop (11 or 12 cyst(e)ine residues depending on exactly where the N-terminal membrane-spanning sequence exits the membrane) are disulfide-bonded, since 1) they are exposed to the oxidizing extracellular media, 2) cysteine-selective chemical modification reagents are not inhibitors of chicken gizzard ecto-ATPase activity, and 3) dithiothreitol has a significant inhibitory effect on activity even though there are no intermolecular disulfide bonds in the chicken ecto-ATPase (19Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8289-8298Google Scholar). The presence of the intramolecular disulfide bonds, as well as the glycosylation, would likely increase the stability of the protein and probably contribute significantly to the resistance to proteases that is characteristic of the ecto-ATPases. The N-terminal sequence has the properties of an uncleaved signal sequence, and the assignment of membrane-spanning regions (and therefore membrane topology), appears to be straightforward. A linear model of the ecto-ATPase consistent with the sequence-derived information described above is presented in Fig. 6.Fig. 6A model of the chicken muscle ATPase. A linear model of the ecto-ATPase is proposed based on the analyses of the deduced amino acid sequence of the 66-kDa ecto-ATPase monomer. The positions of the predicted membrane-spanning helices are indicated, as are the potential N-glycosylation sites. The number and position of the disulfide bonds are not known, but their presence is likely, based on the stability of the protein to proteolysis, as well as the inhibition of ATPase activity by dithiothreitol (19Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8289-8298Google Scholar). The ATPase active site is depicted to be on the N-terminal half of the linear sequence based on the greater sequence conservation noted in that region between the chicken muscle ecto-ATPase and other ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes (see Fig. 3). Only one monomer of ecto-ATPase is shown for clarity; however, the chicken gizzard (19Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8289-8298Google Scholar) and the rabbit skeletal transverse tubule (24Treuheit M.J. Vaghy P.L. Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11777-11782Google Scholar) ecto-ATPases both exist as homooligomers in their active forms. For further details of the model, see “Discussion.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The chicken muscle ecto-ATPase is homologous to ecto-ATPases and ecto-apyrases from a variety of plants, lower organisms, and mammals (Fig. 3). The deduced amino acid sequence contains the proposed apyrase-conserved regions (ACR1-ACR4 (27Handa M. Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 916-923Google Scholar)). ACR1 and ACR4 sequences are similar to the actin-hsp70-hexokinase β- and γ-phosphate binding motifs (27Handa M. Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 916-923Google Scholar), but no Walker consensus ATP binding motif sequences (28Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Google Scholar) are present. The only ecto-ATPase/apyrase cloned and sequenced that the deduced chicken muscle ecto-ATPase amino acid sequence does not share homology with is the mosquito saliva apyrase (29Champagne D.E. Smartt C.T. Ribeiro J.M. James A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 694-698Google Scholar). The mosquito apyrase also does not have homology with other enzymes in the ecto-ATPase/apyrase family derived from many diverse species (27Handa M. Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 916-923Google Scholar), suggesting that either the mosquito enzyme is unrelated to the others or that the mosquito clone sequenced does not represent the mosquito apyrase protein.The chicken muscle ecto-ATPase-deduced amino acid sequence is most homologous with the lymphoid cell activation antigen CD39 (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). The homology encompasses the entire extracellular domain of the chicken ecto-ATPase, accounting for approximately 85% of the protein. CD39 is involved in homotypic activated lymphocyte cell adhesion (8Kansas G.S. Wood G.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2235-2244Google Scholar). Thus, this suggests that the physiological function of the ecto-ATPase is related to that of CD39-cell adhesion. This is consistent with our finding that a monoclonal antibody that recognized integrin on Western blots is capable of immunoprecipitating gizzard ecto-ATPase (10Stout J.G. Strobel R.S. Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11845-11850Google Scholar), since integrin is a ligand for other known cell adhesion molecules. Also, there are several reports in the literature that the ecto-ATPases and ecto-apyrases from various sources are either associated with or identical to adhesion molecules (6Lin S.-H. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14408-14414Google Scholar, 9Cunningham H.B. Yazaki P.J. Domingo R.C. Oades K.V. Bohlen H. Sabbadini R.A. Dahms A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 32-43Google Scholar, 11Dzhandzhugazyan K. Bock E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 279-283Google Scholar). The hypothesis supported by the body of work generated by this laboratory over the last few years (10Stout J.G. Strobel R.S. Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11845-11850Google Scholar, 13Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 29: 61-75Google Scholar, 19Stout J.G. Kirley T.L.

Int. 1994; 32: 745-753Google Scholar, 31Stout J.G. Kirley T.L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 927-934Google Scholar) is that the ecto-ATPase is not an adhesion molecule itself but is in some (yet to be understood) way critical to cell adhesion or to the regulation of the adhesive process. This regulation may be by dephosphorylation of proteins phosphorylated by ecto-protein kinases or, more likely, by control of the concentrations of extracellular nucleotides serving as triggers for cell adhesion. Human ecto-apyrase (CD39) present in vascular endothelial cells has been speculated to serve such a function in the bloodstream, i.e. to keep the levels of ADP low during normal conditions so that platelet aggregation is not induced, which would lead to pathologies associated with vascular clot formation. Related to this is the recent finding that inhibition of the vascular ecto-ATPase/apyrase by free radical-induced oxidative damage is thought to be involved in triggering the clotting responsible for the acute cessation of blood supply to xenografts, resulting in death of the transplanted tissue (32Robson S.C. Candinas D. Siegel J.B. Kopp C. Millan M. Hancock W.W. Bach F.H. Transplant. Proc. 1996; 28: 536Google Scholar). However, it seems unlikely that the chicken muscle ecto-ATPase described in this work could fulfill such a function in the circulatory system since the true ecto-ATPases, unlike the ecto-apyrases, do not hydrolyze ADP, and ADP is the nucleotide most important for the maintenance of circulatory homeostasis. INTRODUCTIONCell membrane ecto-ATPases are millimolar divalent cation-dependent, low specificity enzymes that hydrolyze all nucleoside triphosphates (NTPases). They are integral membrane glycoproteins that can be distinguished from ecto-apyrases (ecto-ATP Diphosphohydrolases or ecto-ATPDases) by their inability to hydrolyze ADP and other nucleoside diphosphates at rates that are more than ≈1-2% that of their ATP hydrolysis rates. A recent review summarizes the properties and postulated functions of the ecto-ATPases and ecto-apyrases (1Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Google Scholar). From the results of work on the single-celled parasitic protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, it appears that the ecto-ATPase and ecto-apyrase enzymes from that source are closely related as judged by sequence analysis (2Asai T. Miura S. Sibley L.D. Okabayashi H. Takeuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11391-11397Google Scholar, 3Bermudes D. Peck K.R. Afifi M.A. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29252-29260Google Scholar). However, significant differences in enzymology and susceptibility to inactivation by detergents exist between ecto-ATPases and ecto-apyrases from a variety of sources (for a review, see 1Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Google Scholar), suggesting that they may not be as closely related to each other as is suggested by the sequence homology of the T. gondii enzymes.The physiological functions of the ecto-ATPases and ecto-apyrases are not known. However, many functions have been hypothesized, including roles in cellular adhesion, termination of purinergic signaling, and purine recycling (for a review, see 1Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Google Scholar), as well as secretion (4Strobel R. Rosenberg M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 671: 487-489Google Scholar) and vesicle trafficking (5Kittel A. Bacsy E. Cell. Biol. Int. Rep. 1994; 18: 875-880Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to clone and sequence the cDNA encoding the chicken muscle ecto-ATPase to gain information about the structure and physiological function of the whole class of ecto-ATPase enzymes by analysis of sequence homologies with proteins of known function. The sequence reported here represents the first vertebrate ecto-ATPase to be cloned and sequenced. (The rat liver cellular adhesion molecule of 105 kDa “ecto-ATPase” sequence (6Lin S.-H. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14408-14414Google Scholar) apparently does not encode the ATPase (7Knowles A.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 529-535Google Scholar), and the rat liver enzyme is classified as an ecto-apyrase since it hydrolyzes ADP as well as ATP.) The results reported here suggest that at least one physiological function of the ecto-ATPase is involvement in the process of cell adhesion, since it is highly homologous with the lymphoid cell activation antigen (CD39), 1The abbreviations used are: CD39lymphoid cell activation antigen 39BLASTbasic local alignment search toolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyACRapyrase conserved region. which is known to be involved in homotypic activated B-cell adhesion (8Kansas G.S. Wood G.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2235-2244Google Scholar). This conclusion is consistent with several previous reports obtained from several different species and tissues that suggested by indirect methods that the ecto-ATPase may be involved in cellular adhesion in rat liver (6Lin S.-H. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14408-14414Google Scholar), chicken muscle (9Cunningham H.B. Yazaki P.J. Domingo R.C. Oades K.V. Bohlen H. Sabbadini R.A. Dahms A.S. Arch. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 279-283Google Scholar), as well as the recent finding that the CD39 protein, which is involved in homotypic lymphocyte adhesion (8Kansas G.S. Wood G.S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2235-2244Google Scholar), has ecto-apyrase activity (12Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9898-9901Google Scholar)."

Here, we report that the two isoforms are alternatively spliced variants of a single MCP-1 receptor gene.

In stably transfected cell lines, CCR2B trafficked well to the cell surface, but CCR2A was found predominately in the cytoplasm.

In signaling studies, both CCR2A and CCR2B mediated agonist-dependent calcium mobilization, as well as inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Creation of chimeras between CCR2A and the human thrombin receptor revealed that the cytoplasmic retention of CCR2A was due to its terminal carboxyl tail.

https://openalex.org/W1970347484,"The mechanism of inhibition of phospholipase D (PLD) by ceramides was determined using granulocytes differentiated from human promyelocytic leukemic (HL-60) cells. In a cell-free system, hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by membrane-bound PLD depended upon phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate) (GTPγS), and cytosolic factors including ADP-ribosylating factor (ARF) and RhoA. C2- (N-acetyl-), C8- (N-octanoyl-), and long-chain ceramides, but not dihydro-C2-ceramide, inhibited PLD activity. Apyrase or okadaic acid did not modify the inhibition of PLD by ceramides, indicating that the effect in the cell-free system was unlikely to be dependent upon a ceramide-stimulated kinase or phosphoprotein phosphatases. C2- and C8-ceramides prevented the GTPγS-induced translocation of ARF1 and RhoA from the cytosol to the membrane fraction. In whole cells, C2-ceramide, but not dihydro-C2-ceramide, inhibited the stimulation of PLD by N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine and decreased the amounts of ARF1, RhoA, CDC42, Rab4, and protein kinase C-α and -β1 that were associated with the membrane fraction, but did not alter the distribution of protein kinase C-ϵ and -ζ. It is concluded that one mechanism by which ceramides prevent the activation of PLD is inhibition of the translocation to membranes of G-proteins and protein kinase C isoforms that are required for PLD activity."

Recently, PMT has also been shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p125Fak and paxillin, as well as actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly (14Lacerda H.M. Lax A.J. Rozengurt E.

Pasteurella multocida toxin phospholipase C phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate pertussis toxin GTP-binding protein guanosine 5ʹ-O-(2-(thio)diphosphate). The reported mitogenic response caused by PMT on intact cells has been hypothesized to be the result of activation of a cellular phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC) (10Murphy A.C.

Accordingly, PMT-induced release of these second messengers was presumed to be responsible for initiation of subsequent signaling events, including stimulation of Ca2+ mobilization and activation of protein kinase C, respectively. There are a large number of different ligands and receptors that are known to activate PLC, causing release of IP3 and diacylglycerol from PIP2 (15Berridge M.J.

Receptor regulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis is generally considered to be mediated either through protein tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ or G-protein activation of PLC β-isoforms (15Berridge M.J.

It has been reported that PMT-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis could be blocked by the addition of GDPβS to permeabilized cells, but PMT does not increase tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ (10Murphy A.C. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25296-25303Google Scholar). PMT action may thus involve a G-protein-dependent PLC activity, such as PLCβ1, PLCβ2, or PLCβ3. The Xenopus oocyte is a useful model system for mechanistic studies of signal transduction pathways and has been used widely to study G-protein coupling to PLC (18Delisle S.

We used voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes to demonstrate direct PMT-mediated stimulation of PLC activity by monitoring the endogenous Ca2+-dependent Cl- current evoked upon microinjection with PMT. To identify the intracellular targets involved in the PMT-induced IP3 signaling pathway, we tested the effects of specific antibodies against Gpanα, Gq/11α (C-terminal and N-terminal), Gi/o/t/zα, Gi-1/i-2/i-3α isoforms, Gs/olfα, Gpanβ (C-terminal, internal, and N-terminal), PLCβ1, PLCβ2, PLCβ3, PLCγ1, an N-terminal peptide of PMT (toxA28-42), or a C-terminal peptide of PMT (toxA1239-1253) on the PMT-induced Cl- currents. We also examined the effects of PT on the PMT response. Our results established the direct involvement of the free, monomeric Gqα protein in PMT activation of PLCβ1. The specific role of Gqα was further confirmed by over- and underexpression of mouse Gqα in Xenopus oocytes. Rabbit polyclonal antisera against two synthetic peptides, comprising residues 28-42 of PMT (NSDFTVKGKSADEIF) and residues 1239-1253 of PMT (PVDDWALEIAQRNRA), were obtained from Bio-Synthesis, Inc., using multiple antigen peptide conjugation methodology. The anti-peptide IgG antibodies (anti-toxA28-42 and anti-toxA1239-1253) were purified using a protein A-agarose column (PURE-1, Sigma). Rabbit antibodies against the unique C terminus of the α subunit of Gq/11 (anti-Gq/11α, QL) and against the common internal GTP-binding site of the α subunit of G-proteins (anti-Gpanα, GA/1) were obtained from DuPont NEN. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the α subunits of Gs/olf (anti-Gs/olfα, C-terminal, C-18, 377-394), Gq/11 (anti-Gq/11α, N-terminal, E-17, 13-29), and Gi/o/t/z (anti-Gi/o/t/zα, C-terminal, C-20, 325-344), the 1-4 Gβ subunit isoforms (anti-Gpanβ, C-terminal, T-20, 321-340), the 1-4 Gβ subunit isoforms (anti-Gpanβ, N-terminal, M-14, 1-14), PLCβ1 (anti-PLCβ1, C-terminal, G-12, 1204-1216), PLCβ2 (anti-PLCβ2, C-terminal, Q-15, 1170-1181), PLCβ3 (anti-PLCβ3, C-terminal, C-20, 1198-1217), and PLCγ1 (anti-PLCγ1, internal, 530-850) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the α subunits of Gi-1 (anti-Gi-1α, internal, 159-168), Gi-1/i-2 (anti-Gi-1/i-2α, C-terminal, 345-354), Gi-3 (anti-Gi-3α, C-terminal, 345-354), and the 1-4 Gβ subunit isoforms (anti-Gpanβ, internal, 127-139) were obtained from Calbiochem, Inc. Goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, were obtained from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. Pertussis toxin (PT) catalytic S1 subunit was purchased from List Biological Laboratories, Inc. IP3 and GDPβS were purchased from Sigma. Native PMT was purchased from Sigma as a lyophilized powder with BSA and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol, prior to use. Native PMT, purified to homogeneity, quantified and titered by Vero cell cytotoxicity assays as described (51Chrisp C.E. Foged N.T. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1991; 52: 56-61Google Scholar), was also obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Clarence Chrisp. Both toxin samples gave comparable responses in oocyte experiments, although the highly purified sample was approximately 20-fold more active, and the concentration of the sample was adjusted to reflect this difference (data not shown). Anti-toxA28-42 and anti-toxA1239-1253 were reactive with both toxin samples in Western blots, and anti-toxA28-42 specifically inhibited the activities of both toxin samples in oocyte experiments. Complementary DNA coding for mouse Gq protein α subunit in the pcDNAI cloning vector (5.4 kilobases) was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Petra Schnabel. The plasmid containing the cDNA insert was linearized by digestion with the restriction enzyme ApaI (Life Technologies, Inc.). Using the Ampliscribe Transcription System (Epicentre Technologies, Inc.), sense cRNA was transcribed by the T7 promoter and antisense cRNA by the SP6 promoter, according to the manufacturer's procedure. In vitro transcriptions of the cRNA were performed in the presence of methylated cap (m7G[5ʹ]ppp[5ʹ]G) and catalyzed by T7 or SP6 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively, at 370C for 2 h. In vitro transcribed cRNA was dissolved in RNase-free water at a final concentration of 1 ng/nl. Adult female Xenopus laevis frogs (Xenopus I, Michigan) were anesthetized by immersion in a 0.15% tricaine methanesulfonate (Ayerst) solution for 30 min. A small incision was made on one side of the abdomen to remove several ovarian lobes. The lobes were gently torn apart and immersed in a Ca2+-free OR-2 solution (100 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM Hepes-Tris, pH 7.5). Oocytes were defolliculated by incubation with 2 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma, type 1A) at room temperature (22-240C) for 2-3 h. The oocytes were then washed five times with OR-2 solution and five times with a modified Barth's solution (88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 2.4 mM NaHCO3, 0.3 mM Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 100 μg/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Stage 5-6 oocytes were selected and stored at 180C in modified Barth's solution. Two microelectrodes, made by a horizontal puller (PD-5, Narishige) and filled with 3 M KCl to give a resistance of 1.5-2.0 megaohms, were used for voltage clamping. Voltage clamp experiments were performed in a continuously perfused bath (10 ml/min) at room temperature (220C). The bath was connected through an Ag-AgCl-Agar-3 M-KCl bridge to the voltage-recording amplifier (Axoclamp 2A, Axon Instruments). The data were filtered with a four-pole Bessel filter at 500 Hz. Voltage pulse protocols and data acquisition were performed on a 486 IBM computer with pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments), and graphics were obtained using Origin software (Microcal) with a pCLAMP module. Membrane currents were measured in normal Ringer's solution (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 11.8 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4), or where indicated, in Ca2+-free Ringer's solution (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4). Microinjections of toxins, antibodies, and other reagents were performed under voltage-clamp conditions at -80 mV holding potential using a pulse-controlled picoliter injector (Dagan model PMI200). Toxins and other reagents were prepared in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, or 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, prior to injection. In all oocytes tested, if a stable membrane potential could be achieved, PMT always elicited a response. However, rarely, an entire group of oocytes from a particular donor gave only a very weak response to PMT, upon which the entire group of oocytes was discarded, and the responses were not included in the data analysis; oocytes from that donor were not used again. In all experiments reported here, injection of PMT into control, untreated oocytes gave detectable responses. In a number of cases, a group of oocytes from a particular donor elicited robust responses to PMT, of which several oocytes would give extremely large responses (exceeding the detection limits of the instrument), and the responses from these oocytes were also not included in the data analysis. The number of oocytes used for data analysis is given in parentheses in the figure legends, and the total number of oocytes tested, including those giving overwhelming (but not those giving weak) responses, is indicated in brackets. All results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. or the mean ± S.E. (as indicated in the figure legends) of the responses assayed in oocytes from at least two different donors (except where indicated), with N denoting the number of groups tested and n denoting the number of oocytes tested in each group. To evaluate the statistical significance of the results, p values were determined for each group using the two-ended t test with unequal variance. Oocytes that were not injected with cRNA are referred to throughout this communication as normal oocytes. In the experiments over- or underexpressing Gqα, the oocytes were injected with in vitro transcribed cRNA (50 ng) by positive displacement using a 10-μl micropipetter 2 days prior to the electrophysiological experiments. Because of the large response observed in the oocytes overexpressing Gqα, the amount of PMT was decreased to 0.1 ng/oocyte. Even at this dose, it was frequently observed that the peak inward current exceeded the instrument's recording range (similar to that shown in Fig. 2B, lower trace). Consequently, only those groups of oocytes showing a moderate increase (up to ∼800 nA, similar to that shown in Fig. 5A, lower trace) in the peak current upon injecting the reduced PMT dose were arbitrarily selected for the antibody studies. The total number of oocytes tested, including those giving overwhelming responses (all oocytes gave a response), is denoted in brackets in the figure legends.Fig. 5The effect of specific antibodies to key signal transduction proteins potentially involved in PMT action in Xenopus oocytes overexpressing mouse Gqα. Experiments were performed as described in Fig. 3, Bars, S. E.

The optimal preincubation period for oocytes with each antibody prior to toxin injection was determined to be 2-4 h (data not shown). Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of undiluted antibody 3 h prior to injection with PMT. Anti-toxA28-42, diluted to a concentration that could neutralize the PMT effect in normal oocytes, as determined by titration (Fig. 1B), were used for co-injection with PMT. Anti-toxA1239-1253 was used at the same concentration as anti-toxA28-42. Each individual oocyte was solubilized in lysis buffer, containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by the addition of 2 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. The mixture was heated at 950C for 10 min, and the entire contents of each oocyte were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was immunoblotted first with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Gqα, revealing a major band due to Gqα (data not shown), then with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to RhoA (Fig. 5C), revealing an additional band due to RhoA and an unidentified higher molecular weight band at Mr∼60,000. The blots were developed using secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Xenopus oocytes clamped at negative holding potentials (-80 mV) produced an inward current when microinjected with the 146.3-kDa protein toxin from P. multocida (Fig. 1A). Examination of the activation of the current showed that it was characteristic of the IP3-mediated Ca2+-dependent Cl- conductance, exhibiting two components: an initial faster peak current I1 in response to mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ pools; and a second, slower and larger peak current I2 caused by Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels on the plasma membrane. Pre-incubation of PMT with polyclonal antibodies against a 15-amino acid synthetic peptide from the N-terminal region of PMT (anti-toxA28-42) prevented the response (Fig. 1B), as did heat inactivation of the toxin (Fig. 1A), demonstrating the specificity of the PMT-induced response and the importance of the N terminus of PMT in its action. Similar preincubation of PMT with polyclonal antibodies against a 15-amino acid peptide from the C-terminal region of PMT (anti-toxA1239-1253) had no effect on the PMT response (statistical analysis included in Fig. 3A). To confirm that the PMT-induced Cl- currents were indeed Ca2+-dependent, the effects of removing extracellular Ca2+ and applying specific blockers of Ca2+ and Cl- channels on the PMT-induced currents were examined (Fig. 1C). For the IP3 response, it has been shown that removal of extracellular Ca2+ or blockage of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel by Cd2+ will abolish I2, but not I1, whereas induction of both I1 and I2 can be blocked by intracellular chelation of Ca2+ with EGTA or by anion transport inhibitors of Cl- channels, such as anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (51Chrisp C.E. Foged N.T. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1991; 52: 56-61Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, injection of PMT into oocytes bathed in Ca2+-free solution induced only I1, whereas I2 was not observed. Likewise, when the Ca2+-channel blocker Cd2+ was present at 1 mM concentration in the medium, I2 was diminished. Both I1 and I2 were inhibited if PMT was co-injected with EGTA or if anthracene-9-carboxylic acid was perfused in the bath solution. The overall effect of microinjecting PMT on the voltage-clamped oocytes was direct and almost immediate, occurring within 20 s from microinjection. An EC50 value of 0.28 ng/oocyte for PMT (for the Sigma sample) in normal oocytes was determined from the dose-response curve in Fig. 2A. Contrary to what was observed for multiple IP3 injections (Fig. 2B, upper trace), after the first injection with PMT in normal oocytes, additional injection with PMT gave little or no further response (Fig. 2B, middle trace), suggesting that the action of PMT is not readily reversible. For oocytes unable to elicit a response to a second dose of PMT, additional injection of IP3 in the same oocyte was still able to evoke both I1 and I2. In Gqα-overexpressing oocytes, even at 20-fold less PMT doses, the initial injection elicited an overwhelming response (Fig. 2B, lower trace), more than 15 times that observed for normal oocytes (i.e. ≫300-fold more potent). After the first injection, a second dose of PMT elicited a greatly diminished response (Fig. 2B, lower trace inset). Despite numerous attempts, it was not technically possible to perform a subsequent IP3 injection in oocytes showing an overwhelming effect of PMT. Specific antibodies against each of the PLC isoforms, β1, β2, β3, or γ1, were microinjected into normal oocytes 3 h prior to microinjection with PMT. Antibodies against PLCγ1 and PLCβ2 did not block (p ≫ 0.4 for both) the Ca2+-dependent Cl- current induced by PMT; in fact, anti-PLCβ2 appeared to cause a 25%"
https://openalex.org/W2125182057,"We recently showed that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) defines a unique subclass of nuclear receptors that exist in solution and bind DNA elements as homodimers (Jiang, G., Nepomuceno, L., Hopkins, K., and Sladek, F. M. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 5131-5143). In this study, we show that the dimerization domains of HNF-4 map to both the DNA binding and the ligand binding domain. Whereas the latter is critical for dimerization in solution, the DNA binding domain mediates cooperative, specific binding to direct repeats of AGGTCA separated by one or two nucleotides. Whereas amino acid residues 117-125 (the T-box/third helix region) are insufficient for cooperative homodimerization and high affinity DNA binding, residues 126-142 (encompassing the A-box region) are required. Finally, in contrast to the full-length receptor, the DNA binding domain of HNF-4 is capable of heterodimerizing with that of the retinoid X receptor α but not with that of other receptors. These results indicate that the HNF-4 DNA binding domain is distinct from that of other receptors and that the determinants that prevent HNF-4 from heterodimerizing with RXR lie outside the DNA binding domain, presumably in the ligand binding domain.

INTRODUCTIONDimerization plays an important role in the function of many different types of proteins. From extracellular receptors to nuclear proteins, the ability to dimerize adds diversity as well as specificity to a variety of biological pathways. This is particularly true for the superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. This family of soluble, nuclear receptors contains over 150 members, including the steroid, thyroid hormone, vitamin A, and vitamin D receptors, and an even larger number of orphan receptors for which ligands have not yet been identified (23Kurokawa R. Yu V. Naar A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M. Glass C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Google Scholar).The nuclear receptor superfamily is characterized by two highly conserved domains. The DNA binding domain (DBD), 1The abbreviations used are: DBDDNA binding domainHNF-4hepatocyte nuclear factor 4RXRretinoid X receptorTRthyroid hormone receptorLBDligand binding domainEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift analysiswtwild-typePCRpolymerase chain reactionRTroom temperatureRARretinoic acid receptor. in the N-terminal half of the protein, consists of approximately 60-90 amino acids that form two zinc finger modules followed by a C-terminal extension. The so-called ligand binding domain (LBD) in the C-terminal half of the protein consists of approximately 200 amino acids. This region performs a variety of functions including transactivation, ligand binding, and protein dimerization via heptad repeats of hydrophobic residues (7Zechel C. Shen X. Chen J. Chen Z. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1425-1433Google Scholar, 8Zechel C. Shen X. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1414-1424Google Scholar, 23Kurokawa R. Yu V. Naar A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M. Glass C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Google Scholar).With a few exceptions, the nuclear receptors all have the capacity to bind DNA as dimers. Several, particularly those related to the retinoid receptors, also bind DNA preferentially as heterodimers. Retinoid X receptor (RXR) is the most promiscuous of the receptors, dimerizing with at least 10 different receptors on a variety of DNA elements (23Kurokawa R. Yu V. Naar A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M. Glass C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Google Scholar). Full-length RXR, in fact, binds DNA only poorly as a homodimer and not at all as a monomer (42Thompson C.C. Weinberger C. Lebo R. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 1610-1614Google Scholar).Dimerization domains in the receptors have been localized to both the DBD and the LBD using mutagenesis studies (5Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Google Scholar, 7Zechel C. Shen X. Chen J. Chen Z. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1425-1433Google Scholar, 8Zechel C. Shen X. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Lebo R. Gruol D.J. Evans R.M. Nature. 1986; 324: 641-646Google Scholar). Dimerization interfaces have also been visualized in the three-dimensional structures of homo- and heterodimeric complexes of DBDs of various receptors bound to DNA: a homodimer of the estrogen receptor (30Glass C. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407Google Scholar), a homodimer of the glucocorticoid receptor (21Perlmann T. Rangarajan P. Umesono K. Evans R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Google Scholar), and a heterodimer of RXRα and the thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ) (28Blanchard K.L. Acquaviva A.M. Galson D.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5373-5385Google Scholar). The structure of a homodimer of the LBD of RXRα, in the absence of ligand, has also been solved and shown to contain a dimerization interface (3Forman B.M. Yan C.-R. Au M. Casanova J. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1610-1626Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the precise role of the different dimerization motifs in DNA binding and other receptor functions has not been clearly defined.Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) is a highly conserved receptor essential for development in organisms ranging from insect to man (4Zhang X.-K. Pfahl M. Receptor. 1993; 3: 183-191Google Scholar, 34Spanjaard R.A. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8587-8591Google Scholar, 44Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 183-188Google Scholar). Found predominantly in the liver, kidney, and intestine, HNF-4 transcriptionally activates a wide variety of genes including those involved in fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism, glucose metabolism, urea biosynthesis, blood coagulation, hepatitis B infections, and liver differentiation (reviewed in 32Linstedt A. West N. Brenner R. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 24: 677-686Google Scholar, 33Rodriguez R. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. Schrader W.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1782-1790Google Scholar). A ligand, however, has not yet been identified for HNF-4. (The term ligand binding domain (LBD), however, will be used for the sake of consistency with other receptors.)We recently showed that HNF-4, while very similar in DNA binding specificity and amino acid sequence to RXRα, does not heterodimerize with full-length RXR or any other receptor analyzed. In fact, full-length HNF-4 bound DNA only as a homodimer and sedimented as a homodimer during glycerol gradient centrifugation. The strong homodimerization activity, as well as the exclusively nuclear localization of HNF-4, led us to conclude that HNF-4 defines a new subclass of receptors (12Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Google Scholar).In this study, we analyze in greater detail the mechanism of dimerization of HNF-4 with the goal of deciphering the role and the determinants of homo- versus heterodimerization among the nuclear receptors. The dimerization domains of HNF-4 are localized to both the DBD and the LBD, and the DBD is shown to mediate cooperative, high affinity, specific binding to DNA. The LBD, in contrast, appears to be important for dimerization in solution. It is also shown that, in contrast, to the full-length receptor, the HNF-4 DBD is capable of heterodimerizing with the DBD of RXRα, although not with the DBDs of the retinoid acid receptor α (RARα) or thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ). These results confirm the unique nature of HNF-4 and implicate the LBD as the major determinant of homo- versus heterodimerization of HNF-4.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study show that the DNA binding domain (DBD) of HNF-4 readily heterodimerizes with the DBD of RXRα. The results also show that the A-box region at the C-terminal end of the DBD is critical for the cooperative homodimerization and thus high affinity binding of HNF-4 DBD to DNA. Finally, this is the first report of direct evidence that HNF-4 binds DR2 elements as well as DR1 elements. Although HNF-4 has been previously shown to bind native elements comprised of nonconsensus half-sites separated by two nucleotides (2Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 953-962Google Scholar, 25Hard T. Kellenbach E. Boelens R. Kaptein R. Dahlman K. Carlstedt-Duke J. Freedman L.P. Maler B.A. Hyde E.I. Gustafsson J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9015-9023Google Scholar), this is the first published report of HNF-4 binding a synthetic DR2 element.Determinants of Exclusive Homodimerization of HNF-4 Reside within the LBDIn contrast to the full-length HNF-4 which exists in solution as a stable homodimer and binds DNA only as a homodimer (12Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Google Scholar), the HNF-4 DBD exists in solution as a monomer (Fig. 3, Fig. 4B) and efficiently heterodimerizes with the DBD of RXRα (Fig. 8). These results demonstrate that the determinants responsible for the exclusive homodimerization of HNF-4 reside outside the DBD, presumably in the LBD.The conclusion that the LBD is crucial in mediating the exclusive homodimerization activity of HNF-4 both in solution and on DNA is not too surprising since the LBD is known to be important in determining the homo- and heterodimerization properties of other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (reviewed in 10Schwabe J. Chapman L. Finch J. Rhodes D. Cell. 1993; 75: 567-578Google Scholar). For instance, the DBDs of the steroid hormone receptors (i.e. estrogen and glucocorticoid) exist in solution as monomers even at millimolar concentrations (11Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freeman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Google Scholar, 31Wrange O. Eriksson P. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5253-5259Google Scholar), whereas the full-length receptors exist in solution as homodimers (7Zechel C. Shen X. Chen J. Chen Z. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1425-1433Google Scholar, 20Kaufman R. Davies M. Pathak V. Hershey J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Google Scholar, 29Nakshatri H. Chambon P. J. Biol.

Mutations in the LBD, especially the conserved ninth heptad region, have also been shown to change the homo- and/or heterodimerization properties of nuclear receptors such as TR, RAR, and RXR (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Google Scholar, 35Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B. Samuels H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5725-5737Google Scholar, 43Weinberger C. Thompson C.C. Ong E.S. Lebo R. Gruol D.J. Evans R.M. Nature. 1986; 324: 641-646Google Scholar). However, this is the first example of a DBD of a receptor forming heterodimers when the corresponding full-length receptor forms only homodimers. These results unequivocally implicate the LBD in determining homo- versus heterodimerization of HNF-4. Indeed, the crystal structure of a dimer of the LBD of RXRα shows important contacts between amino acids of opposite charge from each of the two monomers at the dimer interface (3Forman B.M. Yan C.-R. Au M. Casanova J. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1610-1626Google Scholar). Finally, since HNF-4 defines a new subclass of nuclear receptors (12Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Google Scholar), we propose that the determinants of the strong homodimerization activity of other receptors that fall into that group, such as germ cell nuclear factor and TAK1, will also reside within the LBD.HNF-4 DBD Possesses Unique Structural and Functional PropertiesOf all the mammalian nuclear receptors, HNF-4 is most similar to RXR in amino acid sequence, especially in the DBD (17Sladek F.M. Receptor. 1993; 3: 223-232Google Scholar). Mouse RXRα is 56% identical to rat HNF-4 in the DBD. HNF-4 and RXRα also share response elements from at least six different genes as well as a consensus site of a direct repeat of AGGTCA separated by one nucleotide (DR1) (reviewed in 32Linstedt A. West N. Brenner R. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 24: 677-686Google Scholar, 33Rodriguez R. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. Schrader W.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1782-1790Google Scholar). These similarities suggested that the structural and functional properties of the HNF-4 DBD would be similar to that of the RXRα DBD. The results from this study show, however, that this is not the case.First, the A- and the T-boxes appear to play different roles in the homodimerization of the HNF-4 and the RXRα DBDs. For example, the A-box is required for the cooperative homodimerization of the HNF-4 DBD (Fig. 6, Fig. 7), whereas the T-box is necessary and sufficient for the cooperative homodimerization of the RXRα DBD (18Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 207-230Google Scholar, 40de The H. Marchio A. Tiollais P. Dejean A. Nature. 1987; 330: 667-670Google Scholar, 41Giguere V. Shago M. Zirngibl R. Tate P. Rossant J. Varmuza S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2335-2340Google Scholar). Second, the DBD of HNF-4 heterodimerizes with the RXRα DBD but not with the RAR or the TR DBD, suggesting that the HNF-4 DBD is more like the RAR or the TR DBD than the RXRα DBD (Fig. 8 and data not shown).Since the HNF-4 DBD construct containing the A-box (HNF4.142) dimerizes cooperatively with the HNF-4 DBD construct lacking the A-box (HNF4.125), which by itself does not readily homodimerize (Fig. 6), it is concluded that the dimerization interface of the HNF-4 DBD homodimer is formed through the interaction between the A-box of one HNF-4 DBD and a more N-terminal region of the other HNF-4 DBD. This asymmetric nature of the HNF-4 DBD dimerization interface is consistent with arrangement of the two half-sites of the HNF-4 binding site as a direct repeat.The finding that the A-box region is required for the cooperative homodimerization of the HNF-4 DBD on DNA is rather unique among nuclear receptors studied (see Table II). Although the A-box has been shown to be important for the monomeric binding of NGFI-B and TR (16Chen W. Manova K. Weinstein D. Duncan S. Plump A. Prezioso V. Bachvarova R. Darnell J.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Google Scholar, 38Leid M. Kastner P. Lyons R. Nakshatri H. Saunders M. Zacharewski T. Chen J.-Y. Staub A. Garnier J.-M. Mader S. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 68: 377-395Google Scholar), it has been shown to not be critical for the homo- and heterodimerization of RXR and RAR DBDs, for which the T-box is more important (28Blanchard K.L. Acquaviva A.M. Galson D.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5373-5385Google Scholar, 40de The H. Marchio A. Tiollais P. Dejean A. Nature. 1987; 330: 667-670Google Scholar, 41Giguere V. Shago M. Zirngibl R. Tate P. Rossant J. Varmuza S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2335-2340Google Scholar). The A-box, however, was shown to be important for the high affinity binding of the TR homodimer (16Chen W. Manova K. Weinstein D. Duncan S. Plump A. Prezioso V. Bachvarova R. Darnell J.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Google Scholar). It thus appears that HNF-4 DBD homodimer functions in a manner similar to a TR DBD homodimer even though it is much more similar to the RXRα DBD in amino acid sequence, particularly in the T-box region. This similarity, however, is unexpected since HNF-4 and TR homodimers bind direct repeats with different spacings. Whereas HNF-4 binds both DR1 and DR2 elements, TR binds DR4 elements as well as inverted repeats. And binding of receptor dimers to direct repeats with different spacings are expected to involve dimerization interfaces formed between different regions of the receptors (28Blanchard K.L. Acquaviva A.M. Galson D.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5373-5385Google Scholar).Table II.Requirement for the A-box in DNA bindingMonomerHomodimerHeterodimeraHeterodimerization with RXR.RXRNoNoNot applicableRARNoNoNoTRYesYesYesHNF-4NoYesNoa Heterodimerization with RXR. Open table in a new tab Despite the similar role of the A-box in HNF-4 and TR DBD homodimerization, other evidence suggests that the structure of HNF-4 DBD is different from that of the TR DBD. First, the A-box plays apparently different roles in the monomeric binding of the HNF-4 DBD and the TR DBD. Whereas the A-box is absolutely required for the monomeric binding of TR DBD (41Giguere V. Shago M. Zirngibl R. Tate P. Rossant J. Varmuza S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2335-2340Google Scholar), it appears to facilitate but is not necessary for the monomeric binding of HNF-4 DBD (Fig. 6). Second, the A-box of TR is required for heterodimerization with RXR but it is not required for heterodimerization of the HNF-4 DBD (Fig. 8). Third, structural modeling indicates that the A-box of the TR DBD will interfere with the second zinc module of RXR DBD on DR1 and DR2 elements and therefore prevent the two DBDs from heterodimerizing on those elements (28Blanchard K.L. Acquaviva A.M. Galson D.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5373-5385Google Scholar). In contrast, the HNF-4 DBD construct containing the A-box (HNF4.142) heterodimerizes with the RXRα DBD on DR2 (Fig. 8B). Potential steric hindrance could, however, explain why the same HNF-4 DBD construct does not heterodimerize with RXR.DBD on DR1 whereas the HNF-4 DBD construct lacking the A-box (HNF4.125) does (Fig. 8A).In conclusion, the results of this study show not only that the determinants of homo- versus heterodimerization reside within the LBD of the receptors but also that much remains to be learned about the role of the A-box and the T-box in the nuclear receptors. Furthermore, the results indicate that the dimerization interface of HNF-4 DBD is different from that of other nuclear receptors, which could explain why HNF-4, which binds DR1 and DR2, has a different DNA binding specificity than that of other receptors, including RXR, TR, and RAR, which preferentially bind DR1, DR4, and DR5, respectively. Finally, this study provides yet another example of how broad functional diversity among proteins within a highly conserved superfamily can be achieved with a minimal amount of alteration in primary amino acid sequence. INTRODUCTIONDimerization plays an important role in the function of many different types of proteins. From extracellular receptors to nuclear proteins, the ability to dimerize adds diversity as well as specificity to a variety of biological pathways. This is particularly true for the superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors.

The so-called ligand binding domain (LBD) in the C-terminal half of the protein consists of approximately 200 amino acids. This region performs a variety of functions including transactivation, ligand binding, and protein dimerization via heptad repeats of hydrophobic residues (7Zechel C. Shen X. Chen J. Chen Z.

Dimerization interfaces have also been visualized in the three-dimensional structures of homo- and heterodimeric complexes of DBDs of various receptors bound to DNA: a homodimer of the estrogen receptor (30Glass C. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407Google Scholar), a homodimer of the glucocorticoid receptor (21Perlmann T. Rangarajan P. Umesono K. Evans R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Google Scholar), and a heterodimer of RXRα and the thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ) (28Blanchard K.L. Acquaviva A.M. Galson D.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5373-5385Google Scholar). The structure of a homodimer of the LBD of RXRα, in the absence of ligand, has also been solved and shown to contain a dimerization interface (3Forman B.M. Yan C.-R. Au M. Casanova J. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1610-1626Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the precise role of the different dimerization motifs in DNA binding and other receptor functions has not been clearly defined.Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) is a highly conserved receptor essential for development in organisms ranging from insect to man (4Zhang X.-K. Pfahl M. Receptor. 1993; 3: 183-191Google Scholar, 34Spanjaard R.A. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8587-8591Google Scholar, 44Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 183-188Google Scholar). Found predominantly in the liver, kidney, and intestine, HNF-4 transcriptionally activates a wide variety of genes including those involved in fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism, glucose metabolism, urea biosynthesis, blood coagulation, hepatitis B infections, and liver differentiation (reviewed in 32Linstedt A. West N. Brenner R. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 24: 677-686Google Scholar, 33Rodriguez R. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. Schrader W.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1782-1790Google Scholar). A ligand, however, has not yet been identified for HNF-4. (The term ligand binding domain (LBD), however, will be used for the sake of consistency with other receptors.)We recently showed that HNF-4, while very similar in DNA binding specificity and amino acid sequence to RXRα, does not heterodimerize with full-length RXR or any other receptor analyzed. In fact, full-length HNF-4 bound DNA only as a homodimer and sedimented as a homodimer during glycerol gradient centrifugation. The strong homodimerization activity, as well as the exclusively nuclear localization of HNF-4, led us to conclude that HNF-4 defines a new subclass of receptors (12Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Google Scholar).In this study, we analyze in greater detail the mechanism of dimerization of HNF-4 with the goal of deciphering the role and the determinants of homo- versus heterodimerization among the nuclear receptors. The dimerization domains of HNF-4 are localized to both the DBD and the LBD, and the DBD is shown to mediate cooperative, high affinity, specific binding to DNA. The LBD, in contrast, appears to be important for dimerization in solution. It is also shown that, in contrast, to the full-length receptor, the HNF-4 DBD is capable of heterodimerizing with the DBD of RXRα, although not with the DBDs of the retinoid acid receptor α (RARα) or thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ). These results confirm the unique nature of HNF-4 and implicate the LBD as the major determinant of homo- versus heterodimerization of HNF-4. Dimerization plays an important role in the function of many different types of proteins. From extracellular receptors to nuclear proteins, the ability to dimerize adds diversity as well as specificity to a variety of biological pathways. This is particularly true for the superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. This family of soluble, nuclear receptors contains over 150 members, including the steroid, thyroid hormone, vitamin A, and vitamin D receptors, and an even larger number of orphan receptors for which ligands have not yet been identified (23Kurokawa R. Yu V. Naar A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M. Glass C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Google Scholar). The nuclear receptor superfamily is characterized by two highly conserved domains. The DNA binding domain (DBD), 1The abbreviations used are: DBDDNA binding domainHNF-4hepatocyte nuclear factor 4RXRretinoid X receptorTRthyroid hormone receptorLBDligand binding domainEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift analysiswtwild-typePCRpolymerase chain reactionRTroom temperatureRARretinoic acid receptor. in the N-terminal half of the protein, consists of approximately 60-90 amino acids that form two zinc finger modules followed by a C-terminal extension. The so-called ligand binding domain (LBD) in the C-terminal half of the protein consists of approximately 200 amino acids. This region performs a variety of functions including transactivation, ligand binding, and protein dimerization via heptad repeats of hydrophobic residues (7Zechel C. Shen X. Chen J. Chen Z. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1425-1433Google Scholar, 8Zechel C. Shen X. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1414-1424Google Scholar, 23Kurokawa R. Yu V. Naar A. Kyakumoto S.

With a few exceptions, the nuclear receptors all have the capacity to bind DNA as dimers. Several, particularly those related to the retinoid receptors, also bind DNA preferentially as heterodimers. Retinoid X receptor (RXR) is the most promiscuous of the receptors, dimerizing with at least 10 different receptors on a variety of DNA elements (23Kurokawa R. Yu V. Naar A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M. Glass C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Google Scholar). Full-length RXR, in fact, binds DNA only poorly as a homodimer and not at all as a monomer (42Thompson C.C. Weinberger C. Lebo R. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 1610-1614Google Scholar). Dimerization domains in the receptors have been localized to both the DBD and the LBD using mutagenesis studies (5Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Google Scholar, 7Zechel C. Shen X. Chen J.

TLN on the surface of telencephalic neurons may be a target molecule in the brain for LFA-1-expressing microglia and leukocytes in physiological or pathological conditions. The most conspicuous feature of the human brain lies in its highly developed, enormously enlarged, and elaborated telencephalon (1Swanson L.W. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 471-474Google Scholar). The telencephalon is the most rostral brain segment, which includes the cerebral neocortex, olfactory cortex, hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, septum, and olfactory bulb. These telencephalic regions take charge of higher brain functions such as memory, learning, emotion, sensory perception, and voluntary movements. Telencephalin (TLN) 1The abbreviations used are: TLNtelencephalinICAMintercellular adhesion moleculeLFA-1lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1VCAM-1vascular cell adhesion molecule-1MAdCAM-1mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1FISHfluorescence in situ hybridizationPCRpolymerase chain reactionmAbmonoclonal antibodyPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. is a cell surface glycoprotein whose expression is confined exclusively within the telencephalon (2Mori K.

Mori K. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 21: 119-124Google Scholar). TLN is expressed by subsets of the telencephalic neurons, but not by glial cells. In the neurons, TLN is localized to soma-dendritic membrane, but not to axonal membrane. In the course of brain development, TLN first appears around birth when the dendritic outgrowth and branching, spine formation, and synapse formation occur in the telencephalic regions. Afterwards, TLN expression persists even in adult animals. These unique expression patterns of TLN in brain segment-, neuronal subsets-, soma-dendritic membrane-, and developmental stage-specific fashions suggest that TLN may be a crucial cell surface molecule for the formation, maintenance, and plasticity of neuronal networks in the brain (2Mori K.

Although there exist several members of the Ig superfamily that are expressed in brain region- and neuronal type-specific manners, such as limbic system-associated membrane protein (LAMP) (8Pimenta A.F.

Of all the Ig superfamily molecules so far identified, the structure of TLN is most closely related to those of intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs)-1 and −3. The NH2-terminal Ig-like domain of TLN contains four cysteine residues that are capable of forming two intradomain disulfide bridges. Similarly spaced cysteine residues in the NH2-terminal Ig-like domains are seen in a unique subgroup of the Ig superfamily, such as ICAM-1 (14Simmons D. Makgova M.W. Seed B.

The TLN/LFA-1 binding provides a basis for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying cell-cell interactions between telencephalic neurons and LFA-1-expressing microglia or leukocytes. We used a PCR-based strategy for cDNA cloning of human TLN. Two degenerate oligonucleotides (5′-acigti(ac)gigtigc(acgt)gg(acgt)cc(acgt)tggct(acgt)tgg-3′ and 5′-cciccigcicc(ag)tt(acgt)ag(ag)ca(acgt)ac(acgt)gc(ct)tc-3′) corresponding to the amino acid sequences TVRVAGPWLW and EAVCLNGAGG (Fig. 1, dashed underlines) that are completely conserved between mouse and rabbit TLN (7Yoshihara Y. Oka S. Nemoto Y. Watanabe Y. Nagata S. Kagamiyama H. Mori K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 541-553Google Scholar) were synthesized and used as primers in PCR with human cerebral neocortex cDNA as a template. PCR was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Japan) under the following condition: 96°C for 1 min, 55°C for 2 min, 72°C for 2 min for 40 cycles, then 72°C for 3 min. The PCR product (186 base pairs) was directly cloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen, Netherlands) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Amersham, United Kingdom). To obtain full-length cDNA for human TLN, an unamplified human cerebral neocortex λgt11 cDNA library (9 × 105 recombinant phages) was screened with the 32P-labeled PCR product (186 base pairs) as a probe. Twelve clones were randomly selected from the 50 positives of the first screening, isolated, and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Restriction mapping and partial sequencing revealed that all 12 clones were derived from the same gene. The complete DNA sequence was determined for both strands of the longest clone hTLN-#12. Equal amounts of total RNA from human hippocampus and cerebellum were size-fractionated in 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham, UK). An ApaI fragment (828 base pairs, residues 507-1334) of human TLN cDNA was 32P-labeled with a random priming kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and used as a probe. Hybridization, washing, and visualization were performed as described previously (7Yoshihara Y. Oka S. Nemoto Y. Watanabe Y. Nagata S. Kagamiyama H. Mori K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 541-553Google Scholar). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was carried out as described (20Bailly P. Tontti E. Hermand P. Cartron J.P. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3316-3320Google Scholar). In brief, human (pro)metaphase chromosomes were prepared from normal male lymphocytes using the thymidine synchronization, BrdU release technique for the delineation of G-bands. Before hybridization, chromosomes were stained in Hoechst 33258 and irradiated with UV. A 3.0-kilobase pair full-length cDNA of the human TLN was labeled with biotin-16-dUTP by nick translation and hybridized to the denatured chromosome slides at a final concentration of 25 ng/μl in a mixture of 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate (Sigma), 2 × SSC, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (2 μg/μl), and Escherichia coli tRNA (2 μg/μl). The hybridization signals were detected with FITC-avidin (Boehringer Mannheim), and chromosomes were counterstained with propidium iodide (1 μg/ml). The precise signal position was determined by the delineation of G-banding patterns. Recombinant soluble Fc-chimeric proteins were produced essentially as described (27Simmons D.L. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 93-127Google Scholar). Briefly, for preparation of human TLN/Fc protein, the mammalian expression plasmids were constructed with the human TLN cDNA encoding the extracellular region (a signal peptide and distal five or nine Ig-like domains) and the human IgG1 gene Fc region (28Nishimura Y. Yokoyama M. Araki K. Ueda R. Kudo A. Watanabe T. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 999-1005Google Scholar) in pEF-BOS (29Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Google Scholar). The chimeric proteins (hTLN(1-5)/Fc and hTLN(1-9)/Fc) were produced in COS7 cells by the standard DEAE-dextran transfection method and purified from culture supernatants using a protein A-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). Human ICAM-1/Fc, rat BIG-1/Fc, rat BIG-2/Fc, and signal peptide/Fc (SP/Fc) were prepared by similar procedures. Cell adhesion assay was performed essentially as described (30Holeness C.L. Bates P.A. Littler A.J. Buckley C.D. McDowall A. Bossy D. Hogg N. Simmons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 877-884Google Scholar). Immulon-3 96-well plastic plates (Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were coated with 1 μg/well goat anti-human Fc IgG (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4°C, blocked with 0.4% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature, and then incubated with Fc-chimeric proteins in 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM MgCl2 for at least 2 h at room temperature. The HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. Prior to the adhesion assay, the cells were labeled for 12-24 h with [3H]thymidine at 10 μCi/1 × 106 cells, harvested, and washed three times with the assay medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum) prewarmed at 37°C. In order to increase avidity of LFA-1, the labeled cells were stimulated with 80 nM of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Wako, Osaka, Japan) for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were added to the Fc-chimeric protein-coated plates to give 1.5 × 105 cells/well in a final volume of 100 μl and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Cells that remained bound after three washes were lysed in 1% SDS, and radioactivity was counted using a liquid scintillation analyzer. In the experiments using blocking antibodies, the PMA-stimulated HL-60 cells were preincubated with 2 μg/ml of antibodies for 30 min at 4°C and then added to the plates. Antibodies used in this study were the anti-CD11a mAbs, MHM-24 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), HI111, G43-25B (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), TP1/32 (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), 38 (Ancell, Bayport, MN); anti-CD11b mAb, 2LPM19c (Dako); anti-CD11c mAb, 3.9 (Sigma); and anti-CD18 mAbs, MHM-23 (Dako), YFC118.3 (Serotec, Oxford, UK). To isolate cDNA for human TLN, we performed PCR using human cerebral neocortex cDNA template and two degenerate oligonucleotide primers (Fig. 1, dashed underlines) based on the conserved amino acid sequences of mouse and rabbit TLN (7Yoshihara Y.

An appropriately sized PCR product (186 base pairs) was subcloned, sequenced, and used as a probe for the following plaque hybridization. The first screening of unamplified λgt11 cDNA library from human cerebral neocortex (9 × 105 recombinants) yielded 50 positive clones. Twelve clones were randomly selected, subjected to the further screenings, and finally isolated. They showed similar restriction mapping patterns, suggesting that they are derived from the same gene. The clone #12 with the longest insert was selected, sequenced for both strands, and analyzed. In the clone #12 (3,035 nucleotides), there are a long open reading frame of 2,772 nucleotides, a 5′-untranslated region of 65 nucleotides, and a 3′-untranslated region of 198 nucleotides, which contains a polyadenylation signal at 13 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) tail (Fig. 1). Within the 3′-untranslated region there are five ATTTA motifs, which are believed to confer instability to mRNA (31Jackson R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 9-14Google Scholar, 32Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Google Scholar). There is one potential translation initiation site (ATG, nucleotides 66-68) surrounded by the nucleotides well matching with the Kozak's consensus sequence (33Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar). An in-frame termination codon TAG locates 54 nucleotides upstream of the initiator ATG. The human TLN polypeptide contains two hydrophobic segments (Fig. 1, boxes), which may serve as a signal peptide (27 residues at the NH2 terminus) and a transmembrane region (28 residues near the COOH terminus). Between the two hydrophobic regions, there is a large extracellular region (805 residues) with 15 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. A cytoplasmic region at the carboxyl terminus is 64 residues in length. Amino acid sequence alignment of human, mouse, and rabbit TLN is shown in Fig. 2. The human TLN is 84 and 85% identical with mouse and rabbit TLN in amino acid sequence, respectively. The presence of nine Ig-like domains and the position of all cysteine residues (28 in the extracellular region and 2 in the cytoplasmic region) are completely conserved in all the three species. Twelve N-linked glycosylation sites are conserved in human, mouse, and rabbit TLN. Northern blot analysis demonstrated human TLN mRNA of 3.0 kilobase pairs in the hippocampus; however, no signal was detected in the cerebellum (Fig. 3). This result is in good agreement with the telencephalon-specific expression of TLN (2Mori K. Fujita S.C. Watanabe Y. Obata K. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3921-3925Google Scholar, 3Oka S. Mori K. Watanabe Y. Neuroscience. 1990; 35: 93-105Google Scholar, 7Yoshihara Y. Oka S. Nemoto Y. Watanabe Y. Nagata S. Kagamiyama H. Mori K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 541-553Google Scholar). The extracellular region of TLN comprises nine tandemly arranged Ig-like domains, rendering TLN to a member of the Ig superfamily (34Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Google Scholar, 35Yoshihara Y. Oka S. Ikeda J. Mori K. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 10: 83-105Google Scholar, 36Brümmendorf T. Rathjen F.G. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 951-1058Google Scholar). In particular, the distal eight Ig-like domains are closely related to those of ICAMs (14Simmons D. Makgova M.W. Seed B. Nature. 1988; 331: 624-627Google Scholar, 15Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Stratowa C. Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 925-933Google Scholar, 16Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Springer T.A.

Total amino acid identity is 50% with ICAM-1 (domains I-V), 55% with ICAM-3 (domains I-V), 38% with ICAM-2 (domains I and II), and 32% with ICAM-4 (domains I and II). The highest homology is observed with the domain II of ICAM-1 and the domains II-IV of ICAM-3 with more than 64% amino acid identity. Together with the presence of characteristic four cysteine residues in the first domain, it will be concluded that TLN is a novel member of the ICAM subgroup of the Ig superfamily. The chromosomal localization of human TLN gene was determined using the FISH technique. The full-length cDNA of the human TLN, which did not cross-hybridize to ICAM-1 and ICAM-3 in genomic Southern blot analysis (data not shown), was used as a probe for the FISH mapping. Among 52 (pro) metaphase chromosome spreads analyzed, 16 showed twin-spot signals on both homologous chromosomes 19p. Since the short arm of chromosome 19p contains mostly R-bands, it is difficult to visualize high-resolution bands by R-banding FISH. Thus, we detected FITC signals on propidium iodide-stained prometaphase chromosomes and then the sublocalization was confirmed by delineation of the high-resolution G-bands. In this system, the precise locus of the human TLN gene was localized on 19p13.2 as shown in Fig. 5. Interestingly, the genes of human ICAM-1 (37Ropers H.H. Pericak-Vance M.A. Genet. Prior. Rep. 1991; 1: 524-547Google Scholar), ICAM-3 (38Bossy D. Mattei M.G. Simmons D.L. Genomics. 1994; 23: 712-713Google Scholar), and ICAM-4 (39Lewis M. Kaita H. Coghlan G. Phillips S. Belcher E. McAlpine P.J. Coopland G.R. Woods R.A. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1988; 52: 137-144Google Scholar) were also mapped to this locus, suggesting that these four molecules were derived from a common ancestral gene by gene duplication. Of all the members of the Ig superfamily, ICAM-1, −2, −3, −4, VCAM-1, and MAdCAM-1 are characteristic in that they interact with integrin counter-receptors (20Bailly P. Tontti E. Hermand P. Cartron J.P. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3316-3320Google Scholar, 23Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Google Scholar). The amino-terminal Ig-like domains of these six molecules have similarly arranged four cysteine residues, suggesting that formation of two intradomain disulfide bonds might be of functional importance for the interaction with integrins. These four cysteine residues are well conserved also in the first Ig-like domain of TLN, raising a possibility of the interaction of TLN with integrin(s). Furthermore, the highly conserved residues proposed to be a critical part of an integrin-binding structure in the first Ig-like domains of ICAMs and VCAM-1 (30Holeness C.L. Bates P.A. Littler A.J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 215-222Google Scholar) are also found in TLN (boxed region in Fig. 6). In particular, human TLN has an identical amino acid sequence in this region with human ICAM-3 and mouse ICAM-2, suggesting that TLN might interact with LFA-1 integrin, a common counter-receptor for ICAMs. To examine this possibility, we performed an adhesion assay with LFA-1-expressing HL-60 cells and purified TLN protein. Soluble recombinant fusion proteins were produced and purified to nearly homogeneity (Fig. 7). TLN(1-5)/Fc comprises the amino-terminal five Ig-like domains of human TLN and the Fc region of human IgG1. ICAM-1/Fc, a positive control, contains all the five Ig-like domains of human ICAM-1 fused to the Fc. Signal peptide/Fc (SP/Fc), a negative control, contains the ICAM-1 signal peptide and the Fc. Cell adhesion assays were carried out with the chimeric proteins immobilized onto the plastic plates via anti-human IgG antibody. When PMA-stimulated HL-60 cells were added into the Fc-chimeric protein-coated wells and incubated at 37°C for 30 min, about 40% of the added cells bound strongly onto the TLN(1-5)/Fc-coated wells (Fig. 8 B). In the same condition, about 60% of the cells bound onto the ICAM-1/Fc-coated wells (Fig. 8 C). In contrast, only 5% bound nonspecifically to SP/Fc (Fig. 8 A) or bovine serum albumin (data not shown), suggesting that the Fc portion is not responsible for the adhesion. The HL-60 adhesion was dependent on the amount of coated proteins (Fig. 9). A similar result of the HL-60 adhesion was obtained when TLN(1-9)/Fc, a fusion protein consisting of the whole extracellular region of TLN and the IgG1 Fc region, was used as a substrate (data not shown). Fc-chimeric proteins of the other two neuronal Ig superfamily molecules, BIG-1 (12Yoshihara Y. Kawasaki M. Tani A. Tamada A. Nagata S. Kagamiyama H. Mori K. Neuron. 1994; 13: 415-426Google Scholar) and BIG-2 (13Yoshihara Y. Kawasaki M. Tamada A. Nagata S. Kagamiyama H. Mori K. J. Neurobiol. 1995; 28: 51-69Google Scholar), did not support the adhesion of HL-60 cells (data not shown), indicating that the binding of HL-60 cells to TLN is specific.Fig. 9HL-60 cell adhesion to different amounts of TLN(1-5)/Fc and ICAM-1/Fc. [3H]Thymidine-labeled and PMA-stimulated HL-60 cells were added to wells precoated with indicated concentrations of recombinant chimeric proteins and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Cells that remained bound after three washes were lysed in 1% SDS and radioactivity was counted. The assay was performed in triplicate and the results are presented as mean percent of input cells bound.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To clarify whether leukocyte integrins are involved in this distinctive adhesion of HL-60 cells to TLN/Fc, a panel of different mAbs were tested for adhesion-blocking activity (Fig. 10). Of the seven mAbs against LFA-1, two mAbs against CD11a (HI-111 and MHM-24) and a mAb against CD18 (MHM-23) selectively inhibited the HL-60 adhesion to ICAM-1/Fc, but not to TLN/Fc, while one mAb against CD11a (G43-25B) showed a reciprocal profile with selective and complete blockade of the HL-60/TLN adhesion. Two anti-CD11a mAbs (TP1/32, 38) and one anti-CD18 mAb (YFC118.3) significantly blocked the adhesion to both ICAM-1/Fc and TLN(1-5)/Fc. The HL-60 adhesion to both ICAM-1/Fc and TLN(1-5)/Fc was not affected by mAbs against CD11b (2LPM19c) and CD11c (3.9) (data not shown). These results suggest that the LFA-1 integrin (CD11a/CD18) is involved in the HL-60 adhesion to TLN(1-5)/Fc and that overlapping but different portions of the LFA-1 molecule interact with TLN and ICAM-1. It has been reported that most of the interaction mediated by integrins are dependent on the presence of divalent cations in the extracellular milieu and that the activation of integrin-expressing cells induce conformational change of the integrins from a low- to high-avidity form (44Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar, 45Loftus J.C. Smith J.W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25235-25238Google Scholar, 46Lub M. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 479-483Google Scholar). These two properties hold true for the binding between ICAM-1 and LFA-1. As shown in Fig. 11, the addition of EDTA completely abolished the HL-60 adhesion to ICAM-1/Fc, and the pretreatment of HL-60 cells with PMA resulted in marked enhancement of binding to ICAM-1/Fc. On the other hand, the HL-60 cells behaved in a different manner with regard to the adhesion to TLN/Fc. First, EDTA hardly influenced the HL-60 adhesion to TLN/Fc, indicating no requirement of divalent cations for the binding between TLN and LFA-1. Second, the pretreatment with PMA did not increase the HL-60 adhesion to TLN/Fc, indicating that the binding between LFA-1 and TLN is activation-independent. These results suggest that LFA-1 on HL-60 cells is constitutively activated for TLN binding, but not for ICAM-1, or that TLN can bind to both resting (low-avidity) and active (high-avidity) forms of LFA-1 on HL-60 cells. We have identified and characterized the human TLN. TLN is a type I integral membrane protein with nine Ig-like domains in its extracellular region, belonging to the Ig superfamily. Here, we provided three characteristic features of TLN that indicate an intimate relationship of TLN with ICAMs. First, among all the Ig superfamily molecules so far identified, the Ig-like domains of TLN are most closely related to those of ICAM-1 and ICAM-3 and also show a weaker but significant homology to those of ICAM-2 and ICAM-4. Second, chromosomal locus of the human TLN gene was mapped to 19p13.2 in the vicinity of other three ICAM genes (ICAM-1, -3, and -4). Third, TLN protein was able to bind LFA-1, a common counter-receptor for ICAMs, although the manner of interaction was distinctive (see below). These findings indicate that TLN is a member of ICAM subgroup of the Ig superfamily and shares many properties with hitherto known ICAM subgroup members. However, the expression of TLN is confined to the telencephalon of the central nervous system (2Mori K. Fujita S.C. Watanabe Y. Obata K. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3921-3925Google Scholar, 3Oka S. Mori K. Watanabe Y. Neuroscience. 1990; 35: 93-105Google Scholar, 7Yoshihara Y. Oka S. Nemoto Y. Watanabe Y. Nagata S. Kagamiyama H. Mori K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 541-553Google Scholar), whereas all the other ICAM members are expressed mostly by cells in the immune and blood systems, such as lymphocytes (ICAM-1 and −3), endothelial cells (ICAM-1 and −2), epithelial cells (ICAM-1), and erythrocytes (ICAM-4) (14Simmons D. Makgova M.W. Seed B. Nature. 1988; 331: 624-627Google Scholar, 15Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Stratowa C. Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 925-933Google Scholar, 16Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L.

Cartron J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5306-5310Google Scholar). Thus, although the molecular structure, chromosomal localization, and LFA-1 binding property of TLN are closely related to those of ICAMs, TLN is the first unique neuronal member of the ICAM subgroup. The human TLN is highly homologous to mouse and rabbit TLN with 85% amino acid identity. This value is significantly higher than those between human and mouse ICAM-1 (53%) (47Horley K.J. Carpenito C. Baker B. Takei F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2889-2896Google Scholar) or ICAM-2 (60%) (48Xu H. Tong I.L. De Fougerolles A.R. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2650-2655Google Scholar), reflecting difference in molecular evolution between the nervous and immune systems. Compared with neurons in the brain which are sequestered within the blood-brain barrier, cells in the immune system suffer from more direct attacks by pathogens such as viruses and parasites that invade into blood and lymph streams. It has been assumed that pathogens frequently target immunologically important structures such as cell surface molecules. In particular, several adhesion molecules in the immune system have been identified as viral or parasitic receptors: ICAM-1 for rhinovirus and malaria-infected erythrocytes (49Greve J.M. Davis G.

Beverley P.C.L. Clapham P.R. Crawford D.H. Greaves M.F. Weiss R.A. Nature. 1984; 312: 763-767Google Scholar), Mac-1 (αMβ2 integrin) for hookworm glycoprotein (53Moyle M. Foster D.L. McGrath D.E. Brown S.M. Laroche Y. De Meutter J.D. Stanssens P. Bogowitz C.A. Fried V.A. Ely J.A. Soule H.R. Vlasuk G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10008-10015Google Scholar), and αV integrins for adenovirus (54Nemerow G.R. Cheresh D.A. Wickham T.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 52-55Google Scholar). Therefore, the cell adhesion molecules in the immune system may undergo more frequent changes in their molecular structures in order to escape from viral attacks, resulting in lower amino acid identities among different species. This is in good agreement with the idea by Murphy (55Murphy P.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 823-826Google Scholar) that the proteins in host defense system have changed their sequences more rapidly in evolution in response to the challenge by pathogens. We observed significant and specific adhesion of HL-60 cells on purified recombinant TLN/Fc, as well as on ICAM-1/Fc. The adhesion on TLN/Fc was inhibited by pretreatment of HL-60 cells with two mAbs against CD11a (G43-25B, 38) and one mAb against CD18 (YFC118.3). This result indicates that LFA-1 is a candidate counter-receptor for TLN. In contrast, three mAbs (HI-111, MHM-24, MHM-23) that completely blocked the LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding had no effect on the binding of HL-60 cells to TLN/Fc. Conversely, a mAb G43-25B strongly inhibited the LFA-1/TLN binding, whereas it showed little effect on the LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding. The overlapping but different profile of these mAbs in adhesion blocking activity indicates that the binding site on LFA-1 for TLN may be close to but distinct from that for ICAM-1. Similar differential effects of a panel of anti-LFA-1 mAbs were reported in T cell binding to ICAM-1 versus ICAM-3 (56Landis R.C. McDowall A. Holness C.L.L. Littler A.J. Simmons D.L. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 529-537Google Scholar). Thus, LFA-1 is capable of binding its multiple counter-receptors in a selective manner. The binding of LFA-1 on the HL-60 cells to TLN/Fc was unusual in that it required neither divalent cations nor PMA stimulation. Most of the interactions mediated by integrins are dependent on divalent cations and are activated by inside-out signaling (44Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar, 45Loftus J.C. Smith J.W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25235-25238Google Scholar) with a few exceptions (57Lallier T. Bronner-Fraser M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1335-1345Google Scholar, 58Van der Vieren M. Trong H.L. Wood C.L. Moore P.F. John T.St. Staunton D.E. Gallatin W.M. Immunity. 1995; 3: 683-690Google Scholar). In the case of LFA-1 integrin, four different counter-receptors act in distinctive manners in respect of requirement for divalent cations, activation by phorbol ester, and activation by anti-CD44 antibody (Table I) (59Vermot-Desroches C. Wijdenes J. Valmu L. Roy C. Pigott R. Nortamo P. Garhmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2460-2464Google Scholar). Our result suggests that LFA-1 on the HL-60 cells may be constitutively activated for the binding to TLN, but not to ICAM-1. A similar activation-independent binding has been reported in the case of interaction between ICAM-3 and a novel leukointegrin, αdβ2 (58Van der Vieren M. Trong H.L. Wood C.L. Moore P.F.

Open table in a new tab In the central nervous system, LFA-1 is constitutively expressed by microglia, but not by neurons, astrocytes, nor oligodendrocytes (60Akiyama H. McGeer P.L. J. Neuroimmunol. 1990; 30: 81-93Google Scholar, 61Smith M.E.F. Thomas J.A. J. Clin. Pathol. 1990; 43: 893-900Google Scholar). The microglia are also called brain-type macrophages, usually ramified in a resting state, but activated in neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and brain trauma. When activated, the microglia change their shape, migrate to the damaged neurons, proliferate, show neurotoxic activity, and remove dead cells by phagocytosis (62Gehrmann J. Matsumoto Y. Kreutzberg G.W. Brain Res. Rev. 1995; 20: 269-287Google Scholar, 63Streit W.J. Kincaid-Colton C.A. Sci. Am. 1995; 273: 54-61Google Scholar). The constitutive expression of TLN in neurons and LFA-1 in microglia and the present finding demonstrating TLN/LFA-1 binding without integrin activation suggest that TLN and LFA-1 may mediate neuron/microglia interaction in the telencephalon of the normal brain. This interaction might be necessary for the central nervous system to hold microglia on a tight leash, suppressing its phagocytic and cytotoxic activity in the healthy brain. Alternatively, TLN might be a neuronal target molecule for LFA-1-expressing activated microglia or infiltrating neutrophils, T lymphocytes, and macrophages in some brain diseases. Thus, the finding of binding between TLN and LFA-1 provides a basis for detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cell-cell interactions between telencephalic neurons and LFA-1-expressing leukocytes and microglia. Such knowledge could help to investigate possible molecular tools that prevent LFA-1-expressing leukocytes and activated microglia from attacking and destroying telencephalic neurons in neurological diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2071908402,"Thrombospondin, a major secretory product of the α-granules of activated platelets, is a large trimeric glycoprotein that plays an important role in platelet aggregation. On resting platelets, thrombospondin binds to a single receptor in a cation-independent manner, but upon platelet activation it binds at least two further, distinct receptors that are both dependent upon divalent cations. Each of these receptors on the platelet surface binds to different regions of the thrombospondin molecule, and such binding may be responsible for the multifunctional role of thrombospondin in aggregation. We show here that a peptide from the carboxyl terminus of thrombospondin, RFYVVMWK, directly and specifically induces the activation and aggregation of washed human platelets from different donors at concentrations of 5-25 μM. At lower concentrations the peptide synergizes with suboptimal concentrations of ADP to induce aggregation. Peptide affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody were used to identify the receptor for the carboxyl-terminal peptide as the integrin-associated protein. The integrin-associated protein remained bound to the RFYVVMWK-containing peptide column when washed with a scrambled peptide in the presence of 5 mM EDTA, indicating a divalent cation-independent association. It is suggested that integrin-associated protein is the primary receptor for thrombospondin on the surface of resting platelets and is implicated in potentiating the platelet aggregation response.

The integrin-associated protein remained bound to the RFYVVMWK-containing peptide column when washed with a scrambled peptide in the presence of 5 mM EDTA, indicating a divalent cation-independent association. It is suggested that integrin-associated protein is the primary receptor for thrombospondin on the surface of resting platelets and is implicated in potentiating the platelet aggregation response."
https://openalex.org/W2005278123,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is a large multisubunit complex that stabilizes the ternary complex, eIF2·GTP·tRNAi Met, and promotes mRNA binding to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. eIF3 also functions as a ribosome subunit anti-association factor. The molecular mechanisms by which eIF3 exerts these functions are poorly understood. We describe here the cloning of the cDNA encoding the human homologue of the yeast eIF3 subunit Prt1. The human PRT1 cDNA encodes a protein of predicted molecular mass of 98.9 kDa that migrates at 116 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Human and yeast Prt1 share 31% identity and 50% similarity at the amino acid level. The homology is distributed throughout the entire protein, except for the amino terminus, and is particularly high in the central portion of the protein, which contains a putative RNA recognition motif. hPrt1 is recognized by an antibody raised against eIF3, and an affinity-purified antibody to recombinant hPrt1 recognizes a protein migrating at 116 kDa in a purified eIF3 preparation. Far Western analysis shows that hPrt1 interacts directly with the p170 subunit of eIF3. Mapping studies identify the RNA recognition motif as the region required for association with p170. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that hPrt1 is a component of eIF3. Our data, combined with those of Hershey and co-workers, suggest that mammalian eIF3 is composed of at least 10 subunits: p170, p116 (hPrt1), p110, p66, p48, p47, p44, p40, p36, and p35.

Eukaryotic protein synthesis requires the participation of translation initiation factors, which assist in the binding of the mRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit (reviewed in 1Merrick W.C.

Ribosome binding is facilitated by the cap structure (m7GpppN, where N is any nucleotide) that is present at the 5′ end of all cellular mRNAs (except organellar). Biochemical fractionation studies elucidated the general pathway for translation initiation and led to the characterization of several translation initiation factors (3Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. J.

Eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is the largest translation initiation factor, with at least 8 different polypeptide subunits and a total mass of approximately 550-700 kDa (6Schreier M.H.

It also interacts with the ternary complex and stabilizes the binding of the latter to the 40 S ribosomal subunit (5Trachsel H. Erni B. Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol.

Biol. 1977; 116: 727-753Google Scholar). A direct interaction between the eIF4G subunit of eIF4F and eIF3 has been demonstrated (20Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Google Scholar), and a role for eIF3 serving as a bridge between the 40 S ribosomal subunit and eIF4F-bound mRNA has been postulated (20Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Google Scholar). The complex structure of eIF3 and its pleiotropic roles in translation initiation have rendered the study of this factor difficult. The protein sequence for only three of the yeast subunits (SUI1/p16, GCD10/p62, and PRT1/p90) has been published (18Garcia-Barrio M.T. Naranda T. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Cuesta R. Hinnebusch A.G.

Hershey, submitted for publication. 3K. Johnson and W. C. Merrick, submitted for publication. The yeast protein p90, also known as Prt1, is the best characterized. Prt1 is an integral subunit of eIF3 (19Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32286-32292Google Scholar, 23Danaie P. Wittmer B. Altmann M. Trachsel H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4525-4535Google Scholar). To further understand the structure and function of mammalian eIF3, we have cloned the putative human homologue of the yeast eIF3 subunit Prt1. The human Prt1 cDNA (hPrt1) is predicted to encode a protein of 873 amino acids, and shares 31% identity and 50% similarity with the yeast Prt1. Immunological characterization show that hPrt1 is part of the eIF3 complex and co-migrates with the 115-kDa polypeptide of eIF3. Far Western analysis demonstrates that hPrt1 is incorporated into the eIF3 complex by virtue of a direct interaction with the largest subunit of eIF3, p170. The p170 interaction site is located in a conserved region of hPrt1, which contains part of the RRM. Materials were obtained from the following sources. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. T7 RNA polymerase, RNasin, and rabbit reticulocyte lysate were from Promega. T7 DNA polymerase sequencing kit was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Protein A-Sepharose was from Repligen. Heart muscle kinase was from Sigma. Hybond-N+ nylon membrane, chemiluminescence system was from Amersham Corp. Nitrocellulose membrane was from Schleicher & Schuell. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Millipore. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. Oligonucleotides were prepared at the Sheldon Biotechnology Center, McGill University. All other reagents were at least reagent grade. The expressed sequence tag used in this study was identified using established expressed sequence tag (EST) methods described previously (29Adams M.D. Fleischmann R.D. Fuldner R.A. Bult C.J. Lee N.H. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Gocayne J.D. White O. et al.Nature. 1995; 377: 3-174Google Scholar), and this partial cDNA clone encoding the human homologue of the yeast Prt1 protein was used to obtain the full-length cDNA clone. Full-length cDNA clones for hPrt1 were isolated from a λgt11 human placenta cDNA library (generous gift from Morag Park, McGill University). A 250-base pair DNA was generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the hPrt1 EST clone as template and the following primers: 5′-TTTACGGTTTTGACAAGTA-3′ and 5′-TTAGGAGACCAACG-3′. The amplified DNA was 32P-labeled by random priming using [α-32P]dCTP, random hexamers, and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (30Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Google Scholar), and used as a probe in cDNA screening and Northern blot analysis. For cDNA screening, 5 × 105 phages displayed on duplicate sets of filters (Hybond-N+, Amersham) were prehybridized in 5 × SSPE (20 × SSPE is 3.6 M NaCl, 0.2 M Na3PO4, 0.02 M EDTA, pH 7.7), 5 × Denhardt's solution (1 × Denhardt's is 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone), 0.5% SDS, and 40 μg/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA, for 4 h at 65°C. Hybridization was performed in the same buffer containing the hPrt1 probe at 1 × 106 cpm/ml for 16 h at 65°C. Filters were washed to a final stringency of 0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 65°C, and exposed to Kodak XAR films for 72 h with intensifying screens. Phages from positive clones were used to prepare plate lysates, and DNA was purified, digested with SalI, and ligated into pBluescript that had been digested with SalI. Oligonucleotides used for sequencing were derived from either pBluescript or from the hPrt1 EST DNA sequence. The nucleotide sequence for full-length hPrt1-1 was obtained from both strands of independent overlapping clones using the dideoxy chain termination method (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) and the T7 polymerase sequencing kit (Pharmacia). Regions of compression were re-sequenced using 7-deaza-dGTP. The full-length cDNA (clone 3-6) was excised from the λgt11 phage by SalI digestion and inserted into pBluescript KS in the T7 promoter orientation. The resulting vector is designated as KST7hPrt1-6. Constructs for truncated hPrt1 proteins were generated by PCR using primers in which an EcoRI site had been engineered. Cleavage of the PCR product with EcoRI and ligation into pARΔ[59/69] (32Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Google Scholar) or pGEX2T[128/129] (32Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Google Scholar) that had been digested with EcoRI preserves the hPrt1 open reading frame and creates a GST-FLAG-HMK or FLAG-HMK fusion protein. For pARΔ NΔ146, the forward primer was 5′-ACCGGAATTCAAAATGGACGCGGACGAGCCCTC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AGCGGAATTCTTAAATCCCCCACTGCAG-3′. For pGEX N255, the hPrt1 open reading frame was first amplified by PCR and inserted into pGEX2T[128/129]. The resulting vector was linearized with HindIII, blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase, and religated. Religation creates a stop codon 3 amino acids downstream of hPrt1 residue 255. pGEX 146-255 was obtained by linearizing pGEX NΔ146 with HindIII, blunt-ending with Klenow, and religating. Vectors were transformed in either E. coli BL21 or BL21 pLysS. Bacteria were grown in LB broth to an optical density of 0.5, and protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were pelleted and lysed in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by 6 sonication cycles. Debris was removed by centrifugation. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) as described previously (33Méthot N. Pause A. Hershey J.W.B. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 2307-2316Google Scholar). FLAG-HMK fusion proteins were affinity-purified over an anti-FLAG column (Kodak) according to the manufacturer's specifications. pACTAG-hPrt1 was made by linearizing pACTAG-2 (34Charest A. Wagner J. Shen S.-H. Trembley M.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 425-432Google Scholar) with NotI, and inserting the hPrt1 open reading frame that had been excised from KST7hPrt1 cut with NotI. hPrt1 is expressed from this vector as a fusion protein bearing three hemagglutinin (HA) tags at its amino terminus. KST7hPrt1-6 was digested with DraI, and the linearized plasmid was used as template for in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) under conditions recommended by the supplier. Translation reactions were performed in nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in a final volume of 15 μl. Reaction mixtures contained 10 μl of lysate, 10 μCi of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol), 15 units of RNasin (Promega), 20 μM amino acid mixture (minus methionine), and 100 ng of RNA. The reactions were incubated 60 min at 30°C and stopped by the addition of three volumes of Laemmli buffer. Translation products were analyzed by 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were fixed, treated in 16% salicylic acid (Sigma), dried, and processed for autoradiography. For HA-hPrt1 protein expression, HeLa cells that had been cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were infected for 1 h with recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3 with the T7 RNA polymerase cDNA inserted into its genome (35Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Google Scholar), and transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in DMEM without FBS. Cells were incubated 2 h with the DNA-Lipofectin mixture, and returned to DMEM-10% FBS for 12 h before harvesting. The cells were lysed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 75 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (25 ng/ml), and pepstatin (1 ng/ml). Cellular debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and protein content was assayed by the Bradford method. Immunoprecipitations were performed on 200 μg of extract using α-HA antibody. Briefly, extracts were diluted to 500 μl in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and incubated on ice for 30 min with 1 μg of antibody. Protein-A-Sepharose (Repligen) was added and allowed to mix at 4°C for 60 min. The beads were washed five times in RIPA buffer before addition Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates were then loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with a goat anti-rabbit eIF3 antibody. Immunoreactive species were visualized using the Renaissance chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham). Affinity-purified antibodies against recombinant hPrt1 were obtained using a protocol described by Asano et al. (43Asano K. Kinzy T.G. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1101-1109Google Scholar). E. coli extracts expressing hPrt1 NΔ146 were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The bands containing NΔ146 were excised, blocked in Blotto (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.075% Tween 20, 0.5% milk powder), incubated with crude α-eIF3, and washed. Antibodies bound to the membrane were eluted with 2 M glycine, 1 mM EGTA, pH 2.5, and neutralized by the addition of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. To eliminate contamination with p110 (hNip1), 50 μg of GST-p110 immobilizes on nitrocellulose were present during the incubation with crude α-eIF3 antibodies. Western blotting was performed with antibodies at the following dilutions: α-eIF3, 1:3000; α-p170, 1:10. For Western blots performed with the monoclonal α-p170 antibody, horseradish-peroxidase α-mouse IgM (Pierce) secondary antibodies were used; for α-eIF3, α-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase; for α-hPrt1, α-goat IgG-alkaline phosphatase. Total RNA from HeLa cells was isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) and fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel overnight at 40 V. RNA was blotted to Hybond N filters overnight and UV cross-linked to the membrane using UV light (Stratalinker). The membrane was prehybridized and hybridized under conditions identical to those used for the cDNA library screening, and exposed for 24 h to a Kodak BioMax film with intensifying screen. Partially purified FLAG-HMK hPrt1 fusion proteins (1-3 μg) were 32P-labeled using heart muscle kinase (Sigma) as described (32Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) or nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight with 5% milk in HBB buffer (25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT), and incubated 4 h in hybridization buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 75 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% milk) containing the 32P-labeled FLAG-HMK- or GST-FLAG-HMK-hPrt1 at 250,000 cpm/ml and unlabeled purified GST at 1 μg/ml. The membranes were washed three times with hybridization buffer and processed for autoradiography. EST 112738 from Human Genome Science Inc. encodes a predicted protein with homology to the yeast p90 eIF3 subunit, Prt1. The cDNA sequence, 2 kilobase pairs in length, contains a polyadenylation signal and a short polyadenylate tail. An ATG codon is present at the 5′ end of the clone. However, this ATG is not preceded by stop codons (Fig. 1 A). It was therefore possible that EST 112738 contains an incomplete cDNA. A 32P-labeled probe derived from the 5′ end of the EST sequence was generated and used in a Northern analysis on HeLa cell RNA. A single RNA species, migrating at 3.1 kilobases, hybridized with the probe (Fig. 1 B). We concluded that 1 kilobase pair was missing from EST 112738. To obtain the full-length cDNA sequence, a human placenta λgt11 cDNA library (generous gift from M. Park) was screened with the same probe used in the Northern analysis. Many (40Scherly D. Boelens W. Dathan N.A. van Venrooij W.J. Mattaj I.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 502-506Google Scholar) positive plaques were obtained, and some of the cDNAs extended further upstream of the 5′-most sequence of EST 112738. One of these cDNAs, 3-6, contained a 3-kilobase pair insert with a predicted open reading frame of 873 amino acids encoding a protein with a molecular mass of 98.9 kDa. An ATG codon is located 53 nucleotides downstream of the 5′ end but is not preceded by an in-frame stop codon (Fig. 1 A). Thus, it is formally possible that clone 3-6 encodes a partial cDNA. However, since the length of the cDNA closely resembles that of the mRNA, and because the translation product from clone 3-6 migrates at the expected molecular weight (see below), the first ATG most probably constitutes the authentic initiation codon. An in-frame CTG codon 24 nucleotides upstream of the first AUG is present and could potentially serve as the initiation codon. We have named the protein encoded by this cDNA hPrt1, for human Prt1. The cDNA sequence of hPrt1 is predicted to encode a protein containing a canonical RRM located between amino acids 185 and 270 (Fig. 2). The identification of the hPrt1 RRM is based on the consensus structural core sequence of RRMs (25Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Google Scholar), which include the presence of RNP-1 and RNP-2 sequence, and hydrophobic amino acids found at defined positions within the RRM. The presence of an RRM was also previously predicted for the yeast Prt1 protein (22Hanic-Joyce P.J. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2845-2851Google Scholar, 28Evans D.R.H.

Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) with the hPrt1 RRM sequence revealed that the RRM is most highly related to the fourth RRM of the poly(A)-binding protein, PABP. No other common protein motifs are evident. hPrt1 is acidic, with a predicted PI of 4.8. The middle portion of the protein is unusually rich in tryptophan residues (close to 5% tryptophan content over 400 amino acids). Amino acid sequence comparison between human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Prt1 reveal extensive sequence identity (31% identity, 50% homology) across the entire protein except for the first 140 amino acids (Fig. 3). The similarity between yeast and human Prt1 is more striking in the middle portion of the protein, which encompasses the RRM. Several but not all of the tryptophan are conserved, suggesting that they are functionally important. A recent GenBank™ entry for the putative Prt1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe is also highly conserved with hPrt1 (∼35% identity at the protein level; data not shown). The hPrt1 protein contains 2 protein kinase A, 6 protein kinase C, and 17 casein kinase II consensus phosphorylation sites.Fig. 3Amino acid alignment of Prt1 sequences from human and S. cerevisiae. Identical residues are boxed. The alignment was performed using the Megalign program from the DNA*Star software, J. Hein method. Numbers refer to the amino acid position in each respective Prt1 species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is conceivable that hPrt1 is a subunit of eIF3. To prove this, an immunological characterization of hPrt1 and eIF3 was performed. First, we translated in vitro an RNA derived from the hPrt1 cDNA. A single polypeptide, migrating at 116 kDa on a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, was obtained (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). The translation product co-migrated with a 115-kDa protein in a HeLa extract that immunoreacted with α-eIF3 antibodies (lane 3). Thus, the size of hPrt1 is similar to one of the eIF3 subunits. Next, we tested the ability of an α-eIF3 polyclonal antibody to recognize hPrt1. To this end, we expressed hPrt1 fused to the HA epitope tag in HeLa cells using a recombinant vaccinia virus expression system (35Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Google Scholar). Extracts from infected cells were blotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with a polyclonal α-eIF3 antibody (Fig. 4 B). eIF3 subunits (p170 and p115) in extracts from cells transfected with the parental vector (pACTAG-2; 34Charest A. Wagner J. Shen S.-H. Trembley M.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 425-432Google Scholar) or pACTAG-hPrt1 were readily identifiable (lanes 1 and 2). A 125-kDa protein that cross-reacts with α-eIF3 was present in extracts from cells transfected with pACTAG-hPrt, but was absent from cells transfected with the vector alone (compare lanes 1 and 2). To confirm the identity of this protein as HA-hPrt1, immunoprecipitations using an α-HA antibody were performed and the products were probed with an α-eIF3 antibody. The immunoprecipitated HA-hPrt1 co-migrated with the 125-kDa polypeptide, and cross-reacted with the α-eIF3 antibody (lane 4). The slower mobility of HA-hPrt1 relative to hPrt1 is probably due to the three HA epitopes present in the fusion protein. Immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with the parental vector (lane 3) or with a vector encoding HA-La autoantigen (lane 5) failed to cross-react with α-eIF3. We conclude that hPrt1 is recognized by an antibody directed against eIF3. Finally, we wished to determine whether antibodies directed against hPrt1 could recognize a 115-kDa polypeptide in purified human eIF3. Attempts to generate antibodies against hPrt1 in rabbits failed. To circumvent this problem, affinity-purified hPrt1-specific antibodies from α-eIF3 antisera were prepared from crude eIF3 antibodies, using a bacterially expressed hPrt1 fragment. These antibodies recognized a protein migrating at approximately 115 kDa in a highly purified human eIF3 preparation and in HeLa extracts (Fig. 4 C), and did not cross-react with hNip1, a 110-kDa protein also recently shown to be an eIF3 component (see “Discussion” and 43Asano K. Kinzy T.G. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1101-1109Google Scholar). Together with the previous data, these experiments strongly suggest that hPrt1 is one of the polypeptides found in the 115-kDa band of eIF3, the other being hNip1 (43Asano K. Kinzy T.G. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1101-1109Google Scholar). To further substantiate the finding that hPrt1 is a subunit of human eIF3, we examined the possibility that hPrt1 interacts directly with one or more eIF3 subunits. To this end, hPrt1 was tagged with a FLAG peptide linked to a heart muscle kinase phosphorylation site peptide (FLAG-HMK) or fused to a glutathioneS-transferase-FLAG-HMK sequence (GST-FLAG-HMK). We opted to use fragments of hPrt1 rather than the full-length protein due to the low yield and extensive degradation of full-length hPrt1 in E. coli. Fig. 5 illustrates the various fragments that were used. The proteins were purified using a FLAG antibody or glutathione-Sepharose resin, and were 32P-labeled with heart muscle kinase. The labeled proteins were then used to detect interacting proteins by the Far Western assay with HeLa cytoplasmic extracts, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and different preparations of eIF3. Two of the probes, GST N255 (amino acids 1-255 of hPrt1) and NΔ146 (amino acids 147-873), interacted with a 170-kDa protein in HeLa and rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Fig. 6, panels A and B, lanes 1 and 2). The hPrt1 probes reacted with a 140-kDa polypeptide in eIF3 preparation 1 (panels A and B, lane 3), and 140- and 170-kDa polypeptides in eIF3 preparation 2 (panels A and B, lane 4). A 32P-labeled probe consisting of a GST-HMK fusion fragment only failed to recognize any proteins (data not shown). The 170-kDa polypeptide in HeLa, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and eIF3 preparation 2 could be the largest subunit of eIF3, p170. This polypeptide is sensitive to degradation, and the two eIF3 preparations used here differ by the extent of p170 proteolysis. An immunoblot using a monoclonal antibody directed against p170 (11Mengod G. Trachsel H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 825: 169-174Google Scholar) reveals the extent of p170 degradation in the eIF3 preparations (Fig. 6 C), and clearly shows that a 140-kDa degradation product of p170 is present in preparation 1 (lane 3), and to a lesser extent, in preparation 2 (lane 4). This experiment demonstrates that hPrt1 interacts directly with the p170 subunit of eIF3. No other eIF3 subunits were recognized by the hPrt1 probes in this assay (data not shown).Fig. 6hPrt1 interacts with p170 through a region that encompasses the RRM. A, B, D, and E, Far Western blots on HeLa cell extracts (70 μg), rabbit reticulocyte lysate (70 μg), and purified eIF3 preparations (1 μg) using various 32P-labeled hPrt1 fragments. The identity of the fragment is indicated at the bottom of each panel. C, immunoblot using a monoclonal antibody directed against the p170 subunit of eIF3 on membranes identical to those shown in panels A and B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The finding that both the NΔ146 and N255 fragments of hPrt1 react with p170 suggest that the site of protein-protein interaction is located between amino acids 147 and 255. This segment of hPrt1, which encompasses most of the RRM, was assessed for its ability to interact with p170 independently of other sequences. A fragment containing amino acids 147-255 of hPrt1, used as a probe in a Far Western assay, indeed interacted with p170 (Fig. 6 D). To further delimit the interaction site, fragment 147-209 was tested, and failed to interact with p170 (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that a portion of the RRM is crucial for the association between hPrt1 and p170. We have cloned a human cDNA that is homologous to the yeast eIF3 subunit, Prt1. In vitro translation of hPrt1 RNA yielded a polypeptide of 116 kDa that co-migrated with one of the eIF3 subunits. Immunological characterization revealed that hPrt1 immunoreacts with α-eIF3 and that affinity-purified α-hPrt1 antibodies recognize a polypeptide of approximately 115 kDa in a highly purified eIF3 preparation. A direct interaction between hPrt1 and the p170 subunit of mammalian eIF3 has been demonstrated. Based on these data, we conclude that hPrt1 corresponds to one of the two 115-kDa subunits of eIF3. The immunoprecipitates of HA-hPrt1 did not contain other eIF3 subunits. It is likely that HA-hPrt1 does not incorporate well into the endogenous eIF3 because of the stability of the complex. Alternatively the HA tag may hinder association of HA-hPrt1 with eIF3. Recently, Hershey and co-workers have isolated a human cDNA predicted to encode a 110-kDa protein that showed homology to the yeast Nip1 protein. Although Nip1 is not present in yeast eIF3 preparations, the human homologue is a subunit eIF3. Using affinity-purified antibodies against hPrt1 and hNip1, Asano et al. (43Asano K. Kinzy T.G. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1101-1109Google Scholar) demonstrated that these polypeptides co-localize with the 40 S ribosomal subunit and other eIF3 subunits. Our data combined with Hershey's group work suggest that mammalian eIF3 contains two subunits that migrate at approximately 115 kDa. Indeed, examination of various rat or rabbit eIF3 preparations resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis clearly shows two polypeptides migrating at this position (8Behlke J. Bommer U.-A. Lutsch G. Henske A. Bielka H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 523-530Google Scholar, 9Meyer L.J. Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4206-4212Google Scholar). In human eIF3, these two polypeptides were shown to correspond to immunologically distinct proteins, the largest (116 kDa) being hPrt1 and the smallest (110 kDa) corresponding to hNip1 (43Asano K. Kinzy T.G. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1101-1109Google Scholar). Thus, the mammalian eIF3 complex consists of at least nine polypeptides: p170, p116 (hPrt1), p110 (hNip1), p66, p47, p44, p40, p36, and p35. In addition, a new subunit, p48, has also been identified. 4K. Asano and J. W. B. Hershey, personal communication. Mutations in the PRT1 gene of S. cerevisiae impair translation initiation in vivo at 37°C (37Hartwell L.H. McLaughlin C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 1664-1671Google Scholar, 38Hartwell L.H. McLaughlin C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 468-474Google Scholar). One of the mutants, prt1-1, failed to promote binding of the ternary complex eIF2·GTP·tRNAi Met to the 40 S ribosomal subunit (24Feinberg B. McLaughlin C.S. Moldave K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10846-10851Google Scholar). Evans et al. (28Evans D.R.H. Rasmussen C. Hanic-Joyce P.J. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Barnes C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4525-4535Google Scholar) identified six mutations in PRT1 that impair translation initiation. Two of these mutations alter amino acids that are conserved between yeast and human Prt1. Human Prt1, when expressed in the prt1-1 yeast strain, was unable to rescue the temperature sensitive phenotype. 5N. Méthot, unpublished data. This was somewhat surprising since yeast eIF3 functions in a mammalian methionyl-puromycin assay system (19Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32286-32292Google Scholar). Methionyl-puromycin synthesis is dependent on the binding of the ternary complex to the 40 S ribosome, requires only washed ribosomes, tRNAi Met, eIF1A, eIF2, eIF3, eIF5, and eIF5A (39Benne R. Brown-Luedi M.L. Hershey J.W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 15-35Google Scholar), but does not measure mRNA binding to the ribosome. It is clear that yeast eIF3 can replace mammalian eIF3 for some, but not all normal eIF3 functions, and that hPrt1 is unable to fulfill all the roles of yeast Prt1. One reason for the inability of hPrt1 to replace Prt1 in vivo is that it may not incorporate into the yeast eIF3 complex. A Far Western analysis on yeast extracts using the hPrt1 N255 fragment did not reveal any interacting proteins. 6N. Méthot, E. Rom, H. Olsen, and N. Sonenberg, unpublished observations. Both yeast and human Prt1 contain an amino-terminal RRM (residues 185-270 in hPrt1). The RRM contains the sequence elements that are responsible for specific protein-protein interactions with the p170 subunit of eIF3 (Fig. 6). It is unlikely that the interaction between hPrt1 and p170 is mediated through RNA, since hPrt1 was unable to bind a radiolabeled RNA probe as measured by UV photocross-linking and Northwestern assays.5 Furthermore, treatment of the FLAG-HMK NΔ146 probe and the nitrocellulose membrane with RNase A did not reduce the intensity of the interaction with p170.5 It is possible that the RRM is functional as an RNA binding module only within the eIF3 complex, and that its RNA binding activity and specificity are modulated by p170. Precedents for protein-protein interactions altering the RNA binding activity of an RRM-containing protein exist. The spliceosomal protein U2B” is unable on its own to distinguish between the U1 and U2 small nuclear RNAs, but will bind specifically to U2 small nuclear RNA in the presence of the U2A′ protein (40Scherly D. Boelens W. Dathan N.A. van Venrooij W.J. Mattaj I.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 502-506Google Scholar, 41Scherly D. Dathan N.A. Boelens W. van Venrooij W.J. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3675-3681Google Scholar). U2A′ and U2B” associate in the absence of RNA, an interaction that is mediated by the RRM (41Scherly D. Dathan N.A. Boelens W. van Venrooij W.J. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3675-3681Google Scholar). The major RNA-binding protein of yeast eIF3 is the p62 subunit (19Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32286-32292Google Scholar). It would be interesting to compare the RNA binding specificities of p62 and the whole eIF3. We have shown previously that the p170 subunit of eIF3 interacts directly with eIF4B (42Méthot N. Song M.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5328-5334Google Scholar). The sites of interaction of eIF4B and hPrt1 on p170 do not appear to be the same, since hPrt1 reacts very strongly with the 140-kDa degradation product of p170, while eIF4B does not. The multiple protein-protein interactions involving p170 suggest that this subunit may play a central role in eIF3 function. We thank Hans Trachsel and William C. Merrick for the generous gifts of eIF3 preparations, and H. Trachsel for the p170 monoclonal antibody. We are grateful to K. Asano and J. W. B. Hershey for communicating their results prior to publication and for the experiment shown in Fig. 4 C. We are indebted to Morag Park for the placenta λgt11 cDNA library."

The logistical difficulties faced by steroid receptors or other transcription factors of sorting through this much genetic information is further increased by the density of nuclear DNA (approximately 10-50 mg/ml). Standard models propose that steroid receptors find target elements by repeated cycles of dissociation and reassociation until a high affinity site is found (cycling model) and/or by conducting a one-dimensional search along the DNA (sliding model). A third model proposes that steroid receptors search for target sites in the genome by DNA intersegment transfer. In this model, receptor dimers bind nonspecific DNA sequences and search for a target site by binding a second strand of DNA before dissociating from the first, in effect moving through the genome like Tarzan swinging from vine to vine. This model has the advantage that a high concentration of DNA favors, rather than hinders, the search. The intersegment transfer model predicts, in contrast to the cycling and sliding models, that the dissociation rate of receptor from DNA is highly dependent on DNA concentration. We have employed the purified DNA binding domain fragment from the rat glucocorticoid receptor to perform equilibrium and kinetic studies of the DNA dependence of receptor-DNA dissociation. We find receptor dissociation from DNA to be highly dependent on the concentration of DNA in solution, in agreement with the intersegment transfer model. We also find that this interaction is primarily electrostatic, because DNA-like polyanion chains (e.g. heparin and polyglutamate) can mediate the transfer.

These studies provide evidence that direct DNA transfer aids the target site search conducted by steroid receptors in their role as inducible transcription factors. Many eukaryotic transcription factors function by binding to specific DNA sequences upstream of transcription start sites. In order to bind these DNA elements, the protein must first locate these sites in the genome. In humans this search entails locating a few functional binding sites from over 6 billion base pairs of DNA, requiring the protein to sample a vast number of possible binding sites in a very short period of time. Nevertheless, transcription factors are able to find their specific binding sites very rapidly. What are the mechanisms used to locate specific binding sites in chromatin? One model envisions sampling of potential target sites by repeated cycles of dissociation/reassociation of proteins with DNA. This mechanism is commonly assumed to be the search strategy used by site-specific DNA-binding proteins. The theoretical underpinnings of this model were developed in the 1970s (see 1Berg O.G. von Hippel P.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biochem. 1985; 14: 131-160Google Scholar for review), describing the situation where the protein binds nonspecifically to the DNA, dissociates at some intrinsic rate, and then diffuses through the aqueous medium to sample a second site. This cycle is repeated until a high affinity target site is found. This model predicts that the rate of search will be controlled solely by the intrinsic rate of protein dissociation from nonspecific DNA sites and the speed of diffusion through the nuclear volume. The need for alternative models was made apparent by the early observations of Riggs et al. (2Riggs A.D. Bourgeois S. Cohn M. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 401-417Google Scholar), indicating that the association rate for Escherichia coli lac repressor binding to its regulatory element was several orders of magnitude faster than that allowed by a simple diffusion-controlled mechanism (3Winter R.B. Berg O.G. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6961-6977Google Scholar, 4von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 675-678Google Scholar). Further experiments with lac repressor-operator (5Winter R.B. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6948-6960Google Scholar, 6Barkley M.D. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3833-3842Google Scholar) and E. coli CAP protein (7Fried M. Electrophoresis. 1989; 10: 366-376Google Scholar) confirmed and extended this observation. To account for this discrepancy, a second model for protein-DNA search was devised. This strategy describes an intersegment transfer mechanism requiring two binding sites on the protein (or a protein dimer with one site on each monomer). One of the binding sites releases while the other remains bound, allowing the free binding site to interact with a second strand of DNA. This model, termed intersegment transfer (4von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 675-678Google Scholar, 8Berg O.G. Winter R.B. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6929-6948Google Scholar), predicts that increasing concentrations of DNA will increase the apparent dissociation rate of the protein; this is in contrast to the dissociation/reassociation model, in which the rate of protein dissociation is intrinsic and not affected by exogenous DNA. The third mechanism involves the protein sliding along the DNA chain until it encounters a specific binding site. This model reduces the search space to a one-dimensional random walk and has the advantage that it is highly efficient for locating a binding site over a limited distance along the DNA molecule. This model has been successfully applied to restriction endonucleases (9Heitman J. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 445-454Google Scholar, 10Berkhout B. van Wamel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1837-1840Google Scholar) and the lac operator (11Ruusala T. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4903-4907Google Scholar). This mechanism and the first two are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, it is likely that most proteins conduct a short range one-dimensional search in combination with one of the other search mechanisms. Theoretical work indicates that this mechanism alone is not an efficient strategy for a long distance search (12Berg O.G. Blomberg C. Biophys. Chem. 1977; 7: 33-39Google Scholar). Our studies do not directly address the sliding model; instead, they seek to distinguish whether the intersegment transfer or the cycling search mechanism may be employed by the steroid receptor family of transcription factors. We have chosen to study the well characterized rat glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain protein fragment (GRdbd). 1The abbreviations used are: GRdbdglucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domainGRglucocorticoid receptorOEtO-ethylTEK buffer10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 100 mM KClTE1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTAbpbase pairs.

This paper addresses not only the question of whether GRdbd, as a model of the steroid receptor family of transcription factors, may employ an intersegment transfer mechanism as part of its target site search strategy but the mechanistic details of this transfer as well. These questions touch directly upon the ability of regulatory proteins to mediate their effects by rapidly locating specific binding sites in the genome.

Free counts were removed with a Sephadex G-25 spin column, followed by ethanol precipitation in 2.5 M ammonium acetate. The radioactive pellet was washed once with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended to 5 ng/μl. For a standard 20-μl binding experiment, purified GRdbd (0.89 ng) and labeled DNA (2.0 ng) were incubated at a 1:1 molar ratio (4.5 nM each) unless otherwise noted, for 30 min at room temperature in GRdbd binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mM KCl, and 1 mM DTT). Dissociation experiments were conducted by dilution of GRdbd/DNA 100-fold in binding buffer containing 10-fold molar excess of the full binding site oligonucleotide to prevent reassociation of the GRdbd. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a precooled 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (75:1 acryl:bis) and run at 400 V for 2.5 h in 0.5 × TBE buffer (40 mM Tris base, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 40 mM borate) at 0-4°C. There was a delay time of ∼15 s between dilution of complexes and the time the complexes entered the gel for the nominal zero time point. Gels were fixed for 10 min in 7% acetic acid followed by 10 min in 100% methanol (to prevent cracking). Dried gels were exposed to a phosphorimager screen for 2-18 h, and bound and free DNA were quantified on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, model 300E (Sunnyvale, CA). A 50 ml overnight bacterial culture (DH5) in nutrient broth (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was centrifuged at 3300 rpm (2000 × g) for 10 min to form a pellet. Cells were resuspended in 13.3 ml of TE. To this was added 10% SDS to a final concentration of 0.5%, proteinase K to 200 μg/ml, and RNase to 8 μg/ml. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h, and then NaCl was added to 0.7 M and polyethylene glycol 8000 to 0.5% final concentration; the solution was then shaken at 65°C for 10 min. The mixture was then left at room temperature for 30 min. The resulting DNA was extracted once with an equal volume of chloroform and three times with phenol/chloroform (1:1) and precipitated with 2 volumes of EtOH at −20°C overnight. The DNA pellet was centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g, washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in TE. The A260 was determined, and the DNA was diluted to 5 mg/ml. The DNA was sheared by 20 passages through a 25 gauge needle; it ranged in size from 500 to 20,000 bp as determined by gel electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. The GRdbd has been shown to exist as a monomer in solution, but it can bind to DNA cooperatively as a dimer (13Alroy I. Freedman L.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1045-1052Google Scholar, 23Härd T.

Chem. 1991; 266: 3107-3112Google Scholar). This is presented schematically in Fig. 1. An intersegment transfer mechanism can be distinguished from cycling via repeated dissociation and reassociation with DNA by assessing whether the dissociation of the bound GRdbd from DNA is influenced by the concentration of DNA in solution. An intersegment transfer mechanism predicts that increasing DNA will increase the rate of dissociation, whereas increasing DNA will have no effect if a cycling mechanism is used. Experimentally, we measure the loss of the receptor-labeled DNA complex (R2D) with time at different concentrations of unlabeled DNA. First, GRdbd is bound to labeled DNA to equilibrium, and then disequilibrium conditions are imposed so that reestablishment of R2D* is negligible once dissociation has occurred. Generally, this is accomplished by blocking reassociation with a large molar excess of unlabeled DNA. However, this strategy is invalid if DNA itself influences the apparent dissociation constant. We therefore have determined the association and dissociation constants for monomer (k1, k−1) and dimer (k2, k−2) and established conditions wherein we can measure the apparent dissociation constant in the presence of different concentrations of DNA. In Fig. 2 are presented equilibrium binding experiments at GRdbd concentrations ranging from 5 to 250 nM (1-50 ng) and oligonucleotides containing either a full glucocorticoid response element site (right) or a half-site (left). The gel mobility shift assay was used to separate bound complex from free DNA, and each was quantified by phosphorimager analysis. A half-site oligonucleotide was used to measure the equilibrium binding constant K1 for GRdbd monomer binding to DNA. We were able to measure nearly pure monomer complex at concentrations of GRdbd up to 50 nM (10 ng/20 μl). Using the experimentally determined values of free DNA and GRdbd/DNA complex, the equilibrium binding constant K1 = [RD]/[D][R] = 1.8 × 107M−1 was derived. The dimer equilibrium constant K2 was then determined by measuring the overall equilibrium constant from experiments in which GRdbd was bound to a full, palindromic binding site and solving Koverall = K1K2 = [R2D]/[D][R]2 for K2. A value of 3 × 108M−1 was determined for the equilibrium dimer binding constant K2. The observation that K2 is greater than K1 is indicative that dimer binding is cooperative. Data presented in Fig. 2 were used to determine a Hill coefficient (Fig. 3). A coefficient of 1.5 was determined for the binding of GRdbd to the full-site oligonucleotide. A Hill coefficient for dimer binding of between 1 and 2 is indicative of positive cooperativity (29Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 48: 270-299Google Scholar). To study dissociation of a binding protein from DNA, reassociation must be prevented. This is often accomplished by adding excess, unlabeled competitor DNA to inhibit reassociation with labeled DNA. However, this will give incorrect estimates of dissociation rates if the added DNA itself influences the apparent rate of dissociation, as would be predicted for an intersegment transfer mechanism. Gel shift experiments are often done in conditions of protein excess to maximize signal. However, this also means that high excesses of unlabeled DNA must be used to soak up the excess binding protein, thereby exacerbating the possibility that the apparent dissociation rates are being influenced by the added DNA. An alternative strategy to prevent reassociation is to greatly reduce the concentration of the bound complex by dilution, shifting the equilibrium to favor dissociation. Experimentally, this is limited by the ability to detect binding in extremely dilute solutions. We have established that we can readily assess GRdbd binding following a 100-fold dilution of our standard binding condition. To test the extent to which reassociation occurs at this dilution, we mixed DNA and GRdbd at concentrations equivalent to the 100-fold diluted standard condition and showed that some binding was still detectable (about 15% of that seen with undiluted extract). Therefore, some reassociation can occur even after dilution. To prevent this small amount of reassociation, we examined adding a small amount of specific oligonucleotide to the dilution buffer. In a binding reaction in which GRdbd is bound to labeled DNA at a 1:1 molar ratio, addition of an equimolar amount of unlabeled specific oligonucleotide reduces binding by precisely one-half and a 10-fold excess reduces binding by 90%, a concentration at which nonspecific oligonucleotide does not compete (Fig. 4A). In Fig. 4B we show that addition of a 10-fold molar excess of specific oligonucleotide to the dilution buffer completely prevents any reassociation. As subsequent experiments will confirm, addition of this concentration of specific oligonucleotide is still 200-fold below levels at which effects on dissociation rates are observed. Therefore, in all subsequent experiments, dissociation is initiated by 100-fold dilution into a 10-fold excess of specific oligonucleotide. Other nucleic acids or test compounds were added as indicated. Using the dilution condition established above, we examined the dissociation of monomer and dimer GRdbd. As can be seen in Fig. 5, dissociation of monomer from DNA, unlike that of dimer, is quite rapid. Dissociation constants were calculated according to the integrated first-order kinetic equation −kdt = ln(Rt/Ro), where kd is the dissociation constant, t is time, Rt is the complex remaining at time t, and R0 is the initial bound GRdbd (taken as bound counts at time 0). In all of the succeeding figures, dissociation data is presented as ln(Rt) versus time, and the absolute value of the slope of the best fit line represents the apparent kd. As shown in Fig. 5, the dissociation rate of monomer GRdbd from the half-site (k−1) is 1.2 × 10−2 s−1 (∼88 s), and dimer GRdbd from the full site (k−2) is 2.2 × 10−4 s−1 (∼77 min). Thus, the half-life of the monomer complex (ln(2)/k) is about 60 s, and for the dimer complex the half-life approaches 60 min. The association rate for monomer (k1) was too rapid to be measured by gel shift analysis, and because the association rate for dimer (k2) is dependent on the formation of monomer (the GRdbd is a monomer in solution), a direct measurement of association was not possible. However, using the relation between the equilibrium constant and the kinetic constants (K1 = k1/k−1, and similarly, K2 = k2/k−2) we calculate the values for k1 and k2 as 2.1 × 105 and 5.6 × 104M−1s−1 for monomer and dimer, respectively. The equilibrium constant for dimer binding is ∼17 times greater than that for monomer binding, indicative of strongly cooperative binding. This is despite the fact that association of monomer is 3-4-fold faster than that of dimer. Thus, the cooperative effect can be attributed to stabilization of the DNA-bound complex upon dimer formation that results in an almost 60-fold reduction in off-rate compared to monomer. Having established the kinetics of this system, we then measured the effect of additional DNA on the dissociation rate of dimer. Because the intersegment transfer mechanism predicts that increasing concentrations of DNA should increase the apparent dissociation rate of dimer (in contrast to the cycling model), we tested the ability of sheared E. coli DNA and specific or nonspecific oligonucleotides to increase the apparent dissociation rate of GRdbd bound to a specific oligonucleotide. As seen in Fig. 6, increasing amounts of sheared E. coli DNA in the dissociation dilution mix increased the measured off-rate from 2.7 × 10−4 to 3.6 × 10−3 s−1 (from t1/2 = 42.8 min to t1/2 = 3.2 min) over the concentration range of 0-3.0 × 10−4 Mbp (0-200 μg/ml). This is a 13-fold increase in the apparent dissociation rate of GRdbd dimer. The same effect can be demonstrated for specific and nonspecific oligonucleotides (data not shown). Increasing concentrations of oligonucleotide DNA from 1.0 × 10−7 to 1.0 × 10−5M increases the off-rate up to 5.8 × 10−3 s−1 (t1/2 = 2.0 min) for specific oligonucleotide, and 6.0 × 10−3 s−1 (t1/2 = 1.9 min) for nonspecific oligonucleotide. Note that the size of the oligonucleotide used here is 34 base pairs, so the final concentration of added oligonucleotide DNA falls between 3.4 × 10−6 and 3.4 × 10−4 Mbp (between 2.2 and 220 μg/ml), an effective range similar to that obtained with sheared E. coli DNA. These data suggest that the bound GRdbd dimer can transfer between two separate DNA molecules. In addition, the similarity between specific and nonspecific oligonucleotide results suggests that intersegment transfer occurs via non-site-specific binding of DNA. This observation has implications for the binding mechanism employed, an issue addressed further below and under “Discussion.” Although our initial expectation was that intersegment transfer would occur by a strand invasion mechanism whereby one monomer of a bound dimer would transiently bind two separate molecules of DNA, the failure of specific oligonucleotide to increase the apparent off-rate any differently than nonspecific oligonucleotide or bulk DNA led us to question whether a domain other than the site-specific DNA binding domain was mediating intersegment transfer and therefore whether a monomer was itself capable of intersegment transfer. To test this hypothesis, the half-site oligonucleotide was used at concentrations determined to permit exclusively monomer formation (see Fig. 2). We observe indications that monomer complex can undergo intersegment transfer even at added DNA concentrations at the low end of those at which dimer dissociation was affected. As shown in Fig. 7, nonspecific DNA increased the monomer dissociation rate to the limit of our systems measurement (t1/2 ≈ 20 s). At DNA concentrations greater than 1 × 10−6 Mbp (22 μg/ml), dissociation was faster than could be measured. Similar results were obtained with specific oligonucleotide. These data suggest that monomers as well as dimers of GRdbd can transfer from one DNA strand to another. To test the specificity of the transfer mechanism, we employed several compounds that would mimic the long chain polyanionic character of DNA and several control compounds as well (Fig. 8). Three compounds with polyanionic character, heparin, polyglutamate, and ribo-poly(A)·poly(U) could promote dissociation of GRdbd from DNA. However, dissociation was not affected by a neutral macromolecule, polyproline, nor the polyanion subunits, glutamate and heparin disaccharide. Two cations, arginine and spermidine, likewise had no effect on dissociation. These data indicate that the interaction of GRdbd that permits intersegment transfer is primarily electrostatic, requiring a long chain polyanion to promote the dissociation of GRdbd from DNA. A counterion condensation layer is present around DNA and other long chain polyions of sufficient charge density. Displacement of this charge condensation layer provides an entropic gain for protein binding to DNA. Because the intersegment transfer reaction appears to be via nonspecific interactions with negatively charged polyanions, our results suggest that the counter-ion condensation layer around the DNA may play a role in direct intersegment transfer (see “Discussion”). We wished to test whether there was a density of negative charge necessary to promote the intersegment transfer mechanism. Using poly-Glu and a 1:1 random copolymer of Glu/Glu-OEt, we examined the ability of each compound to mediate intersegment transfer. The results shown in Fig. 9 indicate that the transfer reaction is severely inhibited by the reduction of the average charge of the glutamate backbone by 1/2. Poly-Glu increased the off-rate over 80-fold at the highest concentration tested, whereas the Glu-Glu-OEt copolymer increased it only 3-fold. These data indicate the importance of the density of negatively charged residues along the chain, and implicate the need for the formation of a counter-ion condensation layer. The residual effect of the poly-Glu/Glu-OEt may be attributable to the fact that because it is a random copolymer, there will be an occasional region of high charge density due to the clustering of Glu residues in the polymer. Nevertheless, it is clear that charge density is important for the transfer of GRdbd bound to DNA. The present study confirms earlier work indicating that GRdbd exhibits positive cooperativity in binding to DNA as a dimer. Härd et al. (23Härd T. Dahlman K. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Rigler R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5358-5364Google Scholar) estimated by fluorescent spectroscopy that the cooperative effect was about 10-fold for a somewhat larger GRdbd fragment (115 versus 85 amino acids) binding at high salt conditions (270 mM). More recently, this group updated its findings at lower salt conditions (187 mM), estimating a 25-50-fold cooperativity (17Lundbäck T. Cairns C. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlstedt-Duke J. Härd T.

Light-exposed VCOP stimulated [35S]guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate nucleotide exchange on bovine rod transducin in a time-dependent manner with a half-time for activation of 0.75 min, similar to that of bovine rhodopsin.

Although VCOP was able to activate as many as 12 transducins per photoisomerization, rhodopsin catalyzed significantly more. When assays were performed with λ > 420 nm illumination, VCOP exhibited rapid regeneration and high affinity for the photoregenerated 11-cis-retinal.

The orientation of the monomer in the helix in this model agrees with the results of a genetic study of the F-actin binding site of phalloidin (11Drubin D.G. Jones H.D. Wertman K.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1277-1294Google Scholar), chemical cross-linking experiments (12Hegri G. Michel H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Chatterjie N. Healy-Louie G. Elzinga M. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 132-144Google Scholar), and antibody decoration experiments (13Moncman C.L. Peng I. Winkelmann D.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 25: 73-86Google Scholar, 14Orlova A. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 276-285Google Scholar). However, there is little evidence concerning the validity of the model pertaining to the intermonomer contacts that stabilize the helix. A central feature of this model is a postulated interaction of a hydrophobic plug at the tip of a loop between subdomains 3 and 4 with a hydrophobic pocket formed by the interface of two subunits on the opposing strand of the helix. Although the proposed interaction would constitute a major interstrand stabilizing force for the actin helix (Fig. 1A), there is no direct evidence in support of this plug-pocket interaction. In all three published structures of G-actin, the loop is parked against the surface of the actin monomer so that it would be incapable of interacting with the pocket on the opposing strand. Furthermore, there is no direct evidence that this loop rotates through the required 900 in any of the published structural studies of the filament. Finally, normal mode analysis of F-actin (7Tirion M.M. Ben-Avraham D. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 5-12Google Scholar) does not predict the participation of this subdomain 3/4 loop in a rigid plug-pocket interaction as originally predicted by Holmes. This model has been challenged by Schutt and colleagues (15Schutt E.C. Rozycki M.D. Myslik J.C. Lindberg U. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 186-198Google Scholar) on the basis of the relatively low resolution of the electron microscopy measurements used to generate the Holmes model as well as problems with spacing of residues within the filament and the energetics needed for the conformation changes required by the model. They have proposed an alternative model for the actin filament based on the actin-actin contacts found in the actin-profilin ribbon structure that forms during crystallization of the profilin-β actin complex (2Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C.W. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Google Scholar, 16Schutt E.C. Lindberg U. Myslik J.C. Strauss N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 735-746Google Scholar). However, coordinates for this model have not been published, and it has therefore been difficult to analyze the results of experiments pertaining to actin filament structure in terms of the predictions of this model. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae actin (Fig. 1B), which is 87% homologous with skeletal muscle actin, the plug residues F-I-G-M are replaced by Val266-Leu267-Gly268-Leu269, 1The L267D mutation was originally noted as L266D (17Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Google Scholar) to reflect the fact that we called the initiator Met residue of actin Met-1. However, since the initiator Met is retained in yeast actin, we have renumbered this residue. although the residues comprising the strands of the loop are almost identical between the two actins. As an initial test of the plug-pocket interaction model, we previously replaced Leu267 with aspartic acid (17Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Google Scholar), reasoning that if the plug-pocket interaction was important to filament integrity, such a substitution should destabilize the filament. Although this substitution produced only minimal effects in vivo, it resulted in a marked cold-sensitive polymerization defect in vitro. The rate of polymerization of pure mutant actin was retarded at room temperature, but the Cc 2The abbreviations used are: Cccritical concentrationDAPI4ʹ,6ʹ-diamidino-2-phenylindoleFM 4-64N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(p-diethylaminophenylhexatrienyl) pyridinium dibromideBeFxberyllium fluorideWTwild type. was only minimally affected. However, 19 μM mutant actin could not polymerize at 40C. This defect could be rescued by the inclusion of phalloidin as a filament stabilizing agent. critical concentration 4ʹ,6ʹ-diamidino-2-phenylindole N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(p-diethylaminophenylhexatrienyl) pyridinium dibromide beryllium fluoride wild type. These in vitro results were consistent with the Holmes model on two accounts. First, hydrophobic interactions are cold-sensitive (18Privalov P.L. Gill S.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1988; 39: 191-234Google Scholar), and the introduction of an acidic residue into this plug may have lowered its hydrophobicity to such a degree that at 40C, the residual hydrophobicity of the plug was not sufficient for helix stabilization. Second, rescue of polymerization by phalloidin showed that integrity of the monomer was not compromised by the mutation and that the major effect of the mutation was on the interstrand stabilization of the helix. On the other hand, besides the fact that normal mode analysis of F-actin does not predict the occurrence of a rigid plug-pocket structure, nothing is known about the relative contribution of the individual hydrophobic residues of the plug to actin stability or to what extent hydrophobicity of the plug can be lowered before significant disruption of actin function is observed. In essence, the central tenets of the plug-pocket model have yet to be verified. The Holmes plug-pocket model leads to a number of predictions. First, the strongest hydrophobic contacts should involve the N terminus of the plug and the strength of the interaction should decrease toward the plug's C terminus (Fig. 1B). For example, with the muscle actin structure, the phenyl group of Phe266 is the part of the plug most deeply buried in the hydrophobic pocket. Second, at any position in the plug, substitution of a charged residue should produce a more drastic effect than simply eliminating the hydrophobic side chain of the residue normally at that position. Third, plug mutations that affect actin stability should be cold-sensitive. Finally, this model, coupled with our initial results, suggests there may be a “threshold effect” governing this interaction. Removal of one hydrophobic residue might not alter the hydrophobicity of the plug sufficiently to destabilize the helix. However, removal of multiple hydrophobic side chains or insertion of a charged residue should, at some point, disrupt the interaction of the plug with the pocket enough to lead to filament destabilization. In this paper, using a yeast expression system, we have mutagenized each of the three hydrophobic plug residues to test the positional effects predicted by the Holmes model and to determine how hydrophobic the plug has to be for actin polymerization to occur. We replaced Val266 with Asp and Leu269 with Asp and Lys to compare the effects of a charged residue at both ends of the plug relative to those caused by a charge at residue 267. Second, we examined the effects of increasing the hydrophobicity of the first position to that of muscle actin (V266F) and of decreasing the hydrophobicity at positions 266 and 267 by making single substitutions of Gly for either Val266 or Leu267. Finally, we converted both of these residues simultaneously to Gly creating a plug consisting of G-G-G-L in which most of the hydrophobicity of the plug was removed. We then assessed the extent of the defects caused by the mutations in vivo and in vitro and determined the efficacy of different approaches in vitro for overcoming the polymerization defects caused by the most severe of these mutations.

Phalloidin, DAPI, and fluorescent brightener 28 (Calcofluor) were purchased from Sigma. Rhodamine-phalloidin and FM 4-64 (N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(p-diethylaminophenylhexatrienyl) pyridinium dibromide) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).

Affi-Gel 10 active ester agarose was obtained from Bio-Rad. DE52 DEAE-cellulose was obtained from Whatman. Sephacryl S-200 resin was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The BCA assay reagent was purchased from Pierce. The oligodeoxynucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis were synthesized in the DNA Core Facility at the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). As a template for the mutagenesis reactions, we used single strand DNA generated from the plasmid pGEM 3Z(-) into which the yeast actin gene and its promoter had been introduced between the BamHI and EcoRI sites (19Cook R.K. Root D. Miller C. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2410-2415Google Scholar). The following oligodeoxynucleotides were used to generate the mutants we analyzed (in each case the mutant codon is underlined): 5ʹ-CCATCCTTCTGGTTTGGGTTTGG-3ʹ, V266G (VG); 5ʹ-CCTTCTGTTTTGGGTAAGGAATCTGCCGGTATTG-3ʹ, L269K;5ʹ-CCTTCTGTTTTGGGTGATGAATCTGCCGGTATTG-3ʹ, L269D; 5ʹ-CCATCCTTCTG(G/T)TGGTGGTTTGGAATCTGCC-3ʹ, L267G (LG) or the double mutant (GG) V266G,L267G; 5ʹ-CCATCCTTCTTTTTTGGGTTTGG-3ʹ V266F (VF); and 5ʹ-CCATCCTTCTGATTTGGGTTTGG-3ʹ V266D. The mutations were verified by sequencing, and all but one of the BamHI-EcoRI fragments were subcloned into the centromeric yeast shuttle vector pRS314, which is marked by the TRP1 gene (20Sikorski R. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). The coding sequence for V266D actin was cloned into a derivative of the centromeric yeast expression vector YCp50 marked with the URA 3 gene pCENV266D. (21Cook R.K. Sheff D.R. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16825-16833Google Scholar). We transformed the diploid yeast strain TDyDD (21Cook R.K. Sheff D.R. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16825-16833Google Scholar), a gift of D. Shortle (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), with plasmids carrying the mutant actin sequences. This trp 1, ura 3-52 strain has one active chromosomal actin gene and one disrupted with the LEU2 gene. Following transformation and sporulation, haploid colonies with the phenotype TRP/LEU were successfully identified for each mutant at a frequency comparable to that obtained when a WT actin sequence was used in the transforming plasmid. Cells carrying the V266D plasmid were selected in a different fashion. We began with a haploid derivative of TDyDD that carried a chromosomal actin gene interrupted with the LEU2 gene. Actin synthesis in this cell is driven by a wild-type actin gene contained in pRS314 as above. The cells were transformed with pCENV266D, and cells were ultimately selected for their ability to grow on uracil-deficient but not tryptophan-deficient medium. The plasmids were rescued from each of these strains according to Robzyk et al. (22Robzyk K. Kassir Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3790Google Scholar), and the entire coding region sequenced to insure that the mutant sequences were intact. Two wild-type actin strains were prepared: one TDyDDWN-pCEN contained the wild-type actin coding sequence in the YCp50-derived plasmid, and TDyDDWN-PRS contained the wild-type coding sequence on the pRS-314-derived plasmid. The strains with mutant actins were named according to the mutant actins they carried: TDyV266G, TDyV266F, TDyV266D, TDyL267G, TDyL269D, TDyL269K, and TDyGG, the double mutant. Cells were grown either in liquid YPD (2% Bacto-peptone, 1% yeast extract, and 2% glucose), on solid YPD medium (liquid YPD medium containing 2% agar), or in liquid or solid defined medium (23Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-20Google Scholar). Yeast haploid cells were grown to an OD600 of about 0.5-0.8 and processed as follows. Chitin deposition was visualized by staining with Calcofluor (24Pringle J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 732-734Google Scholar). Yeast actin cytoskeletons were visualized by staining with rhodamine phalloidin (25Adams A.E.M. Pringle J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 729-731Google Scholar). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (26Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-601Google Scholar). Vacuoles were visualized according to Vida and Emr (27Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Google Scholar). Here, log phase cells were labeled with the styryl dye FM 4-64 at 300C for 1 h and then chased for 3 h with added fresh YPD media at 300C. Cells were then collected for observation. Fluorescence micrographs were obtained on a Carl Zeiss microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) using Kodak T-MAX 400 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). To assess the percentage of cells with defective phenotypes, we always scored more than 100 cells by microscopy. To assess the ability of the cells to grow in hyperosmolar medium or in glycerol containing medium, the cells were grown on YPD plates for one day. The cells were then replica-plated to YPD plates, hyperosmolar plates (YPD containing 0.9 M NaCl), or YPG plates (2% glycerol instead of glucose). Plates were photographed at different times during the incubations. For the TDyV266D cells, an isogenic wild-type strain TDyDDWN-pCEN was used as a control. For the other mutant cells, the control was the isogenic wild-type strain TDyDDWN-PRS. The two wild-type strains had identical growth rates at 300C, but strain TDyDDWN-PRS grew about 40% faster at 100C than did TDyDDWN-pCEN. The generation times for each strain in liquid YPD at different temperatures were determined as follows. Following growth overnight in YPD, cells were diluted into 10 ml of fresh YPD preincubated at the desired temperature, and the cultures were incubated at the desired temperature in a rolling drum apparatus. Aliquots were removed at desired intervals and the cell density at 600 nm was measured. Triplicates of each strain were followed, and the growth of wild type and mutant cells was assessed at the same time. The ranges for the determination were less than 5% of the mean. Mutant actins were purified from the appropriate cells using the DNase I-agarose procedure of Cook et al. (21Cook R.K. Sheff D.R. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16825-16833Google Scholar) in the Ca2+-G form and stored at 40C in Ca2+-G-buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol). Wild-type actin was purified from cakes of S. carlsbergensis obtained at a local bakery. The sequence of this actin is identical to that from S. cerevisiae (28Nellen W. Donath C. Moos M. Gallwitz D. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1981; 1: 239-244Google Scholar). Actins were used within 4 days following completion of purification. Since the GG-actin was likely to be cold-sensitive, its polymerization during purification was carried out at room temperature. Following centrifugation, a clear gelatinous pellet was observed as was the case for the other mutant actins, although the GG-actin solution was decidedly less viscous than the other actins prior to centrifugation. We obtained about 2-3 mg of actin from 10 liters of cell culture in which the cells were grown to stationary phase. However, because of the difficulty in inducing GG-actin monomers to self-associate, it was important to concentrate the unpolymerized actin to a smaller volume than used with the other mutant actins prior to induction of association by the addition of salt to avoid losing a large percentage of the protein in the supernatant fraction following centrifugation. Where noted, the actin was further purified by passage over Sephacryl S-200 equilibrated in Ca2+-G-buffer to eliminate residual actin oligomers. Protein concentrations were determined by the Pierce BCA assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. All actins were purified to a single band as determined by electrophoresis in SDS on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Ca2+-G actins were converted to the Mg2+ forms according to Strzelecka-Golaszewska et al. (29Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Google Scholar). Actin polymerization assay and critical concentration determination were done according to Chen et al. (17Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Google Scholar). In experiments that examined the ability of BeFx to stabilize mutant F-actin, 5 mM NaF and 0.1 mM BeCl2 were added to the samples of G-actin just prior to induction of polymerization (30Muhlrad A. Cheung P. Phan B.C. Miller C. Reisler E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11852-11858Google Scholar). For visualization of actin filaments, samples were polymerized at the desired temperature for 1 h, and samples were then deposited on carbon-coated Formvar grids. The grid was washed and stained with 1.5% uranyl acetate. The samples were then examined with a model 7000 electron microscope (Hitachi Instruments Inc., San Jose, CA) in the University of Iowa Central Electron Microscope Facility. Because hydrophobic interactions tend to weaken as the temperature decreases, Holmes' model suggests that any growth defect due to diminished hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic plug should be more pronounced as the growth temperature is lowered. We thus determined the growth rates of wild-type cells and cells expressing each of the mutant actins. TDyV266D cells grow normally at 300C but exhibit about a 25% decreased rate of growth at 100C in comparison to wild-type cells, similar to what we previously observed when the negative charge was placed at Leu267. Cells containing the other actins with single mutations display little or no difference in generation time at temperatures between 100C and 370C when grown in liquid YPD. At 300C, the optimal growth temperature for yeast, GG cells grew at roughly 40% of the rate of wild-type cells (Table I). Decreasing the growth temperature caused an increase in the generation time of the GG cells relative to the wild-type cells such that after 50 h at 100C, growth of the GG cells arrested. This cold sensitivity was much more severe than that noted with the V266D cells or previously with the L267D (17Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Google Scholar). Increasing the temperature to 370C also produced a significant decrease in the growth rate of GG compared with wild-type cells, suggesting they were somewhat temperature-sensitive. Use of a plating assay to measure growth of GG cells at 15 and 300C produced the same results.Table IDoubling times for WT and GG haploid cells at different temperaturesCellsTemperature (0C)1015233037hWT22.88.43.32.12.6GGGrowth arrest30.56.13.56.6 Open table in a new tab Exposure of yeast to hyperosmolar conditions causes a restructuring of the actin cytoskeleton (31Chowdhury S. Smith K.W. Gustin M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 561-571Google Scholar), and some actin mutations have been shown to result in osmosensitive cells (31Chowdhury S. Smith K.W. Gustin M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 561-571Google Scholar, 32Novick P. Botstein D. Cell. 1985; 40: 405-416Google Scholar). Of the mutant cells studied here, only the GG cells showed retarded growth on hyperosmolar plates (Fig. 2). After 2-3 days' incubation at 300C, growth of the GG cells was virtually nonexistent, although the cells seemed to recover over the next 2-3 days. These results may reflect the inability of the GG-actin to properly nucleate filament formation or form stable filament assemblies in response to the environmental stress. All of the mutant strains appeared to grow normally on plates containing 2% glycerol as a sole carbon source, although we did not determine the generation times of the cells in liquid medium containing glycerol. In yeast, actin is an important determinant of cell polarity and cell size and shape (11Drubin D.G. Jones H.D. Wertman K.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1277-1294Google Scholar, 32Novick P. Botstein D. Cell. 1985; 40: 405-416Google Scholar). Microscopic examination of V266G, V266D, V266F, L267G, L269K, and L269D cells showed that their size and morphology is normal. However, the diameter of GG cells is generally larger than that of wild-type cells, and 10% of the GG cells are about 3 times larger in diameter than that of wild-type cells (Figs. 3E, 4C, and 5C). Staining with Calcofluor showed that V266F, V266D, L267G, L269K, and L269D cells displayed well-formed chitin rings at the sites of previous budding events and the axial budding polarity typical of yeast. Although chitin was also localized in V266G cells, these cells displayed a random budding phenotype approximately 30% of the time (Fig. 3D), indicating that the V266G mutation caused a mild abnormal phenotype in vivo not observed with the L267G or the more drastic V266D mutation. For the GG cells, the chitin was delocalized in 86% of the 100 cells observed (Fig. 3F), suggesting the presence of a significant secretion defect resulting from elimination of the hydrophobic side chains of Val266 and Leu267.Fig. 4Nuclear segregation defect in GG mutant cells.

Scale bar, 5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In yeast, actin plays a role in mitotic spindle orientation and migration (33Palmer R.E. Sullivan D.S. Huffaker T. Koshland D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 583-593Google Scholar), and yeast morphogenetic mutants usually are defective in nuclear segregation (11Drubin D.G. Jones H.D. Wertman K.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1277-1294Google Scholar, 34Adams A.E.M. Johnson D.I. Longnecker R.M. Sloat B.F. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 934-945Google Scholar). The large size of GG cells and the cell polarity defect suggests that the GG mutation may have significantly compromised proper nuclear segregation. We thus examined cells stained with DNA directed dye DAPI. About 12% of the GG cells contain either two or more nuclei (Fig. 4). Actin has been implicated in vacuolar morphology determination and vacuolar segregation (35Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5892-5907Google Scholar) 3K. Hill and L. Weisman, personal communication. in S. cerevisiae. We investigated vacuolar morphology and localization in TDyGG cells using a vacuole membrane specific dye FM 4-64 (27Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Google Scholar). In around 40% of the GG cells, the vacuole appears either as a large single lobe or as one with a few large lobes instead of a collection of small multilobed bodies typical of wild-type cells (Fig. 5). Five percent of these cells also show a defect in vacuolar segregation. These results suggest that the GG mutation produces an abnormal topology and/or distribution of actin filaments leading to the altered vacuole and nuclear segregation behavior we observe. To visualize the actin cytoskeleton directly, we stained wild-type and mutant cells with rhodamine-phalloidin. The cytoskeletons of V266G, L267G, L269K, and L269D cells appeared normal with actin cables in the mother cells along the growth axis of the cell and actin patches primarily in the buds in the early stages of the cell cycle. However, GG cells contain a markedly altered cytoskeleton with cables generally absent in the mother cell and bright patches in both the mother cell and bud (Fig. 6). At 300C, randomly oriented thick actin bars or ribbons are present in approximately 10% of the cells. Growth at 100C for 16 h produces these abnormal assemblies in roughly 30% of the cells observed (Fig. 6C). This abnormal cytoskeletal structure is consistent with the aberrant growth and morphology associated with these cells and again suggests that the GG mutation causes a cold-sensitive defect in actin function. The disorganization of actin structures in the GG cells implies either a defect in actin polymerization or the inability of GG-actin to interact properly with various actin binding proteins in vivo. To begin to assess the molecular basis of the defect associated with the GG mutation, we assessed the polymerization characteristics of the different purified mutant actins. Our ability to obtain these mutant actins by our normal purification protocol indicates that the different mutations have no major deleterious effect on the integrity of the actin monomer.

This calcium-independent protease activity was not found in another furin-deficient cell strain, 7.P15, selected from the monkey kidney cell line COS-7."
https://openalex.org/W2012545068,"The Csk family of tyrosine protein kinases comprises two members named Csk and Chk. These enzymes phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of Src-related kinases in vitro, thereby repressing their activity. Csk has been found to be necessary for normal embryonic development, and to be a potent negative regulator of antigen receptor signaling in T-lymphocytes. As the functions of Chk in mammalian cells are not known, we examined its ability to carry out Csk-like functions in vivo. Like p50csk, Chk reduced the elevated phosphotyrosine levels and the augmented activity of Src family kinases in Csk-deficient fibroblasts. Contrary to Csk, however, Chk was inefficient at repressing antigen receptor-induced signals in a T-cell line (BI-141). We also noted that Chk, but not Csk, failed to stably associate with cellular membranes following addition of a membrane targeting signal to its amino terminus. This observation suggested that Chk may contain dominant targeting sequences disallowing its recruitment to cellular membranes. Hence, these data demonstrate that Chk can mediate some, but not all, Csk-related functions in vivo. Moreover, they suggest that the “restricted” function of Chk may relate at least in part to its inability to be recruited to certain cellular locales.

Csk is a 50-kilodalton (kDa)-cytosolic tyrosine protein kinase expressed in all cell types (1; reviewed in 2Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Google Scholar and 3Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 207-226Google Scholar). As is the case for members of the Src family, Csk contains amino-terminal Src homology (SH) 1The abbreviations used are: SHSrc homologyTCRT-cell receptorMEFsmouse embryo fibroblastsFCSfetal calf serumGAPGTPase-activating proteinMAbmonoclonal antibodyMOPSN-morpholinopropanesulfonic acidIL-2interleukin-2RIPAradioimmunoprecipitation assay. 3 and SH2 domains, as well as a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain. In contrast to Src-related enzymes, however, p50csk does not possess an amino-terminal site of myristoylation, a site of autophosphorylation, or a carboxyl-terminal site of tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1). Significant interest in p50csk stems from its ability to phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of Src family kinases in vitro, thereby repressing their enzymatic activity.

The importance of Csk in normal cellular physiology was first highlighted by the observation that Csk-deficient mice, generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells, exhibited severe abnormalities in the central nervous system and early embryonic lethality (4Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Google Scholar, 5Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Google Scholar). Furthermore, Csk-deficient embryonic stem cells were unable to differentiate into T- or B-cells, when injected into blastocysts (6Gross J.A. Appleby M.W. Chien S. Nada S. Bartelmez S.H. Okada M. Aizawa S. Perlmutter R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 463-473Google Scholar). Support for the notion that Csk functions in vivo by repressing Src family kinases was lent by the observation that fibroblasts derived from Csk-deficient embryos possessed hyperactive Src family kinases (p60c-src, p59fyn, and p56lyn) and elevated levels of phosphotyrosine (4Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Google Scholar, 5Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Google Scholar). p50csk also plays several critical roles in mature cellular physiology (7Chow L.M.L. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A.

Notably, we reported that overexpression of Csk in an antigen-specific T-cell line (BI-141) caused a pronounced inhibition of T-cell receptor (TCR)-induced tyrosine protein phosphorylation and lymphokine secretion (7Chow L.M.L. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Google Scholar, 8Cloutier J.-F. Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Google Scholar).

We and others (11Chow L.M.L. Jarvis C. Hu Q. Nye S.H. Gervais F.G. Veillette A. Matis L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4975-4979Google Scholar, 12Klages S. Adam D. Class K. Fargnoli J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1833-1842Google Scholar) have shown that Chk can phosphorylate the inhibitory carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of several Src-related enzymes in vitro, including Lck, Fyn, and c-Src. Unlike Csk, Chk only accumulates in brain and hemopoietic cells. Moreover, as a consequence of alternative splicing, the chk gene codes for two distinct proteins, p52chk and p56chk, which differ by the absence or presence of a 40-amino acid extension at their amino terminus (19; Fig. 1). Although the purpose of these two different Chk polypeptides is not determined, p52chk primarily abounds in brain, whereas p56chk is predominantly contained in hemopoietic cells. However, it should be pointed out that, while p56chk is prominently expressed in human hemopoietic cells (15McVicar D.W. Lal B.K. Lloyd A. Kawamura M. Chen Y.-Q. Zhang X. Staples J.E. Ortaldo J.R. O'Shea J.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2037-2044Google Scholar), it is generally a minor component of Chk proteins in mouse hemopoietic cells (19Chow L.M.L. Davidson D. Fournel M. Gosselin P. Lemieux S. Lyu M.S. Kozak C.A. Matis L.A. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3437-3448Google Scholar). The significance of this species difference is not understood. Little is known of the role(s) of Chk in normal cellular physiology. Because it is seemingly always expressed with Csk, it is reasonable to speculate that the two enzymes may not serve fully identical functions. To begin dissecting these roles, we have tested the capacity of Chk to execute p50csk-type functions in vivo. Our studies showed that, like Csk, Chk was apt at reducing the abundance of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and the increased activity of p60c-src and p59fyn in Csk-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Unlike Csk, however, Chk was inefficient at repressing antigen receptor-induced signal transduction in T-cells. While these results supported the notion that Chk is also a negative regulator of Src family kinases in vivo, they implied that Chk may have a restricted Csk-like biological activity in mammalian cells. Csk-deficient and wild-type MEFs immortalized with simian virus (SV) 40 large T antigen were established by Imamoto and Soriano (5Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Google Scholar) and provided by Drs. Brian Howell and Jon Cooper (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing a chimera bearing the SH3 and SH2 regions of Csk and the kinase domain of Chk (Csk-Chk chimera) will be described elsewhere. 2D. Davidson, L. M. L. Chow, and A. Veillette, unpublished results. BI-141 is an antigen-specific mouse T-cell hybridoma specific for the antigen beef insulin presented in the context of AαbAβk class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (20Reske-Kunz A.B. Rüde E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1985; 15: 1048-1054Google Scholar). BI-141 derivatives expressing the neomycin phosphotransferase alone (Neo) or in combination with wild-type Csk or membrane-targeted Src-Csk were reported elsewhere (7Chow L.M.L. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Google Scholar). A BI-141 cell line expressing a myristoylation-defective version of Src-Csk, in which glycine 2 was mutated to alanine (A2Src-Csk), was generated by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer.2 MEFs and NIH 3T3 cells were propagated in α minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), whereas BI-141 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS. Whenever indicated, puromycin or G418 was added to the growth medium. cDNAs encoding mouse p52chk or p56chk or rat p50csk were described elsewhere (1Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 11Chow L.M.L. Jarvis C. Hu Q. Nye S.H. Gervais F.G. Veillette A. Matis L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A src-chk cDNA was engineered by fusing in-frame the sequences coding for the 15 amino-terminal residues of Src to the full coding sequence of p52chk, through polymerase chain reaction. The first 15 residues of Src contain a myristoylation signal as well as polybasic sequences required for stable membrane association (21Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Google Scholar). The resulting chimeric cDNA was resequenced to ensure that no unwanted mutation had been introduced in the process (data not shown). For expression in MEFs from Csk-deficient mice (which contain an endogenous neomycin resistance gene (neo)), cDNAs were cloned in the multiple cloning site of the retroviral vector pBabePuro (22Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Google Scholar), which confers resistance to puromycin. In the case of BI-141 T-cells, cDNAs were inserted in the retroviral vector pLXSN (23Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990Google Scholar), which bears the neo gene. Retroviral constructs were transfected in ψ-2 packaging cells by calcium phosphate precipitation (24Cartier M. Chang M.W.M. Stanners C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1623-1628Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected by growth in medium containing either puromycin (1.0 μg/ml) or G418 (0.4 mg/ml). Retroviral supernatants were obtained from these cells and used to infect either MEFs or BI-141 T-cells, as described elsewhere (25Albritton L.M. Tseng L. Scadden D. Cunningham J.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 659-666Google Scholar). In both cases, monoclonal antibiotic-resistant derivatives were established by limiting dilution and screened by immunoblotting of total cell lysates with the appropriate antibodies.

Affinity-purified rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were reported elsewhere (28Davidson D. Chow L.M.L. Fournel M. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1483-1492Google Scholar), whereas anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (MAb) 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies reacting against GTPase-activating protein (GAP) of p21ras and Shc were obtained from Drs. Louise Larose and John Bergeron (Montréal, Québec, Canada), respectively. MAbs against the SH3 region of p60src (MAb 327) were reported elsewhere (29Lipsich L.A. Lewis A.J. Brugge J.S. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 352-360Google Scholar), whereas MAbs against cortactin (MAb 4F11), Fak (MAb 2A7), and AFAP-110 (MAb F1) were generous gifts from Dr. Tom Parsons (Charlottesville, VA) (30Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Google Scholar). MAb LA-074 was generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 2-17 of the Src sequence and acquired from Quality Biotech, Camden, NJ. Anti-paxillin MAbs were purchased from Signal Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY. Anti-TCR MAb F23.1 was described elsewhere (31Staerz U.D. Rammensee H. Benedetto J.D. Bevan M.J.J. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 3994-4000Google Scholar). After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) supplemented with 10 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, N-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as well as the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (50 mM) and sodium orthovanadate (1 mM). Polypeptides were recovered by immunoprecipitation using the indicated antibodies. Immune complexes were collected with Staphylococcus aureus protein A (Pansorbin; Calbiochem) coupled, if indicated, to rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) G. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA buffer containing 1 mM sodium orthovanadate. Proteins were then eluted in sample buffer, boiled, electrophoresed in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, and transferred onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for immunoblotting. Immunoblots were performed according to a previously described protocol (32Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Google Scholar). After incubation with 125I-protein A (Amersham Canada, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) or 125I-goat anti-mouse IgG (ICN Pharmaceuticals Canada Ltd., Montréal, Québec, Canada), immunoreactive products were detected by autoradiography and quantitated with a PhosphorImager. These assays were done under linear conditions according to a previously described protocol (33Davidson D. Fournel M. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10956-10963Google Scholar). They were conducted in the presence of acid-denatured rabbit muscle enolase as a model substrate. Data were quantitated with a PhosphorImager. For cell fractionation, cells were incubated for 15 min in hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA pH 8.0) supplemented with the protease and phosphatase inhibitors outlined above. Then membranes were mechanically broken using a Dounce homogenizer. In all cases, staining with trypan blue confirmed that over 95% of cells had been lysed (data not shown). After adjusting the homogenates to 0.15 M NaCl, intact cells, nuclei, and large membrane sheets were removed by two successive centrifugations at 480 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were then separated into soluble (S100) and particulate (P100) fractions by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The various fractions were extracted in boiling sample buffer. Particulate fractions were washed once with hypotonic buffer prior to detergent extraction. Lysates corresponding to defined cell numbers were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Src antibodies (see above). To avoid overloading the protein gels, lysates from 4 × lower cell numbers were used for the S100 fraction. This factor was taken into consideration in the subsequent calculation of the relative distribution of the chimeric proteins. The validity of the cell fractionation procedure was confirmed as reported previously (8Cloutier J.-F. Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Google Scholar, 19Chow L.M.L. Davidson D. Fournel M. Gosselin P. Lemieux S. Lyu M.S. Kozak C.A. Matis L.A. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3437-3448Google Scholar). For myristic acid labeling, cells were incubated for 4 h at 370C with 1.0 mCi/ml [3H]myristic acid (DuPont NEN), in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% dialyzed FCS. For labeling with [35S]methionine, cells were incubated for the same period of time with 1.0 mCi/ml Translabel (ICN Pharmaceuticals Canada Ltd., Montréal, Québec, Canada) in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% dialyzed FCS. After this incubation, cells were processed for immunoprecipitation as described above. T-cells were activated by stimulation for 2 min at 370C with anti-TCR Vβ8 mouse MAb F23.1 and sheep anti-mouse IgG, as outlined elsewhere (7Chow L.M.L. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Google Scholar, 28Davidson D. Chow L.M.L. Fournel M. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1483-1492Google Scholar). Following activation, cells were lysed in boiling sample buffer, and lysates were processed for anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. To measure lymphokine secretion, cells were incubated for 24 h with various concentrations of MAb F23.1 coated on plastic, according to a protocol detailed elsewhere (34Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). Release of interleukin-2 (IL-2) was determined by testing the ability of serial dilutions of the supernatants to support growth of the IL-2-dependent T-cell line HT-2. Units of IL-2 were calculated using a titration curve generated with recombinant IL-2 as reference. Antigen stimulation assays were conducted by incubating BI-141 derivatives with irradiated spleen cells expressing AαbAβk class II MHC molecules (obtained from a cross between B10 and B10.BR mice; The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) and pulsed with various concentrations of beef insulin. After 24 h of stimulation, supernatants were collected and assayed for lymphokine release by measuring their ability to support [3H]thymidine incorporation into HT-2 cells. Controls were without addition. To test whether Chk can mediate Csk-type functions in mammalian cells, we examined whether it could restore the regulation of tyrosine protein phosphorylation in Csk-deficient MEFs (4Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Google Scholar, 5Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Google Scholar, 35Nada S. Okada M. Aizawa S. Nakagawa H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3571-3578Google Scholar). Cells were infected with retroviruses encoding the puromycin resistance gene (puro) alone or in combination with p52chk, p56chk, or p50csk (Fig. 1). Monoclonal puromycin-resistant cell lines were screened by immunoblotting with anti-Csk or anti-Chk antibodies (data not shown). For cells expressing the puro gene alone, pools of antibiotic-resistant clones were used in our analyses. Immunoblotting of total cell lysates with an anti-Csk serum (Fig. 2A, top panel) showed that csk-/- MEFs containing the puro gene alone (lane 2) lacked p50csk. However, easily detectable amounts of p50csk were present in derivatives in which a csk cDNA was re-introduced (lanes 3 and 4), as well as in MEFs derived from wild-type (csk+/+) mice (lane 1). Parallel lysates were also probed by immunoblotting with anti-Chk antibodies (bottom panel). This experiment demonstrated that, contrary to control MEFs (lanes 1 and 2) which are devoid of endogenous Chk, cells infected with retroviruses encoding p52chk (lanes 5 and 6) or p56chk (lanes 7 and 8) contained appreciable quantities of the relevant Chk protein. In agreement with our earlier report (19Chow L.M.L. Davidson D. Fournel M. Gosselin P. Lemieux S. Lyu M.S. Kozak C.A. Matis L.A. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3437-3448Google Scholar), the expression levels of p52chk were consistently greater than those of p56chk in these cells. The basis for this difference is not known. To ensure that equivalent amounts of Chk and Csk were expressed in these cell lines, we took advantage of NIH 3T3 cells expressing a chimeric protein bearing the SH3 and SH2 domains of Csk and the catalytic region of Chk (Csk-Chk chimera). This polypeptide reacted both with antibodies directed against the SH3 domain of p50csk (Fig. 2B, top panel, lanes 6-8) and with antibodies against the kinase domain of Chk (bottom panel, lanes 7-9). Hence, using Csk-Chk as an internal standard, we could show that the range of expression of either p52chk or p56chk was roughly equivalent to that of p50csk (compare top panel, lanes 3 and 4 with bottom panel, lanes 2-5). The abundance of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in these cells was examined by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of total cell lysates (Fig. 3). Consistent with earlier reports (4Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Google Scholar, 5Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Google Scholar, 35Nada S. Okada M. Aizawa S. Nakagawa H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3571-3578Google Scholar, 36Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Google Scholar), MEFs lacking p50csk (lane 2) contained markedly elevated levels of phosphotyrosine, in comparison with either MEFs derived from wild-type mice (lane 1) or csk-/- MEFs expressing p50csk (lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, Csk-deficient MEFs containing either p52chk (lanes 5 and 6) or p56chk (lanes 7 and 8) exhibited a striking reduction in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, in comparison with MEFs devoid of p50csk (lane 2). Such a diminution affected all appreciable substrates. However, it is noteworthy that this decrease was slightly less than that observed in cells expressing p50csk (compare lanes 5-8 with lanes 1, 3, and 4). It has been demonstrated that components linked to the cytoskeleton, such as cortactin and paxillin, contain elevated amounts of phosphotyrosine in Csk-deficient MEFs (35Nada S. Okada M. Aizawa S. Nakagawa H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3571-3578Google Scholar, 36Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Google Scholar). To directly ascertain whether expression of Chk regulated these products, they were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 4, A and B, top panel). The abundance of these proteins was also monitored by immunoblotting of parallel immunoprecipitates with anti-cortactin or anti-paxillin antibodies, respectively (bottom panel). These analyses revealed that p52chk and p56chk markedly reduced the phosphotyrosine content of the 80-kDa cortactin (Fig. 4A) and 68-74-kDa paxillin (Fig. 4B). Similar observations were made for p125fak and AFAP-110, two other components of the cytoskeleton (data not shown). The differential ability of Csk and Chk to regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of predominantly cytosolic substrates was also assessed. GAP and its associated proteins (p62 and p190) as well as the adaptor molecule Shc were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies and probed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 4, C and D, top panel). Contrary to MEFs expressing p50csk (lanes 1, 3, and 4), cells lacking Csk (lane 2) exhibited pronounced tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP-associated p62 and p190 (Fig. 4C), as well as of the 52- and 46-kDa isoforms of Shc (Fig. 4D). Little tyrosine phosphorylation of the 120-kDa GAP polypeptide was observed in these cells. Introduction of either Chk isoform in Csk-deficient MEFs dramatically reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP-associated p62 and p190 (Fig. 4C, lanes 5-8). Similarly, the phosphotyrosine content of Shc (Fig. 4D, lanes 5-8) was diminished. Although the tyrosine phosphorylation of these substrates was clearly regulated by Chk, several polypeptides remained slightly hyperphosphorylated, especially in cells expressing p56chk. This may relate to the lower levels of p56chk expression generally achieved in these cells (Fig. 2). To further prove that Chk has Csk-like activity in fibroblasts, its influence on the enzymatic activity of Src and Fyn was determined. The cell lines described above were lysed in RIPA buffer, and the enzymatic activity of Src or Fyn was determined in immune complex kinase reactions, using acid-denatured rabbit muscle enolase as a model substrate (Fig. 5, A and C). The relative specific activity of these enzymes was then calculated as described in the legend of Fig. 5. All experiments were conducted under linear assay conditions (data not shown). In agreement with other reports (4Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Google Scholar, 5Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Google Scholar, 35Nada S. Okada M. Aizawa S. Nakagawa H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3571-3578Google Scholar), the ability of p60c-src (Fig. 5, A and B) and p59fyn (Fig. 5, C and D) to phosphorylate enolase was increased ∼5-fold in MEFs lacking Csk (lane 2), in contrast to MEFs containing p50csk (lanes 1, 3, and 4). Expression of either p52chk (lanes 5 and 6) or p56chk (lanes 7 and 8) in Csk-deficient MEFs reduced the specific activity of p60c-src by 2.5-3-fold, whereas that of p59fyn was diminished by 3-5-fold (Fig. 5, B and D). Once again, this diminution was slightly less than that effected by Csk expression (lanes 3 and 4). We also noted that the abundance of Fyn was increased in cells expressing Csk or Chk (Fig. 5C, lanes 3-8), in comparison with csk-/- MEFs (lane 2). Perhaps, the abundance of p59fyn was lowered in cells lacking Csk, in order to compensate for the augmented specific activity of the enzyme. We also tested the impact of Chk on the physiology of BI-141 T-cells. Cells were infected with retroviruses encoding either p52chk or p56chk, in combination with the neomycin resistance gene (neo). Furthermore, a chimera encompassing the full sequence of p52chk and the 15 amino-terminal residues of Src (Src-Chk chimera; Fig. 1) was engineered and also introduced in BI-141 cells. After selection in G418-containing medium, Chk-expressing monoclonal cell lines were detected by immunoblotting with an antiserum against Chk (data not shown). Levels of Chk expression in representative cell lines are depicted in Fig. 6A. Like other transformed T-cell lines (11Chow L.M.L. Jarvis C. Hu Q. Nye S.H. Gervais F.G. Veillette A. Matis L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4975-4979Google Scholar), control neomycin-resistant BI-141 cells (Neo) did not contain appreciable amounts of Chk (lanes 1 and 2). Nevertheless, all other cell lines expressed the appropriate Chk polypeptide (lanes 3-14). Furthermore, quantitative analyses similar to those described above (Fig. 2B) confirmed that p52chk and p56chk accumulated to levels similar to those achieved by overexpressed p50csk in earlier studies (7, 8; data not shown). Finally, the expression levels of Src-Chk were compared with those of a Src-Csk chimera, expressed in the same manner in BI-141 cells (7Chow L.M.L. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of total cell lysates with an antibody against the Src-derived membrane targeting signal (MAb LA-074) revealed that Src-Chk (Fig. 6B, lanes 3-6) and Src-Csk (lanes 7 and 8) were expressed in comparable quantities in BI-141 cells. To ascertain the effect of Chk on antigen receptor-mediated signals, cells were stimulated with anti-TCR MAb F23.1 and sheep anti-mouse IgG f"

To test this concept, we determined the effect of inhibition of endogenous ganglioside synthesis upon neurite formation induced by retinoic acid in LAN-5 human neuroblastoma cells. Ganglioside synthesis and content of LAN-5 cells exposed for 6 days to 10 μMD-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (D-PDMP) (an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase) were reduced by ≫90%.

Even more extensive treatment of LAN-5 cells with 20 μMD-PDMP (6 day pretreatment followed by 6 days together with 10 μM retinoic acid) still did not block the retinoic acid-induced neurite formation.

We prepared a series of FGF-1 deletion mutants fused to the reporter gene, β-galactosidase (β-gal) and determined that a domain between residues 83 and 154 is responsible for FGF-1 cytosol retention in NIH 3T3 cells. Using a series of FGF-β-gal chimeric proteins prepared by the shuffling of cassette-formatted synthetic FGF prototype genes, we were able to demonstrate that the nuclear localization sequence from the 5′-CUG region of FGF-2 is not able to direct the nuclear association of FGF-1 due to its inability to repress the function of the FGF-1 cytosol retention domain. We also observed that while the FGF-1:β-gal chimera was released in response to heat shock, the FGF-2:β-gal protein was not. Further, replacement of the FGF-1 cytosol retention domain with the corresponding domain from FGF-2 repressed the release of the chimeric protein. These data suggest that the specificity of the stress-induced secretion pathway for FGF-1 involves a carboxyl-terminal domain that is absent in FGF-2 and that the FGF-1 secretion pathway does not restrict the release of high molecular weight forms of FGF-1.

Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Google Scholar, 2Friesel R.E. Maciag T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 919-925Google Scholar), and the biological functions of the FGF gene family members are mediated through high affinity FGF receptors, which contain intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (3Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-482Google Scholar). The FGF prototypes, FGF-1 (acidic) and FGF-2 (basic), lack a classical signal sequence for secretion through the conventional endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi apparatus, and the signal sequences present in other FGF gene family members contribute to their oncogenic potential (1Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Google Scholar, 2Friesel R.E. Maciag T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 919-925Google Scholar). Because the mitogenic potential of the FGF prototypes are mediated by the function of the FGF prototypes as exogenous proteins, it has been proposed that novel and unconventional secretory pathways may have evolved to regulate their activities as extracellular modifiers of biological responses (1Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Google Scholar, 2Friesel R.E. Maciag T.

We have shown that FGF-1 is secreted from NIH 3T3 cell FGF-1 transfectants by a brefeldin A-insensitive, ER-Golgi-independent pathway in response to heat shock (4Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Google Scholar, 5Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar). FGF-1 is released as a latent homodimer with reduced affinity for immobilized heparin (4Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Google Scholar), and both the mitogenic and heparin-binding activities of latent extracellular FGF-1 can be activated by reducing agents (5Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of Cys residues in FGF-1 enabled us to demonstrate that Cys30 is solely responsible for the formation of the FGF-1 homodimer (6Tarantini F. Gamble S. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29039-29042Google Scholar). In addition, FGF-1 is a phosphatidylserine-binding protein (6Tarantini F. Gamble S. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29039-29042Google Scholar), and FGF-1 at 42°C is able to attain a molten globule character, which enables it to associate with acidic phospholipid membranes (7Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9913-9920Google Scholar). In contrast, FGF-2 is also secreted by a brefeldin A-insensitive pathway (8Mignatti P. Morimoto T. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 81-93Google Scholar), and, although the Cys30 residue is conserved between FGF-1 and FGF-2 (1Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Google Scholar, 2Friesel R.E. Maciag T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 919-925Google Scholar), FGF-2 neither forms a homodimer (9Engleka K.A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11307-11315Google Scholar) nor is released in response to temperature stress in vitro (8Mignatti P. Morimoto T. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 81-93Google Scholar). Because it is possible that the FGF prototypes are released by different unconventional pathways, we sought to study the release of the FGF prototypes using a strategy of molecular shuffling of four synthetic cassettes, each encoding domains from FGF-1 (10Forough R. Engleka K. Thompson J.A. Jackson A. Imamura T. Maciag T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 293-298Google Scholar) and FGF-2 (11Imamura T. Friedman S.A. Gamble S. Tokita Y. Opalenik S.R. Thompson J.A. Maciag T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 124-130Google Scholar). This overlapping cassette shuffle strategy has previously enabled us to construct and express a variety of novel recombinant FGF-1:FGF-2 chimeric proteins and determine that residues 65-81 from FGF-2 significantly contribute to the heparin-dependent character of FGF-1 as an exogenous mitogen (11Imamura T. Friedman S.A. Gamble S. Tokita Y. Opalenik S.R. Thompson J.A. Maciag T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 124-130Google Scholar). We have utilized these constructs to obtain stable NIH 3T3 cell FGF-1:FGF-2 cassette shuffle transfectants and studied the intracellular locale and secretory potential of these constructs as β-galactosidase (β-gal) reporter gene fusion proteins. We report that the carboxyl-terminal half of FGF-1 (residues 84-154) is involved in cytosol retention and contributes to the ability of FGF-1 to be released in response to heat shock and that the corresponding domain in FGF-2 is responsible for the inability of FGF-2 to be released in response to temperature stress in vitro. Finally, we also report that there does not appear to be a molecular weight restriction for the size of FGF-1 released in response to temperature stress in vitro, and nuclear-associated FGF-1 does not have access to the FGF-1 secretory pathway. The construction of plasmids pXZ45 and pXZ55 were previously described (12Zhan X. Hu X.G. Friedman S. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 982-991Google Scholar). The plasmid pJS2, which contains residues 21-78 of the human FGF-1 gene, was constructed by ligating the 6673-base pair (bp) ScaI-EspI fragment of pXZ55 and the 3011-bp XmaI-EspI fragment of pXZ55 together. The ScaI digestion was partial, and both the ScaI and XmaI sites were filled in with Klenow fragment (Boehringer Mannheim). The plasmid pJS123, which contains residues 21-117 of the human FGF-1 gene, was constructed in four steps involving three intermediate constructs: pJS23temp, pJS23temp2, and pJS23temp3. The plasmid pJS23temp was constructed by ligating the BamHI fragment of pXZ55, which contains the β-gal fragment, into the HindIII site of pDS90 (10Forough R. Engleka K. Thompson J.A. Jackson A. Imamura T. Maciag T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 293-298Google Scholar). The ligation of the 5334-bp BamHI-SmaI fragment of pXZ55 and the BamHI-SnaBI fragment of pJS23temp, which contains residues 38-117 of the human FGF-1 gene, generated pJS23temp2. The ligation of the 2138-bp BglII-EspI fragment of pXZ55 and the 7591-bp BglII-EspI fragment of pJS23temp2 generated pJS23temp3. Finally, the pJS123 was generated by ligating the 7909-bp ScaI fragment of pJS23temp3 with the 1905-bp ScaI fragment of pXZ55. The plasmid pJS5, which contains residues 28-154 of the human FGF-1 gene, was constructed by ligating the ScaI-NheI fragment of pXZ31 (12Zhan X. Hu X.G. Friedman S. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 982-991Google Scholar) and the 5702-bp ScaI-HindIII fragment of pXZ55 with the 3556-bp HindIII-NheI fragment of pXZ55. The plasmids pSF25 and pSF26 were constructed in a multistep process involving intermediate plasmids pSF20 and pSF21. The plasmid pSF20 was constructed by oligonucleotide mutagenesis. The resulting clone is similar to hstβ:pMEXneo (13Forough R. Zhan X. MacPhee M. Friedman S. Engleka K.A. Sayers T. Wiltrout R.H. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2960-2968Google Scholar) except for five single base changes resulting in Cys30→ Ser (codon changes TGT → TCT), Phe36→ Ser (TTC → TCC), Glu63→ Asp (GAA → GAT), Cys97→ Ser (TGT → TCT), and Cys131→ Ser (TGC → TCC) mutations in the human FGF-1 open-reading frame (ORF). The plasmid pSF21 was constructed by filling in the annealed oligonucleotides 5′-TACAAGGGATCCTCAGG(G/A)AGTGGCCCCCGTTGCTA(G/C)AGTAGAGGAGTTTGGGCTT-3′ and 5′-GGGAAATACGTAGTCGACCTCGAGACCACCATGGCTAATTACAAGAAGCCCAAAC-3′ with DNA polymerase, digestion with SalI-BamHI, and ligation to the large SalI-BamHI fragment of pSF20. The oligonucleotide bases in parenthesis are 50% mixtures at C30S and F36S positions, and pSF21 contains the wild-type bases at these positions. The plasmid pSF25, which contains residues 21-39 and 77-154 of the human FGF-1 gene, was constructed by ligating annealed oligonucleotides sense, 5′-GATCCGCCAGTACTTGGC-3′, and antisense, 5′-CATGGCCAAGTACTGGCG-3′ (BamHI-NcoI ends), with the 3329-bp NcoI-KpnI fragment of pXZ55 and the large BamHI-KpnI fragment of pSF21. The plasmid pSF26, which contains residues 21-40 and 112-154 of the human FGF-1 gene, was constructed by ligating the annealed oligonucleotides antisense, 5′-CTTCTTGGATATAAG-3′, and sense, 5′-GATCCTTATATCCAAGAAGCATG-3′ (BamHI-SphI ends), with the 3222-bp SphI-KpnI fragment of pXZ55 and the BamHI-KpnI fragment of pSF21. The plasmid pJS9, which contains residues 21-81 of the human FGF-1 gene and residues 85-155 of the FGF-2 gene, was constructed in two steps. The plasmid pJS9temp was generated by ligating the PpuMI-AvaI fragment of pT70405 (11Imamura T. Friedman S.A. Gamble S. Tokita Y. Opalenik S.R. Thompson J.A. Maciag T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 124-130Google Scholar) and the large AvaI-NheI fragment of pT70405 with four annealed oligonucleotides: sense, 5′-GACCTGGGCAGAAAGCTATACTTTTTCTTC-3′; sense, 5′-CAATGTCTGCTAAGAGCAGTTTAAACCCCGGGAGTCTG-3′; antisense, 5′-CTAGCAGACTCCCGGGGTTTAAACTGCTCTTA-3′; and antisense, 5′-GCAGACATTGGAAGAAAAAGTATAGCTTTCTGCCCAG-3′ (PpuMI-NheI ends). The plasmid pJS9 was made by ligating the 343-bp BspEI-SmaI fragment of pJS9temp and the 6663-bp BspEI-EspI fragment of pXZ55 with the EspI-SmaI fragment of pXZ55, which contains the β-gal gene. The plasmid pJS22temp was constructed by ligating the 1038-bp NdeI-BclI fragment of pSK(−)SVTC (SV40 large T antigen ORF; a kind gift from Dr. Daniel Simmon) (14Lin H.-J. Upson R.H. Simmon D.T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5443-5452Google Scholar) and the 2900-bp BamHI-SacI fragment of pSK(−)SVTC with the NdeI-SacI fragment of the polymerase chain reaction product of pSK(−)SVTC generated with primers: sense, 5′-GCATAGAGCTCGGCGCGCCATGGATAAAGTTTTAA-3′, and antisense, 5′-ACAGCCTGTTGGCATATGGTTT-3′. The plasmid pJS22 was constructed by ligating the 9775-bp AscI-BspEI fragment of pXZ55 and the AscI-BspHI fragment of pJS22temp, which contains the SV40T gene, with four annealed oligonucleotides: sense, 5′-CATGATGCTAATTACAAGAAGCCCAAACTCCTCTA-3′; sense, 5′-CTGTAGCAACGGGGGCCACTTCCTGAGGATCCTT-3′; antisense, 5′-CCGGAAGGATCCTCAGGAAGTGGCCCCC-3′; and antisense, 5′-GTTGCTACAGTAGAGGAGTTTGGGCTTCTTGTAATTAGCAT-3′ (BspEI-BspHI ends). The plasmid pJS8temp was generated by ligation of the PpuMI-AvaI fragment of pTI70407 (11Imamura T. Friedman S.A. Gamble S. Tokita Y. Opalenik S.R. Thompson J.A. Maciag T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 124-130Google Scholar) and the large AvaI-NheI fragment of pTI70407 with four annealed oligonucleotides: sense, 5′-GACCTGGGCAGAAAGCTATACTTTTTCTTC-3′; sense, 5′-CAATGTCTGCTAAGAGCAGTTTAAACCCCGGGAGTCTG-3′; antisense, 5′-CTAGCAGACTCCCGGGGTTTAAACTGCTCTTA-3′; and antisense, 5′-GCAGACATTGGAAGAAAAAGTATAGCTTTCTGCCCAG-3′ (PpuMI-NheI ends). The plasmid pJS8, which contains residues 21-117 of the human FGF-1 gene and residues 120-155 of the human FGF-2 gene, was constructed by ligation of three DNA fragments: the 343-bp BspEI-SmaI fragment of pJS8temp, the 6563-bp BspEI-EspI fragment of pXZ55, and the EspI-SmaI fragment of pXZ55. The plasmid pJS7, which contains residues 21-81 and 118-154 of the human FGF-1 gene and residues 85-120 of the human FGF-2 gene, was prepared by ligating the 6563-bp EspI-BspEI fragment of pXZ55 and the 3129-bp EspI-SphI fragment of pXZ55 with the 225-bp BspEI-SphI fragment of pTI70406 (11Imamura T.

The plasmid pJS20temp was constructed by ligating the 6570-bp XhoI-EspI fragment of pJS14 and the NcoI-EspI fragment of pXZ55, which contains the β-gal fragment, with the XhoI-NcoI fragment of the polymerase chain reaction product of pJS10 generated with the following primers: sense, 5′-GCAGCCTCGAGTTCCCACCGGTCCACT3′, and antisense, 5′-CCATCTTCCTCCATGGCCAGGTAAC-3′. The plasmid pJS20, which contains the NLS from the human FGF-2 gene, residues 1-85 from the human FGF-2 gene, and residues 82-154 from the human FGF-1 gene, was constructed by ligating the 6570-bp XhoI-EspI fragment of pJS20temp and the 3420-bp AgeI-EspI fragment of pJS20temp with four annealed oligonucleotides: sense, 5′-TCGAGGATCAAGACCTGGCCCGGGTGCAGCCGGGA-3′; sense, 5′-GCATCACCACGCTGCCCGCCTTGCCCGAGGATGGCGGCAGCGGCGCCTTCCCA-3′; antisense, 5′-CCGGTGGGAAGGCGCCGCTGCCGCCATCCTCGGGCAAGGCGGGCAGC-3′; antisense, 5′-GTGGTGATGCTCCCGGCTGCACCCGGGCCAGGTCTTGATCC-3′ (AgeI-XhoI ends). The plasmid pJS30, which contains the sequence from the human FGF-2 gene starting from the upstream alternative CUG translational site, was constructed by ligating the NcoI-EspI fragment of pJS14 and the NcoI-XhoI fragment of pJS20 containing the amino-terminal half of human FGF-2 with the large XhoI-EspI fragment of pJS20.

NIH 3T3 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum (Hyclone), and 1 × antibiotic-antimycotic (Life Technologies). Transfection was performed using the CaPO4 transfection protocol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) as described previously (12Zhan X. Hu X.G. Friedman S. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 982-991Google Scholar). Individual transfected clones were selected and expanded by growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum, 1 × antibiotic-antimycotic, and 800 μg/ml geneticin (G418) (Life Technologies). Immunofluorescence was performed on NIH 3T3 cell transfectants grown on fibronectin-coated chamber slides (Nunc Inc.) as described previously (16Wessendorf J.H.M. Garfinkel S. Zhan X. Brown S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22100-22104Google Scholar). X-gal staining was performed on 70% confluent monolayers of NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the plasmid of interest as described previously (16Wessendorf J.H.M. Garfinkel S. Zhan X. Brown S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22100-22104Google Scholar). The subcellular fractionation of NIH 3T3 cell transfectants was performed as described previously (12Zhan X. Hu X.G. Friedman S. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 982-991Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were scraped, centrifuged, and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (15 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM sucrose, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). After incubation on ice for 10 min, the cells were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatants were labeled as cytosol, and the nuclear pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A and centrifuged (800 × g, 10 min, 4°C) through a 3-ml sucrose cushion (buffer A containing 350 mM sucrose). The nuclear pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A containing 0.4% (w/v) SDS, 8 mM MgCl2, and 10 units of DNase and incubated for 5 min at 37°C followed by 15 min at room temperature. Both the nuclear and cytosol fractions were cleared by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min, 4°C). Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating either the cytosol or nuclear fractions with 1 μl of anti-β-gal antibody (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) and rotating for 1 h at 4°C, followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (50% (w/v); Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and rotating for 1 h at 4°C. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) and extracted with 20 μl of 2 × SDS-sample buffer (6.25 mM Tris, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 3 mM SDS, 1%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.75 mM bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) at 95°C for 3 min. Samples were resolved by 7.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to a 0.45-μm Hybond C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Corp.). Immunoblot analysis was performed by incubating the membranes with TBS buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 containing 5% (w/v) BSA for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with anti-β-gal antibody (1:500 dilution in TBS buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times with TBS, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) (1:30,000 dilution) for 30 min, and washed three times with TBS, and the proteins were detected using the ECL detection system (Amersham). Heat shock experiments were performed as described previously (4Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were grown on fibronectin-coated plates. The medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (serum-free) prior to heat shock, and the cells were incubated at 42°C for 2 h. The conditioned medium was collected, filtered through a 0.22-μm filter (Corning), activated with 0.1% (w/v) dithiothreitol for 2 h at 37°C, and processed over a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose-4B (Pharmacia) column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM EDTA (TEB). The column was washed with 50 ml of TEB and eluted with 2.5 ml of 1.5 M NaCl in TEB. The cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, sonicated for 15 s, clarified by centrifugation at 4°C, and processed over a heparin-Sepharose-4B column as described previously (5Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar). Both cell lysate and conditioned medium eluates were concentrated through a Centricon 10 (Amicon), resolved by 7.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by immunoblot analysis using anti-β-gal antibodies. NIH 3T3 cell transfectants incubated for 2 h at 37°C were used as controls. The nomenclature for the human FGF-1 and FGF-2 plasmid discussion utilizes the subscript number to describe the FGF cassette number employed in the construction of the individual reporter gene sequence (10Forough R. Engleka K. Thompson J.A. Jackson A. Imamura T. Maciag T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 293-298Google Scholar, 11Imamura T. Friedman S.A. Gamble S. Tokita Y. Opalenik S.R. Thompson J.A. Maciag T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 124-130Google Scholar). The residues used to describe the FGF-1 and FGF-2 sequences are based upon the translation of the FGF prototypes as AUG-initiated translation products (1Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Google Scholar). We have previously prepared a synthetic human FGF-1 gene by the ligation of four cassettes encoding the FGF-1 ORF (10Forough R. Engleka K. Thompson J.A. Jackson A. Imamura T. Maciag T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 293-298Google Scholar) and have reported that while the ligation of the FGF-1 NLS, NYKKPK (residues 21-26), to the reporter gene, β-gal, efficiently translocates the fusion protein, FGF-1(1):β-gal to the nucleus in transfected NIH 3T3 cells, the FGF-1(1-2-3-4):β-gal fusion product remains cytosol-associated (12Zhan X. Hu X.G. Friedman S. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 982-991Google Scholar, Fig. 1A-D). Because these data suggest that FGF-1 may contain a domain that is able to repress the intracellular function of the FGF-1 NLS, we (i) prepared a series of FGF-1:β-gal deletion constructs (Fig. 1A), (ii) obtained stable NIH 3T3 cell transfectants, and (iii) assessed the intracellular locale of the reporter gene by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1B), X-gal staining (Fig. 1C), and subcellular fractionation followed by anti-β-gal immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1D). While the deletion of either cassettes 3 and 4 (residues 84-154) or the deletion of cassette 4 (residues 118-154) does not repress the trafficking of the reporter gene to the nucleus (Fig. 1, A-D), the ligation of cassettes 3 and 4 to the FGF-1 NLS in cassette 1 does repress the trafficking of the reporter gene to the nucleus (Fig. 1, A-D). These data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal half of FGF-1 is involved in the cytosol retention of FGF-1, and residues 84-154 may be important for this function. In order to determine whether the temperature stress-induced FGF secretion pathway is utilized by FGF-1 and FGF-2, NIH 3T3 cell FGF-1(1-2-3-4):β-gal and FGF-2(1-2-3-4):β-gal transfectants (Fig. 2A) were examined for their ability to release the growth factor:reporter gene chimera in response to heat shock. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the FGF-1(1-2-3-4):β-gal, but not the FGF-2(1-2-3-4):β-gal chimeric protein, was released in response to heat shock as a structurally intact polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 118 kDa. These data suggest that the temperature stress-induced pathway is specific for FGF-1 and that this pathway can release FGF-1 as a large molecular weight reporter gene chimeric protein.Fig. 3Secretion of FGF-1:FGF-2:β-Gal fusion proteins from NIH 3T3 cell transfectants in response to heat shock. β-gal immunoblot analysis of NIH 3T3 cell transfectant medium conditioned by heat shock was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Control (37°C) and heat shock (42°C) samples from lysates (panel A) and conditioned medium (panel B) are shown below the immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the temperature stress-induced secretion pathway appears to be specific for FGF-1, we used a cassette shuffle strategy to assess whether specific domains are involved in the release of FGF-1. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the substitution of either cassette 3 or 4 from FGF-2 for the corresponding cassette in FGF-1 (Fig. 2A) inhibited the release of the FGF-1(1-2-3):FGF-2(4):β-gal and FGF-1(1-2-4):FGF-2(3):β-gal chimeric proteins in response to temperature stress from their respective NIH 3T3 cell transfectants. In addition, the introduction of cassettes 3 and 4 from FGF-2 as replacement for their corresponding cassettes in FGF-1 (Fig. 2A) also inhibited the release of FGF-1(1-2):FGF-2(3-4):β-gal (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, the majority of stable NIH 3T3 cell transfectants exhibited similar staining as shown in Fig. 2B by X-gal staining and by β-gal immunofluorescence (data not shown). These data suggest that the domain comprising residues 84-154 from FGF-1 may be involved in the regulation of FGF-1 secretion and that the corresponding domain in FGF-2 is able to repress the release of the FGF reporter gene chimera in response to heat shock. FGF-2 (17Bugler B. Amalric F. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 573-577Google Scholar, 18Florkiewicz R.Z. Sommer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3978-3981Google Scholar) and FGF-3 (19Acland P. Dixon M. Peters G. Dickson C. Nature. 1990; 343: 662-665Google Scholar, 20Kiefer P. Acland P. Pappin D. Peters G. Dickson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4126-4136Google Scholar) are able to utilize alternative 5′-CUG translation initiation start sites, which are able to direct the intracellular traffic of these translation products to the nucleus. Because FGF-1 does not contain this feature (21Jaye M. Howk R. Burgess W.H. Ricca G.A. Chiu I.-M. Ravera M.W. O'Brien S.J. Modi W.S. Maciag T. Drohan W.N. Science. 1986; 233: 541-545Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether the FGF-1 cytosol retention domain would repress the ability of the multiple NLS domain encoded by the FGF-2 alternative 5′-CUG translational initiation sequence to traffic FGF-1 to the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, the addition of this multiple NLS domain to the synthetic FGF-2 gene inhibited the ability of the reporter gene to remain cytosol-associated and directed the FGF-2:β-gal chimeric protein to the nucleus in the NIH 3T3 cell transfectants. Likewise, the replacement of cassettes 1 and 2 in FGF-2 with the corresponding cassettes from FGF-1 also enabled the reporter gene to translocate to the nucleus (Fig. 2, B and C). However, the replacement cassettes 3 and 4 in FGF-2 with the corresponding cassettes from FGF-1 not only inhibited the nuclear traffic of the reporter gene (Fig. 2, B and C) but enabled the chimera to be released from the NIH 3T3 cell transfectants in response to heat shock (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that the domain in FGF-1 responsible for cytosol retention is able to repress the nuclear trafficking properties of the multiple NLS domain present in the alternative 5′-CUG-initiated high molecular weight FGF-2 translation product. In order to determine whether nuclear-associated FGF-1 is able to access the FGF-1 secretion pathway, an additional construct was prepared in which the entire SV40T ORF was ligated in-frame at the 5′-end of the FGF-1:β-gal ORF, and the intracellular traffic and stress-induced release of the translation product was assessed. As shown in Figs. 2C and 3, A and B, the SV40T:FGF-1:β-gal chimera was nucleus-associated and was not released in response to heat shock following expression in NIH 3T3 cells. These data suggest that the domain responsible for FGF-1 cytosol retention may have evolved to ensure participation of FGF-1 in the temperature stress-induced secretion pathway. The FGF prototype cassette shuffle strategy has enabled us not only to confirm the specificity of the FGF-1 secretion pathway induced by temperature stress (4Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Google Scholar, 5Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar, 6Tarantini F. Gamble S. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29039-29042Google Scholar), but it has also enabled us to determine the importance between the FGF prototype carboxyl-terminal domains as a structural correlate for this specificity. Indeed, the similarities between the FGF prototypes within this domain are accentuated by the ability of these sequences to act as potential cytosol retention domains that are able to repress the function of the NLS in their respective AUG-initiated translation products. However, differences within this domain between the FGF prototypes are revealed by the ability of the FGF-1-derived domain to repress the function of the NLS in the 5′-CUG-initiated translation products and the ability of the FGF-2 domain to repress the release of FGF-1 in response to heat shock. It is also noteworthy that the carboxyl-terminal domain in FGF-1 is involved in the association between FGF-1 and phosphatidylserine (6Tarantini F. Gamble S. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29039-29042Google Scholar). Further, our ability to study the secretion of the FGF prototype homologs as chimeric proteins, as well as the inability of FGF-2 to be secreted under conditions where FGF-1 release is readily apparent, serves to reduce concerns relative to the potential artifactual nature of this unconventional, brefeldin A-insensitive (5Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Google Scholar), stress-induced FGF-1 secretion pathway. Previous FGF-1 mutagenesis studies have identified the importance of Cys30 in the formation of the stress-induced FGF-1 homodimer (6Tarantini F. Gamble S. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29039-29042Google Scholar), and we have proposed that temperature stress may enable Cys30 to gain access to solvent for homodimer formation. Indeed, Cys30 is conserved in FGF-2 (1Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Google Scholar); yet, interestingly, FGF chimeric proteins containing the carboxyl-terminal domain from FGF-2 also contain Cys30 but are not secreted in response to heat shock. Thus, we suggest that the carboxyl-terminal domain in FGF-2 may prevent solvent accessibility of Cys30 for FGF-2 homodimer formation under temperature stress conditions, and this feature may be involved in determining the specificity between the FGF prototypes for secretion in response to heat shock. This is consistent with the ability of FGF-1 but not FGF-2 to undergo Cu2+-induced homodimer formation (9Engleka K.A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11307-11315Google Scholar) and heparin-induced conformational changes (11Imamura T. Friedman S.A. Gamble S. Tokita Y. Opalenik S.R. Thompson J.A. Maciag T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 124-130Google Scholar), although FGF-1 and FGF-2 are both Cu2+-and heparin-binding proteins (9Engleka K.A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11307-11315Google Scholar). The forced nuclear traffic of intracellular FGF-1 by SV40T is also noteworthy, since it was difficult to obtain stable NIH 3T3 cell transfectants using the NLS from either the SV40 large T antigen or histone 2B genes to force the nuclear traffic of intracellular FGF-1 as a result of their diminished proliferative capacity in vitro (data not shown). Indeed, this is consistent with the reports that the nuclear traffic of intracellular FGF-2 (22Quarto N. Talarico D. Florkiewicz R. Rifkin D.B. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 699-708Google Scholar) and FGF-3 (23Kiefer P. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4364-4374Google Scholar) as a result of alternative 5′-CUG translation initiation also results in a reduction of proliferative capacity in vitro and may help explain why the AUG-initiated FGF prototype translation products are localized in the cytosol. Since FGF-1 gains access to the nuclear compartment as a result of its receptor-dependent traffic from the cell surface (12Zhan X. Hu X.G. Friedman S. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 982-991Google Scholar), we suggest that the nuclear traffic of FGF-1 during the entire G1 period of the cell cycle (24Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Google Scholar) may function, in part, to restrict endocytotic FGF-1 from participation in the FGF-1 secretion pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1997985924,"The active site of class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases contains the motif 2 loop, which is involved in binding of ATP, amino acid, and the acceptor end of tRNA. In order to characterize the active site of Saccharomyces cerevisiae seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS), we performed in vitro mutagenesis of the portion of the SES1 gene encoding the motif 2 loop. Substitutions of amino acids conserved in the motif 2 loop of seryl-tRNA synthetases from other sources led to loss of complementation of a yeast SES1 null allele strain by the mutant yeast SES1 genes. Steady-state kinetic analyses of the purified mutant SerRS proteins revealed elevated K m values for serine and ATP, accompanied by decreases in k cat (as expected for replacement of residues involved in aminoacyl-adenylate formation). The differences in the affinities for serine and ATP, in the absence and presence of tRNA are consistent with the proposed conformational changes induced by positioning the 3′-end of tRNA into the active site, as observed recently in structural studies of Thermus thermophilus SerRS (Cusack, S., Yaremchuk, A., and Tukalo, M.

The crystal structure of this moderately homologous prokaryotic counterpart of the yeast enzyme allowed us to produce a model of the yeast SerRS structure and to place the mutations in a structural context.

The formation of aminoacyl-tRNA, catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, is a crucial step in maintaining the fidelity of protein biosynthesis. This family of enzymes can be partitioned into two classes of 10 enzymes each, based on conserved sequences (1Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Google Scholar) and structural motifs (2Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Härtlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature. 1990; 347: 249-255Google Scholar). All members of class I contain a common loop with the signature sequence KMSKS (3Houtondji C. Dessen P. Blanquet S. Biochimie. 1986; 68: 1071-1078Google Scholar) and a region of homology with the HIGH peptide (4Webster T. Tsai H. Kula M. Mackie G.A. Schimmel P.

Class II synthetases have a different topology of dinucleotide binding based on antiparallel β-sheets (2Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Härtlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R.

In contrast to their prokaryotic counterparts, these enzymes contain C-terminal extensions abundant in basic amino acids, which may be important for both stability and optimal substrate recognition in eukaryotic SerRS, 1The abbreviation used is: SerRSseryl-tRNA synthetase. as recently shown for yeast SerRS (29Weygand-Durašević I. Lenhard B. Filipić S. Söll D. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 2455-2461Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the mechanisms of substrate recognition employed by yeast SerRS and to identify catalytically important residues in the active site, we have replaced a number of amino acids in the motif 2 loop and analyzed the resulting mutants in vivo and in vitro. The altered kinetic parameters of the mutant SerRS proteins correlate with predictions based upon structural studies of the prokaryotic system. seryl-tRNA synthetase. [3H]Serine (30.0 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp. [14C]Serine (166.1 mCi/mmol) and tetrasodium [32P]pyrophosphate (3.09 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. In vitro mutagenesis of the SES1 gene was carried out (see below) in pBluescript SK(−), where the BamHI cassette containing SES1 (30Weygand-Durašević I. Ban N. Jahn D. Söll D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 869-877Google Scholar) was inserted, giving pSKSES1. The resulting mutant SES1 genes, named SES1 mut, were recloned as 1.4-kilobase pair BamHI fragments into pVTL-100 behind the ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase) promoter and pCJ11 behind the GAL promoter for complementation of the null-allele strains, or in pET3 behind the T7 RNA polymerase promoter for overproduction of mutated proteins in E. coli (29Weygand-Durašević I. Lenhard B. Filipić S. Söll D. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 2455-2461Google Scholar, 30Weygand-Durašević I. Ban N. Jahn D. Söll D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 869-877Google Scholar). Construction of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SES1 disruption strain BR2727ΔSES1 (MAT a ade2-1 arg4-9 his4 leu2-3, 112 lys2 trp1 ura3-1 SES1::LYS2) has been described (29Weygand-Durašević I. Lenhard B. Filipić S. Söll D. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 2455-2461Google Scholar). The deletion could be rescued by supplying a functional SES1 gene on a centromeric plasmid pUN70 (29Weygand-Durašević I. Lenhard B. Filipić S. Söll D. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 2455-2461Google Scholar). Selected haploids with a disrupted SES1 gene (Lys+ phenotype), where SerRS function was provided in trans (from pUN70SES1 plasmid), were used for complementation experiments via plasmid shuffling involving pVTL-100SES1 mut. Since the parental strain BR2727 was not fully galactose-inducible, as shown by its inability to ferment galactose after streaking the colonies on bromthymol blue indicator plates (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% agar, 2% galactose, and 80 mg/liter bromthymol blue; 31Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar), pUN70SES1 transformants of BR2727ΔSES1 were crossed with S. cerevisiae S2088 (MATα ura3-52 trp 1 lys2-801 leu2Δ1 his3-Δ200 pep4::HIS3 prb-Δ1.6R can 1 GAL). Diploids were sporulated, tetrads dissected, and haploid segregants of the pUN70SES1 transformant with a disrupted SES1 gene (Lys+ phenotype) and the ability to ferment galactose (produce a yellow halo on indicator plates) were selected. The strain was named SD816 and used for complementation experiments via plasmid exchange with pCJ11SES1 mut. Saturation mutagenesis was performed with a 5:1 molar ratio of synthetic phosphorylated oligonucleotides to U-containing single-stranded pSKSES1 DNA. A mutagenic oligonucleotide, a 50-mer complementary to the codons corresponding to amino acids 278-294, was synthesized doped to 4% with an equal mixture of A/C/G/T at all positions. A new NcoI restriction site was introduced internally by silent mutations to allow screening by restriction analysis. Annealing, extension, and ligation of the mutagenic mixture was as described (32Weygand-Durašević I. Schwob E. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 210-214Google Scholar). After transformation of E. coli DH5α, plasmid DNA was isolated from a large pool of individual transformants. The pertinent regions of all NcoI-containing pSKSES1 plasmids were subjected to sequencing in order to determine the mutational changes. Multiple mutations in the SES1 gene were separated by exchanging either 880-base pair PstI/NcoI or 560-base pair NcoI/EagI fragments with the corresponding fragments of pSKSES1 wt. The overproduction of mutated SerRS enzymes was achieved by transformation of E. coli strain BL21(DE3) with pET3SES1 mut constructs, followed by induction of the cultures with 2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. The enzymes were purified by a two-step chromatographic procedure on FPLC MonoQ and MonoS columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described previously (30Weygand-Durašević I. Ban N. Jahn D. Söll D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 869-877Google Scholar). The extent of adenylate formation catalyzed by the purified enzymes was assessed by pyrophosphate exchange at 30°C (33Calendar R. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1681-1690Google Scholar). The reaction was performed in a buffer consisting of 100 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM [32P]PPi (1-2 cpm/pmol), 10 mM KF, containing various amounts of the substrate studied (serine or ATP), while the other substrate was kept saturating (serine at 5 mM, Mg-ATP at 2 mM (molar ratio 1:1)). Typical concentrations of the substrate studied were from 0.1 to 10 times K m. The concentration of wild-type enzyme was 45 nM, while the mutants were used in a concentration range from 45 to 450 nM. Aminoacylation was done at 30°C as described previously (29Weygand-Durašević I. Lenhard B. Filipić S. Söll D. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 2455-2461Google Scholar) in reaction mixtures containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mM MgCl2, 4 mM dithiothreitol. For all kinetic assays, the concentrations of the substrate studied ([3H]serine, Mg-ATP, or tRNASer) were varied from 0.1 to 10 times K m. Saturating concentrations of other substrates were: 5 mM ATP, 12 mg/ml unfractionated brewer's yeast tRNA (Boehringer Mannheim), which corresponds to approximately 20 mM tRNASer, and 1 mM 3H- or 14C-labeled serine. To correct for the low counting efficiency of the free [3H]Ser in comparison to that of [3H]Ser-tRNA, total charging assays with either 3H- or 14C-labeled Ser were performed in parallel so that the conversion factor could be calculated. Enzyme concentrations were 94 nM for wild-type SerRS and 94-470 nM for mutants. Kinetic parameters were determined from Hanes-Woolf plots. All values represent the average of three independent determinations, which varied by less than 10%. Multiple alignment of protein sequences was performed using CLUSTALW (34Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar). The PHYLIP package (35Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar) was used to calculate protein distance matrices and to construct phylogenetic trees. Percent similarities between proteins were calculated by the method of Myers and Miller (36Myers E.W. Miller W. Comp. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 11-17Google Scholar). Theoretical models of the yeast SerRS three-dimensional structure were produced and optimized using the PROMOD program suite (37Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Google Scholar). 2The PROMOD program suite is implemented on the Internet via the SwissModel server (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/swissmod/SWISSMODEL.html). Images were produced using RasMol Molecular Renderer version 2.6. There is significant similarity among the primary structures of all known SerRS proteins. Pairwise similarities range from 26% between S. cerevisiae cytoplasmic and a recently identified S. cerevisiae putative second SerRS (28Johnston M. Andrews S. Brinkman R. Cooper J. Ding H. Dover J. Du Z. Favello A. Fulton L. Gattung S. Geisel C. Kirsten J. Kucaba T. Hillier L. Jier M. Johnston L. Langston Y.St. Latreille P. Louis E.J. Macri C. Mardis E. Menezes S. Mouser L. Nhan M. Rifkin L. Riles L. Peter H. Trevaskis E. Vaughan K. Vignati D. Wilcox L. Wohldman P. Waterston R. Wilson R. Vaudin M. Science. 1994; 265: 2077-2082Google Scholar) to 78% between E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae SerRS. The second yeast SerRS is most likely a mitochondrial enzyme. This is based on its position in the phylogenetic tree, the presence of a putative N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (as diagnosed by multiple sequence alignment, and with high confidence by the method of Nakai and Kanehisa; 38Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Google Scholar) 3This method for analyzing and predicting protein sorting signals coded in amino acid sequence is implemented on the Internet as a part of the PSORT WWW server (http://psort.nibb.ac.jp/). and the lack of a C-terminal extension (29Weygand-Durašević I. Lenhard B. Filipić S. Söll D. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 2455-2461Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree showing evolutionary relationships among seryl-tRNA synthetases from different organisms is presented in Fig. 1. The cytoplasmic enzymes of eukaryotes form a separate group, and the divergence pattern of eubacterial enzymes is in accord with the contemporary phylogenetic trees (39Brown J.R. Doolittle W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2441-2445Google Scholar). Surprisingly, an archaeal SerRS (Haloarcula marismortui) clusters with the enzymes of B. subtilis and the three Gram-negative bacteria regardless of the method used to construct the tree. This suggests that, at some point in evolution, a eubacterial gene for SerRS replaced the ancestral H. marismortui gene by horizontal transfer. In spite of primary sequence similarity, immunological cross-reactivity has been observed neither between eukaryotic and prokaryotic seryl-tRNA synthetases nor between the cytoplasmic and organellar proteins (40Weygand-Durašević I. Jerala R. Period. Biol. 1990; 92: 295-304Google Scholar, 41Sidorik L.L. Gudzera O.I. Dragovoz D.A. Tukalo M.A. Beresten S.F. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 76-78Google Scholar). As revealed by the crystal structures of two prokaryotic seryl-tRNA synthetases from E. coli (2Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Härtlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature. 1990; 347: 249-255Google Scholar) and T. thermophilus (42Fujinaga M. Berthet-Colominas C. Yaremchuk A.D. Tukalo M.A. Cusack S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 222-233Google Scholar), each subunit of the homodimeric enzymes is composed of two domains: an N-terminal “helical arm” comprising a 60-Å solvent-exposed, antiparallel coiled-coil, which binds the variable arm of cognate tRNASer (12Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Google Scholar, 43Price S. Cusack S. Borel F. Berthet-Colominas C. Leberman R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 167-170Google Scholar) and the catalytic domain based on a seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. The mode of seryl-adenylate binding in the active site is also known from crystallographic and solution studies (10Belrhali H. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Larsen K. Berthet-Colominas C. Leberman R. Beijer B. Sproat B. Als-Nielsen J. Grübel G. Legrand J.-F. Lehmann M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1432-1436Google Scholar, 11Belrhali H. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Berthet-Colominas C. Rasmussen B. Bösecke P. Diat O. Cusack S. Structure. 1995; 3: 341-352Google Scholar, 13Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Google Scholar). However, none of the eukaryotic seryl-tRNA synthetases have yet been crystallized, nor is there any information on substrate binding domains and catalytic sites from biochemical experiments. In our search for the active site of yeast SerRS, we have performed saturation in vitro mutagenesis of the portion of the SES1 gene encoding the domain that in the model structure based upon the coordinates of SerRS from T. thermophilus (Fig. 2), corresponds to the active site loop in motif 2 (residues 278-294 in yeast SerRS) (Fig. 2). As shown by primary sequence alignment (Fig. 3), this is the most conserved region among all SerRS proteins.Fig. 3A, sequence alignment of SerRS motif 2 regions. Abbreviations used are the same as in Fig. 1. Fully conserved residues are shown in bold. B, the type and the position of amino acid changes in mutant yeast SerRSs. Saturation mutagenesis was performed using oligonucleotides complementary to the codons corresponding to amino acids 278-294 (shaded) in yeast SerRS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) From the many SerRS mutants isolated, which carry one to five amino acid substitutions in region 278-294 of the motif 2 loop, we wanted to select those with the most severely affected substrate binding or catalytic properties. This was first assessed in vivo by the ability of the mutants to complement S. cerevisiae SES1 null-allele strains via plasmid shuffling (Table I). The haploid strain BR2727ΔSES1 (where viability of the cell is ensured by a wild-type SES1 gene on the URA3-containing plasmid pUN70SES1), was transformed with pVTL-100SES1 mut constructs (which carry the LEU2-selectable marker and SES1 mut behind the ADH promoter). Four of the motif 2 loop mutants were found to have lost the ability to complement the ΔSES1 null allele. They were named SES1 mut2, SES1 mut3, SES1 mut4, and SES1 mut5. The type and the position of mutational changes in the resulting SerRS proteins are presented in Fig. 3 B. In order to check whether the function of wild-type SerRS can be restored by the overproduction of mutated SerRS proteins, the complementation of S. cerevisiae SD816 (which also carries an inactivated SES1::LYS2 allele but has a normal galactose uptake), was performed via plasmid shuffling with pCJ11SES1 mut constructs. After induction of the GAL promoter by switching the cultures of SD816/pCJ11SES mut from glucose to galactose medium, significant amounts of mutant proteins accumulated in the cell, as detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis of protein extracts (not shown). pUN70SES1 was cured by growing induced double transformants in the presence of uracil, followed by plating the cells on selective galactose plates. Lys+Leu+ colonies were replica-plated to 5-fluoro-orotic acid-containing medium (31Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar), which counterselects against colonies containing URA3 plasmids carrying the wild-type S. cerevisiae SES1 gene. Some very slow growing transformants of pCJ11SES1 mut4 and pCJ11SES1 mut5 appeared on 5-fluoro-orotic acid plates after several days of incubation at 30°C, while all the cells containing pCJ11SES1 mut2 or pCJ11SES1 mut3 as the only source of seryl-tRNA synthetase activity were nonviable (Table I). It is thus apparent that several amino acid substitutions between residues 278 and 294 of yeast SerRS are responsible for enzyme inactivation and consequently for the phenotypic alteration.Table I.In vivo activity of SerRS mutantsGeneComplementationa+, complementation of the SES1 null-allele strains BR2727ΔSES1 with pVTL-100SES1mut or SD816 with pCJ11SES1mut; −, no complementation; ±−, marginal complementation (minimal growth).Accumulation in the cellb+, full-length protein detected by Western blot analysis at a level comparable to SerRSwt when expressed from the same vector.

Open table in a new tab To determine the steps of the aminoacylation reaction at which the altered enzymes are defective, noncomplementing (SES1 mut2 and SES1 mut3) or weakly complementing mutants (SES1 mut4 and SES1 mut5) which normally accumulate in yeast cells (Table I) were overexpressed in E. coli, purified to apparent homogeneity as described under “Materials and Methods,” and characterized in vitro. As discussed previously (29Weygand-Durašević I. Lenhard B. Filipić S. Söll D. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 2455-2461Google Scholar), there are some indications that S. cerevisiae SerRS purified from bacterial overproducing strains may differ in modification and/or conformation compared to the native protein. However, since the kinetic parameters for overexpressed yeast SerRS are very much alike regardless of the overproducing system used (29Weygand-Durašević I. Lenhard B. Filipić S. Söll D. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 2455-2461Google Scholar, 30Weygand-Durašević I. Ban N. Jahn D. Söll D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 869-877Google Scholar), the comparison of the substrate binding and catalytic constants for the wild-type and mutant yeast SerRS was performed with proteins isolated from E. coli. Since the aminoacylation assay did not reveal significant changes in the affinity for tRNA (Table II), but instead showed impaired ATP and serine binding capacities resulting in elevated K m values for both substrates accompanied by decreased turnover rates, the impact of the mutations on the steady-state kinetic parameters were independently determined in the amino acid activation reaction. Mutants SerRS2 (R279C/E281Q/G283A/D288V/W290L) and SerRS3 (R279P/A282R) have no detectable in vitro enzyme activity and could not be used for kinetic studies. This is in agreement with the inability of SES1 mut2 and SES1 mut3 to substitute for the wild-type SES1 function in vivo. In both mutants Arg279, which aligns with an invariant arginine in the class II synthetases, was replaced with other amino acids. This change probably causes the major inactivating effect in SerRS2 and SerRS3, since this position corresponds to Arg256 in T. thermophilus SerRS, which is in direct contact with the phosphate of the seryl-adenylate. Superposition of the models of the wild-type and SerRS2 motif 2 loops, with the seryl-adenylate analog positioned as in the crystal structure of T. thermophilus SerRS (10Belrhali H. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Larsen K. Berthet-Colominas C. Leberman R. Beijer B. Sproat B. Als-Nielsen J. Grübel G. Legrand J.-F. Lehmann M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1432-1436Google Scholar), is shown in Fig. 2. In order to determine the contribution of particular amino acid alterations, to enzyme function, the five mutations found in SerRS2 were separated. This was achieved by reconstruction of pSKSES1 mut2, carrying the unique NcoI site introduced in SES1 as silent mutations at the position of the Gly260 and Ser261 codons. The PstI-NcoI and NcoI-EagI fragments of pSKSES1 mut2 were individually replaced with corresponding fragments excised from pSKSES1 wt. The new constructs, named SES1 mut6 and SES1 mut7, recloned as BamHI cassettes behind the T7 promoter of pET3, were used for the overproduction of SerRS6 (R279C/E281Q/G283A) and SerRS7 (D288V/W290L), respectively. As expected, the mutation of three absolutely conserved residues in motif 2 (see below), render the mutant SerRS6 totally inactive in both the amino acid activation and aminoacylation reactions. The kinetic analysis of SerRS7 showed slightly reduced specificity constants for both ATP and serine, relative to the wild-type enzyme. The affinity for tRNA of this mutant was slightly increased. This is of considerable interest, since the occurrence of tryptophan at position 290 is unique to yeast SerRS, and thus could be expected to be involved in tRNA binding. All other seryl-tRNA synthetases contain an arginine or lysine at this position. The exception is SerRS from A. thaliana, which contains a leucine. This indicates that the replacement of one bulky and hydrophobic amino acid (Trp) for another (Leu) is tolerated.Table IIKinetic parameters for wild-type and mutant SerRS enzymes (aminoacylation and PPi exchange reaction at 30°C)EnzymeAminoacylationPPi exchangekcatKmRelative kcat/KmkcatKmRelative kcat/Kms−1Ms−1MSerSerRS0.976.3 × 10−513.84.5 × 10−41SerRS40.034.2 × 10−40.0050.0856.0 × 10−40.017SerRS50.037.0 × 10−40.0030.0558.9 × 10−40.007SerRS70.552.0 × 10−40.182.18.0 × 10−40.32SerRS80.0852.1 × 10−40.0260.0914.5 × 10−40.024SerRS90.0362.3 × 10−40.0100.0524.6 × 10−40.014SerRS100.451.7 × 10−40.172.04.7 × 10−40.52ATPSerRS0.992.5 × 10−513.54.0 × 10−61SerRS40.0515.5 × 10−40.0230.0744.8 × 10−50.002SerRS50.0313.0 × 10−40.0260.0414.0 × 10−50.001SerRS70.511.3 × 10−40.101.63.7 × 10−50.050SerRS80.0953.5 × 10−40.0070.0793.4 × 10−50.003SerRS90.0434.5 × 10−40.0020.042.5 × 10−50.018SerRS100.426.0 × 10−50.181.971.0 × 10−50.23tRNASerSerRS1.11.9 × 10−71SerRS50.0573.5 × 10−70.028SerRS70.651.0 × 10−71.12 Open table in a new tab Kinetic analysis of the aminoacylation and amino acid activation reactions revealed that substitution of the class II invariant glycine in SerRS4 (G291V) and SerRS5 (E281D/G291A) has the most dramatic effect on ATP and serine binding. The enzymes exhibit more than an order of magnitude elevated K m for ATP and 35-fold decrease in kcat. The parameters for serine were changed to a similar extent, while the K m for the tRNA (for mutant SerRS5) is almost identical to the wild-type value. Gly291 of yeast SerRS occupies a position that is strictly conserved in the primary structures of all prokaryotic and eukaryotic seryl-tRNA synthetases. Its analogue is not exposed in the active site of the T. thermophilus enzyme, thus it is probably involved in maintaining an overall motif 2 loop conformation (10Belrhali H. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Larsen K. Berthet-Colominas C. Leberman R. Beijer B. Sproat B. Als-Nielsen J. Grübel G. Legrand J.-F. Lehmann M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1432-1436Google Scholar). As recently discussed by Cusack et al. (13Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Google Scholar), the occurrence of several glycines in the loop, surrounded by other small residues, may provide the necessary flexibility and reduced steric hindrance to facilitate the conformational switch imposed by tRNA binding. In agreement with this structural data, alteration of the nonpolar Ala282 in yeast SerRS (mutant SerRS10) to serine, another small but polar amino acid, causes the least dramatic change in kinetic parameters. To single out the effect of the E281D replacement, two mutations in SES1 mut5 were separated by the same experimental procedure as described above for SES1 mut2. Two new mutant enzymes were obtained by expression of the reconstructed SES1 mut8 and SES1 mut9 genes: SerRS8 (E281D) and SerRS9 (G291A), respectively. Glu281 in yeast SerRS is of special interest since it aligns with Glu258 in T. thermophilus SerRS, which is a part of the Arg256-X-Glu peptide. The side chain conformation of this residue is fixed upon binding of ATP or adenylate, which is believed to be the first step toward the stabilization of the motif 2 loop, which is also involved in tRNA acceptor stem interactions (10Belrhali H. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Larsen K. Berthet-Colominas C. Leberman R. Beijer B. Sproat B. Als-Nielsen J. Grübel G. Legrand J.-F. Lehmann M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1432-1436Google Scholar, 13Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Google Scholar). Glu258 is severely reoriented upon tRNA binding, making direct contact with the discriminator base. In yeast SerRS, Glu281 is also apparently involved in ATP binding, since its replacement with Asp, which only differs in side chain length results in a severe elevation of K m for ATP (from 18- to 8-fold) accompanied by an approximately 8-10-fold decreased turnover rate, in the aminoacylation and PPi exchange reactions, respectively (Table II). Furthermore, while PPi exchange does not reveal a change of the K m value of SerRS8 with respect to serine, aminoacylation shows a 3.6-fold elevation of K m compared to wild-type. The substitution Gly291→ Ala in SerRS9 has a similar impact on the steady-state kinetic parameters. Crystallographic and biochemical data have shown that the specific recognition of cognate tRNASer by prokaryotic SerRS depends on the mutual interaction of two structural elements that are unique to the serine system: the α-helical coiled-coil (helical arm) in the enzyme, with the long variable arm of the tRNA (12Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Google Scholar, 13Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Google Scholar). The importance of the variable arm as the crucial identity element for tRNASer recognition has been demonstrated in both prokaryotic (44Himeno H. Hasegawa T. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Shimizu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6815-6819Google Scholar, 45Normanly J. Ollick T. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5680-5684Google Scholar, 46Asahara H. Himeno H. Tamura K. Nameki N. Hasegawa T. Shimizu M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 738-748Google Scholar) and eukaryotic (47Wu X.Q. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5589-5594Google Scholar) systems. Since the N-terminal polypeptide of yeast SerRS, comprising 107 amino acids, can be modeled into a coiled-coil that resembles the corresponding structural element of T. thermophilus SerRS (Fig. 2), it seems likely that similar interactions govern tRNASer recognition in yeast. According to the recent experiments of Cusack et al. (13Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Google Scholar), the acceptor stem of tRNASer interacts with the motif 2 loop of the active site, causing a conformational switch in this protein domain. Although the correct positioning of the 3′ end of tRNA in the active site of yeast SerRS may be disturbed by the alteration of amino acid residues in the putative loop, the kinetic parameters for tRNA do not change dramatically. Despite their critical role in aminoacylation, motif 2 loop residues generally contribute only weakly to the total tRNA-enzyme binding energy, as revealed by the small changes in K d for tRNA of the inactive yeast aspartyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes mutated in this region (14Cavarelli J. Eriani G. Rees B. Ruff M. Boeglin M. Mitschler A. Martin F. Gangloff J. Thierry J.-C. Moras D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 327-337Google Scholar). Possible effects of mutations in the active site on the rate of amino acid transfer, which is commonly rate-limiting for aminoacylation (see below), were reflected in our experiments by reduced catalytic efficiencies for both ATP and serine (Table II), as would be expected for substitution of residues involved in the catalysis of aminoacyl-adenylate formation. The K m values for wild-type yeast SerRS, with respect to both ATP and serine, are considerably different when determined by the PPi exchange or aminoacylation reactions. The affinity for serine is more than an order of magnitude higher in the reaction performed in the presence of tRNA rather than in the activation step. Furthermore, the apparent affinity of SerRS for serine, as measured during seryl-adenylate formation, is not significantly changed by amino acid replacements. In contrast, an order of magnitude difference in K m values for wild-type and mutant SerRS, with respect to serine, was observed during aminoacylation. These results are consistent with the possibility that new binding sites for serine are created upon tRNA binding. When the kinetic data presented here are considered in conjunction with structural data for T. thermophilus SerRS, it is clear that SerRS displays tRNA-dependent amino acid recognition, as described previously for E. coli glutaminyl- and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases (48Ibba M. Hong K.-W. Sherman J.M. Sever S. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6953-6958Google Scholar). In agreement with the T. thermophilus SerRS structural studies, the apparent affinity for ATP to the yeast enzyme decreases 6.3-fold in the aminoacylation reaction compared to PPi exchange. This may support the idea that conformational changes in the active site are induced by substrate binding, as recently observed for eukaryotic aspartyl- (14Cavarelli J. Eriani G. Rees B. Ruff M. Boeglin M. Mitschler A. Martin F. Gangloff J. Thierry J.-C. Moras D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 327-337Google Scholar) and prokaryotic seryl-tRNA synthetases (13Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Google Scholar). Mutational changes in the 278-294 region of yeast SerRS may interfere with the proposed structural flexibility essential to the function of the motif 2 loop. It is also likely that the impaired interaction of mutant SerRS enzymes with ATP and serine makes the amino acid activation reaction, instead of the transfer reaction, rate-limiting. This conclusion is based on the comparison of the k cat values for wild-type and mutant enzymes in PPi exchange and aminoacylation. In contrast to wild-type SerRS, which more rapidly turns over ATP and serine in the absence of tRNA, the catalytic rate constants characterizing the most affected mutant proteins (SerRS4 and SerRS5) are comparable in the activation and aminoacylation reactions. In summary, the results of in vivo and in vitro functional analyses of yeast SerRS mutants, combined with structural data for theT. thermophilus and E. coli enzymes which allowed the prediction of yeast SerRS structure, strongly suggest that seryl-tRNA synthetase from S. cerevisiae structurally and functionally resembles its prokaryotic counterparts in the active site. We are indebted to Nenad Ban, Michael Ibba, and Sanja Sever for critical discussions."

The level of a high affinity form of the FGFR-1 is dramatically elevated as a result of α-exon skipping during RNA splicing. In this paper we have been able to duplicate this tumor-specific RNA processing pathway by transfection of a chimeric minigene containing a 4-kilobase fragment of the human FGFR-1 gene (including the α-exon) into a variety of cell lines. In a transfected human astrocytoma cell line, α-exon skipping was consistently observed for RNA transcripts derived from both the chimeric minigene and endogenous gene expression. This exon skipping phenotype was dependent on the size of the flanking intron as deletions which reduced the introns to less than ∼350 base pairs resulted in enhanced α-exon inclusion. Increased exon inclusion was not sequence-specific as exon skipping could be restored with insertion of nonspecific sequence. Cell-specific exon recognition was maintained with a 375-nucleotide sequence inclusive and flanking the α-exon, provided that intron size was maintained. These results identify the minimal cis-regulatory sequence requirements for exclusion of FGFR-1 α-exon in astrocytomas.

The His-B10 residues in this hexamer form tris imidazole chelates in which pseudotetrahedral Co(II) centers are completed by an exogenous fourth ligand. This study investigates how the MCD signatures of the Co(II) center in this unit are influenced by the chemical and steric characteristics of the fourth ligand. The spectra obtained for the adducts formed with halides, pseudohalides, trichloroacetate, nitrate, imidazole, and 1-methylimidazole appear to be representative of near tetrahedral Co(II) geometries. With bulkier aromatic ligands, more structured spectra indicative of highly distorted Co(II) geometries are obtained. The MCD spectrum of the phenolate adduct is very similar to those of Co(II)-carbonic anhydrase (alkaline form) and Co(II)-β-lactamase. The MCD spectrum of the Co(II)-R6-CN− adduct is very similar to the CN− adduct of Co(II)-carbonic anhydrase. The close similarity of the Co(II)-R6-pentafluorophenolate and Co(II)-R6-phenolate spectra demonstrates that the Co(II)-carbonic anhydrase-like spectral profile is preserved despite a substantial perturbation in the electron withdrawing nature of the coordinated phenolate oxygen atom.

The phylogenetic tree is composed of three domains: Eucarya (eukaryotes), Bacteria (eubacteria), and Archaea (archaebacteria) (1Woese C.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 1-9Google Scholar). Archaebacteria comprises several different families of cells adapted to extreme environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, pH, salt concentration). Although eubacteria and archaebacteria are both prokaryotes, it is now generally accepted that archaebacteria are not closer, phylogenetically, either to eubacteria or to eukaryotes (2Rowlands T. Baumann P. Jackson S.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1326-1329Google Scholar). Therefore, archaebacteria appear to constitute an intermediary domain between eubacteria and eukaryotes. Ion channels have been mostly studied in eukaryotic cells (3Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar) and have also been documented in eubacteria. In particular bacterial porins and mechanosensitive ion channels are well described. Porins, large water-filled pores across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (reviewed in 4Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3905-3908Google Scholar), have also been found in the cell wall of certain Gram-positive bacteria such as mycobacteria (5Trias J. Jarlier V. Benz R.

More recently, different mechanosensitive ion channels have been described in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (8Martinac B. Buechner M. Delcour A.H. Adler J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These channels, most likely localized in the plasma membrane, are implicated in osmoregulation (13Berrier C. Coulombe C. Szabo′ I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Google Scholar). In contrast, the presence of ion channels in archaebacteria has not been documented. A search for ion channels in Archaea thus seems to be of interest not only for the understanding of the phylogeny of ion channels, but also for a better knowledge of the physiology of these unique organisms. For our studies we chose Haloferax volcanii (formerly Halobacterium volcanii), a moderate halophilic archaeon amenable to genetic studies. We report here the existence of ion channels in the cell envelope of H. volcanii, that with regard to electrophysiological characteristics resemble bacterial porins. This finding indicates the importance of the porin family in the phylogeny of ion channels. Furthermore, it questions our current knowledge of the organization of the cell envelope of archaebacteria. H. volcanii (strain NCMB 2012) cells were grown in a medium containing (in mM) NaCl (3350), MgCl2 (170), MgSO4 (200), CaCl2 (6Trias J. Benz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6234-6240Google Scholar), KCl (26Kessel M. Widhaber I. Cohen S. Baumeister W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1549-1554Google Scholar), NaHCO3 (6.6), NaBr (5.4) plus 5 g of yeast extract/liter. In some cases the medium was supplemented with MnCl2 (2.9), ZnSO4 (1.6), Cu SO4 (0.2), FeSO4 (1.5) plus 5 g of tryptone/liter. One liter of cells was grown up to an A600 of 1 and harvested by centrifugation and the pellet resuspended in 10 ml of H20. Addition of EDTA (50 mM final concentration) resulted in lysis of most of the cells. To ensure total lysis, the suspension, supplemented with DNase (20 μg/ml) and MgCl2 (5 mM), was passed through a French press (8000 p.s.i.). The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g to eliminate cell debris. The supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 45,000 rpm, using a Ti45 Beckman rotor. The pellet was then resuspended in 10 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, plus 5% ethylene glycol. Protein content was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (18Lowry D.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). 50-μl aliquots (at 2-5 mg of protein/ml) were stored at −80°C for further use. Cell envelopes were mixed with azolectin (from soybean, type II-S, Sigma) liposomes at a lipid to protein ratio (w/w) of 50 and fused into giant proteoliposomes by dehydration-rehydration as described previously (11Berrier C. Coulombe A. Houssin C. Ghazi A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 27-32Google Scholar). Rehydration was performed in 100 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4. Membrane proteins from cell envelopes were solubilized using octyl β-D-glucoside; 100 μl of the cell envelope suspension was mixed with 900 μl of the solubilization buffer (10 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 300 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM octyl β-D-glucoside) and incubated for 20 min. The suspension was then centrifuged at 90,000 rpm for 40 min using a TL100 Beckman ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was added to a 1-ml suspension of asolectin liposomes (1 mg of lipids/ml) in 10 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 300 mM KCl and incubated for 20 min before the addition of Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) (160 mg/ml). The suspension was gently agitated for 5 h, the Bio-Beads were discarded, and the suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 90,000 rpm, using a TL100 Beckman ultracentrifuge. The pellet was then resuspended in 200 μl of 300 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4. Giant proteoliposomes were examined for channel activity using the standard patch-clamp method (19Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Google Scholar). 2 μl of the giant proteoliposomes suspension was added to the patch-clamp chamber and covered with 2 ml of 100 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4. Patch electrodes were pulled from pyrex capillaries (Corning code 7740) and were not fire-polished. They were filled with 10 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2. After gigaohm-seal formation on a giant liposome, the patch was excised, and unitary currents were recorded using a Biologic (Claix, France) RK-300 patch-clamp amplifier with a 10-gigaohm feedback resistance. The membrane potential refers to the potential in the bath minus the potential in the pipette. Planar lipid bilayers were formed across a 250-μm diameter hole by presenting a bubble of asolectin lipids dissolved in n-decane (30 mg/ml) in front of the hole. After membrane formation, the mechanical and electrical stability of the membrane was monitored for 10 min before addition of crude cell envelopes or proteoliposomes to the cis compartment (8 μg protein/ml final concentration in both cases). Fusion to the planar bilayer was induced by imposing a salt gradient between the two chambers (500 mM KCl in the cis compartment versus 100 mM KCl in the trans compartment). The trans compartment was held at virtual ground potential and the membrane current amplified using a homemade device. All solutions were filtered using 0.22-μm Millipore filter. Electrical recordings from patch-clamp or planar bilayer experiments were stored on a digital audio tape (Biologic DTR 1200 DAT recorder). Records were subsequently filtered at 1 kHz (−3 db point) through a 4-pole Bessel low-pass filter and digitized off-line at 2 kHz on a personal computer. Data were plotted by a Hewlett-Packard Laserjet printer. Several attempts were made to record channel activities from native membranes of giant protoplasts of H. volcanii. Despite a concentrated effort to make the surface of the giant protoplasts amenable to patch-clamp recording, we were unable to form gigaohm-seal on their surface. Therefore, we decided to record ion channel activities by either reconstituting H. volcanii cell envelope in artificial liposomes or into planar bilayers. The archaeal membrane vesicles were fused into giant liposomes by dehydration and rehydration (10Delcour A.H. Martinac B. Adler J. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 631-636Google Scholar, 11Berrier C. Coulombe A. Houssin C. Ghazi A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 27-32Google Scholar), and the giant liposomes were then examined by the patch-clamp technique. In parallel experiments the membrane vesicles were fused into planar lipid bilayers. In addition, cell envelope membrane proteins were solubilized using octyl β-D-glucoside, reconstituted in liposomes that were then fused into planar lipid bilayers. Independently of the technique used the predominant channel activity encountered exhibited the characteristics described below. Channels were mostly open at all voltages in the range −120 mV to +120 mV and exhibited frequent fast transitions to closed levels of different amplitudes (data not shown). At voltages greater than 120 mV the channels tended to close in a manner characterized by large, slow (seconds) transitions (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The greater the magnitude of the membrane potential, the shorter the open-time duration following the voltage step. Sporadic fast closures were often superimposed on the slow kinetic closures. For some patches the channels also entered a sustained fast gating mode (millisecond) as shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 2Closure of H. volcanii ion channels at negative bilayer potentials. The bilayer and recording solution were the same as in Fig. 1. Applied voltages are as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The tendency to close at high membrane potentials was greater at one polarity (positive potential for bilayer experiments and negative potential for patch-clamp experiments), indicating both a preferential insertion of the channels in the lipid bilayer and an asymmetry in the voltage dependence. Fig. 1, Fig. 2 show recordings from the same bilayer at positive and negative voltages. Upon application of +180 mV across the bilayer the channels reached a closed inactivated state (Fig. 1). At negative potential, full closure of the channels could not be reached, and the time course of closure was much slower (Fig. 2). In most cases the inactivated state was reversible and the channels reopened by returning to 0 mV for several seconds (Fig. 1). However, in a few instances, the channels appeared to be locked in the inactivated state, and reopening could not be obtained at any membrane potential. In general the channel gating was complex, showing a range of conductances in between 10 and 300 picosiemens in symmetric 100 mM KCl. While this could be attributed in part to a mixture of different channels (see below), in some cases clear cooperative events were observed, indicating that the channels can gate at different conductance states. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, which shows recordings obtained by two successive steps to −160 mV on the same patch. The most frequent transition had a conductance of 80 picosiemens, but a clear cooperative 160-picosiemens transition was also observed. Furthermore, channel gating at a subconductance level of approximately 10 picosiemens was observed. The selectivity of the channels was examined in bilayer experiments performed in asymmetric (500/100 mM KCl) and symmetric solution (500 mM KCl). I-V curves for unitary currents were difficult to obtain because of the different conductances encountered at each membrane potential. Instead, we chose to plot the total initial current through a given bilayer obtained during steps to various values of the membrane potential. Between steps the membrane potential was returned to 0 mV to ensure proper reopening of the channels. The current thus corresponded to that flowing through all the fully open channels present in a bilayer. In a series of nine different bilayer experiments, the following reversal potentials (in millivolts) were obtained: +24, +20, +20, +12, −4, −8, −14, −18, −23. The two extreme cases are shown in Fig. 4. These results suggest that at least two different types of porin-like channels with opposite selectivity are present in H. volcanii envelopes. We report here for the first time the existence of ion channels found in the cell envelope of an archaebacterium. The electrophysiological characteristics of these channels, documented by two different techniques, can be summarized as follows: 1) the channels that have large conductances are maximally open at or around 0 mV and close at positive and negative voltages, 2) voltage dependence is asymmetric, 3) the channels exhibit both fast and slow kinetics, and 4) the channels exhibit several subconducting states. The same electrophysiological characteristics can be found in eubacterial porins as documented for OmpF and OmpC (20Berrier C. Coulombe A. Houssin C. Ghazi A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 251-256Google Scholar) and PhoE from Escherichia coli 1Berrier, C., Besnard, M., and Ghazi, A. (1997) J. Membr. Biol., in press. and also in mitochondrial porins (reviewed in 21Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Google Scholar). This suggests that all these channels may belong to the same family of functionally and/or structurally related membrane pores. The observation that these types of channels are found in all domains of the tree of life indicates the importance of the porin family in the phylogeny of ion channels. What is the localization of these channels? Due to their characteristics, their presence in the cytoplasmic membrane is unlikely. Although the channels would normally be closed at the high negative membrane potential characteristic of microbial cells, any depolarization would result in the sustained opening of these high conductance channels, probably leading to cell death. Therefore it is likely that these porin-like channels are located in the cell envelope outside the plasma membrane, as in eubacteria. In eubacteria, porins are located in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria where they allow the diffusion of small hydrophylic compounds through this protection barrier (4Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3905-3908Google Scholar). Gram-positive bacteria were long supposed to lack porin channels. However, porin-like channels have been recently identified in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria such as Mycobacterium chelonae (5Trias J. Jarlier V. Benz R. Science. 1992; 258: 1479-1481Google Scholar, 6Trias J. Benz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6234-6240Google Scholar), Mycobacterium smegmatis (7Trias J. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 283-290Google Scholar), and Corynebacterium glutamicum (22Niederweiss M. Maier E. Lichtinger T. Benz R. Krämer R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5716-5718Google Scholar). These bacteria are known to contain lipids in their cell wall in the form of mycolic acids, and it is possible that mycolic acids and other lipids form part of another bilayer (23Nikaido H. Kim S.H. Rosenberg E.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1025-1030Google Scholar), explaining the low permeability of the mycobacterial cell wall (24Jarlier V. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1418-1423Google Scholar). Diffusion through this bilayer would be facilitated by porins. Only one membrane, the plasma membrane, is documented in archaea such as Halobacterium halobium or H. volcanii. The main component of the cell wall is the S-layer formed by a hexagonal arrangement of a glycoprotein (25Lechner J. Wieland F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 173-194Google Scholar). A detailed structural study of the S-layer of H. volcanii (26Kessel M. Widhaber I. Cohen S. Baumeister W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1549-1554Google Scholar) together with a a previous x-ray study of the envelope of H. halobium (27Blaurock A. Stoeckenius W. Oesterhelt D. Scherphof G. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 1-22Google Scholar) led to a model in which the upper external part of the glycoprotein forms a dome-shaped region separated from the cell membrane by spacer elements (26Kessel M.

The protein is thought to be anchored in the plasma membrane by a hydrophobic stretch that is observed near the C terminus of both the H. halobium and H. volcanii glycoprotein sequence (28Sumper M. Berg E. Mengele R. Strobel I. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7111-7118Google Scholar, 29Lechner J. Sumper M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9724-9729Google Scholar). The interspace between the plasma membrane and the external part of the S-layer has been considered as an aqueous space analogous to the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria (26Kessel M. Widhaber I. Cohen S. Baumeister W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1549-1554Google Scholar, 27Blaurock A. Stoeckenius W. Oesterhelt D. Scherphof G. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 1-22Google Scholar). However, if porins are present in the cell wall, but do not belong to the plasma membrane, they should be located in this interspace, which should then contain a lipid membrane. This membrane should represent in itself a permeability barrier through which movement of solutes would be facilitated by porins. Therefore, the discovery of porins in H. volcanii would suggest a more complex organization for the cell envelope of archaea than previously believed, possibly more similar to that of some Gram-positive eubacteria such as Mycobacteria (30Brennan P.J.

The clathrin heavy chain (CHC) is the major structural protein of coated vesicles, the principal organelles of receptor-mediated endocytosis. To understand the role of clathrin in the development of the oocyte's powerful endocytotic machinery we determined the structure of the mosquito chc gene. The gene spans approximately 45 kilobases and its coding region is divided into seven exons, five of which encode the protein. Three distinct mature transcripts of this gene were identified in mosquito tissues. Two of them code isoforms of the CHC polypeptide differing in their NH2-terminal sequences, and are specifically expressed in female germ-line cells. The third transcript has a 3′-untranslated region about 1 kilobase longer than the other variants, and is found only in the somatic cells. Tissue-specific 5′-exon splicing and alternative polyadenylation of the primary transcript combine to give rise to these mRNAs. We identified two alternative promoters, distal and proximal, separated by approximately 10 kilobases involved in tissue-specific regulation of mosquito chc gene expression. Our data provide the first molecular evidence for complex structure and regulation of a chc gene, in this case occurring at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.

Insect oocytes are highly specialized for receptor-mediated endocytosis of yolk protein precursors, and are characterized by a concentration of endocytotic organelles that is unparalleled in any other cell. The principal organelles of this endocytotic machinery are clathrin-coated pits and clathrin-coated vesicles.

During endocytosis, certain receptors for extracellular ligands are selectively concentrated in clathrin-coated pits. With the aid of the GTPase dynamin (7Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Google Scholar), a fully-invaginated coated pit is pinched off into the cytoplasm as a coated vesicle that contains the receptors and their ligands. In the cytoplasm, the clathrin coat disassembles rapidly and the uncoated vesicle fuses with its specific target compartment.

Clathrin is ubiquitously expressed by eukaryotic cells of all organisms analyzed so far, from Protozoa to Metazoa (8Pley U. Parham P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 431-464Google Scholar). Although unicellular organisms such as yeast (9Payne G.S. Schekman R. Science. 1985; 230: 1009-1014Google Scholar, 10Lemmon S.K. Jones E.W. Science. 1987; 238: 504-509Google Scholar) and Dictyostelium (11O'Halloran T.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1371-1377Google Scholar) can grow slowly and survive in the absence of clathrin, even the relatively simple cellular differentiation of these organisms require its function. Recent genetic studies in Drosophila have demonstrated that in multicellular organisms clathrin function is essential, and moreover, that there is a specialized role for clathrin in certain cell differentiation processes, like spermatogenesis (12Bazinet C. Katzen A.L. Morgan M. Mahowald A.P. Lemmon S.K. Genetics. 1993; 134: 1119-1134Google Scholar). Although coated vesicles were first identified in insect cells, viz. mosquito oocytes (13Roth T.F. Porter K.R. J. Cell Biol. 1964; 20: 313-332Google Scholar), detailed biochemical characterizations of clathrin (14Pearse B.M.F.

Sequence analyses have demonstrated a relatively high degree of identity (about 50%) among CHC polypeptides from such disparate species as rat and yeast, but only about 18% identity among CLCs. Mammals (rat, cattle, and human) express two types of CLC, which are coded by distinct single copy genes (16Kirchhausen T. Scarmato P. Harrison S.C. Monroe J.J. Chow E.P. Mattaliano R.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5097-5103Google Scholar). In contrast, only one single-copy gene for CHC has been identified in mammals (15Kirchhausen T. Harrison S.C. Chow E.P. Mattaliano R.J.

Genetics. 1993; 134: 1119-1134Google Scholar), and no splicing events of CHC mRNA have been described for any of these species. However, very recently, a second gene for CHC with differential expression in human sceletal muscle was identified (27Sirotkin H. Morrow B. DasGupta R. Goldberg R. Patanjali S. Shi G. Cannizzaro L. Shprintzen R. Weissman S. Kucherlapati R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 617-624Google Scholar, 28Kedra D. Peyrard M. Fransson I. Collins J. Dunham I. Roe B. Dumanski J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 625-631Google Scholar), suggesting that the molecular heterogeneity of clathrin triskelions in at least some tissues could arise from a combination of CLC and CHC variants. The intensive process of receptor-mediated endocytosis of yolk protein precursors in the developing oocytes of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, provides an excellent model system for analyzing the biogenesis of clathrin-associated transport machinery (29Raikhel A.S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 35: 279-283Google Scholar). Systematic characterization of the major components of this machinery at the molecular level is not only of general biological interest but also of practical significance, because the processes of egg maturation and disease transmission are intimately tied in anautogenous mosquitoes through the requirement of a blood meal. Recently, one of the major components of this vesicular transport system, the mosquito vitellogenin receptor, was characterized (30Dhadialla T.S. Hays A.R. Raikhel A.S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 22: 803-816Google Scholar, 31Sappington T.W. Hays A.R. Raikhel A.S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 807-817Google Scholar) and its cDNA isolated and sequenced (32Sappington T.W. Kokoza V.A. Cho W.-L. Raikhel A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8934-8939Google Scholar). This paper reports the molecular characterization of the gene coding another major component of coated vesicles, the CHC. Our results demonstrate that the A. aegypti chc gene is regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Combinations of alternative 5′-exon splicing and alternative polyadenylation generate three distinct mature CHC transcripts, which exhibit tissue-, stage-, and sex-specific expression. Our data also suggest that two alternative promoter regions are involved in A. aegypti chc gene regulation resulting in two CHC isoforms in ovarian germ-line cells. In addition, whole mount in situ hybridization experiments with mosquito ovaries have revealed that the A. aegypti chc gene is expressed very early during previtellogenic development of the oocyte and that the ovarian CHC transcripts are found only in germ-line cells. Mosquitoes, A. aegypti, were maintained in laboratory culture as described elsewhere (33Hays A.R. Raikhel A.S. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1990; 199: 114-121Google Scholar). Vitellogenesis was initiated 3-5 days after eclosion with a blood meal on rats. A cDNA fragment of the A. aegypti CHC was first amplified from 20 μg of ovarian total RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using a degenerate forward primer, TCGT-CTAGATG(CT)AA(CT)GA(AG)CC(A,C,G,T)GC(A,C,G,T)GT(A,C,G,T)TGG, and a reverse primer, ATTCTAGTC(A,C,G,T)GT(A,G)AACAT(A,C,G,T)CCCAT(A,G)TG, which were designed based on CHC sequences conserved in Drosophila and rat (12Bazinet C. Katzen A.L. Morgan M. Mahowald A.P. Lemmon S.K. Genetics. 1993; 134: 1119-1134Google Scholar, 15Kirchhausen T. Harrison S.C. Chow E.P. Mattaliano R.J. Ramachandran K.L. Smart J. Brosius J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8805-8809Google Scholar). To facilitate cloning of PCR products, an anchor sequence (italics) containing an XbaI restriction site (underlined) was added to the 5′-end of the primers. A 650-bp cDNA fragment was generated and subcloned into the pUC119 vector, and its identity verified by double-strand sequencing (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Seven independent cDNA clones and four partially overlapping genomic DNA clones, comprising the entire coding region of the A. aegypti chc gene, were subsequently isolated by hybridization screening of a λZAP II cDNA library generated from previtellogenic female mosquitoes, and of a λFix II genomic library prepared from adult mosquito whole bodies (35Deitsch K.W. Raikhel A.S. Insect Mol. Biol. 1993; 2: 205-213Google Scholar). In addition, two cDNA clones, representing the 5′-most end of CHC transcripts, were generated by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique (36Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Google Scholar). For this, 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from vitellogenic ovaries 6 h post-blood meal (PBM) was reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers. The RNA/DNA hybrid was digested with RNase H, and the single stranded cDNA was tailed at the 3′-end with dGTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. First strand cDNA was then amplified using a 5′-anchor primer (5′-AGAGAATTCCCCCCCCCCCCCC-3′) and a gene-specific reverse primer RP3 (5′-TGCGCATCGTTCATATCGATAATG-3′) designed from the genomic sequence of clone λCHC N1. Two different PCR-generated fragments of 0.34 and 0.68 kb were obtained, subcloned, and sequenced. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the putative A. aegypti CHC clones were analyzed using the FASTA and GAP programs (University of Wisconsin, Genetics Computer Group software). Primer extension experiments were performed following the method described by Sambrook et al. (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A 30-base oligonucleotide (5′-TTTTGACGTTTTGCTCTCATGAATGTCGAC-3′) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and used in primer extension reactions with 10 μg of total ovarian RNA isolated from previtellogenic females and 10 μg of tRNA (as a control). The products were fractionated on a DNA sequencing gel. Bacteriophage M13mp18 DNA was sequenced as a marker using M13 primer from a Sequenase version 2.0 kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). S1 nuclease mapping was performed with a 522-bp genomic SacI-SalGI fragment derived from phage clone λCHC4D. The 5′-end of the SalGI site of this fragment was dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) and 32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. After hydridization of the probe with 10 μg of total ovarian RNA and 10 μg of tRNA (as a control), and subsequent digestion with S1 nuclease as described by Sambrook et al. (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), the reaction products were processed in the same manner as in primer extension analyses. Total RNA was extracted and purified from mosquito tissues by the guanidine isothyocyanate method as described previously (37Bose S.G. Raikhel A.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 436-442Google Scholar). BioMag Oligo(dT)20 beads (PerSeptive Diagnostics, Inc.) were used for poly(A)+ RNA isolation from total ovarian RNA according to the supplier's instructions. For Northern blot analyses, total RNA was fractionated in 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels, blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized to 32P-labeled DNA probes under high stringency conditions (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RT-PCR analyses were used to determine developmental expression profiles of two CHC isoforms in mosquito ovaries, as well as their tissue and sex specificity. For each time point tested, 10 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers. The PCR reaction was performed under conditions previously described (38Cho W.-L. Raikhel A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21823-21829Google Scholar) using isoform-specific forward primers, FP1a (5′-AGCATGGCATCGCTTCTG AAGCTGACC-3′) and FP2b (5′-CATGTCGCAGGCTCTCCCGATTC GTTTCC-3′), and a common reverse primer RP3, the same as for the 5′RACE-PCR reaction. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized to probes specific to the individual transcript being analyzed. Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed according to the method of Tautz and Pfeifle (39Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1989; 98: 81-85Google Scholar) as described previously (32Sappington T.W. Kokoza V.A. Cho W.-L. Raikhel A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8934-8939Google Scholar, 40Suter B. Steward R. Cell. 1991; 67: 917-926Google Scholar). To characterize the mosquito CHC, putative cDNA and genomic clones were isolated and analyzed. Using degenerate primers based on Drosophila and rat sequences (12Bazinet C. Katzen A.L. Morgan M. Mahowald A.P. Lemmon S.K. Genetics. 1993; 134: 1119-1134Google Scholar, 15Kirchhausen T. Harrison S.C. Chow E.P. Mattaliano R.J. Ramachandran K.L. Smart J. Brosius J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8805-8809Google Scholar), a 650-bp fragment of CHC cDNA was amplified from ovarian total RNA by RT-PCR, and subsequently subcloned and sequenced. The amino acid sequence deduced from this cDNA fragment exhibits identities of 85% to Drosophila, 75% to rat, 55% to Dictyostelium, and 46% to yeast CHCs, confirming that the isolated clone was from a mosquito CHC. Using this DNA fragment as a probe, several independent clones were isolated from a cDNA library of previtellogenic females, characterized by restriction analysis, and partially sequenced. Sequencing of both strands of the largest cDNA (3.9 kb) revealed that this clone contained a 2.5-kb protein-coding region and a 1.4-kb 3′-untranslated region (UTR). All isolated clones showed extensive congruence of DNA sequences in the protein coding region, but they fell into two classes differing in their 3′-UTR: one group exhibited a long 3′-UTR of 1.4 kb, whereas the other had a short 3′-UTR of 0.35 kb. Northern analyses revealed two types CHC transcripts in mosquito tissues (Fig. 1A): an “ovarian” 6.5-kb mRNA found only in the ovaries of previtellogenic and vitellogenic females, and a “somatic” 7.5-kb mRNA present in the somatic tissues of females (females minus ovaries, or carcasses) and whole body preparations of males. Significantly, when the unique portion of the long 3′-UTR (1-kb fragment) was used as a probe, hybridization was observed to the somatic mRNA only (Fig. 1B), indicating that the major difference between the two mRNAs was the length of the 3′-UTR. Because the largest cDNA clone contained only the 3′-half of the CHC protein-coding region, a fragment from its 5′-end was used to screen cDNA libraries (constructed from previtellogenic females and vitellogenic ovaries) and a genomic library in an attempt to isolate the full CHC coding sequence. A 14-kb clone containing the beginning of the coding region of the CHC was isolated from the genomic library. This genomic clone, λCHC1N, was characterized by restriction mapping, hybridization to cDNAs, and extensive sequence analysis (Fig. 2). Based on comparisons with other clathrin sequences, we estimated that it contained 99% of the CHC protein-coding region, including four exons (3, 4, 5, and 6; Fig. 2); the last of these also coded the first 148 bp of the 3′-UTR. However, sequences coding for the 5′-UTR, the very beginning of the translated region (∼14 aa), and the majority of the 3′-UTR were unrepresented in this clone. It was not known how distant the remaining short protein-coding region at the 5′-end was from the beginning of exon 3, and sequencing over 1 kb into the intron failed to reveal it. The strategy we adopted was to determine the sequence of this region from 5′-RACE PCR-generated cDNA, which would allow us to design probes from its sequence to isolate genomic clones containing it. Suprisingly, sequencing of the RACE-PCR products revealed two classes of cDNA (0.34- and 0.68-kb) coding CHC isoforms, A. aegypti CHCa and A. aegypti CHCb, differing in their 5′-UTRs and NH2-terminal portions of the protein (Fig. 3). Probes designed from both isoform-specific sequences were used to screen the genomic library, and two positive phage clones, λCHC4B and λCHC4D, were isolated (Fig. 2). Restriction mapping and sequencing of restriction fragments hybridizing to probes from A. aegypti CHCa and A. aegypti CHCb demonstrated that the two clones overlap and that the two isoforms are coded by alternatively spliced exons: A. aegypti CHCa is produced by splicing exon 1a to exon 3, and A. aegypti CHCb is generated by splicing exons 1b, 2b, and 3 (Fig. 2; Table I). Exon 1a is 182 bp long, is located ∼15 kb upstream of exon 3, and codes the 5′-UTR and the beginning of the NH2-terminal sequence of A. ageytpi CHCa. Exons 1b and 2b are separated by a small intron of 53 bp and are located ∼5 kb upstream of exon 3. Exon 1b codes part of the 5′-UTR and exon 2b codes the remainder of the 5′-UTR and the NH2-terminal sequence of A. aegypti CHCb.Table ISizes of exons and introns and splice junction sequences of the mosquito A. ageypti chc geneExonExon/intron junction sequencesIntronNo.Size5′-Donor site3′-Acceptor siteNo.Sizebpkb1a182ATC CAGgtattt………….ttcaacagCTC ACC1a>15Ile Gln Leu Tre1b692TCTTGAgttaaa………….cgtttcagCTCGTA1b0.0532b259TTG CAGgtaaat………….ttcaacagCTC ACC2b>5Leu Gln Leu Tre3208AAA Ggtatct……………tcccgcagCT CAA30.069Lys A la Gln4256GTT Ggtaagt…………….atttttagGT ATT40.7Val G ly Ile54041AAA Ggtatgt………………tctactagGA AAC50.2Lys G ly Asn6620ACTGgtgagt……………..ctttacagATCATT6>157(o)201 (Ovarian)7(s)1274 (Somatic) Open table in a new tab To isolate a clone containing the 3′-end of the gene, the unique 1-kb fragment of the long 3′-UTR cDNA was used as a probe. This screening successfully yielded the remainder of the 3′-UTR: the isolated genomic clone, λCHC5-1, coded the last exon (exon 7; Fig. 2). Because the clones λCHC5-1 and λCHC1N did not overlap, the size of the intron separating exons 6 and 7 was gauged by Southern blot analysis of mosquito genomic DNA. The minimum size of this intron was estimated to be ∼15 kb (data not shown). The structure of exon 7 was determined by sequencing a 7.1-kb genomic EcoRI-EcoRI fragment derived from λCHC5-1 (Fig. 2). This genomic sequence was compared to the cDNA sequences of the long 1.4-kb and short 0.35-kb 3′-UTRs (Fig. 4). The genomic sequence from phage λCHC5-1 was identical to the long cDNA sequences, and no splice variants were observed in this region. The sequence of the 3′-UTR of the A. aaegypti chc gene (Fig. 4) is coded by the last 148 nucleotides of exon 6 and exon 7, about 1.3-kb. Several putative consensus sites, ATTTA, which are thought to increase instability of mRNA (41Malter J.S. Science. 1989; 246: 664-666Google Scholar, 42Stoecklin G. Hahn S. Moroni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28591-28597Google Scholar), are located in this region. Two of these sites were identified in the nucleotide sequence of the ovarian transcript (short 3′-UTR), and seven sites were found in the somatic transcript sequence (long 3′-UTR) (Fig. 4). A nonamer consensus sequence, TTATTTA(T/A)(T/A), containing repeat number 5 of the somatic transcript sequence and the tandemly arranged repeats numbers 6 and 7 are two motifs recently shown to significantly increase mRNA instability in many cases (43Chen C -Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar). Analysis of exon-intron organization of the A. aegypti chc gene (Table I) revealed that all splice sites conform to the GT/AG consensus (44Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Konarska M.M. Seiler S. Sharp P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Google Scholar): the introns start with a GT-dinucleotide and end with an AG-dinucleotide. Examination of intron phasing indicates that introns 1a, 1b, and 2 are positioned between codons, while all other introns which interrupt the protein-coding region (3, 4, and 5) are situated between the first and second nucleotide within the codon. Primer extension and S1 nuclease protection experiments were conducted to determine the transcription start site of the ovarian mRNA-coded isoform, A. aegypti CHCb. A 30-base oligonucleotide primer, complementary to the sequence of putative exon 1b (position 91-121 of the A. aegypti CHCb cDNA generated by 5′-RACE PCR) (GenBank accession number GSDB:S:1076487), was hybridized to total previtellogenic ovarian RNA and extended using Superscript II reverse transcriptase. This resulted in a 552-bp extension product (Fig. 5A), placing the transcription start site 432 bp upstream of the available cDNA. We performed S1 nuclease protection experiments to confirm that this position is the genuine start site of chc gene transcription, and that the extension product was not prematurely terminated due to mRNA secondary structure. When a 522-nucleotide DNA probe, corresponding to a genomic fragment containing most of putative exon 1b and extending upstream, was hybridized to total ovarian RNA, one strong S1-resistant product of 502 bp was detected (Fig. 5B). Thus, the size of exon 1b was calculated to be 692 bp, and the inferred start site position corresponds well with that predicted from the primer extension experiments. Tissue specificity of alternative 5′-end exon splicing, and the possible correspondence of the A. aegypti CHCa and A. aegypti CHCb isoforms to the ovarian (6.5-kb) and somatic (7.5-kb) transcripts were examined by RT-PCR of RNA fractions from ovaries of previtellogenic and vitellogenic females, female carcasses, males, and early embryos. Three PCR primers were used: the reverse primer RP3 (containing a sequence from exon 3 common to both the A. aegypti CHCa and A. aegypti CHCb isoforms), and two forward primers, FP1a (specific to the A. aegypti CHCa isoform, derived from the exon 1a sequence) and FP2b (specific to the A. aegypti CHCb isoform, derived from the exon 2b sequence). PCR amplification using exon 1a- and 3-specific primers produced an intense band of the expected size (203 bp) from ovaries of previtellogenic females (1 and 4 days after eclosion) and early vitellogenic females (6 h PBM), and a less intense band from ovaries of later vitellogenic females (18 h PBM) (Fig. 6). No bands were observed using RNA from ovaries of late vitellogenic females (24 and 48 h PBM), female carcasses, males, or early embryos (Fig. 6). In contrast, PCR amplification using primers specific to exons 2b and 3 yielded intense bands of the expected size (177 bp) for the ovaries of previtellogenic and vitellogenic females, as well as for female carcasses, males, and early embryos (Fig. 6). We examined the spatial distribution of the AaCHC transcripts in the ovary by whole mount in situ hybridization. The hybridization signal was observed in the oocytes of developing primary follicles during early previtellogenic stages and later in their nurse cells (Fig. 7). There was no apparent accumulation in the somatic follicle cells. Interestingly, A. aegypti CHC RNA could be detected even in oocytes of the undifferentiated ovary, 0-1 day after eclosion (Fig. 7A). It dramatically increased in abundance by 3-4 days after eclosion (Fig. 7B). During the vitellogenic period, A. aegypti CHC mRNA was present in both oocytes and nurse cells from 3 to 12 h PBM (Fig. 7C) but virtually disappeared from the primary follicles by 24 h PBM. It is noteworthy that, at midvitellogenesis, the accumulation of A. aegypti CHC transcripts could also be clearly detected in the oocytes of secondary follicles (not shown). Significantly, no hybridization was observed to a probe derived from the long 3′-UTR, which specifically recognizes the 7.5-kb somatic transcript (not shown), suggesting that only the 6.5-kb ovarian transcript is synthesized in germ-line derived cells during pre- and vitellogenic stages. Finally, control (sense) DNA probes never produced hybridization signals (not shown), confirming the specificity of the in situ hybridization technique used in this study. The A. aegypti chc gene spans ∼45 kb and is composed of 7 exons, five of which encode the protein (Fig. 2). The protein-coding sequence of the A. aegypti chc gene is highly conserved evolutionarily, at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Although the protein-coding sequences of CHCs are well characterized in several organisms, until now no detailed molecular characterization of a chc gene has been reported. Hybridization analyses demonstrated that the Drosophila CHC transcription unit is not less than 10-kb; and P element-mediated transformation has shown that a 13-kb genomic DNA fragment, including the transcription unit, is sufficient to rescue lethal CHC mutations (12Bazinet C. Katzen A.L. Morgan M. Mahowald A.P. Lemmon S.K. Genetics. 1993; 134: 1119-1134Google Scholar). Thus, the length of the Drosophila CHC locus should be approximately three times less than that of the mosquito, consistent with the 5-fold larger size of the A. aegypti genome (45Rao P.N. Rai K.S. Heredity. 1987; 59: 253-258Google Scholar). Two CHC isoforms, A. aegypti CHCa and A. aegypti CHCb, were identified when 5′-RACE PCR products were sequenced (Fig. 3), and analyses of overlapping genomic clones revealed that these isoforms are coded by distinct transcripts generated as a result of alternative splicing of exons at the 5′-end of the gene (Fig. 2). The transcription start site was identified for the A. aegypti CHCb mRNA (Fig. 5), but has not yet been determined for the A. aegypti CHCa transcript. Preliminary experiments suggest that there may be another exon upstream of exon 1a containing an untranslated sequence that has yet to be isolated. Nevertheless, it is clear that transcription of the two A. aegypti CHC mRNA variants is regulated by two alternative promoters, which we designate distal (for A. aegypti CHCa) and proximal (for A. aegypti CHCb). Employment of isoform-specific primers in RT-PCR showed that A. aegypti CHCa transcripts are present in ovarian tissue only, but that A. aegypti CHCb transcripts can also be detected in somatic tissues of females and males (Fig. 6). These results strongly suggest that there is tissue- and sex-specific usage of exon 1a, but not of exons 1b and 2b. Differential stage-specific expression is characteristic of the splice variants as well. Both the A. aegypti CHCa transcript, regulated by a distal promoter, and the A. aegypti CHCb transcript, regulated by a proximal promoter, exhibit similar kinetics, peaking in the late previtellogenic and early vitellogenic stage (Fig. 6). However, the distal ovarian transcript (A. aegypti CHCa) is expressed only before 24 h PBM (peak of vitellogenesis), and is not detectable later. In contrast, the proximal ovarian transcript (A. aegypti CHCb) is present throughout the entire vitellogenic period, persisting until the later stages of egg development and even in newly-laid eggs (Fig. 6). We suggest that the distal ovarian transcript is required for the receptor-mediated machinery of developing oocytes; it is uniquely germ-line specific and is expressed prior to or during yolk protein endocytosis, disappearing at the time of uptake termination. The proximal ovarian transcript with its persistent presence in fully-developed eggs indicates that this mRNA may be produced to meet the future needs of the mosquito embryo. In addition to the two types of transcripts generated through alternative splicing, two tissue-specific size classes of A. aegypti CHC transcripts (6.5-kb ovarian and 7.5-kb somatic) were detected by Northern hybridization experiments (Fig. 1). Sequencing of cDNA clones revealed that the ∼1-kb difference in size is accounted for by a corresponding difference in the lengths of the 3′-UTRs. Comparison of the genomic sequence of this region with those of the cDNA clones (Fig. 4) indicated that the size variants do not arise through alternative splicing of exons in the 3′-region. Instead, alternative polyadenylation is the probable mechanism generating the observed size variants of A. aegypti CHC mRNAs (Fig. 1). Two putative alternative polyadenylation signals were identified at positions 5357 and 6426 (Fig. 4). It is thus likely that alternative usage of these polyadenylation signals results in expression of two different transcripts in somatic and female reproductive tissues. The deduced alternative splicing and transcription termination events occurring in the transcripts derived from the A. aegypti chc gene are presented in Fig. 8. The dual mechanisms of alternative splicing in the 5′-region and alternative polyadenylation in the 3′-region combine to produce at least three types of mature CHC transcripts in mosquito tissues, which we designate A. aegypti CHCa-O (ovarian), A. aegypti CHCb-O (ovarian), and A. aegypti CHCb-S (somatic) (Fig. 8). Thus, the A. aegypti chc gene is apparently regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in a tissue-, sex-, and stage-specific manner. In contrast to A. aegypti CHCa-O and A. aegypti CHCb-O, the A. aegypti CHCb-S transcript is found only in female somatic tissues (Fig. 1). Both A. aegypti CHCb-O and A. aegypti CHCb-S are regulated by the proximal promoter (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8), but alternative polyadenylation results in unique sequences in the 3′-UTR. Eukaryotic gene expression is partly controlled by rate of mRNA degradation, which is generally a function of regulatory sequences in the 3′-UTR (46Decker C.J. Parker R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 336-340Google Scholar). The longer 3′-UTR of the A. aegypti CHCb-S transcript contains more and more potent consensus sequences (42Stoecklin G. Hahn S. Moroni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28591-28597Google Scholar, 43Chen C -Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar) that promote mRNA decay than does the shorter 3′-UTR of the A. aegypti CHCa-O and AaCHCb-O transcripts (Fig. 4). These data suggest that the ovarian A. aegypti CHC transcripts are more stable than the somatic one. Such stability would facilitate accumulation of A. aegypti CHC mRNA in developing oocytes, permitting large-scale production of clathrin protein during vitellogenesis when endocytosis of massive amounts of vitellogenin is occurring. Ovarian AaCHC transcripts with short 3′-UTR begin to accumulate very early in oocyte differentiation (Fig. 7A) and resistance to decay would be of obvious advantage. Clathrin is widely distributed in both germ-line and somatic cells of eukaryotes, playing an extremely important role in the universally critical processes of receptor-mediated endocytosis and secretion. It is likely that clathrin exhibits specialized functions in various tissues, implying a need for specific regulation of chc gene expression during the development of multicellular organisms. Genetic studies in yeast and Drosophila demonstrated that different functions of clathrin are genetically distinguishable (12Bazinet C. Katzen A.L. Morgan M. Mahowald A.P. Lemmon S.K. Genetics. 1993; 134: 1119-1134Google Scholar, 19Lemmon S.K. Pellicena-Palle A. Conley K. Freund C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 65-80Google Scholar). Yeast CHC with a carboxyl-terminal deletion can rescue viability defects of null mutations but fails to complement defects in a-factor processing (19Lemmon S.K. Pellicena-Palle A. Conley K. Freund C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 65-80Google Scholar). Three of four lethal mutations of the CHC locus in Drosophila block development late in embryogenesis probably affecting the neuromotor function (12Bazinet C. Katzen A.L. Morgan M. Mahowald A.P. Lemmon S.K. Genetics. 1993; 134: 1119-1134Google Scholar). Individuals with the fourth allele occasionally survive to adulthood but are characterized by invariable male sterility, pointing to a specialized role for clathrin in spermatogenesis. The results presented in this paper provide the direct molecular evidence for complex regulation of a chc gene in higher organisms. Two promoter regions have been identified in the A. aegypti chc gene. Alternative usage of these promoters clearly has tissue-, sex-, and stage-specific characteristics. One would expect that mutations associated with these sequences will effect different functions and lead to various phenotypes. In addition, alternative polyadenylation has been observed at the 3′-end of the A. aegypti CHC primary transcript, which may differentially effect the stability, and perhaps translation efficiency, of A. aegypti CHC mRNA in germ-line and somatic cells. The combination of all these complex genetic processes provides a putative basis from which a diversity of CHC transcripts is derived, a diversity which may be essential for specialized functions of clathrin in eukaryotic cells.

To begin studying how TFIIA mediates these effects, we used a highly sensitive protease footprinting methodology to identify surfaces of human TFIIA participating in TFIIA·TBP·TATA ternary complex formation. Chymotrypsin and proteinase K cleavage patterns of TFIIA bearing a 32P-end-labeled γ subunit revealed that amino acids 59-73 were protected from cleavage both in the context of an immobilized ternary complex and in a binary complex with TBP alone. In contrast, amino acids 341-367 in the β portion of a 32P-labeled α-β subunit were protected in the ternary but not in the binary complex, implying that those residues interact with promoter DNA. The regions of human TFIIA identified by protease footprinting are homologous to and encompass the yeast TFIIA residues that contact TBP and DNA in the recently solved crystal structure of the yeast ternary complex. The conservation of the regions and residues mediating complex formation implies that yeast and human TFIIA employ the same mechanism to stabilize the binding of TFIID to a core promoter.

Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Google Scholar, 2Zawel L. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 533-561Google Scholar, 3Hori R. Carey M. Curr. Opin.

Understanding how these interactions mediate formation of a transcription complex over a core promoter is a central problem in the field of gene expression. In the step-wise model, transcription complex assembly is nucleated by binding of the general initiation factors (Transcription Factor) TFIID and TFIIA to the TATA box generating the “DA complex” (5Zawel L. Reinberg D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 67-108Google Scholar). The parallel between the ability of gene activators to facilitate DA complex formation and to activate transcription suggests that the complex plays a key role in regulation (6Chi T. Lieberman P. Ellwood K. Carey M. Nature. 1995; 377: 254-257Google Scholar).TFIID is a multisubunit complex consisting of TATA box binding protein (TBP) and eight or more TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (7Dynlacht B.D. Hoey T. Tjian R. Cell. 1991; 66: 563-576Google Scholar, 8Zhou Q. Lieberman P.M. Boyer T.G. Berk A.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1964-1974Google Scholar, 9Poon D. Bai Y. Campbell A.M. Bjorklund S. Kim Y.J. Zhou S. Kornberg R.D. Weil P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8224-8228Google Scholar, 10Reese J.C. Apone L. Walker S.S. Griffin L.A. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 523-527Google Scholar). TBP alone, when it is substituted for TFIID, can nucleate the formation of a basal transcription complex that is fully functional but not responsive to activators. In contrast, TAFs are thought to act as co-activators because they are dispensable for basal transcription but are required to obtain activator-responsive transcription in vitro. In addition to TAFs, a fraction called upstream-factor stimulatory activity (USA), which contains both positive and negative co-regulators, potentiates transcriptional activation (11Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu H.M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 66: 981-993Google Scholar).In the DA complex, TFIIA functions both to stabilize the relatively weak binding between TFIID and the TATA box and is necessary for activator recruitment of TFIID (12Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 995-1006Google Scholar, 13Kobayashi N. Boyer T.G. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6465-6473Google Scholar, 14Shykind B.M. Kim J. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1354-1365Google Scholar); its role in recruitment depends on the TAFs since activators have no effect on TBP·TFIIA complex formation. In the stepwise model, the formation of the transcription complex is completed by the successive association of TFIIB, RNA polymerase/TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH (2Zawel L. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 533-561Google Scholar, 4Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 161-190Google Scholar). An alternative model for complex formation involves a holoenzyme (15Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 113-116Google Scholar) containing RNA polymerase II and many of the other general initiation factors. The holoenzyme was discovered initially in yeast and more recently in mammalian cells. Both the yeast and some mammalian versions have been reported to lack TFIID and TFIIA (16Chao D.M. Gadbois E.L. Murray P.J. Anderson S.F. Sonu M.S. Parvin J.D. Young R.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 82-85Google Scholar, 17Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Google Scholar, 18Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Google Scholar). One possible function of the DA subcomplex is to form an activator-responsive platform for recruitment of the holoenzyme.Human (and Drosophila) TFIIA is a multisubunit protein consisting of three subunits called α (LN), β (LC), and γ (S) (19Ma D.

Biol. 1992; 12: 413-421Google Scholar). α and β are synthesized as a precursor that is processed proteolytically to generate the mature subunits although the unprocessed form is functional in vitro. Yeast TFIIA consists of only two subunits, TOA1 and TOA2 (26Ranish J.A. Lane W.S. Hahn S. Science. 1992; 255: 1127-1129Google Scholar, 27Ranish J.A. Hahn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19320-19327Google Scholar). TOA1 is homologous at its amino and carboxyl termini to regions of the human α and β subunits, respectively, and TOA2 is homologous to the human γ subunit (19Ma D. Watanabe H. Mermelstein F. Admon A. Oguri K. Sun X. Wada T. Imai T. Shiroya T. Reinberg D. Handa H. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2246-2257Google Scholar, 20Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H. Lee A. Rosen C.A. Lieberman P.M.

Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2220-2234Google Scholar). Analysis of systematic internal deletion mutants of both subunits demonstrated that all of the regions conserved between yeast and human TFIIA were required for yeast viability (28Kang J.J. Auble D.T. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1234-1243Google Scholar). For TOA1 (α and β), these deletion mutants defined the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends as essential but the nonconserved, middle region as dispensable for viability. A deletion mutant removing residues 217-240 abolishes binding to TBP. For TOA2 (γ), all of the internal deletions but one resulted in inviable yeast, making it difficult to genetically define functional domains. Alanine scanning mutants of both subunits were screened for temperature-sensitive (ts) growth phenotypes. In TOA1, all the ts mutations were in basic residues between residues 253 and 259. These mutants bound normally to TBP but could not form complexes, implying a decreased ability to bind DNA. Among the three ts mutants identified in TOA2, one double mutant, D73A/D74A, bound less tightly to TBP although complex formation was unaffected, and the other two exhibited no detectable difference in their ability to bind TBP or form ternary complexes. Human TFIIAγ has also been analyzed by alanine substitution mutations and Y65A (equals Y69 in yeast TOA2) caused the greatest decrease in the ability of IIA to stabilize TBP binding (29Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Google Scholar).The crystal structure of the ternary complex containing the yeast (y)CYC1 TATA box, yTBP, and yTFIIA was recently published (30Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Google Scholar, 31Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, yTBP, which encodes two 80-amino acid direct repeats, folds into a pseudosymmetric saddle-like shape containing a hydrophobic concave surface composed of a 10-strand antiparallel β-sheet, which interacts with the minor groove of the DNA. TBP binding distorts the TATA box by inserting phenylalanine residues between the first and final base pairs of the recognition site, resulting in bending of the DNA by 80° and broadening of the minor groove (32Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 512-520Google Scholar, 33Kim J.L. Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 365: 520-527Google Scholar). yTFIIA, on the other hand, is composed of a four-helix bundle and a 12-strand β-barrel (30Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Google Scholar, 31Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Google Scholar). The β-barrel is made of six strands each from the carboxyl terminus of TOA1 (TOA1C∼human TFIIAβ) and the carboxyl terminus of TOA2 (γ). The four-helix bundle is composed of the amino terminus of TOA1 (TOA1N∼human TFIIAα) and the amino terminus of TOA2. The interaction between TFIIA and TBP places the β-sheets of TOA2 and TBP in close proximity, resulting in a continuous 16-strand β-sheet. TFIIA interacts with DNA through basic residues in TOA1C that lie within a loop connecting two β-strands.DNA-protein cross-linking studies have confirmed certain aspects of the structure in solution (34Coulombe B. Li J. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19962-19967Google Scholar, 35Legrange T. Kim T.K. Orphanides G. Ebright Y. Ebright R. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10620-10625Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies show cross-linking was observed between DNA and α upstream of the TATA box, between β and both sides of the TATA box, and with γ at one position upstream of the TATA. In the crystal structure of the yeast complex, only a region homologous to part of the β subunit contacts DNA.To study how TFIIA stabilizes TFIID/TBP binding, we investigated the assembly of the ternary complex containing a mammalian TATA box, human TBP, and human TFIIA. Presently, there is no genetic analysis of the α-β subunit of human TFIIA or crystal structure of free TFIIA. To identify the interactions mediating complex formation, the differences between free TFIIA and complexed TFIIA were characterized using protease footprinting. The interactions of TFIIA with TBP and DNA were identified along with the accessible regions of TFIIA. The results of our protease footprinting studies are placed within the context of the recently solved x-ray structure of the yeast ternary complex.DISCUSSIONWe have identified, using protease footprinting, interactions made by human TFIIA upon assembly of the TFIIA-TBP-TATA box ternary complex. Each subunit makes a series of contacts with one of the other components of the complex, the TFIIAγ subunit with TBP and the IIAα-β subunit with DNA. These two interactions allow TFIIA to form a bracket that stabilizes TBP binding. These results are summarized schematically in Fig. 4. Together, TBP and TFIIA function to provide specificity and stability. The preference of TBP for the TATA box provides the specificity required to bring TFIID to the promoter, but the weak affinity of TFIIA for DNA is used advantageously to stabilize binding of TFIID to promoters, which contain diverse sequences flanking the TATA box.Correlations with Crystal Structure and Biochemical DataThe contacts made by TFIIA within the human ternary complex as measured by protease footprinting are similar to those made within the yeast ternary complex as identified in the crystal structure. Fig. 5A is a ribbon diagram illustrating the recently solved crystal structure of the yeast ternary complex (30Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Google Scholar, 31Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Google Scholar) in which yTOA1 (α and β), yTOA2 (γ), TBP, and the TATA box oligonucleotide are yellow, green, blue, and white, respectively. In the structure, the two subunits of yTFIIA are highly intertwined and form a boot-shaped structure in which TOA2 (γ) interacts with TBP and TOA1 (α and β) interacts with DNA. TFIIA binds to the underside of TBP along the loop (stirrup) (42Nikolov D.B. Hu S.H. Lin J. Gasch A. Hoffmann A. Horikoshi M. Chua N.H. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1992; 360: 40-46Google Scholar) connecting β-strand 2 and β-strand 3. A mutagenesis study, in which radical changes were introduced into surface residues of human TBP, identified an interaction between TFIIA and residues encompassing the stirrup within the first direct repeat of TBP, consistent with the crystal structure (43Bryant G.O. Martel L.S. Burley S.K. Berk A.J. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 2491-2504Google Scholar). The ability of these TBP mutants to support transcriptional activation in vivo and TBP-TFIIA complex formation in vitro was greatly diminished.Fig. 5Summary of results modeled on the crystal structure. A-D, ribbon model of the yTFIIA-yTBP-TATA box ternary complex. Yeast TFIIA (homologous to TFIIAα-β), yTOA2 (homologous to TFIIAγ), yTBP, and DNA containing a TATA box are yellow, green, light blue, and white, respectively. The view in panel A is from the same angle used in panels B and C. The view in panel D is the same one used in panels E and F. B, space-filling model of yTFIIA. Yeast TFIIA (homologous to TFIIAα-β) and yTOA2 (homologous to TFIIAγ) are yellow and green, respectively. The residues of hTFIIA (i.e. the homologous ones in yTOA2) identified by protease footprinting as interacting with TBP are identified as red. C, space-filling model of the ternary complex. yTFIIA is shown from the same view as in panel B and using the same color scheme. yTBP and DNA containing a TATA box are light blue and white, respectively. The interaction between the red residues of the γ subunit and TBP can be easily visualized. E, space-filling model of yTFIIA. The color scheme is the same as in panel B except that the residues of hTFIIA (i.e. the homologous ones in yTOA1) identified by protease footprinting as interacting with DNA are identified as red. F, space-filling model of the ternary complex. yTFIIA is shown from the same view as in panel E and using the same color scheme. yTBP and DNA containing a TATA box are light blue and white, respectively. The interaction between the red residues of the α-β subunit and DNA can be easily visualized.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In Figs. 5B, C, E, and F, our footprinting results are superimposed on space-filling models of yeast TFIIA (Fig. 5, B and E) alone and in the ternary complex (Fig. 5, C and F). Fig. 5, B and C, shows the γ-TBP interaction using the same view as in Fig. 5A. Fig. 5B illustrates yTFIIA alone in which TOA1 (i.e. hTFIIAα-β) is yellow and TOA2 (i.e. hTFIIAγ) is green. The residues identified by protease footprinting as interacting with TBP (hTFIIAγ residues 59-73 homologous to yTOA2 residues 63-77) are colored red. Of the 15 residues in the protected region, 11 of the positions are homologous between human and yeast including all those that directly contact TBP.In Fig. 5C, TBP (blue) and the TATA box oligonucleotide (white) have been added to TFIIA. The protected region in red forms β-strands that are part of the domain that is intertwined with the β-strands of yTOA1 to form the β-barrel. A comparison of Fig. 5B with 5C illustrates that the edge of the concave β-sheet region of TBP covers the “red” region and explains why TBP protects that region from proteolysis.Fig. 5, D-F, is a separate view of the ternary complex used to optimize presentation of the region of hTFIIAα-β protected in the ternary complex. Fig. 5, E and F, superimposes the interaction between TFIIAα-β and DNA identified by protease footprinting onto TFIIA alone (Fig. 5E) and in the ternary complex (Fig. 5F). In this case, the residues protected in hTFIIAα-β (TOA2) are labeled as red, and this region lies within the β-strands of the β-portion of hTFIIAα-β. Within the identified region, 16 of the 27 residues are homologous between yeast and human, including 6 basic ones.The region of the human TFIIAα-β subunit protected from proteolysis in the ternary complex includes the homologous residues of yeast TOA1 shown to contact DNA directly. In Fig. 5F, when yTBP (blue) and the TATA box oligonucleotide (white) are added to yTFIIA (shown from the same view and with the same color scheme in Fig. 5E), the DNA runs across the “red” residues, which is consistent with the observed protease footprint. It appears from the figure that the protected residue at the bottom of the figure may still be accessible from underneath. However, the TATA box oligonucleotide used for our footprinting experiments is longer than the one used in the crystallography studies, which would increase the protection of that site.The one interaction observed in the crystal structure that was not detected in our study was the insertion of the penultimate tryptophan residue of yTOA1 into a crevice created where TBP and yTOA2 interact. Because that tryptophan is the carboxyl-terminal residue in hTFIIAα-β, it is probably too close to our HMK tag for detection.Although the protease footprinting analysis does not identify other interactions of hTFIIA within the ternary complex, it is possible that a protease-resistant region forms other contacts. The lack of a proteolytic reagent that cleaves at every surface position does tend to limit the protease footprinting approach. One possible limitation is revealed by mutational studies that indicate that an interaction exists between a highly acidic region of hTFIIA α-β and the H2 helix of TBP (44Buratowski S. Zhou H. Science. 1992; 255: 1130-1132Google Scholar, 45Lee D.K. DeJong J. Hashimoto S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5189-5196Google Scholar, 46Tang H. Sun X. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1119-1124Google Scholar). We have not identified such a region in our study.Interactions of TFIIA with TBP in the absence of DNA have been studied using “GST-pulldown” experiments. Interactions of the α, β, and γ subunits (or their homologues) individually with TBP have been identified. However, in view of the crystal structure, the previous studies will have to be reevaluated because the subunits are intertwined and probably will not fold properly on their own. Our studies define an interaction between only the γ subunit and TBP.A protein-DNA cross-linking study concluded the α subunit interacts with promoter DNA upstream of TBP centered at −45, the γ subunit is close to only −39, and the β subunit can be cross-linked to both sides of TBP (35Legrange T. Kim T.K. Orphanides G. Ebright Y. Ebright R. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10620-10625Google Scholar). These data are similar to an earlier study (34Coulombe B. Li J. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19962-19967Google Scholar). We detect only an interaction between the β portion of the α-β subunit and DNA. The absence of an α-DNA interaction may simply reflect the use of a TATA box oligonucleotide that is too short to detect this interaction. It may also be possible that some proportion of TFIIA undergoes a conformational change within the ternary complex leading to these other DNA contacts, a finding supported by at least one recent study (21Sun X. Ma D. Sheldon M. Yeung K. Reinberg D. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2336-2348Google Scholar).Based on protease sensitivity, it is plausible that other proteins will interact with TFIIA via the carboxyl terminus of the γ subunit and with the α subunit. Because the γ subunit binds TBP, regulatory proteins interacting with the γ subunit could modulate the ability of TFIIA to associate with TBP. There is evidence that the Epstein-Barr virus activator ZEBRA overcomes a mutation in the γ subunit, which decreases TBP binding and complex formation (29Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Google Scholar). Because the α subunit is upstream within the ternary complex (30Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Google Scholar, 31Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Google Scholar), α is positioned to more easily interact with activators or possibly TAFs that extend toward upstream bound activators.Our understanding of how the transcription complex is assembled requires an understanding of each step, particularly the key regulatory ones. We have characterized the formation of a promoter-bound complex containing TBP and TFIIA. We will use this study as a starting point to perform parallel studies with TFIID and to examine the interactions of activators. It will be particularly interesting to determine how (and if) TAFs change the interaction of IIA with TBP. The ability of activators to both facilitate complex assembly and induce a conformational change in the DA complex could be studied. These future studies will benefit from using smaller proteolytic reagents, especially given the larger size of TFIID relative to TBP. Recent experiments by the labs of Meares, Heyduk, and Ebright and coworkers (47Greiner D.P. Hughes K.A. Gunasekera A.H. Meares C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 71-75Google Scholar, 48Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9643-9650Google Scholar, 49Heyduk T. Heyduk E. Severinov K. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10162-10166Google Scholar) have shown that hydroxyl-radicals can be an effective reagent for protease footprinting studies and will probably be a useful reagent for our studies.

Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Google Scholar, 2Zawel L. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 533-561Google Scholar, 3Hori R. Carey M. Curr. Opin.

Understanding how these interactions mediate formation of a transcription complex over a core promoter is a central problem in the field of gene expression. In the step-wise model, transcription complex assembly is nucleated by binding of the general initiation factors (Transcription Factor) TFIID and TFIIA to the TATA box generating the “DA complex” (5Zawel L. Reinberg D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 67-108Google Scholar). The parallel between the ability of gene activators to facilitate DA complex formation and to activate transcription suggests that the complex plays a key role in regulation (6Chi T. Lieberman P. Ellwood K. Carey M. Nature. 1995; 377: 254-257Google Scholar).TFIID is a multisubunit complex consisting of TATA box binding protein (TBP) and eight or more TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (7Dynlacht B.D. Hoey T. Tjian R. Cell. 1991; 66: 563-576Google Scholar, 8Zhou Q. Lieberman P.M. Boyer T.G. Berk A.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1964-1974Google Scholar, 9Poon D. Bai Y. Campbell A.M. Bjorklund S. Kim Y.J. Zhou S. Kornberg R.D. Weil P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8224-8228Google Scholar, 10Reese J.C. Apone L. Walker S.S. Griffin L.A. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 523-527Google Scholar). TBP alone, when it is substituted for TFIID, can nucleate the formation of a basal transcription complex that is fully functional but not responsive to activators. In contrast, TAFs are thought to act as co-activators because they are dispensable for basal transcription but are required to obtain activator-responsive transcription in vitro. In addition to TAFs, a fraction called upstream-factor stimulatory activity (USA), which contains both positive and negative co-regulators, potentiates transcriptional activation (11Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu H.M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 66: 981-993Google Scholar).In the DA complex, TFIIA functions both to stabilize the relatively weak binding between TFIID and the TATA box and is necessary for activator recruitment of TFIID (12Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 995-1006Google Scholar, 13Kobayashi N. Boyer T.G. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6465-6473Google Scholar, 14Shykind B.M. Kim J. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1354-1365Google Scholar); its role in recruitment depends on the TAFs since activators have no effect on TBP·TFIIA complex formation. In the stepwise model, the formation of the transcription complex is completed by the successive association of TFIIB, RNA polymerase/TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH (2Zawel L. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 533-561Google Scholar, 4Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 161-190Google Scholar). An alternative model for complex formation involves a holoenzyme (15Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 113-116Google Scholar) containing RNA polymerase II and many of the other general initiation factors. The holoenzyme was discovered initially in yeast and more recently in mammalian cells. Both the yeast and some mammalian versions have been reported to lack TFIID and TFIIA (16Chao D.M. Gadbois E.L. Murray P.J. Anderson S.F. Sonu M.S. Parvin J.D. Young R.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 82-85Google Scholar, 17Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Google Scholar, 18Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Google Scholar). One possible function of the DA subcomplex is to form an activator-responsive platform for recruitment of the holoenzyme.Human (and Drosophila) TFIIA is a multisubunit protein consisting of three subunits called α (LN), β (LC), and γ (S) (19Ma D.

Goodrich J.A. Chen J.L. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2235-2245Google Scholar, 25Cortes P. Flores O. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 413-421Google Scholar). α and β are synthesized as a precursor that is processed proteolytically to generate the mature subunits although the unprocessed form is functional in vitro. Yeast TFIIA consists of only two subunits, TOA1 and TOA2 (26Ranish J.A. Lane W.S. Hahn S. Science. 1992; 255: 1127-1129Google Scholar, 27Ranish J.A. Hahn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19320-19327Google Scholar). TOA1 is homologous at its amino and carboxyl termini to regions of the human α and β subunits, respectively, and TOA2 is homologous to the human γ subunit (19Ma D. Watanabe H. Mermelstein F. Admon A. Oguri K. Sun X. Wada T. Imai T. Shiroya T. Reinberg D. Handa H. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2246-2257Google Scholar, 20Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H. Lee A. Rosen C.A. Lieberman P.M.

Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2220-2234Google Scholar). Analysis of systematic internal deletion mutants of both subunits demonstrated that all of the regions conserved between yeast and human TFIIA were required for yeast viability (28Kang J.J. Auble D.T. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1234-1243Google Scholar). For TOA1 (α and β), these deletion mutants defined the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends as essential but the nonconserved, middle region as dispensable for viability. A deletion mutant removing residues 217-240 abolishes binding to TBP. For TOA2 (γ), all of the internal deletions but one resulted in inviable yeast, making it difficult to genetically define functional domains. Alanine scanning mutants of both subunits were screened for temperature-sensitive (ts) growth phenotypes. In TOA1, all the ts mutations were in basic residues between residues 253 and 259. These mutants bound normally to TBP but could not form complexes, implying a decreased ability to bind DNA. Among the three ts mutants identified in TOA2, one double mutant, D73A/D74A, bound less tightly to TBP although complex formation was unaffected, and the other two exhibited no detectable difference in their ability to bind TBP or form ternary complexes. Human TFIIAγ has also been analyzed by alanine substitution mutations and Y65A (equals Y69 in yeast TOA2) caused the greatest decrease in the ability of IIA to stabilize TBP binding (29Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Google Scholar).The crystal structure of the ternary complex containing the yeast (y)CYC1 TATA box, yTBP, and yTFIIA was recently published (30Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Google Scholar, 31Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, yTBP, which encodes two 80-amino acid direct repeats, folds into a pseudosymmetric saddle-like shape containing a hydrophobic concave surface composed of a 10-strand antiparallel β-sheet, which interacts with the minor groove of the DNA. TBP binding distorts the TATA box by inserting phenylalanine residues between the first and final base pairs of the recognition site, resulting in bending of the DNA by 80° and broadening of the minor groove (32Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 512-520Google Scholar, 33Kim J.L. Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 365: 520-527Google Scholar). yTFIIA, on the other hand, is composed of a four-helix bundle and a 12-strand β-barrel (30Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Google Scholar, 31Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Google Scholar). The β-barrel is made of six strands each from the carboxyl terminus of TOA1 (TOA1C∼human TFIIAβ) and the carboxyl terminus of TOA2 (γ). The four-helix bundle is composed of the amino terminus of TOA1 (TOA1N∼human TFIIAα) and the amino terminus of TOA2. The interaction between TFIIA and TBP places the β-sheets of TOA2 and TBP in close proximity, resulting in a continuous 16-strand β-sheet. TFIIA interacts with DNA through basic residues in TOA1C that lie within a loop connecting two β-strands.DNA-protein cross-linking studies have confirmed certain aspects of the structure in solution (34Coulombe B. Li J. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19962-19967Google Scholar, 35Legrange T. Kim T.K. Orphanides G. Ebright Y. Ebright R. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10620-10625Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies show cross-linking was observed between DNA and α upstream of the TATA box, between β and both sides of the TATA box, and with γ at one position upstream of the TATA. In the crystal structure of the yeast complex, only a region homologous to part of the β subunit contacts DNA.To study how TFIIA stabilizes TFIID/TBP binding, we investigated the assembly of the ternary complex containing a mammalian TATA box, human TBP, and human TFIIA. Presently, there is no genetic analysis of the α-β subunit of human TFIIA or crystal structure of free TFIIA. To identify the interactions mediating complex formation, the differences between free TFIIA and complexed TFIIA were characterized using protease footprinting. The interactions of TFIIA with TBP and DNA were identified along with the accessible regions of TFIIA. The results of our protease footprinting studies are placed within the context of the recently solved x-ray structure of the yeast ternary complex."

Classical cytochrome P-450 ligands such as the mechanism-based inactivator 1-aminobenzotriazole did not inhibit iNOS.

The reaction catalyzed by all the NOS isoforms is remarkable in its complexity by utilizing a host of substrates, cofactors, and regulatory factors, including L-Arg, NADPH, dioxygen, FAD, FMN, heme, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), Ca2+, and calmodulin. The NOS reaction mechanism has not been completely elucidated, but it is thought to proceed through two sequential cis-hydroxylations of one of the free guanidino-nitrogens of L-Arg.

Two of the mammalian NOS isoforms are constitutively expressed, neuronal NOS (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS), and the third, inducible NOS (iNOS), is induced under cytokine stimulation within a large variety of cells. Nathan (6Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Google Scholar) and others (7Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Google Scholar, 8Evans T.G. Thai L. Granger D.L. Hibbs Jr., J.B. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 907-915Google Scholar) have estimated that the primary sequences of the mammalian NOS isoforms average 53 ± 2% homology within a species. The conserved cofactor binding sites are contained within two separate structural domains of each subunit of homodimeric NOS (1Marletta M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 314: 488-492Google Scholar, 2Masters B.S.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 131-145Google Scholar, 8Evans T.G. Thai L. Granger D.L. Hibbs Jr., J.B. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 907-915Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain contains the oxygenase activity and binds heme, tetrahydrobiopterin, and the substrate L-Arg. The C-terminal domain has reductase activity (diaphorase) and binds FAD, FMN, and the nicotinamide cosubstrate. The calcium-dependent regulatory protein, calmodulin, binds within a region between the two domains and is thought to regulate electron transfer between the two NOS domains (9Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Google Scholar). For iNOS, calmodulin is tightly associated with the enzyme and represents a distinguishing feature for the inducible versus the constitutively expressed mammalian NOS isoforms (10Xie Q.-W. Cho H.J.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15638-15645Google Scholar). The interaction between these two catalytic domains means that NOS isoforms have within a single protein the complete catalytic machinery of the two-protein microsomal electron transfer system, reminiscent of the bacterial fatty acid monooxygenase cyctochrome P-450BM-3 (12Ravichandran K.G.

Unlike most cytochrome P-450s, however, the heme groups of these NOS isoforms are high spin, yet both iNOS and nNOS can bind imidazole to give low spin heme-imidazole complexes (18McMillan K.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22255-22258Google Scholar) and magnetic circular dichromism (23Sono M. Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Dawson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19943-19948Google Scholar) spectroscopic techniques for studying the heme of rat nNOS further indicate that the heme environment for nNOS is distinct from other heme-containing enzymes such as cytochrome P-450CAM or fungal chloroperoxidase. In order to further investigate the NOS heme domain and its binding specificity compared with that of other human P-450-containing enzymes, we examined a series of human cytochrome P-450 isoform selective and general substrates and inhibitors as potential inhibitors of recombinant human iNOS. We found that iNOS was poorly inhibited by compounds that are general cytochrome P-450 inhibitors, including 1-aminobenzotriazole. Isoform-specific cytochrome P-450 substrates and inhibitors were not recognized by iNOS, except for chlorzoxazone, a cytochrome P-450 2E1 (CYP2E1) substrate (24Peter R. Böcker R. Beaune P.H. Iwasaki M. Guengerich F.P. Yang C.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 566-573Google Scholar, 25Gillam E.M.J. Guo Z. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 59-66Google Scholar). The mechanism of inhibition of iNOS by chlorzoxazone was examined as well as the binding of chlorzoxazone to human and rat hepatic microsomal P-450s.

Benzylhydrazine hydrochloride and metyrapone were purchased from Fluka (Ronkonkoma, NY). Sulfaphenazole was a gift from Dr. T. Shibata (Meiji Yakuhin Co.). All other reagents were of the highest quality available. Recombinant human NOS isoforms were cloned and expressed in the Sf9-baculovirus expression system according to a recent report (26Wolfe G.C.

Purification of iNOS was performed by immunoaffinity chromatography as described elsewhere (27Calaycay J. McCauley E. Griffin P. Wong K. Kelly T. Geller D. MacNaul K. Hutchinson N. Williams H. Mumford R. Schmidt J. Moncada S. Stamler J. Gross S. Higgs E.A. The Biology of Nitric Oxide. Portland Press, London1996: 56Google Scholar). Cell lysates containing recombinant human constitutive NOS isoforms (nNOS and eNOS) were desalted and used without further purification. Human liver microsomes (HLM-UM621: male, caucasian, no drug history, normal liver, protein content of 13.5 mg/ml, P-450 content of 0.3 nmol/mg) was a gift from Dr. Judy Raucy (Agouron Institute, La Jolla, CA). Rat liver microsomes were prepared as described previously (28Wang R.W. Miwa G.T. Argenbright L.S. Lu A.Y.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 3049-3053Google Scholar). NOS activity was determined by a radiometric HPLC assay for L-[2,3,4,5-3H]citrulline produced from L-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arg as described previously (29Robertson C.A. Green B.G. Niedzwiecki L. Harrsion R.K. Grant S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 523-528Google Scholar, 30Green B.G. Chabin R. Grant S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 621-626Google Scholar). A typical assay for L-[3H]citrulline production was carried out for 30 min at room temperature (22°C) in 50 μl of assay buffer containing 0.1 M TES, pH 7.5, 1 μML-Arg, 4 μCi/ml L-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arg, 5 μM FAD, 5 μM FMN, 0.5 mM NADPH, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 10 μM BH4, 0.25 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM CaCl2, and 2-10 μg of enzyme. Enzyme reactions were quenched with 0.1 ml of stop buffer containing 0.2 mM sodium citrate, pH 2.2, 0.2 mML-Arg, 0.2 mML-ornithine, 0.2 mML-citrulline, and 0.02% sodium azide. In preincubation experiments, the enzyme was added to assay buffer containing compound and 0.5 mM NADPH but without L-Arg for 15 min followed by the addition of L-Arg and assayed for 30 min. Conditions for the human hepatic CYP2E1 assay have been reported previously (31Newton D.J. Wang R.W. Lu A.Y.H. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 154-158Google Scholar). Evaluation of the hydroxylation of chlorzoxazone (0.5 mM) by iNOS was performed under similar assay conditions for L-citrulline production (with 0.5 mM NADPH) but without L-Arg for 0, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 2, 3, and 5 h. Reactions (0.18 ml) were quenched with the addition of 20 μl of 85% H3PO4 and centrifuged to remove particulates. HPLC analysis of the reaction products of chlorzoxazone with iNOS or human hepatic microsomal P-450 was performed using a Zorbax SB-C8 (4.6 × 75 mm, 3.5 μm) reverse phase column with a gradient elution from 8 to 65% ammonium acetate in acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 2 ml/min flow rate, and monitoring at 287 nm (30Green B.G. Chabin R. Grant S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 621-626Google Scholar). HPLC retention times for the reaction products were confirmed by comparison with authentic chlorzoxazone and 6-hydroxy-chlorzoxazone as standards. Optical spectra were measured with a Hewlett Packard diode assay spectrophotometer (model HP8452A) equipped with a thermojacketed cell holder and circulating water bath. Spectra of iNOS (75 μg) were recorded at 15°C in 0.3 ml of 20 mM TES, pH 7.4, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate, 5 μM BH4, 2 μM FAD, FMN, and 0.2 M NaCl. Optical spectra of human liver (0.4 mg) and rat liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 (0.3 mg) and were recorded at 25°C in 0.4 ml of 0.1 M KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% lubrol PX. Optical spectra of hemin (6.7 μM) were recorded at 25°C in 0.3 ml of 50 mM TES, pH 7.5. In order to minimize dilution of sample, additions of small volumes (0.3-1 μl) of concentrated imidazole and chlorzoxazone solutions were made to the sample cuvettes with a graduated 10-μl syringe. The inhibitor dissociation constant, Ki, for chlorzoxazone was determined by fitting to the competitive inhibition equation: y = VMS/(S + Km(1 + I/Ki)), where y is initial velocity (pmol L-citrulline/min), S is L-Arg concentration, Km is the Michaelis constant, and I is chlorzoxazone concentration. IC50 and Ki determinations were made in either duplicate or triplicate and are given as average values with standard deviations. Apparent binding constants were determined from the difference spectra of the enzyme-inhibitor complex by fitting the change in absorbance to y = (aI)/(Kapp+ I), where y is the change in absorbance, a is the maximum absorbance change, I is the inhibitor concentration, and Kapp is the apparent inhibitor dissociation constant. The equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, for chlorzoxazone with iNOS was calculated after correction for the presence of imidazole, according to Kapp = Kd(1 + I/Kim) where I is the concentration of imidazole and Kim is the imidazole dissociation constant. A series of general cytochrome P-450 inhibitors and isoform-selective cytochrome P-450 substrates and inhibitors were tested as potential inhibitors of recombinant human iNOS. The evaluation of general cytochrome P-450 inhibitors included reversible inhibitors and mechanism-based inactivators such as 1-aminobenzotriazole (32Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Mico B.A. Mathews J.M. Kunze K.L. Miwa G.T. Lu A.Y.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 210: 717-728Google Scholar, 33Knickle L.C. Bend J.R. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1992; 70: 1610-1617Google Scholar). All of these compounds have been reported to inhibit or inactivate many cytochrome P-450s and therefore are not regarded as selective toward any single class of cytochrome P-450. In addition to the use of cytochrome P-450-specific antisera (34Gelboin H.V. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 413-453Google Scholar), the identification of a particular cytochrome P-450 activity can be determined by using a panel of compounds whose inhibitory activity or metabolism is associated with specific cytochrome P-450 isoforms, e.g. 1A1 or 2E1 (30Green B.G. Chabin R. Grant S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 621-626Google Scholar, 35Halpert J.R. Guengerich F.P. Bend J.R. Correia M.A. Toxicol. Appl.

We have examined both general cytochrome P-450 inhibitors and a series of cytochrome P-450 isoform selective substrates and inhibitors against iNOS in order to characterize its activity compared with human cytochrome P-450s. Each compound was tested at 0.1 mM against 1 μML-Arg either competitively or by first preincubating the compound with iNOS for 15 min in the presence of NADPH. Preincubation of compounds with enzyme in the presence of NADPH was used to evaluated possible mechanism-based inactivation of iNOS. Human iNOS activity was not inhibited by any of the general cytochrome P-450 inhibitors tested at 0.1 mM (Table I) even after preincubation with the enzyme in the presence of iNOS cofactors and NADPH. 1-Aminobenzotriazole is a NADPH-dependent mechanism-based inactivator of many cytochrome P-450s and inactivates by alkylation of the heme group (38Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Mathews J.M. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 761-764Google Scholar). This compound had no effect on iNOS activity. For hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450s, the concentration of 0.1 mM 1-aminobenzotriazole was reported to be sufficient for the inactivation of enzyme activity (39Woodcroft K.J. Bend J.R. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1989; 68: 1278-1285Google Scholar). Its inhibitory activity is specific for cytochrome P-450-containing monooxygenases and does not affect other hemeproteins such as cytochrome b5 (40Mugford C.A. Mortillo M. Mico B.A. Tarloff J.B. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1992; 19: 43-49Google Scholar). Likewise, the mechanism-based cytochrome P-450 inactivator benzylhydrazine (41Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Augusto O. Viola F. Kunze K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8623-8629Google Scholar) had no detectable inhibition of iNOS. The P-450 ligands cyanide and azide were poor inhibitors of iNOS at 0.1 mM. iNOS activity was unaffected by NaN3 (up to 10 mM); however, KCN inhibited iNOS activity by greater than 75% at 5 mM. Apparently, iNOS binds low molecular weight anions very weakly. Together, these results demonstrate the uniqueness of iNOS activity compared with human cytochrome P-450 enzymes and most likely reflects the affinity of iNOS for cationic groups such as L-Arg rather than hydrophobic aromatics and anions.Table I.Effect of general cytochrome P-450 inhibitors against iNOSInhibitorRelative activityPI = 0 minaDetermined from relative values of L-[3H]citrulline formation at 0.1 mM compound against 1 μM L-Arg.

Open table in a new tab The identity of a particular hepatic cytochrome P-450 activity can be determined by the use of cytochrome P-450 isoform selective substrates and inhibitors (30Green B.G. Chabin R. Grant S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 621-626Google Scholar, 35Halpert J.R. Guengerich F.P. Bend J.R. Correia M.A. Toxicol. Appl.

Because these compounds are representative of substrates and inhibitors for the major human cytochrome P-450 families, they may be useful for determining if iNOS activity is similar to any human cytochrome P-450 activity. A panel of 30 compounds composed of human cytochrome P-450 isoform selective substrates and inhibitors were tested as inhibitors of iNOS. Table II summarizes the effect of these compounds against iNOS L-citrulline formation using 1 μML-Arg. Only one compound, chlorzoxazone (5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzoxazole) (Fig. 1) showed any significant inhibition of iNOS. Chlorzoxazone is a substrate for CYP2E1 (24Peter R. Böcker R. Beaune P.H. Iwasaki M. Guengerich F.P. Yang C.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 566-573Google Scholar, 25Gillam E.M.J. Guo Z. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 59-66Google Scholar), undergoing 6-hydroxylation, although some minor 6-hydroxylation has also been reported with cytochrome P-450 1A1 (42Carriere V. Goasduff T. Ratanasavanh D. Morel F. Gautier J.-C. Guillouzo A. Beaune P. Berthou F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 852-857Google Scholar, 43Jayyosi Z. Knoble D. Muc M. Erick J. Thomas P.E. Kelly M. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

However, two other CYP2E1 substrates, zoxazolamine, structurally similar to chlorzoxazone (see Fig. 1), and acetaminophen, did not inhibit iNOS. Moreover, the CYP2E1 inhibitors: disulfiram, 4-methylpyrazole, and diethyldithiocarbamic acid, were not inhibitors of iNOS. Whereas the inhibition of iNOS by chlorzoxazone suggests that iNOS may have similar substrate affinity as CYP2E1 (or cytochrome P-450 1A1), it is unlikely because none of the other CYP2E1 (or cytochrome P-450 1A1) selective compounds were inhibitors of iNOS. Also it is noteworthy that debrisoquine, which contains a guanidino-group, was not an inhibitor of iNOS even though debrisoquine can be hydroxylated to NG-hydroxy-debrisoquine by rat liver microsomal P-450 (45Clement B. Schultze-Mosgau M.-H. Wohlers H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 2249-2267Google Scholar). Overall, the lack of inhibitory activity of general and isoform-selective cytochrome P-450 substrates and inhibitors toward iNOS demonstrates that iNOS substrate and inhibitor binding is unique from that of human cytochrome P-450 enzymes.Table II.Effect of cytochrome P-450-selective substrates and inhibitors against iNOSRelative activityaDetermined in duplicate from relative values of L-[3H]citrulline formation at 0.1 mM compound against 1 μM L-Arg.CYP1A1InhibitorsEllipticine0.947,8-Benzoflavone0.93CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18SubstratesBenzphetamine1.00Phenytoin0.79Tolbutamide1.00Warfarin1.26InhibitorsSulfaphenazole0.97CYP2E1SubstratesAcetaminophen1.01Chlorzoxazone0.10Zoxazolamine0.98InhibitorsDDCAbDDCA, diethyldithiocarbamic acid.0.99Disulfiram0.964-Methyl pyrazole0.89CYP1A2SubstratesCaffeine0.96Phenacetin0.94Tacrine0.97InhibitorsEnoxacin1.01Furafylline0.88CYP2D6SubstratesDebrisoquine0.92Dextromethorphan1.14Metoxyphenamine0.88Perphenazine0.74Propranolol0.85InhibitorsQuinidine0.89CYP3A4SubstratesDapsone0.92Erythromycin0.93Nifedipine0.89InhibitorsKetoconazole1.01(+)-Naringenin1.05Troleandomycin0.89a Determined in duplicate from relative values of L-[3H]citrulline formation at 0.1 mM compound against 1 μM L-Arg.b DDCA, diethyldithiocarbamic acid. Open table in a new tab Chlorzoxazone was titrated against 1 μML-Arg and inhibited iNOS L-citrulline production with an IC50 value of 6.9 ± 1.8 μM. The inhibition of iNOS by chlorzoxazone was competitive with respect to L-Arg with Ki = 3.3 ± 0.7 μM (Fig. 2). 6-Hydroxy-chlorzoxazone (see Fig. 1) was a less potent inhibitor of iNOS (relative activity = 0.52 @ 0.1 mM), but zoxazolamine did not inhibit iNOS even at 0.5 mM. Chlorzoxazone was also tested against recombinant human nNOS and eNOS as a measure of NOS isoform selectivity. IC50 values for the inhibition of nNOS and eNOS by chlorzoxazone were 12.9 ± 0.8 and 8.5 ± 0.5 μM, respectively, against 1 μML-Arg. Chlorzoxazone inhibited all three human NOS isoforms with nearly equal potency. Although CYP2E1 catalyzes the 6-hydroxylation of chlorzoxazone, the likelihood of iNOS catalyzing the hydroxylation of a benzoxazole is remote because the substrate specificity of NOS isoforms is reported to be restricted to close L-Arg structural analogs such as L-homoarginine or NG-hydroxy-L-arginine (1Marletta M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 314: 488-492Google Scholar, 3Stuehr D.J. Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Griffith O.W. Feldman P.L. Wiseman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6259-6263Google Scholar, 46Sennequier N. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5883-5892Google Scholar). Although unlikely, this possibility was examined by incubating iNOS with chlorzoxazone under normal assay conditions with NADPH but without L-Arg. As a control we also incubated chlorzoxazone and NADPH with human hepatic microsomal P-450. The products were then analyzed by HPLC using authentic chlorzoxazone (6.4 min) and 6-hydroxy-chlorzoxazone (4.1 min) as standards. Fig. 3 shows representative HPLC traces for the products of chlorzoxazone with hepatic microsomal P-450 and iNOS. 6-Hydroxy-chlorzoxazone (4.1 min) was produced from chlorzoxazone (6.4 min) after incubation with hepatic microsomal P-450 (Fig. 3A). However, there was no detectable 6-hydroxy-chlorzoxazone or other products formed after 5 h of incubation of 0.5 mM chlorzoxazone with iNOS (at an enzyme concentration 10 times greater than for normal assays) (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that chlorzoxazone does not undergo any significant 6-hydroxylation by iNOS. Because the inhibition of iNOS by chlorzoxazone is competitive with respect to L-Arg, chlorzoxazone is most likely binding within the heme domain. Perturbation of the heme optical spectra upon ligand binding has been used to characterize the mode of binding of substrates and inhibitors within the active sites of hemeproteins (47Schenkman J.B.

Pergamon Press, Oxford1982: 587Google Scholar). The binding of various compounds to hemeproteins can induce low spin or high spin transitions of the heme iron, which accounts for the observed shifts in the heme optical spectra. For membrane-bound cytochrome P-450s the optical heme spectra can be complicated by the presence of detergents and other factors that can affect the spin state (49Schenkman J.B. Sligar S.G.

https://openalex.org/W2006607104,"A lymphocyte-specific murine Ltk tyrosine kinase isoform was previously found to reside in the endoplasmic reticulum and to be potently activated upon treatment of cells with alkylating or thiol-oxidizing agents. Based on these observations, a unique role for Ltk was proposed as an endoplasmic reticulum-resident transmembrane kinase regulated by redox changes (Bauskin, A. R., Alkalay, I., and Ben-Neriah, Y. (1991) Cell 66, 685-696). To analyze why this Ltk isoform is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, we investigated its behavior in over-expressing cells. Our results indicate that lymphoid Ltk exhibits a dual Nexo/Ccyt and Ncyt/Cexo transmembrane topology in transfected cells. This unusual behavior may be responsible for retention in the endoplasmic reticulum since mutants with an increased number of positive amino acids downstream of the transmembrane segment exhibit a conventional Nexo/Ccyt orientation and proceed to the cell surface. Endoplasmic reticulum-retained Ltk forms a prominent complex with the chaperone calnexin, suggesting that Ltk may be retained by the mechanism that prevents surface expression of inappropriately folded proteins or incompletely assembled protein complexes.

Endoplasmic reticulum-retained Ltk forms a prominent complex with the chaperone calnexin, suggesting that Ltk may be retained by the mechanism that prevents surface expression of inappropriately folded proteins or incompletely assembled protein complexes. Ltk is a membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase that is most closely related to the product of the human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ALK proto-oncogene (1Ben-Neriah Y. Bauskin A.R. Nature. 1988; 333: 672-676Google Scholar, 2Morris S.W. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Dittmer K.G. Shapiro D.N. Saltman D.L. Look A.T. Science. 1994; 263: 1281-1284Google Scholar). The restricted expression pattern of murine Ltk in subsets of lymphoid and neuronal cells initially suggested a role as a receptor for an unknown lymphoid or neuronal growth or differentiation factor (3Bernards A. de la Monte S.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2279-2287Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis became less likely when one of the most widely expressed Ltk isoforms was found to reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorLtkleukocyte tyrosine kinaseTMtransmembraneendo Hendoglycosidase HPBSphosphate-buffered salineJMjuxtamembrane. where the protein showed extensive disulfide-linked oligomerization concomitant with potent activation of its kinase activity upon treatment of cells with alkylating or thiol-oxidizing agents. Based on this observation, a unique function for Ltk was proposed, as a ligand-independent ER-resident kinase regulated by redox changes (4Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1991; 66: 685-696Google Scholar). endoplasmic reticulum epidermal growth factor receptor leukocyte tyrosine kinase transmembrane endoglycosidase H phosphate-buffered saline juxtamembrane. Several observations complicated this hypothesis, however. First, its low expression level makes endogenous Ltk protein hard to detect, even by such sensitive methods as immune complex kinase labeling (3Bernards A. de la Monte S.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2279-2287Google Scholar). The most convincing results arguing for ER residence were thus obtained with Ltk over-expressing transfected cells (4Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1991; 66: 685-696Google Scholar). In these cells, Ltk undergoes extensive oligomerization, which may have contributed to its ER retention. Second, ER retention and redox regulation was demonstrated for only one of at least four murine Ltk isoforms. The analyzed protein is unusual for harboring only 109 amino acids upstream of its transmembrane (TM) segment and is encoded by a lymphocyte-specific mRNA that includes an unconventional CUG translational start codon (3Bernards A. de la Monte S.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2279-2287Google Scholar). A subsequently identified human LTK cDNA, extended further upstream, included a regular AUG start codon and predicted a receptor kinase with a considerably larger putative ligand-binding segment (5Krolewski J.J. Dalla-Favera R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2911-2919Google Scholar). Although the identification of the larger human LTK gene product shed some doubt on the significance of the ER-retained murine isoform, we subsequently found that mRNAs predicting analogous larger murine Ltk proteins also existed but had very restricted neuronal expression patterns (6Snijders A.J. Haase V.H. Bernards A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 27-35Google Scholar). Because transport to the cell surface is believed to occur by default once mammalian proteins enter the ER (7Pfeffer S. Rothman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 829-852Google Scholar, 8Wieland F.T. Gleason M.L. Serafini T.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 289-300Google Scholar), Ltk must be retained either because it contains an ER retention/retrieval signal (9Pelham H.R.B. Munro S. Cell. 1993; 75: 603-605Google Scholar) or because it is recognized by chaperones that prevent transport of incorrectly folded proteins or partially assembled protein complexes (10Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Google Scholar). To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the intracellular trafficking of the lymphoid Ltk isoform in over-expressing transfected cells. Our results argue that ER retention may not be the normal fate of Ltk and provide support for the hypothesis that positively charged amino acids adjacent to membrane spanning segments play important roles in determining the TM topology of some integral membrane proteins (11Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Google Scholar, 12Boyd D. Beckwith J. Cell. 1990; 62: 1031-1033Google Scholar). To generate mutants, we transferred the insert of the pltk2.2 cDNA (3Bernards A. de la Monte S.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2279-2287Google Scholar) to the pALTER vector and used the Altered Sites mutagenesis system (Promega) to change the asparagines of five N-X-S/T potential glycosylation acceptor sites into serines. The same strategy was used to change uncharged juxtamembrane residues into positively charged ones. Oligonucleotides used to mutate glycosylation sites were: NS1, AAG CAT CCC AGC TGC AGT CAC TG; NS2, AGC TGT GGA TAG TGT CAC TTG CAT; NS3, TCA CCA GCC AGT GTC ACT CTA C; NS4, CAG GCT GGG AAG CAG GTC ACT G; and NS5, GAA CAG TGC AGT GGC TCC TCC TCA. The juxtamembrane mutants were made using primers Ltk-JM-Pos1, CTA GTG AAC CAG AAG CGT AAG GGC CTG TGG GGG ACC, and Ltk-JM-Pos2, AAC CAG AAG TGT CAG CGC CTG CGG GGG ACC AGG CTG CCA. All mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. Wild-type and mutant cDNAs were expressed using the SV40 promoter containing expression vector pJ3ω (13Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1068Google Scholar). Ltk-human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) hybrids were generated by PCR amplifying human EGFR cDNA segments with hybrid Ltk-EGFR oligonucleotides. The Ltk-TM-EGFR hybrid was made using oligonucleotides (5ʹ) AAA GAGCTA GCT GGG CCA GGT CTT GAA GGC TG and (3ʹ) AAA CGA AGC TTA AGC TCC CTC TCC TGC AGC AG. Unique NheI and HindIII sites (underlined) were used to subclone the amplified fragment into the Ltk expression vector. The Ltk-JM-EGFR construct was made using 5ʹ-primer ATG TGT GCA GTC CTG ATT CTA GTG AAG CGC CAC ATC GTT CGG AAG CGC ACG and the 3ʹ Ltk-TM-EGFR primer. Subcloning was by means of BsgI and HindIII sites. Subconfluent NIH 3T3 cells were transfected as described (14Graham F. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Google Scholar) using 10 μg of Ltk expression vector and 1 μg of pSV2neo as a selectable marker. Ltk expression in G418 (0.5 mg/ml) resistant clones was analyzed by RNA blots and immunoprecipitations. Transient expression of Ltk in COS cells was achieved by DEAE-dextran transfection as described (6Snijders A.J. Haase V.H. Bernards A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 27-35Google Scholar). Briefly, approximately 10 μg of plasmid was transfected per subconfluent 9-cm culture dish, and cells were labeled for 4 h with 0.3 mCi of 35S-labeled amino acids (Translabel; DuPont NEN) 2 days after transfection. In pulse-chase experiments, cells were labeled for 30 min before adding an excess (5 mM) of non-radioactive methionine to the culture medium. Cells were lysed in Triton buffer (1% Triton X-100, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each of antipain, aprotinin, and chymostatin. Cell lysates were precleared for 1 h with 10 μg of rabbit IgG conjugated to protein A-Sepharose and subsequently immunoprecipitated with 2 μl of rabbit anti-Ltk serum (3Bernards A. de la Monte S.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2279-2287Google Scholar) for 16 h at 40C. Immune complexes collected with protein A-Sepharose were washed six times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (15Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels or digested first with endoglycosidase H (endo H) or N-glycanase using conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Genzyme). To detect Ltk on the cell surface, live transfected COS cells grown on glass coverslips were placed on ice and incubated with either polyclonal Ltk antiserum or preimmune serum for 1 h. After five washes in ice-cold PBS, the cells were incubated on ice with a fluorescein-conjugated F(ab)2 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Caltag Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) for 30 min and washed as before. Dilutions of the antisera in PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide were chosen so that untransfected cells exhibited minimal background fluorescence. The cells were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and mounted in glycerol containing 2.3% (w/v) DABCO (1,4-diazobicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane, Sigma), 10% (v/v) 0.2 M Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.02% NaN3. Staining of permeabilized cells was performed at room temperature. Cells were first fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, then permeabilized with 0.05% saponin in PBS for 5 min, and subsequently stained and mounted as described above. The antisera were diluted in PBS with 0.05% saponin. Stained cells were viewed with an Olympus BH2-RFL fluorescence microscope at × 600 magnification using oil immersion and photographed using Kodak T-MAX 400 film and the Olympus PM-10ADS photomicrographic system. Four Ltk proteins that differ upstream of their TM segment are encoded by tissue-specific murine mRNAs that arise by alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage. A pair of alternatively spliced transcripts that we have only detected in the C1300/Neuro-2A neuronal cell line (6Snijders A.J. Haase V.H. Bernards A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 27-35Google Scholar) includes standard AUG start codons and predicts proteins with 360 and 421 amino acids upstream of their TM domains (Fig. 1, Isoforms C and D). Two mRNAs expressed in several lymphoid cell lines and in brain include CUG start codons and predict proteins with 109 and 170 amino acid upstream segments (Fig. 1, isoforms A and B). The lymphocyte-specific isoform A protein was previously found to be retained in the ER (4Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1991; 66: 685-696Google Scholar). COS cells transfected with isoform A vectors produce two 72- and 78-kDa anti-Ltk immunoreactive glycoproteins (Fig. 2, lane 2). Endoglycosidase H, which specifically removes asparagine-linked sugar groups that have not undergone modification by Golgi-resident α-mannosidase (16Tarentino A.L. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 811-817Google Scholar), trims both glycoproteins to a single 69-kDa species (Fig. 2, lane 3). Since asparagine-linked glycosylation occurs in the lumen of the ER (18Hubbard S.C. Ivatt R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 555-583Google Scholar) and since Ltk contains only two N-X-S/T potential glycosylation acceptor sites upstream of its TM segment, we and others previously suggested that differential glycosylation of either one or both of these sites may explain the two observed glycoproteins (3Bernards A. de la Monte S.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2279-2287Google Scholar, 4Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1991; 66: 685-696Google Scholar). However, since one of the upstream glycosylation sites (N2 in the diagram in Fig. 2) maps only 13 residues upstream of the TM segment, and since recent studies suggest that glycosylation sites close to TM segments may not be recognized by oligosaccharyl transferase (17Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Google Scholar), we further analyzed the nature of the 72/78-kDa doublet. To this end, we transfected COS cells with isoform A mutants in which either one or both of the upstream glycosylation acceptor sites had been disrupted by targeted asparagine to serine substitutions. Fig. 2, lanes 4-6, shows proteins precipitated from cells transfected with glycosylation site mutants NS2, NS1, and NS1+2 (NS refers to the sequence change; the numbers identify the sites mutated; see diagram in Fig. 2). As shown in lane 4, disrupting the N-X-S/T motif closest to the TM segment of Ltk did not alter the glycosylation of isoform A. Since a mutant with a single glycosylation site upstream of its TM segment thus continues to incorporate more than one endo H-sensitive oligosaccharide, sites elsewhere in Ltk must also be modified. Indeed, although disruption of the most upstream N-X-S/T motif resulted in the conversion of the 72-kDa protein into a 69-kDa form (lane 5), which was not further reduced in size upon endo H digestion (not shown), the 78-kDa glycoprotein was unaffected by this mutation. The 78-kDa glycoprotein also remained when both upstream N-X-S/T motifs were mutated together (lane 6). The part of Ltk downstream of its TM segment, which we had assumed to reside in the cytoplasm, harbors three additional N-X-S/T motifs (see diagram in Fig. 2). To test whether glycosylation of these sites accounted for the 78-kDa species, we disrupted all three motifs by asparagine to serine substitutions. Fig. 2, lane 7, shows that disrupting the downstream motifs did not affect the 72-kDa glycoprotein, but resulted in the conversion of the 78-kDa species into a 69-kDa protein that comigrates with unglycosylated Ltk. Mutating individual downstream sites resulted in intermediate size reductions, suggesting that all three sites are glycosylated (not shown). Disrupting all five glycosylation sites at either side of the TM segment of the Ltk prevented all glycosylation (lane 8). Because addition of asparagine-linked core sugars occurs exclusively in the lumen of the ER (18Hubbard S.C. Ivatt R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 555-583Google Scholar), isoform A must be inserted into the ER membrane of transfected cells in both an Nexo/Ccyt (type I) and an inverted Ncyt/Cexo (type II) orientation (Fig. 3). To rule out that this unusual behavior is caused by over-expression, we generated stably transfected NIH 3T3 clones expressing approximately 100-fold less protein. Similar ratios of the 72- and 78-kDa glycoproteins were detected in all analyzed stable transfectants (e.g. Fig. 2, lane 9). Since a similar 72/78-kDa doublet also was previously detected in a murine B lymphocyte cell line (4Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1991; 66: 685-696Google Scholar) and upon in vitro translation of isoform A mRNA in the presence of microsomes (3Bernards A. de la Monte S.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2279-2287Google Scholar), we conclude that isoform A Ltk exhibits a mixed TM topology in vitro and in several cell types expressing widely varying protein levels. ER retention of several proteins, including unassembled components of integral membrane protein complexes, is mediated by the ER resident chaperone calnexin (19Rajagopalan S. Xu Y. Brenner M.B. Science. 1994; 263: 387-390Google Scholar). To examine whether calnexin or other chaperones play a role in the ER retention of Ltk, we precipitated potential Ltk-containing complexes after lysing metabolically labeled transfected COS cells in 0.6% CHAPS. A 90-kDa protein, identical in size to calnexin, co-precipitated with isoform A Ltk under these conditions (Fig. 4, lane 3). The 90-kDa protein was not detected in precipitates from mock transfected cells (lane 1) and was unambiguously identified as calnexin in sequential immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting experiments, using anti-Ltk to precipitate and anti-calnexin to detect the blotted protein or vice versa (not shown). Interestingly, the 78-kDa glycoprotein was the predominant calnexin-associated species in these experiments (Fig. 4, lane 4). Since calnexin preferentially binds the 78-kDa inverted Ltk protein, we tested whether Ltk mutants with a predominant type I TM topology escaped ER retention. It is important to note in this respect that isoform A lacks an obvious N-terminal signal sequence (3Bernards A. de la Monte S.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2279-2287Google Scholar) and shows no obvious bias of positive charges flanking its TM segment. Since the TM topology of integral membrane proteins without cleavable signal sequences is believed to be determined by the ratio of charged amino acids flanking their TM segments, with the most positive side in the cytoplasm (11Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Google Scholar, 12Boyd D. Beckwith J. Cell. 1990; 62: 1031-1033Google Scholar), we analyzed the trafficking of several Ltk mutants that were engineered to contain extra positive amino acids downstream of the TM segment. Initial mutants were made by replacing membrane-flanking segments of Ltk with the corresponding parts of the EGFR. Because the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane segment of the EGFR is highly positively charged (Fig. 5), Ltk hybrids containing this segment would be expected to exhibit an altered TM topology. Indeed, both Ltk-TM-EGFR and Ltk-JM-EGFR hybrids that harbor the EGFR juxtamembrane segment (see map in Fig. 5, and see “Experimental Procedures” for details), did not show the glycoprotein doublet indicative of a mixed TM topology. Rather, the predominant species observed in cells transfected with these mutants resembled type I oriented isoform A both in its size (∼72 kDa) and in the modest size reduction upon endo H digestion (Fig. 5, lanes 1-4). To directly test whether the increased number of positive charges in the juxtamembrane region was responsible for the altered behavior of the Ltk-EGFR hybrids, we made two additional mutants (Ltk-JM-Pos1 and Ltk-JM-Pos2) by site-directed mutagenesis. Each mutant harbored two additional lysine or arginine residues at the positions indicated in Fig. 5. COS cells transfected with both mutants predominantly expressed a 72-kDa endo H-sensitive (shown for the Ltk-JM-Pos1 mutant in Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 6). We infer from these results that in a manner similar to that observed for other proteins (11Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Google Scholar, 12Boyd D. Beckwith J. Cell. 1990; 62: 1031-1033Google Scholar), the TM topology of isoform A Ltk can be modified by changing the number of charged residues downstream of its TM segment. All Ltk mutants that exhibit a predominant type I TM topology show a diffuse higher molecular weight species in immunoprecipitates (arrow in Fig. 5). We argued that this slower migrating species, which is not seen upon transfection of wild-type isoform A, might represent protein that has undergone Golgi-specific oligosaccharide modifications. To test this, we performed pulse-chase labeling and endoglycosidase digestion experiments. In pulse-chase experiments, cells transfected with the Ltk-TM-EGFR hybrid did not show the slower migrating species at early time points. At later time points, this species became progressively more prominent, consistent with it representing a processed end product (Fig. 6, left panel). The higher molecular weight species was resistant to endo H, but sensitive to N-glycanase digestion, suggesting the presence of Golgi-specific oligosaccharide modifications (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, right panel). We conclude that Ltk mutants with a predominant type I TM topology proceed beyond the ER to the Golgi. To analyze whether Ltk juxtamembrane mutants proceed beyond the Golgi to the cell surface, we stained live, non-permeabilized transfected cells by indirect immunofluorescence. In contrast to COS cells transfected with a wild-type isoform A construct, 20-30% of cells transfected with the two Ltk-EGFR hybrids or with both site-directed mutants showed unambiguous surface fluorescence (Fig. 7). A type I TM topology thus correlates with cell surface expression of Ltk mutants. However, staining of saponin-permeabilized transfected cells showed that most mutant protein remained localized to the ER, indicating that surface transport of the mutant proteins remains inefficient (Fig. 7). A unique role for Ltk as a redox sensing tyrosine kinase was proposed, when a widely expressed murine Ltk isoform was found to reside in the ER, and to undergo extensive disulfide-linked oligomerization concomitant with a 20-fold activation of its kinase activity upon treatment of cells with alkylating or thiol-oxidizing agents (4Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1991; 66: 685-696Google Scholar). Because transport to the cell surface is believed to occur by default when mammalian proteins enter the ER, we analyzed in this study why isoform A Ltk is ER retained. Our results indicate that isoform A Ltk exhibits a highly unusual dual TM topology in transfected cells and forms a prominent complex with the ER resident chaperone calnexin. The association with calnexin suggests that isoform A Ltk may be ER retained by the mechanism that prevents surface expression of incompletely folded proteins or partially assembled protein complexes. Its unusual dual TM topology may reflect the fact that isoform A lacks a functional N-terminal signal sequence. Indeed, as has also been observed for other integral membrane proteins without cleavable signal peptides, the TM topology of isoform A can be altered by increasing the number of positively charged amino acids downstream of the TM segment. Interestingly, all mutants that exhibit a predominant type I TM topology show evidence of proceeding beyond the ER to the cell surface. However, transport to the cell surface remains inefficient since most mutant protein remains endo H-sensitive and remains localized to the ER in immunofluorescent staining experiments. Several other points regarding the unusual behavior of Ltk are worth making. First, although calnexin predominantly associates with the 78-kDa inverted isoform A species, both topological forms of Ltk are ER-retained when co-expressed. This may be explained by the fact that isoform A undergoes extensive oligomerization in transfected cells (4Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1991; 66: 685-696Google Scholar). Second, the potent stimulation of the kinase activity of isoform A upon treatment of cells with thiol oxidizing agents may relate to its inverted TM topology and reflect oxidation of amino acids within the catalytic segment of the protein. Finally, although we have not extensively analyzed the trafficking of other Ltk isoforms, we previously noted that isoform C Ltk is also largely ER-retained (6Snijders A.J. Haase V.H. Bernards A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 27-35Google Scholar). This ER retention cannot be attributed to an inverted TM topology of this protein since isoform C Ltk harbors a typical N-terminal signal peptide and shows no evidence of a dual TM topology when over-expressed. 2A. J. Snijders, and A. Bernards, unpublished results. Different mechanisms may thus contribute to the ER retention of different Ltk isoforms. We thank Kristian Helin for a human EGFR cDNA."
