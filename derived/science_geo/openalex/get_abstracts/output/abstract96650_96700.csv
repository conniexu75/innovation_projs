https://openalex.org/W1763394000,"Six neutral glycosphingolipids were isolated from purified preparations of human neutrophils. The chemical structure of each compound was characterized by degradation with exoglycosidases, methylation analysis, and electron impact/desorption mass spectrometry. The following structures were assigned on the basis of these detailed analyses: Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer Gal beta 1 leads to 1Cer Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer Gal alpha 1 leads to 4Gal beta 1 leads to 1Cer GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer. Neutral glycosphingolipids containing N-acetylgalactosamine were not detected in human neutrophils. The major neutral glycosphingolipids were lactosylceramide and lactoneotetraosylceramide. Although lactoneotriaosylceramide accounts for only 10% of the neutral glycosphingolipid fraction, neutrophils are the most readily available source of this compound. We may conclude that human neutrophils, in contrast to human erythrocytes and platelets, contain as their major neutral glycosphingolipids lactoneo-type structures and smaller amounts of gala-type structures. These findings are discussed in terms of blood group antigens and glycosphingolipid changes due to malignancy."

https://openalex.org/W1593421540,"The role of metal ions in the mechanism of action of bovine liver porphobilinogen synthase was investigated. Studies with chelating agents were consistent with a requirement of metal ions for enzyme activity, and the use of 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid suggested that Zn2+ was present in the enzyme. The low activity detected in metal-free apoporphobilinogen synthase was attributed to adventitious metal ions. Addition of Zn2+ to the apoenzyme completely restored enzyme activity if the essential sulfhydryl groups on the enzyme were first reduced with sulfhydryl reagents. It does not follow necessarily from this observation that Zn2+ forms a bond with a sulfhydryl group in the enzyme. However, we also observed that Zn2+ did not bind to the enzyme unless the essential cysteinyl residues were reduced. We have concluded that the octameric enzyme contains 4 g atoms of Zn2+/mol from our enzyme activity measurements and binding studies. Alkylation of the enzyme resulted in a marked reduction in the binding of Zn2+ to the enzyme. These observations are consistent with the suggestion that the interaction of the Zn2+ ions with the enzyme occurs with sulfhydryl groups at the active site. It appears that Zn2+ does not participate in substrate binding nor in the maintenance of the quaternary structure of the enzyme. Possible mechanistic roles for Zn2+ in porphobilinogen synthase are discussed. It should be noted that Cd2+ was the only other element found which restored activity to the apoenzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1554052265,"The DNA polymerase alpha from regenerating rat liver has been purified to near homogeneity. The most highly purified fraction gave a single stained band on native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and DNA polymerase alpha activity was coincident with this band. On pore gradient gel electrophoresis, a molecular radius of 72 A was obtained for the enzyme. On denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, five polypeptides were reproducibly resolved, corresponding to molecular weights of 156,000, 64,000, 61,000, 58,000, and 54,000. The catalytic subunit correlated with the 156,000-dalton polypeptide. In the native state, the separated 54,000- to 64,000-dalton polypeptides interacted among themselves to constitute a hetero oligomer of apparent high molecular weight without DNA polymerase activity. Electron microscopy studies of the enzyme confirmed the biochemical results. The specific activity of the isolated catalytic subunit was in all cases lower than when it was associated with the 54,000- to 64,000-dalton structure."
https://openalex.org/W2101756276,"The human continuous leukemia cell line K562 synthesizes and expresses on its surface the major red cell sialoglycoprotein, glycophorin A. Glycophorin A contains 1 N-glycosidic and 15 O-glycosidic oligosaccharides, which are attached to known sites on the polypeptide chain. By immune precipitation with specific anti-glycophorin A antiserum of radioactively labeled cells followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we have been able to study its biosynthesis in considerable detail. The synthesis of the N-glycosidic oligosaccharide of glycophorin A is inhibited by the antibiotic tunicamycin, while the O-glycosidic oligosaccharides are not affected. Incomplete glycophorin A, lacking the N-glycosidic oligosaccharide, is apparently incorporated normally into the surface membrane, but the total amount of glycophorin A is decreased. Thus, N-glycosylation is not necessary for externalization of glycophorin A."
https://openalex.org/W1565756280,"A verdohemoprotein was formed from Compound I of horseradish peroxidase C upon the addition of about 2 molar equivalents of m-nitroperoxybenzoic acid (mNPBA) or hydroperoxide formed from indole-3-acetic acid during its catalytic oxidation. The formation of the verdohemoprotein occurred via two intermediates which have an absorbance peak at 965 or 940 nm. Carbon monoxide was evolved in the reaction from the 940 compound to the verdohemoprotein. From the kinetic and titration data, the following reaction sequence was proposed. (Formula: see text). The 940 compound could be reduced by dithionite and ascorbate to the ferrous and the ferric enzyme, respectively. The enzyme species that reacted with mNPBA to form the 965 and the 940 compounds was concluded to be Compound I but neither Compound II nor oxyperoxidase (Compound III)."

https://openalex.org/W1608621444,"The assembly of pure tubulin into microtubules is induced by Mn(II), and the polymerized product displays the characteristic sensitivity of normal microtubules to low temperature. The interaction of Mn(II) with tubulin purified by phosphocellulose chromatography to remove microtubule-associated proteins was investigated using electron paramagnetic resonance and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Mn(II) interacts with tubulin at about one high affinity site with an apparent dissociation constant (KD) of 1.6 +/- 0.3 microM and at 8 +/- 2 low affinity (KD = 0.38 +/- 0.18 mM) sites. The binding of Mn(II) to tubulin at the high affinity site was accompanied by release of tubulin-bound Mg(II) from the protein. Thus, Mn(II) substitutes for Mg(II) at the high affinity site and in promoting the assembly of tubulin. Mg(II), Co(II), and Zn(II) can displace Mn(II) from manganese-tubulin, but Ca(II) cannot. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum at 9.1 GHz of Mn(II) bound to the high affinity divalent cation site of tubulin is characterized by broadened hyperfine structure and the absence of solid state spectral features, suggesting that the bulk solvent is accessible to the bound metal ion."
https://openalex.org/W1670486417,"The two major forms of rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase have been resolved by calcium phosphate chromatography and have been highly purified. These different forms of the enzyme contain dissimilar amounts of endogenous protein-bound phosphate. The hydroxylase activity of these forms, as assayed in the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin, can be differentially stimulated by treatment with Mg2+, ATP, cyclic AMP, and protein kinase, leading to the production of a chromatographically distinct species. In the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP, activation is accompanied by differential incorporation of 32P into the subunits (Mr = 50,000) of the two enzyme forms leading to a new form which contains 1 mol of phosphate/subunit. In addition, phosphorylation in vitro eliminates the electrophoretic heterogeneity displayed by the isolated forms. These data show that the multiple forms and electrophoretic heterogeneity of phenylalanine hydroxylase are correlated with the degree of phosphorylation and also provide further evidence for the regulation of this enzyme by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1589122120,"The dynamics of human apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) interaction with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles were investigated in a 4000:1 DMPC/apo A-I (mol/mol) mixture where all the protein is bound to DMPC in stable vesicular complexes, and in a 100:1 DMPC/apo A-I (mol/mol) mixture which gives micellar complexes at equilibrium. Gel filtration and fluorescence methods (polarization and intensity) were used to follow the reaction kinetics. The binding of apo A-I to DMPC vesicles is a very rapid process which takes only a few minutes, while the formation of micellar complexes takes several hours at 25 degrees C and involves saturated complexes of apo A-I . DMPC and free apo A-I. The rate-limiting step in micellar complex formation is the breakdown of saturated vesicle . apo A-I complexes, a process that exhibits first order kinetics with a rate constant k = 0.22 h-1 and a half-life t 1/2 = 3 h 9 min."
https://openalex.org/W1503890305,"Both adenylate cyclase and GTPase activities in human mononuclear cell membranes were increased by prostaglandins. Adenylate cyclase activity, however, was enhanced by much lower concentrations of PGE1 (prostaglandin E1) than were required to increase GTPase. PGE2, PGA1, PGB1, and PGF1 alpha also stimulated GTPase activity. These same prostaglandins, with the notable exception of PGF1 alpha, increased adenylate cyclase activity (PGE2 greater than PGA1 greater than or equal to PGB1). Isoproterenol, 100 microM, doubled adenylate cyclase without altering GTPase activity. Choleragen activated adenylate cyclase in mononuclear cell membranes but had no effect on GTPase activity whether or not PGE1 was present. Mononuclear cells were separated into adherent and nonadherent populations by two different methods to examine the possibility that the prostaglandin-stimulated GTPase was confined to a specific type of mononuclear cell. Adenylate cyclase in membranes from both adherent and nonadherent cells was activated by PGE1, but neither PGE1 nor choleragen altered GTPase activity in these preparations. It appears that, although several prostaglandins can increase GTPase activity in mononuclear cell membranes, the increase in GTPase activity is not consistently associated with activation of adenylate cyclase by prostaglandins."

https://openalex.org/W1535228197,"Nearest neighbor frequencies in initiator RNA (iRNA) of a human lymphocyte cell line have been measured in isolated nuclei under conditions where ribonucleotides have been omitted from the incubation. Deoxynucleotides are incorporated in iRNA to a limited extent for the omitted cognate ribonucleotide. In addition, upon omission of a ribonucleotide, changes in the nearest neighbor frequencies also occur indicating base substitution of another ribonucleotide. The base substitutions that have been observed are the incorporation of rA for rG or rU. Substitution for rA has not been observed. When rC is omitted, a change in all nearest neighbor frequencies occurs, suggesting possibly an unusual role for rC. The substitutions demonstrate the unique features of iRNA synthesis and point out possible alterations in iRNA that may occur in vivo when nucleotide pools are altered."

https://openalex.org/W1602379659,"Abstract The properties of the general acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase from pig liver and the stable reduced dehydrogenase . product and oxidized dehydrogenase . acetoacetyl-CoA complexes of the dehydrogenase were investigated. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 178,000 to 183,000 determined by gel filtration chromatography and by gel electrophoresis at different acrylamide concentrations. The subunit molecular weight is 45,000 based on acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dodecyl sulfate which agrees with the minimum molecular weight calculated from the flavin:protein ratio and the amino acid analysis. The subunits are identical, or very similar, as judged by quantitative NH2-terminal analysis and mapping of tryptic peptides. Immunochemical analyses by the complement fixation technique show that the structure of the oxidized enzyme is different from the structure of enzyme . acyl-CoA complexes whether the flavin in these complexes is in the oxidized or reduced state. The amino acid analysis, isoelectric point, and a procedure for crystallizing the dehydrogenase are also reported."

https://openalex.org/W1576449671,"A method for the kinetic determination of peptide exchange using stable isotope enrichment is described. Synthetic 90% enriched (epsilon-13C)His 12 ribonuclease (RNase) (1-15) peptide was used as a probe to follow peptide exchange in the RNase S system by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The rate constant, k1, for dissociation of the RNase S complex containing the synthetic (1-15) peptide was found to be (4.1 +/- 0.3) x 10(-4) s-1 and its dissociation constant Kd, (0.2 +/- 0.8) x 10(-7) M, was greater than that of RNase S with natural S-peptide (residues 1 to 20) by a factor of five at 4 degrees C. This differences corresponds to the difference of the enthalpy of binding between the (1-15) and (1-20) peptides, which we determined to be 1.7 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol. This small enthalpy difference may originate from hydrogen bonding between Ser 16 and His 48 in the RNase S complex."
