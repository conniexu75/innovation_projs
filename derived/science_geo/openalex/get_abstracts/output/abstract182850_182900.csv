https://openalex.org/W2130417276,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) modulates hippocampal plasticity and hippocampal-dependent memory in cell models and in animals. We examined the effects of a valine (val) to methionine (met) substitution in the 5' pro-region of the human BDNF protein. In human subjects, the met allele was associated with poorer episodic memory, abnormal hippocampal activation assayed with fMRI, and lower hippocampal n-acetyl aspartate (NAA), assayed with MRI spectroscopy. Neurons transfected with met-BDNF-GFP showed lower depolarization-induced secretion, while constitutive secretion was unchanged. Furthermore, met-BDNF-GFP failed to localize to secretory granules or synapses. These results demonstrate a role for BDNF and its val/met polymorphism in human memory and hippocampal function and suggest val/met exerts these effects by impacting intracellular trafficking and activity-dependent secretion of BDNF."
https://openalex.org/W2060162734,"Exchange factors for ARF GTPases (ARF-GEFs) regulate vesicle trafficking in a variety of organisms. The Arabidopsis protein GNOM is a brefeldin A (BFA) sensitive ARF-GEF that is required for the proper polar localization of PIN1, a candidate transporter of the plant hormone auxin. Mutations in GNOM lead to developmental defects that resemble those caused by interfering with auxin transport. Both PIN1 localization and auxin transport are also sensitive to BFA. In this paper, we show that GNOM localizes to endosomes and is required for their structural integrity. We engineered a BFA-resistant version of GNOM. In plants harboring this fully functional GNOM variant, PIN1 localization and auxin transport are no longer sensitive to BFA, while trafficking of other proteins is still affected by the drug. Our results demonstrate that GNOM is required for the recycling of auxin transport components and suggest that ARF-GEFs regulate specific endosomal trafficking pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2127187175,"An understanding of the logic of odor perception requires a functional analysis of odor-evoked patterns of activity in neural assemblies in the brain. We have developed a sensitive imaging system in the Drosophila brain that couples two-photon microscopy with the specific expression of the calcium-sensitive fluorescent protein, G-CaMP. At natural odor concentration, each odor elicits a distinct and sparse spatial pattern of activity in the antennal lobe that is conserved in different flies. Patterns of glomerular activity are similar upon imaging of sensory and projection neurons, suggesting the faithful transmission of sensory input to higher brain centers. Finally, we demonstrate that the response pattern of a given glomerulus is a function of the specificity of a single odorant receptor. The development of this imaging system affords an opportunity to monitor activity in defined neurons throughout the fly brain with high sensitivity and excellent spatial resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1981849277,"Cell cycle progression depends on precise elimination of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors by the ubiquitin system. Elimination of the CDK inhibitor Sic1 by the SCFCdc4 ubiquitin ligase at the onset of S phase requires phosphorylation of Sic1 on at least six of its nine Cdc4-phosphodegron (CPD) sites. A 2.7 A X-ray crystal structure of a Skp1-Cdc4 complex bound to a high-affinity CPD phosphopeptide from human cyclin E reveals a core CPD motif, Leu-Leu-pThr-Pro, bound to an eight-bladed WD40 propeller domain in Cdc4. The low affinity of each CPD motif in Sic1 reflects structural discordance with one or more elements of the Cdc4 binding site. Reengineering of Cdc4 to reduce selection against Sic1 sequences allows ubiquitination of lower phosphorylated forms of Sic1. These features account for the observed phosphorylation threshold in Sic1 recognition and suggest an equilibrium binding mode between a single receptor site in Cdc4 and multiple low-affinity CPD sites in Sic1."
https://openalex.org/W2104538433,"X-ray structures of the basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLHZ) domains of Myc-Max and Mad-Max heterodimers bound to their common DNA target (Enhancer or E box hexanucleotide, 5'-CACGTG-3') have been determined at 1.9 A and 2.0 A resolution, respectively. E box recognition by these two structurally similar transcription factor pairs determines whether a cell will divide and proliferate (Myc-Max) or differentiate and become quiescent (Mad-Max). Deregulation of Myc has been implicated in the development of many human cancers, including Burkitt's lymphoma, neuroblastomas, and small cell lung cancers. Both quasisymmetric heterodimers resemble the symmetric Max homodimer, albeit with marked structural differences in the coiled-coil leucine zipper regions that explain preferential homo- and heteromeric dimerization of these three evolutionarily related DNA-binding proteins. The Myc-Max heterodimer, but not its Mad-Max counterpart, dimerizes to form a bivalent heterotetramer, which explains how Myc can upregulate expression of genes with promoters bearing widely separated E boxes."
https://openalex.org/W2170915150,"The transcription factor c-Jun mediates several cellular processes, including proliferation and survival, and is upregulated in many carcinomas. Liver-specific inactivation of c-Jun at different stages of tumor development was used to study its role in chemically induced hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in mice. The requirement for c-jun was restricted to early stages of tumor development, and the number and size of hepatic tumors was dramatically reduced when c-jun was inactivated after the tumor had initiated. The impaired tumor development correlated with increased levels of p53 and its target gene noxa, resulting in the induction of apoptosis without affecting cell proliferation. Primary hepatocytes lacking c-Jun showed increased sensitivity to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, which was abrogated in the absence of p53. These data indicate that c-Jun prevents apoptosis by antagonizing p53 activity, illustrating a mechanism that might contribute to the early stages of human HCC development."
https://openalex.org/W2142872318,"During Drosophila embryogenesis, the dorsal transcription factor activates the expression of twist, a transcription factor required for mesoderm formation. We show here that the mammalian twist proteins, twist-1 and -2, are induced by a cytokine signaling pathway that requires the dorsal-related protein RelA, a member of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors. Twist-1 and -2 repress cytokine gene expression through interaction with RelA. Mice homozygous for a twist-2 null allele or doubly heterozygous for twist-1 and -2 alleles show elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in perinatal death from cachexia. These findings reveal an evolutionarily conserved signaling circuit in which twist proteins regulate cytokine signaling by establishing a negative feedback loop that represses the NF-kappaB-dependent cytokine pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2168586962,"The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is essential for the replication of viral RNA and thus constitutes a valid target for the chemotherapeutic intervention of HCV infection. In this report, we describe the identification of 2'-substituted nucleosides as inhibitors of HCV replication. The 5'-triphosphates of 2'-C-methyladenosine and 2'-O-methylcytidine are found to inhibit NS5B-catalyzed RNA synthesis in vitro, in a manner that is competitive with substrate nucleoside triphosphate. NS5B is able to incorporate either nucleotide analog into RNA as determined with gel-based incorporation assays but is impaired in its ability to extend the incorporated analog by addition of the next nucleotide. In a subgenomic replicon cell line, 2-C-methyladenosine and 2'-O-methylcytidine inhibit HCV RNA replication. The 5'-triphosphates of both nucleosides are detected intracellularly following addition of the nucleosides to the media. However, significantly higher concentrations of 2'-C-methyladenosine triphosphate than 2'-O-methylcytidine triphosphate are detected, consistent with the greater potency of 2'-C-methyladenosine in the replicon assay, despite similar inhibition of NS5B by the triphosphates in the in vitro enzyme assays. Thus, the 2'-modifications of natural substrate nucleosides transform these molecules into potent inhibitors of HCV replication."
https://openalex.org/W2092933011,"Neurogenesis, or the production of new neurons, is regulated by physiological and pathological processes including aging, stress, and brain injury. Many mitogenic and trophic factors that regulate proliferation of nonneuronal cells are also involved in neurogenesis. These include vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), which stimulates the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into neuronal precursor cells in vitro and in the adult rat brain in vivo. Using BrdU labeling as an index of cell proliferation, we found that the in vitro neuroproliferative effect of VEGF was associated with up-regulation of E2F family transcription factors, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cdc25. VEGF also increased nuclear expression of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3, consistent with regulation of the G1/S phase transition of the cell cycle. The proliferative effect of VEGF was inhibited by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059, the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GF102390X, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin, indicating involvement of multiple signaling pathways. These findings help to provide a molecular basis for some of the recently identified neuronal effects of VEGF."
https://openalex.org/W1976785965,"Axonal selection of synaptic partners is generally believed to determine wiring specificity in the nervous system. However, we have recently found evidence for specific dendritic targeting in the olfactory system of Drosophila: second order olfactory neurons (Projection Neurons) from the anterodorsal (adPN) and lateral (lPN) lineages send their dendrites to stereotypical, intercalating but non-overlapping glomeruli. Here we show that POU domain transcription factors, Acj6 and Drifter, are expressed in adPNs and lPNs respectively, and are required for their dendritic targeting. Moreover, misexpression of Acj6 in lPNs, or Drifter in adPNs, results in dendritic targeting to glomeruli normally reserved for the other PN lineage. Thus, Acj6 and Drifter translate PN lineage information into distinct dendritic targeting specificity. Acj6 also controls stereotypical axon terminal arborization of PNs in a central target, suggesting that the connectivity of PN axons and dendrites in different brain centers is coordinately regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1983507078,"Ancient traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has effectively relied on the theory of yin-yang balance in diagnoses and treatments of diseases and disorders for more than 2000 years. However, in eastern society, yin-yang is regarded as an incomprehensible ideology without definite physical meaning. Consequently, the yin-yang balance in medicine has not been studied by modern scientific means. In the western world, yin-yang balance is often misunderstood as a religious belief or a principle of lifestyle. Herein, we attempted to define the physical meaning of yin-yang in TCM by correlating it with biochemical processes. We propose that yin-yang balance is antioxidation-oxidation balance with yin representing antioxidation and yang as oxidation. Our proposal is partially supported by the fact that the yin-tonic traditional Chinese herbs have, on average, about six times more antioxidant activity and polyphenolic contents than the yang-tonic herbs. Our hypothesis opens an avenue to systematically study the yin-yang balance and its health implications with the use of modern biochemical tools."
https://openalex.org/W2019105280,"Alternative splicing induces, under abnormal cholinergic neurotransmission, overproduction of the rare ""readthrough"" acetylcholinesterase variant AChE-R. We explored the pathophysiological relevance of this phenomenon in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and rats with experimental autoimmune MG (EAMG), neuromuscular junction diseases with depleted acetylcholine receptors. In MG and EAMG, we detected serum AChE-R accumulation. In EAMG, we alleviated electromyographic abnormalities by nanomolar doses of EN101, an antisense oligonucleotide that selectively lowers AChE-R in blood and muscle yet leaves unaffected the synaptic variant AChE-S. Whereas animals treated with placebo or conventional anticholinesterases continued to deteriorate, a 4 wk daily oral administration of EN101 improved survival, neuromuscular strength and clinical status in moribund EAMG rats. The efficacy of targeting only one AChE splicing variant highlights potential advantages of mRNA-targeted therapeutics for chronic cholinergic malfunctioning."
https://openalex.org/W2063742002,"The formation of new blood vessels is a critical determinant of tumor progression. We find that Par1 gene expression plays a central role in blood vessel recruitment in animal models. By in vivo injection of either Matrigel plugs containing Par1-expressing cells or of rat prostatic carcinoma cells transfected with tetracycline-inducible Par1 expression vectors, we show that Par1 significantly enhances both angiogenesis and tumor growth. Several vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) splice forms are induced in cells expressing Par1. Activation of PAR1 markedly augments the expression of VEGF mRNAs and of functional VEGFs as determined by in vitro assays for endothelial tube alignment and bovine aortic endothelial cell proliferation. Because neutralizing anti-VEGF antibodies potently inhibited Par1-induced endothelial cell proliferation, we conclude that Par1-induced angiogenesis requires VEGF. Specific inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), Src, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibit Par1-induced VEGF expression, suggesting the participation of these kinases in the process. We also show that oncogenic transformation by genes known to be part of PAR1 signaling machinery is sufficient to increase VEGF expression in NIH 3T3 cells. These data support the novel notion that initiation of cell signaling either by activating PAR1 or by the activated forms of oncogenes is sufficient to induce VEGF and hence angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2067406500,"Among the pathways for protein translocation across biological membranes, the DeltapH-dependent/Tat system is unusual in its sole reliance upon the transmembrane pH gradient to drive protein transport. The free energy cost of protein translocation via the chloro-plast DeltapH-dependent/Tat pathway was measured by conducting in vitro transport assays with isolated thylakoids while concurrently monitoring energetic parameters. These experiments revealed a substrate-specific energetic barrier to cpTat-mediated transport as well as direct utilization of protons from the gradient, consistent with a H+/protein antiporter mechanism. The magnitude of proton flux was assayed by four independent approaches and averaged 7.9 x 10(4) protons released from the gradient per transported protein. This corresponds to a DeltaG transport of 6.9 x 10(5) kJ.mol protein translocated(-1), representing the utilization of an energetic equivalent of 10(4) molecules of ATP. At this cost, we estimate that the DeltapH-dependent/cpTat pathway utilizes approximately 3% of the total energy output of the chloroplast."
https://openalex.org/W2100751336,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lysophospholipid mediator that acts through G protein-coupled receptors. Most cell lines in culture express one or more LPA receptors, making it difficult to assign a response to specific LPA receptors. Dissection of the signaling properties of LPA has been hampered by lack of LPA receptor subtype-specific agonists and antagonists. The present study characterizes an ester-linked thiophosphate derivative (1-oleoyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycerophosphothionate, OMPT) of LPA. OMPT is a functional LPA analogue with potent mitogenic activity in fibroblasts. In contrast to LPA, OMPT does not couple to the pheromone response through the LPA1 receptor in yeast cells. OMPT induces intracellular calcium increases efficiently in LPA3 receptor-expressing Sf9 cells but poorly in LPA2 receptor-expressing cells. Guanosine 5′-O-(3-[35S]thio)triphosphate binding assays in mammalian cells showed that LPA exhibits agonistic activity on all three LPA receptor subtypes, whereas OMPT has a potent agonistic effect only on the LPA3 receptor. In transiently transfected HEK293 cells, OMPT stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinases through the LPA3 but not the LPA1 or LPA2receptors. Furthermore, OMPT-induced intracellular calcium mobilization in mammalian cells is efficiently inhibited by the LPA1/LPA3 receptor-selective antagonist VPC12249. These results establish that OMPT is an LPA3-selective agonist.

LPA binds and activates G protein-coupled receptors of the endothelial cell differentiation gene (Edg) family (15Fukushima N. Chun J. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 21-32Google Scholar).

Several groups have studied the structure-activity relationship of LPA to gain a better understanding of the function of particular receptors in the mammalian system and to define the mechanism by which LPA binds to and activates its cognate receptors. Several conclusions can be drawn from these studies, including a strong requirement for a free phosphate (3van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H.

In an effort to create LPA analogues with improved potency and/or receptor selectivity, we characterized an LPA analogue, 1-oleoyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphothionate (OMPT). Previous studies of structure-function relationship of LPA analogues have proven difficult to interpret in complex mammalian systems where more than one LPA receptor is present on the cell surface. However, G protein-coupled receptors can be expressed in eukaryotic cell models such as yeast (30Erickson J.R. Wu J.J. Goddard J.G. Tigyi G. Kawanishi K. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27776-27785Google Scholar) to study a receptor in an isolated context and without an endogenous LPA response. By virtue of these approaches combined with assays in mammalian cells such as guanosine 5′-O-(3-[35S]thio)triphosphate (GTP[γ-35S]) binding assay (31Heise C.E. Santos W.L. Schreihofer A.M. Heasley B.H. Mukhin Y.V. Macdonald T.L. Lynch K.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1173-1180Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that OMPT, at low concentrations (≤100 nm), triggers cellular responses through the LPA3 but not the LPA1 or LPA2 receptors. At least 10-fold higher concentrations of OMPT are required to activate the LPA2receptor. OMPT does not exhibit agonistic effects on the LPA1 receptor at concentrations of 1 ॖm or higher. In mammalian cells, OMPT coupling to the LPA3receptor is sufficient to evoke activation of G proteins, calcium mobilization, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Thus OMPT offers a powerful probe for the dissection of LPA signaling events in complex mammalian systems. LPA (18:1) and S1P were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and Calbiochem, respectively. Indo-1-AM was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and monoclonal antibodies against FLAG M2 and ॆ-actin were purchased from Sigma. Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. The antibody against active, phosphorylated Erk was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-HA monoclonal antibody and anti-Erk polyclonal antibody were from Babco (Berkeley, CA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. GTP[γ-35S] (1200 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. OMPT was synthesized at Oxford Asymmetry (Oxford, UK) under contract with LXR Biotechnology, Inc. Full details of the chemical synthesis are available on request. Briefly, starting with 1-O-benzyl-glycerol, the primary alcohol was converted to a silyl ether, followed by standard methylation of the secondary alcohol to yield a 2-methoxy substituent. The resulting compound was subjected to hydrogenation to cleave the benzyl ether yielding an alcohol that was then acylated using oleoyl chloride. After cleavage of the silyl group with fluoride, the revealed alcohol was reacted with phosphoramidite followed by elemental sulfur. Finally, the isopropyl deprotecting groups were removed to afford the racemic thiophosphonate compound, which was purified chromatographically. The purity of OMPT was nearly 1007 as analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Swiss 3T3, C3H10T1/2, and HEK293 were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collections (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The ovarian cancer cell line A2780CP was kindly provided by T. C.

HEK293T cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 107 FBS. PC-3M cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 107 charcoal and dextran-stripped FBS (HyClone). Swiss 3T3 and HEK293 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 FBS. C3H10T1/2 was cultured in Basal Eagle's medium containing 107 FBS. A2780CP was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 107 FBS. These mammalian cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 57 CO2. The insect cell line Sf9 from Invitrogen was cultured in Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen) containing 107 FBS at 27 °C. All cell lines were frozen at early passages and used for less than 10 weeks in continuous culture. Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer or ice-cold X-100 lysis buffer (17 Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 107 glycerol, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protein inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Total cellular protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon (poly(vinylidene difluoride)), and immunoblotted with antibodies following the protocols provided by manufacturers. Immunocomplexes were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from cell lines using the FastTrack 2.0 mRNA Isolation kit following the instructions of the supplier (Invitrogen). Northern blotting analyses (4 ॖg of poly(A)+ RNA for loading) were performed as described previously (32Fang X. Gibson S. Flowers M. Furui T. Bast Jr., R.C. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13683-13689Google Scholar). The human LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 cDNA were isolated from expression vectors, labeled with [32P]dCTP, and used as probes for hybridization. After starvation in serum-free medium for 12–24 h, C3H10T1/2 cells were harvested and loaded with 1 ॖm Indo-1 AM in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in a [Ca2+]i assay buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 25 mm Hepes, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4). Cytoplasmic [Ca2+]i was determined at an excitation wavelength of 331 nm and an emission wavelength of 410 nm using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4000, Hitachi). Approximately 3 × 106 cells were used for [Ca2+]idetermination in a stirred quartz cuvette kept at 37 °C. PC-3M cells were plated onto opaque, 96-well clear bottom plates at about 807 of confluence. The next day, cells were washed with Hanks' Basal Salts Solution containing 0.17 fatty acid-free BSA and loaded in the same solution with the calcium-sensing dye, Fluo-4AM. Calcium signals were recorded using a fast kinetic fluorometer (FLEXStation, Molecular Devices, Inc.). Excitation was at 485 nm, and records were collected at 525 nm. For the cytoplasmic [Ca2+]i assay in Sf9, ∼2 × 106 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus engineered to express the LPA2, LPA3, or LPA1/LPA2 chimeric receptor (19Bandoh K. Aoki J. Hosono H.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 159-165Google Scholar). The preparations of the virus and infection of Sf9 cells have been described previously (19Bandoh K. Aoki J. Hosono H. Kobayashi S. Kobayashi T. Murakami-Murofushi K. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27776-27785Google Scholar). Two days after virus infection, cells were starved and harvested for cytoplasmic [Ca2+]i assays. After cells were loaded with 1 ॖm Indo-1 AM in PBS for 30 min at 27 °C, cytoplasmic [Ca2+]i was determined at 27 °C in the same [Ca2+]i assay buffer as described above for C3H10T1/2 cells. The JEY5yeast cells transformed with LPA1 orS1P1/Edg1 was grown in SC media containing 27 galactose lacking uracil to an approximate OD of 0.1 prior to the addition of lipids as described previously (30Erickson J.R. Wu J.J. Goddard J.G. Tigyi G. Kawanishi K. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1506-1510Google Scholar). LPA and OMPT were stored in chloroform or methanol and dried down under vacuum immediately prior to experiments. Dried LPA and OMPT were resuspended at 20 mm in a solution containing 50 mmNH4HCO3, 104 mm NaCl, 250 ॖm EDTA, pH 7.6, with sonication until the solution was clear. Cells were grown for 7 h in the presence of lipid agonists, and then 100 ॖl of yeast culture was mixed with 900 ॖl of assay buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0, 2.7 ml of ॆ-mercaptoethanol per liter) plus 50 ॖl of 0.17 SDS and 3 drops of chloroform. Cells were vortexed for 10 s and incubated for 5 min at 28 °C.O-Nitrophenol-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG, Sigma) (200 ॖl of 4 mg/ml) was added to allow a 30-min reaction at 28 °C. The assay was stopped by adding 500 ॖl of 1 mNa2CO3. Color development was measured atA420 and normalized toA600. Units were expressed as Miller units (30Erickson J.R. Wu J.J. Goddard J.G. Tigyi G. Kawanishi K. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1506-1510Google Scholar). The GTP[γ-35S] assay was performed as described previously (31Heise C.E. Santos W.L. Schreihofer A.M. Heasley B.H. Mukhin Y.V. Macdonald T.L. Lynch K.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1173-1180Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were co-transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with expression vectors encoding one of the receptors for LPA (LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3) or S1P (S1P3/Edg3) and plasmids encoding three G proteins (rat Gi2α, cow ॆ1, and cow γ2). After 48 h, cells were harvested and crude microsomal membranes prepared. Membranes containing 5 ॖg of protein were incubated in 0.1 ml of GTP-binding buffer (50 mmHepes, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) containing 5 ॖg of saponin, 0.17 fatty acid-free BSA, 10 ॖm GDP, 0.1 nm GTP[γ-35S] (1200 Ci/mmol), and indicated concentrations of LPA or OMPT for 30 min at 30 °C. Membranes were collected using a 96-well Brandel Cell Harvester (Gaithersburg, MD), and bound radionuclide was determined using a Packard TopCount liquid scintillation counter. The LPA1 receptor expression vector, pcDNA3-FLAG-LPA1, was provided by Dr. W. H. Moolenaar (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The LPA2 andLPA3 cDNAs were obtained from OVCAR-3 by reverse transcriptase-PCR and inserted into pcDNA3 that had been pre-modified to contain the FLAG M2 DNA sequence. The structures of pcDNA-FLAG-LPA1, pcDNA3FLAG-LPA2, and pcDNA3FLAG-LPA3 were confirmed by sequencing. The HA-Erk1 expression vector (pCEP4-HA-Erk1) was a gift of Dr. M. Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). HEK293 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 1.5 ॖg of DNA/well using FuGENE 6 according to the protocol of the supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The molar ratio of an Edg expression vector to the HA-Erk1 vector was adjusted to 5:1 to ensure co-expression of Edg receptors with HA-Erk1 as described previously (33Fang X. Yu S. Tanyi J.L. Lu Y. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2099-2110Google Scholar). OMPT was designed and synthesized as part of a screen for Edg receptor-specific agonists. As compared with 18:1 LPA, in OMPT, the hydroxy and the phosphate have been converted to anO-methoxy group and a phosphothionate, respectively (Fig.1). These modifications were designed to prevent metabolism to phosphatidic acid by LPA acyltransferases (2Pages C. Simon M. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 1-10Google Scholar, 34Imai A. Furui T. Tamaya T. Mills G.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 3370-3375Google Scholar) and to evade lipid phosphatases (23Hooks S.B.

To determine whether OMPT exhibits agonistic activities, we first assessed the ability of OMPT to increase intracellular calcium change in mammalian cells, a standard assay for LPA activity. As shown in Fig.2A, both LPA and OMPT were able to trigger [Ca2+]i responses in a dose-dependent manner in C3H10T1/2 cells. However, LPA was more potent than OMPT in this assay. OMPT also induced activation of Erk in C3H10T1/2 cells as revealed by immunoblotting with an Erk phospho-specific antibody (Fig. 2B), demonstrating a generalized ability of OMPT to couple to multiple intracellular signaling cascades. As shown in Fig. 2B, LPA was able to induce significant Erk phosphorylation at 0.01 ॖm,whereas OMPT had weaker effect at this concentration. At higher concentrations tested, OMPT and LPA were equipotent in the induction of Erk phosphorylation. However, compared with LPA, OMPT stimulated more sustained phosphorylation of Erk in C3H10T1/2 cells as shown in Fig.2B.Figure 2OMPT is a functional LPA analogue in mammalian cells. A, OMPT induces intracellular calcium mobilization. C3H10T1/2 cells were grown to subconfluence, starved in serum-free medium, and harvested for cytoplasmic [Ca2+]i assays as detailed under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 B, OMPT stimulates MAPK activation. Serum-starved C3H10T1/2 cells were stimulated for 5 min with LPA or OMPT at the indicated concentrations (upper panel) or were treated with LPA or OMPT (1 ॖm) for the indicated intervals (hour) (lower panel). Phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 was assessed by immunoblotting with a phospho-specific Erk antibody. Immunoblotting for total cellular Erk using phosphorylation-independent Erk antibody was included to show equal loading among samples. C, C3H10T1/2 cells express LPA1 and LPA3 receptor mRNAs. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from C3H10T1/2 and the human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780CP, a control cell line known to express multiple LPA receptors. The expression of Edg LPA receptors was examined by Northern blotting as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Transcripts of the LPA1 and LPA3receptors expressed in C3H10T1/2 cells are marked witharrows. The hamster transcript of the LPA3receptor in C3H10T1/2 cells is different in size from that in the human cell line A2780CP. D, OMPT is a potent mitogen in C3H10T1/2 cells. The mitogenic activity of LPA and OMPT was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 The data represent the means ± S.D. of triplicate assays. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The activation of these signaling processes by LPA and OMPT in C3H10T1/2 cells is likely mediated by specific LPA receptors. The lack of sufficiently sensitive antibodies to detect endogenously expressed Edg LPA receptors has precluded direct analysis of receptor protein expression in mammalian cell lines. We thus examined mRNA expression of the LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 receptors in C3H10T1/2 cells. Northern blot analysis showed the presence of detectable levels of LPA1and LPA3 mRNAs in this cell line (Fig.2C). One of the most prominent cellular effects of LPA is the stimulation of cell proliferation, particularly in fibroblasts (3van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Google Scholar, 38van Corven E.J. van Rijswijk A. Jalink K. van der Bend R.L. van Blitterswijk W.J. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 163-169Google Scholar). To determine whether OMPT retains this activity of LPA, we measured the mitogenic responses to LPA and OMPT by [3H]thymidine incorporation in C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 2D). Consistent with previous studies (3van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Google Scholar, 38van Corven E.J. van Rijswijk A. Jalink K. van der Bend R.L. van Blitterswijk W.J. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 163-169Google Scholar), high concentrations of LPA are required to stimulate cell proliferation. LPA at 1 ॖm induced only minimal DNA synthesis as reflected by limited thymidine incorporation (Fig.2D). A prominent activity was seen only when 10 ॖm or higher concentrations of LPA were administered. Consistent with the more sustained activation of Erk seen in OMPT-treated cells (Fig. 2B), OMPT exhibited much stronger proliferative activity than LPA (Fig. 2D). The compound stimulated DNA synthesis at ∼100-fold lower concentrations than LPA (Fig. 2D). Detectable levels of DNA synthesis were observed as low as 0.01 ॖm OMPT. The optimal stimulatory activity of OMPT occurred at 1 ॖm with higher concentrations of OMPT (10 and 20 ॖm) showing lower activity. Therefore, OMPT constitutes a novel LPA analogue exhibiting potent mitogenic activity at submicromolar concentrations. This greatly enhanced mitogenic activity probably reflects an improved stability, efficacy, and/or receptor selectivity of OMPT. As demonstrated previously, LPA1 can couple to the endogenous yeast heterotrimeric G proteins and activate the pheromone response pathway resulting in activation of a FUS1 promoter fused to the lacZ gene (FUS1::lacZ) stably integrated into the yeast genome as a reporter (30Erickson J.R. Wu J.J. Goddard J.G. Tigyi G. Kawanishi K. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1506-1510Google Scholar). To determine the receptor specificity of OMPT compared with LPA, we employed this system to ask whether OMPT can activate the LPA1 receptor in yeast. As seen in Fig.3, LPA induced activation of thelacZ reporter in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, OMPT did not stimulate the pheromone response as indicated by lack of an increase in lacZ activity, suggesting that OMPT is unable to activate LPA1, at least in the yeast system. With increasing concentrations, OMPT slightly decreases basal levels oflacZ activity (Fig. 3). In untransformed yeast cells (data not shown) or cells transformed to express an S1P receptor (S1P1/Edg1), neither LPA nor OMPT stimulated any significant increase in lacZ activity (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the structural alterations in OMPT lead to loss of the capability to interact functionally with the LPA1receptor. Although LPA1 couples efficiently to the yeast pheromone response, LPA2 works poorly, and LPA3does not function in this system (28Erickson J.R. Espinal G. Mills G.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 279-281Google Scholar), precluding the use of the yeast model to study the ligand specificity of LPA receptors other than the LPA1 receptor. To assess the ability of OMPT to activate the LPA2 and LPA3 receptors, we used the Sf9/baculovirus expression system with calcium mobilization as an indicator of receptor activation. Parental Sf9 does not respond to exogenous LPA (39Aoki J. Bandoh K. Inoue K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 263-266Google Scholar), making it an ideal system for analyzing functions of specific LPA receptors. As described previously, the LPA2 and LPA3 receptors, but not the LPA1 receptor, couple to cytosolic calcium changes in Sf9 cells (39Aoki J. Bandoh K. Inoue K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 263-266Google Scholar). After infection with recombinant baculovirus expressing LPA2 or LPA3, Sf9 cells were assessed for LPA- and OMPT-induced calcium mobilization. LPA efficiently elevated intracellular [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner in Sf9 cells expressing either the LPA2 or LPA3 receptor (Fig. 4). The threshold concentrations of LPA required to induce detectable [Ca2+]iincrease in the LPA2 and LPA3receptor-expressing cells were ∼0.1 and 10 nm, respectively. EC50 values were 0.84 nm for the LPA2 receptor-exp"

Vacuolation by endothelial cells and lumen formation, the earliest detectable stages of angiogenesis, were inhibited by the ROK inhibitor Wf-536. Combining Wf-536 with the MMP inhibitor Marimastat greatly enhanced in vitro inhibition of endothelial vacuolation, lumen and cord formation, and VEGF- and HGF-stimulated endothelial sprout formation from aorta. Inhibition of sprout formation by the two inhibitors was synergistic. Both agents inhibited migration of HUVECs. The regulatory subunit (MYPT1) of the myosin phosphatase was phosphorylated in PC3 cells and HUVECs, and phosphorylation of MYPT1 and the myosin regulatory light chain was reduced by Wf-536, providing direct evidence of ROK activity. Early treatment of immuno-incompetent mice bearing xenotransplants of PC3 cells with a combination of Wf-536 plus Marimastat with or without Paclitaxel, significantly inhibited tumor growth, prevented tumor growth escape after discontinuation of Paclitaxel, and increased survival."
https://openalex.org/W2116234391,"A disulfide cross-linking strategy was used to covalently trap as a stable complex (complex N) a short-lived, kinetic intermediate in DNA polymerization.

The cross-linking method that we used is a variation of a technique developed by the Verdine and Harrison laboratories. It involves disulfide interchange between an engineered sulfhydryl group of the protein (Q258C mutation) and a disulfide-containing tether attached at the N 2amino group of a modified dG in either the template or the primer strand of the nucleic acid. We report here a highly efficient synthesis of the precursor, bis(3-aminopropyl)disulfide dihydrochloride, used to introduce this substituent into the oligonucleotide. Efficient cross-linking takes place when the base pair containing the substituent is positioned seven registers from the dNTP-binding site (N site) and the N site is occupied.

It is a heterodimer composed of a larger 560-residue subunit (p66) and a smaller subunit (p51) that contains the N-terminal 440 residues of p66. Both subunits contain subdomains that were named fingers, palm, thumb, and connection, because of the similarity of p66 to a right hand. The DNA polymerase active site is located in the p66 palm subdomain and the DNA binding cleft is formed primarily by the p66 fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains. The mechanism of polymerization by RT is similar to other polymerases and involves: 1) binding of the DNA substrate to the apo-enzyme; 2) binding of dNTP and divalent metal ions (required for catalysis) to the enzyme·DNA complex, followed by rate-limiting conformational changes; 3) formation of a phosphodiester bond between the 3′-OH primer terminus and the α-phosphate of dNTP, followed by release of the pyrophosphate product; 4) translocation of the elongated DNA primer (for processive synthesis) from the dNTP-binding site (N site) to the priming site (P site) or release of the nucleic acid (distributive synthesis) (Fig.1). Extensive biochemical and crystallographic studies have enhanced our understanding of the details of the mechanism of DNA polymerization. However, the translocation step remains a poorly characterized step in DNA synthesis. This is primarily because there is limited biochemical and structural information on the pre-translocation intermediate that exists only transiently and is kinetically undetectable. We present here a method that makes it possible to trap, purify, and crystallize this short-lived intermediate. The method is based on the cross-linking technique that the Harrison and Verdine laboratories used to obtain a stable covalent complex between RT, DNA, and dNTP. We have modified the protocol to extend/chain-terminate the template-primer with AZTMP. The nucleic acid is covalently trapped with the primer positioned at the N site (1Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). The covalent trapping prevents the primer from translocating to the P site. Covalent linking of the protein to DNA occurs by disulfide interchange between an engineered sulfhydryl group of the protein (Q258C mutation) and a disulfide-containing tether attached at the N 2 amino group of a modified dG in the primer strand of the nucleic acid.

We have used this cross-linking strategy to probe the mechanism of nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance, which is based on enhanced excision.

Using the covalently trapped RT(P)·AZTMP and RT(N)·AZTMP complexes with the AZTMP primer terminus trapped at the P site or at the N site, we show that excision can occur only when the primer is positioned at the N site and not at the P site. 2The terms RT(P) and RT(N) are used to describe complexes of RT with double-stranded DNA with the 3′-end of the primer positioned at the P, or N site respectively. When the primer is terminated by an NRTI, the name of the NRTI monophosphate is added at the end of the name of the complex. For example, the complex RT(N)·AZTMP is a complex with an AZTMP-terminated primer at the N site. Also, the complex RT(ter)-ddN·dTTP is a ternary complex of RT with a ddNMP-terminated primer at the P site and dTTP as the incoming dNTP positioned at the N site. We also show that the product of ATP-based excision of AZTMP from RT(N)·AZTMP is a dinucleoside tetraphosphate. We present preparation and purification protocols that can be used to prepare dinucleoside tetraphosphates of various composition that could be used to probe the mechanism of ATP-based excision. Finally, we established protocols for preparation, purification, and crystallization of the stable RT(P)·AZTMP and RT(N)·AZTMP complexes. Comparison of these crystal structures, which are published elsewhere (24Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Das K. Tuske S. Birktoft J.J. Ilankumaran P. Ramesha A.R. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Boyer P.L.

Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (1.1 g, 4.1 mmol) from Aldrich Chemical Co. was added to a solution of benzyltriethylammonium chloride (2.1 g, 8.9 mmol) in acetonitrile (15 ml), and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The above mesylate (1 g, 4 mmol in 5 ml of acetonitrile) was added to the resultant red solution, and the mixture was stirred for 18 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated to ∼50% of its original volume. Ethyl acetate (25 ml) was added to the dark mass, and the resultant slurry was filtered through Celite. Acetonitrile (5 ml) was added (to dissolve partly the remaining black residue in the flask), followed by ethyl acetate (25 ml), and the resultant slurry was filtered through the same Celite bed. Extraction of the solids was repeated as before, and the combined extracts were concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was re-dissolved in ethyl acetate (100 ml), and the solution was washed with water to remove residual benzyltriethylammonium chloride.

A support-bound 27-mer oligonucleotide (precursor of *27-Tem-C2 and -C3, Table I) containing anO 6-(2-p-nitrophenethyl)-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyinosine residue at the eleventh position from the 5′-end was allowed to react as described previously (13Peletskaya E.N.

Oligonucleotides were purified by HPLC on a Hamilton PRP-1 column (7 μm, 10 × 250 mm) eluted at room temperature (3 ml/min) with a linear gradient that increased the concentration of acetonitrile in 0.1m (NH4)2CO3 buffer (pH 7.5) from 0% to 17.5% over 20 min: t R values, 16.2 min (*27-Tem-C2) and 16.8 min (*27-Tem-C3). HPLC of the purified material (Phenomenex Luna C18 column, 4.6 × 250 mm, eluted at 50 °C (1.5 ml/min) with a linear gradient that increased the concentration of acetonitrile in the above carbonate buffer from 5% to 11% over 20 min): *27-Tem-C2, t R 14 min; *27-Tem-C3, t R 16.6 min.

Initially, coupling of bis(3-aminopropyl)disulfide (3-carbon tether) with the 20-mer oligonucleotide containing anO 6-(trimethylsilylethyl)-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyinosine residue at the fifth position from the 3′-end (precursor of *20-Pri-C3, Table I) was carried out in solution (15DeCorte B.L. Tsarouhtsis D. Kuchimanchi S. Cooper M.D. Horton P. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as follows. The fluorinated 20-mer oligonucleotide was cleaved from the support with 0.1m NaOH, and the resultant solution was neutralized with dilute acetic acid, evaporated to dryness, redissolved in H2O containing 0.2 mbis(3-aminopropyl)disulfide dihydrochloride and 0.75 mEt3N, and allowed to react at room temperature for 3 days. At the end of this time, residual protecting groups were removed by heating at 60 °C for 16 h in a 1:1 ratio of concentrated NH4OH/H2O containing 0.1 mtetrabutylammonium fluoride. Although DeCorte et al. (15DeCorte B.L. Tsarouhtsis D. Kuchimanchi S. Cooper M.D. Horton P. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) had observed more efficient coupling of 2-amino-2-phenylethanol with a fluorinated oligonucleotide after its cleavage from the support with NaOH as above, we subsequently observed that a separate NaOH cleavage step is not necessary with our less-hindered amine, because treatment (3 days at room temperature) of the glass beads with an aqueous solution of 0.9 m bis(3-aminopropyl)disulfide dihydrochloride and 4.5 m Et3N completely cleaves the oligonucleotide from the support concomitantly with replacement of the fluorine. The oligonucleotide, *20-Pri-C3, was purified by HPLC on the Hamilton column as above (t R, 15 min). Although retention times varied depending on the amount of oligonucleotide and diamine injected, the desired oligonucleotide was well separated from multiple minor impurities, most of which eluted either much earlier or much later, as well as from bis(3-aminopropyl)disulfide (t R, 13 min). Thus, preliminary dialysis (13Peletskaya E.N. Boyer P.L. Kogon A.A. Clark P. Kroth H. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9435-9445Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,14Erlanson D.A. Chen L. Verdine G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12583-12584Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) to remove excess bis(3-aminopropyl)disulfide was unnecessary. The isolated yield of purified *20-Pri-C3 was 306A 260 nm (∼1.5 μmol). HPLC of the purified material on a Higgins DNA column (4.6 × 100 mm, Thomson Instrument Co., Clear Brook, VA) eluted at 40 °C (1.5 ml/min) with a linear gradient that increased the concentration of acetonitrile in the carbonate buffer described from 5% to 11% over 20 min, gave a single peak with a t R of 14.9 min. MS (electrospray): calc., 6232; found, 6233. All conventional DNA (non-cross-linkable) oligonucleotides were purchased from the DNA synthesis laboratory at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and were purified by HPLC. Oligonucleotide solutions (0.1 mm) containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7, and 50 mm NaCl were annealed by heating in a water bath for 5 min at 80 °C and allowed to cool slowly to ambient temperatures. The template-primer sequences are shown in Table I. The oligonucleotides are named as follows: The number indicates the length in nucleotides (*20-Pri is a 20-mer primer and *27-Tem is a 27-mer template). The asterisk indicates that the strand contains the modified G and can be cross-linked to the Cys-258. The suffix C3 or C2 on Tem or Pri indicates the length of the aliphatic chain that would link the protein with the enzyme. When we use the oligonucleotide sequence rather than the oligonucleotide name, the linker size is indicated by a subscript on the modified G (ex. G 3 orG 2). Finally, (P)A(N)Tindicates that a dAMP (or an analog of A) and/or a dTMP (or an analog of T) can be positioned at the P and N site, respectively, after cross-linking of the protein to the modified oligonucleotide. All RTs contained the C280S mutation in both p66 and p51 subunits to improve the stability of RT (16Jacobo-Molina A. Clark Jr., A.D. Williams R.L. Nanni R.G. Clark P. Ferris A.L. Hughes S.H.

Virol. 1992; 66: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and minimize nonspecific cross-linking. The WT-1B1 enzyme also contained the Q258C mutation in both subunits. It was prepared by expressing p66 in Escherichia coli and allowing the conversion of p66 to p51 in E. coli extracts. The WT-1B1 enzyme was purified as described previously (18Clark A.D.J. Jacobo-Molina A. Clark P. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The WT-Δ428 construct was prepared by expressing the p66 and p51 subunits from a plasmid that separately encodes p66 and p51. WT-Δ428 had the C terminus of p51 modified. The last HIV-1-encoded amino acid in p51 is 428, followed by two glycines and seven histidines. This allowed purification of RT-containing complexes using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Introduction of the AZT-resistance mutations was performed in the WT-Δ428 construct in a subunit-specific manner as described previously (19Boyer P.L. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Whitmer J. Frank P. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Hence, the AZT21-Δ428 AZT-resistant enzyme contained the C280S mutation in both p66 and p51 subunits, the Q258C mutation in the p66 subunit, and the M41L, D67N, K70R, T215Y, and K219Q mutations in the p66 subunit. The overexpressed WT-Δ428 and AZT21-Δ428 enzymes were purified by metal affinity chromatography. Cross-linking reactions of wild-type and mutant HIV-1 RTs contained 4-fold excess of DNA over enzyme in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2. When needed, 1 mm dNTP and/or 1 mm AZTTP or other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) were added. The reaction was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C and then overnight at room temperature. The results were analyzed on non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Unless otherwise indicated, samples loaded for electrophoresis were not heated, because heating would cause a portion of the uncross-linked strand to separate from the cross-linked protein·DNA complex. Successful cross-linking was assessed by the appearance of a band corresponding to molecular weight of p66 plus DNA with a concomitant disappearance of the band corresponding to p66. The ratio of band intensities corresponding to cross-linked versus uncross-linked p66 subunits, ((p66·DNA)/(p66·DNA + p66)) × 100, was used to calculate the percent yield of the cross-linking reaction. The cross-linked complex was purified using two affinity chromatography procedures combined into one step with the columns connected in tandem. The reaction mixture was loaded onto the immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) column linked to the heparin column. Because RT contains a hexahistidine peptide at the C terminus of p51, both the uncross-linked p66/p51 heterodimer and the cross-linked p66·DNA·p51 complex bound to the IMAC column (first column), whereas the excess of template-primer, nucleotides, NRTIs, and other reaction components flowed through the columns. Application of 100 mm imidazole releases the free and cross-linked proteins from the IMAC column. The free RT bound to the heparin column, whereas the cross-linked RT (p66·DNA·p51) flowed through the heparin column. The peak fractions containing the cross-linked RT p66·DNA·p51 were pooled and concentrated using Millipore Ultrafree 10K spin columns at 4 °C to a final concentration of ∼1 mg/ml. For crystallographic studies the RT p66·DNA·p51 was brought to a final concentration of 10–20 mg/ml. Final p66·DNA·p51 concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and by interpolation from a standard curve of known RT p66·DNA·p51 concentrations. To determine whether the N and P complexes were competent for excision we first prepared AZTMP-blocked covalent complexes of AZT21-Δ428 with DNA that had AZTMP positioned at the P and N sites using the protocol described above. For the covalent complex with AZTMP at the N position (AZT21-Δ428(N)·AZTMP) we used the template-primer 6 (Table I) in the protocol described above with a reaction mixture that contained dATP and AZTTP. For the covalent complex P with AZTMP at the P position (AZT21-Δ428(P)·AZTMP), we used the template-primer 7 (Table I) in the protocol described above with a reaction mixture that contained AZTTP. The cross-linked complexes were purified as described above. Subsequently, the purified N and P complexes were subjected to ATP-based excision. Excision reactions were performed in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mm ATP, 120 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, containing 25 μg of each covalent complex. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The excess of unreacted ATP and any tetraphosphate products of the excision reaction were removed by centrifuging the samples in Millipore Ultrafree 10K spin columns. For the subsequent extension reaction we added [α-32P]dTTP (final concentration 0.1 μm, 1 μCi) in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 8 mm MgCl2, and 120 mm NaCl to the reaction. After incubation for 10 min the concentration of dTTP was adjusted to 2 μm. The reaction was incubated for an additional hour. The products were fractionated on an 11% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography with photographic film. Complex N of AZT-resistant RT (AZT21-Δ428) with an AZTMP-terminated primer (template-primer 6) was prepared as described in the previous paragraph using dGTP and AZTTP for in situprimer extension and blocking. The bulk of the unreacted dGTP and AZTTP was removed by gel filtration through a G-50 column. The flow-through was adjusted to contain 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mm ATP, 120 mm NaCl, 8 mmMgCl2 and allowed to react for at least 4 h at 37 °C. The resulting RT·DNA complex (complex P) was removed by passing the reaction mixture through a nickel-charged IMAC column; the complex can be recovered for further synthesis of a tetraphosphate or other uses. The protein-free flow-through fraction was passed again through a G-50 column to remove most of the unreacted ATP. Final purification of AZTMP-ATP was by HPLC on a Higgins DNA column (10 × 250 mm) at 1 ml/min flow rate at room temperature with a linear gradient of 0% solvent B to 100% B over 30 min (solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O; solvent B, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). We used two protocols to crystallize the P and N complexes. The first protocol included a monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab28) that we have used previously to crystallize non-cross-linked complexes of HIV-1 RT with nucleic acid (20Ding J. Das K. Hsiou Y.

Specifically, the peak fractions containing the p66·DNA·p51 fractions were pooled, concentrated to 20–25 mg/ml, and mixed with Fab28 at 1:0.8 mass ratio (23Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G.

Hanging drops were prepared by mixing equal volumes of the complex and crystallization solutions (100 mm cacodylate, pH 5.6, 31–34% saturated ammonium sulfate) at 4 °C. The second protocol was essentially that used previously to crystallize the catalytic complex of cross-linked RT·DNA with incoming dNTP (1Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C.

https://openalex.org/W2094901755,"Yin6 is a yeast homolog of Int6, which is implicated in tumorigenesis. We show that Yin6 binds to and regulates proteasome activity. Overexpression of Yin6 strengthens proteasome function while inactivation weakens and causes the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins including securin/Cut2 and cyclin/Cdc13. Yin6 regulates the proteasome by preferentially interacting with Rpn5, a conserved proteasome subunit, and affecting its localization/assembly. We showed previously that Yin6 cooperates with Ras1 to mediate chromosome segregation; here, we demonstrate that Ras1 similarly regulates the proteasome via Rpn5. In yeast, human Int6 binds Rpn5 and regulates its localization. We propose that human Int6, either alone or cooperatively with Ras, influences proteasome activities via Rpn5. Inactivating Int6 can lead to accumulation of mitotic regulators affecting cell division and mitotic fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W2089689049,"The CACNA2D2 gene, a new subunit of the Ca(2+)-channel complex, was identified in the homozygous deletion region of chromosome 3p21.3 in human lung and breast cancers. Expression deficiency of the CACNA2D2 in cancer cells suggests a possible link of it to Ca(2+) signaling in the pathogenesis of lung cancer and other cancers. We investigated the effects of overexpression of CACNA2D2 on intracellular Ca(2+) contents, mitochondria homeostasis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis by adenoviral vector-mediated wild-type CACNA2D2 gene transfer in 3p21.3-deficient nonsmall cell lung cancer cell lines. Exogenous expression of CACNA2D2 significantly inhibited tumor cell growth compared with the controls. Overexpression of CACNA2D2 induced apoptosis in H1299 (12.5%), H358 (13.7%), H460 (22.3%), and A549 (50.1%) cell lines. Levels of intracellular free Ca(2+) were elevated in AdCACNA2D2-transduced cells compared with the controls. Mitochondria membrane depolarization was observed prior to apoptosis in Ad-CACNA2D2 and Adp53-transduced H460 and A549 cells. Release of cyt c into the cytosol, caspase 3 activation, and PARP cleavage were also detected in these cells. Together, these results suggest that one of the pathways in CACNA2D2-induced apoptosis is mediated through disruption of mitochondria membrane integrity, the release of cyt c, and the activation of caspases, a process that is associated with regulation of cytosolic free Ca(2+) contents."

Jouault T. Trinel P.A. Poulain D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 149-154PubMed Google Scholar). Endocytosis of C. albicans by macrophages was specifically associated with the reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the downstream product, p90rsk, through activation of a specific phosphatase, MKP-1 (3Ibata-Ombetta S. Jouault T. Trinel P.A. Poulain D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 149-154PubMed Google Scholar). Both ERK1/2 and p90rsk have been shown to regulate survival of different cells (4Jin K. Mao X.O. Zhu Y. Greenberg D.A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 5Tan Y. Ruan H. Demeter M.R. Comb M.J. J. Biol.

They are involved in maintaining the phosphorylated state of Bad, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that plays an important role in mediating signal transduction pathways leading to apoptosis. Bad function is regulated by phosphorylation at two sites, serine 112 (Ser-112) and serine 136 (Ser-136) (7Masters S.C. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45193-45200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Whereas Ser-136 phosphorylation is associated with activation of Akt, Ser-112 phosphorylation requires activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (8Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Bad is held by the 14-3-3 protein, freeing Bcl-x(L) and Bcl-2 to promote survival (7Masters S.C. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45193-45200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Unphosphorylated Bad dissociates from 14-3-3 and recruits Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) to initiate events that lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation (9Korsmeyer S.J.

In host tissues, C. albicans may be both intra- and extracellular (23Calderone R. Candida and Candidiasis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002Google Scholar). Macrophages undergo apoptotic cell death after infection with C. albicans strains capable of hyphal formation (24Schroppel K. Kryk M. Herrmann M. Leberer E. Rollinghoff M. Bogdan C. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 290: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and activation of caspase 3 has been observed after endocytosis of C. albicans by neutrophils (25Rotstein D. Parodo J. Taneja R. Marshall J.C. Shock. 2000; 14: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that the cell wall surface ofC. albicans is coated with a phylogenetically unique molecule, phospholipomannan (PLM),1 composed of oligomannose residues with a unusual type of linkage and phytoceramide (26Trinel P.A.

Slomianny C. Jouault T. Gomez J. Trinel P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4323-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). PLM is shed by C. albicans in contact with macrophages (28Jouault T. Fradin C. Trinel P.A. Bernigaud A. Poulain D. J Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 792-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and displays potent activity on the innate immune response (29Jouault T. Bernigaud A. Lepage G. Trinel P.A. Poulain D. Immunology. 1994; 83: 268-273PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the modulation of signals downstream from ERK1/2 and p90rsk was investigated, with special attention to the regulation of cell survival induced after endocytosis of C. albicans. The participation of C. albicans PLM as an inducer of apoptosis was then determined using highly purified and well characterized PLM. The addition of PLM to cells was found to allow survival of the sensitive yeast S. cerevisiae. This was associated with down-regulation of ERK1/2-dependent Bad Ser-112 phosphorylation in host cells and alteration of cell integrity leading to apoptosis. All reagents were obtained from Sigma. Specific rabbit polyclonal IgGs to the phosphorylated forms of Bad (Ser- or Ser-136), ERK1/2, and p90rsk were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-Bcl-2 rabbit polyclonal IgG was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Southern Biotechnology Laboratories (Birmingham, AL). Anti-β-1,2-oligomannoside monoclonal antibody AF1 was provided by A. Cassone (28Jouault T. Fradin C. Trinel P.A. Bernigaud A. Poulain D. J Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 792-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mouse macrophage-like cell line, J774 (ECACC 85011428), was derived from a tumor of a female BALB/c mouse. Adherent cells were cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Valbiotech, Paris, France), 5 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml penicillin. Before use, cells were gently scraped off with a rubber policeman and, depending on the experiment, either plated into eight-well Labtek tissue culture chambers (Nunc, Naperville, IL) at a concentration of 0.5 × 106cells/well for microscopic analysis or into 12-well tissue culture dishes at a concentration of 106 cells/well in 1 ml of culture medium (for biochemical analysis). C. albicansVW32 (serotype A) and S. cerevisiae Su1 (3Ibata-Ombetta S. Jouault T. Trinel P.A. Poulain D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 149-154PubMed Google Scholar) were used throughout this study. Yeasts were maintained on Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) at 4 °C. Before the experiments, yeast cells were transferred onto fresh SDA and incubated for 20 h at 37 °C. Yeast cells were then recovered, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and transferred into DMEM. Heat-killed yeasts were prepared by heating 20 × 106 yeasts/ml in sterile water at 95 °C for 15 min. Efficiency of killing was determined by culture of treated yeasts on SDA for 48 h at 37 °C. The presence of PLM at the cell wall surface of yeasts was examined by Western blot using the anti-β-1,2 oligomannoside monoclonal antibody AF1 as described previously (28Jouault T. Fradin C. Trinel P.A. Bernigaud A. Poulain D. J Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 792-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PLM from C. albicans was prepared by extensive purification partition and hydrophobic interaction steps as described previously (26Trinel P.A. Maes E. Zanetta J.P. Delplace F. Coddeville B. Jouault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37260-37271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The structure of this molecule was determined by a combination of methanolysis/HPLC, phosphorus/proton NMR, and ion spray mass spectrometry methods and is shown in Fig.1A. This study involved the batch of C. albicans PLM recovered from these structural studies after analysis by nondenaturing methods. J774 cells were gently scraped with a rubber policeman and distributed into 12-well culture plates at a concentration of 106 cells/well. After 18 h, the adherent cells were washed with culture medium. For co-cultivation studies, plated cells were incubated with yeasts at a concentration of 20 yeasts/J774 cell. After incubation for various times, the cultures were washed with DMEM to remove unbound yeast cells and prepared for either biochemical analysis or fungicidal assays. In some experiments, cells were incubated with different concentrations of PLM in culture medium for 1 h before the addition of yeast cells. For assessment of the effect of PLM on macrophage responses, different concentrations of PLM were added to plated J774 cells and incubated for various periods of time before preparation for either biochemical analysis or fungicidal assays. Stimulated cells were washed with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and 10 mmNaF. The cultures were extracted with 500 μl of boiling 2× concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer (1× electrophoresis sample buffer: 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue). Lysates were collected and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × gat 4 °C. Extracted proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE before blotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) for 2 h at 200 mA in a semidry transfer system. After staining with 0.1% Ponceau S in 5% acetic acid to confirm equivalence of loading and transfer, the membrane was blocked by incubation with TNT (10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at 20 °C. Membranes were probed with phosphospecific antibodies (diluted 1:1000) or anti-Bcl-2 IgG (diluted 1:250) in TNT-5% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. After washing several times, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at 20 °C with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG in TNT-5% bovine serum albumin. After washing, the membrane was incubated with ECL detection reagents (SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate) (Pierce) and exposed to hyperfilm ECL. After stimulation, J774 cells were washed with warm DMEM and fixed and permeabilized with 3.7% formaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate buffer at 20 °C for 20 min. After three washes with phosphate buffer, 100 μl of a 1:100 dilution of anti-Bcl-2 antibody was added for 2 h at 20 °C. After five washes, 100 μl of a 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in phosphate buffer was added for 1 h at 20 °C. Slides were then washed five times and mounted for microscopic examination. Detection of apoptotic and necrotic cells after incubation with yeasts or PLM was performed by fluorescence microscopy with the annexin V-propidium iodide apoptosis detection kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) on unfixed cells as recommended by the manufacturer. J774 cells (2 × 106) were collected after incubation at 37 °C for 16 h with PLM and centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min at 20 °C. Pelleted cells were incubated for 1 h at 50 °C in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton-X 100, 100 μg/ml proteinase K). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 400 × gfor 30 min at 20 °C, and the supernatants were deproteinized twice by phenol-chloroform (1:1) extraction and once by chloroform extraction. The mixtures were treated with 50% isopropyl alcohol, 0.5m NaCl at −20 °C overnight for DNA precipitation. Precipitates were pelleted, washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and reconstituted with 20 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Aliquots (10 μl) were applied to horizontal agarose gels (2%) and subjected to a standard electrophoresis procedure. Gels were stained with 5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. Mitochondrial alteration during apoptosis was examined in J774 cells after incubation for 120 min without or with 10 μg/ml PLM. Treated cells were incubated for 15 min with 10 μm YOPRO-1 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), a vital fluorescent DNA dye that allows visualization of the alterations to the plasma membrane (30Idziorek T. Estaquier J. De Bels F. Ameisen J.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 185: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and with 100 nm chloromethyl-X-rosamine (CMX-Ros) to reveal the integrity of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (31Gilmore K. Wilson M. Cytometry. 1999; 36: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Coulter; Beckman). J774 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with yeast cells in the presence or absence of PLM, washed with DMEM, and then recultured at 37 °C for a further 90 min. The cultures were washed with DMEM, and endocytosed yeast cells were released by lysing the J774 cells with sterile water. The yeast cells recovered were counted, and 100 individual yeast cells in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline were plated onto SDA. After incubation for 24 h, the number of colony-forming units was determined. Autoradiograms were scanned, and densitometry analysis was performed using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the World Wide Web at rbs.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). It has previously been shown that endocytosis of C. albicans by J774 cells is associated with modulation of the MEK-ERK signal transduction pathway, leading to decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and its downstream product, p90rsk (3Ibata-Ombetta S. Jouault T. Trinel P.A. Poulain D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 149-154PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated p90rsk targets a Ser residue at position 112 of Bad in contrast to Akt-1/protein kinase B, which phosphorylates Bad at Ser-136 (8Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). As ERK1/2 and p90rsk phosphorylation were altered after ingestion of C. albicans by J774 cells, the effect of yeast engulfment on Bad phosphorylation was investigated. Fig. 2shows that after incubation of J774 cells with S. cerevisiaeblastoconidia, p90rsk phosphorylation was associated with high levels of phosphorylation of Bad at both Ser-112 and Ser-136. In cells incubated for 15 min with C. albicans, a similar degree of phosphorylation of p90rsk and Bad at both Ser-112 and Ser-136 was observed. However, after a 60-min incubation with C. albicans, cells displayed a dramatic decrease in phosphorylation of p90rsk and a simultaneous and significantly lower phosphorylation of Bad, specifically at Ser-112. Phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-112 has been shown to be critical for its binding to 14-3-3 (8Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The absence of such phosphorylation frees Bad, which may complex with the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. The effect of endocytosis of C. albicans on the distribution of Bcl-2 was therefore investigated in an immunofluorescence assay. A similar distribution of Bcl-2 was observed in untreated J774 cells (Fig.3A) and in cells that had ingested S. cerevisiae blastoconidia (Fig.3B). In contrast, a strong decrease in Bcl-2 staining was observed in cells that had ingested C. albicans yeasts (Fig.3C). Analysis by Western blotting, to detect both free and complexed protein, revealed similar levels of Bcl-2 expression in cell extracts (Fig. 4). Together, these data show that the disappearance of Bcl-2 observed in the immunofluorescence assay could not be related to down-modulation of protein expression and suggest the formation of heterodimeric complexes between Bcl-2 and unphosphorylated Bad.Figure 4Western blotting of Bcl-2 in J774 cells after incubation with yeasts. J774 cells were either untreated or incubated with S. cerevisiae (S.c.) or C. albicans (C.a.) blastoconidia. After 60 min, cells were lysed as described. Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with anti-Bcl-2 antibodies. Blots were developed with ECL, and the autoradiograms were scanned. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Bad dephosphorylation, together with the disappearance of Bcl-2 staining in cells which had ingested C. albicans, suggest that the cells underwent apoptosis. The effect of ingestion of C. albicans (either alive or heat killed) and S. cerevisiae on the expression of phosphatidylserine at the outer leaflet of macrophages was investigated using propidium iodine staining to discriminate between necrosis and apoptosis. Staining with propidium iodine was similar irrespective of how the cells had been treated, showing that the cells were not affected by necrosis. No binding of annexin V was observed with control cells (Fig.5A) or with cells that had ingested S. cerevisiae (Fig. 5B). In contrast, binding of annexin V to cells that had ingested live C. albicans yeast cells, revealed that phosphatidylserine was exposed at the plasma membrane of these cells (Fig. 5C). When killed yeasts were used, no annexin V binding at the J774 cell membrane could be observed (Fig. 5D). Presence of PLM at the surface of C. albicans yeast cells is a characteristic of this pathogenic yeast, which makes it different from other strains of Candida or from S. cerevisiae (26Trinel P.A. Maes E. Zanetta J.P. Delplace F. Coddeville B. Jouault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37260-37271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Poulain D. Slomianny C. Jouault T. Gomez J. Trinel P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4323-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Comparison of the presence of PLM at the surface of live and heat-killed C. albicans(Fig. 6) revealed that the molecule was weakly detected in extracts from heat-killed yeasts compared with live yeast cells. We thus hypothesized that PLM could play a role in the alteration of the J774 cell response seen with C. albicanswhole live yeast cells. The effect of PLM on signal transduction was examined by incubating cells with PLM before the addition of eitherS. cerevisiae or C. albicans blastoconidia. As shown in Fig. 7A, the addition of PLM to J774 cells led to a decreased capability of the cells to phosphorylate ERK1/2 in response to ingestion of S. cerevisiae. This inhibition depended on the dose of PLM used, a 10 μg/ml concentration of PLM being sufficient to obtain 40% inhibition of the signal. Incubation of J774 cells with PLM before the addition ofC. albicans also led to the extinction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation when the highest concentration of PLM was used (50 μg/ml). The influence of PLM on the ERK1/2 pathway and downstream products was confirmed by the decreased phosphorylation of p90rsk observed in cells pretreated with 50 μg/ml PLM before the addition of yeasts (Fig. 7B).Figure 7Modulation of ERK1/2 and p90rskphosphorylation by PLM. J774 cells were incubated with different concentrations (0− 50 μg/ml) of PLM for 60 min at 37 °C. EitherS. cerevisiae or C. albicans blastoconidia were then added or not (none) to the cells. After a 60-min incubation, the cells were washed and extracted. Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with antibodies specific for phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 (A) or p90rsk (B). Blots were developed with ECL, and the autoradiograms were scanned. The data shown are representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The ability of PLM to alter the signaling response induced in cells during endocytosis and its effect on the capability of treated cells to kill endocytosed yeasts were then investigated. As shown in Fig. 8, treatment of J774 cells with PLM before the addition of yeasts led to a decreased capability of J774 cells to kill S. cerevisiae. The inhibitory effect of PLM depended on the dose used for pretreating the cells (Fig. 8A) and was maximal with 50 μg/ml PLM. With this dose, 28 ± 2% of blastoconidia that had been ingested by the cells survived compared with 5 ± 5% of blastoconidia that survived after ingestion by untreated control cells (Fig.8B). The effect of PLM treatment on Bcl-2 staining after ingestion ofS. cerevisiae by J774 cells was then determined (Fig.9). As shown above (Fig. 3), cells that had ingested S. cerevisiae presented strong Bcl-2 immunostaining (Fig. 9A). Treatment with PLM before the addition of yeasts led to reduced, if any, staining of the protein (Fig. 9B), which was comparable with that observed after endocytosis of C. albicans blastoconidia (Fig. 3). The direct effect of PLM on J774 cell apoptosis was then determined. J774 cells were incubated with PLM, and evidence of apoptosis was sought by different methods. The effect of incubation with PLM on cell membrane permeability and mitochondrial potential was examined by flow cytometry (Fig.10). In the absence of PLM treatment, 86.3% of cells were negative for YOPRO-1, revealing plasma membrane integrity of the cells (Fig. 10A), and positive by CMX-Ros staining, revealing intact mitochondrial potential (Fig.10B). After treatment with PLM, although most cells were unlabeled with YOPRO-1 (Fig. 10C), more than 34% of cells presented negative staining with CMX-Ros, showing that the mitochondria were altered by the treatment (Fig. 10D). The apoptotic process induced by PLM was confirmed using annexin V to reveal phosphatidylserine expression on the external side of the treated cell membrane. Compared with untreated cells (Fig.11, A and C), binding of annexin V to the cell membrane was most obvious after incubation of the cells with PLM (Fig. 11, B and D). Apoptosis of cells after incubation with PLM was also confirmed by the DNA fragmentation observed in these cells, which was related to the dose of PLM used (Fig. 12). Several pathogens are known to interfere with host cell apoptotic control (32Monack D. Falkow S. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Depending on their parasitic behavior, differential triggering of cell survival or cell death is used by microbes to promote their survival. The yeast C. albicans has been reported to inhibit tumor necrosis factor-α-induced DNA fragmentation in macrophages (33Heidenreich S. Otte B. Lang D. Schmidt M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and to induce apoptosis of macrophages (24Schroppel K. Kryk M. Herrmann M. Leberer E. Rollinghoff M. Bogdan C. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 290: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and neutrophils (25Rotstein D. Parodo J. Taneja R. Marshall J.C. Shock. 2000; 14: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms and C. albicans molecules involved are unknown. It has previously been shown that, in contrast to the nonpathogenic yeastS. cerevisiae, C. albicans was able to specifically alter signal transduction of the MEK-ERK pathway (3Ibata-Ombetta S. Jouault T. Trinel P.A. Poulain D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 149-154PubMed Google Scholar). This down-modulation of the cell machinery decreased phosphorylation of p90rsk, resulting in survival of ingested yeast cells. In this study, the alteration of ERK1/2 and p90rsk phosphorylation was observed to end with the specific dephosphorylation of Bad at Ser-112. Dephosphorylation of Bad, which allows it to complex with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologues, is known to induce mitochondrial events leading to apoptosis (9Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1693-1700PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). In our C. albicans model, heat-killed yeasts did not induce apoptosis. However, due to PLM hydrophylicity (conferred by its glycan moiety), this molecule is not retained within the cell wall of dead cells (see Fig. 6); conventional heat treatment resulted in a dramatic decrease in the PLM associated with heat-killed yeasts placed in contact with macrophages. This prompted us to consider PLM, rather than any other mechanism triggered by living yeasts, as the molecule responsible for the proapoptotic activity of C. albicans on macrophages. The PLM proapoptotic effect was strong enough to promote the survival of the sensitive yeast S. cerevisiae when theC. albicans-derived molecule PLM was added together withS. cerevisiae to macrophages (Fig. 1B). Extensive literature exists on the effects of surface glycolipids from pathogens on the control of host cell apoptosis (36Ropert C. Gazzinelli R.T. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The lipoarabinomannan from the prokaryotic intracellular pathogenMycobacteria tuberculosis promotes macrophage survival by mediating phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-136 in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent manner (15Maiti D. Bhattacharyya A. Basu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 329-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The lipophosphoglycan from Leishmania donovani, which is a glycolipid present at the cell surface of an eukaryotic intracellular pathogen belonging to the family Trypanosomatideaea, also promotes host cell survival (19Moore K.J. Matlashewski G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2930-2937PubMed Google Scholar). However, depending on the structure of the glycolipid, opposite effects may also be observed. The glycosylinositol phospholipid from Trypanosoma cruzi, another member of the Trypanosomatideaea with an extracellular parasitic phase, induces host cell apoptosis (20Freire-de-Lima C.G. Nunes M.P. Corte-Real S. Soares M.P. Previato J.O. Mendonca-Previato L. DosReis G.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4909-4916PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to lipophosphoglycan, the lipid core of glycosylinositol phospholipid belongs to a family of ceramides whose proapoptotic effects are well known (37Rodriguez-Lafrasse C.

C. albicans PLM is expressed at the cell wall surface of live yeasts and binds to and stimulates macrophages through a process of shedding from the yeast cell wall initiated by contact (26Trinel P.A.

Recent structural investigations have shown that the PLM glycan moiety composed of long linear chains of β-1,2-oligomannosides (40Trinel P.A. Plancke Y. Gerold P. Jouault T. Delplace F. Schwarz R.T.

Although β-1,2-oligomannosides per se have been demonstrated to act as adhesins (41Fradin C. Jouault T. Mallet A. Mallet J.M. Camus D. Sinay P. Poulain D. J.

Immun. 1995; 63: 2378-2381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the proapoptotic properties of PLM are more likely to be related to its lipid core (38Liu G. Kleine L. Hebert R.L. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 511-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 45Ruvolo P.P. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Ceramides have been shown to interfere either with the ERK1/2 signaling pathway (46Kitatani K. Akiba S. Hayama M. Sato T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or the PI-3k and Akt/protein kinase B pathway, which regulates Bad activity at Ser-136 (47Kanto T. Kalinski P. Hunter O.C. Lotze M.T. Amoscato A.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3773-3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 48Kim D.S. Kim S.Y. Moon S.J. Chung J.H. Kim K.H. Cho K.H. Park K.C. Pigment Cell Res. 2001; 14: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Bad dephosphorylation at Ser-136 by prolonged inactivation of Akt/protein kinase B (49Basu S. Bayoumy S. Zhang Y. Lozano J. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30419-30426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) has been described as ceramide-induced apoptosis in Bad-expressing COS-7 cells through a mechanism involving Ras-MEK1. In this study, no alteration of phosphorylation of Ser-136 was observed. This argues against a role for Akt/protein kinase B in C. albicans-induced interference. This was confirmed by treatment of cells with wortmanin, a well known inhibitor of PI-3k and consequently of Akt/protein kinase B and Bad phosphorylation at Ser-136 (50Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4542) Google Scholar). This treatment did not change the viability of yeasts after ingestion by J774 cells (data not shown). The hypothesis that the PLM ceramide moiety may be responsible for apoptosis is nonetheless coherent with the observed transduction pathways, since (i) ceramides have been shown to accelerate dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 (46Kitatani K. Akiba S. Hayama M. Sato T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and to inhibit cell growth through a mechanism involving protein kinase C-ε (51Bourbon N.A. Yun J. Berkey D. Wang Y. Kester M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1403-C1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and (ii) the down-regulation of ERK1/2 previously observed after endocytosis ofC. albicans was related to prolonged activation of MKP-1, a MEK-ERK-specific phosphatase whose expression also depends on n-protein kinase C activation (3Ibata-Ombetta S. Jouault T. Trinel P.A. Poulain D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 149-154PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which ceramide may induce apoptosis are multiple. It has recently been shown that ceramide may induce mitochondrial activation through Bax, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family closely related to Bad. This apoptosis was independent of caspase activation (52von Haefen C. Wieder T. Gillissen B. Starck L. Graupner V. Dorken B. Daniel P.T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4009-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Whether PLM-induced apoptosis depends on caspase activation remains to be determined. Endocytosis of Escherichia coli by macrophages has recently been described to activate the proapoptotic signal (53Hacker H. Furmann C. Wagner H. Hacker G. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3172-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this case, signaling was initiated by Toll-like receptor-2 and involved the adaptor, myeloid differentiation factor 88, and the caspase-9/-3-dependent mitochondrial amplification loop. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 may also directly recruit caspase-8 (54Aliprantis A.O. Yang R.B. Weiss D.S. Godowski P. Zychlinsky A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both the mitochondrial amplification loop and caspase-8 have recently been shown to be modulated by ERK phosphorylation (55Soderstrom T. Poukkula M. Holmstrom T. Heiskanen K. Eriksson J. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These differential mechanisms by which ceramide influences the balance between cell survival and cell death are probably closely related to their structure. In this respect, the phytoceramide nature of the C. albicans PLM lipid moiety raises an important question (26Trinel P.A. Maes E. Zanetta J.P. Delplace F. Coddeville B. Jouault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37260-37271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although our knowledge of phytoceramide and phytosphingosine synthesis or hydrolysis is still embryonic, the presence of these molecules in mammalian cells has been demonstrated, and several studies have suggested that, like ceramide, phytosphingosine may play an important role in cell growth or death of eukaryotic cells (56Tamiya-Koizumi K. Murate T. Suzuki M. Simbulan C.M. Nakagawa M. Takemura M. Furuta K. Izuta S. Yoshida S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 41: 1179-1189PubMed Google Scholar, 57Lee J.S. Min D.S. Park C. Park C.S. Cho N.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Due to their critical role in cell integrity, it is interesting to note that ceramide biosynthetic pathways are also critical for the establishment of fungal pathogens in the host. For the intracellular pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, it has been recently shown that down-regulation ofC. neoformans inositolphosphoryl phytoceramide synthase (an early step in mannose inositol phosphoceramide synthesis) significantly decreased intracellular growth and resistance of this yeast in J774 macrophages (34Luberto C. Toffaletti D.L. Wills E.A. Tucker S.C. Casadevall A. Perfect J.R. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M.M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In conclusion, PLM was shown to cause by itself an alteration to host cells, which resulted in the cells undergoing apoptosis, as revealed by mitochondrial potential alteration, phosphatidylserine exposure at the plasma membrane, and DNA fragmentation. The apoptotic pathway induced is probably of pathophysiological significance, since killed yeasts did not display such activity and the addition of PLM allowed S. cerevisiae to survive to macrophage phagocytosis. The mechanisms involved in induction of host cell death remain obscure. Although participation of other yeast factors cannot be excluded, the unique phylogenetic structure of PLM makes it a worthy candidate for further investigation.

It has been widely supposed that these polypeptides are not natural products of the in vivo processing of ProTα, since neither was found in extracts in which proteolysis was prevented. Here we show that a lysosomal asparaginyl endopeptidase is able to process ProTα to generate Tα1 and Tα11. In view of its catalytic properties and structural and immunological analyses, this protease was identified as mammalian legumain. It selectively cleaves some of the asparaginyl-glycine residues in the ProTα sequence; specifically, Asn28-Gly29 and Asn35-Gly36 residues are cleaved with similar efficiency in vitro to generate Tα1 and Tα11, respectively. By contrast Tα1 is the main product detected in vivo, free in the cytosol, at concentrations similar to that of ProTα.

Thymosin α1(Tα1; 28 amino acids) is the most abundant α-thymosin in TF5 and was the first to be isolated and sequenced (3Goldstein A.L. Low T.L.K. McAdoo M. McClure J. Thurman G.B. Rossio J. Lai C-Y.

A less abundant TF5 component named thymosin α11(Tα11) has subsequently been characterized (4Caldarella J. Goodall G.J. Felix A.M. Heimer E.P. Salvin S.B. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A polypeptide including Tα1 in its structure has been detected among the translation products of calf thymus mRNAs (6Freire M. Crivellaro O. Isaacs C. Moschera S. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sequencing indicated that it comprised 109–111 amino acids, including the sequence of Tα11 (and thus Tα1) at its N terminus (11Haritos A.A. Blacher R. Stein S. Caldarella J. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl.

Recent Research Developments in Proteins. 1. Transworld Research Network, Kerala, India2002: 257-276Google Scholar). Its wide distribution in mammalian tissues suggested that its function was probably not immunological, despite the apparent immunoregulatory properties of Tα1and Tα11. Subsequent studies indicated that ProTα has a generalized role in the proliferation of mammalian cells, by mechanisms involving migration to the nucleus (14Gómez-Márquez J. Segade F.

Reports from our group and others over recent years have provided increasing evidence that the nuclear function of ProTα involves interactions with histones (19Papamarcaki T. Tsolas O. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Dı́az-Jullien C. Pérez-Estévez A. Covelo G. Freire M. Biochim. Biophys.

Covelo G. Sarandeses C. Dı́az-Jullien C. Freire M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), arguing strongly for a role in chromatin remodeling. In further support of this view, ProTα enables nucleosome assembly (20Dı́az-Jullien C. Pérez-Estévez A. Covelo G. Freire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and modulates the activity of histone acetyltransferase p300 (23Cotter II, M.A. Robertson E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5722-5735Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Independently of ProTα and its function, uncertainty remains about the status of Tα1 and Tα11. When ProTα was isolated in 1984 from thymus extracts prepared under conditions in which proteolytic activity was prevented, Tα1 and Tα11 were not detected in reverse-phase HPLC separation of the extracts (8Haritos A.A. Goodall G.J. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1008-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This led to the suggestion that the presence of ProTα-derived α-thymosins in TF5 was an artifact resulting from uncontrolled proteolysis during preparation of TF5. In contrast, experiments performed in our laboratory, using isoelectric focusing rather than HPLC for α-thymosin detection, have indicated that Tα1 is indeed present in extracts of this type in diverse mammalian tissues (10Franco F.J. Dı̀az C. Barcia M. Freire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To resolve this controversy, we have been performing experiments designed to detect a protease in mammalian cells that is capable of processing ProTα to generate the α-thymosins. In this paper, we report the characterization of a lysosomal asparaginyl endopeptidase with the required specificity. The characteristics of this enzyme match those of legumain, a cysteine endopeptidase initially known only from plants (24Hara-Nishimura I. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1651-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and the trematode Schistosoma (25Klinkert M.Q. Felleisen R. Link G. Ruppel A. Beck E. Mol. Biochem.

Barret A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8090-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Experiments designed to assess the possible biological significance of the processing of ProTα by this enzyme are also presented. Cells used were transformed human B lymphocytes (NC-37). For subcellular fractionation, cells were washed and resuspended (about 2 × 108cells/ml) in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm acetic acid, 10 mm triethanolamine, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and then homogenated (15 strokes) in a Potter Teflon glass blender and then centrifuged (2000 × g for 10 min) to yield the nuclear pellet. The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g to obtain the cytoplasmic organelle fraction (mitochondria and lysosomes) as pellet, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 100,000 × g to obtain the microsome fraction as pellet and cytosol fraction as supernatant. The nuclear pellet was resuspended (2 × 108nuclei/ml) in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm PMSF, and then homogenated (10 strokes) in a Potter Teflon glass blender. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT) to yield the nucleoplasm fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.1 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF containing 0.5m NaCl and then incubated for 5 min at 0 °C and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min; the supernatant was then dialyzed against buffer A to yield the nuclear membrane fraction. The lysosome and mitochondria fractions were purified from the cytoplasmic organelle fraction by density gradient centrifugation in two sequential Percoll/metrizamide density gradients (27Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Lysosomes, mitochondria, microsomes, and nuclear membranes were extracted in citrate/phosphate buffer pH 4.5 or phosphate buffer pH 7.5, both containing 1% Triton X-114, for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Digitonin permeabilization was carried out as described (28Weigel P.H. Ray D.A. Oka J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in ice-cold PBS (30 volumes), and the suspension was brought to 0.02% (w/v) digitonin (diluted from a 14 mg/ml stock solution). Cells were allowed to permeabilize for 2 min on ice, and the released cytosolic components were recovered by centrifugation at 800 × g. A heat-stable acidic polypeptide fraction (including the α-thymosins) was obtained from whole cell extracts or from subcellular fractions by a modification of the procedure of Goldstein et al. (1Goldstein A.L. Guha A. Zatz M. Hardy M.A. White A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1800-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), as previously described (10Franco F.J. Dı̀az C. Barcia M. Freire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen cells or subcellular fractions were pulverized under liquid nitrogen with a chilled pestle and mortar, dispersed in 10 volumes of boiling 0.15 m NaCl, and homogenized in a Waring blender. The homogenates were centrifuged, the supernatants were brought to pH 2.5, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatants were brought up to 70 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and then loaded into a DEAE-cellulose chromatography column, which was eluted with 0.4m NaCl to give the fraction of acidic polypeptides. ProTα was purified from the acidic polypeptides fraction by reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) on a Nucleosyl 300-C18 column (Sugelabor) (5 μm; 4.6 × 250 mm) in a Beckman HPLC System. Elution was done with a programmed gradient of n-propyl alcohol (0–50% v/v) in a 0.1% aqueous dilution of trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting purified ProTα was dephosphorylated by incubation for 30 min at room temperature with 1 unit of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase per μg of ProTα, in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing MgCl2 (1 mm) and ZnCl2(0.1 mm). Dephosphorylated ProTα was obtained from this reaction mixture by RP-HPLC as indicated above. Phosphorylation of ProTα with radioactive orthophosphate was done using ProTα protein kinase, purified as described (18Pérez-Estévez A. Dı́az-Jullien C. Covelo G. Salgueiro M.T. Freire M. J. Biol.

Briefly, a phosphorylation reaction mixture containing 50 μg of dephosphorylated ProTα, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 26 mm MgCl2, 1.6 mm EGTA, 3.3 mm DTT, 80 ng/ml protamine, 83 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 100 mm [32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) in a total volume of 250 μl was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. [32P]ProTα was then obtained by RP-HPLC as described above. Tα1 and Tα11 were a gift from Dr. Heimer (Hoffman-Roche). Isoelectrofocusing was carried out as described previously (10Franco F.J. Dı̀az C. Barcia M. Freire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were applied to PAG plates with a pH range of 4.0–6.5 (Amersham Biosciences) and electrofocused for 2.5 h (2000 V, 25 mA, 25 watts) in a LKB Multiphor isoelectric focusing cell thermostatted at 10 °C. The isoelectrofocused gel was fixed with trichloroacetic/sulfosalycilic acid and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G. Slab gel electrophoresis was carried out on 18% polyacrylamide gels by the method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained different concentrations of ProTα (15–30 μg) plus crude or purified cell extract (1–15 μg) in 45 μl of 0.1 mammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, plus 0.5 mm DTT or 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, plus 0.5 mm DTT. In some experiments, protease inhibitors were added. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 8 h. The reaction products were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, RP-HPLC, or isoelectrofocusing, as indicated under “Results.” The structures of the processing products, obtained by RP-HPLC or from extracts of bands in SDS-PAGE, were established by analysis of the amino acid composition of their tryptic peptides, as previously described (10Franco F.J. Dı̀az C. Barcia M. Freire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Lysosomes of NC-37 cells were extracted with 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 1 mm EDTA containing 1% Triton X-114; the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 5 min, and the supernatant was passed through 0.22-μm nitrocellulose filters. The filtrate was then applied to anAmersham Biosciences Mono-S FPLC column (type HR 5/5) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 10 mm NaCl. Elution was with a NaCl gradient (10–1000 mm) in the same buffer. 1-ml fractions were collected and tested for asparaginyl endopeptidase activity by fluorimetric assays with the synthetic peptide benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asn-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Bachem) as substrate, as described (30Manoury B. Hewitt E.W. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). ProTα processing activity was also assayed in the different fractions, as detailed above. Deglycosylation of the purified protease was carried out by incubation of aliquots of purified protease in 250 μl of buffer containing 0.1m citric acid, 0.2 m NaHPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.025% CHAPS, pH 7.2, at 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling, 0.53 milliunits of N-glucidase-F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added, and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The protease was then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by immuno-Western blotting as indicated below. Western blotting assays were performed by transferring the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. A polyclonal legumain antiserum was custom-produced by Neosystem Laboratories (Strasbourg, France) against the human legumain sequence fragment KGIGSGKVLKKSPQ, as previously used for antibody production (30Manoury B. Hewitt E.W. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Neosystem Laboratories also supplied preimmune serum from the same rabbit. The effect of the legumain antiserum antibodies on the ProTα-processing activity of the different cell fractions was investigated by previous incubation of the fraction of interest with different concentrations of immune or nonimmune serum, in the absence or presence of the peptide KGIGSGKVLKKSPQ in PBS, for 1 h at room temperature. ProTα processing was then assayed as described above. To investigate the intracellular processing of ProTα, we performed a systematic study of ProTα-proteolytic activities of various subcellular fractions of human lymphoma cells (NC-37), including nucleoplasm, cytosol, nuclear membranes, cytosolic organelles, and microsome fractions. The effect of pH on proteolytic activity was also investigated, on the basis of assays at physiological and acid pH. Analysis by SDS-PAGE of the various reaction mixtures (Fig.1A) indicated that proteolysis of ProTα occurred only in reaction mixtures containing the cytosolic organelle fraction. This proteolytic activity was dependent on pH, being detected only at pH 4.5. To further localize the proteolytic activity in the cytosolic organelle fraction, we separated mitochondrial and lysosomal subfractions from this fraction by density gradient centrifugation and assayed ProTα-proteolytic activity in extracts of these subfractions at different pH values. As indicated in Fig. 1B, proteolytic activity was localized only in the lysosomal subfraction and again required acid pH. Since the lysosomal extracts were originally prepared at pH 7.5, we investigated the possible influence of pH during extract preparation. To this end, lysosomes were extracted at pH 4.5, and proteolytic activity was then assayed at pH 4.5 or at higher pH. As shown in Fig. 1C, ProTα-proteolytic activity assayed at pH 4.5 was markedly higher in extracts prepared at pH 4.5 than in extracts prepared at pH 7.5 (see Fig. 1B) and markedly higher when assayed at pH 4.5 than when assayed at pH 6.0 or 8.0. Note that nucleoplasm, microsome, nuclear membranes, mitochondria, and cytosolic fractions prepared at pH 4.5 still did not show ProTα-proteolytic activity (data not shown). Moreover, ProTα-proteolytic activity was detected only when disrupted lysosomes were assayed, not in assays without previous lysosome disruption (data not shown). An important characteristic of the pattern of proteolysis of ProTα by the acidic lysosomal lysates is that two of the fragments of ProTα had the same electrophoretic mobility as synthetic Tα1 and Tα11 (Fig.1C). To further investigate processing of ProTα, we investigated the influence of various protease inhibitors on the pattern of fragments obtained with the lysosomal lysate. Analysis of the different reaction mixtures showed rather surprising results (Fig. 1D), since the ProTα fragmentation pattern was not modified by any of the broad spectrum protease inhibitors used (including serine, cysteine, and aspartic protease inhibitors) but was markedly modified by protease inhibitor iodoacetamide, which efficiently prevented the processing. This indicated that a particular cysteine protease activity is involved in the processing of ProTα. Since ProTα is phosphorylated by a cytosolic threonine protein kinase with unknown structure (18Pérez-Estévez A. Dı́az-Jullien C. Covelo G. Salgueiro M.T. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10506-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we next investigated the influence of ProTα phosphorylation on the proteolysis pattern. Specifically, we compared proteolysis of dephosphorylated ProTα and ProTα phosphorylated in vitro by the purified ProTα protein kinase with [32P]ATP as cosubstrate. Results of these experiments (data not shown) indicate that phosphorylation of ProTα did not affect its proteolysis by the lysosomal lysates. The above results suggest the existence of a specific lysosomal protease activity that is highly dependent on pH and that is able to cleave ProTα, even in the presence of broad spectrum protease inhibitors, yielding four fragments, two of which have the same electrophoretic mobility as Tα1 and Tα11. To characterize the different products derived from the processing of ProTα by the lysosomal protease activity, we used in the first instance RP-HPLC. The elution pattern for ProTα-processing products obtained with the lysosomal extract at pH 4.5 showed four peaks (Fig.2A). Analysis by SDS-PAGE of these four peaks (inset in Fig. 2A) showed that a polypeptide with the same electrophoretic mobility as Tα1is the main component in peak 1; peaks 2 and 3 are mixtures of this component and the other ProTα fragments, and peak 4 is whole ProTα. Similar elution patterns were obtained when chromatographic conditions were varied. Characterization of the component in peak 1 was accomplished by determining the amino acid composition of its tryptic peptides, as separated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 2B). The tryptic map and amino acid composition of the peak-1 polypeptide proved identical to that of Tα1 (Fig. 2B). Structural analysis of the other ProTα-processing products (those eluting in peaks 2 and 3) was carried out by tryptic digestion of the respective bands excised from the SDS-PAGE gels in which the components of the processing assay reaction mixtures had been separated. The amino acid compositions of the tryptic peptides derived from these products and separated by RP-HPLC (data not shown) indicate that the component with the same electrophoretic mobility as synthetic Tα11 is indeed Tα11, whereas the two fragments with higher electrophoretic mobility correspond to residues 29–109 and 36–109 of the ProTα sequence. In view of these structural analyses, summarized in Fig. 2C, we conclude that the lysosomal protease cleaves ProTα at Asn-Gly residues located at positions 28–29 to yield Tα1 and at positions 35–36 to yield Tα11, whereas the resulting C-terminal portions of ProTα, positions 29–109 and 36–109, remain undigested. To judge by the concentrations of the respective bands in the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 2C), both Tα1 and Tα11 are produced in similar proportions by the lysosomal protease, whereas the concentrations of fragments 29–109 and 36–109 appear to be lower. However, this discrepancy should probably be attributed to low efficiency in the Coomassie staining of the larger (highly acidic) fragments of ProTα, rather than to a lower concentration in the processing products, since extracts of the respective bands (from SDS-PAGE) separated by RP-HPLC prior to structural analysis showed similar spectrophotometrically determined concentrations to Tα1 and Tα11(data not shown). In view of its specificity, then, this protease can be considered as an asparaginyl-glycyl endopeptidase, and this specificity is consistent with its ability to generate α-thymosinsin vivo. The characteristics of the lysosomal protease processing ProTα in vitro to yield Tα1 and Tα11 (including its specificity, its response to pH variations, and its resistance to protease inhibitors) strikingly resemble those of the mammalian form of legumain, a protease originally described in plants and recently reported to be involved in major histocompatibility complex-restricted antigen presentation in mammalian cells (30Manoury B. Hewitt E.W. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We therefore performed experiments to investigate whether the lysosomal asparaginyl endopeptidase that processes ProTα might be legumain. These experiments included legumain activity assays, immunodetection assays, and structural characterization. Fractionation of the lysosomal extracts by ion exchange FPLC demonstrated that the fractions showing ProTα-processing activity likewise showed legumain activity, as determined by fluorimetric assay using the synthetic substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asn-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Fig.3A). For immunodetection assays, we used antibodies raised against the peptide KGIGSKVCCKSCPQ (a fragment of the human legumain sequence that is coincident with that in other mammals) (30Manoury B. Hewitt E.W. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis of the FPLC-purified lysosomal lysates, shown in Fig. 3B, detected a protein with the same size (46 kDa) as human legumain, at a concentration similar to that in crude extract. Since active human legumain is glycosylated (31Chen J-M. Fortunato M. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 327-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of previous deglycosylation. In the FPLC-purified lysosomal lysate treated withN-glycosidase F, the legumain antiserum detected a protein with lower apparent molecular mass (41 kDa; Fig. 3B); this decrease is consistent with that reported after deglycosylation of other mammalian legumains (26Chen J-M. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Borwn M.A. Young N.E. Stevens R.A: Hewitt E. Watts C. Barret A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8090-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To complete the characterization of the enzyme processing ProTα, we investigated whether the legumain antiserum blocks the proteolysis of ProTα by the lysosomal protease. As indicated in Fig. 3C, the antibodies efficiently blocked processing of ProTα, whereas the corresponding nonimmune serum had no effect. However, no blockade occurred when the synthetic peptide used to obtain the immune serum was included in the processing assay reaction mixture (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained using crude lysosomal extracts (data not shown). These results provide further support for the view that the asparaginyl endopeptidase responsible for the processing of ProTαin vitro to generate Tα1 and Tα11 is legumain. To further study the processing of ProTα, we decided to investigate relationships between the observed proteolysis of ProTα by the legumain in vitrowith the processing seen in vivo. To this end, we compared the polypeptide pattern observed after ProTα processing in vitro with the α-thymosins pattern observed in lymphocytes, in which both ProTα and legumain are known to be present. Whole cell extracts and subcellular fractions were obtained from lymphocytes (NC-37 cells), in all cases under conditions in which proteolytic activity was strictly prevented. α-Thymosins in the acidic polypeptide fraction obtained from the diverse extracts were detected by isoelectrofocusing (IEF), a technique that is highly effective for the separation and identification of these peptides in different cell extracts (10Franco F.J. Dı̀az C. Barcia M. Freire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). IEF analysis of the α-thymosin components from whole-cell extracts of NC-37 cells is shown in Fig.4A. This analysis indicates that NC-37 cells contain components with the same pI as ProTα and Tα1 but not components with the same pI as Tα11 or the acidic fragments 29–109 and 36–109 of ProTα detected after in vitro processing. Structural analysis confirmed that the more acidic components were ProTα and Tα1. This IEF pattern and the similar concentrations of ProTα and Tα1 determined by densitometry (Fig. 4A) are in agreement with our previous findings indicating that Tα1 is naturally present in various mammalian tissues (10Franco F.J. Dı̀az C. Barcia M. Freire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and in line with the view that ProTα is processed in vivo by legumain or another protease with similar specificity to yield Tα1. We next investigated the intracellular location of Tα1 in NC-37 cells. IEF analysis of α-thymosins in the different subcellular fractions separated by differential centrifugation (Fig. 4B) and by digitonin permeabilization (Fig. 4C) indicated that Tα1 is located in the cytosolic fraction and is not associated with any cell organelle. The observed cytosolic location of ProTα (Fig. 4, B and C) is in agreement with the tendency of ProTα to leak out of isolated nuclei (15Manrow R.E. Sburlati A.R. Hanover J.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3916-3924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is worth pointing out that the α-thymosins obtained from both whole-cell extracts and from organelle fractions showed rather “messy” chromatographic behavior; thus, in the RP-HPLC analysis ProTα emerged as a clear peak, but Tα1 was retained for longer by the column and eluted as mixtures with other components in the α-thymosinic fraction (data not shown). Similar behavior was observed under diverse HPLC conditions, both reverse-phase and ion exchange. Data reported here strongly suggest that the presence of Tα1 in lymphocytes and other mammalian cells is due to the processing of ProTα by a lysosomal asparaginyl endopeptidase identified as legumain. This enzyme was recently discovered in mammals (26Chen J-M. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Borwn M.A. Young N.E. Stevens R.A: Hewitt E. Watts C. Barret A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8090-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), having been known previously only from plants (24Hara-Nishimura I. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1651-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and invertebrates (25Klinkert M.Q. Felleisen R. Link G. Ruppel A. Beck E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Mammalian legumain shows high specificity for a small subset of asparaginyl bonds; it appears to have no specific requirement for amino acids other than the asparagine, although it shows a preference for Ala or Pro at position P3 (i.e. the third residue in the N-terminal direction) (32Dando P.M. Fortunato M. Smith L. Knight C.G. McKendrick J.E. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The specificity of legumain with ProTα as substrate is in line with these characteristics, but it also shows a special requirement for a Gly at P1′. Specifically, in vitro the enzyme only cleaves Asn–Gly bonds at positions 28–29 (with an Ala residue at P3) and 35–36 (with a Pro residue at P3) and appears not to cleave the Asn–Gly bond at positions 42–43 (which has a Glu at P3) or Asn bonds with other amino acids (Ala at position 38, Glu at positions 40 and 50). To judge from the analysis of the α-thymosins in cell extracts prepared under conditions in which proteolysis was absolutely prevented (Fig. 4), this protease shows even higher specificity in vivo, since only Tα1 (i.e. cleavage at positions 28–29) was detected at a concentration similar to ProTα, whereas Tα11 (i.e. cleavage at positions 35–36) was not detected, in line with previous studies of other mammalian tissues (10Franco F.J. Dı̀az C. Barcia M. Freire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the apparent absence of Tα11 is due to rapid degradation of this peptide in vivo. The nondetection of the larger ProTα fragment 29–109 (or 36–109) in cell extracts is likewise presumably indicative of rapid degradation of this fragmentin vivo. The presence of Tα11 at low concentrations in the calf thymus fraction TF5 (4Caldarella J. Goodall G.J. Felix A.M. Heimer E.P. Salvin S.B. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7424-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) might be due to the characteristics of the procedure used for its preparation. In fact, we did not detect this polypeptide in the α-thymosin fractions obtained (from calf thymus and other mammalian tissues) under the conditions used here (10Franco F.J. Dı̀az C. Barcia M. Freire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,33Freire M. Rey-Méndez M. Gómez-Márquez J. Arias P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 239: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As noted, the characteristics of the in vivo processing of ProTα suggest that it is accomplished by legumain. It is worth noting that additional confirmation of this conclusion by in vivoenzyme blockade is difficult, since specific inhibitors of this enzyme are not currently available and since the use of Asn-containing peptides as competitive inhibitors is inefficient when incubations of over 1 h are necessary (30Manoury B. Hewitt E.W. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In light of the present results, previous failures to detect Tα1 in extracts prepared under drastic denaturing conditions (8Haritos A.A. Goodall G.J. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1008-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) may perhaps be attributable to the “messy” chromatographic behavior of α-thymosins prepared under these conditions, due to their tendency to aggregate, as evidenced in the present and previous reports (10Franco F.J. Dı̀az C. Barcia M. Freire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Freire M. Rey-Méndez M. Gómez-Márquez J. Arias P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 239: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In fact, original isolation of Tα1 included gel filtration in the presence of 6m guanidium chloride (3Goldstein A.L. Low T.L.K. McAdoo M. McClure J. Thurman G.B. Rossio J. Lai C-Y. Chang D. Wang S-S. Harvey C. Ramel A.H. Meienhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In the present and previous studies (10Franco F.J. Dı̀az C. Barcia M. Freire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Freire M. Rey-Méndez M. Gómez-Márquez J. Arias P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 239: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we have used isoelectrofocusing, which, unlike the HPLC procedures used by other authors (8Haritos A.A. Goodall G.J. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1008-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), is effective for separating and identifying the α-thymosins. In this connection, it is also worth noting that antibodies raised against fragments of the N-terminal region of ProTα (the most immunogenic region; such antibodies have been widely used for immunodetection of ProTα) do not differentiate between ProTα and its N-terminal derivatives Tα1 and Tα11. To judge by the wide distribution of both Tα1 (10Franco F.J. Dı̀az C. Barcia M. Freire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and legumain (26Chen J-M. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Borwn M.A. Young N.E. Stevens R.A: Hewitt E. Watts C. Barret A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8090-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) in different tissues, we would suggest that ProTα processing to yield Tα1 is a generalized process in mammalian tissues. Interestingly, tissues showing high legumain activity such as lymphoid tissues (26Chen J-M. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Borwn M.A. Young N.E. Stevens R.A: Hewitt E. Watts C. Barret A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8090-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 30Manoury B. Hewitt E.W. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) also show high levels of Tα1 (10Franco F.J. Dı̀az C. Barcia M. Freire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The highly conserved primary structure of ProTα, especially around the asparagine/glycine bonds cleaved by legumain (13Freire M. Dı́az-Jullien C. Covelo G. Pandalai S.G. Recent Research Developments in Proteins. 1. Transworld Research Network, Kerala, India2002: 257-276Google Scholar), provides further support for the view that ProTα processing to yield Tα1 is generalized. Moreover, the present results indicate that processing of ProTα in vitrois independent of its phosphorylation state (ProTα is phosphorylated at specific residues when cells are activated to proliferate) (17Barcia M.G. Castro J.M. Jullien C.D. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4704-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pérez-Estévez A. Dı́az-Jullien C. Covelo G. Salgueiro M.T. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10506-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The presence of phosphorylated Tα1 in proliferating cells and the inability of the ProTα protein kinase to phosphorylate Tα1 (34Pérez-Estévez A. Freire J. Sarandeses C. Covelo G. Dı́az-Jullien C. Freire M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 208: 111-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) thus suggest that phospho-ProTα may be processed in vivo to yield phospho-Tα1. Proteolysis of ProTα at the Asp99 residue by caspase 3 has recently been reported to occur in HeLa cells in which apoptosis has been induced (35Evstafieva A.G. Belov G.A. Kalkum M. Chichkova N.V. Bogdanov A.A. Agol V.I. Vartapetian A.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36Enkemann S.A. Wang R.H. Trumbore M.W. Berger S.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This proteolysis has so far not been demonstrated to be a generalized process occurring in other cell types undergoing apoptosis and, in any case, occurs in an entirely different biological context (i.e. apoptosis) from that of the generation of Tα1 in proliferating or nonproliferating cells. Independently of this, the question remaining is why ProTα is processed by legumain to yield Tα1: simply as a step in the catabolism of ProTα, or in view of some biological function of Tα1? Our current knowledge about mammalian legumain may perhaps shed some light on this question. Legumain shows strict specificity for a restricted subset of asparaginyl bonds, which certainly suggests that it is unlikely to contribute to the gross catabolism of proteins but rather that it will tend to play more specific roles in protein processing (32Dando P.M. Fortunato M. Smith L. Knight C.G. McKendrick J.E. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the identification of legumain as a key protease in class-II MHC antigen processing (30Manoury B. Hewitt E.W. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In view of these considerations, the proteolysis of ProTα in lymphocytes and other mammalian cells is in our view likely to be selective processing rather than nonspecific degradation. The fact that Tα1 is present at high levels, similar to those of ProTα, suggests that Tα1 may have some biological function. The cytosolic location of Tα1, its demonstrated incapacity to migrate to the nucleus (15Manrow R.E. Sburlati A.R. Hanover J.A. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3916-3924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its lack of any known secretion signal (note that ProTα is synthesized in free polysomes) (37Eschenfeldt W.H. Manrow R.E. Krug M.S. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7546-7555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) argue for a nonnuclear intracellular function. This putative function may or may not be related to that of ProTα."

Compound 4 (C21H21N3O4S) reduces viral replication by virtue of its direct interaction with the viral polymerase rather than by nonspecific titration of nucleic acid template.

Inhibition of initial phosphodiester bond formation occurred regardless of whether replication was initiated by primer-dependent or de novo mechanisms. Filter binding studies using increasing concentrations of compound 4 did not interfere with the ability of Δ21 HCV RdRp to interact with nucleic acid. Furthermore, varying the order of reagent addition in the primer extension assay showed no distinct differences in inhibition profile. Finally, surface plasmon resonance analyses provided evidence that a ternary complex is capable of forming between the RNA template, RdRp, and compound 4. Together, these data suggest that this heterocyclic agent interacts with the apoenzyme, as well as with the RNA-bound form of Δ21 HCV RdRp, and therefore does not directly interfere with the RdRp-RNA interaction to mediate inhibition.

HCV causes significant liver disease, cirrhosis and can eventually lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. This disease is of significant concern because more than 27 of the world population is chronically infected with HCV. In infected cells, translation of the viral RNA yields a polyprotein (3Kato N.

Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), the HCV RdRp is capable of initiating viral RNA synthesis in vitro by a primer-dependent mechanism (9Behrens S.-E. Tomei L.

Recently, our understanding of HCV replication has been significantly improved by Hong et al. (22Hong Z. Cameron C.E. Walker M.P. Castro C. Yao N. Lau J.Y. Zhong W. Virol. 2001; 285: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), whose work resulted in the identification of a novel औ-loop near the catalytic site of the RdRp. This has provided a direct structural basis for de novoinitiation and suggests that the HCV RdRp can select against primer extension (22Hong Z. Cameron C.E. Walker M.P. Castro C. Yao N. Lau J.Y. Zhong W. Virol. 2001; 285: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cell-based HCV replicon systems, useful for studies of viral replication and antiviral agents, were developed in which the nonstructural proteins stably replicate subgenomic viral RNA in Huh7 cells (23Blight K.J.

In combination with studies using recombinant RdRps, such systems are proving to be invaluable in developing a better insight into the mechanisms of Flaviviridae RNA synthesis. This report describes the mechanism of action studies for the heterocyclic inhibitor of the HCV RdRp, compound 4(C21H21N3O4S, as described in Ref. 1Dhanak D. Duffy K. Johnston V.K. Lin-Goerke J. Darcy M. Shaw A.N.G.B. Silverman C. Gates A.T. Earnshaw D.L. Casper D.J. Kaura A. Baker A. Greenwood C. Gutshall L.L. Maley D. DelVecchio A. Macarron R. Hofmann G.A. Alnoah Z. Cheng H.-Y. Chan G.

HCV NS5B protein was purified as described previously (25Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Gajewski J.G.L. Maley D. Sarisky R.T. Kao C.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8615-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The RdRp assay was performed as described previously (25Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Gajewski J.G.L. Maley D. Sarisky R.T. Kao C.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8615-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Briefly, after a 15-min incubation, heparin was added to the reaction at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. At the same time that heparin was added, 15 ॖm 3′-ribodeoxy-GTP (3′-rdGTP), compound1 (C20H19N3O4S) or compound4 was also added. The reaction was continued for an additional 60 min and then terminated, processed, and analyzed as described previously (1Dhanak D. Duffy K. Johnston V.K. Lin-Goerke J. Darcy M. Shaw A.N.G.B. Silverman C. Gates A.T. Earnshaw D.L. Casper D.J. Kaura A. Baker A. Greenwood C. Gutshall L.L. Maley D. DelVecchio A. Macarron R. Hofmann G.A. Alnoah Z. Cheng H.-Y. Chan G. Khandekar S. Keenan R.M. Sarisky R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38322-38327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To specifically examine whether the thiadiazines can abrogate dinucleotide polymerization, the initiation step of replication, a direct initiation assay, was established. 100 ng (1 ॖm) of a 17-mer RNA (5′-GCGCACAGCGCACUAAC-3′) was utilized as the template, and a 2-fold molar excess of the initiation NTP, either GTP or the dinucleotide 5′-GpU3-′, and the second NTP, [α32-P]UTP, were used to initiate RNA synthesis in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 0.57 (v/v) Triton X-100. After 1 ॖm polymerase was added, the reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min, and then total RNA products were analyzed on a 257 polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5 murea. Reaction products (3-mer) were analyzed by autoradiography. Additionally, primer-dependent and de novoinitiation was measured with a single-stranded RNA template, LE21, that can direct both de novo initiation (which produces a 21-nt product) and primer extension (which produces a 34-nt product). Standard RdRp assays consisted of 2.5 pmol of template LE21 with 50–100 ng of NS5B in 20 ॖl containing final concentrations of 20 mm sodium glutamate at pH 8.2, 12 mmdithiothreitol, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, 0.57 (v/v) Triton X-100, 200 ॖm GTP, 100 ॖm ATP, 100 ॖmUTP, 250 nm [α-32P]CTP (400 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences), and ∼0.2 ॖl of 10 mCi/ml [α-32P]CTP. Reactions were performed at 25 °C. Compound 4 was used at a final concentration between 2.5 and 25 nm. The reaction products were separated on 207 polyacrylamide 7.5 m urea gel, exposed to a phosphorimaging screen, and quantified. Quatifications were normalized to the control reaction lacking compound 4 but containing an equivalent amount of Me2SO. Therefore, the percent inhibition of 21-nt product was expressed as percentage relative to that of the control reaction (taken as 07 inhibition). The amount of 34-nt product was also normalized in the same manner. In vitro binding reactions were carried out using 5 nm purified NS5BΔ21 in a 50-ॖl reaction volume containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.057 bovine serum albumin. Reaction mixtures containing increasing amounts of 33P end-labeled SLD8 RNA (5′-GGCUUGCAUAGCAAGUCUGAUAUGCGUCCAGAGACCA-3′) were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and then filtered immediately onto an 0.45 ॖmMF-membrane filter (Whatman), washed with 1.0 ml of ice-cold binding buffer, and counted in a scintillation counter. For studies using compound 4, two distinct preincubation protocols were followed. For one study, compound 4 was preincubated with polymerase and buffer for 15 min prior to the addition of RNA. Alternatively, the polymerase, RNA, and buffer were preincubated for 15 min prior to the addition of compound 4. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses were performed using a BIAcore 3000 equipped with a streptavidin sensor chip in a running buffer of 0.01 mHEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.0057 (v/v) surfactant P20, and 0.17 Me2SO. A biotinylated 36-mer RNA (5′-AUAUUAUCCUAUAUACCGGCUUGCAUAGCAAGCCGG-3′) was immobilized to a surface density of 30 response units (RU) by injecting 9 ॖl of a 2 nm solution at a flow rate of 10 ॖl/min. The following injection solutions were prepared in running buffer: 10 nmGTP, 10 nm phosphonoformic acid (PFA), 10 nmcompound 4, 10 nm HCV Δ21NS5B, 10 nm GTP with 10 nm HCV NS5bΔ21, 10 nm PFA with 10 nm HCV Δ21NS5B, and 10 nm compound 4 with 10 nm HCV Δ21NS5B. All solutions were preincubated at 25 °C for 15 min prior to injection. Samples were injected for 60 s at a flow rate of 75 ॖl/min and allowed to dissociate for 60 s. A regeneration injection of 2 m NaCl at 20 ॖl/min for 1 min followed each sample injection. The binding curves were analyzed in BIAevaluation. The benzo-1,2,4-thiadiazines (compounds 1 and4) were shown to be potent inhibitors of the HCV RdRp with biochemical IC50 values between 80 and 100 nm and cell-based IC50 values around 500 nm (1Dhanak D. Duffy K. Johnston V.K. Lin-Goerke J. Darcy M. Shaw A.N.G.B. Silverman C. Gates A.T. Earnshaw D.L. Casper D.J. Kaura A. Baker A. Greenwood C. Gutshall L.L. Maley D. DelVecchio A. Macarron R.

Calorimetry studies confirmed a direct interaction of these compounds with the viral polymerase and a window of selectivity for nucleic acid interaction. The standard RdRp assay described previously (25Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Gajewski J.G.L. Maley D. Sarisky R.T. Kao C.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8615-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) represents a continuous polymerization assay rather than single cycle synthesis. The RdRp assay was modified by adding heparin 15 min before initiation of RNA synthesis in an attempt to reduce the number of newly initiated rounds of RNA synthesis. Heparin functions as a nucleic acid mimic to titrate free enzyme, including polymerase molecules, which dissociate from the RNA during elongation. Therefore, in the presence of heparin, new reinitiation events should be impeded, and only RNA synthesized from already initiated complexes or complexes in the elongation phase should be measured. Using this assay format, compound 4 (1Dhanak D. Duffy K. Johnston V.K. Lin-Goerke J. Darcy M. Shaw A.N.G.B. Silverman C. Gates A.T. Earnshaw D.L. Casper D.J. Kaura A. Baker A. Greenwood C. Gutshall L.L. Maley D. DelVecchio A. Macarron R. Hofmann G.A. Alnoah Z. Cheng H.-Y. Chan G. Khandekar S. Keenan R.M. Sarisky R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38322-38327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and a 3′-rdGTP chain terminator were tested. The 3′-rdGTP is incorporated into the newly synthesized RNA product. However, unlike GTP, this analog cannot be extended further because a 3′-hydroxyl group is absent. This chain terminator would be expected to have a similar potency profile regardless of whether it is tested in the presence or absence of heparin, because heparin should not interfere with elongative synthesis. As shown in Fig. 1,A and B, the IC50 for 3′-rdGTP remained at ∼100 nm, both in the presence and absence of heparin. As expected, the total amount of radiolabel incorporated into the newly synthesized RNA template decreased around 7-fold in the presence of heparin, an observation consistent with single cycle synthesis. Interestingly, although compound 4 is a highly potent inhibitor in the standard assay (Fig. 1C), it failed to impair the amount of label accumulated in the presence of heparin (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that the benzothiadiazine may interfere with initiation, rather than elongative synthesis. Furthermore, similar results were obtained when using a 3-fold molar excess of poly(A) RNA to trap free polymerase in the poly(rC)-oligo(rG) RdRp assay (data not shown). In these assays, compound 1 activity was similar to that of compound4 (data not shown). To extend the above described study, a more direct assay was developed to examine initiation of RNA synthesis. Recently, Bressanelliet al. (21Bressanelli S. Tomei I. Rey F.A. DeFrancesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) identified three NTP-binding sites in the HCV RdRp: a low affinity site specific for GTP and the two nucleotide-binding sites in the active site of the RdRp (NTP1 and NTP2). To discern the mode of action for compound 4, RNA synthesis on a 17-mer RNA (5′-GCGCACAGCGCACUAAC-3′) was primed using a dinucleotide 5′-GpU-3′ as the initiation nucleotide (NTP1). NTP1 provides the 3′-hydroxyl for nucleotidyl transfer to a radiolabeled NTP (NTP2; [α-32P]UTP) as shown in Fig.2A. In the presence of both NTP1 and NTP2, a radiolabeled 3-mer RNA product is present (Fig.2B, lanes 4 and 5). This 3-mer RNA is a functional substrate for additional nucleotide incorporation, with elongative synthesis products forming after the addition of ATP (Fig. 2B, lane 3), ATP and GTP (lane 2) or all four nucleotides (lane 1). The addition of compound 4 was shown to abrogate the initial phosphodiester bond formation between 5′-GpU3-′ and radiolabeled UTP (Fig.2C, compare lane 4 with lanes 5 and6), regardless of whether ATP and CTP were present (Fig. 2C,lane 1). Furthermore, compound 4 also inhibits the addition of a second nucleotide (ATP) onto the GUU-primed RNA (Fig.2D, lanes 1–4). Taken together, these data suggest that the thiadiazines interfere directly with the process of RNA initiation and prevent initial phosphodiester bond formation prior to the commitment to elongative synthesis. Additional studies were performed using RNA LE21 (Fig.3A), to allow direct and quantitative measurement of both de novo and primer-dependent RNA synthesis within a single reaction. GTP is required for de novo initiation of LE21 RNA, and the resultant product is 21 nt (Fig. 3B, lane 1). Two molecules of LE21 can form a heteroduplex (Fig. 3A) to allow primer extension, which can occur in the absence of GTP, to generate a 34-nt product (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2) as reported by Ranjith-Kumar et al. (26Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Gutshall L. Kim M.-J. Sarisky R.T. Kao C.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12526-12536Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Multimers of 21-nt product (i.e. 42, 63, etc.) are usually observed; this is because of the end-to-end template switch (recombination) (27Kim M.-J. Kao C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4972-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Reactions without compound 4 received a mock aliquot of Me2SO to normalize for any effects of Me2SO on RNA synthesis (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). Upon the addition of 25 nmcompound 4 to the reaction (Fig. 3B, lanes 3–6), both de novo and primer-dependent RNA synthesis were inhibited by ∼397 (Fig. 3C). Significantly less inhibition was observed at a lower concentration of the heterocyclic inhibitors. As shown above, the benzothiadiazines disrupted the initiation step of RNA synthesis. It is unclear from these studies whether the heterocyclic inhibitors form a ternary complex with polymerase-bound RNA or interact preferentially with the RdRp apoenzyme prior to template binding. To address this question, (a) an RdRp assay varying the order of reagent addition, (b) filter binding studies, and (c) surface plasmon resonance studies were performed. The order of reagent addition was varied for the standard RdRp assay. Specifically, free polymerase was preincubated with RNA prior to the addition of compound 4, was preincubated with compound 4 prior to the addition of template RNA, or was used to initiate reaction for a mixture containing preincubated RNA and compound. The order of addition variation did not affect compound potency; IC50 values were 101, 102, and 110 nm, respectively (Fig.4). Hence, compound 4 did not demonstrate preferential inhibition for the apoenzyme or appear to disrupt the polymerase-RNA complex. Titration of polymerase with SLD8 RNA in the RdRp buffer showed an apparent Kd of 62 nm (Fig. 5A). Titration of compound 4 with the polymerase-RNA complex did not result in a measurable IC50, suggesting that under these conditions the heterocyclic inhibitor did not interfere with the polymerase-RNA interaction (Fig. 5B). This result was consistent with the order of addition experiment shown in Fig. 4. Compound 4 preincubated with the polymerase prior to addition of RNA or added to the polymerase-RNA mixture resulted in similar amounts of radioactivity on the membrane (data not shown). Finally, SPR studies were performed to measure more directly the potential of ternary complex formation between compound 4, RNA, and the HCV RdRp. The response difference shown in Fig. 6 corresponds to a direct measure of the change in molecular weight of the RNA tethered to the streptavidin chip surface. The differential for compound4, GTP, or the herpesvirus DNA polymerase inhibitor PFA was 0 RU, confirming that these agents alone do not bind the RNA directly under these experimental conditions. The response differential for the HCV RdRp alone or the HCV RdRp with PFA was ∼5 RU, thereby indicating that the viral polymerase is capable of binding the chip-tethered RNA and that the addition of PFA does not modulate that interaction. Thus, under these conditions PFA most likely does not interact with the RNA-bound polymerase, which is consistent with the inability of PFA to inhibit the viral RdRp in primer extension assays (data not shown). Conversely, the response differential for the RNA-bound HCV RdRp upon adding compound 4 or GTP increased to around 27 RU. This change in RU corresponds to an increase in mass on the chip, potentially indicating an increase in affinity for RNA by HCV RdRp bound to compound 4 or GTP. Taken together, these studies confirm that both GTP and compound 4 are capable of interacting directly with the RNA-bound viral RdRp. Recombinant HCV RdRp was reported to possess the ability to add nontemplated nucleotides to the 3′ end of viral RNA, referred to as terminal transferase (TNTase) activity (9Behrens S.-E. Tomei L. De Francesco R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 25Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Gajewski J.G.L. Maley D. Sarisky R.T. Kao C.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8615-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Further, this RdRp-associated activity has been implicated in maintaining the integrity of the termini of the viral RNA genome (25Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Gajewski J.G.L. Maley D. Sarisky R.T. Kao C.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8615-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because compound 4 was shown not to interfere with the formation of an enzyme-RNA complex necessary for initiation of RNA synthesis, it was evaluated for inhibition of other RdRp functions such as TNTase activity. Compound 4 was found to inhibit TNTase activity of the HCV RdRp with a potency profile equivalent to inhibition of RdRp activity (data not shown). The HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the central catalytic enzyme of replication, represents a viable target for identification of antiviral agents to treat chronic HCV infections. In this study, we report the mechanism of action for the benzothiadiazine compound 4. We describe an assay using a short RNA template to investigate the early steps of HCV RdRp-catalyzed RNA synthesis. Specifically, we have demonstrated that this HCV-selective inhibitor interferes with the initiation process of viral replication rather than with elongative RNA synthesis. The inhibition of initial phosphodiester bond formation occurs regardless of whether replication initiates via a primer-dependent or a de novomechanism. The distribution of products suggests that the RdRp initiation complex readily accumulates dinucleotides but may be inefficient in forming a productive elongative complex. This abundance of di- or trinucleotides in the gel-based assays reported herein as well as by another group (28Shim J.H. Larson G. Wu J.Z. Hong Z. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7030-7039Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) suggest that the RdRp may dissociate rapidly from the RNA template rather than transition efficiently into elongative synthesis. This process of abortive initiation is not uncommon and has been described recently for T7 RNA polymerase (29Temaikov D. Mentesana P.E. Ma K. Mustaev A. Borukhov S. McAllister W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14109-14114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 30Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3245-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 31Martin C.T.

Virology. 1996; 226: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), such that initiation complexes release short RNA templates prior to transition toward forming a stable elongative complex. This suggests that a conformational change may be inherent in this transition and that HCV may operate in a manner similar to T7 RNA polymerase. As a first attempt at understanding the dynamic process of RNA synthesis and utilizing compound 4 as a tool, several key experiments were performed. The goal was to assess whether compound4 inhibits the apoenzyme form of the viral RdRp or is capable of forming a ternary complex to mediate inhibition of RNA synthesis. The order of reagent addition studies showed no difference in the inhibition profile when preincubating the RdRp with RNA or with compound prior to initiating the reaction. These data suggest that a ternary complex may indeed form, although alternate possibilities for the mode of action cannot be directly ruled out on the basis of this data. Similar results were found using the filter binding study, suggesting that an increasing concentration of compound 4did not disrupt the ability of the RdRp to interact with RNA template. Finally, to evaluate formation of a ternary complex more directly, surface plasmon resonance was utilized. This study provided evidence that a ternary complex is capable of forming between RNA template, Δ21 HCV RdRp, and compound 4. Together, these data suggest that this heterocyclic agent interacts with both the apoenzyme form and the RNA-bound form of Δ21 HCV RdRp and does not interfere directly with RdRp-RNA interaction. The ability to interact with Δ21 HCV RdRp that is tethered to an RNA template is consistent with its inhibition in the replicon system, whereby the HCV RdRp is presumed to be membrane-bound and continually in contact with the viral RNA. Further studies using the full-length form of the viral polymerase will help provide additional insight into this inhibition profile. The TNTase activity of HCV RdRp, which is responsible for adding nucleotides to the 3′ terminus of template RNA, may directly modulate the initiation of RNA synthesis. This activity potentially could be used by RNA viruses to restore the 3′-initiation site, which may be damaged by exonucleases present in the intracellular compartments (35Irie M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 81: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Herein, we report that compound 4 disrupts both RdRp and TNTase activity of the HCV RdRp. To date, all evidence indicates that TNTase activity is a property of the viral polymerase that requires the RdRp catalytic site, and inhibition of both enzymatic activities by compound 4 is in agreement with this model. This report represents the first demonstration of an initiation inhibitor for HCV RNA synthesis. This novel mode of action would be expected to demonstrate synergy with nucleoside analogs capable of inhibiting the HCV RdRp, with the latter class of agents representing elongation inhibitors. Further investigations are ongoing to assess the potential utility of this agent in the treatment of chronic HCV disease. We thank C. Rice for the BB7 HCV replicon and C. Silverman and S.

https://openalex.org/W2003456026,"Based on our previous results indicating the presence of a tumor suppressor gene (TSG), chromosome 21 was analysed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 18 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (17, AML-M0; one, AML-M1). Allelotyping at polymorphic loci was performed on purified material, allowing unequivocal detection of allelic loss and homozygous deletions. Six AML-M0 patients shared a common region of LOH harboring a single gene: RUNX1 (AML1), the most frequent site of translocations in acute leukemia and a well-known fusion oncogene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization allowed the identification of deletions with breakpoints within RUNX1 in two patients as the cause of LOH. In the four others the LOH pattern and the presence of two karyotypically normal chromosomes 21 were in line with mitotic recombination. Further molecular and cytogenetic analyses showed that this caused homozygosity of primary RUNX1 mutations: two point mutations, a partial deletion and, most significantly, a complete deletion of RUNX1. These findings identify RUNX1 as a classical TSG: both alleles are mutated or absent in cancer cells from four of the 17 AML-M0 patients examined. In contrast to AML-M0, the AML-M1 patient was trisomic for chromosome 21 and has two mutated and one normal RUNX1 allele, suggesting that the order of mutagenic events leading to leukemia may influence the predominant tumor type."
https://openalex.org/W1974922770,"The BCL6 gene is often structurally altered and probably 'misregulated' in two different types of human B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (BNHL) thought to arise from germinal centre B cells. BCL6 encodes a BTB/POZ and zinc finger protein whose biochemical properties support a role as a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor and disclose, in part, the underlying mechanisms. In contrast, the study of the 'oncogenic' structural alterations of BCL6 in BNHL and of its cellular functions gives rise to much more heterogeneous data with no obvious unifying picture so that how and even whether BCL6 contributes to lymphomagenesis remains unclear. This review will summarize the current knowledge about the 'oncogenic' alterations and cellular functions of BCL6 and, based on some results, will propose the following hypotheses: (1) In various systems, including in memory T cells and also in germinal centre B cells and possibly in certain postmitotic cells, BCL6 may act by stabilizing a particular stage of differentiation. (2) Both its ambivalent effects on cell survival and the heterogeneous consequences of its alterations in BNHL suggest that BCL6 can be oncogenic not only upon overexpression or persistent expression, as often proposed, but also, similar to some of its relatives, upon 'accidental' downregulation."
https://openalex.org/W1979144014,"The defining characteristic of a tumor cell is its ability to escape the constraints imposed by neighboring cells, invade the surrounding tissue, and metastasize to distant sites. This invasive property of tumor cells is dependent on activation of proteases at the cell surface. Most cancer cells secrete the urokinase-type plasminogen activator, which converts cell-bound plasminogen to plasmin. Here we address the issue of whether the plasminogen binding protein, p11, plays a significant role in this process. Transfection of human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells with the human p11 gene in the antisense orientation resulted in a loss of p11 protein from the cell surface and concomitant decreases in cellular plasmin production, ECM degradation, and cellular invasiveness. The transfected cells demonstrated reduced development of lung metastatic foci in SCID mice. In contrast, HT1080 cells transfected with the p11 gene in the sense orientation displayed increased cell surface p11 protein and concomitant increases in cellular plasmin production, as well as enhanced ECM degradation and enhanced cellular invasiveness. The p11 overexpressing cells showed enhanced development of lung metastatic foci. These data establish that changes in the extracellular expression of the plasminogen receptor protein, p11, dramatically affect tumor cell-mediated pericellular proteolysis."

We investigated the potential independent properties of the remaining 16 kDa IL-1alpha amino-terminal propiece by expression in human tumor and primary human cell lines. The IL-1alpha propiece produced apoptosis in malignant but not normal cell lines. A minimal fragment comprised of amino acids 55-108 was required for apoptosis. Deletion and mutation studies identified an extended nuclear localization sequence required for nuclear localization, induction of apoptosis and concentration of the IL-1alpha propiece in interchromatin granule clusters, concentrations of proteins in the RNA splicing and processing pathways. The IL-1alpha propiece interacted with five known components of the RNA splicing/processing pathway, suggesting that the mechanism of action may involve changes in RNA splicing or processing. Expression of the IL-1alpha propiece caused a shift in the ratio of Bcl-Xl/Bcl-Xs toward the apoptotic direction. Our findings indicate that the IL-1alpha propiece induces apoptosis in a range of tumor cells and likely operates through a mechanism involving the RNA processing apparatus and the alternate splicing of apoptosis regulatory proteins."

Subsequently, it has been shown that over 95% of people older than 2 years are seropositive for HHV6 (2Braun D.K. Dominguez G. Pellett P.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 521-567Google Scholar). The primary infection with HHV6 can give rise to exanthema subitum, also known as roseola infantum or the sixth disease (2Braun D.K. Dominguez G. Pellett P.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 521-567Google Scholar). The course is generally benign, but complications such as seizures, meningitis, and encephalitis are well recognized (2Braun D.K. Dominguez G. Pellett P.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 521-567Google Scholar). HHV6 is known to establish latency in its host and to be highly neurotropic (2Braun D.K. Dominguez G. Pellett P.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 521-567Google Scholar). HHV6 has been suggested as an agent involved in multiple sclerosis (MS) (2Braun D.K. Dominguez G. Pellett P.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 521-567Google Scholar); however, the ubiquitous presence of HHV6 in the human population from an early age on combined with the frequent finding of HHV6 in the central nervous system of infected persons has made it difficult to determine whether reactivation of HHV6 in the central nervous system is in fact implicated in plaque formation in multiple sclerosis or whether the virus is just an innocent bystander (2Braun D.K. Dominguez G. Pellett P.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 521-567Google Scholar). Large DNA viruses such as poxviruses and herpesviruses encode proteins, which interfere with their host immune system. Several of these immune-evasive genes encode proteins, which target the chemokine system. Chemokines are 70–80 amino acid proteins with well characterized three-dimensional structures that are involved in attracting and activating distinct leukocyte subsets (3Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Google Scholar, 4Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176Google Scholar). The current number of endogenous human chemokine genes is approaching 50. These can be divided into four subfamilies on the basis of the pattern and number of the conserved cysteine residues located near their N termini, which are involved in disulfide binding formation. In the CC family the two N-terminal cysteines are adjacent, and in the CXC family and CX3C family the two residues are separated by a single amino acid and by three amino acids, respectively, whereas in the XC family only one cysteine is present. Chemokines act through seven-transmembrane receptors, G protein-coupled receptors of which we today know 10 CC chemokine receptors, six CXC receptors, one CX3C receptor (CX3CR1), and one XC receptor (XCR1) (4Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176Google Scholar, 5Murphy P.M. Pharmacol.

Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Google Scholar) are all known to encode chemokine-like proteins and/or chemokine receptors. For most of these receptors the function has not yet been identified, except in the case of the open reading frame 74 CXC chemokine receptor from HHV8, which apparently is crucially involved in the angiogenic lesions in Kaposi's sarcoma (11Bais C.

Thus, we found that the HHV8-encoded vMIP-II functions as a broad spectrum chemokine antagonist, whereas the MC148 chemokine encoded by the poxvirus Molluscum contagiosum is a highly selective CCR8 antagonist (16Kledal T.N.

HHV6 encodes two putative chemokine receptors and a chemokine-like protein, which based on its primary structure, is predicted to be either a CC or a CX3C chemokine (Fig.1). In the present study we show that the HHV6 U83 gene encodes a CC chemokine, which functions as a highly selective and efficacious agonist for the human CCR2 receptor both in respect of signal transduction and the ability to induce chemotaxis. In analogy with the two cytomegalovirus-encoded chemokines vCXC1 and vCXC2, we suggest that the U83 gene product be named vCCL4 because it is the fourth human herpesvirus-encoded CC chemokine to be characterized, and this name is used throughout the present paper. U83 was cloned from HHV6B DNA bought from Autogen Bioclear England into the pTej8 vector using standard techniques. The sequence of the gene was similar to GenBankTM accession number 405187. To knock-out two reported splice sites, another construct was made with two silent mutations (167TACCTG172 to167TGCCAG172 and244TACCTG249 to244TATTTG249). To purify vCCL4, the same method that had been successfully used for MC148 was applied with minor modifications. In brief COS-7 cells and CHO cells were transiently transfected with the two U83 constructs by a calcium phosphate precipitate method with addition of chloroquine. Serum- and phenol red-free medium was collected 24 h after transfection. The medium was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was adjusted to pH 9.5 and filtered through 0.22-μm filters (Nalgene, Rochester, NY). The medium was diluted with water 1:1 to decrease ionic strength and loaded on anion exchange SP-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences). The columns were washed with 20 mm ethanolamin buffer, pH 9.5, and the protein was eluted with 2 m NaCl in the same buffer. The eluate was made 0.2% in trifluoroacetic acid, filtered and loaded on a C8 (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) column for reverse-phase HPLC from where bound material was eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water on a gradient of CH3CN. We tried to identify the elution position of vCCL4 by mass spectroscopy of different protein fractions. vCCL4 (21–113 from GenBankTM NC 000898), CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, CCL13, and CCL27 were chemically synthesized as described previously (26Clark-Lewis I. Vo L. Owen P. Anderson J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 287: 233-250Google Scholar). Mass spectroscopy and HPLC of vCCL4 revealed a monomeric protein with the predicted molecular mass of 9957 Da. CXCL8 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified in-house. CCL1, CCL5, CCL11, CCL16, CXCL12, CXCL16, CX3CL1, and murine XCL1 were bought from R & D (Minneapolis, MN), whereas CCL25 and CXCL11 were bought from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). CCL20 was kindly provided by Tim Wells (Serono, Geneva, Switzerland). CCL21 and CCL22 were kindly provided by Thomas Schall (ChemoCentryx). CXCL13 was kindly provided by Bernhard Moser (Thedor-Kocher Institute, Bern, Switzerland). CCR2b and CCR8 were transfected into the murine pre-B cell line 300.19 by electroporation, and stable transfectants were obtained after limiting dilution and chemical selection with G418 and subsequently functional selection by testing the clones for calcium response to CCL2 and CCL1, respectively. Kuldeep Neote (Pfizer, Groton, CT) kindly provided 300.19 cells expressing the CXCR3 receptor, and Bernhard Moser (Thedor-Kocher Institute) kindly provided 300.19 cells expressing the CXCR5 receptor. CCR10 and CXCR6 were transfected into the murine pre-B cell line L1.2 by electroporation, and stable transfectants were obtained after limiting dilution and chemical selection with G418 and subsequently functional selection by testing the clones for calcium response to CCL27 and CXCL16, respectively. The L1.2 cell lines expressing the CCR2b, CCR3, and CCR7 receptors were established at ICOS (Seattle, WA). The L12 cells stably expressing CCR4, CCR6, XCR1, and CX3CR1 were a kind gift from Osamu Yoshie (Kinki University, Osaka, Japan). The CHO cells stably expressing CCR1, CCR2b, CCR5, CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR4 were generously provided by Tim Wells (Serono). Gabriel Marquez (Autonomous University, Madrid, Spain) kindly provided HEK293 stably expressing the CCR9 receptor. Whole cell binding (2 × 105cells/well) was performed at 4 °C for 3 h in 0.5 ml of 25 mm Hepes buffer containing 1 mmCaCl2 and 5 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.2, supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin on CHO cells stably transfected with CCR2. The incubation was stopped by washing four times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold binding buffer made 0.5 mm in NaCl. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined after extraction of the cells with 8 m urea in 3 m acetic acid supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40. Nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of the relevant chemokine peptide (0.1 μm), was subtracted. 125I-CCL2 (IM280) was obtained fromAmersham Biosciences. The cells stably transfected with various chemokine receptors were loaded with Fura-2 acetoxy methyl (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in RPMI with 1% fetal calf serum for 20–30 min, aliquots were made of 1 × 106 cells, and each aliquot was pelleted and resuspended in RPMI with 10 mm EGTA. Fluorescence was measured on a Jobin Yvon FluoroMax-2 (Jobin Yvon Spex, Edison, NJ) as the ratio of emission at 490 nm when excited at 340 and 380 nm, respectively. Chemotaxis was measured using 24-transwell polycarbonate 3-μm membranes (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA). Chemokines were diluted in 0.6 ml of chemotaxis buffer (RPMI medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and added to the lower chemotaxis chamber. 1 × 106 CCR2/L1.2 cells were resuspended in 0.1 ml of chemotaxis buffer and added to the top chamber insert. Chemotaxis plates were then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator. After the incubation the cells from the bottom well were collected and counted by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Initially we tried to express the U83 gene in transfected COS-7 and CHO cells and purify the protein on an anion exchange column and HPLC as described previously (17Luttichau H.R. Stine J. Boesen T.P. Johnsen A.H. Chantry D. Gerstoft J. Schwartz T.W. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 171-180Google Scholar), but we were unable to recover the protein. One possible explanation could be that the transcript was spliced in uninfected cells (splicing is normally silenced under viral replication), resulting in a protein truncated 8 amino acids after the CC chemokine motif (27French C. Menegazzi P. Nicholson L. Macaulay H. DiLuca D. Gompels U.A. Virology. 1999; 262: 139-151Google Scholar). Therefore two internal splice-sites were removed with silent mutations. This construct was transfected into CHO cells, but again no protein could be recovered. Using prediction servers the precursor protein of the U83 gene product was predicted to have one cleavage site for a signal peptide between residues 20 and 21, and the supposed secreted form of the viral chemokine was produced synthetically. This predicted N terminus was identical to the one reported from a group, who expressed a fusion construct of the U83 and a IgG gene in mammalian cells and did amino acid sequence analysis of the purified protein (28Zou P. Isegawa Y. Nakano K. Haque M. Horiguchi Y. Yamanishi K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5926-5933Google Scholar). The synthetic vCCL4 protein was used for receptor activation studies, receptor binding studies, and chemotaxis assays. To screen for a possible interaction of vCCL4 with the known chemokine receptors, vCCL4 was probed in calcium mobilization assays on a panel of cell lines individually expressing the 18 known human chemokine receptors. Initially, 1 μm of vCCL4 was used in these assays. vCCL4 was unable to elicit a calcium response through 17 of the 18 human chemokine receptors. However, in 300.19 cells stably transfected with CCR2, vCCL4 gave a robust calcium response similar in magnitude to the response elicited by CCL2, the major endogenous CCR2 ligand. The same concentration of vCCL4 was for example unable to induce a calcium response in CX3CR1 L12-transfected cells, indicating that the U83 gene product is indeed a CC chemokine. In contrast, vCCL4 was not able to induce a calcium response in 300.19 cells stably transfected with for example CXCR3 and CXCR5 (Fig. 2), showing that the effect was mediated through CCR2 and not an endogenous receptor in 300.19 cells. 2For example 300.19 cells are known to express an endogenous CXCR4 receptor. vCCL4 did not act as an antagonist on any of the tested human chemokine receptors because pretreatment of the cell lines with vCCL4 was unable to inhibit or block the response to the relevant endogenous chemokine through any of the human chemokine receptors tested as seen in (Fig. 2). However, in the CCR2-transfected 300.19 cells a diminished response to CCL2 was observed after pretreatment with 1 μm of vCCL4 (Fig. 2). This inhibitory effect is due to specific desensitization (see below). To characterize the affinity of vCCL4 and compare this affinity with known endogenous human CCR2 ligands, we did binding studies on CHO cells stably transfected with the CCR2 receptor using125I-CCL2 (Fig. 3). vCCL4 displaced 125I-CCL2 from the CCR2 receptor with an affinity of 79 nm. In contrast, the endogenous human CCR2 ligands all belonging to the proteins in the previously designated monocyte chemoattractant protein family of chemokines bound the receptor with higher affinity. Thus, the IC50 values were 0.08 nm for CCL2, 3.1 nm for CCL7, 2.7 nm for CCL8, and 2.2 nm for CCL13. CCL11 was found to have a comparable affinity of 72 nm, whereas the affinity of CCL16 was higher (>100 nm; data not shown). As shown in Fig. 41 μm of vCCL4 induced a maximal calcium response through CCR2 in stably transfected 300.19 cells. In these cells CCL2 was found to have an EC50 of 0.7 nm, whereas the EC50values were 2.2 nm for CCL7, 15.4 nm for CCL8, 8.2 nm for CCL13, and 156 nmfor the HHV6-encoded vCCL4, values that correlated well with the affinities found in binding experiments in the CCR2-transfected CHO cells. As shown in Fig. 4, vCCL4 was able to cross-desensitize the response of 1 nm of CCL2 and vice versa, indicating that the effect of vCCL4 is indeed mediated through the common CCR2 receptor. The chemotactic activity of vCCL4 was compared with that of the endogenous human chemokines from the monocyte chemoattractant protein family in the murine pre-B lymphocyte cell line L1.2 stably transfected with the human CCR2 receptor (Fig. 5). The endogenous chemokines demonstrated different patterns with respect to both efficacy and potency. Thus, CCL2 and to a certain degree also CCL7 both showed high potency and high efficacy, whereas CCL13 had a poor potency and a rather poor efficacy, and CCL8, although it is of rather high potency, showed a very limited efficacy. All of the endogenous chemokines demonstrated the classical bell-shaped dose-response curve in the chemotactic experiments (Fig. 5). Surprisingly the efficacy of vCCL4 was very high, and in fact it is unclear whether the maximal response was even reached with the available amount of the virally encoded protein (Fig. 5). The chemotactic response to vCCL4 was at least as high as that of CCL2 and CCL7 and much higher than that of CCL13 and CCL8. In the present study we find that the chemokine-like protein product of the U83 gene from HHV6B vCCL4 acts as a highly efficacious but relatively low potency agonist for the human CCR2 receptor. Thus, the virally encoded chemokine could serve a role initially in the infectious life cycle of the virus by attracting, for example, macrophages and monocytes, which express the CCR2 receptor, to infect and establish latency in them. During reactivation of latent virus in monocyte-derived microglia in the central nervous system, vCCL4 could be involved in the pathogenesis of MS, which at least in experimental animals is known to be totally dependent on the presence of a functional CCR2 receptor (29Fife B.T. Huffnagle G.B. Kuziel W.A. Karpus W.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 899-905Google Scholar, 30Izikson L. Klein R.S. Charo I.F. Weiner H.L. Luster A.D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1075-1080Google Scholar). The vCCL4 protein has very limited homology with the known human chemokines; however, it is clearly a chemokine protein because it has the required disulfide pattern (Fig. 1). The notion that vCCL4 has a very long N-terminal extension of 27 amino acid residues is particularly interesting because often important structural epitopes related to receptor activation are located in the N-terminal extension of chemokines. Thus, the N-terminal of vCCL4 lacks the glutamine in the first position that is conserved among all human endogenous CCR2 ligands and when missing has been found to reduce the biological activity of for example CCL2 100–1000-fold (31Zhang Y.J. Rutledge B.J. Rollins B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15918-15924Google Scholar, 32Gong J.H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Google Scholar). Moreover, a potential glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding epitope, BBXB (B being a basic residue) (33Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 156-167Google Scholar), is found right before the third Cys residue, which very likely forms a disulfide bridge back to the first Cys of the protein. This location would place the GAG-binding epitope in a loop region conceivably optimally exposed for interaction with GAGs in the tissue. It is in fact very likely that vCCL4 is a good GAG-binding chemokine because it has an additional potential basic pair located in the opposite end of the canonical three-dimensional structure of the molecule. Most studies with CCR2 ligands have been done on primary cells especially monocytes. So when comparing data it is important to bear in mind that primary cells express multiple chemokine receptors and that the CCR2 ligands CCL7, CCL8, and CCL13 can activate CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 in addition to CCR2. Other groups using CCR2-transfected cells have found binding affinities of the four members of the monocyte chemoattractant protein family in the nanomolar range, which are in agreement with our results (34Berkhout T.A. Sarau H.M. Moores K. White J.R. Elshourbagy N. Appelbaum E. Reape R.J. Brawner M. Makwana J. Foley J.J. Schmidt D.B. Imburgia C. McNulty D. Matthews J. O'Donnell K. O'Shannessy D. Scott M. Groot P.H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11682-11685Google Scholar) except that we found CCL2 to have an affinity in the subnanomolar range, which probably is due to cell line and assay differences. The finding that CCL8 and CCL13 were unable displace all bound 125I-CCL2 from CCR2 are known from other binding studies on monocytes and CCR2-transfected cell lines (35Gong X. Gong W. Kuhns D.B. Ben Baruch A. Howard O.M. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11682-11685Google Scholar, 36Yamagami S. Tanaka H. Endo N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 329-332Google Scholar, 37Sozzani S. Zhou D. Locati M.

Schwiebert L.M. Bickel C. Liu M. Bochner B.S. Williams T. Schleimer R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 926-936Google Scholar), where one group even reported increasing binding of 125I-CCL2 with increasing concentrations of CCL8 (36Yamagami S. Tanaka H. Endo N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 329-332Google Scholar), a phenomenon known from other chemokines in binding assays and that probably is due to fact that certain chemokines tend to oligomerize (39Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Google Scholar). The potencies in chemotaxis for CCL2, CCL7, and CCL13 were in agreement with another study using a CCR2-transfected 300.19 murine pre-B cell line (38Stellato C. Collins P. Ponath P.D. Soler D. Newman W. La Rosa G. Li H. White J. Schwiebert L.M. Bickel C. Liu M. Bochner B.S. Williams T. Schleimer R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 926-936Google Scholar). Why does HHV6 specifically target the CCR2 receptor? In this connection it should be noted that a herpesvirus, in addition to having the capacity to generate a productive infection, should be able to establish latency in certain cell types, where it can hide from the immune system waiting for the moment, when it will be reactivated. HHV6 can replicate in several cell types, for example T cells and macrophages/monocytes (2Braun D.K. Dominguez G. Pellett P.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 521-567Google Scholar), and HHV6 can be recovered from macrophages from normal adult human beings, indicating that HHV6 establishes latency in this cell type (40Kondo K. Kondo T. Okuno T. Takahashi M. Yamanishi K. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 1401-1408Google Scholar). CCR2 is known to be expressed on macrophages and lymphocytes (4Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176Google Scholar). Thus, it could be speculated that HHV6 has optimized vCCL4 to attract T cells and macrophages/monocytes, to infect them, and to establish latency at least in the monocyte/macrophage lineage. It is interesting that human immunodeficiency virus seems to have chosen the same strategy to exploit the chemokine system as the human immunodeficiency virus-encoded Tat protein when it acts as a CCR2 agonist capable of attracting monocytes and thereby favor rapid spread of infection (41Albini A. Ferrini S. Benelli R. Sforzini S. Giunciuglio D. Aluigi M.G. Proudfoot A.E. Alouani S. Wells T.N. Mariani G. Rabin R.L. Farber J.M. Noonan D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13153-13158Google Scholar). vCCL4 appears to be a highly efficacious but relatively low potency agonist for CCR2. Obviously, the potency of a ligand should be compared with the actual available concentrations of the ligand, which for vCCL4 at present is unknown but could be considerable locally around a HHV6-infected cell because of a potential highly efficient expression and the potential efficient GAG binding, which is discussed above. In a previous study Zou and co-workers (28Zou P. Isegawa Y. Nakano K. Haque M. Horiguchi Y. Yamanishi K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5926-5933Google Scholar) found that a protein consisting of the U83 chemokine domain fused to an IgG molecule was biologically active because this molecule could induce chemotaxis and calcium mobilization in the monocytic THP-1 cell line. The THP-1 cells are known to express at least the CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, and CX3CR1 chemokine receptors, and no attempt was done in that study to identify the specific target receptor for the U83 gene product (42Xu L. Rahimpour R. Ran L. Kong C. Biragyn A. Andrews J. Devries M. Wang J.M. Kelvin D.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 653-660Google Scholar, 43Raport C.J. Schweickart V.L. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Gray P.W. Gene. 1995; 163: 295-299Google Scholar). The present study indicates that the fusion protein conceivably acted through CCR2 receptors on the THP-1 cells. Despite its high efficacy, it is still puzzling that the HHV6-encoded chemokine has 25–1000-fold less affinity compared with the endogenous human ligands. In general it is not uncommon that viral homologues of cytokines have less affinity than their endogenous mammalian counterparts. This is the case for example for the HHV8-encoded viral chemokine vMIP-III, which has been characterized to be a low affinity CCR4 agonist (19Stine J.T. Wood C. Hill M. Epp A. Raport C.J. Schweickart V.L. Endo Y. Sasaki T. Simmons G. Boshoff C. Clapham P. Chang Y. Moore P. Gray P.W. Chantry D. Blood. 2000; 95: 1151-1157Google Scholar). Also the EBV-encoded IL-10 homologue has a 1000-fold less affinity to the human IL-10 receptor than endogenous IL-10 (44Liu Y. de Waal M.R. Briere F. Parham C. Bridon J.M. Banchereau J. Moore K.W. Xu J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 604-613Google Scholar), and the HHV8-encoded IL-6 homologue has a 10-fold less affinity to the human IL-6 receptor than endogenous IL-6 (45Osborne J. Moore P.S. Chang Y. Hum. Immunol. 1999; 60: 921-927Google Scholar). Similarly, poxvirus homologues of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) have 10–1000-fold lower affinity to the EGF receptor than endogenous EGF (46Tzahar E. Moyer J.D. Waterman H. Barbacci E.G. Bao J. Levkowitz G. Shelly M. Strano S. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Pierce J.H. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5948-5963Google Scholar). Importantly, in the latter study the viral EGF homologues were in respect of mitogenic activity even more potent than their mammalian counterparts because of attenuation of receptor degradation leading to a sustained signal transduction. These results underline the point that viral homologues of human gene products can be significantly different from their human counterparts not just quantitatively but also qualitatively. MS is regarded as an autoimmune disease with a likely environmental trigger (47Compston A. Coles A. Lancet. 2002; 359: 1221-1231Google Scholar). Many viral candidates have been suggested during the years as being involved in MS. In recent years HHV6 has attracted much attention as the virus is neurotropic and in a number of studies and reports has been linked to MS. For example, strong IgM responses to HHV6 have been detected in MS patients (48Soldan S.S. Berti R. Salem N. Secchiero P. Flamand L. Calabresi P.A. Brennan M.B. Maloni H.W. McFarland H.F. Lin H.C.

Stewart P.M. Nowinski R.C. Brown J.P. Burmes G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7440-7444Google Scholar), and clinical cases have been reported where active HHV6 infection was closely associated with demyelinative disease (51Carrigan D.R. Harrington D. Knox K.K. Neurology. 1996; 47: 145-148Google Scholar, 52Kamei A. Ichinohe S. Onuma R. Hiraga S. Fujiwara T. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1997; 156: 709-712Google Scholar, 53Balashov K.E. Rottman J.B. Weiner H.L. Hancock W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6873-6878Google Scholar). Importantly, experiments have shown that mice deleted for CCR2, in contrast to mice deleted for CCR5, are resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (29Fife B.T. Huffnagle G.B. Kuziel W.A. Karpus W.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 899-905Google Scholar, 30Izikson L. Klein R.S. Charo I.F. Weiner H.L. Luster A.D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1075-1080Google Scholar, 54Tran E.H. Kuziel W.A. Owens T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1410-1415Google Scholar). Thus, it could be speculated that when HHV6 residing latently in the central nervous system is reactivated, vCCL4 is produced, and CCR2 expressing lymphocytes and macrophages are recruited. In this way HHV6 could be one factor among others in the generation of the autoimmune response seen in MS. The identification of vCCL4 in active plaques with immunohistochemistry and the development of vCCL4 transgenic mice could help to clarify these questions.

https://openalex.org/W2068009707,"Local cooling protects against TNF-alpha-induced injury by attenuating inflammation-associated microcirculatory dysfunction and leukocytic response. Mechanisms of protection, however, are not fully understood. We studied whether the metabolites of the HO and NOS pathway, exerting potent vasodilatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties, are involved in tissue cryoprotection. In animals pretreated with L-NAME or SnPP-IX, cooling-associated abrogation of TNF-alpha-induced microcirculatory dysfunction was abolished. Combined L-NAME/SnPP-IX pretreatment did not cause greater blunting than seen when each mediator system was inhibited separately. In SnPP-IX- but not L-NAME-pretreated animals, transient hypothermia failed to reduce TNF-alpha-mediated leukocyte adherence. Vice versa, treatment of TNF-alpha-exposed animals with either the NO donor l-arginine or the HO-1 inductor hemin mimicked cooling-associated tissue protection except for failure of l-arginine to abrogate the inflammatory leukocyte response. The efficiency of cooling to inhibit TNF-alpha-induced apoptotic cell death was blunted in SnPP-IX-, L-NAME-, and SnPP-IX/L-NAME-pretreated animals. Coadministration of Trolox in SnPP-IX-treated animals partly attenuated leukocyte adherence and cell apoptosis, implying that the HO pathway metabolite biliverdin contributes to the salutary effects of cooling. Thus, our study provides evidence that metabolites of the HO and the NOS pathway mediate the cooling-associated protection of inflamed tissue. Biliverdin rather than CO and NO mediates the anti-inflammatory action, whereas a coordinated function of the gaseous monoxides prevents microcirculatory dysfunction and apoptotic cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1969863269,"Telomere shortening induces a nonproliferative senescent phenotype, believed to reduce cancer risk, and telomeres are involved in a poorly understood manner in responses to DNA damage. Although telomere disruption induces p53 and triggers apoptosis or cell cycle arrest, the features of the disrupted telomere that trigger this response and the precise mechanism involved are poorly understood. Using human cells, we show that DNA oligonucleotides homologous to the telomere 3' overhang sequence specifically induce and activate p53 and activate an S phase checkpoint by modifying the Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein, known to mediate the S phase checkpoint after DNA damage. These responses are mediated, at least in part, by the ATM kinase and are not attributable to disruption of cellular telomeres. Based on these and earlier data, we propose that these oligonucleotides mimic a physiological signal, exposure of the telomere 3' overhang due to opening of the normal telomere loop structure, and hence evoke these protective antiproliferative responses in the absence of DNA damage or telomere disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2015770887,"Mammalian STE20-like kinase 2 (MST2), a member of the STE20-like kinase family, has been shown in previous studies to undergo proteolytic activation by caspase-3 during cell apoptosis. A few studies have also implicated protein phosphorylation reactions in MST2 regulation. In this study, we examined the mechanism of MST2 regulation with an emphasis on the relationship between caspase-3 cleavage and protein phosphorylation. Both the full-length MST2 and the caspase-3-truncated form of MST2 overexpressed in 293T cells exist in a phosphorylated state. On the other hand, the endogenous full-length MST2 from rat thymus or from proliferating cells is mainly unphosphorylated whereas the caspase-3-truncated endogenous MST2 from apoptotic cells is highly phosphorylated. Cell transfection studies using mutant MST2 constructs indicate that MST2 depends on the autophosphorylation of a unique threonine residue, Thr180, for kinase activity. The autophosphorylation reaction shows strong dependence on MST2 concentration suggesting that it is an intermolecular reaction. While both the full-length MST2 and the caspase-3-truncated form of MST2 undergo autophosphorylation, the two forms of the phosphorylated MST2 display marked difference in susceptibility to protein phosphatases. The full-length phospho-MST2 is rapidly dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1 or protein phosphatase 2A whereas the truncated MST2 is remarkably resistant to the dephosphorylation. Based on the present results, a novel molecular mechanism for MST2 regulation in apoptotic cells is postulated. In normal cells, because of the low concentration and the ready reversal of the autophosphorylation by protein phosphatases, MST2 is present mainly in the unphosphorylated and inactive state.

The activation of MST1 or MST2 during apoptosis is generally attributed to the production of an active fragment of the kinase in a caspase-3-catalyzed reaction (7Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E.

Both MST1 and MST2 undergo phosphorylation in cells but the mechanism of the enzyme regulation by protein phosphorylation is not entirely clear. A number of studies have suggested that protein phosphorylation is accompanied with an activation of the kinase. Using a phosphorylation site-specific antibody, Lee and Yonehara (16Lee K.K. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12351-12358Google Scholar) have shown that MST in okadaic acid-treated cells is phosphorylated at a site in the kinase activation loop. The observation suggests that the kinase is activated upon protein phosphorylation. In agreement with such a suggestion, Graves et al. (17Graves J.D. Draves K.E. Gotoh Y. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14909-14915Google Scholar) have shown that treatment of the extracts of anti-Fas-treated BJAB cells by protein phosphatase 2A markedly reduced the kinase activity of MST1. On the other hand, evidence suggesting an inhibitory protein phosphorylation mechanism for MST1 has also been reported (3Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Google Scholar). The present study examines the regulation of the MST2 kinase activity in detail. Both the native form and the caspase-3-truncated form of MST2 depend on autophosphorylation of a unique threonine residue, Thr180, for kinase activity. The autophosphorylation is an intermolecular reaction, showing strong dependence on the enzyme concentration. Whereas the phosphorylation of the native MST2 can be readily reversed by protein phosphatases, the truncated phospho-MST2 is resistant to protein phosphatases. On the basis of these results, a novel molecular mechanism involving caspase-3 cleavage, MST2 autophosphorylation, and protein phosphatase reaction is postulated to account for the regulation of MST2 activity in normal and apoptotic cells. Expression constructs of rat MST2 were generated as NH2-terminal Myc-tagged forms using pCMV-Myc vector obtained from Clontech (BD Biosciences). Caspase-3-truncated MST2 (TF-MST2) was constructed by introducing a stop codon after amino acid 322 using PCR amplification. Substitution of Thr180, Thr117, and Thr384 by alanine as well as Lys56 by arginine, was performed with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. HeLa and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum and 100 unit/ml penicillin-streptomysin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 57 CO2. Transient transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated for 24 h before harvesting. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 2 mmDTT, 0.17 Nonidet P-40, 0.1 ॖm microcystin-LR (MCT) (Calbiochem), 20 mm ॆ-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and the protease inhibitor mixture, CompleteTM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 2 ml of MST2 antibodies were dialyzed against the cross-linking buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 mNa2HPO4, pH 7.2) overnight. Then the antibodies were diluted with the antibody binding/washing buffer (50 mm sodium borate, pH 8.2) in a 1:1 ratio and incubated with 1 ml of pre-equilibrated protein A/G-agarose beads (A/G in 1:1 ratio, 507 slurry, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with the antibody binding/washing buffer, the beads were incubated with 10 mg of disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) for 1 h, which was dissolved in 1 ml of Me2SO then diluted with 1.5 ml of cross-linking buffer. After extensive washing with the antibody binding/washing buffer, 2 ml of blocking buffer (0.1m ethanolamine, pH 8.2) was applied to the beads and mixed for 15 min. The beads were then washed with 5 ml of elution buffer (0.1m glycine-HCl, pH 2.8) to remove the uncross-linked antibodies, and further washed with the binding/washing buffer. Finally the protein A/G beads cross-linking with MST2 antibodies were equilibrated with lysis buffer for later MST2 immunoprecipitation. For Myc-tagged protein immunoprecipitation, the transfected cell lysates (30 ॖg) were incubated with anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibody at 4 °C for 2 h or overnight in the presence of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (A/G in 1:1 ratio). For MST2 immunoprecipitation, thymus extracts or cell lysates were incubated with MST2 antibody cross-linked to protein A/G-agarose beads. After extensive washing, the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.17 Tween 20) with 57 skim milk or 37 bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h. After further washing with TBST buffer, the blot was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences). The following phospho-antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology: anti-phosphothreonine polyclonal antibody (Anti-P-Thr Ab, catalog number 9381), phospho-(Ser/Thr) kinase substrate antibody sampler kit (catalog number 9920), including phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrate antibody, phospho-(Ser) PKC substrate antibody, phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate antibody, phospho-(Thr) MAPK/CDK substrate monoclonal antibody, and phospho-(Thr) PDK1 substrate antibody. Anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (H-250) polyclonal antibody, anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10), and polyclonal antibody (A-14) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Anti-MST2 antibody was raised in rabbit against an NH2-terminal peptide (EQPPAPKSKLKKLSCys) of rat MST2 by our laboratory. The MST2 kinase was assayed using cdc2(6–20)F15K19 synthetic peptide as a substrate. The reaction mixture comprised 0.1 ॖm MCT, 0.1 mm ATP, and 0.3 ॖCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 0.5 mmsynthetic peptide substrate in 1× kinase assay buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ॆ-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm sodium fluoride). The kinase reaction was started by the addition of ATP and carried out for 30 min at 30 °C except for indications in specific experiments. The reaction was terminated by the addition of a half-assay volume of 507 trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min and 2/3 volume of the supernatant was analyzed for phosphate incorporation using P81 paper as described (18Litwin C.M.E. Cheng H. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2557-2666Google Scholar). Myc-tagged FL-MST2 and TF-MST2 were immunoprecipitated by anti-Myc (9E10) antibody. After extensive washing with the dephosphorylation buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmMnCl2), the immunoprecipitates were incubated with PP1 (0.2 unit/reaction, Calbiochem) in dephosphorylation buffer for 30 min at 30 °C, then washed by phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to Western blotting analysis. The immunoprecipitates incubated with dephosphorylation buffer without PP1 served as control. All of the purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Rat thymus (5 g) was homogenized with 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 5 mm NaF, 207 glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 ॖm MCT, 20 mm ॆ-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2× CompleteTMprotease inhibitor mixture). The homogenate was first centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The 100,000 ×g supernatant was diluted with a double volume of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF) with inhibitor mixture (1× CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture, 0.1 ॖmMCT, 20 mm ॆ-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm DTT, and 107 glycerol), and then applied to a 35-ml DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed followed by elution with 200 ml of buffer B with 0–0.5 m linear NaCl gradient. MST2 was eluted in fractions with 0.075–0.1 m NaCl gradient (total 5 fractions, 5 ml/fraction), and each fraction (∼9 mg of protein) was concentrated with Centricon 30 (Amincon) to 0.2 ml and loaded onto the FPLC Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column, respectively (Amersham Biosciences). The column was pre-equilibrated and run with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA, 0.01 ॖm Microcystin-LR, 0.1× CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture). The kinase containing fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-MST2 antibody. The full-length (FL-MST2) and the caspase-3-truncated form of MST2 (TF-MST2) were subcloned into pCMV-Myc vector and transfected into 293T cells, the cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-Myc antibody, an anti-MST2 antibody, or an anti-phosphothreonine antibody. As shown in Fig.1A (left panel), the two forms of MST2 were expressed to similar levels in 293T cells. Using an anti-MST2 antibody, we found that the levels of the transfected enzymes were at least 100-fold higher than that of the endogenous MST2 (results not shown). Both the transfected FL-MST2 and TF-MST2 existed in a phosphorylated state as judged by the anti-phosphothreonine blot (Fig. 1A, right panel). The phosphorylation of MST2 underwent rapid dephosphorylation upon cell lysis unless a phosphatase inhibitor, MCT was added to the lysis buffer, which preserved the phosphorylated MST2 for more than 6 h after cell lysis (Fig.1B). In a dose-dependent assay, 0.1 ॖm MCT was found to be effective in keeping MST2 in a phosphorylated form (Fig. 1C). For experiments described in this report, the lysis buffer routinely contained 0.1 ॖmMCT unless indicated otherwise. To determine the kinase activity of the full-length and the caspase-3-truncated forms of MST2 overexpressed in the cells, cell lysates containing equal amounts of the two forms of MST2, as judged by Western blotting analysis, were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then assayed for MST2 kinase activity. Fig. 1D shows that both the full-length and the truncated MST2 were active when the kinase dead mutant K56R served as an inactive control. However, the truncated form consistently displayed 2–3-fold higher kinase activity than the full-length MST2. In addition to MST2, a few other phosphorylated bands were revealed in the lysates of MST2-transfected cells by the anti-phosphothreonine immunoblot (Fig. 1A, right panel). For example, two phosphorylated bands of 46 and 48 kDa were consistently observed in the lysates of cells transfected with either the full-length MST2 or the truncated MST2. Another phosphorylated band migrating at 90 kDa was only observed in lysates of cells transfected with the truncated MST2 but not the full-length MST2. These proteins may represent downstream targets of MST2. Although phosphorylation of MST1 and MST2 has been shown previously, the protein kinase responsible for the phosphorylation is not known. In an attempt to determine the kinase catalyzing MST2 phosphorylation, a set of antibodies against the phosphorylated substrate sites of various protein kinases including PKA, Akt, PKC, MAPK/CDK, and PDK1 were tested for the ability to react with MST2. Among the antibodies tested, the anti-phospho-PKA substrate and anti-phospho-Akt substrate antibodies reacted with MST2 (results not shown). However, co-transfection of a constitutively active Akt with MST2 or treating the MST2-transfected cell culture with dibutyryl-cAMP had no effect on the phosphorylation of MST2 suggesting that neither kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of MST2 in the cells (data not shown). Although neither PKA nor Akt was the kinase catalyzing the phosphorylation of Myc-MST2, the recognition of MST2 by antibodies specific for phospho-substrates of PKA and Akt suggested that MST2 was phosphorylated at a site conforming to the phosphorylation motifs of these protein kinases. Three threonine residues, Thr117, Thr180, and Thr384, in MST2 appeared to reside at sites conforming to the consensus phosphorylation motifs of PKA or Akt. To investigate whether or not they are the true phosphorylation sites in MST2, we generated mutant constructs of both the full-length and the caspase-3-truncated MST2 with three sites individually mutated: T117A, T180A, and T384A. The mutant constructs were transfected into 293T cells and the cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using the anti-phosphothreonine antibody. Fig.2A shows that the phosphorylation was markedly reduced in the full-length MST2 (T180A) mutant and it was completely eliminated in the truncated MST2 (T180A) mutant. In contrast, mutating Thr117 had little or no effect on MST2 phosphorylation. Direct kinase assays using the anti-Myc immunoprecipitates also showed that T180A mutants were inactive whereas T117A mutant had approximately the same kinase activity as the wild type MST2 (Fig. 2B). Similar to the T117A mutant, mutating T384A mutant had little effect on MST2 phosphorylation and kinase activity (results not shown). These results suggest that MST2 depends on the phosphorylation of Thr180 for kinase activity. The observation that the full-length MST2 (T180A) but not the truncated MST2 (T180A) was still phosphorylated, albeit at a much lower level than the wild type MST2, suggests the existence of additional phosphorylation site(s) in the caspase-3-cleaved carboxyl-terminal region of the kinase. To test the possibility that the phosphorylation of MST2 is an autocatalytic reaction, a kinase dead mutant construct, MST2 (K56R), was transfected into 293T cells and the phosphorylation of the overexpressed protein analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig.2A, the phosphorylation of the mutant MST2 was much lower than that of the wild type MST2. Significantly, the levels of phosphorylation of MST2 (T180A) and MST2 (K56R) were almost identical. The results suggest that the phosphorylation of Thr180 of MST2 is catalyzed by an autophosphorylation reaction whereas the phosphorylation of the additional site(s) in the carboxyl-terminal region of MST2 was catalyzed by another protein kinase(s). To find out whether MST2 undergoes autophosphorylation and autoactivation, we have undertaken a detailed characterization of the MST2 phosphorylation reaction. Cultured 293T cells with overexpressed FL-MST2 were lysed in the lysis buffer containing no MCT to allow dephosphorylation of the phospho-Myc-MST2 (see Fig. 1B). After immunoprecipitation of MST2 using an anti-Myc antibody, the protein phosphorylation state and the kinase activity of the enzyme were examined. Western blot analysis indicated that MST2 in the immunoprecipitates was almost totally devoid of reactivity toward the anti-phosphothreonine antibody. However, the enzyme exhibited significant kinase activity (Fig.3A). The observation suggests that the unphosphorylated MST2 may undergo autophosphorylation during the kinase assay. To determine whether or not MST2 is phosphorylated during the course of the kinase assay, aliquots of the MST2 reaction were withdrawn at intervals and analyzed for both the substrate phosphorylation (i.e. the kinase activity) and MST2 phosphorylation. Fig.3B shows that MST2 was indeed phosphorylated during the course of the kinase reaction. The increase in MST2 phosphorylation was obvious right from the beginning of the time course and continued throughout the entire course of 20 min. As a control, phospho-MST2 immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates containing MCT was also analyzed and the result indicates that it could be further phosphorylated. The time course of the substrate phosphorylation (Fig.3A) by dephosphorylated MST2 (in lysates without MCT) displays an upward curvature with a pronounced initial lag suggesting an increase in enzyme activity during the course of the reaction. A slight curvature can also be detected in the time course of the control reaction, but the initial lag is not apparent. These results provide strong support to the suggestion that MST2 depends on phosphorylation for kinase activity. To further test whether the MST2 autophosphorylation was an intermolecular or intramolecular reaction, the dependence of the protein phosphorylation on MST2 concentration was characterized. Cultured 293T cells containing overexpressed MST2 were lysed in the absence of MCT, the lysates were further incubated at 4 °C for 1 h to ensure that MST2 was mostly dephosphorylated. The cell lysates were then diluted with the lysis buffer to different protein concentrations, and the phosphorylation was started at 22 °C with the supplement of ATP and Mg2+. Three minutes after the start of the phosphorylation reaction, SDS loading buffer was added to stop the reaction. The samples were then analyzed by Western blot using the anti-phosphothreonine antibody. Lysates with a wide range of cellular protein concentrations, from 0.03 to 1 mg/ml, were used in the phosphorylation reactions. A very short reaction time, 3 min, was used in hoping that the phosphorylation could reflect the initial rate of the reaction. As shown in Fig. 4, although equal amounts of cellular proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis, the level of MST2 phosphorylation differed depending on the protein concentration in the phosphorylation reaction. The level of MST2 phosphorylation increased with the protein concentration in the phosphorylation reaction. Densitometric analysis of the immunoblot indicates that the level of MST2 phosphorylation at 0.03 mg/ml was less than 17 that at 1 mg/ml. The observation suggests that autophosphorylation of MST2 is through intermolecular but not intramolecular reaction. The observation that autophosphorylation of MST2 shows strong dependence on the enzyme concentration has raised the possibility that the state of phosphorylation of the overexpressed MST2 did not reflect the phosphorylation state of the endogenous MST2. To address such a possibility, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of the endogenous MST2 from rat thymus. Rat thymus contains relatively high amounts of MST2 that could be enriched readily on a DEAE ion exchange chromatography column. The endogenous MST2 in rat thymus was purified using DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column chromatography followed by FPLC Superose 6 gel filtration column chromatography. Fractions eluted from the gel filtration column were pooled and subjected to immunoprecipitation by an anti-MST2 antibody, which was cross-linked to protein A/G-agarose beads by disuccinimidyl suberate as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 The cross-linked antibodies could not be released from the agarose beads during boiling in the SDS loading buffer, thus the immunoprecipitated MST2 that has a similar mobility as IgGs could be detected clearly by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A, the immunoprecipitates of partially purified thymus MST2 fractions displayed intense immunostain by the anti-MST2 antibody, but very faint signals by the anti-phosphothreonine antibody. The lack of staining could not be attributed to low reactivity to the anti-phosphothreonine antibody because the control sample of Myc-MST2 from cell lysates with MCT was intensely stained. Like the recombinant MST2 from the transfected 293T cells, the rat thymus MST2 has kinase activity (data not shown). Analysis of MST2 in the kinase reactions by Western blot showed that MST2 phosphorylation was significantly increased at the end of the reaction (Fig. 5B). Therefore the kinase activity may be attributed to the enzyme autoactivation during the course of the enzyme assay. The observation indicates the endogenous MST2 is capable of autophosphorylation and autoactivation. Similar to thymus MST2, the endogenous MST2 from 293T cells exists mainly in the unphosphorylated state (Fig. 5A). Because MST1/2 has been documented to undergo activation during cell apoptosis, we examined the phosphorylation status of MST2 in anisomycin-induced apoptotic HeLa cells. Anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, strongly activates JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK and it is also known to induce apoptosis in several mammalian cells (19Hazalin C.A. Le Panse R. Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1844-1854Google Scholar). HeLa cells were treated with 20 ॖg/ml anisomycin for 6 h to render a portion of cells detached from the plates. The attached and detached cells, referred to as the adherent and floating cells, respectively, were separately collected and lysed as described in the legend of Fig.6. Western blotting analysis of the cell lysates showed that a significant portion of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a known substrate of caspase-3, was converted to the capase-3-cleaved form, an 85-kDa protein species. Although the cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase could be detected in the anisomycin-treated adherent HeLa cells, the majority of the cleaved PAPR was found in the floating cells (Fig. 6A). The observation indicates that anisomycin treatment could induce the caspase-3-mediated apoptosis in HeLa cells and the floating cells comprise mainly apoptotic cells. To determine the phosphorylation states of MST2 in anisomycin-induced apoptotic cells, MST2 in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-MST2 antibody and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting analysis using both the anti-MST2 antibody and the anti-phosphothreonine antibody. Western blotting of MST2 showed that a significant amount of MST2 in lysates of anisomycin-treated floating cells was cleaved and displayed as two closely spaced SDS-PAGE bands corresponding to ∼34- or 36-kDa proteins. Both cleaved MST2 bands reacted with anti-phosphothreonine antibody, whereas the full-length MST2 displayed no such reactivity (Fig. 6B). The full-length and the cleaved MST2 species were present predominantly in the adherent and floating cells, respectively (Fig. 6B). The observation, in agreement with early studies (7Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K.M. Wright M. Chernof J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Google Scholar, 8Lee K.K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Yonehara S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3029-3037Google Scholar, 11Watabe M. Kakeya H. Osada H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5211-5220Google Scholar, 12Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4888-4894Google Scholar, 13Watabe M. Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8766-8771Google Scholar), suggests that MST2 is cleaved by caspase-3 in apoptotic cells. Although the same amount of protein lysates from the adherent and floating cells was used for Western blotting analysis, the amount of MST2 was significantly lower in the floating cells than in the adherent cells. Unlike MST1, there is only one caspase-3 cleavage site in MST2 (15Lee K.K. Ohyama T. Yajima N. Tsubuki S. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19276-19285Google Scholar, 17Graves J.D. Draves K.E. Gotoh Y. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14909-14915Google Scholar); the reason for the existence of two SDS-PAGE bands of the caspase-3-cleaved MST2 remains unclear. From the relative intensity of the anti-MST2 and anti-phosphothreonine immunostain of the truncated MST2, it may be suggested that the enzyme was highly phosphorylated. Kinase activity determination of the immunoprecipitates indicated that the truncated MST2 was much more active than the full-length MST2 (Fig.6C). Thus, MST2 in apoptotic cells appears to exist mainly in a caspase-3-cleaved, phosphorylated and highly active form. Previous studies showed that MST2 was cleaved by caspase-3 and activated during cell apoptosis. Because both the full-length MST2 and caspase-3-truncated MST2 appear to depend on phosphorylation of Thr180 for kinase activity, we have investigated the possibility that the two forms of MST2 are differentially regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms. A caspase-3-truncated MST2 construct was transfected into 293T cells to overexpress the truncated MST2. In an attempt to generate the dephosphorylated TF-MST2, the cells were lysed in buffer without MCT. To our surprise, the TF-MST2, unlike the FL-MST2, was found not to require MCT for the preservation of the protein phosphorylation. The enzyme in lysates with and without MCT displayed essentially identical reactivity toward the anti-phosphothreonine antibody on the Western blot. Fig.7A shows that the phosphorylation state of the overexpressed TF-MST2 was not significantly changed even after 9 h of incubation in cell lysates. In contrast, greater than 907 loss of FL-MST2 phosphorylation occurred after 30 min of incubation (see Fig. 1B). The observation suggests that the phosphorylation of TF-MST2 is almost irreversible whereas the phosphorylation of FL-MST2 is readily reversed by protein phosphatases. As described in an early section, overexpressed FL-MST2 in 293T cells was partially phosphorylated because it could be further phosphorylated in the cell lysates with MCT upon ATP/Mg2+ supplements (see Fig. 3B). In contrast, overexpressed TF-MST2 in 293T cells appears to be fully phosphorylated. 293T cell lysates with MCT containing overexpressed TF-MST2 was supplemented with ATP/Mg2+ and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The sample, along with the control sample without the ATP/Mg2+supplements, was analyzed for protein phosphorylation by Western blot. The TF-MST2 that had been subjected to the phosphorylation condition displayed essentially identical reactivity toward the anti-phosphothreonine antibody as the control enzyme (data not shown). To further test the suggestion that the phospho-TF-MST2 cannot be readily dephosphorylated, both the overexpressed phospho-FL-MST2 and phospho-TF-MST2 were immunoprecipitated using the anti-Myc (9E10) antibody, and then tested for their dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates showed that the full-length MST2 could be readily dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1, whereas under the same condition, the truncated MST2 was not dephosphorylated significantly (Fig. 7B). A similar result was obtained if protein phosphatase 2A instead of protein phosphatase 1 was used (data not shown). To ensure that the differential response of FL-MST2 and TF-MST2 to protein phosphatases is also manifested in the kinase activity, the effect of dephosphorylation on the activities of phospho-FL-MST2 and phospho-TF-MST2 were determined and compared. 293T cells overexpressing FL- or TF-MST2 were lysed in the buffer with or without 0.1 ॖm MCT. The protein kinases were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody (9E10) and analyzed for kinase activities. The activity of FL-MST2 from lysates with 0.1 ॖm MCT was about double of lysates without MCT, whereas TF-MST2 samples obtained from the different lysis conditions displayed identical kinase activity (Fig. 7C). From these results, we suggest that FL-MST2 and TF-MST2 are differentially regulated by protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms. Both forms of MST2 depend on autophosphorylation for kinase activity but only the FL-MST2 activation can be reversed by protein phosphatases. As a result, TF-MST2 in cells is predominantly in the phosphorylated state, and therefore 舠constitutively active.舡 In this study, we used deletion and site-directed mutant constructs of MST2, in combination with in vitrocharacterization of the enzyme activation and enzyme phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, to explore the mechanism of MST2 regulation. Our results showed that the phosphorylation of MST2 at a threonine residue, Thr180, in the kinase activation loop was crucial for MST2 kinase activity. Substitution of Thr180 by an alanine residue completely abolished the activity of either the full-length or the truncated form of MST2 suggesting that both forms of MST2 depend on Thr180phosphorylation for kinase activity. The suggestion was further substantiated by the observation that dephosphorylation of MST2 caused a significant decrease in kinase activity. A number of studies have suggested that MST2 (or MST1) is activated by a protein phosphorylation mechanism (16Lee K.K. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12351-12358Google Scholar, 17Graves J.D. Draves K.E. Gotoh Y. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14909-14915Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence at Thr180 of MST2, KRXTXXGTP, is conserved in several MST kinase family members including α-PAK, γ-PAK, and MST1, and phosphorylation of this conserved threonine residue in these protein kinases have been shown to result in kinase activation (20Lian J.P. Toker A. Badwey J.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6349-6357Google Scholar, 21Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Google Scholar). Thus, our result is in agreement with these early findings. On the other hand, Lee and Yonehara (16Lee K.K. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12351-12358Google Scholar) suggested in a recent publication that the activation of MST in apoptotic cells does not depend on protein phosphorylation, because both the full-length MST and the caspase-3-truncated form of MST in staurosporine-induced apoptotic cells existed in an unphosphorylated state. However, kinase activity of MST in the staurosporine-treated cells was not determined. The mechanism of MST2 phosphorylation is complex, and Thr180 is likely not the sole phosphorylation site in the enzyme. For example, the MST2 mutant T180A overexpressed in 293T cells still showed immunoreactivity toward anti-phosphothreonine antibody, indicating the existence of the phosphorylation site threonine residue(s) in addition to Thr180. The observation that the truncated MST2 (T180A) mutant was completely devoid of immunoreactivity toward the anti-phosphothreonine antibody indicates that the additional threonine phosphorylation site(s) is localized in the caspase-3-cleaved carboxyl-terminal fragment. The regulatory significance of the additional threonine phosphorylation is not known but it is clearly not essential for the kinase activity. In addition, MST2 may contain phosphoserine residues, which would have eluded detection by the anti-phosphothreonine antibody used in this study. It should also be noted that MST1/2 appears to contain phosphorylation sites that are involved in kinase inhibition; Creasy and Chernoff (3Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Google Scholar) showed that MST1 from epidermal growth factor-treated COS cells could be activated by protein phosphatase 2A. Graves et al. (17Graves J.D. Draves K.E. Gotoh Y. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14909-14915Google Scholar) have identified Ser326 as a major phosphorylation site in MST1, the phosphorylation at this site regulates the caspase-3 cleavage of the enzyme. This serine residue is conserved in MST2 as Ser323, its phosphorylation, however, was not investigated in this study. Several lines of evidence suggest that the phosphorylation of Thr180 in MST2 is an autocatalytic reaction. The strongest evidence is that the kinase dead mutant MST2 (K56R), in contrast to wild type MST2 or active MST2 mutants, was poorly phosphorylated when overexpressed in 293T cells. The observation that the dephosphorylated and immunoprecipitated MST2 could be phosphorylated in the presence of ATP/Mg2+, with accompanying kinase activation, further supports such a suggestion. The time course of the MST2-catalyzed reaction showed upward curvature, also characteristic of an autoactivating reaction. One important feature of the MST2 autophosphorylation reaction is that the reaction showed a strong dependence on the enzyme concentration. The result indicates that the autophosphorylation reaction is an intermolecular rather than intramolecular reaction. It is well established that both MST1 and MST2 could form homodimers. The protein domain responsible for MST2 dimerization locates in the extreme COOH-terminal 57 amino acids (5Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Google Scholar). We observed that a dimerization-deficient mutant, MST2 (L448P), had essentially the same level of phosphorylation as wild type MST2 in 293T cells. 2Y. Deng, and J. H. Wang, unpublished results. The result suggests that the enzyme concentration dependence of the autophosphorylation reaction is not related to the dimerization of the enzyme, rather it may be attributed to the interaction between MST2 dimers. During the preparation of the manuscript, a paper (22Glantschnig H. Rodan G.A. Reszka A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42987-42996Google Scholar) on the regulation of MST1 by protein phosphorylation was published. Many of the findings on the regulatory phosphorylation of MST1 are the same as those we have reported in this study for MST2. They include the identification of the activation loop threonine, Thr183, as the essential phosphorylation site and demonstrated that this threonine phosphorylation is via an intermolecular autophosphorylation reaction. Interestingly, the approaches used in the two studies are significantly different. The strong protein concentration dependence of the autophosphorylation reaction appears to have important regulatory significance for MST2. In contrast to the transfected MST2, endogenous MST2 in cultured cells or in rat thymus had essentially no reactivity toward the anti-phosphothreonine antibody. This may be attributed to the low cellular MST2 concentration, which can support only very slow autophosphorylation reactions. Thus, one potential mechanism for MST2 activation is to facilitate the autophosphorylation reaction by increasing the enzyme concentration. Lee and Yonehara (16Lee K.K. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12351-12358Google Scholar) have observed the shuttling of MST between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, and Khokhlatchev et al. (23Kokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 253-265Google Scholar) have demonstrated the membrane recruitment of MST1 by the Ras effector protein NORE. These results suggest that MST1/2 may be induced to translocate to specific cellular compartments. It is conceivable that compartmentalization of MST1/2 in the cells could markedly increase the local enzyme concentration so as to facilitate the autophosphorylation/autoactivation reaction. In addition to raising local MST2 concentration, the autophosphorylation reaction in the cells may be enhanced by inhibiting protein phosphatases. It has been reported that MST phosphorylation in the activation loop could be induced by introducing the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, or calyculin A into cultured cells or neutrophils (16Lee K.K. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12351-12358Google Scholar, 20Lian J.P. Toker A. Badwey J.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6349-6357Google Scholar). However, physiological stimulus that can activate MST1/2 by inhibiting protein phosphatases has not been reported. In this respect, the observation that the autophosphorylated TF-MST2 is highly resistant to protein phosphatase reactions is significant. We have found, in this study, that the autophosphorylated TF-MST2, in contrast to the autophosphorylated FL-MST2, is highly resistant to dephosphorylation by both protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A. Our result differs from the finding of Graves et al.(17Graves J.D. Draves K.E. Gotoh Y. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14909-14915Google Scholar) that MST1 from apoptotic cells could be inactivated by protein phosphatase 2A. The discrepancy may be attributed to a difference in the regulatory properties of MST1 and MST2. The possibility that the discrepancy arises from the differences in experimental conditions and that factors in addition to the molecular properties of TF-MST2 contribute to the remarkable phosphatase resistance cannot be excluded. It is well documented that MST1 and MST2 are activated and cleaved by caspase-3 during cell apoptosis. Because both the full-length and the caspase-3-truncated forms of MST depend on the phosphorylation of Thr180 for kinase activity, the question arises as to how the caspase-3 action contributes to the activation of MST2 during apoptosis. Based on results of the present study, we have proposed a molecular model to address this question. As schematically shown in Fig. 8, the model suggests that at the prevailing cytoplasmic MST2 and protein phosphatase concentrations in growing cells, MST2 exists mainly in the unphosphorylated and inactive state. During cell apoptosis, caspase-3 is activated resulting in the conversion of MST2 to the truncated form. Both the full-length and the truncated MST2 can undergo autophosphorylation and autoactivation. The autophosphorylation of the full-length MST2 is readily reversed by protein phosphatases while that of the truncated form is remarkably resistant to protein phosphatases. Thus, through the caspase-3 action, MST2 is converted into a constitutively active kinase. Although, the proposed model of MST2 regulation is far from proven, it is supported by the finding that truncated MST2 in anisomycin-induced apoptotic HeLa cells is present in an active and highly phosphorylated form whereas the full-length MST2 is not phosphorylated and displays very low kinase activity. We are grateful to Dr. Zhenguo Wu for providing anisomycin and preparation of the manuscript."

Here we analyze properties of human FEN1 having mutations at two conserved glycines (G66S and G242D) causing defects in nuclease activity. Introduction of these mutants into yeast led to sequence expansions. Reconstituting triplet repeat expansion in vitro, we previously found that DNA ligase I promotes expansion, but FEN1 prevents the ligation that forms expanded products. Here we show that among the intermediates that could generate sequence expansion, a bubble is necessary for ligation to produce the expansion product. Severe exonuclease defects in the mutant FEN1 suggested that the inability to degrade bubbles exonucleolytically leads to expansion. However, even wild type FEN1 exonuclease cannot compete with DNA ligase I to degrade a bubble structure before it can be ligated. Instead, we propose that FEN1 suppresses sequence expansion by degrading flaps that equilibrate with bubbles, thereby reducing bubble concentration. In this way FEN1 employs endonuclease rather than exonuclease to prevent expansions. A model is presented describing the roles of DNA structure, DNA ligase I, and FEN1 in sequence expansion.

Repeats of simple sequences occur commonly in the human genome (1Debrauwere H. Gendrel C.G. Lechat S. Dutreix M. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,2Paulson H.L. Fischbeck K.H. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 79-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). They are highly polymorphic in populations, allowing them to be widely used as markers for gene mapping and medical purposes (3Sutherland G.R. Richards R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3636-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Within the last decade it has become more evident that these simple repeats can lead to a characteristic type of mutation that causes human diseases (3Sutherland G.R. Richards R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3636-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that the expansion of dinucleotide repeats is associated with human cancers including those of colon, esophagus, stomach, and lung (4Thibodeau S.N. Bren G. Schaid D.

The expansion of trinucleotide repeats (TNR) 1The abbreviations used are: TNRtrinucleotide repeatFEN1flap endonulease 1PCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigen5-FOA5-fluoro-orotic acidMMRmismatch repair is now known to be responsible for at least 15 hereditary neurological diseases in humans (8Mirkin S.M. Smirnova E.V. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 5-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, among all the possible triplet repeats, only three of them are capable of expanding: (CAG)n·(CTG)n, (CGG)n·(CCG)n, and (GAA)n·(TTC)n. The propensity of these sequences to form secondary structures such as hairpins, tetraplexes, and triplexes is thought to inhibit the activities of DNA replication and repair proteins and lead to sequence expansion (9Gacy A.M. Goellner G. Juranic N. Macura S. McMurray C.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 10Fry M. Loeb L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Some of them are based on DNA replication (12Jakupciak J.P. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40003-40013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Others are derived from the mechanisms of recombination, including gene conversion and DNA repair (13Kovtun I.V. McMurray C.T. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Most current information relates to the DNA replication-based models. In the DNA slippage model, the DNA polymerase is forced to pause by the secondary structures formed within the TNR sequence. The delay in replication allows nascent Okazaki fragments to transiently dissociate and reanneal in misaligned configurations, creating hairpin and bubble structures. Elongation and ligation of adjacent Okazaki fragments with such structures produce a sequence expansion (14Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2875-2878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The positive correlation among stabilities of secondary structures, inhibition of replication proteins, and propensity for TNR expansion supports the model (15Ohshima K. Kang S. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1853-1856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is also consistent with the finding that both CTG and CGG repeats are prone to expand when they are replicated as the lagging strand (16Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 17Hirst M.C. White P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The sequence expansion model proposed by Gordenin, Kunkel, and Resnick (19Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) is based on the fact that inefficient cleavage of a flap by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) mainly leads to DNA sequence duplication mutations (18Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In this model, DNA strand displacement synthesis creates a TNR flap. Internal complimentarity of the repeats in the flap allow it to form various secondary structures such as foldbacks and hairpins. These structures inhibit FEN1 cleavage so that the enzyme fails to resolve them. Subsequently the unresolved structures reanneal to the template in a misaligned configuration to form a bubble intermediate. The bubble is ligated with the upstream Okazaki fragment by DNA ligase, generating triplet repeat expansion (19Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Henricksen L.A. Tom S. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

FEN1 is a structure-specific endo/exonuclease involved in removing initiator RNA primers on Okazaki fragments (21Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

The name of FEN1 derives from its preference for substrates with a primer having an unannealed 5′-flap (21Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The mechanism of RNA primer removal involves creation of a flap by strand displacement synthesis. By the current understanding of this process, part of the flap is removed by an endonuclease named Dna2 protein. The remainder of the flap is removed by FEN1, leaving a nick that can be ligated (28Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The importance of FEN1 in DNA replication and repair has been implicated by studies in vivo. In S. cerevisiae, the FEN1 homologue is called RAD27/RTH1 (29Reagan M.S. Pittenger C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 364-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therad27/RTH1Δ mutant displayed phenotypes indicative of defects in DNA replication and repair (29Reagan M.S. Pittenger C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 364-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Vallen E.A. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4291-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). At a restrictive temperature (37 °C), the growth and cell division of therad27Δ mutant stop. Morphological examination of the mutant cells has shown that most of the cells arrest during division as two large partially divided cells, with a blocked nuclear division, indicating cell cycle arrest. This phenotype resembles that ofcdc2 mutants known to be defective in DNA replication. The mutant is highly sensitive to alkylating agents, such as methyl methanesulfonate, but moderately sensitive to x-ray and UV irradiation, suggesting that the enzyme is important in DNA base excision repair (29Reagan M.S. Pittenger C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 364-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sommers C.H. Miller E.J. Dujon B. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4193-4196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In mice, the absence of FEN1 function results in embryonic lethality, demonstrating that FEN1 is essential in mammals (32Kucherlapati M. Yang K. Kuraguchi M. Zhao J. Lia M. Heyer J. Kane M. Fan K. Russell R. Brown A. Kneitz B. Edelmann W. Kolodner R. Lipkin M. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9924-9929Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Knocking out one copy of each FEN1 and adenomatous polyposis coli genes in mice leads to progression of adenocarcinomas. These phenotypes arise because of the partial loss of FEN1 function in mammalian DNA replication and repair (32Kucherlapati M. Yang K. Kuraguchi M. Zhao J. Lia M. Heyer J. Kane M. Fan K. Russell R. Brown A. Kneitz B. Edelmann W. Kolodner R. Lipkin M. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9924-9929Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). FEN1 activity is also critical in maintaining genome stability. Genetic studies have shown that functional defects in the 5′ to 3′ exonuclease domain of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, a homologue of mammalian FEN1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD27, enhances dinucleotide repeat expansion and spontaneous mutation (33Morel P. Reverdy C. Michel B. Ehrlich S.D. Cassuto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10003-10008Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34Nagata Y. Mashimo K. Kawata M. Yamamoto K. Genetics. 2002; 160: 13-23PubMed Google Scholar). Most of these mutations are caused by sequence duplications. The rad27Δ mutant also allows frequent repeat sequence expansion. The CAG and CGG repeat sequences associated with human neurogenetic diseases are readily expanded in therad27Δ mutant strain (35Schweitzer J.K. Livingston D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 36White P.J. Borts R.H. Hirst M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5675-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As with its bacterial counterpart, the deletion of RAD27 increases spontaneous forward mutation frequency by about 50-fold (18Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Even partially defective rad27 mutant strains show enhanced forward mutation frequency (37Xie Y. Liu Y. Argueso J.L. Henricksen L.A. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4889-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of the forward mutations resulting from the duplications of small direct repeats are primarily due to the increase in repeat length (18Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 37Xie Y. Liu Y. Argueso J.L. Henricksen L.A. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4889-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that an unresolved flap resulting from a FEN1 functional defect reanneals to its template and forms a bubble intermediate that generates sequence expansion. In vitro studies have been performed to further examine the role of FEN1 in TNR expansion (20Henricksen L.A. Tom S. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16420-16427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These used various secondary structures that simulate the foldback and hairpin intermediates that are frequently found in TNR flaps (20Henricksen L.A. Tom S. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16420-16427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 38Spiro C. Pelletier R. Rolfsmeier M.L. Dixon M.J. Lahue R.S. Gupta G. Park M.S. Chen X. Mariappan S.V. McMurray C.T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1079-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The results demonstrated that both foldback and hairpin flap structures inhibit FEN1 activity. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a known stimulator of FEN1, and replication protein A both failed to assist FEN1 to resolve these structures (20Henricksen L.A. Tom S. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16420-16427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 39Wu X. Li J. Li X. Hsieh C.L. Burgers P.M. Lieber M.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recently, reconstituting expansion in vitro with purified replication and repair proteins and the substrates containing CTG repeats, we observed progressive inhibition of CTG repeat expansion by increasing amounts of FEN1 (41Henricksen L.A. Veeraraghavan J. Chafin D.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22361-22369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Overall these results suggest that secondary structures in TNR flaps resist the mechanism by which FEN1 suppresses expansions. However, in vivo, wild type FEN1 is highly effective at inhibiting expansion. In addition, FEN1 is involved in suppressing recombination. Therad27Δ mutant displays high recombination rates (18Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 30Vallen E.A. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4291-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,42Gary R. Park M.S. Nolan J.P. Cornelius H.L. Kozyreva O.G. Tran H.T. Lobachev K.S. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5373-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism is that the unresolved flaps inrad27 mutant strains accumulate and further misalign into loops and nicks. These flap and loop structures, if not removed by other repair proteins, are susceptible to double-strand breaks. The presence of such breaks is known to promote recombination (18Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In fact, RAD27 has been found to be essential for viability of yeast strains having a defective double-strand break repair function (18Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fragmented DNA was identified in rad27mutant strains (30Vallen E.A. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4291-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The observations indicate that production of double-strand DNA breaks is likely a mechanism that leads to increased DNA recombination in rad27 mutants, presumably because of the failure of resolving flap structures in these strains. Another consideration is that the persistence of flap and loop structures expected in rad27 mutants provides single-stranded regions that could serve as strand invasion sites for recombination. Therefore, one can readily envision how prompt resolution of the FEN1 flap substrate would prevent accumulation of recombinogenic lesions. A recent study has found that expression of human FEN1 in yeast restricts recombination between short sequences, implying that the nuclease participates the removal of 5′ overhangs that mediate short sequence recombination (43Negritto M.C. Qiu J. Ratay D.O. Shen B. Bailis A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2349-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). FEN1 is a highly conserved enzyme. Its homologues have been identified from bacteriophage, bacteria, archea, yeast, and mammals including mouse and human (44Shen B. Qiu J. Hosfield D. Tainer J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 171-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Rad27p, the FEN1 homologue from S. cerevisiae, is highly homologous with human FEN1. Among the amino acids of the two FEN1 homologues, 79% are conserved, and 61% are identical (44Shen B. Qiu J. Hosfield D. Tainer J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 171-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, human FEN1 can complement most of the phenotypes resulting from the rad27Δ mutation in yeast demonstrating functional conservation (45Greene A.L. Snipe J.R. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This makes therad27Δ strain a good model system to test the biological properties of human FEN1 mutants in vivo (45Greene A.L. Snipe J.R. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Previously, we characterized two RAD27 mutant alleles,rad27-G67S and rad27-G240D isolated by genetic screening (37Xie Y. Liu Y. Argueso J.L. Henricksen L.A. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4889-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These mutations are located on two highly conserved glycines (Gly67 and Gly240) within seven different species including bacteriophage, bacteria, yeast, mouse, and human (44Shen B. Qiu J. Hosfield D. Tainer J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 171-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both mutant strains exhibit a high frequency of dinucleotide repeat expansion and spontaneous mutation. In vitro biochemical characterization has shown that both mutant proteins have reduced endonucleolytic activity, have a severe exonucleolytic defect, and failed to degrade bubbles (37Xie Y. Liu Y. Argueso J.L. Henricksen L.A. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4889-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These results lead us to propose that loss of exonuclease function of FEN1 allows sequence expansions. Here we explore whether human FEN1 employs exonuclease to suppress sequence expansion to further understand the roles of this enzyme in suppressing TNR expansion directly associated with human diseases. We took advantage of high homology and functional conservation between Rad27 and FEN1 proteins to make point mutations in the analogous glycines (Gly66 and Gly242) of human FEN1. We show that the mutations cause defects that lead to sequence expansion when the human enzyme is assayed in yeast. However, our study suggests that FEN1 utilizes its endonuclease rather than exonuclease activity to suppress the sequence expansion, leading us to revise our previous hypothesis. Our results also have provided refinements to the expansion model proposed by Gordenin, Kunkel, and Resnick (19Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Based on this model, we suggest the pathways for generating triplet repeat expansion when FEN1 activity is compromised during DNA replication and roles of DNA structure, FEN1, and DNA ligase I in the process. Yeast rad27Δ strains, EAY614 (MATa leuΔ ura3-25 lys2BglII trp1Δ 63 his3Δ rad27::HIS3) and EAY615 (MATα leuΔ ura3-25 lys2BglII trp1Δ63 his3Δ rad27::HIS3) were obtained from Dr. Eric Alani at Cornell University and were grown in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium. The plasmid pRS315 (yeast centromere plasmid containing LEU2 selectable marker) and pSH44 ((GT)16G-URA3-ARSH4 CEN6 TRP1) were generous gifts from Dr. Fred Sherman at University of Rochester and Dr. Eric Alani, respectively. The strains bearing either RAD27or human FEN1 were grown in minimal selective medium (46Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 171-174Google Scholar). 5-Fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) was from Zymo Research (Orange, CA) and U.S. Biologicals (Swampscott, MA), respectively, and used as previously described (37Xie Y. Liu Y. Argueso J.L. Henricksen L.A. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4889-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Radionucleotides [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 or 6000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. T4 polynucleotide kinase and Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (labeling grade) were from Roche Diagnostics. All of the other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were analytical grade. A protein expression plasmid, FCH-pET28b, containing wild type human FEN1 open reading frame (47Bornarth C.J. Ranalli T.A. Henricksen L.A. Wahl A.F. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13347-13354Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was utilized as a template for creating two point mutations, G66S and G242D in the protein coding region. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit. Oligonucleotides 5′-CCAGCCACCTGATGAGCATGTTCTACCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGGTAGAACATGCTCATCAGGTGGCTGG-3′ were used to generate the G66S mutation, and 5′-GTATCCGGGGTATTGACCCCAAGCGGGCTGTG-3′ and 5′-CACAGCCCGCTTGGGGTCAATACCCCGGATAC-3′ were used to generate the G242D mutation. The substituted codons are denoted in bold type for both primer sets, and the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. To construct a plasmid that can constitutively express wild type and mutant human FEN1 in yeast, a standard PCR method was performed to generate fragments ofADH1 promoter and terminator using pGADT7 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) plasmid as a source of template sequences. Subsequently, ADH1 promoter was inserted into SacI and XbaI sites of pRS315, andADH1 terminator was inserted into XhoI andApaI sites of the plasmid. The encoding regions of wild type and mutant human FEN1 were amplified by PCR from plasmids FEN1-pET28b,fen1-G66S-pET28b, and fen1-G242D-pET28b as described above using the oligonucleotides 5′-GTCTAGAAAGCATATGGGAATTCAAGGCCTGGCC-3′ and 5′-ACGCTCGAGTTATTTTCCCCTTTTAAACTTCCCTGC-3′. TheRAD27 encoding region was amplified from plasmidRAD27-pET24b (37Xie Y. Liu Y. Argueso J.L. Henricksen L.A. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4889-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) by PCR using the oligonucleotides 5′-TCTAGAAAGATGGGTATTAAAGGTTTGAATGC-3′, 5′-ACGCTCGAGTCATCTTCTTCCCTTTGTGACTTTATTC-3′. These PCR primers created XbaI and XhoI sites as underlined in the primers in the PCR products that subsequently were inserted in between ADH1 promoter and terminator to generate plasmids pYYL1 (RAD27-pRS315-ADH1promoter-terminator), pYYL4 (FEN1-pRS315-ADH1promoter-terminator), pYYL5 (fen1-G66S-pRS315-ADH1 promoter-terminator), and pYYL6 (fen1-G242D-pRS315-ADH1promoter-terminator). These plasmids possessing a centromere and aLEU2 selectable marker put either wild type or mutant FEN1 under the control of the ADH1 promoter and terminator. The plasmids were subsequently introduced into yeast EAY614 strain for expression of mutant forms of FEN1 to measure their effects on repeat tract instability. This created strains YL1 (RAD27), YL4 (FEN1), YL5 (fen1-G66S), and YL6 (fen1-G242D). The strains were subsequently transformed by an indicator plasmid, pSH44, for measuring dinucleotide repeat expansion. In pSH44, an in-frame poly(GT)16G tract is inserted upstream of the URA3 gene (48Henderson S.T. Petes T.D. Genetics. 1993; 134: 57-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in a Ura+ phenotype. The poly(GT)16 repeat expansions resulting from FEN1 functional defects can create the frameshifts that disrupt the URA3 gene product leading to 5-FOA resistance in the strains having pSH44. The sequence expansion rate (see Table II) was calculated from frequency of 5-FOA-resistant colonies by utilizing the method of the median (49Lea D.E. Coulson C.A. J. Genet. 1949; 49: 264-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). The frequency data were obtained by counting the number of surviving cells of a million (106) either wild type or mutant cells plated on the minimal selective medium containing 5-FOA. The experimental procedure was the same as described before (37Xie Y. Liu Y. Argueso J.L. Henricksen L.A. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4889-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previously, we found that all of the frameshifts in poly(GT)16G tract of pSH44 created byrad27Δ, rad27-G67S, and rad27-G240Dmutations are sequence expansions (37Xie Y. Liu Y. Argueso J.L. Henricksen L.A. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4889-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, the frameshift events of poly(GT)16G occurring in FEN1 mutant strains represent the sequence expansions created by FEN1 mutations. The genetic data shown in Table II were statistically analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test, where p values of <0.05 are considered significant (50Pfaffenberger R.C. Peterson J.H. Statitical Methods for Business and Economics. Richard D.

The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer, and bacterial cells were lysed by three passes through a French press. The cell lysate was subsequently sedimented for 30 min at 30,000 ×g.

https://openalex.org/W2086489022,"Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) is frequently overexpressed in a variety of cancer types. Since many breast tumors and cancer cell lines overexpress IGF-IR, we tested IGF-I effects on chemotherapy-treated breast cancer cells. IGF-I protects from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, suggesting that overlapping signaling pathways modulate IGF-I and chemotherapy treatment outcomes. Taxol and other chemotherapy drugs induce c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a kinase that conveys cellular stress and death signals. Notably, in this paper we show that IGF-I alone induces a potent JNK response and this activity is reversed by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) with LY294002 in MCF-7 but not T47D cells. Cotreatment of cells with chemotherapy and IGF-I leads to additive JNK responses. Using cells overexpressing Akt, we confirm that IGF-I-mediated survival is Akt dependent. In contrast, overexpression of JNK significantly enhances Taxol-induced apoptosis and inhibits IGF-I survival effects. Further, JNK attenuates anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7 cells. The inhibitory effect of JNK appears to be mediated by serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate) since both Taxol and IGF-I treatment enhanced Ser(312) IRS-1 phosphorylation, while LY294002 blocked IGF-I-mediated phosphorylation. Taken together, these data provide a mechanism whereby stress or growth factors activate JNK to reduce proliferation and/or survival in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1966326970,"Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a pluripotent cytokine that controls peripheral T cell tolerance mainly in mucosal immunity. It is secreted by regulatory T cells (Tr /Th3) but also by other immununologically active cells. Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) and hepatic growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hgs) are involved in TGF-beta1 signaling. Both molecules are known to present Smad2 and Smad3 to the TGF-beta receptor complex. The role of SARA and Hgs in TGF-beta1 susceptibility of human CD4+ T cells is unclear. We demonstrate here that TGF-beta1 up-regulates SARA mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells similar to that of Smad7. However, the increase in SARA expression was lower (6.1+/-0.3-fold vs. 25+/-4.1-fold) compared with Smad7 and delayed, with a maximum at 12 h compared with 2 h. Th1 and Th2 cell subsets expressed the same levels of SARA and Hgs. Compared with resting cells, significantly lower levels of the two molecules were found in antigen/allergen- or anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated cells. Down-regulation of SARA and Hgs mRNA in preactivated CD4+ T cells was accompanied by a twofold increase in a TGF-beta1 responsive reporter gene assay. Overexpression of SARA and Hgs in T cells yielded a dose-dependent decrease in cotransfected reporter gene expression, indicating an inhibitory function of both molecules. Thus, SARA and Hgs are regulators of TGF-beta1 susceptibility in T cells and integrate regulatory signals into the influence of TGF-beta1-mediated suppression of human T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1967790134,"Activation of the tumor suppressor p53 after genotoxic insults may result in two different responses: growth arrest or apoptosis. In this study, we analysed how mitogenic stimulation of primary mouse lymphocytes influences p53 signaling upon gamma-irradiation. We found that G(0) lymphocytes rapidly went into p53-dependent apoptosis, whereas stimulated lymphocytes went into a p53-dependent, p21-mediated growth arrest. The switch in p53 response upon stimulation did neither result from a switch in transcriptional activation of major p53 target genes, nor from the high level of p21 expressed in stimulated, irradiated cells. Growth stimulation, however, led to the upregulation of the antiapoptotic factors Bcl-x(L) and Bfl-1. In resting cells, p53 induced apoptosis after gamma-irradiation was accompanied by a breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential (psi(m)) that was counteracted by growth stimulation. We propose that growth stimulation intercepted p53 proapoptotic signaling at the level of mitochondrial integrity, most likely by upregulating the antiapoptotic factors Bcl-x(L) and Bfl-1. Upregulation of Bcl-x(L) and of Bfl-1 upon growth stimulation was mediated by the PKC-dependent activation of NF-kappaB. Consequently, blocking PKC activity restored apoptosis in stimulated, irradiated splenocytes. The inherent coupling of growth stimulation with antiapoptotic signaling in primary lymphocytes might provide hints as to how precancerous lymphocytes bypass the need for mutational inactivation of p53. Thus, our findings might explain the relatively low frequency of p53 mutations in lymphomas in comparison to other tumor entities."

https://openalex.org/W2067852656,"Eukaryotic translation can be initiated either by a cap-dependent mechanism or by internal ribosome entry, a process by which ribosomes are directly recruited to structured regions of mRNA upstream of the initiation codon. Here we report the finding of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the untranslated region of the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) gene. EBNA1 is the only nuclear protein expressed in all known states of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency and in the virus lytic cycle, and is required for the maintenance of the EBV episome. Using cDNA reporter constructs and in vitro transfection assays, we found that sequences contained in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the Fp and Qp initiated EBNA1 mRNA increased the expression level 4-14- fold in different Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. The U leader exon, located within the 5' UTR, included in all known EBNA1 transcripts and also contained in the EBNA3, 4 and 6 mRNAs, was demonstrated by bicistronic expression analyses to contain an IRES. The EBNA IRES initiates translation more efficiently than the encephalomyocarditis virus IRES in EBV-positive lymphoma cells. We propose that the EBNA IRES constitute a novel mechanism, whereby EBV regulates latent gene expression."

In this study, the basal and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-induced activation of NF-kappaB has been examined in cells overexpressing H-Ras, K-Ras or N-Ras. Cells expressing H-Ras exhibited a basal kappaB activity that correlated with sustained IkappaB kinase activation and lower steady-state levels of IkappaBalpha in the cytosol. Upon activation with TNFalpha, the cells expressing the distinct Ras isoforms behaved similarly in terms of binding of nuclear proteins to a kappaB sequence and induction of a kappaB-dependent reporter gene. The basal activation of NF-kappaB in cells expressing H-Ras impaired staurosporine-induced apoptosis in these cells, through a mechanism that was NF-kappaB-dependent and inhibitable in the presence of z-VAD. Moreover, titration of caspase activation in response to staurosporine showed a significant resistance in cells expressing H-Ras when compared with the void vector or the N-Ras counterparts. These results indicate that the distinct Ras proteins have specific effects on the NF-kappaB pathway and that this action contributes to protect cells against apoptosis."

In a subset of patients, a specific t(21;22) chromosomal translocation involving the Ewing's sarcoma gene (EWS) and the ETS-related gene (ERG) generates instead an EWS/ERG fusion protein (2Sorensen P.H.B. Lessnick S.L. Lopez-Terrada D. Liu X.F. Triche T.J. Denny C.T. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 146-151Google Scholar). Due to the sequence homology between ERG and Fli-1, it is believed that EWS/ERG and EWS/Fli-1 function similarly in causing malignant transformation (3Im Y.-H. Kim H.T. Lee C. Poulin D. Welford S.

CADO-ES1 is an established human Ewing's sarcoma cell line that can differentiate into neural and mesenchymal cell lineages (9Kodama K. Doi O. Higashiyama M. Mori Y. Horai T. Tateishi R. Aoki Y.

Using mouse and human promoter constructs, we demonstrate that EWS/ERG sarcoma fusion protein, but not wild-type ERG, transactivatesCOL11A2. We also show that the ETS DNA-binding domain of the EWS/ERG fusion protein is necessary for transactivation ofCOL11A2 and present what we believe is the first evidence that transactivation by wild-type ERG is repressed by histone deacetylases. Unlike wild-type ERG, the EWS/ERG sarcoma fusion protein appears to activate genes through direct interaction with RNA Pol II and through avoiding repression by histone deacetylases.

Mutated nucleotides are indicated withuppercase letters. b, mutant reporter constructs were transfected into CADO-ES1 cells, and luciferase activity was normalized to the Renilla luciferase control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The cDNAs for ERG and EWS/ERG were cloned into the pSG5-FL expression vector (18Yang L. Embree L.J. Hickstein D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3345-3354Google Scholar). The resultant proteins are FLAG epitope-tagged at the N termini. EWS/ERG Δ ETS DNA-binding (EDB) domain was created by digestion with restriction enzymes BamHI/NcoI and subsequent self-ligation, resulting in the deletion of 39 residues from amino acids 343–381 of ERG within the EDB domain. Point mutations were introduced into the EDB domain of EWS/ERG using the Gene EditorTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Promega). For promoter analysis, two duplicate wells of 70% confluent CADO-ES1 or NIH3T3 cells (American Type Culture Collection) in six-well plates were transfected with 3.5 μg of pGL3 reporter plasmid, 1 μg of pSG5-FL effector plasmid, and 0.5 μg of pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase control using 30 μl of DOTAP transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were assayed for luciferase activity using Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) on a TD-20e luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). For inhibition of histone deacetylase, transfected cells were treated with 100 ng/ml trichostatin A (TSA) (Sigma) 18 h before luciferase assay and compared with transfected cells without TSA treatment. Transfection was repeated at least three times, and the luciferase activity was normalized to internal control. The results are shown as average ± S.E. CADO-ES1 nuclear extract was prepared as described previously (19Yang L. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32732-32739Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide containing wild-type human COL11A2 promoter sequence between −149 and −110 bp was used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. An otherwise identical probe mutatingtccctcc to tAActAA (Mut) was also used in the assay. 32P-Labeled DNA probe was incubated with CADO-ES1 nuclear extract (1 μg of protein) for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of poly(dI-dC) (50 μg/ml). The DNA-protein complexes were analyzed on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. For competition assay, unlabeled wild type or Mut was added to the reaction 10 min before the addition of the 32P-labeled wild type. Supershift experiments were done by the addition of C-20X rabbit polyclonal anti-ERG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) to the reaction mixture 1 h after the formation of the DNA-protein complexes. The reaction was continued for 3 h at 4 °C. Equal amount of normal rabbit IgG was added to a control sample to exclude nonspecific interactions. To cross-link DNA and protein, 1 × 108 of HeLa (American Type Culture Collection) or CADO-ES1 cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Chromatin solution was then prepared as described previously (20Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 10 μl of antibody against acetylated histone H3 (anti-Ac-H3; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or antibody against the N-terminal domain of EWS (N-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with chromatin solutions overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The immunocomplexes were collected with salmon sperm DNA/Protein A-Sepharose beads and washed sequentially with 200 μl of each of the following buffers containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma): once with wash buffer I (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl), once with wash buffer II (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl), once with wash buffer III (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 m LiCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate), and twice with PBS. Formaldehyde cross-linking was reversed by overnight incubation at 65 °C in 0.2 m NaCl plus 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma). The mixture was then extracted with phenol/chloroform, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 20 μl of H2O. 20 ng of the DNA template was then used for PCR amplification of GAPDH and COL11A2 promoter regions. Primers for GAPDH were 5′-tcctcctgtttcatccaagc-3′ (−358 to −377 bp from the transcriptional start site) and 5′-tagtagccgggccctacttt-3′ (−141 to −160 bp from the transcriptional start site). Primers for COL11A2 were 5′-caggagagagcgagcgatag-3′ (−167 to −147 bp from the transcriptional start site) and 5′-cccggcccggcccccgcctccagccgcccgcccacagcca-3′ (−89 to −50 bp from the transcriptional start site). The resulting products, 218 bp for GAPDH and 118 bp forCOL11A2, were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. CADO-ES1 cells or transfected NIH3T3 cells in a 10-cm dish were lysed with 1.2 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mmDTT) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The 8WG16 mouse monoclonal anti-RNA Pol II antibody (Research Diagnostics, Inc., Flanders, NJ) or a control mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with 40 μl of Protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 0.2 ml of buffer A for 50 min at 4 °C. The complex was then incubated with 0.2 ml of fresh cell lysate for 60 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. After four washes with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) at 4 °C, 40 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer was added to the agarose beads. The protein samples were denatured for 5 min at 95 °C, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and subjected to Western blotting with the C-20 rabbit polyclonal anti-ERG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by the anti-Pol II antibody. Protein bands were visualized with the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). Our previous RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression and splicing patterns of COL11A2 are linked to a chondrocytic phenotype in osteochondrogenic tumors (15Matsui Y. Kimura T. Tsumaki N. Nakata K. Yasui N. Araki N. Hashimoto N. Uchida A. Ochi T. Cancer Lett. 1998; 124: 143-148Google Scholar). The Ewing's sarcoma cell line CADO-ES1 also expressed COL11A2transcripts, but the splicing pattern of COL11A2 transcripts in Ewing's sarcoma cells differed from that in chondrocytes (Fig.1 a, lanes 1 and 2). Specifically, most COL11A2transcripts in CADO-ES1 cells retained combinations of alternative exons 6–8, whereas those in chondrocytes did not. Further analysis by RT-PCR and DNA sequencing showed that CADO-ES1 cells also express EWS/ERG fusion transcript of type I (Fig. 1, a,third panel from top, andb). Although there are no reported effects of EWS/ERG fusion protein on collagen gene expression, a function for wild-type ERG protein in chondrogenesis is well documented (14Iwamoto M. Higuchi Y. Koyama E. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Kurisu K. Yeh H. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Pacifici M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 27-39Google Scholar, 21Reymond A. Marigo V. Yaylaoglu M.B. Leoni A. Ucla C. Scamuffa N. Caccioppoli C. Dermitzakis E.T. Lyle R. Banfi S. Eichele G. Antonarakis S.E. Ballabio A. Nature. 2002; 420: 582-586Google Scholar). Chondrogenesis can be monitored by the induction of chondrocyte-specific collagen genes (e.g. type II, IX, and XI collagens) (13de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Behringer R.R. Bi W. Murakami S. Huang W. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 389-394Google Scholar). We hypothesized that ERG and/or EWS/ERG are directly involved in the expression of collagen genes and, in particular, the COL11A2 gene in CADO-ES1 Ewing's sarcoma cells. It has been reported that the mouseCol11a2 promoter sequence, −742 to +380 bp from the transcriptional start site, is sufficient to drive reporter gene expression (11Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Google Scholar), and multiple subregions between −742 and −453 bp are known to be involved in cartilage- and neural tissue-specific promoter activities (12Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Tanaka K. Kimura J.H. Ochi T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22861-22864Google Scholar). The mouse Col11a2 gene is located next to the retinoic acid receptor β (Rxrb) gene in a head-to-tail arrangement (Fig. 1 c, top line) (11Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Google Scholar). Human COL11A2 and RXRB are arranged similarly. The intergenic DNA sequences of mice and humans are highly homologous (Fig. 1 c, bottom line) (22Vuoristo M.M. Pihlajamaa T. Vandenberg P. Prockop D.J. Ala-Kokko L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22873-22881Google Scholar). The transcriptional start site in mouse corresponds to −327 bp from the human transcriptional start site (Fig. 1 c) (11Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Google Scholar, 23Lui V.C.H. Ng L.J. Sat E.W.Y. Cheah K.S.E. Genomics. 1996; 32: 401-412Google Scholar). In order to identify the promoter sequence responsible forCOL11A2 expression in CADO-ES1 cells, a range of pGL3 luciferase reporter plasmids containing various lengths of mouseCol11a2 promoter sequence were generated (Fig.1 c). The mouse Col11a2 promoter sequence from −742 to +380 bp was activated when transfected into CADO-ES1 cells (Fig. 1, c and d, construct −742). Interestingly, in CADO-ES1 cells, the mouse promoter constructs −530 and −500 containing either the cartilage- or the neural tissue-specific cis-elements (Fig. 1 c, top line) showed similar activity to the −453 construct containing only the constitutive promoter sequence between −453 and +380 bp (Fig. 1, c and d) (12Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Tanaka K. Kimura J.H. Ochi T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22861-22864Google Scholar). Further deletion analysis identified a necessary minimum sequence between +133 and +380 bp of the mouse promoter, which corresponds to −178 to +37 bp of the human COL11A2 promoter (Fig. 1, c andd, compare construct +133 and construct +264). The evolutionally conserved human COL11A2 promoter sequence between −149 and +27 bp was therefore cloned into the luciferase reporter vector and was equivalent in activity to the intact mouseCol11a2 promoter when transfected into CADO-ES1 cells (Fig.1, c and d, construct H149). Inspection of the DNA sequence between −149 and +27 bp of the human COL11A2 promoter revealedtccctcc, a tandem repeat of thetcc trinucleotides (TRT) (24Szymczyna B.R. Arrowsmith C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28363-28370Google Scholar), as well as at least twogggcgg Sp1 binding sites (Fig.2 a, construct H149). To test them for functional activity, a series of deletion and mutation constructs were generated for transfection (Fig. 2 a). Deletion between −149 and −85 bp, containing the TRT sequence decreased promoter activity by 50% (Fig. 2, construct H84). Mutation in the TRT sequence, from tccctcc to tAActAA (uppercase letters indicate mutated nucleotides), also decreased promoter activity (Fig. 2, construct mTRT), suggesting that the TRT sequence is involved in the expression of COL11A2 in CADO-ES1 cells. Deletion between −149 and −69 bp, containing the TRT sequence and the upstream Sp1 site (Sp1-u) decreased promoter activity by 70% (Fig. 2, construct H68). Deletion of the TRT sequence and the downstream Sp1 site (Sp1-d) also decreased promoter activity by 70% (Fig. 2, construct dH84). Deleting the DNA sequence between −149 and −41 bp nearly abolished the promoter activity (Fig. 2, construct H40), thus confirming the importance of the TRT sequence and Sp1 sites. Involvement of both Sp1 sites was further supported by mutations from gggcgggcgg to TTTcTTTcTT for the upstream Sp1 site and from gggcgg to TTTcTT for the downstream Sp1 site. Whereas mutating just one of the two Sp1 sites resulted in a 50% decrease (Fig. 2, constructs mSp1-u and mSp1-d), mutations at both Sp1 sites led to a 75% decrease in promoter activity (Fig. 2, construct mSp1-u/d). Together, these results indicate that in CADO-ES1 cells, the TRT site, and the Sp1 sites coordinately regulate COL11A2 promoter activity. Collagen gene regulation by Sp1 has been documented extensively (25Czuwara-Ladykowska J. Shirasaki F. Jackers P. Watson D.K. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20839-20848Google Scholar), whereas protein interactions with the TRT sequence have not been thoroughly investigated. To detect potential interactions between CADO-ES1 nuclear proteins and the TRT sequences within humanCOL11A2 promoter, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using a 40-bp DNA oligonucleotide matching −149 to −110 bp from the COL11A2 transcriptional start site (Fig.2 a). CADO-ES1 nuclear extract and the TRT sequence formed DNA-protein complexes designated as C1 and C2 (Fig.3 a, compare lanes 1 and 2). The addition of wild-type TRT competitor prevented formation of the C1 and C2 complexes (Fig.3 a, lane 3), but an excess of the mutated TRT DNA had little effect on the complex formation (Fig.3 a, lane 4). Furthermore, both C1 and C2 complex formation was eliminated by a specific anti-ERG antibody that recognizes the C-terminal portion of EWS/ERG fusion protein but not by a control IgG (Fig. 3 b, lanes 7and 8). Thus, EWS/ERG and/or ERG in CADO-ES1 nuclear extract appear to specifically interact with the TRT sequence within the humanCOL11A2 promoter. We next performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to determine whether EWS/ERG fusion protein selectively binds to COL11A2promoter in CADO-ES1 cells. Acetylated histone molecules are known to be enriched in areas near actively transcribed genes such asGAPDH (20Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Google Scholar). HeLa cells do not express COL11A2; therefore, the COL11A2 promoter region was not co-precipitated with an anti-Ac-H3 antibody in the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 3 c, compare lanes 9 and 10). In CADO-ES1 cells, theCOL11A2 gene is active, and its promoter sequence becomes cross-linked to acetylated histone H3 after treatment with formaldehyde (Fig. 3 c, compare lanes 11 and12). Interestingly, COL11A2 promoter sequence was enriched in immunocomplexes using an antibody that recognizes the N-terminal domain of EWS/ERG, and this enrichment appeared to be specific as GAPDH DNA was absent from the same immunocomplexes (Fig. 3 c, lane 13). These results suggest that EWS/ERG fusion protein interacts withCOL11A2 promoter in vivo. To investigate whether ERG and EWS/ERG can transactivate the COL11A2 promoter, ERG and EWS/ERG expression constructs were generated for co-transfection with theCOL11A2 promoter reporter construct. Our initial experiments showed minimal effects of ERG or EWS/ERG on COL11A2 promoter activity when transfected into CADO-ES1 cells (data not shown). We suspected that this might be caused by abundant endogenous EWS/ERG in CADO-ES1 cells; therefore, the experiments were repeated with NIH3T3 cells that do not express EWS/ERG orCol11a2 (26Liu Y. Li H. Tanaka K. Tsumaki N. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12712-12718Google Scholar). Whereas wild-type ERG protein had no effect onCOL11A2 promoter activity, the EWS/ERG sarcoma fusion protein potently transactivated human COL11A2 promoter construct H149 (Fig. 4). To investigate whether the transactivation was dependent on the ability of EWS/ERG to bind DNA, we constructed EWS/ERG mutants that lacked the EDB domain or had either of two EWS/ERG point mutants (W351R or R367L) within the EDB domain (Fig. 4 a). The W351R mutation of EWS/ERG is equivalent to the W321R mutation of Fli-1, an ETS protein with high sequence homology to ERG. Both point mutations are known to eliminate the DNA binding activity of Fli-1 and ERG (27Bailly R.-A. Bosselut R. Zucman J. Cormier F. Delattre O. Roussel M. Thomas G. Ghysdael J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3230-3241Google Scholar, 28Verger A. Buisine E. Carrere S. Wintjens R. Flourens A. Coll J. Stehelin D. Duterque-Coquillaud M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17181-17189Google Scholar). When co-transfected into NIH3T3 cells with the COL11A2 promoter construct H149, neither the EWS/ERG Δ EDB nor the two point mutations were able to transactivate the promoter (Fig. 4 b), suggesting that a functional EDB domain within EWS/ERG is critical for activation of theCOL11A2 promoter. Although both ERG and EWS/ERG have identical DNA binding domains, our findings show that only EWS/ERG is able to transactivate the COL11A2 promoter construct. It is important to understand the mechanism underlying this intriguing finding, since EWS is known to fuse with the DNA-binding domains of a variety of transcription factors in different sarcomas. Part of the explanation for the differential action may lie in the properties of the EWS component of the EWS/ERG fusion protein. Both wild-type EWS and EWS/Fli-1 sarcoma fusion protein have been reported to associate with RNA Pol II (5Yang L. Chansky H.A. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37612-37618Google Scholar). If the N-terminal region of EWS is indeed responsible for binding to RNA Pol II, then EWS/ERG should likewise interact with RNA Pol II. To test for this, CADO-ES1 cell lysate was treated with an anti-RNA Pol II antibody. Endogenous EWS/ERG but not ERG was co-precipitated with the RNA-Pol II, whereas a control mouse IgG did not immunoprecipitate either protein (Fig.5 a). With lysate from transfected NIH3T3 cells, the same anti-RNA Pol II antibody pulled down the FLAG-tagged EWS/ERG but not ERG (Fig. 5 b). Together, these results show that EWS/ERG, but not ERG, binds to RNA Pol II. Another property contributing to this dichotomous behavior could be a loss of function from the absence of the N-terminal ERG domain in the EWS/ERG sarcoma fusion protein. Our recent cloning and analysis of an ERG-associated protein with a SET domain (ESET) revealed that ESET protein acts as a histone H3-specific methyltransferase (29Yang L. Xia L. Wu D.Y. Wang H. Chansky H.A. Schubach W.H. Hickstein D.D. Zhang Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 148-152Google Scholar). Histone methyltransferases usually function in complexes with histone deacetylases to silence gene expression (30Czermin B. Schotta G. Hulsmann B.B. Brehm A. Becker P.B. Reuter G. Imhof A. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 915-919Google Scholar, 31Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 286-298Google Scholar, 32Vaute O. Nicolas E. Vandel L. Trouche D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 475-481Google Scholar), and ESET has been shown to recruit histone deacetylases as well as mSin3 transcriptional corepressors (33Yang L. Mei Q. Zielinska-Kwiatkowska A. Matsui Y. Blackburn M.L. Benedetti D. Krumm A. Taborsky Jr., G.J. Chansky H.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 651-657Google Scholar). Since EWS/ERG lacks the N-terminal domain of ERG responsible for binding to ESET, we suspected that ESET-associated histone deacetylases could suppress ERG-mediated transactivation, whereas these same histone deacetylases would have no such effect on EWS/ERG. Our approach in testing this hypothesis is based upon prior studies of histone deacetylases using reporter constructs (34Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.-M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.-M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Google Scholar, 35Nagy L. Kao H.-Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Google Scholar, 36Huang L. Sowa Y. Sakai T. Pardee A.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5712-5719Google Scholar). Transiently transfected plasmid DNA does not usually assume a native chromatin structure, but published observations indicate that histone molecules do associate with plasmid DNA to form nucleosome-like particles (37Morse R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 133-137Google Scholar,38Jeong S.W. Stein A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 370-375Google Scholar). A shift toward increased acetylation of these nucleosome-like particles can result in a more open structure that is accessible to the transcriptional machinery. In fact, inhibitors of histone deacetylases have been reported to similarly up-regulate promoter constructs in both transiently and stably transfected cells (39Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Google Scholar, 40Park S.H. Lee S.R. Kim B.C. Cho E.A. Patel S.P. Kang H.-B. Sausville E.A. Nakanishi O. Trepel J.B. Lee B.I. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5168-5174Google Scholar). We co-transfected NIH3T3 cells in duplicate plates with theCOL11A2 promoter construct H149 plus either ERG or EWS/ERG expression plasmid and then treated cells in one plate with TSA, a well known inhibitor of histone deacetylases (41Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Rifkind R.A. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2001; 13: 477-483Google Scholar). Transfected cells in the other plate were not treated with TSA; therefore, they were used as a control to calculate -fold derepression by TSA. Whereas the ability of wild-type ERG protein to transactivate theCOL11A2 promoter was significantly increased in the presence of TSA, transactivation by EWS/ERG fusion protein was not as profoundly influenced by TSA-mediated inhibition of histone deacetylases (Fig.6). The differential effects of EWS/ERG and ERG on COL11A2 promoter thus appear to result in part from their differing abilities to recruit RNA Pol II and to associate with histone deacetylases. Our findings indicate that ERG and the sarcoma fusion protein EWS/ERG differentially regulate expression of the COL11A2gene. Although both wild-type ERG and the EWS/ERG fusion protein share the same DNA-binding domain and are expected to bind to the same promoter sequence, the human COL11A2 promoter construct is transactivated by EWS/ERG but not by ERG. Recent reports have shown that EWS fusion proteins can inhibit expression of several genes (3Im Y.-H. Kim H.T. Lee C. Poulin D. Welford S. Sorensen P.H.B. Denny C.T. Kim S.-J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1536-1540Google Scholar,42Soldatenkov V.A. Trofimova I.N. Rouzaut A. McDermott F. Dritschilo A. Notario V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2890-2895Google Scholar). In contrast, our results together with a recent report on induction of the Id2 gene by EWS-ETS (43Nishimori H. Sasaki Y. Yoshida K. Irifune H. Zembutsu H. Tanaka T. Aoyama T. Hosaka T. Kawaguchi S. Wada T. Hata J. Toguchida J. Nakamura Y. Tokino T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8302-8309Google Scholar) reveal that an EWS fusion protein is able to activate an authentic promoter that is not activated by its wild-type partner. We also show that mutations within the tandem repeat of tcc trinucleotides of the COL11A2promoter sequence or within the ETS-DNA binding domain of EWS/ERG protein interfere with COL11A2 activation. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirm the direct interaction of EWS/ERG and/or ERG with theCOL11A2 promoter. Thus, transactivation is at least partially mediated by interaction between the COL11A2promoter and the DNA binding domain of EWS/ERG. In this study, we also investigated why EWS/ERG, but not ERG, transactivates COL11A2. Our study points to at least two potential mechanisms. First, since inhibition of histone deacetylase significantly enhanced the effects of ERG on COL11A2promoter activity, transactivation by ERG appears to be epigenetically suppressed. This is very similar to the proposed mechanism for Fli-1 inhibition of COL1A2 transcription (25Czuwara-Ladykowska J. Shirasaki F. Jackers P. Watson D.K. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20839-20848Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies have shown that a murine Kruppel-associated box-zinc finger protein represses Col11a2 promoter activity (44Tanaka K. Tsumaki N. Kozak C.A. Matsumoto Y. Nakatani F. Iwamoto Y. Yamada Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4256-4267Google Scholar), and human ESET (also called SETDB1) is known to bind to the universal, obligatory corepressor of Kruppel-associated box-zinc finger proteins (45Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Negorev D. Maul G.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 919-932Google Scholar). On the other hand, a recent study showed that the N-terminal region of wild-type EWS interacts with CREB-binding protein that has histone acetyltransferase activity (6Araya N. Hirota K. Shimamoto Y. Miyagishi M. Yoshida E. Ishida J. Kaneko S. Kaneko M. Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5427-5432Google Scholar). It may be that EWS/ERG also associates with CREB-binding protein and promotes derepression of transcription via acetylation of histones bound to its target promoters. Second, as evidenced by immunoprecipitation experiments, EWS/ERG fusion protein recruits RNA Pol II in vivo, whereas wild-type ERG does not. By fusing the N terminus of EWS to the DNA-binding domain of ERG, the EWS/ERG oncogenic protein is able to recruit RNA Pol II directly to the site of transcription, and this could serve to bypass suppression by histone deacetylase complexes. These findings therefore provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying collagen gene expression in general and COL11A2expression in particular. In addition to transcriptional deregulation, EWS sarcoma fusion proteins are reported to interfere with basic cellular processes such as RNA splicing. Unlike wild-type EWS protein, the C-terminal domains of EWS fusion products are unable to recruit serine-arginine splicing factors (5Yang L. Chansky H.A. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37612-37618Google Scholar), which may partly explain the abnormal splicing patterns in Ewing's sarcoma cells. The finding that EWS/ERG binds RNA Pol II also suggests a coupled mechanism for stimulated gene expression and altered RNA splicing. Since gene transcription and RNA splicing are physically linked via the RNA Pol II holoenzyme, EWS/ERG has the potential to deregulate gene activation, epigenetic gene repression, and RNA splicing. All of these processes are integral to cell growth and differentiation. The expression of COL11A2 in CADO-ES1 cells supports a neural/mesenchymal origin of Ewing's sarcoma (10Kodama K. Doi O. Higashiyama M. Yokouchi H. Tateishi R. Mori Y. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 335-338Google Scholar, 46Goji J. Sano K. Nakamura H. Ito H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4214-4220Google Scholar). Interestingly, the regulatory elements of the COL11A2 active in CADO-ES1 cells differ from those active in cells of cartilage and neural lineages (12Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Tanaka K. Kimura J.H. Ochi T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22861-22864Google Scholar, 47Bridgewater L.C. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14998-15006Google Scholar). The COL11A2 promoter shares many features with certain housekeeping promoters (23Lui V.C.H. Ng L.J. Sat E.W.Y. Cheah K.S.E. Genomics. 1996; 32: 401-412Google Scholar), such as the presence of G/C-rich sequences, the absence of a TATA box, and multiple transcription start sites. Similar to the findings here with theCOL11A2 promoter, the TATA-less, GC-rich promoters of the human heparanase-1 and the mouse thymidylate synthase genes are synergistically regulated by ETS family transcription factors and the Sp1 protein (48Jiang P. Kumar A. Parrillo J.E. Dempsey L.A. Platt J.L. Prinz R.A. Xu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8989-8998Google Scholar, 49Rudge T.L. Johnson L.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 274: 45-55Google Scholar). It is likely that other genes with promoter properties in common with COL11A2 are also differentially regulated by EWS/ERG and ERG, and the implications, we believe, are therefore fundamental to an understanding of Ewing's tumor pathobiology. We thank Drs. Ken Kodama for the CADO-ES1 cells, Mirka M. Vuoristo for cosmid clone 505-1, Ituro Inoue for a PAC clone containing the human COL11A2 region, and Kristin Rosler for technical assistance in the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay."

In this report, we investigated the posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulation of C/EBPδ in G0 growth-arrested mouse MECs. The results of transcriptional inhibitor studies demonstrated that the C/EBPδ mRNA exhibits a relatively short half-life in G0growth-arrested mouse MECs (t 12 ∼35 min). In contrast, C/EBPδ mRNA has a longer half-life in G0 growth-arrested mouse fibroblast cells (t 12 >100 min). Oligo/RNase H cleavage analysis and rapid amplification of cDNA ends-poly(A) test both confirmed the short C/EBPδ mRNA half-life observed in MECs and demonstrated that the C/EBPδ mRNA poly(A) tail is relatively short (∼100 nucleotides). In addition, the poly(A) tail length was not shortened during C/EBPδ mRNA degradation, which suggested a deadenylation-independent pathway. The C/EBPδ protein also exhibited a relatively short half-life in G0growth-arrested mouse MECs (t 12 ∼120 min). The C/EBPδ protein was degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent manner, primarily in the nucleus, during G0 growth arrest. In conclusion, these studies indicated that the C/EBPδ mRNA and protein content are under tight regulation in G0 growth-arrested mouse MECs, despite the general concept that G0 growth arrest is associated with a decrease in cellular activity.

Levis R. Abelson H.T. Green H. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 933-938Google Scholar, 2Johnson L.F. Williams J.G. Abelson H.T. Green H. Penman S. Cell. 1975; 4: 69-75Google Scholar). However, a small subset of genes become activated, and these gene products function in the initiation and maintenance of G0 growth arrest (3Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Google Scholar, 4Zhu L. Skoultchi A.I. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2001; 11: 91-97Google Scholar). Currently, little is known about the regulation and function of G0 growth arrest-specific genes in cell biology. Recently, an increase in expression and activity of the retinoblastoma (Rb) family member p130 was observed in the initiation and maintenance of G0 growth arrest (5Smith E.J. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6965-6976Google Scholar). Formation of the p130-E2F complex sequesters members of the E2F family to repress the expression of genes necessary for cellular proliferation. Alterations in the structure and function of G0 growth arrest genes are linked to some types of cancers. For example, germ line mutations found within the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene have been linked to hemangioblastomas of the retina and central nervous system and renal carcinogenesis (6Pause A. Lee S. Lonergan K.M. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 993-998Google Scholar). The von Hippel-Lindau protein functions in cell cycle control in a variety of ways, including up-regulating the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (7Davidowitz E.J. Schoenfeld A.R. Burk R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 865-874Google Scholar). Previous reports from our laboratory (8Gigliotti A.P. DeWille J.W. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 58: 57-63Google Scholar, 9Gigliotti A.P. DeWille J.W.

C/EBPδ mRNA, protein, and DNA binding activity increase during mouse MEC G0 growth arrest (11O'Rourke J. Yuan R. DeWille J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6291-6296Google Scholar, 12O'Rourke J.P.

STAT3 activation/phosphorylation is necessary for C/EBPδ transcription in G0 growth-arrested and cytokine-treated mouse MECs (10Hutt J.A. O'Rourke J.P. DeWille J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29123-29131Google Scholar). In addition, the C/EBPδ promoter exhibits autoregulation during G0 growth arrest (12O'Rourke J.P. Hutt J.A. DeWille J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 696-701Google Scholar). C/EBPs are a widely expressed, highly conserved family of leucine zipper (bZIP)-type transcription factors (14Hurst H.C. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 123-168Google Scholar, 15Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Google Scholar). Most C/EBPs are encoded by intronless genes and exhibit a high degree of homology in the basic and bZIP regions (14Hurst H.C. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 123-168Google Scholar, 15Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Google Scholar). To date, six family members are characterized including C/EBPα, C/EBPβ (also called CRP2, NF-IL6, LAP, AGP/EBP, IL6BP, or NF-M), C/EBPδ (also called CRP3, NF-IL6b, and CELF), C/EBPε, C/EBPγ, and C/EBP-Homologous Protein10 (GADD153) (15Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Google Scholar). C/EBPs bind to DNA as homodimers or as heterodimers with other C/EBP family members or other bZIP proteins such as c-Fos and CREB/ATF (14Hurst H.C. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 123-168Google Scholar, 15Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Google Scholar). Functional C/EBP-binding sites are present in the promoters of genes that function in cell growth arrest (gadd45γ), cell growth (c-fos), and differentiation (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and β-casein) (16Croniger C. Leahy P. Reshef L. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31629-31632Google Scholar, 17Sealy L. Malone D. Pawlak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1744-1755Google Scholar, 18Jung N. Yi Y.W. Kim D.

C/EBPs are directly involved in the regulation of cell fate determination (20Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar, 21Ron D. Habener J.F.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Google Scholar) demonstrate that the sequential expression of C/EBPδ, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPα is required for optimal adipocyte differentiation. Further studies (28Ferrini J.B.

C/EBPβ also plays an essential role in ovarian granulosa cell biology and the development and differentiation of the mammary gland (22Robinson G.W. Johnson P.F. Hennighausen L. Sterneck E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1907-1916Google Scholar, 23Sterneck E. Tessarollo L. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2153-2162Google Scholar, 24Seagroves T.N. Lydon J.P. Hovey R.C. Vonderhaar B.K. Rosen J.M.

Hutt J. Sattler A. Gigliotti A. DeWille J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 357-370Google Scholar). Furthermore, C/EBPε functions in the development and differentiation of neutrophils and eosinophils (32Yamanaka R. Barlow C. Lekstrom-Himes J. Castilla L.H. Liu P.P. Eckhaus M. Decker T. Wynshaw-Boris A. Xanthopoulos K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13187-13192Google Scholar,33Nakajima H. Ihle J.N. Blood. 2001; 98: 897-905Google Scholar). Control of gene expression can occur at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, or posttranslational level (34Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Google Scholar, 35Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Google Scholar, 36Dice J.F. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 349-357Google Scholar, 37Wilkinson K.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 141-148Google Scholar). At the posttranscriptional level, mRNA stability is emerging as a key regulatory mechanism in cell cycle control and DNA damage repair (34Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Google Scholar,35Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Google Scholar, 38Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin.

For example, the stability of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible mRNA increases after exposure to DNA-damaging agents or other growth arrest treatments (40Jackman J. Alamo Jr., I. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5656-5662Google Scholar). In addition, the growth arrest-specific gene 5 (gas-5) exhibits a marked increase in mRNA stability in density-arrested NIH 3T3 cells versusexponentially growing and differentiating cells (41Coccia E.M. Cicala C. Charlesworth A. Ciccarelli C. Rossi G.B. Philipson L. Sorrentino V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3514-3521Google Scholar). Alterations in the posttranscriptional regulation of genes that function in cell growth control and cell cycle progression can play a crucial role in tumorigenesis (42Dixon D.A. Tolley N.D. King P.H. Nabors L.B. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1657-1665Google Scholar, 43Mendell J.T. Dietz H.C. Cell. 2001; 107: 411-414Google Scholar). For example, alterations of trans-acting factors that function in c-myc and c-myb mRNA turnover results in increased c-myc and c-mybmRNA stability, which is linked to acute myeloid leukemia (44Baer M.R. Augustinos P. Kinniburgh A.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 1319-1326Google Scholar). Additionally, an increase in the basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA half-life, due to defects in posttranscriptional regulation, has been implicated in a variety of human tumors (45Touriol C. Morillon A. Gensac M.C. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21402-21408Google Scholar). Although several reports demonstrate that C/EBPδ is regulated at the transcriptional level (12O'Rourke J.P. Hutt J.A. DeWille J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 696-701Google Scholar, 13O'Rourke J.P. Newbound G.C. Hutt J.A. DeWille J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16582-16589Google Scholar), posttranscriptional control of C/EBPδ has not been investigated extensively. In addition to posttranscriptional control, several genes that play critical roles in cell cycle control are regulated posttranslationally, at the level of protein degradation (46Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Google Scholar, 47Nakayama K.I. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 853-860Google Scholar, 48Pagano M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1067-1075Google Scholar, 49Conaway R.C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Science. 2002; 296: 1254-1258Google Scholar). For example, the rate of p27 protein degradation decreases in response to growth arrest, which results in an accumulation of p27 protein (50Hengst L. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Google Scholar, 51Shirane M. Harumiya Y. Ishida N. Hirai A. Miyamoto C. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13886-13893Google Scholar). Blocking ubiquitination-dependent protein degradation increases p27 protein half-life and demonstrates that the p27 protein is degraded via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (52Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Google Scholar, 53Tsvetkov L.M. Yeh K.H. Lee S.J. Sun H. Zhang H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 661-664Google Scholar). In addition, increased p53 protein stability occurs during cellular genotoxic stress (54Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Google Scholar). This is accomplished by N-terminal phosphorylation of the p53 protein, which decreases the degree of ubiquitination and increases protein stability (54Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that cellular proteins may be degraded by ubiquitin-mediated mechanisms localized to either the nucleus or cytoplasm (55Tanaka K. Yoshimura T. Tamura T. Fujiwara T. Kumatori A. Ichihara A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 41-46Google Scholar, 56Rivett A.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 110-114Google Scholar). Nuclear localized ubiquitin-mediated degradation appears to provide a rapid mechanism for the disposal of nuclear cell cycle regulatory proteins (57Shirangi T.R. Zaika A. Moll U.M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 420-422Google Scholar). For example, the tumor suppressor protein product, p53, is degraded within the nucleus via a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway during post-stress recovery (57Shirangi T.R. Zaika A. Moll U.M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 420-422Google Scholar). The overall goal of this study was to investigate the posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulation of C/EBPδ in G0 growth-arrested mouse MECs. Our laboratory has reported previously (12O'Rourke J.P. Hutt J.A. DeWille J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 696-701Google Scholar) that C/EBPδ exhibits increased transcription and growth suppressor activity in G0 growth-arrested mouse MECs. However, the posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulation of C/EBPδ has not been systematically investigated. Previous studies (35Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Google Scholar) have demonstrated that key cell cycle regulatory proteins are encoded by unstable mRNAs. Because G0 growth arrest is associated with a period of decreased cellular activity, we hypothesized that both the C/EBPδ mRNA and protein would exhibit extended half-lives in G0 growth-arrested MECs. Unexpectedly, the results demonstrate that C/EBPδ mRNA exhibited a novel short mRNA half-life in G0 growth-arrested mouse MECs (t 12 ∼35 min) and contained a relatively short poly(A) tail of ∼100 nucleotides. In addition, the C/EBPδ protein also exhibited a short half-life in G0growth-arrested mouse MECs (t 12 ∼120 min). Furthermore, ubiquitination inhibitor studies indicated that C/EBPδ protein degradation is ubiquitin-dependent and occurs predominantly within the nucleus. The results of these studies demonstrate that the C/EBPδ mRNA and protein are under tight regulation in G0 growth-arrested MECs, suggesting that C/EBPδ plays a key role in mouse MEC growth control. The nontransformed HC11 mouse MEC line (a kind gift from Dr. Wolfgang Doppler, Universitat Innsbruck, Austria) was cultured in complete growth media (CGM) consisting of RPMI 1640 (4.5 g/liter glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 10 μg/ml insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 500 ng/ml Fungizone (Invitrogen). NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in growth media consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 10 μg/ml insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 500 ng/ml Fungizone (Invitrogen). C/EBPδ overexpression HC11 MECs were maintained as described previously (13O'Rourke J.P. Newbound G.C. Hutt J.A. DeWille J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16582-16589Google Scholar). Selection media included the addition of G418 (350 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). For growth arrest experiments, MECs were grown to 80% confluence, washed with serum-free media, and cultured in growth arrest media (GAM) supplemented with 0.1% FBS. Transcriptional inhibitor studies utilized both actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) and 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1-β-d-ribofuranoside (DRB) (5 μg/ml) (Sigma), and translational inhibitor studies utilized anisomycin (10 μg/ml) (Sigma). Ubiquitination inhibitor studies utilized MG-132 (5 μg/ml) and N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Norleu-Al (LLnL) (50 μg/ml) (Sigma). Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Thirty μg of total RNA was analyzed by Northern blot analysis as described previously (11O'Rourke J. Yuan R. DeWille J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6291-6296Google Scholar). The following [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNAs were used as probes: C/EBPδ, C/EBPβ (kind gifts from Dr. Steven McKnight, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas), gas-1, c-fos (ATCC, Manassas, VA), bovine growth hormone, and cyclophilin (Continental Laboratory Products Inc., San Diego, CA). Membranes were visualized by autoradiography or by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) analysis. Northern blot quantification was performed with AlphaImager 2000 Documentation & Analysis System software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). To determine the mRNA half-life of C/EBPδ, C/EBPβ, and gas-1, values obtained from densitometric analysis were converted to a percentage of the control time (“0” min) and graphs were plotted as “% mRNA remaining versus time.” MECs were washed twice in cold 1% phosphate-buffered saline, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, pelleted by centrifugation, and subjected to whole cell protein isolation using a RIPA buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmPMSF, 1× Complete Protease Inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In addition, the following kinase and phosphatase inhibitors were added: 100 mm NaF, 100 mm NaVO3, 100 mm Na2MnO4, and 1 μm okadaic acid. Samples were placed in an Eppendorf shaker for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was recovered after centrifugation. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to electrophoresis on 12.5% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) at 150 V for 2 h. Blots were blocked for 60 min in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 10% non-fat dry milk. Blots were subsequently incubated for 60 min in PBST containing 5% non-fat dry milk and primary antisera against C/EBPδ (Santa Cruz Biochemicals, Santa Cruz, CA), p27 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), Bcl-x (Santa Cruz Biochemicals), and actin (Santa Cruz Biochemicals) (1:1000). Blots were washed in PBST, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (1:2000) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). For nuclear and cytoplasmic protein isolation, MECs were isolated in Dignam buffers (nuclear buffer: 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.42 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 1× complete protease inhibitors, 100 mm NaF, 100 mm NaVO3, 100 mmNa2MnO4, and 1 μm okadaic acid; cytoplasmic buffer: 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 1× complete protease, 100 mm NaF, 100 mm NaVO3, 100 mm Na2MnO4, and 1 μmokadaic acid). Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein lysates were analyzed as described for whole cell protein preparations. Western blot quantification was performed with AlphaImager 2000 Documentation & Analysis System software (Alpha Innotech). To determine protein half-life, C/EBPδ values obtained from densitometric analysis were converted to a percentage of the control time (0 min) and graphs were plotted as “% protein remaining versus time.” Five μg of total RNA was used to synthesize C/EBPδ cDNA using the Superscript First-strand Synthesis for RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). C/EBPδ cDNA was subsequently used to set up standard PCR (5 min at 93 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 93 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, and a 7-min extension at 72 °C) using an end-labeled [γ-32P]dATP C/EBPδ upstream primer (5′-CCATTGCAGCTAAGGTACAT-3′) and an oligo(dT) anchor downstream primer (5′-GGGGATCCGCGGTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) (58Salles F.J. Richards W.G. Strickland S. Methods (Orlando). 1999; 17: 38-45Google Scholar). Labeled PCR products were run on 5% polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C for 5 h at 100 V in 0.5% TBE buffer. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Ten μg of total RNA and oligomers complementary to the 3′ end of the C/EBPδ mRNA (5′-CCAAAGAAACTAGCGATTCGGG-3′) to the β-globin mRNA (5′-GATCCACGTGCAGCTTGTCA-3′) or the poly(A) tail (poly(dT)12–18) were denatured at 65 °C for 10 min. A digestion mixture (4 μl of 5× buffer (200 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)), 1 unit of RNase H (Invitrogen) and 1 μl of RNasin (40 units/μl) (Promega, Madison, WI), in 20-μl reactions) was added to each sample and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min (58Salles F.J. Richards W.G. Strickland S. Methods (Orlando). 1999; 17: 38-45Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped with 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and precipitated with 0.1 volume of 3 m NaOAc and 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol. Samples were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in Northern blot tracking dye, and subsequently analyzed by Northern blot analysis as described previously (11O'Rourke J. Yuan R. DeWille J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6291-6296Google Scholar). To investigate the posttranscriptional regulation of the C/EBPδ mRNA in mouse HC11 MECs, we utilized transcriptional inhibitors followed by Northern blot analysis. Briefly, confluent HC11 MECs were G0growth-arrested by serum and growth factor withdrawal. After 48 h, HC11 MECs were either maintained in growth arrest medium alone (GAM−) or in GAM with the addition of the transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D (GAM+) for the indicated times. mRNA half-life was analyzed for a panel of cellular mRNAs including cyclophilin (cp), which was used to confirm equal loading. Consistent with previous reports from our laboratory, C/EBPδ mRNA was detected in G0 growth-arrested HC11 MECs (Fig.1 A, lanes 1–4). C/EBPδ mRNA levels rapidly declined with a half-life of ∼35 min (t 12 ∼35 min) following actinomycin D treatment (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5–8 and Fig. 1 C). After 60 min of actinomycin D treatment, C/EBPδ mRNA was undetectable (Fig. 1 A, lane 7). Similar results were observed with a second transcriptional inhibitor, DRB (Fig.1 B). In addition to C/EBPδ, we also investigated the mRNA level of another C/EBP family member, C/EBPβ. Reports from a number of laboratories, including our own, demonstrate that C/EBPβ plays a significant role in mammary gland growth and differentiation (22Robinson G.W. Johnson P.F. Hennighausen L. Sterneck E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1907-1916Google Scholar, 24Seagroves T.N. Lydon J.P. Hovey R.C. Vonderhaar B.K. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 359-368Google Scholar,25Seagroves T.N.

Biochem. 2001; 82: 357-370Google Scholar). C/EBPβ mRNA was detected in G0growth-arrested HC11 MECs, suggesting that C/EBPβ also plays a role in G0 growth arrest (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–4). C/EBPβ mRNA levels declined with a half-life of ∼45 min following the addition of actinomycin D (Fig. 1 A,lanes 5–8, and Fig. 1 C). gas-1 mRNA levels are known to be induced during G0 growth arrest of NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells (59Del Sal G. Ruaro M.E. Philipson L. Schneider C. Cell. 1992; 70: 595-607Google Scholar, 60Schneider C. King R.M. Philipson L. Cell. 1988; 54: 787-793Google Scholar, 61Ciccarelli C. Philipson L. Sorrentino V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1525-1529Google Scholar). In this report, gas-1 mRNA was also detected in G0 growth-arrested HC11 MECs (Fig. 1 A,lanes 1–4). Addition of actinomycin D reducedgas-1 mRNA levels (t 12 ∼75 min) (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5–8, and Fig.1 C). Compared with C/EBPδ, gas-1 mRNA was relatively stable during G0 growth arrest. In agreement with previous work, c-fos, an immediate early gene that is induced at the G0/G1 transition, was undetectable at the mRNA level in G0 growth-arrested HC11 MECs (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–4). In summary, results of transcriptional inhibitor studies indicate that C/EBPδ mRNA is highly unstable during G0 growth arrest in HC11 MECs. C/EBPβ, which has been associated previously with cellular proliferation and differentiation, also exhibits a relatively short mRNA half-life in G0 growth-arrested HC11 MECs. In contrast, gas-1 mRNA is more stable during G0 growth arrest. Overall, the results suggest that the C/EBPδ mRNA is undergoing rapid turnover despite the general decline in global gene expression and biosynthetic activity during G0 growth arrest. Cell cycle re-entry requires coordination between the inactivation and/or disposal of G0-specific proteins and the expression of early G1 genes, such as c-fos and c-myc. To investigate the posttranscriptional regulation of C/EBPδ mRNA during early G1, mRNA levels were analyzed from HC11 MECs upon addition of complete growth media alone (CGM−) or CGM plus actinomycin D (CGM+) at the indicated time points. In agreement with previous reports from our laboratory, C/EBPδ mRNA levels decline with the onset of G1 and the initiation of the cell cycle (Fig.2, lanes 1–4) (41Coccia E.M. Cicala C. Charlesworth A. Ciccarelli C. Rossi G.B. Philipson L. Sorrentino V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3514-3521Google Scholar). C/EBPδ mRNA levels also decreased in early G1 following actinomycin D treatment; however, the cell cycle-induced decline of C/EBPδ mRNA was delayed compared with the decline observed in G0 growth arrest (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8). When G0 growth-arrested HC11 MECs were induced to re-enter the cell cycle by CGM addition, C/EBPβ mRNA levels increased ∼10-fold within the first 90 min (Fig. 2, lane 1–4). This induction of C/EBPβ mRNA levels during early G1 is consistent with a growth-promoting role for C/EBPβ. The addition of actinomycin D blocked the growth-stimulated induction of C/EBPβ mRNA, which suggests that C/EBPβ transcription plays a major role in the increase in C/EBPβ mRNA levels during early G1in HC11 MECs (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8). gas-1 mRNA levels also declined after G0growth-arrested HC11 MECs were induced to re-enter the cell cycle by refeeding with CGM (Fig. 2, lanes 1–4). Interestingly, addition of CGM and actinomycin D stabilized the gas-1mRNA, resulting in high levels of gas-1 mRNA even at 90 min (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8). In agreement with previous reports, c-fos mRNA was transiently induced following the addition of CGM and the initiation of the cell cycle (Fig. 2,lanes 1–4). The induction of c-fos mRNA was blocked by actinomycin D treatment, indicating that c-fosgene transcription is required for the increase in c-fosmRNA during early G1 (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8). The results of the transcriptional inhibitor studies during cell cycle re-entry de"
https://openalex.org/W2097616911,"The cAMP response element modulator (CREM) plays pivotal roles in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. CREM mRNA is robustly expressed in human myocardium, and identified isoforms may suppress cAMP response element-mediated transcription. However, little is known about the physiological importance of CREM in intact hearts remains unknown. We studied CREM-null mice and age-matched control littermates by in vivo pressure-volume loops to analyze basal and reserve cardiac function. Basal systolic and diastolic function, echocardiographic morphology, and myocardial histology were normal in CREM-null animals. However functional reserve with increasing heart rate was markedly depressed, with less contractile augmentation (+22+/-9% CREM-/- vs.+62+/-11% controls, P<0.05) and relaxation shortening (5+/-5% CREM-/- vs. -18+/-3% controls; P<0.05) at faster rates. In contrast, isoproterenol dose-responses were similar, suggesting normal beta-adrenergic receptor-coupled signaling. Gene expression of calcium handling proteins (SERCA, phospholamban) and stress-response genes (e.g., alpha-skeletal actin, beta-myosin heavy chain, natriuretic peptides) were similar between groups. However, total and serine-phosphorylated phospholamban protein declined -38 and -64% respectively, and protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) activity increased 44% without increased protein levels (all P<0.01) in CREM-/- vs. controls. These results demonstrate novel involvement of CREM in regulation of PP1 activity and of PLB, likely resulting in a potent frequency-dependent influence on cardiac function."
https://openalex.org/W2077167273,"γ-SolubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein (γ-SNAP) is capable of stabilizing a 20 S complex consisting of NSF, α-SNAP, and SNAP receptors (SNAREs), but its function in vesicular transport is not fully understood. Our two-hybrid analysis revealed that γ-SNAP, unlike α-SNAP, interacts directly with NSF, as well as Gaf-1/Rip11, but not with SNAREs. Gaf-1/Rip11 is a γ-SNAP-associated factor that belongs to the Rab11-interacting protein family. To gain insight into the molecular basis for the interactions of γ-SNAP with NSF and Gaf-1/Rip11, we determined the regions of the three proteins involved in protein-protein interactions. γ-SNAP bound to NSF via its extreme C-terminal region, and the full-length NSF was needed to interact with γ-SNAP. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of γ-SNAP were required for the binding to Gaf-1/Rip11. Gaf-1/Rip11 bound to γ-SNAP via its C-terminal domain comprising a putative coiled-coil region. Although the C-terminal domain of Gaf-1/Rip11 also interacts with Rab11, the binding of γ-SNAP and Rab11 to Gaf-1/Rip11 was not mutually exclusive. Rather, Gaf-1/Rip11 was capable of serving a link between γ-SNAP and Rab11. A complex comprising γ-SNAP and Gaf-1/Rip11 was disassembled in a process coupled to NSF-mediated ATP hydrolysis, suggesting that the interaction between γ-SNAP and Gaf-1/Rip11 is of functional significance. γ-SolubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein (γ-SNAP) is capable of stabilizing a 20 S complex consisting of NSF, α-SNAP, and SNAP receptors (SNAREs), but its function in vesicular transport is not fully understood.

Although the precise molecular mechanism for membrane fusion is not fully understood, one current model predicts that membrane fusion is driven by a tight binding between vesicle-associated SNAREs (the VAMP/synaptobrevin family) and target membrane-associated SNAREs (the syntaxin and SNAP-25 families) (5Weber T.

Given the high sequence similarity between α-SNAP and β-SNAP, it is postulated that the function of β-SNAP is quite similar to that of α-SNAP.

The results suggest that γ-SNAP interacts with NSF via its extreme C-terminal region, whereas the N-terminal and C-terminal regions are required for the interaction with Gaf-1/Rip11. In addition, we showed a complex comprising γ-SNAP and Gaf-1/Rip11 is disassembled in a process coupled to NSF-mediated ATP hydrolysis. A Gaf-1/Rip11 fragment (amino acids 524–653) and the full-length γ-SNAP were expressed as His6-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli cells and purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). The isolated proteins were injected into rabbits to produce antisera. Monoclonal antibodies against Rab11 (clone 47; Transduction Laboratories), γ-tubulin (GTU-88; Accurate Chemical and Scientific Co.), FLAG (M2; Sigma), and GST (Clontech) were obtained. A polyclonal antibody against GST was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. A monoclonal antibody against c-Myc (clone 9E10) was purified from ascitic fluid and cross-linked to protein G beads using dimethyl pimelimidate. A monoclonal antibody against NSF (2E5) was prepared as described (28Tagaya M. Wilson D. Brunner M. Arango N. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2662-2666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pQE9, pQE30, and pQE31 were purchased from Qiagen and used for the expression of His6-tagged proteins. pGEX-4T-1 was obtained from Amersham Biosciences and used for the expression of GST fusion proteins. The clone KIAA0857 was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Kisarazu, Japan. pEBG (29Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and pFLAG-CMV2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) were used for the expression of proteins in mammalian cells. The cDNA encoding γ-SNAP was a generous gift from Dr. S. W. Whiteheart (University of Kentucky College of Medicine). The plasmids for Myc-tagged Rab11Q70L and Rab11S25N were kindly donated by Dr. Y. Takai (Osaka University). The full-length cDNA of γ-SNAP was inserted into pGBT9, and the resultant plasmid was used as bait. A GAL4 DNA activation domain fusion library in pACT2 (MATCHMAKER human kidney cDNA library; Clontech) was used to isolate interacting clones. Yeast colonies that grew in medium lacking histidine were picked up, and their β-galactosidase activity was assayed on filters. To examine protein-protein interactions, cDNAs for γ-SNAP and α-SNAP were inserted into the bait plasmid pGBT9, and cDNAs for NSF and Gaf-1/Rip11 were inserted into the prey plasmid pGAD424. β-Galactosidase activity was measured after transformation of yeast with the indicated combinations of the bait and prey plasmids. Recombinant GST proteins were mixed with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B and then the mixture was gently rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. After the beads were washed, they were incubated with His6-tagged proteins in incubation buffer comprising 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm ATP, 10% glycerol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rotation. The beads were washed three times with incubation buffer devoid of bovine serum albumin, and the bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 5 mm glutathione. The eluted proteins were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid-deoxycholate precipitation and then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Transfection of cells and preparation of cell lysates were performed as described (30Tani K. Mizoguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For co-transfection, plasmids (1 μg each) were used. At 20 h after transfection, cells plated on 35-mm dishes were washed and then lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer comprising 25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μmpepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation. To the supernatants was added 3–5 μg of an antibody. After 30 min on ice, 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4B was added to the mixtures and then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle rotation. The beads were washed with lysis buffer several times and then the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 10 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For pull-down experiments, cell lysates were mixed with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B and then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle rotation. The beads were washed, and the bound proteins were eluted as described above. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After incubation with appropriate primary antibodies and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the membranes were developed on autoradiographic film by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Livers were removed from starved rats, rinsed, perfused, and weighed. They were cut into small pieces and homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (5 strokes) in 4 volumes of homogenization buffer comprising 25 mmHEPES/KOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm (Tomy TA-4 rotor) for 10 min and then at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 33,000 rpm (Beckman 50.2Ti rotor) for 1 h to recover membranes. Velocity sedimentation was performed essentially as described (7Wilson D.W. Whiteheart S.W. Wiedmann M. Brunner M. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Rat liver membranes (1.0 mg) were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation. The membrane extracts (220 μl) were mixed with His6-tagged NSF (3 μg) and His6-tagged γ-SNAP (0.7 μg), and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. When indicated, 1 mMgCl2 was added to the mixture at a final concentration of 8 mm. The mixture was layered on the top of glycerol gradients consisting of 0.4 ml each of gradient buffer containing 35, 32.5, 30, 27.5, 25, 22.5, 20, 17.5, 15, and 12.5% glycerol (w/v). After centrifugation at 34,000 rpm (Beckman SW50 rotor) for 13 h, fractions (0.4 ml each) were recovered from the top. The proteins of the gradient fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and deoxycholate, washed with acetone, and then dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Cells expressing GST-Gaf-1/Rip11 and FLAG-tagged γ-SNAP, cultured on 35-mm dishes, were lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer. The lysates were mixed with an equal volume of cell lysates separately prepared from non-transfected cells. When indicated, 1 m MgCl2 was added to the mixture at a final concentration of 8 mm. The mixture was incubated at 16 °C for 1 h and then GST-Gaf-1/Rip11 was pulled down with glutathione beads. The proteins pulled down were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against GST and FLAG. For the preparation of NEM-treated cell lysates, non-transfected cells were lysed in lysis buffer devoid of dithiothreitol. The cell lysates were incubated with 1 mm NEM on ice for 15 min followed by 15 min treatment with 2 mm dithiothreitol to quench excess NEM. To identify γ-SNAP-interacting proteins other than Gaf-1/Rip11 (20Chen D. Xu W. He P. Medrano E.E. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13127-13135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we screened a human kidney expression library using the full-length γ-SNAP as bait. Screening two times yielded 68 positive clones. Among the clones obtained, 20 clones encoded Gaf-1/Rip11, and 24 appeared to encode its alternative splice variant, because the encoded protein possesses the same C-terminal 131 amino acid residues as Gaf-1/Rip11 but has a different N-terminal sequence. Characterization of the putative splice variant will be described elsewhere. Fifteen clones were found to comprise the entire coding region of NSF. Proteins encoded by the other nine clones were different from one another. One was cytosolic thiolase, which was also identified as a potential γ-SNAP-interacting protein in a two-hybrid screen by Chen et al. (20Chen D. Xu W. He P. Medrano E.E. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13127-13135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because the direct interaction between γ-SNAP and NSF was not reported previously, we decided to analyze the interaction in detail. We first generated γ-SNAP mutants encoding the N-terminal half (amino acids 1–152) and the C-terminal one (amino acids 153–312). A two-hybrid assay revealed that the C-terminal region is responsible for the interaction with NSF (Fig. 1A). We then generated a series of mutants with C-terminal deletions. When two amino acids were removed from the C terminus, the interaction between γ-SNAP and NSF was abolished. To examine whether the two C-terminal residues, Leu-311 and Cys-312, directly contribute to the interaction with NSF, we replaced them individually and both by Ala via site-directed mutagenesis. The results showed that both the residues are important for the interaction with NSF (Fig. 1A). To confirm the results of the two-hybrid analysis, we performed anin vitro binding assay using isolated bacterial proteins. To facilitate purification, NSF was expressed as a His6-tagged protein, and γ-SNAP was expressed as a GST fusion protein. Consistent with the results of the two-hybrid analysis, His6-tagged NSF was pulled down with GST-γ-SNAP (full-length) (Fig.1B, lane 7) and GST-γ-SNAP (amino acids 153–312) (lane 9) but not with GST-γ-SNAP (amino acids 1–152) (lane 8). In addition, His6-tagged NSF was not pulled down with GST-γ-SNAP in which Leu-311 was replaced by Ala (L311A) (Fig. 1C, lane 8). Although His6-tagged NSF was pulled down with GST-γ-SNAP in which Cys-312 was replaced by Ala (C312A) (lane 9), the amount was smaller than that pulled down with wild-type GST-γ-SNAP. These results clearly showed that the extreme C-terminal region, especially Leu-311, is important for the interaction with NSF. We next determined the binding site for γ-SNAP on NSF. NSF can be divided into three domains, N-terminal and two ATP-binding domains referred to as D1 and D2 (28Tagaya M. Wilson D. Brunner M. Arango N. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2662-2666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29182-29188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid analysis and in vitro binding experiments revealed that the full-length NSF, but neither the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–205) nor the D1D2 domain (amino acids 206–744), binds to γ-SNAP (Fig.2). These results are consistent with the fact that only full-length NSF clones were obtained in the two-hybrid screen. α-SNAP interacts primarily with syntaxin and weakly with SNAP-25 (9Hanson P.I. Otto H. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16955-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 33McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2213-2217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our previous results (34Hatsuzawa K. Hirose H. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Scheller R.H. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13713-13720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) demonstrated that SNAREs can interact with α-SNAP in the yeast two-hybrid system even though they possess membrane anchors. The fact that clones encoding SNAREs were not obtained in the two-hybrid screen using γ-SNAP as bait may suggest that γ-SNAP does not interact directly with SNAREs. Indeed, a two-hybrid assay demonstrated that γ-SNAP does not interact with various syntaxins, cellubrevin (a ubiquitously expressed protein of the VAMP-2 family) (35McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), or SNAP-23 (a ubiquitously expressed protein of the SNAP-25 family) (36Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) (Table I). These observations raised the possibility that γ-SNAP is incorporated into the NSF-α-SNAP-SNAREs complex through binding to NSF. To test this possibility, we carried out velocity sedimentation analysis. Triton X-100 extracts of rat liver membranes were incubated with purified recombinant His6-NSF and His6-γ-SNAP in the presence or absence of Mg2+-ATP, and the mixtures were then subjected to velocity centrifugation. As shown in Fig.3A, significant amounts of endogenous and recombinant His6-γ-SNAP co-sedimented with NSF in the absence of Mg2+ (fractions 7–9). In contrast, no co-sedimentation was observed in the presence of Mg2+(Fig. 3B). These results were essentially the same as those reported previously (7Wilson D.W. Whiteheart S.W. Wiedmann M. Brunner M. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In the case of a γ-SNAP mutant (L311A) that is defective in the ability to bind to NSF, no co-sedimentation with NSF was observed even in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig.3C), suggesting that the interaction with NSF is essential for γ-SNAP to be incorporated into the 20 S complex.Table IInteraction between SNAPs and SNAREs in the two-hybrid systemSyntaxin 4Syntaxin 5M2Syntaxin 7Syntaxin 181-aA fragment of syntaxin 18 (amino acids 82–335) was used.CellubrevinSNAP-23α-SNAP+++++++ND1-bNot determined.NDγ-SNAP−−−−−−α-SNAP and γ-SNAP were inserted into pGBT9 (bait plasmid), and SNAREs were inserted into pGAD424 (prey plasmid).

Open table in a new tab α-SNAP and γ-SNAP were inserted into pGBT9 (bait plasmid), and SNAREs were inserted into pGAD424 (prey plasmid). After co-transformation of yeast with the indicated combinations of the bait and prey plasmids, β-galactosidase activity was measured. To gain insight into the mechanism governing the interaction between γ-SNAP and Gaf-1/Rip11, we determined the region of Gaf-1/Rip11 involved in the association with γ-SNAP. The binding site for γ-SNAP on Gaf-1/Rip11 must be within its C-terminal 131 amino acids, because the C-terminal region common to Gaf-1/Rip11 and its putative alternative splice variant interacts with γ-SNAP in the two-hybrid system. We constructed a series of C-terminal fragments of Gaf-1/Rip11 and performed a yeast two-hybrid assay using the full-length γ-SNAP as bait (Fig. 4A). The results confined the region responsible for the interaction with γ-SNAP to amino acids 590–640 of Gaf-1/Rip11. This region comprises a putative coiled-coil region (amino acids 608–640), but the coiled-coil region alone was not sufficient to interact with γ-SNAP. To confirm this observation, we constructed plasmids to express amino acids 590–640 and 608–640 of Gaf-1/Rip11 as GST fusion proteins and γ-SNAP as a FLAG-tagged protein and performed pull-down experiments after co-transfection of the plasmids into 293T cells (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the results of the yeast two-hybrid analysis, FLAG-tagged γ-SNAP was pulled down with the GST fusion protein comprising amino acids 590–640 of Gaf-1/Rip11 (lane 6) but not with that comprising amino acids 608–640 (lane 5). A previous study revealed that Gaf-1/Rip11 is associated with γ-tubulin (20Chen D. Xu W. He P. Medrano E.E. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13127-13135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly, endogenous γ-tubulin was efficiently pulled down with the construct comprising amino acids 608–640, which could not interact with γ-SNAP, suggesting that this region is sufficient to interact with γ-tubulin. The fact that the amount of γ-tubulin bound to the construct containing amino acids 590–640 of Gaf-1/Rip11 was trivial compared with that bound to the construct containing amino acids 608–640 may imply that expressed FLAG-tagged γ-SNAP competed with endogenous γ-tubulin for the binding to the construct containing amino acids 590–640 of Gaf-1/Rip11. To determine the region of γ-SNAP involved in the interaction with Gaf-1/Rip11, we performed a two-hybrid assay using γ-SNAP or its deletion mutants as bait. The results are summarized in Fig.5A. Deletion of N-terminal 23 amino acids or C-terminal 89 amino acids eliminated the interaction with Gaf-1/Rip11. Similar results were obtained when pull-down experiments were conducted using a mammalian expression system (Fig.5B). Members of the Rab11-interacting protein family share a highly conserved region of 20 amino acids at the C terminus (22Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38966-38970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) showed that a peptide corresponding to amino acids 628–645 of Gaf-1/Rip11 competes with Gaf-1/Rip11 protein for the binding to Rab11. Because the Rab11-binding domain on Gaf-1/Rip11 markedly overlaps with the γ-SNAP-binding domain, we wondered whether the γ-SNAP-binding domain can interact with Rab11. Myc-tagged Rab11 proteins and the full-length Gaf-1/Rip11 or its fragments fused to GST were expressed in 293T cells, and immunoprecipitation was performed by using an anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 6A, the γ-SNAP-binding domain (amino acids 590–640 of Gaf-1/Rip11) can interact with the constitutively active Rab11, Rab11Q70L (lane 9), although its interaction was markedly weaker than the interaction of the full-length Gaf-1/Rip11 (lane 10). Perhaps the C-terminal sequence (amino acids 641–645) of the Rab11-binding domain significantly contributes to the binding to Rab11. No interaction was observed with the inactive Rab11, Rab11S25N (lane 12). The coiled-coil region responsible for the interaction with γ-tubulin (amino acids 608–640 of Gaf-1/Rip11) did not bind to Rab11Q70L (lane 8). Given that Rab11 and γ-SNAP occupy the same region on Gaf-1/Rip11, we predicted that γ-SNAP inhibits the binding of Rab11 to Gaf-1/Rip11 in a competitive manner. However, when Myc-tagged Rab11Q70L, Gaf-1/Rip11, and FLAG-tagged γ-SNAP were co-expressed, Gaf-1/Rip11 was still co-precipitated with an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 6B,lane 5). Surprisingly, a small but significant amount of FLAG-tagged γ-SNAP was also co-precipitated with Myc-Rab11Q70L. On the other hand, no co-precipitation of FLAG-tagged γ-SNAP was observed with Myc-Rab11S25N even in the presence of Gaf-1/Rip11 (lane 6). It should be noted that expression of Gaf-1/Rip11 is prerequisite for the co-precipitation of γ-SNAP with Rab11Q70L (lane 7). These results suggest that Gaf-1/Rip11 is able to link between Rab11 and γ-SNAP, although the linkage efficiency is not high. The 20 S NSF-SNAPs-SNAREs complex is disassembled in a process coupled to NSF-mediated ATP hydrolysis (7Wilson D.W. Whiteheart S.W. Wiedmann M. Brunner M. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This most likely reflects disassembly of the cis SNARE complex after membrane fusion (1Wickner W. Haas A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 247-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 2Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 3Whiteheart S.W.

Biol. 2002; 18: 289-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We were interested in whether the binding between γ-SNAP and Gaf-1/Rip11 is also affected by NSF and α-SNAP in a Mg2+-ATP-dependent manner. To address this question, Triton X-100 extracts prepared from cells expressing FLAG-tagged γ-SNAP and GST-Gaf-1/Rip11 were mixed with lysates separately prepared from non-transfected cells, and the mixtures were incubated in the presence of EDTA-ATP or Mg2+-ATP. GST-Gaf-1/Rip11 in the mixtures was pulled down, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.7, addition of Mg2+-ATP caused the dissociation of FLAG-tagged γ-SNAP from GST-Gaf-1/Rip11 (lane 9), implying the disassembly of the γ-SNAP-Gaf-1/Rip11 complex. Addition of cell lysates from non-transfected cells was necessary for efficient disassembly. It should be noted that FLAG-tagged γ-SNAP and GST-Gaf-1/Rip11 were overexpressed. Perhaps the cell lysates may supply membrane and cytosolic proteins required for the disassembly reaction under conditions in which γ-SNAP and Gaf-1/Rip11 were present at high levels. When cell lysates were pretreated with 1 mm NEM, no dissociation of FLAG-tagged γ-SNAP from GST-Gaf-1/Rip11 occurred (lane 13), indicating the requirement of NEM-sensitive component(s) for this process. Addition of His6-tagged NSF and His6-tagged α-SNAP restored the dissociation reaction (lane 15). These results unequivocally showed the requirement of NSF for the disassembly of the γ-SNAP-Gaf-1/Rip11 complex. In the present study we analyzed the interactions of γ-SNAP with NSF and Gaf-1/Rip11 in detail using the yeast two-hybrid system and isolated recombinant proteins or a mammalian expression system. Our results demonstrated that the extreme C-terminal region of γ-SNAP, especially Leu-311, is required for the interaction with NSF, and the N-terminal 23 amino acids and C-terminal 89 amino acids of γ-SNAP contribute to the binding to Gaf-1/Rip11. For the interaction with γ-SNAP, on the other hand, the entire coding region of NSF and the C-terminal region (amino acids 590–640) of Gaf-1/Rip11 are required. Although α-SNAP mediates the attachment of NSF to SNAREs (7Wilson D.W. Whiteheart S.W. Wiedmann M. Brunner M. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 8Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar), it appears that α-SNAP interacts with NSF only when it binds to SNAREs or plastic (12Barnard R.J.O. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 875-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Binding of α-SNAP to plastic may cause a conformational change in α-SNAP similar to that occurring upon binding to SNAREs. Consistent with the idea that SNAREs are required for the interaction of α-SNAP with NSF, no clones encoding NSF were obtained in our previous two-hybrid screen using α-SNAP as bait (34Hatsuzawa K. Hirose H. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Scheller R.H. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13713-13720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Indeed, our yeast two-hybrid assay showed that α-SNAP hardly interacts with NSF (data not shown). In contrast, γ-SNAP interacts with NSF in the absence of SNAREs. Despite this difference in the interactions between the two species of SNAPs and NSF, the penultimate leucine residues of the SNAPs (Leu-294 in α-SNAP and Leu-311 in γ-SNAP) are important for the binding to NSF. In comparison with α-SNAP, γ-SNAP appears to have a 22-amino acid insertion between the putative C-terminal α-helix, which corresponds to loop α14 in Sec17p (15Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the penultimate leucine. This extra sequence may shift the position of Leu-311 such that it can interact with NSF in the absence of SNAREs. Interestingly, replacements of the penultimate leucine residues cause opposite effects in terms of the binding to NSF. An α-SNAP mutant in which Leu-294 is replaced by Ala is able to interact with NSF in a 20 S complex but unable to fully disassemble the complex in the presence of Mg2+-ATP (12Barnard R.J.O. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 875-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In contrast, the corresponding γ-SNAP mutant is unable to bind to NSF. Gaf-1/Rip11 is a member of the recently identified Rab11-interacting protein family (22Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol.

Commun. 2002; 292: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The highly conserved C-terminal region of Rab11-interacting protein family members is responsible for the binding to Rab11. In the present study we revealed that the same or markedly overlapping region is capable of interacting with γ-SNAP. Despite the fact that Rab11 and γ-SNAP bind to the overlapping site on Gaf-1/Rip11, overexpression of γ-SNAP did not inhibit the binding of expressed Rab11 to Gaf-1/Rip11. Rather, a significant amount of γ-SNAP was co-precipitated with Rab11 in the presence of Gaf-1/Rip11, suggesting that Gaf-1/Rip11 is able to serve as a link between γ-SNAP and Rab11. How can Gaf-1/Rip11 connect γ-SNAP to Rab11? Members of the Rab11-interacting protein family including Gaf-1/Rip11 are known to possess extensive homo- and hetero-interacting abilities (27Wallace D.M. Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. McCaffrey M.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Using these abilities Gaf-1/Rip11 may constitute a scaffold or a hydrophobic patch (38Meyers J.M. Prekeris R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49003-49010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that can accommodate Rab11 and γ-SNAP. Obviously, members of the Rab11-interacting protein family bind many proteins. Rab11-FIP2, a member of the family, interacts not only with Rab11 but also with proteins involved in recycling and endocytosis such as myosin Vb, Reps1, and α-adaptin (24Hales C.M. Griner R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13127-13135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), as well as the present one, showed that Gaf-1/Rip11 binds γ-tubulin. Both N-terminal and C-terminal regions of γ-SNAP contribute to the binding to Gaf-1/Rip11. Interestingly, the corresponding regions of α-SNAP are known to interact with SNAREs (9Hanson P.I. Otto H. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16955-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 40Hayashi T. Yamasaki S. Nauenburg S. Binz T. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Because γ-SNAP does not bind SNAREs, one plausible possibility is that Gaf-1/Rip11 may provide a docking site for γ-SNAP as SNAREs do for α-SNAP. If this were the case, a complex comprising γ-SNAP and Gaf-1/Rip11 would be disassembled in a manner coupled to NSF-mediated ATP hydrolysis. Our present results clearly showed the requirement of NSF for the disassembly of the γ-SNAP-Gaf-1/Rip11. It is possible that γ-SNAP, in cooperation with NSF, may regulate the function of members of the Rab11-interacting protein family. We thank K. Mitsui and K. Okada for technical assistance and Dr. R.

https://openalex.org/W2001973941,"Autoantibodies to the recombinant extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (exEGFR) were detected by ELISA in the serum of Fas-defective old MRL/MpJ/lpr and C3H/HeJ/gld mice, but not young mice from these strains, or nonautoimmune young and old BALB/c, MRL/MpJ/++, and C3H/HeJ/MMTV mice. Compared with control human subjects without autoimmune disease, the frequency of exEGFR-binding autoantibodies was increased in scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) patients and to a lesser extent in lupus patients. Phage autoantibodies (Fv fragments) isolated from a lupus library by selection on a linear epitope of EGFR (residues 294-310) displayed the ability to bind exEGFR. Treatment of EGFR-expressing A431 cells with autoantibodies purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized exEGFR resulted in specific staining of the cells. Short-lived but strong inhibition of cellular DNA synthesis was observed in the presence of the autoantibodies. We concluded that autoantibody responses to EGFR hold the potential of fulfilling a pathogenic role in autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W1989910865,"Recombinant human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPAH) expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> for 24 h at 28 °C has been found by two-dimensional electrophoresis to exist as a mixture of four to five molecular forms as a result of nonenzymatic deamidation of labile Asn residues. The multiple deamidations alter the functional properties of the enzyme including its affinity for l-phenylalanine and tetrahydrobiopterin, catalytic efficiency, and substrate inhibition and also result in enzyme forms more susceptible to limited tryptic proteolysis. Asn<sup>32</sup> in the regulatory domain deamidates very rapidly because of its nearest neighbor amino acid Gly<sup>33</sup>(Solstad, T., Carvalho, R. N., Andersen, O. A., Waidelich, D., and Flatmark, T. (2003) <i>Eur. J. Biochem.</i>, in press). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight-mass spectrometry of the tryptic peptides in the catalytic domain of a 24-h (28 °C) expressed enzyme has shown Asn<sup>376</sup> and Asn<sup>133</sup> to be labile residues. Site-directed mutagenesis of nine Asn residues revealed that the deamidations of Asn<sup>32</sup> and Asn<sup>376</sup> are the main determinants for the functional and regulatory differences observed between the 2- and 24-h-induced wild-type (wt) enzyme. The Asn<sup>32</sup> → Asp, Asn<sup>376</sup> → Asp, and the double mutant forms expressed for 2 h at 28 °C revealed qualitatively similar regulatory properties as the highly deamidated 24-h expressed wt-hPAH. Moreover, deamidation of Asn<sup>32</sup> in the wt-hPAH (24 h expression at 28 °C) and the Asn<sup>32</sup> → Asp mutation both increase the initial rate of phosphorylation of Ser<sup>16</sup> by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (<i>p</i> < 0.005). By contrast, the substitution of Gly<sup>33</sup> with Ala or Val, both preventing the deamidation of Asn<sup>32</sup>, resulted in enzyme forms that were phosphorylated at a similar rate as nondeamidated wt-hPAH, even on 24-h expression. The other Asn → Asp substitutions (in the catalytic domain) revealed that Asn<sup>207</sup> and Asn<sup>223</sup> have an important stabilizing structural function. Finally, two recently reported phenylketonuria mutations at Asn residues in the catalytic domain were studied,<i>i.e.</i> Asn<sup>167</sup> → Ile and Asn<sup>207</sup> → Asp, and their phenotypes were characterized."

https://openalex.org/W2085502415,"Since quantal release was first described, it has been clear that release of neurotransmitters is a stochastic process. Modulation of neurotransmitter release probability by regulatory factors likely affects the transfer of information within the nervous system. Although many rules governing release probabilities at the synapse have been discovered, their molecular basis is still under investigation. Here we analyze stimulus-evoked probabilistic assembly of the SNARE fusion machinery and show that a simple SNARE-based mechanism can account quantitatively for the classical binomial behavior of stochastic neurotransmitter release. Our analysis highlights for the first time how the fusion machinery, which is directly responsible for neurotransmitter release, may also contribute to the rich variety of synaptic responses."
