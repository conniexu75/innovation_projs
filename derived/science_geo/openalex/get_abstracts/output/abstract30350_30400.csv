https://openalex.org/W2050143329,"Whereas case rates for some childhood diseases (chickenpox) often vary according to an almost regular annual cycle, the incidence of more efficiently transmitted infections such as measles is more variable. Three hypotheses have been proposed to account for such fluctuations. (i) Irregular dynamics result from random shocks to systems with stable equilibria. (ii) The intrinsic dynamics correspond to biennial cycles that are subject to stochastic forcing. (iii) Aperiodic fluctuations are intrinsic to the epidemiology. Comparison of real world data and epidemiological models suggests that measles epidemics are inherently chaotic. Conversely, the extent to which chickenpox outbreaks approximate a yearly cycle depends inversely on the population size."
https://openalex.org/W1975934006,"The factors responsible for the unusual susceptibility of the hippocampus to seizures and ischemic cell damage are not well understood. The CA1 pyramidal subfield of the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to seizure activity and damage after ischemia. The possibility was examined that regional differences exist in extracellular volume, which might influence neuronal excitability and response to injury in the hippocampus. CA1 stratum pyramidale exhibited an exceptionally low extracellular volume fraction (EVF) of 0.12, whereas the EVFs of CA3 and dentate were considerably higher--0.18 and 0.15, respectively. The EVF of CA1 stratum pyramidale was reversibly reduced by 30 percent when the extracellular potassium concentration was raised from 3.5 to 8.5 mM, a procedure that induced spontaneous electrographic seizures in CA1. Thus there are regional variations in the properties of the extracellular space in the hippocampus that might underlie the propensity of the CA1 region to develop seizures and to suffer damage after ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2025785035,"In the developing mammalian visual system, retinal fibers grow through the optic chiasm, where one population crosses to the opposite side of the brain and the other does not. Evidence from labeling growing retinal axons with the carbocyanine dye Dil in mouse embryos indicates that the two subpopulations diverge at a zone along the midline of the optic chiasm. At the border of this zone, crossed fibers grow directly across, whereas uncrossed fibers turn back, developing highly complex terminations with bifurcating and wide-ranging growth cones. When one eye is removed at early stages, uncrossed fibers from the remaining eye stall at the chiasm midline. These results suggest that crossed and uncrossed retinal fibers respond differently to cues along the midline of the chiasm and that the uncrossed fibers from one eye grow along crossed fibers from the other eye, both guidance mechanisms contributing to the establishment of the bilateral pattern of visual projections in mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W1641967096,"We report evidence for two foot protein isoforms in chicken pectoral muscle. (i) Two polypeptides with molecular masses of approximately 500 kDa copurify with [3H]ryanodine binding. (ii) Both polypeptides are associated with oligomeric proteins similar in size to the mammalian skeletal muscle foot protein. (iii) The polypeptides are shown to be unique by limited proteolysis. (iv) By using isoform-specific antibodies, the polypeptides are shown to be subunits of different [3H]ryanodine-binding proteins. Using immunolabeling techniques, we have localized these proteins in chicken breast muscle by both light and electron microscopy. (v) From immunofluorescent light microscopy of longitudinal sections, it was determined that both ryanodine-binding protein isoforms exhibit identical repetitive punctate distributions near the Z-lines. (vi) In serial cross-sections both proteins have similar distributions in the same fibers. (vii) Both proteins were found to be associated with the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum by immunoelectron microscopy. Based on their localization to the triadic junction, their large size and their ability to bind [3H]ryanodine, these proteins are identified as foot proteins. In conclusion, two distinct homo-oligomeric foot proteins coexist in avian fast twitch skeletal muscle. We have termed these proteins, alpha and beta foot proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2081732029,"Expression of T cell receptor (TCR) Vα genes in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within intraocular melanoma was studied. Primers for 18 different human TCR Vα families were used to analyze TCR Vα-Cα gene rearrangements in TIL in these melanomas obtained at surgery. A limited number of TCR Vα genes were expressed and rearranged in these tumors, and TILs expressing Vα7 were found in seven of eight of these uveal melanomas. TCR gene usage is also restricted in experimental autoimmune disease, in T cells within organs like skin and other epithelial tissues, and in the brain of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The restricted usage of TCR genes in TIL may indicate that a specific antigen in these melanomas is targeted."
https://openalex.org/W2166493323,"Dynamic remodeling of retinal ganglion cell terminal arbors has been proposed to contribute to formation of the topographically ordered retinotectal projection. To test this directly, the growth of individual terminal arbors was observed in live X. laevis tadpoles using a confocal microscope to visualize their complex three-dimensional structure. During initial development, nasal and temporal retinal arbors covered overlapping tectal areas. Despite subsequent remodeling, the dimensions and positions of the temporal arbors remained relatively stable. In contrast, the nasal arbors grew caudally, as they extended caudal branches and retracted rostral branches. These results suggest that differences in the remodeling of the nasal and temporal arbors lead to the emergence of retino-topography along the rostrocaudal axis of the tectum. All the terminal arbors were dynamic, including those with stable dimensions, suggesting that continual remodeling of arbors may be a universal feature of neuronal projections."
https://openalex.org/W2029475325,"The torso (tor) gene, one of six identified maternal genes essential for the development of the anterior and posterior terminal structures in the Drosophila embryo, is likely to function as a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. Although tor protein is uniformly distributed in the membrane of the egg cell and syncytial embryo, genetic and molecular data suggest that tor is locally activated at the ends of the embryo by a ligand present in the perivitelline space. Local activation of tor could be achieved if the ligand were expressed by a subpopulation of the follicle cells that surround the developing oocyte. Here we describe torso-like (tsl), the sixth member of the terminal gene class, and show that it is unique among these genes in that its expression is required in the somatic follicle cells rather than in the germ line. Moreover, mosaic analysis demonstrates that tsl expression is necessary only in subpopulations of follicle cells located at the poles of the oocyte. Thus, the spatially regulated expression of tsl in the follicle cell layer may generate a localized signal that is transduced by tor, ultimately resulting in the formation of the terminal structures of the embryo."
https://openalex.org/W1517896461,"Hirudin, a potent 65-residue polypeptide inhibitor of alpha-thrombin found in the saliva of the leech Hirudo medicinalis, and fragments thereof are potentially useful as antithrombotic agents. Hirugen, the synthetic N-acetylated COOH-terminal dodecapeptide (Ac-Asn-Gly-Asp-Phe-Glu-Glu-Ile-Pro-Glu-Glu-Tyr(SO3)-Leu) of hirudin was shown in the present study to behave as a pure competitive inhibitor (Ki = 0.54 microM) of human alpha-thrombin-catalyzed release of fibrinopeptide A from human fibrinogen. In contrast to this inhibitory activity, hirugen slightly enhanced (increased kcat/Km 1.6-fold) alpha-thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the fluorogenic tripeptide substrate N-p-Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. These observations indicate that hirugen binds to alpha-thrombin at an exosite distinct from the active site, and that interaction with this exosite is a major determinant of the competence of alpha-thrombin to bind fibrinogen. Consistent with this view, hirugen blocked binding of fibrin II to alpha-thrombin. Studies of the effect of hirugen on the rate of inactivation of alpha-thrombin by antithrombin III (AT), the major plasma inhibitor of alpha-thrombin, indicated that binding of hirugen to alpha-thrombin results in less than a 2.5-fold decrease in the rate of inactivation of alpha-thrombin by AT, both in the absence and presence of heparin. This behavior is distinct from that of active site-directed competitive inhibitors of alpha-thrombin which bind to alpha-thrombin and block both conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and inactivation of alpha-thrombin by AT. Hirugen, an exosite-directed competitive inhibitor, blocks the interaction of alpha-thrombin with fibrinogen while leaving alpha-thrombin competent to react with AT. Thus, unlike active site-directed competitive inhibitors, hirugen should act in concert with AT and heparin to reduce the amount of fibrinogen that is processed during the lifetime of alpha-thrombin in plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1604118064,"Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) were purified from rat brain and labeled either with the site-directed affinity label [3H]propylbenzilylcholine mustard (PrBCM) or with the sulfhydryl-specific label [3H]N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), using a protocol designed to give selective incorporation of the label into disulfide-bonded cysteines. m1 mAChRs were purified from CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the cloned receptor sequence and labeled with [3H]PrBCM. The labeled receptors were cleaved with the lysine-specific protease Lys-C and, after fractionation of the products, subcleaved with cyanogen bromide. Two major CNBr cleavage products were found with a molecular mass of approximately 3.9 and approximately 2.4 kDa, labeled either by [3H]PrBCM or [3H]NEM. The results obtained from CNBr cleavage of purified forebrain receptors were consistent with those obtained from the purified cloned m1 mAChR. Edman degradation was applied to the CNBr peptides. The results were compatible with the attachment of the [3H]PrBCM label to a conserved aspartic acid residue in transmembrane helix 3 of the mAChR (corresponding to Asp-105, m1 sequence) and of [3H]NEM to a conserved cysteine residue (corresponding to Cys-98, m1 sequence). These results support the hypothesis that the cysteine residue participates in a disulfide bond on the extracellular surface of the mAChRs and related G-protein-coupled receptors, while the aspartic acid residue is involved in binding the positively charged headgroup of muscarinic antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W1522028136,"Self- or concentration quenching of octadecylrhodamine B (C18-Rh) fluorescence increases linearly in egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles but exponentially in vesicles composed of egg PC:cholesterol, 1:1, as the probe concentration is raised to 10 mol%. Cholesterol-dependent enhancement of self-quenching also occurs when N-(lissamine-rhodamine-B-sulfonyl)dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine is substituted for C18-Rh and resembles that in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles below, as opposed to above, the phase transition. These effects are not due to changes in dimer:monomer absorbance. Stern-Volmer plots indicate a dependence of quenching on nonfluorescent dimers both in the presence and absence of cholesterol. Decreases in fluorescence lifetimes with increasing probe concentration parallel decreases in residual fluorescence of C18-Rh with increasing probe concentration in PC and PC + cholesterol membranes, respectively. Decreases in the steady-state polarization of C18-Rh fluorescence as its concentration is raised to 10 mol% indicate energy transfer with emission between probe molecules in PC and to a lesser extent in PC + cholesterol membranes. The calculated R0 for 50% efficiency of energy transfer from excited state probe to monomer was 55-58 A and to dimer was 27 A. Since lateral diffusion of C18-Rh is probably too slow to permit collisional quenching during the lifetime of the probe, even if C18-Rh were concentrated in a separate phase, C18-Rh self-quenching appears to be due mainly to energy transfer without emission to nonfluorescent dimers."
https://openalex.org/W1525796010,"Apolipoprotein J (apoJ), a unique 70-kDa component of high density lipoproteins in human plasma, consists of two disulfide-linked subunits designated apoJ alpha (34-36 kDa), and apoJ beta (36-39 kDa) which share pI values of 4.9-5.4 and which are recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 11. ApoJ and its subunits were purified to homogeneity from plasma by a combination of immunoaffinity chromatography, using mAb11 linked to Affi-Gel, and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. ApoJ alpha and apoJ beta are both glycoproteins. When deglycosylated, the molecular mass of apoJ alpha is 24 kDa and that of apoJ beta is 28 kDa, suggesting that approximately 30% of the mass of each subunit is carbohydrate. The amino acid compositions of apoJ alpha and apoJ beta are very similar; however, the sequences of the first 30-amino acid residues are distinct. A comparison of peptide maps suggests that apoJ alpha and apoJ beta are not identical but share limited regions of homology. This possibility is supported by immunochemical data. Five additional mAb specific for apoJ were characterized. One of the mAb, like mAb11, reacts with both apoJ alpha and apoJ beta; the others react with apoJ alpha only. All mAb, including those which recognize both apoJ alpha and apoJ beta and those which recognize apoJ alpha only, immunoprecipitate a approximately 50-kDa protein synthesized from a liver mRNA template translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. We propose that the apoJ alpha and apoJ beta subunits, which have limited homology, are derived by proteolytic cleavage of a common precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1986925729,"Soluble peptide factors have been implicated as the agents responsible for embryonic inductions in vertebrates. Here, a protein (PIF) secreted by a mouse macrophage cell line is shown to change the developmental fate of Xenopus embryonic cells. Exposure to PIF causes presumptive ectodermal explants to form anterior neural and mesodermal tissues, including brain and eye, instead of ciliated epidermis. In addition, the induced tissues are organized into a rudimentary embryonic axis. These results suggest that PIF or a closely related molecule is involved in inducing anterior structures and organizing the frog body plan."

https://openalex.org/W2026506773,"X-ray diffraction shows the structure of a synthetic protein model, formed from noncovalent self-association of a 12-residue peptide and of sulfate ions at low pH. This peptide is a fragment of a 16-residue polypeptide that was designed to form an amphiphilic alpha helix with a ridge of Leu residues along one helical face. By interdigitation of the leucines of four such helices, the design called for self-association into a four-alpha-helical bundle. The crystal structure (2.7 angstrom resolution; R factor = 0.215) reveals a structure more complex than the design, with both a tetramer and a hexamer. The alpha-helical tetramer with leucine interior has more oblique crossing angles than most four-alpha-helical bundles; the hexamer has a globular hydrophobic core of 12 leucine residues and three associated sulfate ions. Computational analysis suggests that the hexameric association is tighter than the tetrameric one. The consistency of the structure with the design is discussed, as well as the divergence."
https://openalex.org/W1562570116,"Abstract This study investigates effects of chronic low frequency stimulation (CLFS) on myosin heavy (MHC) and light chain (MLC) expression in fast-twitch muscles in hypothyroid, euthyroid, and hyperthyroid rats. The changes at both the mRNA and protein level indicated antagonistic effects of thyroid hormone and CLFS: under euthyroid conditions, CLFS mainly elicited a MHCIIb----MCHIId----MHCIIa transition. Whereas CLFS did not induce the slow MHCI in the euthyroid state, this isoform was present in the hypothyroid state and was further enhanced with CLFS indicating the suppressive effect of thyroid hormone to be stronger than the inductive influence of CLFS. Hyperthyroidism alone suppressed the expression MHCIIa and enhanced a MHCIId to MHCIIb transition. This shift to the faster MHC isoforms was only partially counteracted by CLFS. Thus, it appeared that thyroid hormone had a graded suppressive effect on the expression of MHC isoforms in the order MHCIId less than MHCIIa less than MHCI. Elevated neuromuscular activity partially counteracted these hormone effects. Changes in MLC mRNAs were consistent with those in the MHC pattern, i.e. increases or decreases in MHCIIb led to corresponding changes in the expression of MLC3f. A similar relationship existed for the slow MHCI and the slow MLC isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1592529576,"An investigation was conducted to assess the effects of various β-galactoside specific lectins on the growth of vascular cells in vitro. The plant lectins from peanut (Arachis hypogaea), mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), and coral tree (Erythrina corallodendron) were used in these studies with the ultimate purpose of comparing those findings with data derived with the lectin isolated from rat lung. Peanut lectin was added to confluent and subconfluent cultures of smooth muscle cells (SMC), pulmonary arterial (PEC), and aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) at concentrations of 2, 3.5, and 7.0 μg/ml. There was a dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation for both confluent and subconfluent SMC, with maximal stimulation noted between 3.5 and 7 μg/ml of peanut lectin. A dose-dependent stimulation of PEC proliferation was also found with maximal stimulation between 3.5 and 7.0 μg/ml. Peanut lectin did not stimulate BAEC to multiply. The stimulation of PEC and SMC by peanut lectin could be prevented by the addition of 50 mM lactose. Peanut and mushroom lectin stimulated the proliferation of sparse cultures of SMC in a dose-dependent fashion in both standard (10% fetal bovine serum, or FBS) or low (0.5% FBS) serum to about the same degree. Coral tree lectin did not have a significant stimulation of proliferation under either serum conditions. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the DNA of PEC was increased 30 and 150% by peanut lectin and lung galaptin, respectively, under standard serum conditions. However, under low serum conditions, both lectins increased incorporation by about the same extent (93 and 78% for peanut lectin and galaptin, respectively). Both lectins produced a 30% increase in DNA synthesis by SMC under standard serum conditions, and about a 200% increase under low serum conditions. These studies indicate that β-galactoside specific lectins such as lung galaptin have mitogenic activity toward vascular cells.— Sanford, G. L.; Harris-Hooker, S. Stimulation of vascular cell proliferation by β-galactoside specific lectins. FASEB J. 4: 2912-2918; 1990."
https://openalex.org/W1553768169,"The naturally occurring PiZ and Pi NullHong Kong variants of the human secretory protein alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) are retained within an early compartment of the secretory pathway. Intracellular degradation of these transport-impaired secretory proteins is initiated 30-45 min following their synthesis and translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Interestingly, the overall rate of degradation of the retained mutant protein is significantly accelerated when all subcellular compartments are buffered at pH 6. In contrast, degradation is virtually abolished when intravesicular compartments are buffered at pH 8. However, despite this pH sensitivity neither lysosomotrophic amines, leupeptin, or leucine methyl ester have an apparent effect on the intracellular removal of the PiZ variant. The inability of a variety of inhibitors of ER-to-Golgi protein trafficking to hinder the degradative process suggests that degradation of the PiZ variant occurs prior to its delivery to the Golgi complex. To biochemically map the subcellular site of the degradation of the retained mutant protein, a recombinant truncated PiZ variant containing the tetrapeptide KDEL at its carboxyl terminus (a signal for sorting luminal proteins from a post-ER compartment back to the ER) was expressed in cells. Attachment of this ER-recycling signal to the recombinant protein prevented its intracellular degradation. These findings indicate that degradation of the PiZ variant occurs following its export from the ER."
https://openalex.org/W152472878,"We have examined the function of the cytoplasmic domain of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIg-R) by producing two separate deletions in the cytoplasmic domain of the pIg-R, expressing the mutant receptors in polarized MDCK cells, and analyzing each for their effects on receptor and ligand traffic. Deletion of the C-terminal 30 amino acids (726-755) reduces the rate of internalization of receptor-bound ligand from the basolateral surface. However, this mutation has no effect on delivery of receptor from the Golgi to the basolateral surface or the post-endocytotic traffic of receptor and ligand. Mutation of a tyrosine at position 734 to serine produces a receptor with a similar phenotype. If residues 670-707 are deleted from the middle of the cytoplasmic domain, both basolateral delivery and internalization are unaffected. However, unlike wild type, after endocytosis from the basolateral surface, both receptor and ligand are largely degraded. We reported previously that deletion of the entire cytoplasmic domain prevents the basolateral delivery of newly synthesized receptor (Mostov, K.E., de Bruyn Kops, A., and Deitcher, D.L. (1986) Cell 47, 359-364). In contrast, the mutants reported here are delivered to the basolateral surface, suggesting that only residues 653-669 and/or 708-725 are necessary for basolateral delivery. Thus, different deletions in the cytoplasmic domain of the pIg-R can produce mutant receptors which alter different aspects of receptor traffic."
https://openalex.org/W1527731578,"Translocation of large presecretory proteins into the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum requires the ribonucleoparticles, signal recognition particle, and ribosome and is tightly coupled to ongoing protein synthesis. We have shown previously that small presecretory proteins can translocate post-translationally in a reaction that does not require these ribonucleoparticles. We now report that one large protein, a synthetic hybrid between preprocecropin A and dihydrofolate reductase, translocates both cotranslationally (with the aid of signal recognition particle and ribosome) and post-translationally (without the involvement of these ribonucleoparticles) during its in vitro synthesis in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes. The distinction between these two modes of translocation was made possible by adding methotrexate to the translocation reaction. Methotrexate can only form a tight complex with those preprocecropin A-dihydrofolate reductase hybrid chains that have completed their synthesis and folded, but in forming this tight complex, this drug prevents translocation of the dihydrofolate reductase domain across the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1979077813,"We used transient transfection in COS cells to compare the properties of mouse muscle acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) containing alpha, beta, delta, and either gamma or epsilon subunits. gamma- and epsilon-AChRs had identical association rates for binding 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin, and identical curves for inhibition of toxin binding by d-tubocurarine, but epsilon-AChRs had a significantly longer half-time of turnover in the membrane than gamma-AChRs. A myasthenic serum specific for the embryonic form of the AChR reduced toxin binding to gamma-, but not epsilon-AChRs. The gamma-AChRs had channel characteristics of embryonic AChRs, whereas the major class of epsilon-AChR channels had the characteristics of adult AChRs. Two minor channel classes with smaller conductances were also seen with epsilon-AChR. Thus, some, but not all, of the differences between AChRs at adult endplates and those in the extrasynaptic membrane can be explained by the difference in subunit composition of gamma- and epsilon-AChRs."
https://openalex.org/W1521637700,"We present here a detailed study of the effect of detergents on the three peptidase activities (hydrolysis of the LLVY, ARR, and LLE peptides) of the purified multicatalytic proteinase from rat liver. At Triton X-100 and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) concentrations of 0.1%, all three peptidase activities are inhibited. Lower concentrations of the two detergents (0.01%) do not affect the hydrolysis of the ARR peptide, whereas they behave differently on the hydrolysis of the LLVY and LLE peptides. Triton X-100 inhibits and SDS strongly activates LLVY peptide hydrolysis by decreasing and increasing Vmax, respectively. In the absence of detergents, the saturation curve for the LLE peptide can be analyzed as the result of two components, one showing cooperative (nH = 1.6) with higher affinity (S0.5 = 60 microM) and lower Vmax than a second, noncooperative component (Km = 320 microM). SDS (0.01%) activates LLE peptide hydrolysis by suppressing cooperativity, slightly increasing Vmax, and decreasing the half-saturation concentration (Km = 30 microM) of the enzyme. Triton X-100 (0.01%) also suppresses the cooperativity and decreases the half-saturation concentration (Km = 25 microM) for the LLE peptide; in contrast, it reduces Vmax by inhibition of the low affinity, high Vmax component observed in the absence of detergents. Based on these observations, it can be concluded that both detergents behave like allosteric activators of peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing activity and that the multicatalytic proteinase has at least three different classes of active sites: two independent noncooperative sites that catalyze the hydrolysis of trypsin and chymotrypsin-like substrates and one class for peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolysis having two components: one cooperative (two or more sites) and one noncooperative."
https://openalex.org/W2090187735,Comparison of the 2.4 angstrom resolution crystal structures of dimeric clam hemoglobin in the deoxygenated and carbon-monoxide liganded states shows how radically different the structural basis for cooperative oxygen binding is from that operative in mammalian hemoglobins. Heme groups are in direct communication across a novel subunit interface formed by the E and F helices. The conformational changes at this interface that accompany ligand binding are more dramatic at a tertiary level but more subtle at a quaternary level than those in mammalian hemoglobins. These findings suggest a cooperative mechanism that links ligation at one subunit with potentiation of affinity at the second subunit.
https://openalex.org/W1604360007,"Exposure of quiescent cultures of human gingival fibroblasts (HuGi) and porcine synovicocytes (PSF) to human recombinant interleukin 1 alpha or -beta (IL1 alpha and -beta) enhanced the rate of glycolysis as judged by increased lactate production. The cytokines also increased uptake of [3H]2-deoxyglucose (DG) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Stimulation of DG uptake was first evident 6-8 h following addition of IL1 and was maximal by 24-30 h. IL1 alpha and -beta were equipotent. Half-maximal stimulation occurred at approximately 1 pM IL1; maximal stimulation (2.5-4.5-fold in HuGi, 3-7-fold in PSF) was obtained with approximately 80 pM IL1. The dose-response curves for lactate production and DG uptake were similar. Increased DG uptake was blocked by specific antisera to IL1 and by inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis but not by indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin production. DG uptake was enhanced by IL1 in serum-starved cells in the presence of neutralizing anti-platelet-derived growth factor serum. The effect was therefore not secondary to prostaglandin or platelet-derived growth factor production. No increase in cell cycling was detected in IL1-treated cells under the experimental conditions. Kinetic analysis revealed that the Vmax for DG uptake was increased by IL1 (from 36 to 144 pmol/min/mg of cell protein), whereas the Km was unchanged. HuGi cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine following exposure to IL1. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using a specific antiserum raised against human erythrocyte glucose transporter. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/autoradiography of these immunoprecipitates revealed dose- and time-dependent increases in the net rate of glucose transporter synthesis which mirrored the changes in DG uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1498842336,"Polar ether lipids extracted from 15 methanogenic bacteria, representative of seven genera, were screened by nuclear magnetic resonance and thin layer chromatography for the presence of hydroxyl groups on the C20-phytanyl moieties. Major amounts of hydroxydiether core lipid were confirmed for Methanosaeta concilii and discovered in two Methanosarcina species, Methanococcus voltae, and tentatively in several Methanobacterium species. Signals at 1.24 and 1.8-1.9 ppm in 1H NMR spectra are characteristic of Methanosaeta concilii lipids hydroxylated on carbon-3 (sn-3 chain). Related signals, which were shifted slightly, appeared in spectra of the polar lipids extracted from both Methanosarcina species. Following mild hydrolysis to remove the polar head groups, only two chromatographically distinct core lipids were found in significant amounts in Methanosarcina barkeri (and Methanosarcina mazei) consisting of 43% 2,3-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol (C20,20-diether) and 57% C20,20-hydroxydiether. This latter core lipid differed from the hydroxydiether from M. concilii by hydroxylation, on carbon-3, of the phytanyl chain in ether linkage to the sn-2 carbon of glycerol. The structural assignment was based on identification of the novel hydroxydiether core and its methylation products by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectroscopy. The hydroxy core lipid degraded to various products during standard methanolic HCl and sulfuric acid procedures, including a methoxy derivative (methanolic HCl) and the 3-mono-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol."

https://openalex.org/W1637498491,"We here present a general method to detect alkylation damage in specific genomic regions. Cells are treated with nitrogen mustard or dimethyl sulfate; the DNA is extracted and restricted, and the parental DNA is separated. Strand breaks are created at sites of N-alkylpurines by neutral depurination followed by alkaline hydrolysis. The DNA is then separated on alkaline agarose gels and transferred, and gene fragments are detected after hybridization with specific probes. Using this approach, we have examined damage formation and repair in the active genes dihydrofolate reductase and adenosine phosphoribosyltransferase, in a fragment containing the inactive c-fos gene and in a nontranscribed region downstream from the dihydrofolate reductase gene in Chinese hamster ovary cells. We find variations in the formation of nitrogen mustard adducts in these different regions. Nitrogen mustard adducts are preferentially repaired from the active genes as compared to the inactive gene and the noncoding region. However, we find no preferential damage or repair in these regions of the N7-methylpurines after dimethyl sulfate damage. Thus, there are significant differences in the repair mechanisms for two alkylating agents; this may implicate that there are important differences in the structural alterations in chromatin invoked by these agents. As a comparison to the studies of adduct levels in specific genomic regions, we have examined the overall genome, average adduct formation, and repair by these agents in the hamster cells. We used alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation, and also a novel approach: quantitation of the DNA smears stained by ethidium bromide in the alkaline gels (used in the gene-selective repair analysis). Both these techniques gave similar data for adduct formation and repair; there was less initial damage formation and repair in the average genome than in specific genomic regions."
https://openalex.org/W1562186342,"The signal peptides of pre-aldehyde dehydrogenase (22-mer) and pre-ornithine transcarbamylase (27-mer) were chemically synthesized and their imports into rat liver mitochondria were studied. Both signal peptides were imported rapidly (within 2 min) in the absence of a membrane potential, exogenous ATP, or rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Signal peptides also were imported into mitochondria treated with a low concentration of trypsin which removed the outer membrane proteins. It was concluded that the chemically synthesized signal peptide could be imported differently than the precursor proteins. The imported signal peptide were found to be associated with both outer and inner membranes. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the import was unidirectional and that the signal peptides associated with inner membranes increased during the chase time. The signal peptides inhibited import of precursor proteins to different extents. Association of signal peptides with inner membrane near or at translocator sites might result in inhibition of precursor import."
https://openalex.org/W1648194376,"The bovine liver mitochondrial factor that promotes the binding of fMet-tRNA to mitochondrial ribosomes, initiation factor 2 (IF-2mt), has been identified in the postribosomal supernatant fraction of isolated liver mitochondria. This factor has been purified approximately 5,000-fold and present preparations are estimated to be about 10% pure. IF-2mt has an apparent molecular weight of about 140,000 as determined by gel filtration chromatography. IF-2mt is active in stimulating fMet-tRNA binding to Escherichia coli ribosomes but E. coli IF-2 is not active in promoting initiator tRNA binding to animal mitochondrial ribosomes. The IF-2mt-mediated binding of fMet-tRNAi(Met) to mitochondrial ribosomes is dependent on the presence of a message such as poly(A,U,G) and on GTP.

Complementary DNA synthesis was primed from heterogeneous nuclear (hn) RNA by oligonucleotides derived from conserved regions of human Alu repeats. At least 80% of these cloned sequences were of human origin, providing an enrichment of at least two orders of magnitude. Two clones, one containing a fragment of the primary transcript of the human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene at Xq26 and another recognizing a family of human genes mapping to two regions of Xq24-qter, were characterized. Additional hncDNA clones mapped to a variety of sites in the Xq24-qter region, demonstrating the isolation of many transcriptionally active loci. These clones provide probes for identification of genetic loci on the terminal region of the X chromosome long arm, which is the location of a number of inherited disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2131122219,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has an in vitro inhibitory effect on tumor cells which exhibit a high number of EGF receptors (EGFR). Studies were performed in order to delineate the effects of EGF on glucose metabolism of MDA-468 human breast cancer cells, which have a large number of EGFR. Glucose consumption and lactate production were found to be substantially increased in MDA-468 cells following EGF exposure, while no such effects were detected in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which have a very low number of EGFR. When glucose levels in the growth medium were increased, the toxicity of EGF was diminished. The energetic status of MDA-468 cells perfused with growth medium containing EGF was monitored by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and no signs of compromised metabolic state or viability were noted for up to 36 h. The rate of glucose transport and phosphorylation was quantitated by 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy, utilizing [6-13C]2-deoxyglucose, and a 97% increase was found in MDA-468 cells following EGF administration. The profound effects of EGF on glucose metabolism in cells with very high numbers of EGFR and the lack of toxicity in the perfused system may indicate that the growth-inhibitory effect is confined to the in vitro cultured cells."
https://openalex.org/W1547867368,"Cells of Streptococcus sanguis express a collagen-like immunodeterminant (class II antigen) on their cell walls that induces aggregation of platelets in plasma. These platelet aggregation-associated proteins (PAAPs) are recovered in cell-free preparations obtained from cells of S. sanguis after 5 min of sonic or limited trypsin treatment. Pretreatment of platelet-rich plasma with these soluble preparations selectively inhibits platelet aggregation in response to S. sanguis cells. A PAAP antigen was isolated and purified from minimal tryptic digests of S. sanguis cells using (i) immunoaffinity chromatography or (ii) gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. A monospecific rabbit antiserum was prepared against PAAP (from procedure ii) and used to verify identity with PAAP fragments in different preparations. Criteria of purity included single precipitins in immunoelectrophoresis and crossed immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western immunoblot, and COOH (Lys)- and NH2 (Pro)-terminal analyses. The 65-kDa (p65) antigen isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography had 50-fold greater specific inhibitory activity in S. sanguis-induced PRP aggregation than the original tryptic digest and about 1.4 times that recovered by sequential column chromatography. Amino acids of the p65 PAAP fragment constituted 89.5% of the total dry weight, with glycine, lysine, and glutamic acid predominant. Lesser amounts of proline were also noted. Monosaccharides, including glucose and galactose, comprised 4.0% of the total. A platelet interactive determinant of p65 was localized to a 23-kDa tryptic fragment after further trypsin treatment. Amino acids of this 23-kDa fragment constituted 99.8% of the total dry weight. In their native state on the cell wall of platelet-interactive strains of S. sanguis, platelet aggregation-associated proteins are probably assembled on fibrils as polyvalent agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1571640119,"In this report, we demonstrate the expression of the mammalian System A neutral amino acid transporter in Xenopus laevis oocytes following microinjection of mRNA from rat liver, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and human placenta. Stage 6 oocytes were injected with poly(A+) mRNA from one of these three sources and incubated for 24 h prior to assaying Na(+)-dependent 2-aminoisobutyric acid transport to monitor the increase in System A activity. The endogenous 2-aminoisobutyric acid uptake rates in oocytes were sufficiently slow so as to provide a low background value that was subtracted to obtain transport rates for the mammalian carrier alone. The degree of expression of the mammalian System A activity in Xenopus oocytes corresponded to the known transport rates in the tissue from which the mRNA was prepared. For example, hepatic mRNA from glucagon-treated rats produced greater System A activity than mRNA from control animals, and the mRNA from the CHO transport mutant cell line alar4-H3.9, which overproduces System A, resulted in higher transport rates than mRNA from the parental cell line (CHO-K1). Fractionation of total mRNA poly(A+) by nondenaturing agarose gel electrophoresis revealed transport activity associated with a 2.0-2.5-kilobase mRNA fraction common to each of the three tissues tested."
https://openalex.org/W1870325908,"Abstract In principle, protein thermostability depends on efficient interior packing of apolar residues and on avoidance of irreversible denaturation in the unfolded state. To study these effects, the single free cysteine in the highly stable enzyme bovine Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase was mutated to alanine (Cys6----Ala), and the recombinant protein was expressed in yeast, purified, characterized for reversible and irreversible denaturation, crystallized isomorphously to the wild-type enzyme, and used to determine the atomic structure. Removal of the chemically reactive thiol significantly decreased the rate of irreversible denaturation (as monitored by thermal inactivation at 70 degrees C), but the observed energetic cost (delta delta G of 0.7-1.3 kcal/mol as determined by differential scanning calorimetry) was much less than predicted from either the change in hydrophobicity or packing due to removal of the interior sulfur atom. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.1-A resolution using an area detector, and the atomic model for the mutant enzyme was determined by fitting to electron density difference maps, followed by reciprocal space refinement both with stereochemical restraints using PROLSQ and with molecular dynamics using X-PLOR. The refined 2.1-A resolution crystallographic structure suggests that small concerted and compensating shifts (less than 0.5 A) of the surrounding side chains and of the adjacent N- and C-terminal beta-strands significantly reduced the energetic cost of the interior mutation by improving packing and stereochemistry in the mutant enzyme. Taken together, these results differentiate between the effects of reversible and irreversible processes as they impact the design of thermostable proteins and suggest that relatively subtle concerted shifts can significantly reduce the energetic cost of evolutionary variation in internal residues of proteins with Greek key beta-barrel folds."
https://openalex.org/W1533221205,"The activities of several selected Na(+)-dependent amino acid transporters were identified in human liver plasma membrane vesicles by testing for Na(+)-dependent uptake of several naturally occurring neutral amino acids or their analogs. Alanine, 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid, and 2-aminoisobutyric acid were shown to be almost exclusively transported by the same carrier, system A. Kinetic analysis of 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid uptake by the human hepatic system A transporter revealed an apparent Km of 0.15 mM and a Vmax of 540 pmol.mg-1 protein.min-1. Human hepatic system A accepts a broad range of neutral amino acids including cysteine, glutamine, and histidine, which have been shown in other species to be transported mainly by disparate carriers. Inhibition analysis of Na(+)-dependent cysteine transport revealed that the portion of uptake not mediated by system A included at least two saturable carriers, system ASC and one other that has yet to be characterized. Most of the glutamine and histidine uptake was Na(+)-dependent, and the component not mediated by system A constituted system N. The largest portion of glycine transport was mediated through system A and the remainder by system ASC with no evidence for system Gly activity. Our examination of Na(+)-dependent amino acid transport documents the presence of several transport systems analogous to those described previously but with some notable differences in their functional activity. Most importantly, the results demonstrate that liver plasma membrane vesicles are a valuable resource for transport analysis of human tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1156015887,"To investigate the regulation mechanism of the uptake of iron and heme iron by the cells and intracellular utilization of iron, we examined the interaction between iron uptake from transferrin and hemopexin-mediated uptake of heme by human leukemic U937 cells or HeLa cells. U937 cells exhibited about 40,000 hemopexin receptors/cell with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1 nM. Heme bound in hemopexin was taken up by U937 cells or HeLa cells in a receptor-mediated manner. Treatment of both species of cells with hemopexin led to a rapid decrease in iron uptake from transferrin in a hemopexin dose-dependent manner, and the decrease seen in case of treatment with hemin was less than that seen with hemopexin. The decrease of iron uptake by hemopexin contributed to a decrease in cell surface transferrin receptors on hemopexin-treated cells. Immunoblot analysis of the transferrin receptors revealed that the cellular level of receptors in U937 cells did not vary during an 8-h incubation with hemopexin although the number of surface receptors as well as iron uptake decreased within the 2-h incubation. After 4 h of incubation of the cells with hemopexin, a decrease of the synthesis of the receptors occurred. Thus, the down-regulation of transferrin receptors by hemopexin can be attributed to at least two mechanisms. One is a rapid redistribution of the surface receptor into the interior of the cells, and the other is a decrease in the biosynthesis of the receptor. 59Fe from the internalized heme rapidly appeared in non-heme iron (ferritin) coincidently with the induction of heme oxygenase. The results suggest that iron released from heme down-regulates the expression of the transferrin receptors and iron uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1556121705,"The minimum primary structural requirement for a tripeptide to serve as a substrate for oligosaccharyl transferase is the sequence -Asn-X-Ser/Thr-. In the present study the activities of three structurally different tripeptides containing acceptor sequences for oligosaccharyl transferase were compared in three systems: Xenopus oocytes, in which they were introduced into the cytoplasm by microinjection, cultured mammalian cells, and isolated rat liver microsomes. In the last two systems, the peptides were added exogenously to the culture or to the incubation medium, respectively. On the basis of lectin column and paper chromatographic analysis it was established that the microinjected acceptor tripeptides were glycosylated in Xenopus oocytes. However, lectin column analysis and retention of sensitivity to endoglycosidase H revealed that none of the three glycopeptides was processed to complex oligosaccharide chains and none was subsequently secreted. Rather, over a 24-h period the glycopeptides were degraded. Chloroquine was found to block this degradation process, but even under these conditions, the glycopeptides were not secreted into the medium. In the isolated microsomes the glycosylation of the acceptor tripeptides was time-dependent and the tripeptide with an iodotyrosine residue in the X position was found to be a poor substrate. When added to cultured mammalian cells, all three of the tripeptides were taken up, glycosylated, and subsequently secreted. These results are discussed in the context of the wide differences in glycosylation of the three peptides and their lack of secretion after glycosylation in Xenopus oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1603985894,"A 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT3 receptor binding site has been purified from deoxycholate-solubilized NCB20 cell membranes. Purification (1,700-fold) was achieved in one step by affinity chromatography with L-685,603 immobilized on agarose. The 5-HT3 selective antagonist [3H]Q ICS 205-930 labeled a single population of receptors in the affinity-purified preparation with a Bmax of 3.1 +/- 0.9 nmol/mg protein and Kd of 0.40 +/- 0.05 nM (mean +/- S.E., n = 3). The rank order of potency for a series of competing compounds confirmed that [3H]Q ICS 205,930 was labeling a 5-HT3 receptor in the purified preparation, and the inhibition constants for all antagonists were unchanged after purification. The purified 5-HT3 binding site eluted from a Sepharose 6B gel filtration column in a similar manner to the crude solubilized preparation (Stokes radius of 4.9 nm, apparent molecular size 250,000). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the affinity-purified receptor showed two broad bands by silver staining, migrating with apparent molecular masses of 54,000 and 38,000. Gel filtration of the affinity purified material yielded a single peak labeled by [3H]Q ICS 205-930 with an apparent molecular size of 250,000, which was also composed of two bands of 54,000 and 38,000, consistent with these being the constituents of the 5-HT3 receptor."

Chem. 260, 5998-6005). Addition of an aerobic NADPH-regenerating system, phenol, and azide quantitatively converted oxidized enzyme to the third intermediate, a 4a-hydroxy-FAD species (Detmer, K.M., and Massey, V. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 11265-11272). This intermediate was isolated in the presence of azide and a wide variety of phenolic ligands. Decay rates were followed for the dehydration of 4a-hydroxy-FAD enzyme resulting in the original oxidized form. Deviation from the rate observed in the absence of phenolic ligands was presumed to be indicative of a binding interaction. Several phenols displayed further stabilization of the 4a-hydroxyflavin species. These ligands exhibited saturation kinetics with respect to the decay half-lives, consistent with a mechanistic model in which both free and bound 4a-hydroxy-FAD enzyme may be directly dehydrated to produce the oxidized species. The lack of stabilization by catechol, the natural product, suggests that product is released from the enzyme during turnover by the time that this intermediate is formed. A pH profile, generated for the decay rates in the absence and presence of phenolic ligand, suggests both acid and base catalysis by hydronium ion and hydroxide, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2298886619,"The effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on collagen accumulation by human embryonic lung fibroblasts was determined. PMA (10 nM) dramatically inhibited collagen formation in cultures that were unstimulated or stimulated with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Collagen accumulation was decreased by 50% in unstimulated cultures and by 80% in TGF-beta-treated cultures. This inhibition was associated with a marked decrease in steady-state levels for alpha 1(I) collagen mRNA and decreases in alpha 1(I) gene transcription as determined by nuclear run-off assays. The PMA-mediated decrease in alpha 1(I) collagen mRNA was not affected by the addition of cycloheximide or indomethacin. Prolonged treatment with PMA (100 nM) resulted in down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) activity to less than 3% of untreated cultures. When PKC activity was down-regulated, treatment with PMA did not block TGF-beta-stimulated collagen formation, and prostaglandin E2-induced inhibition of protein formation was still evident. These results suggests that PKC activity modulates the level of transcription of collagen genes and collagen accumulation in lung fibroblast cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1609405917,"The binding sites of TFID, a species-dependent transcription factor, on the mouse ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) have been analyzed by DNase I footprinting using partially purified TFID. The region -12 to -140 spanning over the upper half of the core promoter (-12 to -40) and an upstream sequence (-40 to -140) was protected. Human fraction D could not protect corresponding regions of mouse rDNA indicating that the protection was indeed caused by TFID. This was corroborated by a competition experiment using point mutants having different affinities to TFID. The analysis with deletion mutants of upstream sequence together with the competition data indicates that the binding of TFID to the core sequence is required for the binding of TFID or some co-purified proteins to the upstream sequence, while the presence of upstream sequence stabilizes the TFID binding to the core sequence. The pattern of protection of the upstream sequence suggests that at least a part of the upstream binding does not require a specific DNA sequence there but rather is caused by protein-protein interaction involving TFID bound with the core sequence. These protection patterns did not change with TFID highly purified by sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1492647117,"Interactions between complementary protein and carbohydrate structures on different genera of human oral bacteria have been implicated in the formation of dental plaque. The carbohydrate receptor on Streptococcus sanguis H1 (one of the primary colonizing species) that is specific for the adhesin on Capnocytophaga ochracea ATCC 33596 (a secondary colonizer) has been isolated from the streptococcal cell wall, purified, and structurally characterized. The hexasaccharide repeating unit of the polysaccharide was purified by reverse-phase, amino-bonded silica, and gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography. Earlier studies established that the repeating unit was a hexasaccharide composed of rhamnose, galactose, and glucose in the ration of 2:3:1, respectively. In the present study, determination of absolute configuration by gas chromatography of the trimethylsilyl (+)-2-butyl glycosides revealed that the rhamnose residues were of the L configuration while the hexoses were all D. 252Californium plasma desorption mass spectrometry of the native, the acetylated and the reduced and acetylated hexasaccharide determined that the molecular mass of the native hexasaccharide was 959, and that the 2 rhamnose residues were linked to each other at the nonreducing terminus of the linear molecule. Methylation analysis revealed the positions of the glycosidic linkages in the hexasaccharide and showed that a galactose residue was present at the reducing end. The structural characterization of the hexasaccharide was completed by one and two dimensional 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Complete 1H and 13C assignments for each glycosyl residue were established by two-dimensional (1H,1H) correlation spectroscopy, homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn, and (13C,1H) correlation experiments. The configurations of the glycosidic linkages were inferred from the chemical shifts and coupling constants of the anomeric 1H and 13C resonances. The sequence of the glycosyl residues was determined by a heteronuclear multiple bond correlation experiment. These data show that the structure of the hexasaccharide repeating unit derived from the cell wall polysaccharide of S. sanguis H1 is: alpha-L-Rhap-(1----2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1----3)-alpha-D-Galp- (1----3)-beta-D-Galp-(1----4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1----3)-alpha/beta-D-Gal."
https://openalex.org/W1586162668,"We utilized recombinant fibronectin polypeptides with cell-binding domain and heparin-binding domains (referred to as C-274 and H-271, respectively) and their fusion polypeptide (CH-271) to examine the role of sulfated polysaccharide heparin and/or the functional domains of fibronectin in modulating tumor cell behavior. Both C-274 and CH-271 polypeptides with cell-binding domains promoted the adhesion and migration of B16-BL6 melanoma cells, whereas H-271 did not. Heparin bound to the immobilized polypeptides with heparin-binding domain (H-271, CH-271, and a mixture of C-274 and H-271 or fibronectin) but did not affect the tumor cell adhesion to the substrates. At the same time, heparin or two monoclonal antibodies against the heparin-binding domain were able to inhibit the haptotactic migration to CH-271 or fibronectin, though not to C-274 or a mixture of C-274 and H-271. This suggests that although heparin did not affect tumor cell adhesion to the cell-binding domain near the heparin-binding domain in CH-271 or fibronectin, it did lead to a modulation of cell motility. It seems likely that the regulatory mechanism may depend on interaction between heparin-like molecules on the cell surface and the heparin-binding domain in fibronectin, rather than on simple steric hindrance or on the masking of the cell-binding domain caused by the binding of heparin to heparin-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1537240442,"Heat-shock avian reticulocytes exhibit enhanced synthesis of a greater than 450-kDa protein. Biochemical, immunochemical, and visual criteria were used to identify this protein as the iron storage protein ferritin. The 21-kDa ferritin subunits synthesized during heat shock are similar in size and pI to the subunits that are constitutively synthesized. The 2-6-fold heat shock-induced increase in ferritin synthesis appears to be regulated at the translational level as it is insensitive to actinomycin D. Northern and dot-blot hybridization analyses of cytoplasmic RNAs with avian H-ferritin cDNA fragments support the contention that the heat shock stimulation of ferritin synthesis is translationally regulated. These latter studies demonstrate that the heat shock-induced synthesis of ferritin does not involve a change in the amount of total cytoplasmic ferritin mRNAs, but rather appears to entail a translocation of cytoplasmic H-ferritin mRNAs from a polyribosome-free, translationally repressed state to a polyribosome-associated, translationally active state. These results suggest that thermally stressed avian reticulocytes have a critical and functional need for the synthesis of additional ferritin and that its enhanced synthesis, unlike the new and/or enhanced synthesis of the well-established avian heat shock proteins, is regulated wholly at the translational level."
https://openalex.org/W1888737235,"Lens proteins labeled with the -SH-specific reagents N-(1-pyrene)-maleimide (PM) and N-(1-pyrene)-iodo-acetamide (PIA) exhibited pyrene excimer fluorescence around 480 nm. Among the gamma-fractions, only gamma II showed excimer band at room temperature with both probes PM and PIA. As the temperature increased, PM-labeled gamma IIIA, gamma IIIB, and gamma IV also began to exhibit excimer around 55 degrees C, which did not disappear at a very high temperature (85 degrees C). With PIA, gamma IIIA and gamma IVA did not show excimer at any temperature. The beta-crystallins, on the other hand, revealed a very strong excimer/monomer intensity ratio at room temperature, which decreased with an increase in temperature. Life-time measurements indicated a difference in the micro-environments around the labeled -SH residues. The origin of the excimer band as well as temperature effects on this band have been explained on the basis of intra- and inter-molecular interaction among the Cys residues in the lens proteins. The temperature-dependent CD studies further indicated retention of thermodynamic stability of the crystallins after chemical modifications. Both PM and PIA could be used conveniently to probe -SH proximity, determine the ease and extent of disulfide formation, and monitor the dynamics of lens protein conformation, all of which are critically important with regard to cataract formation."
https://openalex.org/W1589742473,"The effect of a series of di- and trivalent cations on the locomotor response of human neutrophils to the chemotactic tripeptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) was investigated. Migration was assessed by the leading front method. The cations inhibited FMLP-stimulated chemotaxis in the rank order: Ni2+ approximately Co2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than Zn2+ greater than Mn2+ approximately La3+ greater than Cd2+ approximately Ba2+ much greater than Mg2+. Benzamil, which blocks Na+/Ca2+ exchange, did not alter chemotaxis by itself but prevented the suppressive effects of each of the polyvalent cations on motility. The ion selectivity sequence and the lack of activity of benzamil are strikingly different than for O(-2) generation, thereby implying different modes of action in the two functional expressions. The F-actin content of the cells was monitored by the fluorescence of rhodamine-phalloidin. Each of the cations displayed comparable efficacy in blocking the polymerization of actin in FMLP-activated cells. Likewise, benzamil exhibited a protective effect, completely overcoming the inhibitory action of the polyvalent cations. The results indicate that these foreign ions gain access to the cell interior via a benzamil-sensitive pathway, namely Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Upon entry into the cytosol, they then interfere with the formation of filaments from actin monomers. These studies help to shed light on the interaction of divalent cations with cytoskeletal and contractile elements in cell motility."

https://openalex.org/W1605435073,"We have reported previously that squalene is the major radiolabeled nonsaponifiable lipid product derived from [3H]acetate in short term incubations of frog retinas (Keller, R. K., Fliesler, S. J., and Nellis, S. W. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2250-2254). In the present study, we demonstrate that newly synthesized squalene is incorporated into rod outer segments under similar in vitro conditions. We show further that squalene is an endogenous constituent of frog rod outer segment membranes; its concentration is approximately 9.5 nmol/mumol of phospholipid or about 9% of the level of cholesterol. Pulse-chase experiments with radiolabeled precursors revealed no metabolism of outer segment squalene to sterols in up to 20 h of chase. Taken together with our previous absolute rate studies (Keller, R. K., Fliesler, S. J., and Nellis, S. W. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2250-2254), these results suggest that most, if not all, of the squalene synthesized by the frog retina is transported to rod outer segments. Synthesis of protein is not required for squalene transport since puromycin had no effect on squalene incorporation into outer segments. Conversely, inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis with mevinolin had no effect on the incorporation of opsin into the outer segment. These latter results support the conclusion that the de novo synthesis and subsequent intracellular trafficking of opsin and isoprenoid lipids destined for the outer segment occur via independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1652290957,"Bovine milk xanthine oxidase was potently inhibited by 6-(bromomethyl)-9H-purine in a time-dependent process with O2 as the electron acceptor. If the enzyme were assayed with phenazene ethosulfate as an electron acceptor, 6-(bromomethyl)-9H-purine was not an inhibitor. The rate of formation of inhibited enzyme increased with increasing concentrations of 6-(halomethyl)-9H-purine, decreased with increasing concentrations of O2, and increased in the presence of xanthine. The inhibited enzyme regained activity nonactinically at pH 7 with a t1/2 of 31 h. The optical difference spectrum between native enzyme and inhibited enzyme suggested that the enzyme-bound FAD was modified. This conclusion was confirmed by demonstrating that activity was restored to the inhibited enzyme if the enzyme-bound flavin was removed by treatment with CaCl2 and the resulting apoenzyme was reconstituted with FAD. Aerobically, 6-(bromomethyl)-9H-purine was oxidized by the enzyme to a species having a UV spectrum consistent with hydroxylation of the purine ring to form a urate analogue. Anaerobically, the enzyme reduced 6-(bromomethyl)-9H-purine to 6-methylpurine with 1 mol of enzyme being completely inhibited after reduction of 23 mol of 6-(bromomethyl)-9H-purine. Thus, 6-(bromomethyl)-9H-purine was not only oxidized by xanthine oxidase but was also reduced by the enzyme in a reaction that partitioned between formation of 6-methylpurine and inhibition of the enzyme by modification of the enzyme-bound flavin. Similar results were found when 6-(chloromethyl)-9H-purine was the inhibitor."
