https://openalex.org/W2048684839,"THE several reports of the presence of indole acetaldehyde in plants (reviewed by Larsen1), coupled with the recent isolation of indoleacetonitrile from cabbage2, suggest that numerous indole derivatives related to indole-acetic acid may be of natural occurrence. The importance of such substances as precursors or breakdown products of the natural auxin needs no elaboration. It was therefore thought worth while to make an extensive investigation of the indole derivatives occurring in plant materials."

https://openalex.org/W2047816692,"THE toxicity of aureomycin to guinea pigs, reported earlier by one of us1, has been further investigated, a part of the results having been published elsewhere2. Since it was found that aureomycin is far more toxic to guinea pigs when administered orally than by subcutaneous injection, it was concluded that this specific action of the drug must be primarily connected with the processes taking place in the digestive tract. Attention was therefore directed to the changes in the composition of the intestinal flora arising from the oral administration of aureomycin."

Recent discussions of this possibility3,4 prompt me to describe part of these investigations."

https://openalex.org/W1983100796,"A VARIETY of polysaccharides shows infection-promoting activity1â€“4. Nungester, Wolf and Jourdonais1 noted that a crude gastric mucin preparation greatly lowered the minimum lethal dose of bacteria when the mucin together with the bacteria was given intraperitoneally, although it did not lower the minimum lethal dose sensibly when the mucin and the bacteria were given intravenously. This observation appears to be the basis of a belief that the infection-promoting activity is conditional upon the injection of the polysaccharide into a serous cavity5. The question whether a peritoneal infection can be promoted by a polysaccharide injected into the blood stream does not appear to have been examined critically. Since a number of polysaccharides are of interest as plasma volume expanders, this question might have clinical implications."

https://openalex.org/W2026197041,THE thoracic gland has been shown in a number of insects to be the immediate source of the moulting hormone. It has been demonstrated recently that the neurosecretory cells of the brain activate the thoracic gland and thus bring about moulting.
