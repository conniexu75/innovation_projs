https://openalex.org/W2097117811,"The functional complexity of the human transcriptome is not yet fully elucidated. We report a high-throughput sequence of the human transcriptome from a human embryonic kidney and a B cell line. We used shotgun sequencing of transcripts to generate randomly distributed reads. Of these, 50% mapped to unique genomic locations, of which 80% corresponded to known exons. We found that 66% of the polyadenylated transcriptome mapped to known genes and 34% to nonannotated genomic regions. On the basis of known transcripts, RNA-Seq can detect 25% more genes than can microarrays. A global survey of messenger RNA splicing events identified 94,241 splice junctions (4096 of which were previously unidentified) and showed that exon skipping is the most prevalent form of alternative splicing."

This pattern can be replicated with a new data set of fossil occurrences representing 3.5 million specimens, but only when older analytical protocols are used. Moreover, analyses that employ sampling standardization and more robust counting methods show a modest rise in diversity with no clear trend after the mid-Cretaceous. Globally, locally, and at both high and low latitudes, diversity was less than twice as high in the Neogene as in the mid-Paleozoic. The ratio of global to local richness has changed little, and a latitudinal diversity gradient was present in the early Paleozoic."
https://openalex.org/W2057952798,"To find use in electronics, single-walled carbon nanotubes need to be efficiently separated by electronic type and aligned to ensure optimal and reproducible electronic properties. We report the fabrication of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) network field-effect transistors, deposited from solution, possessing controllable topology and an on/off ratio as high as 900,000. The spin-assisted alignment and density of the SWNTs are tuned by different surfaces that effectively vary the degree of interaction with surface functionalities in the device channel. This leads to a self-sorted SWNT network in which nanotube chirality separation and simultaneous control of density and alignment occur in one step during device fabrication. Micro-Raman experiments corroborate device results as a function of surface chemistry, indicating enrichment of the specific SWNT electronic type absorbed onto the modified dielectric."

We report the crystal structure of a member of the solute sodium symporters (SSS), the Vibrio parahaemolyticus sodium/galactose symporter (vSGLT). The ∼3.0 angstrom structure contains 14 transmembrane (TM) helices in an inward-facing conformation with a core structure of inverted repeats of 5 TM helices (TM2 to TM6 and TM7 to TM11). Galactose is bound in the center of the core, occluded from the outside solutions by hydrophobic residues. Surprisingly, the architecture of the core is similar to that of the leucine transporter (LeuT) from a different gene family. Modeling the outward-facing conformation based on the LeuT structure, in conjunction with biophysical data, provides insight into structural rearrangements for active transport."

https://openalex.org/W2032459218,"Ubiquitin chain complexity in cells is likely regulated by a diverse set of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) with distinct ubiquitin chain preferences. Here we show that the polyglutamine disease protein, ataxin-3, binds and cleaves ubiquitin chains in a manner suggesting that it functions as a mixed linkage, chain-editing enzyme. Ataxin-3 cleaves ubiquitin chains through its amino-terminal Josephin domain and binds ubiquitin chains through a carboxyl-terminal cluster of ubiquitin interaction motifs neighboring the pathogenic polyglutamine tract. Ataxin-3 binds both Lys(48)- or Lys(63)-linked chains yet preferentially cleaves Lys(63) linkages. Ataxin-3 shows even greater activity toward mixed linkage polyubiquitin, cleaving Lys(63) linkages in chains that contain both Lys(48) and Lys(63) linkages. The ubiquitin interaction motifs regulate the specificity of this activity by restricting what can be cleaved by the protease domain, demonstrating that linkage specificity can be determined by elements outside the catalytic domain of a DUB. These findings establish ataxin-3 as a novel DUB that edits topologically complex chains."
https://openalex.org/W2098014891,"Mind-body practices that elicit the relaxation response (RR) have been used worldwide for millennia to prevent and treat disease. The RR is characterized by decreased oxygen consumption, increased exhaled nitric oxide, and reduced psychological distress. It is believed to be the counterpart of the stress response that exhibits a distinct pattern of physiology and transcriptional profile. We hypothesized that RR elicitation results in characteristic gene expression changes that can be used to measure physiological responses elicited by the RR in an unbiased fashion.We assessed whole blood transcriptional profiles in 19 healthy, long-term practitioners of daily RR practice (group M), 19 healthy controls (group N(1)), and 20 N(1) individuals who completed 8 weeks of RR training (group N(2)). 2209 genes were differentially expressed in group M relative to group N(1) (p<0.05) and 1561 genes in group N(2) compared to group N(1) (p<0.05). Importantly, 433 (p<10(-10)) of 2209 and 1561 differentially expressed genes were shared among long-term (M) and short-term practitioners (N(2)). Gene ontology and gene set enrichment analyses revealed significant alterations in cellular metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, generation of reactive oxygen species and response to oxidative stress in long-term and short-term practitioners of daily RR practice that may counteract cellular damage related to chronic psychological stress. A significant number of genes and pathways were confirmed in an independent validation set containing 5 N(1) controls, 5 N(2) short-term and 6 M long-term practitioners.This study provides the first compelling evidence that the RR elicits specific gene expression changes in short-term and long-term practitioners. Our results suggest consistent and constitutive changes in gene expression resulting from RR may relate to long term physiological effects. Our study may stimulate new investigations into applying transcriptional profiling for accurately measuring RR and stress related responses in multiple disease settings."
https://openalex.org/W2017397770,"During its first flyby of Mercury, the MESSENGER spacecraft measured the planet's near-equatorial magnetic field. The field strength is consistent to within an estimated uncertainty of 10% with that observed near the equator by Mariner 10. Centered dipole solutions yield a southward planetary moment of 230 to 290 nanotesla RM3 (where RM is Mercury's mean radius) tilted between 5 degrees and 12 degrees from the rotation axis. Multipole solutions yield non-dipolar contributions of 22% to 52% of the dipole field magnitude. Magnetopause and tail currents account for part of the high-order field, and plasma pressure effects may explain the remainder, so that a pure centered dipole cannot be ruled out."
https://openalex.org/W2041551771,"Observations by MESSENGER show that Mercury's magnetosphere is immersed in a comet-like cloud of planetary ions. The most abundant, Na + , is broadly distributed but exhibits flux maxima in the magnetosheath, where the local plasma flow speed is high, and near the spacecraft's closest approach, where atmospheric density should peak. The magnetic field showed reconnection signatures in the form of flux transfer events, azimuthal rotations consistent with Kelvin-Helmholtz waves along the magnetopause, and extensive ultralow-frequency wave activity. Two outbound current sheet boundaries were observed, across which the magnetic field decreased in a manner suggestive of a double magnetopause. The separation of these current layers, comparable to the gyro-radius of a Na + pickup ion entering the magnetosphere after being accelerated in the magnetosheath, may indicate a planetary ion boundary layer."
https://openalex.org/W2090378085,"In January 2008, the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft became the first probe to fly past the planet Mercury in 33 years. The encounter revealed that Mercury is a dynamic system; its liquid iron-rich outer core is coupled through a dominantly dipolar magnetic field to the surface, exosphere, and magnetosphere, all of which interact with the solar wind. MESSENGER images confirm that lobate scarps are the dominant tectonic landform and record global contraction associated with cooling of the planet. The history of contraction can be related to the history of volcanism and cratering, and the total contractional strain is at least one-third greater than inferred from Mariner 10 images. On the basis of measurements of thermal neutrons made during the flyby, the average abundance of iron in Mercury's surface material is less than 6% by weight."
https://openalex.org/W2002300809,"The origin of plains on Mercury, whether by volcanic flooding or impact ejecta ponding, has been controversial since the Mariner 10 flybys (1974–75). High-resolution images (down to 150 meters per pixel) obtained during the first MESSENGER flyby show evidence for volcanic vents around the Caloris basin inner margin and demonstrate that plains were emplaced sequentially inside and adjacent to numerous large impact craters, to thicknesses in excess of several kilometers. Radial graben and a floor-fractured crater may indicate intrusive activity. These observations, coupled with additional evidence from color images and impact crater size-frequency distributions, support a volcanic origin for several regions of plains and substantiate the important role of volcanism in the geological history of Mercury."
https://openalex.org/W2081257201,"Background The options for medical use of signaling molecules as stimulators of tissue regeneration are currently limited. Preclinical evidence suggests that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 can promote periodontal regeneration. This study aimed to clarify the activity of FGF-2 in stimulating regeneration of periodontal tissue lost by periodontitis and to evaluate the safety of such stimulation. Methodology/Principal Findings We used recombinant human FGF-2 with 3% hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) as vehicle and conducted a randomized double-blinded controlled trial involving 13 facilities. Subjects comprised 74 patients displaying a 2- or 3-walled vertical bone defect as measured ≥3 mm apical to the bone crest. Patients were randomly assigned to 4 groups: Group P, given HPC with no FGF-2; Group L, given HPC containing 0.03% FGF-2; Group M, given HPC containing 0.1% FGF-2; and Group H, given HPC containing 0.3% FGF-2. Each patient underwent flap operation during which we administered 200 µL of the appropriate investigational drug to the bone defect. Before and for 36 weeks following administration, patients underwent periodontal tissue inspections and standardized radiography of the region under investigation. As a result, a significant difference (p = 0.021) in rate of increase in alveolar bone height was identified between Group P (23.92%) and Group H (58.62%) at 36 weeks. The linear increase in alveolar bone height at 36 weeks in Group P and H was 0.95 mm and 1.85 mm, respectively (p = 0.132). No serious adverse events attributable to the investigational drug were identified. Conclusions Although no statistically significant differences were noted for gains in clinical attachment level and alveolar bone gain for FGF-2 groups versus Group P, the significant difference in rate of increase in alveolar bone height (p = 0.021) between Groups P and H at 36 weeks suggests that some efficacy could be expected from FGF-2 in stimulating regeneration of periodontal tissue in patients with periodontitis.

https://openalex.org/W2045974918,"Multispectral images of Mercury obtained by the MESSENGER spacecraft reveal that its surface has an overall relatively low reflectance with three large-scale units identified on the basis of reflectance and slope (0.4 to 1.0 micrometer). A higher-reflectance, relatively red material occurs as a distinct class of smooth plains that were likely emplaced volcanically; a lower-reflectance material with a lesser spectral slope may represent a distinct crustal component enriched in opaque minerals, possibly more common at depth. A spectrally intermediate terrain probably forms most of the upper crust. Three other spectrally distinct but spatially restricted units include fresh crater ejecta less affected by space weathering than other surface materials; high-reflectance deposits seen in some crater floors; and moderately high-reflectance, relatively reddish material associated with rimless depressions."
https://openalex.org/W2034566787,"The double pulsar PSR J0737-3039A/B consists of two neutron stars in a highly relativistic orbit that displays a roughly 30-second eclipse when pulsar A passes behind pulsar B. Describing this eclipse of pulsar A as due to absorption occurring in the magnetosphere of pulsar B, we successfully used a simple geometric model to characterize the observed changing eclipse morphology and to measure the relativistic precession of pulsar B's spin axis around the total orbital angular momentum. This provides a test of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-field regime. Our measured relativistic spin precession rate of 4.77 degrees (-0 degrees .65)(+0 degrees .66) per year (68% confidence level) is consistent with that predicted by general relativity within an uncertainty of 13%."
https://openalex.org/W2068167623,"Species range expansion reduces genetic variation at the margins of a species range and should thus compromise the adaptive potential of its marginal populations. Remarkably, this prediction has not previously been tested. Here, we show that populations of the plant Mercurialis annua, which expanded its range into Spain and Portugal from North Africa after the Pleistocene glaciation, respond to selection on a key life-history trait less well than populations from the species' historical refugium. Our results provide direct evidence of a decline in adaptive potential across the geographic range of a species after a shift in its distribution. Predicting evolutionary responses to environmental change will thus need to account for the genetic heterogeneity of species and the spatial dynamics of their geographic distributions."
https://openalex.org/W2027392116,"Activation of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) transcription is established through the formation of protein complexes on the viral promoter that are essentially composed of the cellular basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB (or certain other members of the ATF/CREB family), the HTLV-1-encoded transactivator Tax, and the pleiotropic cellular coactivators p300/CBP. HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) is a protein encoded by HTLV-1 that contains a bZIP domain and functions to repress HTLV-1 transcription. HBZ has been shown to repress viral transcription by dimerizing with CREB, which occurs specifically through the bZIP domain in each protein, and preventing CREB from binding to the DNA. However, we previously found that HBZ causes only partial removal of CREB from a chromosomally integrated viral promoter, and more importantly, an HBZ mutant lacking the COOH-terminal bZIP domain retains the ability to repress viral transcription. These results suggest that an additional mechanism contributes to HBZ-mediated repression of HTLV-1 transcription. In this study, we show that HBZ binds directly to the p300 and CBP coactivators. Two LXXLL-like motifs located within the NH2-terminal region of HBZ are important for this interaction and specifically mediate binding to the KIX domain of p300/CBP. We provide evidence that this interaction interferes with the ability of Tax to bind p300/CBP and thereby inhibits the association of the coactivators with the viral promoter. Our findings demonstrate that HBZ utilizes a bipartite mechanism to repress viral transcription.

Following its integration, the provirus utilizes the cellular RNA polymerase II transcription machinery for replication of the viral genome and expression of viral genes. These processes are dependent on the viral transactivator Tax, which is essential for strong activation of HTLV-1 transcription. Tax alone lacks DNA binding activity and is therefore recruited to the viral promoter as part of a complex with the cellular transcription factor CREB or other members of the activating transcription factor/cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein (ATF/CREB) family (3Gachon F.

These proteins carry a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain that stimulates protein dimerization and subsequent DNA binding. Dimer formation is specifically mediated through the leucine zipper (ZIP) domain, whereas DNA binding involves the basic region of each binding partner directly contacting the DNA. The Tax-CREB complexes associate with three Tax-responsive elements called viral CREs (vCREs) within the viral promoter that encompasses the U3 region of the 5′-long terminal repeat of the provirus. Each vCRE contains a central sequence similar to that of a cellular CRE that is recognized by CREB and flanking GC-rich sequences that are directly contacted by Tax (7Kimzey A.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol.

These coactivators possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, which frequently imparts a stimulatory effect on transcription through acetylation of transcription factors as well as the core histone components of the chromatin (18Chan H.M.

In a similar fashion, these coactivators also serve as scaffolds for the integration of other transcriptional regulatory proteins into promoter-bound complexes. With respect to their central roles in transcription, p300 and CBP are often targeted by transforming viral proteins, such as the adenoviral E1A protein, the human papilloma virus E6 protein, the simian virus 40 large T antigen, and the HTLV-1 Tax protein (15Kwok R.P.

Differences among isoforms are limited to a few amino acid alterations at the NH2 terminus of each protein. Each HBZ isoform contains an NH2-terminal domain that can mediate transcriptional activation when the viral protein is artificially tethered to the DNA (28Gaudray G. Gachon F. Basbous J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12813-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), a central domain involved in its nuclear localization (35Hivin P. Frederic M. Arpin-Andre C. Basbous J. Gay B. Thebault S. Mesnard J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and a COOH-terminal bZIP domain (36Hivin P. Arpin-Andre C. Clerc I. Barbeau B. Mesnard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2761-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This latter domain carries a basic region with an amino acid sequence that is distinct from corresponding regions of other bZIP factors. Interestingly, HBZ was recently shown to localize to the hTERT promoter and stimulate transcription of this gene. However, it is reported to be associated with the promoter via a protein-protein interaction rather than direct DNA contacts (37Kuhlmann A.S. Villaudy J. Gazzolo L. Castellazzi M. Mesnard J.M. Duc Dodon M. Retrovirology. 2007; 4: 92Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Unlike Tax, HBZ functions to repress viral transcription. This effect may play a role in allowing infected T cells to escape the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response by maintaining low levels of viral protein production (1Barbeau B. Mesnard J.M. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 26: 283-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 38Mesnard J.M. Barbeau B. Devaux C. Blood. 2006; 108: 3979-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In support of this model, HBZ has been implicated in enhanced infectivity and persistence in HTLV-1-inoculated rabbits (27Arnold J. Yamamoto B. Li M. Phipps A.J. Younis I. Lairmore M.D. Green P.L. Blood. 2006; 107: 3976-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, we have shown that the ZIP domain of HBZ contributes to its repressive function by mediating heterodimerization with CREB, CREB-2, CREM, and ATF-1 (28Gaudray G. Gachon F. Basbous J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12813-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 29Lemasson I. Lewis M.R. Polakowski N. Hivin P. Cavanagh M.H. Thebault S. Barbeau B. Nyborg J.K. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 1543-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Since HBZ appears to lack the capacity to associate with the HTLV-1 promoter, formation of these heterodimers inhibits ATF/CREB factors from binding DNA and, consequently, prevents the recruitment of Tax to the vCREs. However, certain lines of evidence suggest that this mechanism does not fully account for the repressive effects of HBZ on HTLV-1 transcription. For example, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we found that HBZ causes only a partial reduction in the level of CREB associated with the HTLV-1 promoter while producing a more dramatic decrease in transcription from the promoter (29Lemasson I. Lewis M.R. Polakowski N. Hivin P. Cavanagh M.H. Thebault S. Barbeau B. Nyborg J.K. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 1543-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). More importantly, we have shown that an HBZ mutant lacking the bZIP domain retains the ability to repress HTLV-1 transcription (29Lemasson I. Lewis M.R. Polakowski N. Hivin P. Cavanagh M.H. Thebault S. Barbeau B. Nyborg J.K. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 1543-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).In this study, we provide evidence that an interaction between HBZ and p300/CBP contributes to the inhibitory effects of the viral protein on HTLV-1 transcription. We identified two LXXLL-like motifs in the NH2-terminal domain of HBZ that are involved in this interaction specifically through the KIX domain of the coactivator. In line with this observation, we provide evidence that HBZ disrupts the interaction between Tax and p300/CBP, thereby inhibiting the association of the coactivator with the viral promoter. In conclusion, this mechanism may supplement the negative effect of HBZ on the formation of the Tax-CREB complex on the viral promoter to achieve sufficient repression of transcription for the maintenance of a persistent infection.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression Vectors and Antibodies—The pBIND, pcDNA-HBZ-SP1-Myc, and pSG-Tax vectors were previously described (39Gachon F.

The PCR primers for the HTLV-1 promoter are 5′-ATCATAAGCTCAGACCTCCGGGAA-3′ and 5′-CCTGAGGACGGCTTGACAAACAT-3′. Standard curves were generated for this primer set using 10-fold serial dilutions of CHOK1-Luc input DNA (DNA purified from a fraction of the total chromatin prior to immunoprecipitation) from each ChIP assay and were included on each experimental plate. PCR efficiencies ranged from 75 to 86%, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.97 to 1.0. Quantitation was done by comparing threshold cycle values for coimmunoprecipitated DNA to the threshold cycle value for the input DNA in each ChIP experiment, as described previously (46Frank S.R.

The morphology and spatial distribution of basin materials themselves closely match lunar counterparts. Evidence for a volcanic origin of the basin's interior plains includes embayed craters on the basin floor and diffuse deposits surrounding rimless depressions interpreted to be of pyroclastic origin. Unlike lunar maria, the volcanic plains in Caloris are higher in albedo than surrounding basin materials and lack spectral evidence for ferrous iron-bearing silicates. Tectonic landforms, contractional wrinkle ridges and extensional troughs, have distributions and age relations different from their counterparts in and around lunar basins, indicating a different stress history."
https://openalex.org/W2045605578,"TRPM2 cation channels are widely expressed in the immune system and are thought to play a role in immune cell responses to oxidative stress. Patch clamp analyses suggest that TRPM2 channel activation can occur through a direct action of oxidants on TRPM2 channels or indirectly through the actions of a related group of adenine nucleotide 2nd messengers. However, the contribution of each gating mechanism to oxidative stress-induced TRPM2 activation in lymphocytes remains undefined. To better understand the molecular events leading to TRPM2 activation in lymphocytes, we analyzed oxidative stress-induced turnover of intracellular NAD, the metabolic precursor of adenine nucleotide 2nd messengers implicated in TRPM2 gating, and oxidative stress-induced TRPM2-mediated currents and Ca2+ transients in DT40 B cells. TRPM2-dependent Ca2+ entry did not influence the extent or time course of oxidative stress-induced turnover of NAD. Furthermore, expression of oxidative stress-activated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) was required for oxidative stress-induced NAD turnover, TRPM2 currents, and TRPM2-dependent Ca2+ transients; no oxidant-induced activation of TRPM2 channels could be detected in PARP-deficient cells. Together, our results suggest that during conditions of oxidative stress in lymphocytes, TRPM2 acts as a downstream effector of the PARP/poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase pathway through PARP-dependent formation of ADP-ribose."

There are increases in ions at a mass per charge ( m / q ) = 32 to 35, which we interpret to be S + and H 2 S + , with (S + + H 2 S + )/(Na + + Mg + ) = 0.67 ± 0.06, and from water-group ions around m / q = 18, at an abundance of 0.20 ± 0.03 relative to Na + plus Mg + . The fluxes of Na + , O + , and heavier ions are largest near the planet, but these Mercury-derived ions fill the magnetosphere. Doubly ionized ions originating from Mercury imply that electrons with energies less than 1 kiloelectron volt are substantially energized in Mercury's magnetosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2113782542,"Determination of the relevance of both demanding classical epidemiologic criteria for control selection and robust handling of population stratification (PS) represents a major challenge in the design and analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Empirical data from two GWAS in European Americans of the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) project were used to evaluate the impact of PS in studies with different control selection strategies. In each of the two original case-control studies nested in corresponding prospective cohorts, a minor confounding effect due to PS (inflation factor lambda of 1.025 and 1.005) was observed. In contrast, when the control groups were exchanged to mimic a cost-effective but theoretically less desirable control selection strategy, the confounding effects were larger (lambda of 1.090 and 1.062). A panel of 12,898 autosomal SNPs common to both the Illumina and Affymetrix commercial platforms and with low local background linkage disequilibrium (pair-wise r(2)<0.004) was selected to infer population substructure with principal component analysis. A novel permutation procedure was developed for the correction of PS that identified a smaller set of principal components and achieved a better control of type I error (to lambda of 1.032 and 1.006, respectively) than currently used methods. The overlap between sets of SNPs in the bottom 5% of p-values based on the new test and the test without PS correction was about 80%, with the majority of discordant SNPs having both ranks close to the threshold. Thus, for the CGEMS GWAS of prostate and breast cancer conducted in European Americans, PS does not appear to be a major problem in well-designed studies. A study using suboptimal controls can have acceptable type I error when an effective strategy for the correction of PS is employed."
https://openalex.org/W2029692105,"The dermis and the epidermis of normal human skin are functionally separated by a basement membrane but, together, form a stable structural continuum. Anchoring fibrils reinforce this connection by insertion into the basement membrane and by intercalation with banded collagen fibrils of the papillary dermis. Structural abnormalities in collagen VII, the major molecular constituent of anchoring fibrils, lead to a congenital skin fragility condition, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, associated with skin blistering. Here, we characterized the molecular basis of the interactions between anchoring fibrils and banded collagen fibrils. Suprastructural fragments of the dermo-epidermal junction zone were generated by mechanical disruption and by separation with magnetic Immunobeads. Anchoring fibrils were tightly attached to banded collagen fibrils. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that a von Willebrand factor A-like motif in collagen VII was essential for binding of anchoring fibrils to reconstituted collagen I fibrils. Since collagen I and VII molecules reportedly undergo only weak interactions, the attachment of anchoring fibrils to collagen fibrils depends on supramolecular organization of their constituents. This complex is stabilized in situ and resists dissociation by strong denaturants."
https://openalex.org/W2030871503,"Morphologies and size-frequency distributions of impact craters on Mercury imaged during MESSENGER's first flyby elucidate the planet's geological history. Plains interior to the Caloris basin displaying color and albedo contrasts have comparable crater densities and therefore similar ages. Smooth plains exterior to Caloris exhibit a crater density ∼40% less than on interior plains and are thus volcanic and not Caloris impact ejecta. The size distribution of smooth-plains craters matches that of lunar craters postdating the Late Heavy Bombardment, implying that the plains formed no earlier than 3.8 billion years ago (Ga). At diameters less than or equal to 8 to 10 kilometers, secondary impact craters on Mercury are more abundant than primaries; this transition diameter is much larger than that on the Moon or Mars. A low density of craters on the peak-ring basin Raditladi implies that it may be younger than 1 Ga."
https://openalex.org/W2170620821,"Immunoglobulin (Ig) A represents the predominant antibody isotype produced at the intestinal mucosa, where it plays an important role in limiting the penetration of commensal intestinal bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. We show in mice that Peyer's Patch-derived dendritic cells (PP-DC) exhibit a specialized phenotype allowing the promotion of IgA production by B2 cells. This phenotype included increased expression of the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (RALDH1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), B cell activating factor of the tumor necrosis family (BAFF), a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), and receptors for the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The ability of PP-DC to promote anti-CD40 dependent IgA was partially dependent on retinoic acid (RA) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, whilst BAFF and APRIL signaling were not required. Signals delivered by BAFF and APRIL were crucial for CD40 independent IgA production, although the contribution of B2 cells to this pathway was minimal. The unique ability of PP-DC to instruct naïve B cells to differentiate into IgA producing plasma cells was mainly imparted by the presence of intestinal commensal bacteria, and could be mimicked by the addition of LPS to the culture. These data indicate that exposure to pathogen-associated molecular patterns present on intestinal commensal bacteria condition DC to express a unique molecular footprint that in turn allows them to promote IgA production."
https://openalex.org/W2077905824,"Tau, an important microtubule associated protein, has been found to bind to DNA, and to be localized in the nuclei of both neurons and some non-neuronal cells. Here, using electrophoretic mobility shifting assay (EMSA) in the presence of DNA with different chain-lengths, we observed that tau protein favored binding to a 13 bp or a longer polynucleotide. The results from atomic force microscopy also showed that tau protein preferred a 13 bp polynucleotide to a 12 bp or shorter polynucleotide. In a competitive assay, a minor groove binder distamycin A was able to replace the bound tau from the DNA double helix, indicating that tau protein binds to the minor groove. Tau protein was able to protect the double-strand from digestion in the presence of DNase I that was bound to the minor groove. On the other hand, a major groove binder methyl green as a negative competitor exhibited little effect on the retardation of tau-DNA complex in EMSA. This further indicates the DNA minor groove as the binding site for tau protein. EMSA with truncated tau proteins showed that both the proline-rich domain (PRD) and the microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) contributed to the interaction with DNA; that is to say, both PRD and MTBD bound to the minor groove of DNA and bent the double-strand, as observed by electron microscopy. To investigate whether tau protein is able to prevent DNA from the impairment by hydroxyl free radical, the chemiluminescence emitted by the phen-Cu/H2O2/ascorbate was measured. The emission intensity of the luminescence was markedly decreased when tau protein was present, suggesting a significant protection of DNA from the damage in the presence of hydroxyl free radical."

An ultraviolet absorption (&lt;280 nanometers) suggests that the ferrous oxide (Fe 2+ ) content of silicates in average surface material is low (less than 2 to 3 weight percent). This result is supported by the lack of a detectable 1-micrometer Fe 2+ absorption band in high-spatial-resolution spectra of mature surface materials as well as immature crater ejecta, which suggests that the ferrous iron content may be low both on the surface and at depth. Differences in absorption features and slope among the spectra are evidence for variations in composition and regolith maturation of Mercury's surface."

Energetic processes connected to the solar wind and magnetospheric interaction with the planet likely played an important role in determining the distributions of exospheric species during the flyby."
https://openalex.org/W2088440542,"Central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease is the aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), the principle component of amyloid plaques. The cell fate determinant Numb is a phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB)-containing endocytic adapter protein that interacts with the carboxyl-terminal domain of APP. The physiological relevance of this interaction is unknown. Mammals produce four alternatively spliced variants of Numb that differ in the length of their PTB and proline-rich region. In the current study, we determined the influence of the four human Numb isoforms on the intracellular trafficking and processing of APP. Stable expression of Numb isoforms that differ in the PTB but not in the proline-rich region results in marked differences in the sorting of APP to the recycling and degradative pathways. Neural cells expressing Numb isoforms that lack the insert in the PTB (short PTB (SPTB)) exhibited marked accumulation of APP in Rab5A-labeled early endosomal and recycling compartments, whereas those expressing isoforms with the insertion in the PTB (long PTB (LPTB)) exhibited reduced amounts of cellular APP and its proteolytic derivatives relative to parental control cells. Neither the activities of theβ- and γ-secretases nor the expression of APP mRNA were significantly different in the stably transfected cells, suggesting that the differential effects of the Numb proteins on APP metabolism is likely to be secondary to altered APP trafficking. In addition, the expression of SPTB-Numb increases at the expense of LPTB-Numb in neuronal cultures subjected to stress, suggesting a role for Numb in stress-induced Aβ production. Taken together, these results suggest distinct roles for the human Numb isoforms in APP metabolism and may provide a novel potential link between altered Numb isoform expression and increased Aβ generation.

Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). The abnormal processing of APP to generate the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) leads to the extracellular neuritic plaques characteristic of Alzheimer disease (AD) (1Mattson M.P. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 2Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5156) Google Scholar, 3Gandy S. Caporaso G. Buxbaum J.

The rate of Aβ production is believed to be a key determinant of the onset and progression of AD. Although proteolytic processing of APP and characterization of the APP-cleaving enzymes (α-, β-, and γ-secretases) have revealed important targets for drug discovery, the regulation of APP trafficking is less well understood. Several recent findings support the idea that the intracellular transport and subcellular localization of APP are crucial determinants of APP processing and Aβ generation (4Selkoe D.J. Yamazaki T.

One pathway for Aβ generation involves the reinternalization of membrane-bound full-length APP (4Selkoe D.J. Yamazaki T. Citron M. Podlisny M.B. Koo E.H. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Endosomes have been shown to be intracellular compartments, where the sequential action of β- and γ-secretases generates amyloidogenic COOH-terminal fragments of APP (APP-CTFs) and Aβ (1Mattson M.P.

Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cleavage within the Aβ region of APP by α-secretase, which prevents the production of Aβ, occurs in a late compartment of the secretory pathway, such as the Golgi, or at the cell surface (7Carey R.M. Balcz B.A. Lopez-Coviella I. Slack B.E. BMC Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Deletion of the APP cytoplasmic tail or inhibition of endocytosis has been shown to reduce Aβ levels, suggesting that endocytosis is critical for Aβ generation (4Selkoe D.J. Yamazaki T. Citron M.

Understanding the mechanisms that regulate APP trafficking to distinct subcellular compartments with the different secretase activities is important for developing strategies to reduce abnormal processing and to prevent Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. amyloid precursor protein amyloid β-peptide Alzheimer disease COOH-terminal fragment of APP phosphotyrosine binding domain proline-rich region short PTB long PTB enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay trophic factor withdrawal phosphate-buffered saline N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine soluble APP analysis of variance transferrin receptor ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase dynamin. amyloid precursor protein amyloid β-peptide Alzheimer disease COOH-terminal fragment of APP phosphotyrosine binding domain proline-rich region short PTB long PTB enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay trophic factor withdrawal phosphate-buffered saline N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine soluble APP analysis of variance transferrin receptor ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase dynamin. Numb is an evolutionarily conserved protein identified by its ability to control cell fate in the nervous system of Drosophila (11Uemura T. Shepherd S. Ackerman L. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

Numb contains two protein-protein interaction domains, a phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) and a proline-rich region (PRR) that functions as an Src homology 3-binding domain (13Verdi J.M. Schmandt R. Bashirullah A. Jacob S. Salvino R. Craig C.G. Program A.E. Lipshitz H.D. McGlade C.J. Curr.

Although only one form of Numb has been identified in Drosophila, mammals produce four alternatively spliced variants of Numb that differ in the length of their PTB (lacking or containing an 11-amino acid insert) and PRR (lacking or containing a 48-amino acid insert) domains (13Verdi J.M.

All Numb proteins contain the NPF (asparagine-proline-phenylalanine) and DPF (aspartate-proline-phenylalanine) motifs that are critical for interaction with proteins containing the Eps15 homology domain and with the clathrin protein AP-2, respectively. Numb can associate with clathrin-coated pits, vesicles, and endosomes, suggesting that it functions as an endocytic adapter protein (15Santolini E. Puri C. Salcini A.E. Gagliani M.C. Pelicci P.G.

Cell. 2002; 3: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Numb plays a role in the internalization of receptors that are involved not only in cell fate decisions during central nervous system development (17Guo M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Neuron. 1996; 17: 27-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) but also in neuronal maturation, differentiation, and survival (18Huang E.J. Li H. Tang A.A. Wiggins A.K.

Notch is an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane receptor that specifies cell fate in a wide variety of tissues and organisms through local cell-cell interaction (20Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Numb regulates the endocytic and ubiquitin-dependent processing of Notch (21McGill M.A. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23196-23203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and consequently the cell fate decisions determined by Notch signaling (22Frise E. Knoblich J.A.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 21-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In maturing neurons, Numb binds to the neural adhesion protein L1 and integrin in axonal growth cones and promotes their recycling (24Nishimura T. Fukata Y. Kato K. Yamaguchi T. Matsuura Y. Kamiguchi H. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 25Nishimura T. Kaibuchi K. Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 15-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated an interaction between APP and Numb in mouse brain lysates and in cell culture (26Roncarati R. Sestan N. Scheinfeld M.H. Berechid B.E. Lopez P.A. Meucci O. McGlade J.C. Rakic P. D'Adamio L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7102-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Truncation and site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that Numb binds to the YENPTY motif within the intracellular domain of APP (26Roncarati R. Sestan N. Scheinfeld M.H. Berechid B.E. Lopez P.A. Meucci O. McGlade J.C. Rakic P. D'Adamio L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7102-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Several other APP binding partners that interact with this motif, including X11, Fe65, mDab, C-Abl, and JIP-1, have been demonstrated to affect endogenous APP localization and processing (27King G.D. Turner S.R. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Considering that Numb is an endocytic adapter protein, we determined whether expression of Numb influences the trafficking and processing of APP. Our results show that expression of Numb isoforms lacking the insert in the PTB (short PTB (SPTB)-Numb) caused the abnormal accumulation of cellular APP in the early endosomes and increased the levels of APP-CTFs. By contrast, expression of the Numb isoforms with the insert in PTB (long PTB (LPTB)-Numb) causes a significant reduction in the cellular content of APP and APP-CTFs. Interestingly, when cultured primary cortical neurons were subjected to trophic factor deprivation, the expression of the SPTB-Numb increased at the expense of LPTB-Numb, suggesting that pathophysiological conditions can alter Numb isoform expression in a manner that increases amyloidogenic processing of APP. Understanding the function of Numb in the trafficking of APP may provide insights into the regulation of APP processing in AD pathogenesis and lead to possible AD therapies.

Expression of exogenous dyn 1K44E was confirmed by immunoblotting. Cell Lines and Transfections—PC12, HEK293, and SH-SY5Y cells were cultured under standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere (32Chan S.L.

SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with a construct carrying the AD disease-linked double (“Swedish”) mutation K595N/M596L in APP were obtained from Dr. W. Araki (National Institute of Neuroscience, Tokyo, Japan). Treatments—Trophic factor withdrawal (TFW) was accomplished by washing the cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then maintaining them in Locke's buffer (29Chan S.L. Pedersen W.A.

To inhibit proteasomes and lysosomes, cells were treated with proteasomal inhibitors MG-132 (5 μmol/liter) and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (5 μmol/liter) or the lysosomal inhibitors chloroquine (100 μmol/liter) and NH4Cl (50 mmol/liter) for various time periods. Inhibitors were resuspended either in DMSO or PBS. Controls were treated either with equivalent volumes of DMSO for the proteasome inhibitors or with equivalent volumes of PBS for chloroquine stimulations. RNA Isolation and PCR—Total RNA from cells grown on 100-mm dishes was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and 2 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase and an oligo(dT) primer (32Chan S.L.

Quantitative real time PCR analyses of APP, Numb, and actin were performed using the following pairs of primers: rat APP, 5′-CCACTACCACAACTACCACTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTCTCTTTGGCTTTCTGGAA-3′ (reverse); rat β-actin, 5′-TGTGATGGACTCCGGTGACGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACAGCTTCTCTTTGATGTCACGC-3′ (reverse); Rab5A, 5′-AACAAGACCCAACGGGCCAAATAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATACACAACTATGGCGGCTTGTGC-3′ (reverse); PTB-Numb, 5′-GGAAGTTCTTCAAAGGCTTCTTTG-3′ (forward) and PTB-Numb 5′-TTCATCCACAACTCTGAGTCCATC-3′ (reverse). The Numb primers were designed to flank the alternatively spliced insert in the PTB of the rat Numb cDNA sequence (accession number NM_133287). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cells were harvested and lysed in buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The protein content of cell lysates was measured using BCA reagent (Pierce). Extracts containing 50 μg of protein were electrophoresed using Tris-HCl or 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) under reducing conditions and immunoblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). For immunodetection of blots, enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) was applied. The optical band densities were quantified using NIH Image Analysis software. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Following experimental treatments, cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature, permeabilized (or not) with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and incubated for 1 h in blocking solution (0.2% Triton X-100, 5% normal horse or goat serum in PBS) and then with primary antibody for 1 h in blocking solution at room temperature (32Chan S.L.

The cells were washed with PBS and finally incubated with 1 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) in blocking solution at room temperature for 1 h. When double labeling was required, cell preparations were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and rabbit Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:200). Immunostained cells were observed with the appropriate filters on a Leica confocal laser-scanning microscope; average pixel intensity per cell was determined using software supplied by the manufacturer. Appropriate controls, such as secondary antibody alone, indicated a lack of nonspecific staining. Measurements of sAPP Levels—For detection of sAPP, the media were collected from cultures of PC12 clones and centrifuged at 3,500 × g (10 min, 4 °C) to remove cell debris. The cleared supernatants were concentrated at least 20-fold by ultrafiltration. Cells were harvested, lysed, and prepared for protein determinations. Equal amounts of volumes of supernatants, standardized to lysate protein, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses. All conditioned medium values were normalized to total protein lysates. Aβ40/42 Sandwich ELISA—SH-SY5Y cells expressing the Swedish mutant APP were transfected with plasmids for the Numb variants or an empty pcDNA3 vector using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's specifications. Conditioned media from transfected cells were collected 48 h after transfection, and protein inhibitors and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) were added to prevent the degradation of Aβ. The concentration of Aβ40/42 in samples and standards was measured in duplicates using the β-amyloid 1–40 and 1–42 colorimetric ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (BIOSOURCE). Similar measurements of β-amyloid 1–40 were performed in PC12 cells subjected to TFW. Measurements of Secretase Activity—The activity of APP secretases was determined using commercially available secretase kits (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The method is based on the secretase-dependent cleavage of a secretase-specific peptide conjugated to the fluorescent reporter molecules EDANS and DABCYL, which results in the release of a fluorescent signal that can be detected using a fluorescence microplate reader (excitation at 355 nm/emission at 510 nm). The level of secretase enzymatic activity is proportional to the fluorimetric reaction. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Confluent 10-cm dishes of each of the PC12 clones were washed three times with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+ and 2 mm Mg2+ and incubated with 1 ml of biotin label (Pierce EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin) at 2 mg/ml for 0.5 h on ice in the dark on a rotary mixer. The reaction was stopped by extensive washing with PBS and quenched with 50 mm glycine in PBS. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with streptavidin-coated agarose. The precipitated biotinylated proteins were subjected to immunoblotting to analyze the content of APP and transferrin receptor. Statistical Analyses—Statistical comparisons were made by using Student's t test and ANOVA with Scheffe post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons. Expression of Numb Proteins Alters APP Metabolism in a Manner Dependent upon the PTB—To investigate the impact of Numb on APP metabolism, we stably overexpressed each of the four human Numb proteins in PC12 cells (28Pedersen W.A.

Med. 2002; 1: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). APP is physiologically processed by α-secretase or β-secretase, resulting in the shedding of nearly the entire ectodomain to yield large soluble APP derivatives (called sAPPα and sAPPβ, respectively) and generation of membrane-tethered APP-CTFs that include C83 and C99. The C99 is further cleaved by γ-secretase to release the ∼4-kDa Aβ peptide and the APP intracellular domain. Stable expression of the SPTB-Numb proteins resulted in a significant accumulation of intracellular APP (Fig. 1A) and increased secretion of sAPPα and sAPPβ in the conditioned media (Fig. 1B). By densitometric scanning of Western blots, the total amount of APP holoprotein in cells overexpressing the SPTB-Numb proteins was increased by 4–5-fold compared with parental control cells and by 8–10-fold compared with the LPTB-Numb clones. The intracellular accumulation of APP holoprotein coincided with a significant increase in the amount of APP processing products. Both total sAPP and the amount of sAPPα immunoprecipitated from the conditioned media with anti-APP antibodies 22C11 and 6E10, respectively, were significantly higher in the SPTB-Numb clones. Steady-state levels of the α-secretase- and β-secretase-derived APP-CTFs, C83 and C99, respectively, were also increased in lysates, consistent with the ability of the SPTB-Numb proteins to promote nonamyloidogenic and amyloidogenic processing pathways (Fig. 1B). The opposite effect was observed in the clones expressing LPTB-Numb; steady state levels of APP holoprotein and APP processing products were markedly reduced relative to the parental clones. Only with long exposure times could the sAPP and APP-CTFs in the LPTB-Numb clones be detected. In contrast to APP, no change in the total levels"
https://openalex.org/W2155414220,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short 20–22 nucleotide RNA molecules that act as negative regulators of gene expression via translational repression: they have been shown to play a role in development, proliferation, stress response, and apoptosis. The transcriptional regulator LRF (Leukemia/lymphoma Related Factor) has been shown to prevent p19ARF transcription and consequently to inhibit senescence in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). Here we report, for the first time, that LRF is post-transcriptionally regulated by miR-20a. Using a gene reporter assay, direct interaction of miR-20a with the LRF 3′UTR is demonstrated. To validate the interaction miR-20a/3′UTR LRF miR-20a was over-expressed, either by transient transfection or retroviral infection, in wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts and in LRF-null MEF derived from LRF knock-out mice. We observed LRF decrease, p19ARF increase, inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of senescence. The comparison of miR-20a activity in wt and LRF-null MEF indicates that LRF is the main mediator of the miR-20a-induced senescence and that other targets are cooperating. As LRF down-regulation/p19ARF induction is always accompanied by E2F1 down-regulation and increase of p16, we propose that all these events act in synergy to accomplish miR-20a-induced senescence in MEF. Senescence has been recently revaluated as a tumor suppressor mechanism, alternative to apoptosis; from this point of view the discovery of new physiological “senescence inducer” appears to be promising as this molecule could be used as anticancer drug."

We demonstrate that a combination of ABT-737 and TRAIL induced significant cell death in multiple cancer types, including renal, prostate, and lung cancers, although each agent individually had little activity in these tumor cells. All of these cell lines expressed the Mcl-1 protein that is known to block the activity of ABT-737 and TRAIL but did not block the synergy between these agents. However, Bax-deficient cell lines, including DU145 and HCT116 cells and those cell lines expressing low levels of TRAIL receptor, were resistant to apoptosis induced by these agents. To understand how ABT-737 functions to markedly increase TRAIL sensitivity, the levels of specific death-inducing signaling complex components were evaluated. Treatment with ABT-737 did not change the levels of c-FLIP, FADD, and caspase-8 but up-regulated the levels of the TRAIL receptor DR5. DR5 up-regulation induced by ABT-737 treatment occurred through a transcriptional mechanism, and mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the NF-κB site found in the DR5 promoter was essential for the ability of ABT-737 to increase the levels of this mRNA. Using luciferase reporter plasmids, ABT-737 was shown to stimulate NF-κB activity.

Given the role of the Bcl-2 family members in inhibiting TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we combined ABT-737 and TRAIL to examine their ability to synergize in multiple tumor types, including lung, prostate, and renal cancers. We find that these compounds are highly synergistic even in the face of elevated levels of Mcl-1. Solid tumor cell lines that are resistant to combination therapy prove to have low levels of either Bax protein or the TRAIL receptor DR5. In resistant cell lines, ABT-737 treatment up-regulates the levels of the TRAIL receptor, DR5, through a transcriptional mechanism based on activation of NF-κB. Therefore, our study demonstrates that ABT-737 through modulation of the intrinsic pathway can markedly enhance the apoptotic activity of the extrinsic pathway activated by TRAIL.

TRAIL-induced DISC was immunoprecipitated and subjected to Western blot analysis according to a previously reported protocol (35Song J.H. Tse M.C. Bellail A. Phuphanich S. Khuri F. Kneteman N.M. Hao C. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6946-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To examine protein expression, the cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 2 mmol/liter EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with the antibodies as indicated overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the anti-mouse IgG2b-HRP, anti-mouse IgG-HRP, or anti-rabbit IgG-HRP. The blots were again washed and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare). Silencing of Gene Expression with Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) and Gene Transfection—Gene silencing was achieved by transfecting cells with siRNA duplexes using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions and siRNAs duplexes targeting human DR5 (5′-AACTACCAGAAAGGTATACCT-3′), Mcl-1 (5′-AAAAGTATCACAGACGTTCTC-3′), Bcl-2 (5′-AACCGGGAGATAGTGATGAAG-3′), Bcl-xl (5′-TAGGGTGGCCCTTGCAGTTCA-3′), Bax (5′-AACATGGAGCTGCAGAGGATGA-3′) or siRNA duplexes targeting human Bak 5′-AAGCGAAGTCTTTGCCTTCTC-3′. Scrambled sequence of nonsilencing control siRNA oligonucleotides, which does not match any human genome sequence, that target the sequence 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′ were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Gene transfection of human FLAG-tagged Bax cDNA in pcDNA3 were described previously (37Lilly M. Sandholm J. Cooper J.J. Koskinen P.J. Kraft A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4022-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The pRC/CMV-Bak vector was identical to one described previously (38Eguchi H. Suga K. Saji H. Toi M. Nakachi K. Hayashi S.I. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Luciferase Activity Assay—Luciferase activities were measured with the dual-luciferase assay kits (Promega, Madison, WI). To examine the effects of ABT-737 on DR5 promoter activity, 6 × 105 cells were cotransfected with 4 μg of pGVB2-DR5 reporter plasmids (a gift of Dr. Toshyuki Sakai) (39Yoshida T. Shiraishi T. Nakata S. Horinaka M. Wakada M. Mizutani Y. Miki T. Sakai T. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5662-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and as an internal control 0.01 μg of pEF-Renilla-luc using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Twenty hours later, cells were treated with ABT-737. Luciferase activities were determined by normalization of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activity. The reporter constructs containing a 552-bp 5′-flanking region of the DR5 gene with a wild-type or mutated CHOP-binding site, NF-κB-binding site, or Elk-binding site were generously provided by Dr. H. G. Wang (University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, FL) (40Yamaguchi H. Wang H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45495-45502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The pNF-κB-luc (4 μg) plasmids and control vector plasmid were a gift of Drs. Kurtz and Nieminen (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). Quantitative Real Time-PCR—For quantitative real time-PCR, total RNA isolated from the cells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) and Superscript II RT (Invitrogen), and the resulting cDNA was used for PCR amplification using gene-specific primer pairs. PCR conditions for these reactions were as follows: 95 °C, 10 s; 58 °C, 30 s; 72 °C 10 s for 40 cycles. A Bio-Rad iQ5 multicolor PCR detection system and iQ5 optical system software analysis were used for quantifying gene expression (Bio-Rad, version 2.0). The expression level of DR5 was normalized to GAPDH. The primers used for real time PCR were as follows: DR5 forward ATCACCCAACAAGACCTAGC and reverse TTCTGAGATATGGTGTCCAGG; GAPDH forward CAGCCTCAAGATCATCAGCA and reverse GTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTGAT. Synergy of TRAIL and ABT-737 to Induce Apoptosis—Adding TRAIL or ABT-737 alone to PV10 and KRC/Y renal cancer cells failed to induce cell death, but combinations of ABT-737 and TRAIL resulted in rapid apoptotic death beginning within 3 h (Fig. 1, A and B). A dose-response analysis showed increasing ABT-737-sensitized TRAIL-resistant renal carcinoma PV10 and KRC/Y cells to TRAIL (Fig. 1A). The cell death was easily visualized by phase-contrast microscopy (Fig. 1B). The dose-dependent induction of cleavage of caspase-8, -9, and -3 and PARP in both renal cancer cell lines PV10 and KRC/Y (Fig. 1, C and D) demonstrates that cell death was driven by both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. The synergistic ability to induce cell death is not limited to these two renal cancer cell lines but is found in multiple kidney cancer cell lines, A498, ACHN, and prostate cancer cell lines PC3R and LNCaP (Fig. 2A) and is correlated with cleavage of caspase-8, -9, -3, and Bid (Fig. 2B). The slight differences in the extent of caspase cleavage between Fig. 1 and Fig. 2B are a result of the 3-versus 24-h incubation with TRAIL and ABT-737, as well as the increased overexposure of Fig. 2A to demonstrate all caspase cleavage products. The differences caused by different lengths of incubation are highlighted for a single cell line, A498 cells, in supplemental Fig. S1A and S1B. This loss of cell viability occurs with an increase in apoptosis in 12 different renal, prostate, and lung cancer cell lines (Fig. 2C). A number of cell lines were found to be resistant to combination treatment, including DU145 prostate cancer cells, 786-O renal cancer cells, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, and normal renal epithelial cell line HK-2 cells. All of the cell lines that were sensitive to the combination treatment demonstrated increased cleavage of caspase-8, Bid, caspase-9, and caspase-3, whereas resistant cell lines, including HK-2 and HEK293, did not demonstrate these changes.FIGURE 2ABT-737 enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in renal, prostate, and lung cancer cells but not in normal kidney cells. A, renal cancer (A498, ACHN, and 786-0), prostate cancer (PC3R and LNCaP), and human embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK293) were treated with DMSO, 100 ng/ml TRAIL, 10 μm ABT-737, or a combination of the two agents for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by an acid phosphatase assay (mean ± S.D., n = 4). B, cleavage of caspase (Casp)-8, -9, and -3 and Bid was examined on the Western blots. Arrows denote procaspase-8 (p55 and p53), first cleavage fragments (p47 and p43), and the active p18 form of caspase-8; procaspase-9 (p47) processed to produce the active p37 and p35 forms; procaspase-3 (p32) processed to produce active p21 and p17 products; and full-length Bid (p22) and p15 truncated Bid. C, percentages of cell death in response to ABT-737, TRAIL, and ABT-737 plus TRAILs were assessed by the trypan blue exclusion assay. Each cell line was treated with either DMSO, 100 ng/ml TRAIL, 10 μm ABT-737, or the combination for 24 h (mean ± S.D., n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Regulation of Tumor Cell Sensitivity to Combined or Single Agent Treatment—To explore to the reason for differences in drug sensitivity between these cell lines, we examined the expression of components of the apoptotic cascade by Western blotting, including DISC proteins and Bcl-2 family members (Fig. 3A). Both the renal cancer cell line 786-O and the normal renal epithelial cells HK-2 display significantly lower levels of the TRAIL receptor DR5 expression than other cell lines. Because the other TRAIL receptor DR4 is not expressed in these cell lines or the majority of cell lines examined, an inability to bind TRAIL to the DR5 receptor could make these cells resistant to the combination therapy. Western blot analysis demonstrated that DU145 and a subset of colon cancer HCT116 cells (Fig. 3A), which did not contain Bax protein, were resistant to combination therapy. In comparison, the parental HCT116 cells that contained Bax were sensitive to the combination therapy (supplemental Fig. S2A and S2B). Bax has been shown to be essential for TRAIL killing (41LeBlanc H. Lawrence D. Varfolomeev E. Totpal K. Morlan J. Schow P. Fong S. Schwall R. Sinicropi D. Ashkenazi A. Nat.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), and the addition of ABT-737 does not overcome this blockade. ABT-737 occupies a hydrophobic pocket at one end of the BH3 binding groove that interferes with Bcl-2 family protein-protein interactions (25Oltersdorf T. Elmore S.W. Shoemaker A.R. Armstrong R.C.

https://openalex.org/W2111806456,"The spike activity of cells in some cortical areas has been found to be correlated with reaction times and behavioral responses during two-choice decision tasks. These experimental findings have motivated the study of biologically plausible winner-take-all network models, in which strong recurrent excitation and feedback inhibition allow the network to form a categorical choice upon stimulation. Choice formation corresponds in these models to the transition from the spontaneous state of the network to a state where neurons selective for one of the choices fire at a high rate and inhibit the activity of the other neurons. This transition has been traditionally induced by an increase in the external input that destabilizes the spontaneous state of the network and forces its relaxation to a decision state. Here we explore a different mechanism by which the system can undergo such transitions while keeping the spontaneous state stable, based on an escape induced by finite-size noise from the spontaneous state. This decision mechanism naturally arises for low stimulus strengths and leads to exponentially distributed decision times when the amount of noise in the system is small. Furthermore, we show using numerical simulations that mean decision times follow in this regime an exponential dependence on the amplitude of noise. The escape mechanism provides thus a dynamical basis for the wide range and variability of decision times observed experimentally."

However, because of appropriate immune responses and antibiotic therapy, overt mycobacterial diseases occur far less frequently. M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) causes Johne's disease in ruminants, an affliction evocative of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Several agents used to treat IBD (5-ASA, methotrexate, azathioprine and its metabolite 6-MP) have recently been shown to be antiMAP antibiotics. We herein evaluate the prevalence of MAP DNA in healthy individuals and compare them with IBD patients on antiMAP antibiotics.We studied 100 healthy individuals (90 blood donors) and 246 patients with IBD. IS900 MAP DNA was identified using a nested primer PCR in the buffy coat of blood. Positive signal was confirmed as MAP by DNA sequence analysis. PCR positive results frequencies were compared according to medications used. Significance was accepted at p<0.05.47% (47/100) healthy controls and 16% (40/246) IBD patients were IS900 positive (p<0.0001). MAP DNA was identified in 17% of 143 patients receiving mesalamine and 6% of 16 receiving sulfasalazine. None of the IBD patients receiving methotrexate (n = 9), 6-MP (n = 3), ciprofloxacin (n = 5) or Tacrolimus (n = 3) had MAP DNA detectable in their blood.We found a disquietingly large percentage of healthy individuals have MAP DNA in their blood, the significance of which remains to be determined. Counter-intuitively, the incidence of MAP DNA was significantly lower in patients with IBD. Agents with the most potent in vitro antiMAP activity were associated with clearance of blood MAP DNA. We posit that the use antiMAP antibiotics was responsible for the decreased prevalence of MAP DNA in patients with IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2052610555,"It is widely accepted that circadian physiological rhythms of the fetus are affected by oscillators in the maternal brain that are coupled to the environmental light-dark (LD) cycle.To study the link between fetal and maternal biological clocks, we investigated the effects of cycles of maternal food availability on the rhythms of Per1 gene expression in the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and liver using a transgenic rat model whose tissues express luciferase in vitro. Although the maternal SCN remained phase-locked to the LD cycle, maternal restricted feeding phase-advanced the fetal SCN and liver by 5 and 7 hours respectively within the 22-day pregnancy.Our results demonstrate that maternal feeding entrains the fetal SCN and liver independently of both the maternal SCN and the LD cycle. This indicates that maternal-feeding signals can be more influential for the fetal SCN and particular organ oscillators than hormonal signals controlled by the maternal SCN, suggesting the importance of a regular maternal feeding schedule for appropriate fetal molecular clockwork during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2011927221,"RNA Interference (RNAi) effectors have been used to inhibit rogue RNAs in mammalian cells. However, rapidly evolving sequences such as the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) require multiple targeting approaches to prevent the emergence of escape variants. Expressed long hairpin RNAs (lhRNAs) have recently been used as a strategy to produce multiple short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeted to highly variant sequences. We aimed to characterize the ability of expressed lhRNAs to generate independent siRNAs that silence three non-contiguous HIV-1 sites by designing lhRNAs comprising different combinations of siRNA-encoding sequences. All lhRNAs were capable of silencing individual target sequences. However, silencing efficiency together with concentrations of individual lhRNA-derived siRNAs diminished from the stem base (first position) towards the loop side of the hairpin. Silencing efficacy against HIV-1 was primarily mediated by siRNA sequences located at the base of the stem. Improvements could be made to first and second position siRNAs by adjusting spacing arrangements at their junction, but silencing of third position siRNAs remained largely ineffective. Although lhRNAs offer advantages for combinatorial RNAi, we show that good silencing efficacy across the span of the lhRNA duplex is difficult to achieve with sequences that encode more than two adjacent independent siRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2027546021,"Background FUS-DDIT3 is a chimeric protein generated by the most common chromosomal translocation t(12;16)(q13;p11) linked to liposarcomas, which are characterized by the accumulation of early adipocytic precursors. Current studies indicate that FUS-DDIT3- liposarcoma develops from uncommitted progenitors. However, the precise mechanism whereby FUS-DDIT3 contributes to the differentiation arrest remains to be elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we have characterized the adipocyte regulatory protein network in liposarcomas of FUS-DITT3 transgenic mice and showed that PPARγ2 and C/EBPα expression was altered. Consistent with in vivo data, FUS-DDIT3 MEFs and human liposarcoma cell lines showed a similar downregulation of both PPARγ2 and C/EBPα expression. Complementation studies with PPARγ but not C/EBPα rescued the differentiation block in committed adipocytic precursors expressing FUS-DDIT3. Our results further show that FUS-DDIT3 interferes with the control of initiation of translation by upregulation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF2 and eIF4E both in FUS-DDIT3 mice and human liposarcomas cell lines, explaining the shift towards the truncated p30 isoform of C/EBPα in liposarcomas. Suppression of the FUS-DDIT3 transgene did rescue this adipocyte differentiation block. Moreover, eIF4E was also strongly upregulated in normal adipose tissue of FUS-DDIT3 transgenic mice, suggesting that overexpression of eIF4E may be a primary event in the initiation of liposarcomas. Reporter assays showed FUS-DDIT3 is involved in the upregulation of eIF4E in liposarcomas and that both domains of the fusion protein are required for affecting eIF4E expression. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, this study provides evidence of the molecular mechanisms involve in the disruption of normal adipocyte differentiation program in liposarcoma harbouring the chimeric gene FUS-DDIT3."

Topography along the profile is characterized by a 5.2-kilometer dynamic range and 930-meter root-mean-square roughness. At long wavelengths, topography slopes eastward by 0.02 degrees , implying a variation of equatorial shape that is at least partially compensated. Sampled craters on Mercury are shallower than their counterparts on the Moon, at least in part the result of Mercury's higher gravity. Crater floors vary in roughness and slope, implying complex modification over a range of length scales."
https://openalex.org/W1972379164,"Subsaturating amounts of Bacillus subtilis SsbA, independently of the order of addition, partially inhibit the single-stranded DNA-dependent dATPase activity of RecA. This negative effect is fully overcome when a substoichiometric amount of RecO is added. SsbA added prior to RecA does not stimulate the dATP-dependent DNA strand exchange activity; however, added after RecA it enhances the extent of strand exchange. The addition of RecO stimulates RecA-mediated joint molecule formation, although it limits the accumulation of final recombination products. Thus we suggest that RecO has a dual activity: RecO acts as a RecA mediator enabling RecA to utilize SsbA-coated single-stranded DNA as a polymerization substrate and controls RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange by limiting its extent. We herein discuss the possible mechanisms of RecO involvement in the regulation of double strand break repair and genetic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2137647195,"Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a regulatory protein of the arterial wall, but its role in human atherosclerosis remains unknown. We have studied the relationships between Cav-1 abundance, atherosclerotic plaque characteristics and clinical manisfestations of atherosclerotic disease.We determined Cav-1 expression by western blotting in atherosclerotic plaques harvested from 378 subjects that underwent carotid endarterectomy. Cav-1 levels were significantly lower in carotid plaques than non-atherosclerotic vascular specimens. Low Cav-1 expression was associated with features of plaque instability such as large lipid core, thrombus formation, macrophage infiltration, high IL-6, IL-8 levels and elevated MMP-9 activity. Clinically, a down-regulation of Cav-1 was observed in plaques obtained from men, patients with a history of myocardial infarction and restenotic lesions. Cav-1 levels above the median were associated with absence of new vascular events within 30 days after surgery [0% vs. 4%] and a trend towards lower incidence of new cardiovascular events during longer follow-up. Consistent with these clinical data, Cav-1 null mice revealed elevated intimal hyperplasia response following arterial injury that was significantly attenuated after MMP inhibition. Recombinant peptides mimicking Cav-1 scaffolding domain (Cavtratin) reduced gelatinase activity in cultured porcine arteries and impaired MMP-9 activity and COX-2 in LPS-challenged macrophages. Administration of Cavtratin strongly impaired flow-induced expansive remodeling in mice. This is the first study that identifies Cav-1 as a novel potential stabilizing factor in human atherosclerosis. Our findings support the hypothesis that local down-regulation of Cav-1 in atherosclerotic lesions contributes to plaque formation and/or instability accelerating the occurrence of adverse clinical outcomes. Therefore, given the large number of patients studied, we believe that Cav-1 may be considered as a novel target in the prevention of human atherosclerotic disease and the loss of Cav-1 may be a novel biomarker of vulnerable plaque with prognostic value."
https://openalex.org/W2030745369,"Y-P30 is a polypeptide produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the maternal immune system during pregnancy. The peptide passes the blood-placenta barrier and accumulates in neurons of the developing infant brain, where it enhances survival of thalamic neurons and displays neuritogenic activities. In this study, we identify pleiotrophin (PTN) and syndecan-2 and -3 as direct binding partners of Y-P30. PTN is known to promote neurite outgrowth of thalamic neurons due to its association with the proteoglycan syndecan-3. Via spontaneous oligomerization Y-P30 can capture large macromolecular complexes containing PTN and potentially syndecans. Accordingly, the neuritogenic activity of Y-P30 in thalamic primary cultures requires the presence of PTN in the media and binding to syndecans. Thus, we propose that the neurite outgrowth promoting actions of Y-P30 during brain development are essentially based on its association with the PTN/syndecan signaling complex. This identifies a new mechanism of communication between the nervous and the immune system that might directly affect the wiring of the brain during development.

This identifies a new mechanism of communication between the nervous and the immune system that might directly affect the wiring of the brain during development. Organotypic cultures of the thalamus need a peptide factor secreted from the cortex to survive for longer periods of time. In previous work we could identify Y-P30 as the crucial factor that is released from cortical neurons and required for the survival of thalamic cultures (1Landgraf P. Sieg F. Wahle P. Meyer G. Kreutz M.R. Pape H.C. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Y-P30 (fragments of the peptide are also termed human cachexia factor (2Todorov P.

During the wiring of the fetal brain and in early postnatal development it is subsequently released from there. The factor derives from a larger precursor protein that after proteolytic cleavage gives rise to at least two bioactive peptides, dermcidin and Y-P30 (1Landgraf P. Sieg F. Wahle P. Meyer G.

Based on these initial findings we hypothesized that the immune system of the mother might directly influence brain development of the infant via secretion of Y-P30 from maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. To further prove this hypothesis we set out to identify molecular mechanisms that might underlie the broad neurotrophic and neuritogenic effects of the peptide in the fetal brain. Part of this effort was the identification of pleiotrophin (PTN) as well as syndecans 2 and 3 as Y-P30-binding partners. PTN (also designated heparin-binding growth associated molecule, HB-GAM) is a secreted protein of 136 amino acids with lysine-rich domains at the N and C termini and two separate heparin-binding thrombospondin type-1 repeat domains linked internally by a short amino acid sequence (7Li Y.S.

In the present study we show that Y-P30 fosters the formation of large Y-P30/PTN oligomers that might increase the local concentration of Y-P30/PTN at their neuronal receptor syndecan. Moreover, the neuritogenic activity of the factor in thalamic primary cultures requires the PTN-syndecan interaction, suggesting that syndecan signaling might underlie many of the actions of Y-P30 in the infant brain. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Assay—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed essentially as described in Helmuth et al. (16Helmuth M. Altrock W. Böckers T.M. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreutz M.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For the screening a pre-transformed human fetal brain cDNA library in pACT2 (MATCHMAKER GAL-4 Two-Hybrid II, Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany, yeast strain AH 109) was used. As a bait construct the entire open reading frame of the dermcidin precursor cDNA (AF144011) was cloned in-frame into pAS2-1 and pGBKT7 (MATCHMAKER GAL-4 Two-Hybrid III, Clontech), respectively. A total of 2.8 × 106 co-transformants were screened. Generation and Purification of Recombinant GST and MBP Fusion Proteins in Escherichia coli—The respective cDNAs were cloned either into pGEX5T1 (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) or pMALc2x (New England BioLabs, Hertfortshire, UK) and subsequently transformed into E. coli, strain BL21C+ (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). Overexpression of the recombinant proteins was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturers' protocols and published procedures (17Dieterich D.C. Karpova A. Mikhaylova M. Zdobnova I. König I. Landwehr M. Kreutz M. Smalla K.H. Richter K. Landgraf P. Reissner C. Böckers T.M. Zuschratter W. Spilker C. Seidenbecher C.I. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreutz M.R. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e34Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Pulldown Assays—Glutathione-Sepharose-B4 coupled GST-PTN and GST were equilibrated in 1× TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Transfected COS-7 cells expressing GFP-tagged Y-P30/dermcidin were extracted after freezing and five sonification pulses with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× TBS for 1 h and subsequently centrifuged at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min. The remaining supernatants were incubated with either 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose-B4-bound GST-PTN or GST and gently shacked in an end-over-end mixer overnight at 4 °C. After three times washing with 1× TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer. Production of MBP-PTN, MBP-Y-P30, and GFP-tagged Syndecan-2 and -3—For the syndecan binding assays a 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 250 mm NaCl was used. The amylose-bound MBP fusion proteins or MBP as a negative control were washed and equilibrated in buffer. GFP-tagged syndecan-3 and -2 were expressed in COS-7 cells. After two freezing-thawing cycles and five sonification pulses the proteins were extracted for 1 h with 1% Triton X-100 in Hepes buffer. Then the resulting homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C. The supernatants were diluted 1:5 with Hepes buffer and incubated with the respective amylose-bound MBP fusion proteins at 4 °C overnight. After three times extensive washing with 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100 the proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. To test whether the heparan sulfate side chains of syndecans are responsible for these interactions syndecan-containing cell extracts were treated with 20 milliunits/ml heparitinase I (Sigma) and 0.2 unit/ml chondroitinase A, B, and C (Sigma) before pull-down experiments were carried out. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Experiments—For SDS-PAGE or immunoblot experiments protein fractions were solubilized with 4× SDS sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 40% glycerol, 20% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.004% bromphenol blue), cooked for 5 min, and then separated on 5-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (except for syndecan-3 where 4-12% gradient gels were used). After blotting the membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in 1× TBS for 2 h. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies in 1× TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Primary Thalamic Cell Cultures—Rat thalami were prepared from embryos (Long Evans rats) at embryonic day E16 and transferred into ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution, without Mg2+/Ca2+ (HBSS, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). After washing three times with 5 ml of HBSS, 2 ml of HBSS containing 0.5% trypsin (Sigma) was added to the tissue, and the the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Next, tissue was washed again five times with 5 ml of HBSS and finally transferred into 2-ml tubes with HBSS, containing 0.01% DNase-I (Invitrogen). For dissociation thalamic tissue was three times pressed slowly through a 0.9-mm gauged needle followed by three passages through a 0.45-mm gauged needle. The remaining cell suspension was poured through a 70-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) into a 50-ml tube and filled up with 18 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). After estimating cell quantity, the suspension was diluted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to a density of 150,000 cells/ml. Finally 500 μl of this suspension were placed in each well of a 24-well plate, containing lipid-free, baked, and coated coverslips. Cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and 95% air humidity and kept in culture for 18 h. Coverslips were coated first with poly-d-lysine (Sigma), washed three times of extensively (2× sterile distilled H2O, 1× HBSS), and air dried. A second coating on top of this was performed with 10 μg/ml laminin (Sigma) in PBS supplemented with 4 μg/ml recombinant PTN (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), 6 μg/ml Y-P30 (synthetic peptide), or a mixture of both. The coverslips were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% air humidity, and subsequently extensively washed with sterile distilled H2O and HBSS(-). Immunocytochemistry and Morphological Analysis—Rat thalamic cell cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), washed three times with 10 mm PBS, and preincubated for 90 min at 4 °C in blocking solution (10 mm PBS, 10% normal horse serum, PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria), 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 5% sucrose (Merck), and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Afterward cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies in blocking solution (mouse anti-MAP-2, 1:1000, Sigma). Next day, the cultures were washed three times with 10 mm PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and incubated with secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated rabbit anti mouse IgG (H+L), 1:1500 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Finally they were washed twice with 10 mm PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, once with 10 mm PBS, and subsequently covered with Mowiol (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Images were taken using a Zeiss-AxioplanII imaging fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany), a Spot RT camera, and Meta View software (Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany). Morphological analysis was carried out with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Numbers and lengths of neurites were evaluated using Sholl analysis. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Levels of p < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Studies—Syndecan binding to MBP-PTN was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance using the Biacore 2000 system and CM5 sensor chips (Biacore AB, GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). MBP-PTN was coupled to the carboxymethylated Dextran matrix of one sensor chip cell according to the manufacturer's instructions. A second cell of the sensor chip was prepared as a reference matrix by coupling equimolar amounts of MBP alone. After equilibrating the sensor chip with flow buffer HBS-EP (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P20) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min the Dextran matrix was activated for 7 min with 50 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide/200 mm N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Subsequently MBP-PTN and MBP were immobilized separately on the surface of the respective sensor chip by applying ligand solution (10-15 μg/ml of the respective ligand in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0) for 7 min. Finally, the excess of reactive groups was deactivated with 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5 (7 min at a flow rate of 5 μl/min). The final immobilization levels of the respective ligands were 7-8 ng/mm2 cell surface. For binding studies of syndecan-2 and -3 the purified proteins were diluted to the indicated concentrations with HBS-EP. Expression of GFP-tagged Syndecan-2 and -3 in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at ∼80% confluence according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiencies and expression rates were monitored by fluorescent microscopy. To purify GFP-tagged syndecans, cell pellets were shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The suspension was again shock frozen, thawed, and treated five times with two-second strokes of sonification. Afterward the suspension was shaken for 1 h in an end-over-end mixer at 4 °C and centrifuged at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min. From supernatants GFP-tagged syndecans were purified using the μMACS™ epitope Taq protein isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were eluted with 0.1 m triethylamine and neutralized immediately. The buffer of the protein samples was exchanged against HBS-EP using Zeba™ Desalt Spin Columns (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gel-filtration Assays—Equimolar amounts of purified GST-PTN and Y-P30 peptide were preincubated in 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4 °C, and 0.8 ml of the solution was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated Hiload™16/60-Super-dex™ 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Equilibration and running buffer were used as above. The protein complexes were separated by size at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and collected in 1.5-ml fractions. Fractions were lyophilized and redissolved in 150 μl of distilled water. Finally, the samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblots. Complex sizes were calculated after calibrating the column with different reference proteins. Y-P30 Binds to PTN—Y-P30 is taken up by neurons and subsequently released into the extracellular space by yet unknown mechanisms (1Landgraf P. Sieg F. Wahle P. Meyer G. Kreutz M.R. Pape H.C. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To identify potential binding partners involved in these processes we performed a yeast-two-hybrid screen using a pretransformed fetal human brain cDNA library and the entire Y-P30-dermcidin precursor as bait. Six independent clones contained the complete open reading frame of the midkine PTN. Removal of the untranslated region and the signal peptide did not affect binding of PTN to the Y-P30-dermcidin precursor (Fig. 1A). PTN binds exclusively to the 30 amino acids encoding the Y-P30 peptide fragment as revealed by shortening the Y-P30-dermcidin cDNA (Fig. 1A) accordingly. Because the PTN-Y-P30 interaction physiologically should take place extracellularly we sought to confirm the yeast-two-hybrid data independently. To this end we performed GST-PTN pulldown assays with different Y-P30-dermcidin-GFP fusion constructs heterologously expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1B). PTN specifically pulls down a Y-P30-containing GFP-tagged protein (Fig. 1C). In controls no binding of untagged GFP to GST-PTN or vice versa GST-Sepharose to Y-P30-dermcidin precursor tagged with GFP was found (Fig. 1C). Moreover, like in yeast cells neither the presence of dermcidin nor the N-terminal signal peptide of the Y-P30-dermcidin precursor was essential for the interaction in this assay (Fig. 1C). To further prove that the interaction between PTN and Y-P30 is direct we produced and purified a bacterially expressed MBP-PTN fusion protein and a Y-P30-GFP expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1, B and D). In pulldown experiments we could confirm a direct binding of Y-P30-GFP to a MBP-PTN-amylose matrix (Fig. 1D). No binding of GFP alone was observed in control experiments (Fig. 1D). PTN and Y-P30 Associate with Syndecan-2 and -3—In previous work we identified Y-P30 immunoreactivity in neurons (1Landgraf P. Sieg F. Wahle P. Meyer G. Kreutz M.R. Pape H.C. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas PTN is mainly expressed by stem cells and glia during development (18Bloch B. Normand E. Kovesdi I. Böhlen P. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 70: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Wanaka A. Carroll S.L. Milbrandt J. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1993; 72: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because Y-P30 and PTN are secreted polypeptides their interaction in vivo in the embryonic and neonatal brain should occur in the extracellular space. During brain development PTN has a broad spectrum of neurotrophic activities linked to neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation (7Li Y.S. Milner P.G. Chauhan A.K. Watson M.A. Hoffman R.M.

Neurosci. 1999; 11: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that binding to the heparan sulfate side chains of the cell surface receptor syndecan-3 mediates these neurite outgrowth-promoting activities (14Raulo E. Tumova S. Pavlov I.

Chem. 2005; 280: 9180-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because Y-P30 displays similar activities like PTN in neuronal cultures we next tested whether both peptides associate with the most abundant syndecan family members in brain, i.e. syndecan-2 and -3. To assess whether Y-P30 can bind to endogenous syndecan-3 we performed pulldown assays with bacterially expressed MBP-Y-P30 fusion protein and solubilized membrane fractions of early postnatal rat brain. Indeed syndecan-3 is precipitated with MBP-Y-P30 as detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2A). No binding to the MBP matrix was observed in control experiments (Fig. 2A). The small size of Y-P30 and the poor quality of commercially available syndecan-3 antibodies precluded further co-immunoprecipitation experiments. To learn more about the interaction we therefore expressed Myc/GFP-tagged syndecan-2 and -3 heterologously in COS-7 cells. Like other proteoglycans both overexpressed Myc/GFP-tagged syndecans run as a smear in SDS-PAGE because of their variable decoration with heparan sulfate side chains (Fig. 2, B and C). Subsequent pulldown experiments revealed binding of MBP-PTN to syndecan-3 and syndecan-2. The latter interaction was not described previously. No binding to untagged MBP or to GFP alone was observed (Fig. 2C). Moreover, we observed a specific pulldown of both proteoglycans with the MBP-Y-P30 matrix (Fig. 2B). Of note, also smaller syndecan fragments were found in the pulldown (Fig. 2, B and C), which most likely represent degradation products from syndecan dimers (22Schulz J.G. Annert W. Vanderkerckhove J. Zimmermann P. De Strooper B. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48651-48657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that are pulled down together. A GFP-control protein associated neither with the MBP-Y-P30 nor the MBP-PTN matrix (Fig. 2D). These data confirm the binding of both peptides to syndecan-2 and -3. Previous studies suggested that the interaction of PTN with syndecan-3 requires the presence of the heparan sulfate side chains (10Kinnunen T. Raulo E. Nolo R. Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2243-2248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether removal of the carbohydrate side chains with heparatinase and chondroitinase affects binding of PTN and Y-P30 to syndecan-2 and -3 (Fig. 2D). Indeed the interaction with MBP-PTN and MBP-Y-P30 was completely abolished after the incubation of GFP-tagged syndecan-2 and -3 with both enzymes (Fig. 2, E-G). Thus, both peptides seem to interact with the heparan/chondroitin sulfate moieties of both syndecans. Interestingly, the small fragments that most likely represent deglycosylated syndecan fragments (22Schulz J.G. Annert W. Vanderkerckhove J. Zimmermann P. De Strooper B. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48651-48657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) originating from syndecan dimers are also not present in the pulldown under these conditions (Fig. 2, F and G). The Association of PTN and YP30 with Syndecans Is Not Competitive—To elucidate whether Y-P30 and PTN bind syndecans simultaneously or whether binding is competitive we next performed MBP-PTN pulldown assays in the presence of equimolar amounts of Y-P30. Notably, we found no evidence for a competition of both peptides for syndecan binding (Fig. 3A). On the contrary, addition of Y-P30 seemed to increase the association of PTN to GFP-syndecan-2 and -3 (Fig. 3B). A 1:10 dilution of the binding matrix resulted in almost undetectable syndecan levels in the pulldown assay (Fig. 3B). However, when we added Y-P30 a significant amount of GFP-syndecan-2 and -3 remained attached to the MBP-PTN matrix (Fig. 3B). This latter finding led us to ask whether Y-P30 might increase the affinity of PTN binding to syndecans. To address this question we employed surface plasmon resonance measurements with MBP-PTN captured via amide binding to the dextran matrix of the sensor chip. GFP-tagged syndecan-2 and -3 were purified from COS-7 cells (Fig. 4E). To screen for the relative affinity of GFP-syndecan-2 and -3 in the presence or absence of Y-P30 a single sensor chip was used with defined analyte concentration. We initially proved the specificity of the interaction of PTN with syndecans by recording sensorgrams with increasing concentrations of syndecans in the running buffer (Fig. 4A). However, due to the limited amount of GFP-syndecans available we were not able to saturate binding and to subsequently determine the KD. Sensorgrams with a GFP-control protein in the running buffer showed no measurable effect on resonance (Fig. 4F). Similarly, capturing MBP without PTN did not lead to a plasmon resonance response. In the next set of experiments we added increasing amounts of the untagged Y-P30 peptide. This had no effect on the recorded sensorgrams (Fig. 4, A-D), presumably due"
https://openalex.org/W1965784018,"Mechanisms of transcriptional repression are important during cell differentiation. Mammalian heterochromatin protein 1 isoforms HP1alpha, HP1beta, and HP1gamma play important roles in the regulation of chromatin structure and function. We explored the possibility of different roles for the three HP1 isoforms in an integrated system, skeletal muscle terminal differentiation. In this system, terminal differentiation is initiated by the transcription factor MyoD, whose target genes remain mainly silent until myoblasts are induced to differentiate. Here we show that HP1alpha and HP1beta isoforms, but not HP1gamma, interact with MyoD in myoblasts. This interaction is direct, as shown using recombinant proteins in vitro. A gene reporter assay revealed that HP1alpha and HP1beta, but not HP1gamma, inhibit MyoD transcriptional activity, suggesting a model in which MyoD could serve as a bridge between nucleosomes and chromatin-binding proteins such as HDACs and HP1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show a preferential recruitment of HP1 proteins on MyoD target genes in proliferating myoblasts. Finally, modulation of HP1 protein level impairs MyoD target gene expression and muscle terminal differentiation. Together, our data show a nonconventional interaction between HP1 and a tissue-specific transcription factor, MyoD. In addition, they strongly suggest that HP1 isoforms play important roles during muscle terminal differentiation in an isoform-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2033606261,"The Cacna1f(nob2) mouse is reported to be a naturally occurring null mutation for the Ca(v)1.4 calcium channel gene and the phenotype of this mouse is not identical to that of the targeted gene knockout model. We found two mRNA species in the Cacna1f(nob2) mouse: approximately 90% of the mRNA represents a transcript with an in-frame stop codon within exon 2 of CACNA1F, while approximately 10% of the mRNA represents a transcript in which alternative splicing within the ETn element has removed the stop codon. This latter mRNA codes for full length Ca(v)1.4 protein, detectable by Western blot analysis that is predicted to differ from wild type Ca(v)1.4 protein in a region of approximately 22 amino acids in the N-terminal portion of the protein. Electrophysiological analysis with either mouse Ca(v)1.4(wt) or Ca(v)1.4(nob2) cDNA revealed that the alternatively spliced protein does not differ from wild type with respect to activation and inactivation characteristics; however, while the wild type N-terminus interacted with filamin proteins in a biochemical pull-down experiment, the alternatively spliced N-terminus did not. The Cacna1f(nob2) mouse electroretinogram displayed reduced b-wave and oscillatory potential amplitudes, and the retina was morphologically disorganized, with substantial reduction in thickness of the outer plexiform layer and sprouting of bipolar cell dendrites ectopically into the outer nuclear layer. Nevertheless, the spatial contrast sensitivity (optokinetic response) of Cacna1f(nob2) mice was generally similar to that of wild type mice. These results suggest the Cacna1f(nob2) mouse is not a CACNA1F knockout model. Rather, alternative splicing within the ETn element can lead to full-length Ca(v)1.4 protein, albeit at reduced levels, and the functional Ca(v)1.4 mutant may be incapable of interacting with cytoskeletal filamin proteins. These changes, do not alter the ability of the Cacna1f(nob2) mouse to detect and follow moving sine-wave gratings compared to their wild type counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W1968553202,"Hundreds of thousands of human embryos are cultured yearly at in vitro fertilization (IVF) centers worldwide, yet the vast majority fail to develop in culture or following transfer to the uterus. However, human embryo phenotypes have not been formally defined, and current criteria for embryo transfer largely focus on characteristics of individual embryos. We hypothesized that embryo cohort-specific variables describing sibling embryos as a group may predict developmental competence as measured by IVF cycle outcomes and serve to define human embryo phenotypes.We retrieved data for all 1117 IVF cycles performed in 2005 at Stanford University Medical Center, and further analyzed clinical data from the 665 fresh IVF, non-donor cycles and their associated 4144 embryos. Thirty variables representing patient characteristics, clinical diagnoses, treatment protocol, and embryo parameters were analyzed in an unbiased manner by regression tree models, based on dichotomous pregnancy outcomes defined by positive serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG). IVF cycle outcomes were most accurately predicted at approximately 70% by four non-redundant, embryo cohort-specific variables that, remarkably, were more informative than any measures of individual, transferred embryos: Total number of embryos, number of 8-cell embryos, rate (percentage) of cleavage arrest in the cohort and day 3 follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level. While three of these variables captured the effects of other significant variables, only the rate of cleavage arrest was independent of any known variables.Our findings support defining human embryo phenotypes by non-redundant, prognostic variables that are specific to sibling embryos in a cohort."

https://openalex.org/W2025152255,"Algal-cnidarian symbiosis is one of the main factors contributing to the success of cnidarians, and is crucial for the maintenance of coral reefs. While loss of the symbionts (such as in coral bleaching) may cause the death of the cnidarian host, over-proliferation of the algae may also harm the host. Thus, there is a need for the host to regulate the population density of its symbionts. In the green hydra, Chlorohydra viridissima, the density of symbiotic algae may be controlled through host modulation of the algal cell cycle. Alternatively, Chlorohydra may actively expel their endosymbionts, although this phenomenon has only been observed under experimentally contrived stress conditions.We show, using light and electron microscopy, that Chlorohydra actively expel endosymbiotic algal cells during predatory feeding on Artemia. This expulsion occurs as part of the apocrine mode of secretion from the endodermal digestive cells, but may also occur via an independent exocytotic mechanism.Our results demonstrate, for the first time, active expulsion of endosymbiotic algae from cnidarians under natural conditions. We suggest this phenomenon may represent a mechanism whereby cnidarians can expel excess symbiotic algae when an alternative form of nutrition is available in the form of prey."

Here, we characterized the Ca2+ dependence of mGluR7a signaling in Xenopus oocytes by using channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a Ca2+-permeable, light-activated ion channel for triggering Ca2+ influx, and a GIRK3.1/3.2 concatemer to monitor mGluR7a responses. Application of the agonist (S)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutanoic acid (l-AP4) (1-100 microm) caused a dose-dependent inward current in high K+ solutions due to activation of GIRK channels by G-protein betagamma subunits released from mGluR7a. Elevation of intracellular free Ca2+ by light stimulation of ChR2 markedly increased the amplitude of L-AP4 responses, and this effect was attenuated by the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester). l-AP4 responses were potentiated by submembranous [Ca2+] levels within physiological ranges and with a threshold close to resting [Ca2+]i values, as determined by recording the endogenous Xenopus Ca2+-activated chloride conductance. Together, these results show that L-AP4-dependent mGluR7a signaling is potentiated by physiological levels of [Ca2+]i, consistent with a model in which presynaptic mGluR7a acts as a coincidence detector of Ca2+ influx and glutamate release."

In contrast, sexual cooperation is expected in social insects. Mating indeed positively affects life span and fecundity of young queens of the male-polymorphic ant Cardiocondyla obscurior, even though males neither provide nuptial gifts nor any other care but leave their mates immediately after copulation and die shortly thereafter.Here, we show that mating with winged disperser males has a significantly stronger impact on life span and reproductive success of young queens of C. obscurior than mating with wingless fighter males.Winged males are reared mostly under stressful environmental conditions, which force young queens to disperse and found their own societies independently. In contrast, queens that mate with wingless males under favourable conditions usually start reproducing in the safety of the established maternal nest. Our study suggests that males of C. obscurior have evolved mechanisms to posthumously assist young queens during colony founding under adverse ecological conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2068839747,"Background The genus Oryza is being used as a model in plant genomic studies although there are several issues still to be resolved regarding the spatio-temporal evolution of this ancient genus. Particularly contentious is whether undated transoceanic natural dispersal or recent human interference has been the principal agent determining its present distribution and differentiation. In this context, we studied the origin and distribution history of the allotetraploid CD rice genome. It is endemic to the Neotropics but the genus is thought to have originated in the Paleotropics, and there is relatively little genetic divergence between some orthologous sequences of the C genome component and their Old World counterparts. Methodology/Principal Findings Because of its allotetraploidy, there are several potential pitfalls in trying to date the formation of the CD genome using molecular data and this could lead to erroneous estimates. Therefore, we rather chose to rely on historical evidence to determine whether or not the CD genome was present in the Neotropics before the arrival of Columbus. We searched early collections of herbarium specimens and studied the reports of explorers of the tropical Americas for references to rice. In spite of numerous collectors traveling inland and collecting Oryza, plants determined as CD genome species were not observed away from cultivated rice fields until 1869. Various arguments suggest that they only consisted of weedy forms until that time. Conclusions/Significance The spatio-temporal distribution of herbarium collections fits a simple biogeographical scenario for the emergence in cultivated rice fields followed by radiation in the wild of the CD genome in the Neotropics during the last four centuries. This probably occurred from species introduced to the Americas by humans and we found no evidence that the CD genome pre-existed in the Old World. We therefore propose a new evolutionary hypothesis for such a recent origin of the CD genome. Moreover, we exemplify how an historical approach can provide potentially important information and help to disentangle the timing of evolutionary events in the history of the Oryza genomes."
