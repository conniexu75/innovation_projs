https://openalex.org/W2050140768,"Many aspects of cellular function depend on when and where in the cell various protein activities are turned 'on' or 'off' at the molecular level. A new technique that uses light to manipulate the activity of a protein at precise times and places within the living cell has the potential make the study of this fundamental aspect of protein function a practical proposition. It makes use of a genetically encoded, photoactivatable derivative of Rac1, a GTPase that regulates actin cytoskeletal dynamics, which can be activated by exposure to laser light. This localized activation generates precisely localized cell protrusions and ruffling and can direct cell motility. This approach should be extensible to other proteins. The precise spatiotemporal dynamics of protein activity remain poorly understood, yet they can be critical in determining cell behaviour. A genetically encoded, photoactivatable version of the protein Rac1, a key GTPase regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics, has now been produced; this approach enables the manipulation of the activity of Rac1 at precise times and places within a living cell, thus controlling motility. The precise spatio-temporal dynamics of protein activity are often critical in determining cell behaviour, yet for most proteins they remain poorly understood; it remains difficult to manipulate protein activity at precise times and places within living cells. Protein activity has been controlled by light, through protein derivatization with photocleavable moieties1 or using photoreactive small-molecule ligands2. However, this requires use of toxic ultraviolet wavelengths, activation is irreversible, and/or cell loading is accomplished via disruption of the cell membrane (for example, through microinjection). Here we have developed a new approach to produce genetically encoded photoactivatable derivatives of Rac1, a key GTPase regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics in metazoan cells3,4. Rac1 mutants were fused to the photoreactive LOV (light oxygen voltage) domain from phototropin5,6, sterically blocking Rac1 interactions until irradiation unwound a helix linking LOV to Rac1. Photoactivatable Rac1 (PA-Rac1) could be reversibly and repeatedly activated using 458- or 473-nm light to generate precisely localized cell protrusions and ruffling. Localized Rac activation or inactivation was sufficient to produce cell motility and control the direction of cell movement. Myosin was involved in Rac control of directionality but not in Rac-induced protrusion, whereas PAK was required for Rac-induced protrusion. PA-Rac1 was used to elucidate Rac regulation of RhoA in cell motility. Rac and Rho coordinate cytoskeletal behaviours with seconds and submicrometre precision7,8. Their mutual regulation remains controversial9, with data indicating that Rac inhibits and/or activates Rho10,11. Rac was shown to inhibit RhoA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, with inhibition modulated at protrusions and ruffles. A PA-Rac crystal structure and modelling revealed LOV–Rac interactions that will facilitate extension of this photoactivation approach to other proteins."

Although apoptosis is the most rapid mechanism for eliminating cells lacking appropriate ECM attachment, recent reports suggest that non-apoptotic death processes prevent survival when apoptosis is inhibited in matrix-deprived cells. Here we demonstrate that detachment of mammary epithelial cells from ECM causes an ATP deficiency owing to the loss of glucose transport. Overexpression of ERBB2 rescues the ATP deficiency by restoring glucose uptake through stabilization of EGFR and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) activation, and this rescue is dependent on glucose-stimulated flux through the antioxidant-generating pentose phosphate pathway. Notably, we found that the ATP deficiency could be rescued by antioxidant treatment without rescue of glucose uptake. This rescue was found to be dependent on stimulation of fatty acid oxidation, which is inhibited by detachment-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). The significance of these findings was supported by evidence of an increase in ROS in matrix-deprived cells in the luminal space of mammary acini, and the discovery that antioxidants facilitate the survival of these cells and enhance anchorage-independent colony formation. These results show both the importance of matrix attachment in regulating metabolic activity and an unanticipated mechanism for cell survival in altered matrix environments by antioxidant restoration of ATP generation."
https://openalex.org/W2117403796,"The Rho GTPase family acts in concert to regulate cyoskeletal dynamics during processes such as cell motility. In this study, Danuser and colleagues study the coordination of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 during cell migration by simultaneously visualizing two molecules using complementary biosensor designs, and by computationally defining the relationships between individual molecules visualized in separate cells. The latter approach demonstrates that different biosensors, imaged separately, can be freely combined to produce maps of relative signalling activities with seconds and single-micron resolution. These technologies pave the way to defining the dynamics of many proteins in large signal transduction networks. The Rho GTPase family is involved in the control of cytoskeleton dynamics, but the spatiotemporal coordination of each element (Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42) remains unknown. Here, GTPase coordination in mouse embryonic fibroblasts is examined both through simultaneous visualization of two GTPase biosensors and using a computational approach. The GTPases Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42 act together to control cytoskeleton dynamics1,2,3. Recent biosensor studies have shown that all three GTPases are activated at the front of migrating cells4,5,6,7, and biochemical evidence suggests that they may regulate one another: Cdc42 can activate Rac1 (ref. 8), and Rac1 and RhoA are mutually inhibitory9,10,11,12. However, their spatiotemporal coordination, at the seconds and single-micrometre dimensions typical of individual protrusion events, remains unknown. Here we examine GTPase coordination in mouse embryonic fibroblasts both through simultaneous visualization of two GTPase biosensors and using a ‘computational multiplexing’ approach capable of defining the relationships between multiple protein activities visualized in separate experiments. We found that RhoA is activated at the cell edge synchronous with edge advancement, whereas Cdc42 and Rac1 are activated 2 μm behind the edge with a delay of 40 s. This indicates that Rac1 and RhoA operate antagonistically through spatial separation and precise timing, and that RhoA has a role in the initial events of protrusion, whereas Rac1 and Cdc42 activate pathways implicated in reinforcement and stabilization of newly expanded protrusions."

https://openalex.org/W2126774748,"The isolation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offers a new strategy for modelling human disease. Recent studies have reported the derivation and differentiation of disease-specific human iPSCs. However, a key challenge in the field is the demonstration of disease-related phenotypes and the ability to model pathogenesis and treatment of disease in iPSCs. Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a rare but fatal peripheral neuropathy, caused by a point mutation in the IKBKAP gene involved in transcriptional elongation. The disease is characterized by the depletion of autonomic and sensory neurons. The specificity to the peripheral nervous system and the mechanism of neuron loss in FD are poorly understood owing to the lack of an appropriate model system. Here we report the derivation of patient-specific FD-iPSCs and the directed differentiation into cells of all three germ layers including peripheral neurons. Gene expression analysis in purified FD-iPSC-derived lineages demonstrates tissue-specific mis-splicing of IKBKAP in vitro. Patient-specific neural crest precursors express particularly low levels of normal IKBKAP transcript, suggesting a mechanism for disease specificity. FD pathogenesis is further characterized by transcriptome analysis and cell-based assays revealing marked defects in neurogenic differentiation and migration behaviour. Furthermore, we use FD-iPSCs for validating the potency of candidate drugs in reversing aberrant splicing and ameliorating neuronal differentiation and migration. Our study illustrates the promise of iPSC technology for gaining new insights into human disease pathogenesis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2070029806,"A decision is a commitment to a proposition or plan of action based on evidence and the expected costs and benefits associated with the outcome. Progress in a variety of fields has led to a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms that evaluate evidence and reach a decision. Several formalisms propose that a representation of noisy evidence is evaluated against a criterion to produce a decision. Without additional evidence, however, these formalisms fail to explain why a decision-maker would change their mind. Here we extend a model, developed to account for both the timing and the accuracy of the initial decision, to explain subsequent changes of mind. Subjects made decisions about a noisy visual stimulus, which they indicated by moving a handle. Although they received no additional information after initiating their movement, their hand trajectories betrayed a change of mind in some trials. We propose that noisy evidence is accumulated over time until it reaches a criterion level, or bound, which determines the initial decision, and that the brain exploits information that is in the processing pipeline when the initial decision is made to subsequently either reverse or reaffirm the initial decision. The model explains both the frequency of changes of mind as well as their dependence on both task difficulty and whether the initial decision was accurate or erroneous. The theoretical and experimental findings advance the understanding of decision-making to the highly flexible and cognitive acts of vacillation and self-correction."

However, the presence of multiple quantum phases within a single sample complicates the interpretation of bulk measurements. Nathan Gemelke et al. report a direct imaging method that enables a complete characterization of multiple phases in a strongly correlated Bose gas. Ultracold atoms held in an optical lattice are an important system in which to study quantum phase transitions. However, the presence of multiple quantum phases within a single sample complicates the interpretation of bulk measurements. Here, a direct imaging method is reported that enables a complete characterization of multiple phases in a strongly correlated Bose gas. The observation of the superfluid to Mott insulator phase transition of ultracold atoms in optical lattices1 was an enabling discovery in experimental many-body physics, providing the first tangible example of a quantum phase transition (one that occurs even at zero temperature) in an ultracold atomic gas. For a trapped gas, the spatially varying local chemical potential gives rise to multiple quantum phases within a single sample, complicating the interpretation of bulk measurements1,2,3,4,5. Here we report spatially resolved, in-situ imaging of a two-dimensional ultracold atomic gas as it crosses the superfluid to Mott insulator transition, providing direct access to individual characteristics of the insulating, superfluid and normal phases. We present results for the local compressibility in all phases, observing a strong suppression in the insulator domain and suppressed density fluctuations for the Mott insulator, in accordance with the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. Furthermore, we obtain a direct measure of the finite temperature of the system. Taken together, these methods enable a complete characterization of multiple phases in a strongly correlated Bose gas, and of the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations in the quantum critical regime."
https://openalex.org/W2074674763,"A stochastic background of gravitational waves is expected to arise from a superposition of a large number of unresolved gravitational-wave sources of astrophysical and cosmological origin. It is expected to carry unique signatures from the earliest epochs in the evolution of the universe, inaccessible to the standard astrophysical observations. Direct measurements of the amplitude of this background therefore are of fundamental importance for understanding the evolution of the universe when it was younger than one minute. Here we report direct limits on the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational-wave background using the data from a two-year science run of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). Our result constrains the energy density of the stochastic gravitational-wave background normalized by the critical energy density of the universe, in the frequency band around 100 Hz, to be less than 6.9 x 10^{-6} at 95% confidence. The data rule out models of early universe evolution with relatively large equation-of-state parameter, as well as cosmic (super)string models with relatively small string tension that are favoured in some string theory models. This search for the stochastic background improves upon the indirect limits from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background at 100 Hz."

https://openalex.org/W2165316559,"Androgens are essential for normal spermatogenesis and male fertility, but how androgens exert this effect remains uncertain. Androgen receptors (ARs) are expressed in several testicular cell types, but continuing uncertainty exists over which cell type mediates androgen control of spermatogenesis. Androgen signaling via Sertoli cells (SCs) is essential for complete spermatogen-esis, but the role for androgen signaling via peritubular myoid (PTM) cells is contentious. To address this controversy, we generated PTM-specific AR-knockout (PTM-ARKO) mice in which gross reproductive development was normal, but all PTM-ARKO males were azoospermic and infertile. Testis weight was reduced beyond puberty, and in adulthood there was an 86% reduction in germ cells, compared with wild-type littermates. These changes were not explained by any deficits in testosterone, lutein-izing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations. SC function was impaired in PTM-ARKO males, indicated by reduced seminiferous tubule fluid production and reduced expression of some androgen-depen-dent SC genes. Androgen action via PTM cells is therefore essential for normal testis function, spermatogenesis, and fertility in males. This study also provides the first direct evidence for the importance of androgen-driven stromal-epithelial interactions underpinning the regulation of spermatogenesis; PTM-ARKO mice will enable identification of the new molecular pathways involved.— Welsh, M., Saunders, P.

https://openalex.org/W2024626049,"Several facultative anaerobic bacteria with potential therapeutic abilities are known to preferentially colonize solid tumors after systemic administration. How they efficiently find and invade the tumors is still unclear. However, this is an important issue to be clarified when bacteria should be tailored for application in cancer therapy.We describe the initial events of colonization of an ectopic transplantable tumor by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Initially, after intravenous administration, bacteria were found in blood, spleen, and liver. Low numbers were also detected in tumors associated with blood vessels as could be observed by immunohistochemistry. A rapid increase of TNF-alpha in blood was observed at that time, in addition to other pro-inflammatory cytokines. This induced a tremendous influx of blood into the tumors by vascular disruption that could be visualized in H&E stainings and quantified by hemoglobin measurements of tumor homogenate. Most likely, together with the blood, bacteria were flushed into the tumor. In addition, blood influx was followed by necrosis formation, bacterial growth, and infiltration of neutrophilic granulocytes. Depletion of TNF-alpha retarded blood influx and delayed bacterial tumor-colonization.Our findings emphasize similarities between Gram-negative tumor-colonizing bacteria and tumor vascular disrupting agents and show the involvement of TNF-alpha in the initial phase of tumor-colonization by bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2032321427,"Activity is presumed to help shape the connectivity within neural circuits, with differences often leading to the elimination of less active connections. Here, to challenge this notion, a subpopulation of bipolar cells was inactivated during development, yet retinal ganglion cells still received input from them, albeit through fewer synapses. This occurred through a reduced rate of synapse formation rather than an increase in synapse elimination. Synaptogenesis and connectivity within a parallel processing stream of bipolar cell input converging onto the same retinal ganglion cell were unaffected. These observations reveal an unexpected and independent role for activity in regulating the rate of synapse formation rather than elimination for specific set of inputs during circuit formation in vivo. Activity is thought to help shape connectivity within neural circuits, with differences often leading to the elimination of less active connections. In order to imbalance neurotransmission from different sets of inputs in vivo, a subpopulation of bipolar cells was inactivated during development. The results reveal an unexpected and remarkably selective role for activity in circuit development, regulating synapse formation but not elimination. Activity is thought to guide the patterning of synaptic connections in the developing nervous system. Specifically, differences in the activity of converging inputs are thought to cause the elimination of synapses from less active inputs and increase connectivity with more active inputs1,2. Here we present findings that challenge the generality of this notion and offer a new view of the role of activity in synapse development. To imbalance neurotransmission from different sets of inputs in vivo, we generated transgenic mice in which ON but not OFF types of bipolar cells in the retina express tetanus toxin (TeNT). During development, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) select between ON and OFF bipolar cell inputs (ON or OFF RGCs) or establish a similar number of synapses with both on separate dendritic arborizations (ON-OFF RGCs). In TeNT retinas, ON RGCs correctly selected the silenced ON bipolar cell inputs over the transmitting OFF bipolar cells, but were connected with them through fewer synapses at maturity. Time-lapse imaging revealed that this was caused by a reduced rate of synapse formation rather than an increase in synapse elimination. Similarly, TeNT-expressing ON bipolar cell axons generated fewer presynaptic active zones. The remaining active zones often recruited multiple, instead of single, synaptic ribbons. ON-OFF RGCs in TeNT mice maintained convergence of ON and OFF bipolar cells inputs and had fewer synapses on their ON arbor without changes to OFF arbor synapses. Our results reveal an unexpected and remarkably selective role for activity in circuit development in vivo, regulating synapse formation but not elimination, affecting synapse number but not dendritic or axonal patterning, and mediating independently the refinement of connections from parallel (ON and OFF) processing streams even where they converge onto the same postsynaptic cell."
https://openalex.org/W2081150563,"Unregulated transcription of antisense RNAs is potentially deleterious to a cell because sense–antisense pairing could affect gene expression. In this study, Zofall et al. examine how antisense transcription is held in check in fission yeast. They find that the variant histone H2A.Z, which localizes to the 5′ ends of genes, cooperates with heterochromatin and RNA interference factors to mediate suppression of antisense transcription. Unregulated transcription of noncoding and antisense RNAs is potentially deleterious to a cell and the accumulation of these transcripts is suppressed by several mechanisms. How cells differentiate coding RNAs from transcripts targeted for degradation is not clear. The variant histone H2A.Z, in cooperation with heterochromatin and RNAi factors, is now found to mediate suppression of antisense transcripts in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Eukaryotic transcriptomes are characterized by widespread transcription of noncoding and antisense RNAs1,2,3, which is linked to key chromosomal processes, such as chromatin remodelling, gene regulation and heterochromatin assembly4,5,6,7. However, these transcripts can be deleterious, and their accumulation is suppressed by several mechanisms including degradation by the nuclear exosome8,9. The mechanisms by which cells differentiate coding RNAs from transcripts targeted for degradation are not clear. Here we show that the variant histone H2A.Z, which is loaded preferentially at the 5′ ends of genes by the Swr1 complex containing a JmjC domain protein, mediates suppression of antisense transcripts in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome. H2A.Z is partially redundant in this regard with the Clr4 (known as SUV39H in mammals)-containing heterochromatin silencing complex that is also distributed at euchromatic loci, and with RNA interference component Argonaute (Ago1). Loss of Clr4 or Ago1 alone has little effect on antisense transcript levels, but cells lacking either of these factors and H2A.Z show markedly increased levels of antisense RNAs that are normally degraded by the exosome. These analyses suggest that as well as performing other functions, H2A.Z is a component of a genome indexing mechanism that cooperates with heterochromatin and RNAi factors to suppress read-through antisense transcripts."

https://openalex.org/W2009569524,"Background The MYC oncogene contributes to induction and growth of many cancers but the full spectrum of the MYC transcriptional response remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Using microarrays, we conducted a detailed kinetic study of genes that respond to MYCN or MYCNΔMBII induction in primary human fibroblasts. In parallel, we determined the response to steady state overexpression of MYCN and MYCNΔMBII in the same cell type. An overlapping set of 398 genes from the two protocols was designated a ‘Core MYC Signature’ and used for further analysis. Comparison of the Core MYC Signature to a published study of the genes induced by serum stimulation revealed that only 7.4% of the Core MYC Signature genes are in the Core Serum Response and display similar expression changes to both MYC and serum. Furthermore, more than 50% of the Core MYC Signature genes were not influenced by serum stimulation. In contrast, comparison to a panel of breast cancers revealed a strong concordance in gene expression between the Core MYC Signature and the basal-like breast tumor subtype, which is a subtype with poor prognosis. This concordance was supported by the higher average level of MYC expression in the same tumor samples. Conclusions/Significance The Core MYC Signature has clinical relevance as this profile can be used to deduce an underlying genetic program that is likely to contribute to a clinical phenotype. Therefore, the presence of the Core MYC Signature may predict clinical responsiveness to therapeutics that are designed to disrupt MYC-mediated phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2093728029,"Clinical observations and mouse models have suggested that inflammation can be pro-tumorigenic. Since chemokines are critical in leukocyte trafficking, we hypothesized that chemokines play essential roles in inflammation-associated cancers. Screening for 37 chemokines in prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts revealed CXCL16, the ligand for the receptor CXCR6, as the most consistently expressed chemokine. Immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence and confocal imaging of 121 human prostate specimens showed that CXCL16 and CXCR6 were co-expressed, both on prostate cancer cells and adjacent T cells. Expression levels of CXCL16 and CXCR6 on cancer cells correlated with poor prognostic features including high-stage and high-grade, and expression also correlated with post-inflammatory changes in the cancer stroma as revealed by loss of alpha-smooth muscle actin. Moreover, CXCL16 enhanced the growth of CXCR6-expressing cancer and primary CD4 T cells. We studied expression of CXCL16 in an additional 461 specimens covering 12 tumor types, and found that CXCL16 was expressed in multiple human cancers associated with inflammation. Our study is the first to describe the expression of CXCL16/CXCR6 on both cancer cells and adjacent T cells in humans, and to demonstrate correlations between CXCL16 and CXCR6 vs. poor both prognostic features and reactive changes in cancer stoma. Taken together, our data suggest that CXCL16 and CXCR6 may mark cancers arising in an inflammatory milieu and mediate pro-tumorigenic effects of inflammation through direct effects on cancer cell growth and by inducing the migration and proliferation of tumor-associated leukocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1991038321,"It is well known that certain cognitive abilities decline with age. The ability to form certain new declarative memories, particularly memories for facts and events, has been widely shown to decline with advancing age. In contrast, the effects of aging on the ability to form new procedural memories such as skills are less well known, though it appears that older adults are able to acquire some new procedural skills over practice. The current study examines the effects of normal aging on procedural memory more closely by comparing the effects of aging on the encoding or acquisition stage of procedural learning versus its effects on the consolidation, or between-session stage of procedural learning. Twelve older and 14 young participants completed a sequence-learning task (the Serial Reaction Time Task) over a practice session and at a re-test session 24 hours later. Older participants actually demonstrated more sequence skill during acquisition than the young. However, older participants failed to show skill improvement at re-test as the young participants did. Age thus appears to have a differential effect upon procedural learning stages such that older adults' skill acquisition remains relatively intact, in some cases even superior, compared to that of young adults, while their skill consolidation may be poorer than that of young adults. Although the effect of normal aging on procedural consolidation remains unclear, aging may actually enhance skill acquisition on some procedural tasks."
https://openalex.org/W1998198313,"The dimeric motor protein kinesin-1 converts chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work used to transport cargo along microtubules. Cargo attached to the kinesin stalk moves processively in 8-nm increments as its twin motor domains (heads) carry out an asymmetric, 'hand-over-hand' walk. The extent of individual head interactions with the microtubule during stepping, however, remains controversial. A major experimental limitation has been the lack of a means to monitor the attachment of an individual head to the microtubule during movement, necessitating indirect approaches. Here we report the development of a single-molecule assay that can directly report head binding in a walking kinesin molecule, and show that only a single head is bound to the microtubule between steps at low ATP concentrations. A bead was linked to one of the two kinesin heads by means of a short DNA tether and used to apply rapidly alternating hindering and assisting loads with an optical trap. The time-dependent difference between forwards and backwards displacements of the bead alternated between two discrete values during stepping, corresponding to those intervals when the linked head adopted a bound or an unbound state. The linked head could only rebind the microtubule once ATP had become bound to its partner head."
https://openalex.org/W1988876705,"Carnocyclin A (CclA) is a potent antimicrobial peptide from Carnobacterium maltaromaticum UAL307 that displays a broad spectrum of activity against numerous Gram-positive organisms. An amide bond links the N and C termini of this bacteriocin, imparting stability and structural integrity to this 60-amino acid peptide. CclA interacts with lipid bilayers in a voltage-dependent manner and forms anion selective pores. Several other circular bacteriocins have been reported, yet only one (enterocin AS-48) has been structurally characterized. We have now determined the solution structure of CclA by NMR and further examined its anion binding and membrane channel properties. The results reveal that CclA preferentially binds halide anions and has a structure that is surprisingly similar to that of AS-48 despite low sequence identity, different oligomeric state, and disparate function. CclA folds into a compact globular bundle, comprised of four helices surrounding a hydrophobic core. NMR studies show two fluoride ion binding modes for CclA. Our findings suggest that although other circular bacteriocins are likely to have diverse mechanisms of action, many may have a common structural motif. This shared three-dimensional arrangement resembles the fold of mammalian saposins, peptides that either directly lyse membranes or serve as activators of lipid-degrading enzymes."

We investigated the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of these genes with obesity and metabolic traits. Methodology/Principal Findings In a population of 166 200 young men examined at the draft boards, obese men (n = 726, BMI≥31.0 kg/m2) and a randomly selected group (n = 831) were re-examined at two surveys at mean ages 46 and 49 years (S-46, S-49). Anthropometric, physiological and biochemical measures were available. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess age-adjusted odds ratios. No significant associations were observed of 5HT2A rs6311, 5HT2C rs3813929 and COMT rs4680 with obesity, except that COMT rs4680 GG-genotype was associated with fat-BMI (OR = 1.08, CI = 1.01–1.16). The SNPs were associated with a number of physiological variables; most importantly 5HT2C rs3813929 T-allele was associated with glucose (OR = 4.56, CI = 1.13–18.4) and acute insulin response (OR = 0.65, CI = 0.44–0.94) in S-49. COMT rs4680 GG-genotype was associated with glucose (OR = 1.04, CI = 1.00–1.09). Except for an association between 5HT2A rs6311 and total-cholesterol at both surveys, significant in S-46 (OR = 2.66, CI = 1.11–6.40), no significant associations were observed for the other phenotypes. Significant associations were obtained when combined genotype of 5HT2C rs3813929 and COMT rs4680 were examined in relation to BMI (OR = 1.12, CI = 1.03–1.21), fat-BMI (OR = 1.22, CI = 1.08–1.38), waist (OR = 1.13, CI = 1.04–1.22), and cholesterol (OR = 5.60, CI = 0.99–31.4). Analyses of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) revealed, a 12.3% increased frequency of 5HT2C rs3813929 T-allele and an 11.6% increased frequency of COMT rs4680 GG-genotype in individuals with IGT or T2D (χ2, p = 0.05 and p = 0.06, respectively). Examination of the combined genotypes of 5HT2C and COMT showed a 34.0% increased frequency of IGT or T2D (χ2, p = 0.01). Conclusions The findings lend further support to the involvement of serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine pathways on obesity and glucose homeostasis, in particular when combined genotype associations are explored."

This trial was a randomized parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy study to compare CDA and artemether−lumefantrine (AL) efficacy in uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria and further define the CDA safety profile, particularly its hematological safety in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) -deficient patients. Methods and Findings The trial was conducted at medical centers at 11 sites in five African countries between June 2006 and August 2007. 1372 patients (≥1 to <15 years old, median age 3 years) with acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were randomized (2∶1) to receive CDA 2/2.5/4 mg/kg once daily for three days (N = 914) or six-doses of AL over three days (N = 458). Non-inferiority of CDA versus AL for efficacy was evaluated in the Day 28 per-protocol (PP) population using parasitological cure (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-corrected). Cure rates were 94.1% (703/747) for CDA and 97.4% (369/379) for AL (treatment difference –3.3%, 95%CI –5.6, −0.9). CDA was non-inferior to AL, but there was simultaneous superiority of AL (upper 95%CI limit <0). Adequate clinical and parasitological response at Day 28 (uncorrected for reinfection) was 79% (604/765) with CDA and 83% (315/381) with AL. In patients with a G6PD-deficient genotype (94/603 [16%] hemizygous males, 22/598 [4%] homozygous females), CDA had the propensity to cause severe and clinically concerning hemoglobin decreases: the mean hemoglobin nadir was 75 g/L (95%CI 71, 79) at Day 7 versus 97 g/L (95%CI 91, 102) for AL. There were three deaths, unrelated to study medication (two with CDA, one with AL). Conclusions Although parasitologically effective at Day 28, the hemolytic potential of CDA in G6PD-deficient patients makes it unsuitable for use in a public health setting in Africa.

Dbf4 alone binds tightly to Mcm2, whereas Cdc7 alone binds weakly to Mcm2, suggesting that Dbf4 recruits Cdc7 to phosphorylate Mcm2. DDK phosphorylates two serine residues of Mcm2 near the N terminus of the protein, Ser-164 and Ser-170. Expression of mcm2-S170A is lethal to yeast cells that lack endogenous MCM2 (mcm2Δ); however, this lethality is rescued in cells harboring the DDK bypass mutant mcm5-bob1.

Dbf4 alone binds tightly to Mcm2, whereas Cdc7 alone binds weakly to Mcm2, suggesting that Dbf4 recruits Cdc7 to phosphorylate Mcm2. DDK phosphorylates two serine residues of Mcm2 near the N terminus of the protein, Ser-164 and Ser-170. Expression of mcm2-S170A is lethal to yeast cells that lack endogenous MCM2 (mcm2Δ); however, this lethality is rescued in cells harboring the DDK bypass mutant mcm5-bob1. We conclude that DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2 is required for cell growth. The Cdc7 protein kinase is required throughout the yeast S phase to activate origins (1Bousset K. Diffley J.F.

Nevertheless, the physiologic role of DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2 is a matter of dispute. In human cells, replacement of MCM2 DDK-phosphoacceptor residues with alanines inhibits DNA replication, suggesting that Dbf4-Cdc7 phosphorylation of Mcm2 in humans is important for DNA replication (20Tsuji T.

In contrast, mutation of putative DDK phosphorylation sites at the N terminus of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mcm2 results in viable cells, suggesting that phosphorylation of S. pombe Mcm2 by DDK is not critical for cell growth (10Masai H.

For example, the multimeric state of the active Dbf4-Cdc7 complex is currently disputed. A heterodimer of fission yeast Cdc7 (Hsk1) in complex with fission yeast Dbf4 (Dfp1) can phosphorylate Mcm2 (7Brown G.W. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22083-22090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, in budding yeast, oligomers of Cdc7 exist in the cell (27Shellman Y.G. Schauer I.E. Oshiro G. Dohrmann P. Sclafani R.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and Dbf4-Cdc7 exists as oligomers of 180 and 300 kDa (27Shellman Y.G. Schauer I.E.

Although the sequences of the Mcm N termini are poorly conserved, the DDK sites identified in each study have neighboring acidic residues. The residues of budding yeast Mcm2 that are phosphorylated by DDK have not yet been identified. In this study, we find that budding yeast Cdc7 is weakly active as a multimer in phosphorylating Mcm2. However, a low molecular weight form of Dbf4-Cdc7, likely a heterodimer, has a higher specific activity for phosphorylation of Mcm2. Dbf4 or DDK, but not Cdc7, binds tightly to Mcm2, suggesting that Dbf4 recruits Cdc7 to Mcm2. DDK phosphorylates two serine residues of Mcm2, Ser-164 and Ser-170, in an acidic region of the protein. Mutation of Ser-170 is lethal to yeast cells, but this phenotype is rescued by the DDK bypass mutant mcm5-bob1. We conclude that DDK phosphorylation of Ser-170 of Mcm2 is required for budding yeast growth. Preparation of plasmids, proteins, and yeast strains are described in the supplemental material. The Superose 6 size exclusion column was pre-equilibrated in gel filtration solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl. 200 μg of Cdc7 alone or 200 μg of Cdc7 alone with 50 μg of Dbf4 were first incubated for 30 min at 15 °C. The samples were then subjected to Superose 6 size exclusion chromatography in gel filtration solution. Each fraction was then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie staining. 7 μl of each column fraction was incubated with 500 ng of full-length Mcm2 and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a final volume of 10 μl for 30 min at 30 °C, and the reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimaging. Kinase reactions were in a volume of 10 μl and contained 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 μm cold ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1.5 μg of DDK, as indicated for each reaction. The amount of Mcm2 in each reaction is described in the figure legends. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Reactions were stopped by addition of 5 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer (25% glycerol, 200 mm Tris base, 125 mm DTT, 2.5% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue), and the products were resolved on either 10 or 15% SDS-PAGE. Mcm proteins were first radiolabeled in a reaction volume of 100 μl that contained 20 μm full-length or fragment Mcm2 protein in kinase reaction buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 500 μm ATP, 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) containing 5 μg of PKA. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The 100-μl GST-pulldown reaction contained 50 pmol of GST-tagged protein in GST-binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and varying amounts of radiolabeled protein as described in each figure. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Following incubation, reactions were added to 40 μl of prepared glutathione-Sepharose and gently mixed. Binding of GST-tagged protein to the beads was performed for 20 min, with gentle mixing every few minutes. Once the binding was complete, the reaction mixture was aspirated, and the beads were washed two times with 0.5 ml of GST binding buffer. After the last wash, 30 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer were added to each reaction, and the samples were boiled for 10 min. Samples (20 μl) were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. DNA sequencing and mass spectroscopy were performed by the Vanderbilt University Facilities. The molecular architecture of the active Dbf4-Cdc7 kinase is currently not known. To determine the functionally active state of Cdc7, the protein was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1A). Cdc7 eluted in a peak at a Stokes radius that corresponded to that of a 232-kDa standard (Fig. 1A, top gel). The predicted molecular mass of Cdc7 is 58 kDa, suggesting that the majority of Cdc7 is in a tetrameric state. The elution of Cdc7 in neighboring fractions suggests that Cdc7 may be a mixture of tetramer and other forms. These results are consistent with in vivo data that Cdc7 alone exists as a multimer in the cell (27Shellman Y.G. Schauer I.E. Oshiro G. Dohrmann P. Sclafani R.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To test if Cdc7 alone is active as a kinase at Mcm2, each fraction from the size exclusion column was incubated with Mcm2 and [γ-32P]ATP and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging (Fig. 1A, bottom gel). Cdc7 alone phosphorylates Mcm2 to low levels at a Stokes radius that corresponds to a 232-kDa protein (Fig. 1, C and D, open diamonds). These data suggest that a tetrameric from of Cdc7 alone is weakly active in phosphorylating Mcm2. To determine the functionally active state of Dbf4-Cdc7, Dbf4 was incubated with excess Cdc7, and the protein mixture was then subjected to size exclusion chromatography. Once again, a peak of Cdc7 alone was present at a Stokes radius that corresponded to a 232-kDa protein. However, an additional low abundance peak of Cdc7 and Dbf4 is present in a fraction that peaks at a Stokes radius that is between 68 and 158 kDa (Fig. 1B, top gel). The molecular mass of one subunit of Dbf4 plus one subunit of Cdc7 is 139 kDa, suggesting that this complex is a heterodimer of Dbf4-Cdc7. Dbf4 was not observed in the higher molecular weight fractions, suggesting that Dbf4 does not bind to multimeric Cdc7. The elution fractions were then analyzed for phosphorylation of Mcm2, and peak phosphorylation levels were observed at a molecular mass between 68 and 158 kDa (Fig. 1, B, bottom gel, and C and D, filled triangles). Low levels of Cdc7 are present in the peak activity fractions, suggesting that a heterodimer of Dbf4-Cdc7 has a substantially higher specific activity for phosphorylating Mcm2 compared with the Cdc7 multimer (100-fold difference in specific activity, see Fig. 1D). Taken together, the data of Fig. 1 suggest that Cdc7 forms a multimer that is weakly active in phosphorylating Mcm2. Moreover, Dbf4 can bind to and activate a monomer of Cdc7, and the Dbf4-Cdc7 heterodimer has substantially higher specific activity than Cdc7 alone (100-fold higher specific activity). The data from Fig. 1 demonstrate that Dbf4 activates Cdc7 phosphorylation of Mcm2. We next investigated if Dbf4 alone, Cdc7 alone, or the complex of Dbf4-Cdc7 (DDK) binds to Mcm2. These data may help elucidate whether Dbf4 binds to Mcm2 to recruit Cdc7 or if Dbf4 activates Cdc7 that is pre-bound to Mcm2. To quantify Mcm2, an amino acid sequence bearing a kinase recognition site for protein kinase A was added to the N terminus of Mcm2. Protein kinase A (PKA) does not phosphorylate Mcm2 in vivo, and this sequence was added solely for the purpose of accurate quantitation. We mixed PKA-labeled full-length Mcm2 with GST-DDK, GST-Dbf4, or GST-Cdc7 and then isolated complexes bearing GST with glutathione beads (GST pulldown, Fig. 2A). When 6.6 pmol (66 nm), 20 pmol (200 nm), or 66 pmol (660 nm) of Mcm2 was added to the 100-μl binding reactions, more than half of the Mcm2 bound to GST-Dbf4-Cdc7 (GST-DDK) or GST-Dbf4 proteins (Fig. 2B). Thus, GST-DDK or GST-Dbf4 binds tightly to full-length Mcm2. In contrast, GST-Cdc7 binds weakly to Mcm2, because Mcm2 binding levels were only slightly greater than those achieved with GST alone (Fig. 2, A and B). The weak binding of Cdc7 to Mcm2 is consistent with the size exclusion data, which demonstrate that high concentrations of Cdc7 alone phosphorylate Mcm2 to very low levels (Fig. 1A). We next determined whether the Mcm2-7 complex also binds to DDK, Dbf4, or Cdc7, because the Mcm2-7 complex provides the motor function for the replication fork helicase (29Bochman M.L. Schwacha A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 287-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 30Schwacha A. Bell S.P. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 4491-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We reconstituted Mcm2-7 complexes as described previously (31Davey M.J. Indiani C. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4491-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), except the Mcm3 subunit in this complex bears a PKA site. Using the same GST-pulldown approach, we found that the PKA-labeled Mcm2-7 complex binds tightly to Dbf4 or DDK but weakly to Cdc7 (Fig. 2, A and C). DDK phosphorylates multiple subunits within the Mcm2-7 complex; thus, the binding we observe for this complex likely reflects DDK or Dbf4 binding to different Mcm subunits within the Mcm2-7 complex. The data in Fig. 2 suggest that Dbf4 does not activate Cdc7 that is pre-bound to Mcm2. It is more likely that Dbf4 binds to Mcm2 and then recruits Cdc7 to activate phosphorylation of Mcm2. It is also possible the Dbf4 first binds to Cdc7, and the DDK complex then binds to and phosphorylates Mcm2. We next analyzed the region of Mcm2 that is phosphorylated by DDK. Based on structure-guided sequence alignment with Methanothermobacter thermoautrophicus Mcm (32Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), we constructed an Mcm2 region (1–278) that spans the poorly conserved N-terminal region and most of the A domain (Fig. 3A). The A domain is an α-helical bundle in the M. thermoautrophicus Mcm crystal structure (32Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). M. thermoautrophicus Mcm that lacks this region is active as a helicase, suggesting that the N-terminal region and A domain are not directly involved in Mcm helicase function (33Kasiviswanathan R. Shin J.H. Melamud E. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28358-28366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). DDK phosphorylates Mcm2-(1–278) to high specific activity relative to full-length Mcm2 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, Mcm2-(279-C) is not phosphorylated by DDK. These data suggest that DDK phosphorylates only the N-terminal region and/or A domain of Mcm2 (Mcm2-(1–278)). The DDK binding and kinase regions of budding yeast Mcm2 are unknown; thus, we investigated the action of DDK at Mcm2-(1–278) in further detail. We first constructed a series of N-terminal fragments of Mcm2 and tested the ability of DDK to phosphorylate these regions (Fig. 4, A and B). DDK was active in phosphorylating Mcm2-(1–203) and Mcm2-(1–182), but DDK did not phosphorylate Mcm2-(1–160) or Mcm2-(1–100) (Fig. 4A). These data suggest that amino acids 161–182 are critical for DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2. When DDK phosphorylation is plotted as a function of Mcm2 fragment concentration, the importance of amino acids 161–182 is evident (Fig. 4B). The plot also reveals that at low concentrations of Mcm2, region 204–278 is important for maximal DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2. We next tested the ability of DDK to bind to Mcm2 fragments to identify the region for DDK docking on Mcm2. GST-DDK pulldown of PKA-radiolabeled Mcm2 fragments was accomplished, and the quantity of Mcm2 fragment bound as a function of input amount was plotted (Fig. 4C). A slight increase in binding is detected as Mcm2 fragment length is increased from 1–160 to 1–182, suggesting that residues 161–182 bind weakly to DDK. A substantial increase in binding is observed as the Mcm2 fragment length is increased from 1–203 to 1–278. These data suggest that region 204–278 binds tightly to DDK. Regions 161–182 and 204–278 of Mcm2 are important for DDK activity. We next dissected the importance of these regions in further detail by investigating DDK phosphorylation and binding of two Mcm2 internal fragments Mcm2-(183–278) and Mcm2-(155–278). DDK phosphorylated Mcm2-(155–278) to high levels at low concentrations of Mcm2-(155–278) (Fig. 4D). In contrast, DDK was completely inactive in phosphorylating Mcm2-(183–278) (Fig. 4D). However, DDK was roughly equally efficient in binding to each of these Mcm2 fragments (Fig. 4E). Therefore, the substantial difference in phosphorylation between Mcm2-(155–278) and Mcm2-(183–278) may reflect the presence of a DDK phosphoacceptor sites between residues 155 and 182 of Mcm2. Hence, a model that is consistent with all of the data in Fig. 5 is that DDK binds tightly to region 204–278 of Mcm2 and DDK phosphorylates region 161–182 of Mcm2 (Fig. 4F). Fragment analysis suggests that DDK phosphorylates region 161–182 of Mcm2 (Fig. 4). There are two serine residues present in region 161–182 of Mcm2, Ser-164 and Ser-170 (Fig. 5A). To determine whether Ser-164 and Ser-170 are phosphorylated by DDK, these residues were mutated to alanine, and DDK phosphorylation and binding were examined. S614A exhibited a slight defect in DDK phosphorylation compared with wild-type Mcm2-(1–278), whereas S170A was modestly defective in DDK phosphorylation (Fig. 5, B and C). The double mutant S164A/S170A was not phosphorylated by DDK at all (Fig. 5, B and C). The Dbf4 binding profiles of these mutants were also determined (Fig. 5D). Dbf4 bound to wild-type Mcm2-(1–278), S164A, S170A, and S164A/S170A with similar efficiency (Fig. 5D). Because S164A/S170A binds Dbf4 with nearly wild-type efficiency, but is not phosphorylated by DDK at all, the data suggest that DDK phosphorylates Ser-164 and Ser-170 of Mcm2. Sequence alignment between budding yeast Mcm2 and budding yeast Mcm4 reveals that the DDK phosphorylation sites on Mcm2 are in the same region as the DDK phosphorylation sites on Mcm4 (Fig. 5E). In budding yeast Mcm4, seven serine and threonine residues between residues 161 and 178 are likely phosphoacceptor sites for DDK (26Sheu Y.J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In budding yeast Mcm2, the two serine residues between residues 161 and 178 are phosphorylated by DDK. Thus, although the number of residues phosphorylated by DDK is different, the region of Mcm that is phosphorylated by DDK is conserved between budding yeast Mcm2 and Mcm4. These regions are also acidic in both proteins. Sequence alignment between budding yeast Mcm2 and human Mcm2 reveals that the DDK phosphorylation sites are not conserved (Fig. 5F). Although there is some disagreement as to the particular residues of human Mcm2 that are phosphorylated by DDK (10Masai H. Taniyama C. Ogino K. Matsui E. Kakusho N. Matsumoto S. Kim J.M. Ishii A.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4459-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), in every published study the human DDK phosphorylation sites do not align with those found here for budding yeast Mcm2. To determine whether DDK phosphorylation of Ser-164 of Mcm2 is required for cell growth, we performed plasmid-shuffle assays in budding yeast cells lacking endogenous MCM2 (mcm2Δ) (Fig. 6). The deletion is complemented by wild-type MCM2 under expression control of its native promoter on a low copy centromere plasmid bearing a URA3 marker. The cells also contain a plasmid that expresses either wild-type of mutant MCM2 under control of the GAL1, galactose-inducible promoter. As expected, the cultures grow equivalently on media containing galactose (Fig. 6A, right). Growth on media containing 5-FOA and galactose selects for cells that have lost the URA3 complementing plasmid and are expressing only the MCM2 allele (or empty vector) indicated to the left of Fig. 6A. As seen in 10-fold serial dilutions, the mcm2S164A allele complements nearly as well as wild type in this background, a result confirmed by measuring the growth rates of cells taken from the 5-FOA plates and grown in media containing galactose (Fig. 6B, top graph). These results suggest that DDK phosphorylation of S164A is not required for yeast cell growth. A similar experimental strategy was then used to determine whether DDK phosphorylation of Ser-170 of Mcm2 is required for yeast cell growth. When mcm2Δ cells were grown in the presence of galactose and 5-FOA, cells expressing mcm2S170A did not grow at all at any dilution, in marked contrast to the growth of cells expressing mcm2S164A or wild-type MCM2 (Fig. 6A, top left panel). These data suggest that Ser-170 of Mcm2 is required for yeast cell growth. Serine 170 of Mcm2 is a target of DDK phosphorylation, but it may also be required for an additional unknown function. To determine whether the cell death caused by expression of mcm2S170A is related to DDK function, the plasmid-shuffle assay was performed in cells harboring the genetic bypass for DDK function, mcm5-bob1. These cells are also deleted for CDC7 (cdc7Δ). When mcm2Δ,mcm5-bob1,cdc7Δ cells were grown in the presence of galactose and 5-FOA, cells expressing mcm2S170A grew on agar plates in serial 10-fold dilutions, whereas cells harboring the vector alone were dead at every dilution (Fig. 6A, bottom left panel). Thus, the mcm5-bob1 DDK bypass rescues the cellular defect caused by the expression of mcm2S170A, suggesting that the lethality of mcm2S170A is primarily due to the absence of DDK phosphorylation of Ser-170 of Mcm2. It is not clear why mcm5-bob1 cells expressing mcm2S170A required higher concentrations to grow on agar plates compared with cells expressing wild-type MCM2, but it may be that in the mcm2Δ,mcm5-bob1,cdc7Δ strain, MCM2-Ser-170 is involved in a Cdc7-independent function. This is the first study of an mcm mutant with a lethal phenotype that is rescued by mcm5-bob1. mcm2Δ,mcm5-bob1,cdc7Δ yeast colonies grown in galactose and 5-FOA were then grown in galactose-containing liquid media, and the rate of growth was determined (Fig. 6B, bottom graph). mcm5-bob1 cells expressing mcm2S164A grew, although the rate of growth was slightly decreased compared with cells expressing wild-type MCM2 for unknown reasons. Cells expressing mcm2S170A grew in liquid media, albeit slightly less fast than cells expressing wild-type MCM2, suggesting that the lethal phenotype of mcm2S170A in Δmcm2 cells is related to DDK phosphorylation of Ser-170 (Fig. 6B, bottom graph). Taken together, the data strongly support that DDK phosphorylation of Ser-170 of Mcm2 is required for budding yeast cell growth. In this study we find that Cdc7 exists in solution primarily as a multimer, and this species at high concentrations is weakly active in phosphorylating Mcm2. Dbf4 binds to a low molecular weight form of Cdc7, forming what might be a heterodimer of Dbf4-Cdc7, and this species phosphorylates Mcm2 with substantially higher specific activity. Dbf4 alone binds tightly to Mcm2, whereas Cdc7 alone binds weakly to Mcm2, suggesting that Dbf4 recruits Cdc7 to phosphorylate Mcm2. DDK phosphorylates Mcm2-(1–278) but not Mcm2-(279-C). DDK phosphorylates Ser-164 and Ser-170 of budding yeast Mcm2, and these two serine residues are positioned in a highly acidic region. Although expression of mcm2S164A supports cell growth, expression of mcm2S170A does not. However, the lethality of mcm2S170A is rescued by the DDK-bypass mutation mcm5-bob1. We conclude that DDK phosphorylation of Ser-170 of Mcm2 is required for normal cell growth. In this study we report that Cdc7 alone is a multimer that is weakly active in phosphorylating Mcm2. Cdc7 is present at high levels during G1 and S phase, whereas Dbf4 levels peak in S phase (18Oshiro G. Owens J.C. Shellman Y. Sclafani R.A. Li J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that Cdc7 activity during G1 is physiologically relevant, given the low levels of Mcm2 phosphorylation observed in this study, and no activity was reported in other investigations (7Brown G.W. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22083-22090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast, we report that Dbf4-Cdc7 is stable as a low molecular weight form, likely a heterodimer, and this species phosphorylates Mcm2 to substantially higher levels than Cdc7 alone. Thus, during S phase, Dbf4 may bind to a monomer of Cdc7, thereby forming a highly active heterodimer. The high molecular weight form of Cdc7 may be less active than the monomeric form because the high molecular weight form does not efficiently bind to Dbf4 or Mcm2. If this model is correct, multimerization of Cdc7 may be an auto-inhibitory mechanism to prevent high level Cdc7-phosphorylation of Mcm2 in the absence of Dbf4 (Fig. 7A). We also find that Dbf4 and DDK bind tightly to Mcm2 and the Mcm2-7 complex but that Cdc7 alone does not bind tightly to these Mcm proteins. Thus, Dbf4 may recruit Cdc7 to Mcm2 and to the Mcm2-7 complex (Fig. 7B). Our in vitro data are consistent with a previously published in vivo report suggesting that Dbf4 recruits Cdc7 to origins of replication (23Dowell S.J. Romanowski P. Diffley J.F. Science. 1994; 265: 1243-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and a recent study suggesting that Dbf4 recruits Cdc7 to Mcm2-7 complexes that are tightly bound to origins (24Francis L.I. Randell J.C. Takara T.J. Uchima L. Bell S.P. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). DDK phosphorylates the N termini of Mcm2 and Mcm4 in budding yeast cells (26Sheu Y.J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the DDK phosphorylation site region is conserved between these two proteins (Fig. 4) (26Sheu Y.J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The Dbf4 docking region for the kinase is positioned between residues 204 and 278 of Mcm2. This region corresponds to residues 201–275 of Mcm4. Region 175–333 of Mcm4 has been previously identified as the DDK-docking site of Mcm4 (26Sheu Y.J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that a conserved mode of binding occurs for Dbf4 docking to Mcm2 and Mcm4, with phosphorylation of serines and threonines in a region N-terminal to the conserved docking domain. Interestingly, the function of DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2 may be different from that of Mcm4. Whereas DDK phosphorylation of the Mcm4 residues is important for cell growth, it is not required (26Sheu Y.J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In contrast, DDK phosphorylation of Ser-170 of Mcm2 is required for yeast cell growth (Fig. 7C). Thus, although the mechanism of DDK binding and phosphorylation may be conserved between Mcm2 and Mcm4, the relationship to cell growth is somewhat different. Studies with S. pombe suggest some functional redundance between Mcm4 and Mcm6 (10Masai H. Taniyama C. Ogino K. Matsui E. Kakusho N. Matsumoto S. Kim J.M. Ishii A. Tanaka T. Kobayashi T. Tamai K. Ohtani K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39249-39261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). One possibility is that DDK phosphorylation of Mcm4 is redundant with DDK phosphorylation of another Mcm protein, such as Mcm6, whereas DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2 does not have a redundant counterpart. In this study, the lethal phenotype of Mcm2S170A is rescued by the mcm5-bob1 mutation, providing very strong evidence that DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2 is required for budding yeast cell growth. In a previous study of human cells, mutation of DDK phosphorylation sites to alanine resulted in inhibition of DNA replication, whereas mutation of these sites to glutamate did not (20Tsuji T. Ficarro S.B. Jiang W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4459-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, data from yeast and human support the notion that DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2 is essential for DNA replication and cell growth. These results suggest that the function of DDK at Mcm2 is conserved from yeast to human. Interestingly, the DDK phosphorylation sites of human Mcm2 do not align with the kinase sites of yeast Mcm2. We speculate that although the function of DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2 is conserved from yeast to human, the mechanistic details may be slightly different between these species. DDK phosphorylation of serine 170 of Mcm2 is required for cell growth, but what is the function of this phosphorylation? The N-terminal region and A domain of budding yeast Mcm2 encompasses the Dbf4 docking domain and Cdc7 kinase site. The homologous region of the archaeal Mcm is dispensable for helicase activity for archaeal Mcms (33Kasiviswanathan R. Shin J.H. Melamud E. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28358-28366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34Barry E.R. McGeoch A.T. Kelman Z. Bell S.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 988-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggesting that DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2 does not directly activate Mcm2-7 helicase function. Importantly, DDK phosphorylation of budding yeast Mcm4 or human Mcm4 is important for the loading of Cdc45 at origins of replication (10Masai H. Taniyama C. Ogino K. Matsui E. Kakusho N. Matsumoto S.

Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Thus, DDK phosphorylation of Mcm proteins likely influences the binding of key helicase accessory proteins such as Cdc45. However, the relationship between DDK phosphorylation of Mcm4 and Cdc45 binding is complex, because overexpression of Cdc45 is lethal to strains expressing mutations of mcm4 deficient in DDK phosphorylation (26Sheu Y.J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of Mcms by DDK does not appear to directly stimulate the interaction between Mcms and Cdc45. In this study, we report that DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2 can be suppressed by a mutation in mcm5 (mcm5-bob1). Changes in the conformation of Mcm5 as a result of the mcm5-bob1 mutation have recently been reported (35Hoang M.L. Leon R.P. Pessoa-Brandao L. Hunt S. Raghuraman M.K. Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J. Sclafani R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7594-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that phosphorylation of Ser 170 of Mcm2 may be partially mimicked by a conformational change in a different Mcm subunit (Mcm5) (Fig. 7D). Interestingly, Mcm5 is positioned adjacent to Mcm2 in the Mcm2-7 complex (31Davey M.J. Indiani C. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4491-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 36Bochman M.L. Bell S.P. Schwacha A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5865-5873Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We propose that DDK phosphorylation of Ser-170 of Mcm2 results in a conformational change in the Mcm2-7 complex that allows for the proper positioning of accessory proteins, such as Cdc45 and GINS, which ultimately leads to the activation of the replication fork helicase (Fig. 7E).

This var gene is more conserved than other PfEMP1/var genes and is found in all P. falciparum isolates. In isolates 3D7, FCR3/It4 and HB3, var2csa is transcribed from a sub-telomeric position on the left arm of chromosome 12, but it is not known if this location is conserved in all parasites. Genome sequencing indicates that the var2csa gene is duplicated in HB3, but whether this is true in natural populations is uncertain.To assess global variation in the VAR2CSA protein, sequence variation in the DBL2X region of var2csa genes in 54 P.falciparum samples was analyzed. Chromosome mapping of var2csa loci was carried out and a quantitative PCR assay was developed to estimate the number of var2csa genes in P.falciparum isolates from the placenta of pregnant women and from the peripheral circulation of other malaria patients. Sequence analysis, gene mapping and copy number quantitation in P.falciparum isolates indicate that there are at least two loci and that both var2csa-like genes can be transcribed. All VAR2CSA DBL2X domains fall into one of two distinct phylogenetic groups possessing one or the other variant of a large (approximately 26 amino acid) dimorphic motif, but whether either motif variant is linked to a specific locus is not known.Two or more related but distinct var2csa-type PfEMP1/var genes exist in many P. falciparum isolates. One gene is on chromosome 12 but additional var2csa-type genes are on different chromosomes in different isolates. Multiplicity of var2csa genes appears more common in infected placentae than in samples from non-pregnant donors indicating a possible advantage of this genotype in pregnancy associated malaria."

The extracellular segments of ADAMs contain a prodomain that gets cleaved off during secretion, a metalloproteinase-like domain, a disintegrin domain, and a cysteine-rich domain, which are shared by SVMPs and ADAMTSs, and a unique epidermal growth factor-like domain preceding the transmembrane segment. All ADAMs contain metalloproteinase-like domains, but in humans, only 13 of the 21 members in the family possess the complete zinc binding environment (the HEXGHXXGXXHD sequence motif and the Met turn) in the domain (10Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Stöckler W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Although these proteolytically active ADAMs can shed cell-surface proteins from the plasma membrane, the other ADAMs are suggested to be non-enzymatic cell adhesion molecules (11Pruessmeyer J.

Several ADAMs have been reported to interact with integrins, and the disintegrin-like domains of ADAMs have been suggested for this interaction (13Lu X. Lu D. Scully M.F. Kakkar V.V. Cardiovasc. Hematol. Agents Med. Chem. 2007; 5: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Despite these suggestions, structural proof that the ADAMs without canonical zinc-binding motif lack enzymatic activities has been absent, and it remains unclear how these molecules are structurally configured to support protein-protein interaction instead of ectodomain shedding. ADAM22 (also named MDC2), one of such postulated non-catalytic ADAMs, was recently identified to serve as the postsynaptic receptor for the secreted neurotransmission modulator LGI-1 at neural synapses (14Fukata Y. Adesnik H. Iwanaga T. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Fukata M. Science. 2006; 313: 1792-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The study supports that some ADAMs can function as adhesion molecules rather than metalloproteinases. ADAM22 is predominantly expressed in the nervous systems (15Novak U. J. Clin. Neurosci. 2004; 11: 227-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Sagane K. Yamazaki K. Mizui Y. Tanaka I. Gene. 1999; 236: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Adam22−/− mice suffered from hypomyelination of peripheral nerves, leading to ataxia, and died before weaning (17Sagane K. Hayakawa K. Kai J. Hirohashi T. Takahashi E. Miyamoto N. Ino M. Oki T. Yamazaki K. Nagasu T. BMC Neurosci. 2005; 6: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). At the synapse, LGI-1 and ADAM22 form a tertiary complex with postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), a major scaffolding protein localized to the postsynaptic density of brain synapses, which is associated with α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor and other signaling proteins (14Fukata Y.

In this complex, the extracellular domain of ADAM22 interacts with LGI-1, whereas its cytoplasmic PDZ-binding motif recruits PSD-95.

In addition, despite a low resolution electron microscopic (EM) analysis of the soluble form of pro-ADAM12, which suggested that the prodomain represents one of the leaves of the four-leaf clover-shaped ADAM12 (30Wewer U.M. Mörgelin M. Holck P. Jacobsen J. Lydolph M.C. Johnsen A.H. Kveiborg M. Albrechtsen R. J. Biol.

Here we report the crystal structure of the entire ectodomain of mature ADAM22. Sf9 cells were maintained in suspension in HyQ SFX media containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum; High Five cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in HyQ SFX without serum. A cDNA fragment encoding the ectodomain of human ADAM22 (residue 26–736), attached to a C-terminal 7-His tag, was subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcGP67A using restriction sites BamHI and NotI. The construct and the BacVector-3000 baculovirus DNA (EMD Chemicals) were used to co-transfect sf9 cells in 6-well plates in the presence of Insect GeneJuice transfection reagent (EMD Chemicals). After incubation of the transfected cells at 27 °C for 5 days, the resulted low titer virus stock was harvested. High titer viruses were generated by infecting 200 ml of Sf9 cells at 2 × 106 cells/ml at 0.1 multiplicity of infection. The amplified viruses were harvested when all cells showed cytopathic effects. The amplified viruses were used to infect 6 liters of High Five cells at a density of 1.8 × 106 cells/ml and at a multiplicity of infection of 10. 68 h after transfection, the conditioned media were harvested, concentrated, and buffer-exchanged into HBS (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% w/v NaN3). The proteins were captured by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose resin (Qiagen), washed extensively with HBS, and eluted with 300 mm imidazole. For crystallization, the proteins were deglycosylated by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase F3, and then treated with bovine carboxypeptidase A overnight at room temperature for His tag removal. The digested products were further purified by gel filtration chromatography with a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated and eluted with HBS. The fractions containing mature ADAM22 were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Crystallization was performed using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals were obtained from drops composed of 0.5 μl of reservoir solution and 0.5 μl of protein solution equilibrated against 1 ml of 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, and 5% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Crystals grew to their maximum dimensions (∼0.15 × 0.10 × 0.05 mm3) in 10 days. Crystals were cryoprotected in the presence of 25% ethylene glycol in the mother liquor and immediately flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. To prepare a heavy ion derivative, crystals were quick-soaked with a cryosolution containing 0.3 m sodium iodide before being flash-cooled. Data sets were collected at 100 K at the LS-CAT beamline 21-ID-D, the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne, IL. The data were processed with HKL2000 (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

To complete the model, partial molecular phases were calculated with the program CNS (33Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

SIRAS phases with an overall figure of merit of 0.39 for the reflections in the 20–3.3 Å resolution range were calculated with CNS. Following density modification with 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging, the electron density map allowed the tracing of the remaining domains. The models were rebuilt using the software COOT (34Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and subjected to simulated annealing, minimization, and group B factor refinements with CNS. The calcium ions and the carbohydrate moieties were modeled as guided by the SIGMAA-weighted Fo − Fc omit map. Water molecules were automatically introduced using CNS and manually edited. A summary of the refinement statistics is given in Table 1. Backbones of protein structures were superimposed with the program TOP3D in CCP4 (35Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Buried surface areas were calculated in CNS. Surface complementarity coefficients were calculated with the program Sc in CCP4 (35Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Calorimetric titrations were carried out on a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal, Northhampton, MA) at 30 °C. Fully glycosylated ADAM22 with no His tag was incubated with 5 mm EDTA for 30 min for calcium stripping and then loaded to a Superdex 200 size exclusion column to separate protein aggregates and excessive EDTA. The protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard (Pierce). 0.012 mm ADAM22 was placed in the reaction chamber, and deionized water was placed in the reference chamber. 0.5 mm CaCl2, the titrant, was prepared with the identical lot of HBS used for ADAM22 purification. Both the titrant and the protein sample were thoroughly degassed before titration. The titrant was then injected into the reaction chamber in 3-μl increments at 5-min intervals with stirring at 286 rpm. The titration data, measured over 35 consecutive injections, were processed with the MicroCal Origin software, version 5.0. The entire ectodomain of ADAM22, including both the N-terminal prosequence and the C-terminal mature sequence, was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector for expression in insect cells. The recombinant proteins were captured from conditioned media by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid binding to the C-terminal His tag of ADAM22. As shown in Fig. 1A, ADAM22 was secreted as a mixture of three peptides: the uncleaved full-length peptide, the mature ADAM22, and the propeptide. The cleaved propeptide has no affinity tag but was still pulled down together with the mature peptide, indicating a direct, non-covalent binding between the propeptide and mature ADAM22. The cleaved propeptide associated with mature ADAM22 had the same elution profile as the uncleaved full-length ADAM22, suggesting that the binding geometry between the propeptides and the mature peptides does not change much upon cleavage. A standalone population of mature ADAM22 existed, indicating that the propeptide can be lost over the time course of expression. Mature ADAM22 elutes in gel filtration at an apparent size of ∼60 kDa, in line with the apparent size in SDS-PAGE, supporting that it is monomeric in solution. The cleaved propeptide was stable in gel filtration, consistent with the previous report that the prodomain of ADAM22 expressed in Escherichia coli could be folded and had its own structure (36Sørensen H.P. Jacobsen J. Nielbo S. Poulsen F.M. Wewer U.M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 61: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The propeptide likely exists as a dimer as its apparent molecular weight in gel filtration is only slightly less than that of mature, monomeric ADAM22. In support of this, the propeptide-containing ADAM22, cleaved or uncleaved, also appears as a dimer as it elutes at an apparent size (∼180 kDa) much larger than the monomeric size as shown in SDS-APGE (∼90 kDa). The dimerization of propeptide-containing ADAM22 is likely mediated by the propeptide but not the mature ADAM22. To verify the role of the propeptide in ADAM22, an ADAM22 fragment without the propeptide (residues 226–736), immediately following the putative furin cleavage site RSKR (residues 221–224), was constructed for expression in insect cells, but no expression was observed. This suggests that the propeptide of ADAM22 is essential for ADAM22 secretion and may play an intramolecular chaperone function, similar to the cases of ADAM17 and ADAM12 (37Leonard J.D. Lin F. Milla M.E. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 38Loechel F. Overgaard M.T. Oxvig C. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13427-13433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In physiological conditions, the propeptide is likely cleaved by furin-like proprotein convertases and may fall off mature ADAM22 more easily than in the baculovirus expression system as the physiological expression level is much lower. When overexpressed, however, the propeptide may get processed incompletely due to the limitation of processing capacity intrinsic to the cells. Therefore, the propeptide-containing ADAM22 in the extracellular space that we observed may not represent a functional form of ADAM22. The non-covalent association of the propeptide with the mature protein has also been observed for ADAM12 when it is highly expressed in pregnancy serum or in transfected mammalian cells, but the propeptide was suggested to be an integral part of mature ADAM12 (30Wewer U.M. Mörgelin M. Holck P. Jacobsen J. Lydolph M.C. Johnsen A.H. Kveiborg M. Albrechtsen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9418-9422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), in contrast to the previous observation that mature ADAM12 lacking the propeptide was the predominant form present at the cell surface (39Cao Y. Kang Q. Zhao Z. Zolkiewska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26403-26411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Hence, for ADAM12 and other ADAM family members, it remains to be further clarified whether their propeptides are essential to the functional form of proteins. The structure of mature ADAM22 without the propeptide, determined with the SIRAS method, contains two ADAM22 molecules in the asymmetric unit related by a non-crystallographic two-fold axis. The interface between the two molecules is relatively small and hydrophilic, suggesting that the mature ADAM22 ectodomain is monomeric but not dimeric, in agreement with the gel filtration results. Viewed from the front, the ADAM22 ectodomain has four domains assembled together like a four-leaf clover, and each leaf represents one of the four domains, including the metalloproteinase-like domain (domain M, residues 233–435), the disintegrin domain (domain D, residues 445–529), the cysteine-rich domain (domain C, residues 530–676), and the epidermal growth factor-like domain (domain E, residues 677–718) (Fig. 1B). Viewed from the top, the molecule is roughly flat. The overall dimensions of ADAM22 are 80 × 70 × 40 Å. The largest domain in the four-leaf clover, domain M, is most likely distal to the cell membrane. Following domain M, domain D and domain C zigzagged to domain E in a compact, but not extended, fashion. A 15-amino acid linker, not seen in the structure, leads the C terminus of domain E to the membrane. Each ADAM22 contains three putative calcium ions, one in domain M and two in domain D, and three N-linked glycans at Asn-519, Asn-634, and Asn-675. There are numerous interdomain interactions in ADAM22 reinforcing the compact overall structure. Notably, the D, C, and E domains have a continuous hydrophobic core and appear to be an integral module (hereafter termed the DCE module) mediated by extensive and seamless interfaces between domains (Fig. 1C). Interdomain segmental flexibility is highly unlikely within this module. Domain M is held in a concave face of the rigid DCE module, supported by a long stretch of interactions between domain M and domain D, and a small, round patch between domain M and domain C. An ∼10-amino acid-long linker peptide connects domain M and the DCE module. There is no direct contact between domain M and domain E. The locations of the M, D, and C domains in ADAM22 roughly resemble the locations of these domains in the SVMPs including VAP-1, VAP-2, and RVV-X (24Igarashi T. Araki S. Mori H. Takeda S. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2416-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Takeda S. Igarashi T. Mori H. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5859-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Takeda S. Igarashi T. Mori H. Araki S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2388-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, overlaying the SVMP structures to ADAM22 revealed that there is a large position shift of domain D and domain C in ADAM22 relative to the corresponding domains in the SVMPs (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S1). VAP-1 is an open, C-shaped molecule with no interaction between domain M and domain C; its interactions between domain M and domain D are limited to the domain junction, where the two domains are much closer to each other than in ADAM22. The C-shaped conformation of VAP-1 is therefore enabled entirely by the extensive interactions at the domain boundary. VAP-2 is similar to VAP-1. RVV-X has a closed C-shaped structure in which nonspecific contacts are found between domain M and domain C, and its D–C arm is positioned far differently from the counterpart in ADAM22 and is docked on a different side of domain M from that in ADAM22 (supplemental Fig. S1). The clover-shaped mature ADAM22 may, to some extent, be similar to the clover-shaped, propeptide-bound ADAM12 as revealed by EM (30Wewer U.M. Mörgelin M. Holck P. Jacobsen J. Lydolph M.C. Johnsen A.H. Kveiborg M. Albrechtsen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9418-9422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The EM study placed the ADAM12 prodomain at roughly the position of ADAM22 domain C. Therefore, if the prodomain was taken out from the reconstructed EM envelope, the overall shape of mature ADAM12 would be dramatically different from mature ADAM22. The sequence identity between ADAM12 and ADAM22 is moderate (∼35%). It remains to be clarified wh"
https://openalex.org/W2013925839,"Gram-negative binding protein 3 (GNBP3), a pattern recognition receptor that circulates in the hemolymph of Drosophila, is responsible for sensing fungal infection and triggering Toll pathway activation. Here, we report that GNBP3 N-terminal domain binds to fungi upon identifying long chains of beta-1,3-glucans in the fungal cell wall as a major ligand. Interestingly, this domain fails to interact strongly with short oligosaccharides. The crystal structure of GNBP3-Nter reveals an immunoglobulin-like fold in which the glucan binding site is masked by a loop that is highly conserved among glucan-binding proteins identified in several insect orders. Structure-based mutagenesis experiments reveal an essential role for this occluding loop in discriminating between short and long polysaccharides. The displacement of the occluding loop is necessary for binding and could explain the specificity of the interaction with long chain structured polysaccharides. This represents a novel mechanism for beta-glucan recognition."

The main species of Aβ are 40 and 42 amino acids in length. Aβ42 is much more amyloidogenic than Aβ40 because of its two additional hydrophobic amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal end of the peptide (3Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Mizusawa H. Nukina N.

Although increased production of Aβ has been implicated in the onset of familial forms of AD, it has been hypothesized that the more common sporadic forms of AD may be caused by the impaired clearance of Aβ peptides from the CNS. Several major pathways for Aβ clearance have been proposed including receptor-mediated cellular uptake, blood-brain barrier transport into the circulation, and direct proteolytic degradation (4Deane R.

In the latter case, several proteinases or peptidases have been identified that are capable of degrading Aβ, including neprilysin (7Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y. Watanabe K. Sekiguchi M. Hosoki E.

The “classic” myelin basic proteins (MBP) are major structural components of myelin sheaths accounting for 30% of total myelin protein. There are four different major isoforms generated from alternative splicing with molecular masses of 17.3, 18.5, 20.2, and 21.5 kDa. The 18.5-kDa variant, composed of 180 amino acids including 19 Arg and 12 Lys basic residues, is most abundant in mature myelin (19Givogri M.I. Bongarzone E.R. Campagnoni A.T. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). One of the major functions of MBP is to hold together the cytoplasmic leaflets of myelin membranes to maintain proper compaction of the myelin sheath through the electrostatic interaction between the positive Arg and Lys residues of MBP and the negatively charged phosphate groups of the membrane lipid (20Staugaitis S.M. Colman D.R. Pedraza L. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). MBP plays an important role in the pathology of multiple sclerosis, which is an autoimmune disease characterized by demyelination within white matter (21Kornek B. Lassmann H. Brain Res. Bull. 2003; 61: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that purified MBP exhibits autocleavage activity, generating distinct peptide fragments (22D'Souza C.A. Wood D.D. She Y.M. Moscarello M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12905-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, serine 151 was reported as the active site serine residue involved in autocatalysis. In the early stages of AD, appreciable and diffuse myelin breakdown in the white matter is observed (23Bartzokis G. Cummings J.L. Sultzer D. Henderson V.W. Nuechterlein K.H. Mintz J. Arch. Neurol. 2003; 60: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Also, in white matter regions there are much fewer fibrillar amyloid deposits than are commonly found in gray matter regions. Recently, our laboratory has shown that MBP strongly interacts with Aβ peptides and prevents their assembly into mature amyloid fibrils (24Hoos M.D. Ahmed M. Smith S.O. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9952-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Hoos M.D. Ahmed M. Smith S.O. Van Nostrand W.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Through the course of these studies we observed that upon longer incubations the levels of Aβ peptides were reduced upon treatment with MBP. In light of this observation, coupled with the report that MBP possesses proteolytic activity, we hypothesized that MBP may degrade Aβ peptides. In the present study, we show that purified human brain MBP and recombinantly expressed human MBP can degrade soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides in vitro. Purified MBP also degraded fibrillar Aβ in vitro. Mass spectrometry analysis identified distinct degradation products generated from soluble and fibrillar Aβ digestion by MBP. Furthermore, purified MBP degraded parenchymal and vascular fibrillar amyloid deposits in situ in the brain tissue of APP transgenic mice. Together, these findings indicate that purified MBP possesses Aβ degrading activity in vitro. Synthetic naïve or amino-terminal biotinylated Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides were synthesized by solid phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acid chemistry, purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and structurally characterized as previously described (26Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), thioflavin-T (ThT), and thioflavin-S (ThS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Normal human brain white matter tissue was provided by Dr. Annemieke Rozemuller (Dept. of Neuropathology, Free University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The cDNA for the 18.5-kDa MBP was cloned into the adenoviral vector plasmid, pacAd5 cytomegalovirus K-NpA. After verifying its integrity in this plasmid, it was then sent to the University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core for viral packaging and propagation. The completed Ad-MBP was at a titer of ≈5.5 × 107 plaque-forming units/μl. MBP was purified from normal human white matter as described previously (27Wood D.D. Moscarello M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5121-5127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The predominant 18.5-kDa MBP exists as a family of charge isomers that differ in net charge and result from various post-translational modifications. To isolate the individual charge isomers of MBP, the brain homogenates were loaded onto a CM52 cation exchange column, and the components were eluted with a 0–0.2 m NaCl gradient. Component 8 was found in the void volume, whereas the more cationic components (C5, C4, C3, C2, and C1) eluted with an increasing salt gradient. The components were dialyzed against water, lyophilized, and stored at −80 °C. The most abundant MBP C1 component was used in all subsequent studies. The cDNA encoding the 18.5-kDa isoform of human MBP was amplified by PCR using forward (5′-GGAATTCCATGGCGTCACAGAAGAGACC-3′) and reverse (5′-GACTAGTCTCAGCGTCTAGCCATGGG-3′) oligonucleotide primers. The 516-bp fragment generated was subcloned into the vector pPROEXHT (Invitrogen). This clone allowed production of recombinant human MBP with an amino-terminal His6 tag (6×-hisMBP). To produce a MBP amino-terminal fragment (MBP1) containing amino acid methionine 1 to phenylalanine 64), the 192-bp fragment was generated by PCR and subcloned into the vector pPROEXHT. The integrity of the MBP1–64 fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Following transformation into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen), 5-ml cultures were grown in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C for overnight and then used to inoculate 1-liter cultures for larger scale production. Expression was induced at A600 nm = 0.5 by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.5 mm, and then growth was allowed to proceed for an additional 3 h. For recombinant MBP protein purification, the bacterial lysate was redissolved in 20 ml of a buffer containing 6 m urea, 5 mm imidazol, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, by stirring for 16 h at 4 °C. This material was centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 30 min and then applied to a column containing 1 ml of HisBind resin (Invitrogen). The proteins that were nonspecifically bound were removed by washing with 10 ml of lysate buffer and lysate buffer containing 20 mm imidazole sequentially. Bound recombinant hisMBP proteins were eluted with 1 m imidazole in lysate buffer. The 6×-hisMBP-containing fractions were then dialyzed against with buffer of 6 m urea and 80 mm glycine, pH 10.5 or 9, for full-length MBP or MBP1, respectively, loaded onto a Whatman CM52 column, and eluted with 80 mm glycine buffer, pH 10.5, containing 200 mm NaCl. Protein refolding was achieved by removal of denaturant and salt by slow dialysis into distilled water. Samples containing MBP or Aβ were added directly into SDS-PAGE sample buffer and stored at −70 °C. The aliquots were loaded onto 12% or 10–20% polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed, and transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) at 100 V for 1.5 h at room temperature. The membranes were blocked in 5% milk, PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were added (mAb22 for MBP; Serotec, Raleigh, NC; mAb20.1 for Aβ) for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times for 5 min with PBS-T. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibodies were then added to the membranes (1:5000; Amersham Biosciences), which were then washed three times for 5 min with PBS-T. The bands were visualized using the ECL detection method (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation of MBP or Aβ bands was performed using a VersaDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad) and the manufacturer's Quantity Oneton software. Aβ peptides were initially prepared in hexafluoroisopropanol, dried, and resuspended in Me2SO to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. 1 μm Aβ40 or Aβ42 was incubated in the absence of presence of 250 nm of purified MBP, hisMBP, or hisMBP1 in PBS buffer with 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 24 h. The Aβ samples were then analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting as described above. Cos-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-products, Woodland, CA) in 24-well tissue culture plates. Triplicate nearly confluent cultures were infected with Ad-MBP (multiplicity of infection, 250), followed by the addition of 2 μg/ml of amino-terminal biotinylated Aβ40 or Aβ42 in serum-free medium for 48 h. The culture media samples were collected, and the cell lysates were prepared. The level in biotinylated Aβ peptides in the cell culture media or cell lysate samples was quantitatively analyzed by immunoblotting using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. The cell culture lysates were analyzed for MBP expression by immunoblotting as described above. To prepare amyloid fibrils, 5 mm Aβ42 in Me2SO was diluted in PBS to 100 μm, vortexed for 30 s, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 days (28Yan P. Hu X. Song H. Yin K. Bateman R.J. Cirrito J.R. Xiao Q.

Triplicate samples of 10 μm of aged fibrillar Aβ were incubated with purified MBP in PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 48 h. After digestion, the remaining fibrillar Aβ was quantified using a ThT fluorescence assay. Briefly, 5 μl of 100 μm ThT was added to 100 μl of sample, mixed, and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10 min. ThT fluorescence was measured at λex of 446 nm and λem of 490 nm. Loss of ThT fluorescence corresponded to a loss of amyloid fibrils. Alternatively, FITC-labeled fibrillar amyloid was prepared by mixing unlabeled Aβ42 and FITC-labeled Aβ42 (9:1 ratio) to 100 μm in PBS, vortexed for 30 s, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 days. Triplicate samples of 10 μm FITC-labeled fibrillar Aβ were incubated with purified MBP in PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 48 h. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatants were removed, and the pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of PBS. Fluorescence in the pellet, corresponding to remaining fibrillar Aβ, was measured at λex of 480 nm and λem of 515 nm. Sample mixtures were deposited onto carbon-coated copper mesh grids and negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. The samples were viewed with a FEI Tecnai 12 BioTwin transmission electron microscope, and digital images were taken with an Advanced Microscopy Techniques camera. Purified soluble MBP or aged fibrillar Aβ42 (10 μm) were incubated in the absence or presence of purified MBP in PBS at 37 °C for 5 days. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were removed and dried in a rotary evaporator (Savant, Farmingdale NY), suspended in 20 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, ZipTipped using μC18 tips (Millipore, Milford, MA), and then eluted to the target. The addition of 1 μl of matrix consisting of acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing ∝-cyano-4-hydroxy cinammic acid (5 mg/ml) was dried on the sample plate. The samples were run on a Voyager-DE STR (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer system operated in the reflector mode unless otherwise indicated. The mass scale (m/z 500–5000) was calibrated with a mixture of peptides or internal calibration was performed using a matrix ion at m/z 568.1330 and Aβ42 peptide amino acid 1–13 m/z 1561.6672. For samples acquired in the linear mode, 1 μl was dissolved in 10 μl of a 50% solution of acetonitrile, 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid containing sinapinic acid (10 mg/ml) and dried on the sample plate. The mass scale (m/z 1000–25000) was calibrated with myoglobin (400 fmol/μl). For this analysis the well characterized Tg2576 (APPsw) mouse model of AD that develops abundant fibrillar amyloid pathology (29Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3635) Google Scholar) was used. Brains were removed from anesthetized 18-month-old Tg2576 mice after perfusion with cold saline and snap-frozen on dry ice. Five-μm cryostat sections were collected on slides. Every other section was flipped 180° so that identical faces of adjacent sections were exposed (28Yan P. Hu X. Song H. Yin K. Bateman R.J. Cirrito J.R. Xiao Q. Hsu F.F. Turk J.W. Xu J. Hsu C.Y. Holtzman D.M. Lee J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24566-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Paired adjacent sections (one incubated with PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the other incubated with 5 μm purified MBP in absence or presence of 1 mm PMSF) in triplicate were incubated at 37 °C for 2 days, stained with thioflavin-S, and then imaged with fluorescence microscopy. The parenchymal plaque amyloid or vascular amyloid area of ThS fluorescence was determined using image analysis software (Image J). The fractional area was compared between paired sections. The data were analyzed by Student's t test at the 0.05 significance level. Recently, purified MBP was reported to possess serine proteinase autolytic activity (22D'Souza C.A. Wood D.D. She Y.M. Moscarello M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12905-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To confirm this finding, MBP was purified from normal human white matter as described under “Materials and Methods.” For the most abundant MBP C1 component, a high degree of purity was obtained yielding a single protein species of ≈18.5 kDa as detected by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 1A) and by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1B). To confirm the previously reported serine proteinase autolytic activity, purified human MBP was incubated at 37 °C in the absence or presence of the serine proteinase inhibitors PMSF for 72 h, and aliquots were removed and analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-MBP antibody mAB22. As shown in Fig. 1C, MBP exhibited autolysis, which was completely inhibited by treatment with PMSF. These experiments confirmed that purified human brain MBP exhibits serine proteinase autolytic activity. Other purified MBP isoforms, C2 and C3, also exhibited autolytic activity as shown for C1 (data not shown). The MBP C1 isoform was used in all of the subsequent experiments. We have recently shown that MBP strongly binds Aβ peptides and inhibits Aβ fibril formation (24Hoos M.D. Ahmed M. Smith S.O. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9952-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In light of the endogenous proteinase activity of MBP, we sought to determine whether it could proteolytically degrade Aβ peptides in vitro. Quantitative immunoblotting analysis presented in Fig. 2 shows that incubation with purified MBP resulted in degradation of soluble synthetic Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides. One nm MBP degraded ≈2 nm Aβ40 and ≈3 nm Aβ42 per hour. Although the rate of Aβ hydrolysis was relatively slow, Aβ42 was degraded faster than Aβ40 in the same time period. The serine 151 in MBP was reported to be the active site serine involved in its autolysis (22D'Souza C.A. Wood D.D. She Y.M. Moscarello M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12905-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To test whether serine 151 is the active site involved in autolysis as well as in the Aβ degradation, we produced recombinant wild type and S151A mutant human 6×-hisMBP. The purified recombinant 6×-hisMBP wild type (hisMBP) exhibited similar autolysis and Aβ degrading activity as purified human brain MBP (Fig. 3). However, recombinant 6×-hisMBP-S151A showed similar autolysis and Aβ degrading activity (data not shown), suggesting that this is not the proteolytic active site. To further define the proteolytic activity of MBP, we prepared and purified a recombinant amino-terminal fragment of MBP containing residues 1–64 (hisMBP1). Recent work in our laboratory demonstrated that this region harbors the Aβ binding domain on MBP. 4M. D. Hoos and W. E. Van Nostrand, unpublished data. However, this fragment possesses neither endogenous proteinase activity nor Aβ degrading activity (Fig. 3). We next determined whether MBP expressed in a cell-based system could degrade soluble Aβ peptides. To do this, we used an adenoviral vector (Ad-MBP) to express MBP in Cos-1 cells, a cell type that does not normally express MBP protein. Immunoblotting confirmed that Cos-1 cells infected with Ad-MBP express MBP, whereas uninfected and adenovirus with green fluorescent protein-infected Cos-1 cells showed no MBP expression (Fig. 4A, top panel). To analyze exogenous Aβ degradation in this system, we used amino-terminally biotinylated Aβ peptides to increase the detection sensitivity. Post infection, 2 μg/ml of soluble biotinylated Aβ40 or Aβ42 was added into the culture media and then incubated for 48 h. Detection of Aβ peptides in the culture media samples using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase showed that MBP expression in Cos-1 cells resulted in the loss of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Fig. 4A, middle and bottom panels, respectively). Quantitation of biotinylated Aβ40 or Aβ42 levels in the culture media of Ad-MBP infected cells showed that they were significantly decreased compared with uninfected or adenovirus with green fluorescent protein infected Cos-1 cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Essentially the same results were obtained using unlabeled Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides that were detected by quantitative immunoblotting or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). Finally, quantitation of cell-associated biotinylated Aβ showed no difference in the levels of biotinylated Aβ40 or Aβ42 with the Cos-1 cells under any condition (Fig. 4, D–F). Together, these results suggest that MBP expressed in Cos-1 cells can promote Aβ degradation. We next determined whether MBP could degrade fibrillar Aβ. As a first approach, 10 μm of aged fibrillar Aβ42 was incubated with or without 1 μm purified MBP at 37 °C for 48 h, and the remaining fibrillar Aβ was measured using the ThT fluorescence binding assay. A shown in Fig. 5A, the remaining ThT fluorescence signal was decreased by nearly 50% in the presence of purified MBP. As an alternative approach, fibrillar Aβ was prepared by aging FITC-labeled Aβ42 with unlabeled Aβ42 (at a 1:9 molar ratio) and then incubated with or without 1 μm purified MBP at 37 °C for 48 h. The remaining amyloid fibrils were collected by centrifugation and measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. Similar to the ThT fluorescence binding assay, when incubated with purified MBP fibrillar Aβ decreased by nearly 50% (Fig. 5B). Finally, fibrillar Aβ was incubated with or without purified MBP for 48 h, and then transmission electron microscopy was performed to visualize the remaining fibrillar Aβ at the ultrastructural level. Incubation with purified MBP markedly reduced the extent of fibrillar Aβ (Fig. 5C). Together, these data strongly suggest that MBP can degrade fibrillar Aβ. Fibrillar Aβ42 was digested with purified MBP to determine specific cleavage products. Aβ fragments were isolated and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Nine specific Aβ degradation fragments (Fig. 6C) were observed that were not present in the supernatant of the postincubation fibrillar Aβ preparation alone (Fig. 6A). Similarly, these nine specific Aβ fragments were not present in the postincubation of purified MBP alone, although MBP-specific fragments were observed resulting from MBP autolysis (Fig. 6B). Fig. 6D shows the multiple cleavage sites on fibrillar Aβ for digestion with MBP. We also determined soluble Aβ42 degradation products by MBP and analyzed by MALDI-TOF. For soluble Aβ42, four of the same specific fibrillar Aβ42 degradation peaks were observed; however, the signals obtained were much lower (data not shown). The above data showed that purified MBP was capable of degrading soluble and fibrillar synthetic Aβ peptides in vitro. We next determined whether purified MBP could degrade actual amyloid deposits that form in the brains of APP transgenic mice. To do this, adjacent brain slices of aged Tg2576 mice were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h with buffer alone or purified MBP treated with PMSF or left untreated. After incubation the sections were stained with ThS, and the area of fluorescence between matching plaques or vascular amyloid deposits from adjacent sections was measured. The area of ThS fluorescence of adjacent brain sections did not show a difference when incubated with buffer alone, whereas the area of parenchymal and cerebral vascular amyloid deposits was significantly decreased in the brain sections incubated with purified MBP (Figs. 7 and 8, respectively). However, the fibrillar amyloid degradation by purified human MBP was completely inhibited by pretreatment with PMSF. These results demonstrate that purified MBP is capable of degrading fibrillar amyloid deposits in brain and that serine proteinase activity of MBP was involved.FIGURE 8In situ degradation of cerebral vascular fibrillar Aβ deposits by purified MBP. A–F, adjacent 5-μm fresh frozen brain sections from 18-month-old Tg2576 mice were incubated alone (A–C and E) or with purified MBP (D) or PMSF-treated MBP (F) at 37 °C for 2 days. The sections were then fixed and stained with ThS. Scale bars, 50 μm. G, the parallel cerebral vascular fibrillar amyloid deposit areas were quantified in the treated (gray bars) and untreated (black bars) sections and expressed as percentages of remaining ThS area. The data presented are the means ± S.D. of n = 16 vascular deposits (buffer alone), n = 18 vascular deposits (incubated with MBP), and n = 15 vascular deposits (incubated with PMSF-treated MBP) (*, p < 0.001, paired t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the present study, we have identified a novel function of purified MBP as an Aβ peptide degrading enzyme in vitro. First, we confirmed that highly purified MBP from normal human white matter or purified recombinant 6×-hisMBP exhibit serine proteinase autolytic activity. Subsequent experiments revealed that both soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides were degraded by purified MBP in vitro and in Cos-1 cells expressing MBP. Further, we demonstrated by several means that purified MBP could degrade fibrillar Aβ as well. Mass spectrometry analysis identified multiple MBP cleavage sites on soluble and fibrillar Aβ. Lastly, we showed that purified human MBP could degrade parenchymal and fibrillar amyloid deposits in brain tissue sections of APP transgenic mice. Several lines of evidence argue against the possibility of a contaminating proteinase activity in our purified MBP preparations. First, we purified MBP from normal human white matter with a very high degree of purity as assessed by mass spectrometry and by the observation of a single protein band by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis using SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 1, A and B). Second, MBP purified from a variety of highly diverse sources including human and mouse brain tissues, Ad-MBP-infected Cos-1 cells, and recombinant expression in E. coli all exhibited similar autolytic and Aβ degrading activity. Lastly, the purified recombinant 6×-hisMBP amino-terminal fragment exhibited a loss in autolysis and Aβ degrading activity. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that contamination of purified MBP with another Aβ-degrading enzyme is highly unlikely. Serine residue 151 of MBP was previously reported as the active site serine for its proteinase activity (22D'Souza C.A. Wood D.D. She Y.M. Moscarello M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12905-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, a purified 6×-hisMBP-S151A mutant still exhibited autolysis and Aβ degrading activity (data not shown). This indicates that Ser151 is likely not the proteolytic active site. Further work is needed to determine the precise proteolytic active site of MBP autolytic and Aβ degrading activity. Compared with other known Aβ-degrading enzymes such as insulin-degrading enzyme, neprilysin, endothelin-converting enzyme, and plasmin, the Aβ degrading activity of MBP in vitro appears to be quite modest. For example, it was reported that 25 μm Aβ40 was degraded by 50 nm plasmin within 4 h (30Van Nostrand W.E. Porter M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11570-11576Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In comparison, we observed that 250 nm MBP could degrade 1 μm Aβ40 or Aβ42 in 24 h (Fig. 2). Perhaps the conditions used in our in vitro Aβ degradation assays do not reflect the optimum environment for MBP to exert its proteolytic activity. MBP is one of the major components of CNS myelin produced by oligodendrocytes in brain (31Omlin F.X. Webster H.D. Palkovits C.G. Cohen S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although the total amount of MBP in brain is orders of magnitude higher than other Aβ-degrading enzymes, whether MBP exhibits Aβ degrading activity as a component of myelin is presently unknown. However, when demyelination occurs, as in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions, this opportunity may release soluble MBP that is capable of degrading Aβ. Fibrillar Aβ in plaques and vascular deposits is highly resistant to proteolysis because of its inherent structural nature and modifications that occur such as oxidation and cross-linking (32Atwood C.S. Martins R.N. Smith M.A. Perry G. Peptides. 2002; 23: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Many Aβ-degrading enzymes such as endothelin-converting enzyme, insulin-degrading enzyme, and neprilysin exhibit little or no degradative activity toward fibrillar Aβ. In contrast, plasmin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 have been shown to degrade Aβ fibrils in vitro and amyloid plaques in situ (28Yan P. Hu X. Song H. Yin K. Bateman R.J. Cirrito J.R. Xiao Q. Hsu F.F. Turk J.W. Xu J. Hsu C.Y. Holtzman D.M. Lee J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24566-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Likewise, we demonstrate that purified MBP also exhibits fibrillar Aβ degradative activity and in situ plaque degradation. Moreover, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis identified numerous fibrillar Aβ degradation fragments generated by purified MBP consistent with other known Aβ-degrading enzymes that exhibit multiple cleavage sites on Aβ. MBP is the main structural protein of the myelin sheath and is associated with myelin membrane through interaction between the positive Arg and Lys residues and the negatively charged phosphate groups of the membrane phospholipids (33Cheifetz S. Moscarello M.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1909-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It was reported that MBP still undergoes autolysis in the presence of lipid (22D'Souza C.A. Wood D.D. She Y.M. Moscarello M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12905-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here we show that MBP expressed in Cos-1 cells could still degrade Aβ40 and Aβ42. Together, these findings suggest that MBP still retains its proteolytic activity in association with lipids or cell membranes, although the detailed enzymatic activity of MBP in vivo needs to be further investigated. AD is largely considered as a disease of the brain gray matter (34Stout J.C. Jernigan T.L. Archibald S.L. Salmon D.P. Arch. Neurol. 1996; 53: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, widespread and diffuse myelin breakdown has been reported in AD patients, and white matter deficits are observed in the early stage of the disease (23Bartzokis G. Cummings J.L. Sultzer D. Henderson V.W. Nuechterlein K.H. Mintz J. Arch. Neurol. 2003; 60: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). It has been reported that MBP levels were significantly decreased in the white matter of AD patients (36Roher A.E. Weiss N. Kokjohn T.A. Kuo Y.M. Kalback W. Anthony J. Watson D. Luehrs D.C. Sue L. Walker D. Emmerling M. Goux W. Beach T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11080-11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 37Wang D.S. Bennett D.A. Mufson E.J. Mattila P. Cochran E. Dickson D.W. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 48: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were increased in the AD white matter exhibiting decreased levels of MBP (36Roher A.E. Weiss N. Kokjohn T.A. Kuo Y.M. Kalback W. Anthony J. Watson D. Luehrs D.C. Sue L. Walker D. Emmerling M. Goux W. Beach T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11080-11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and Aβ deposits were also observed (38Wisniewski H.M. Bancher C. Barcikowska M. Wen G.Y. Currie J. Acta Neuropathol. 1989; 78: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Our present results that demonstrate the Aβ degrading activity of purified MBP, coupled with our recent reports that MBP can potently inhibit the fibrillar assembly of Aβ peptides (24Hoos M.D. Ahmed M. Smith S.O. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9952-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Hoos M.D. Ahmed M. Smith S.O. Van Nostrand W.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), are consistent with these findings. It has also been proposed that MBP could counteract the surface structure of Aβ fibril-mediated cytotoxicity (35Yoshiike Y. Akagi T. Takashima A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9805-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In any case, future in vivo studies are warranted to further understand the potential multiple functions of MBP in inhibition of Aβ fibril assembly, Aβ degradation, and modulation of Aβ mediated cytotoxicity that may play a role in the pathogenesis of amyloid deposition."
https://openalex.org/W2053294422,"Background There is a need for drug delivery systems (DDS) that can enhance cytosolic delivery of anti-cancer drugs trapped in the endo-lysosomal compartments. Exposure of cells to specific photosensitizers followed by light exposure (photochemical internalization, PCI) results in transfer of agents from the endocytic compartment into the cytosol. Methodology and Principal Findings The recombinant single-chain fusion construct scFvMEL/rGel is composed of an antibody targeting the progenitor marker HMW-MAA/NG2/MGP/gp240 and the highly effective toxin gelonin (rGel). Here we demonstrate enhanced tumor cell selectivity, cytosolic delivery and anti-tumor activity by applying PCI of scFvMEL/rGel. PCI performed by light activation of cells co-incubated with scFvMEL/rGel and the endo-lysosomal targeting photosensitizers AlPcS2a or TPPS2a resulted in enhanced cytotoxic effects against antigen-positive cell lines, while no differences in cytotoxicity between the scFvMEL/rGel and rGel were observed in antigen-negative cells. Mice bearing well-developed melanoma (A-375) xenografts (50–100 mm3) were treated with PCI of scFvMEL/rGel. By 30 days after injection, ∼100% of mice in the control groups had tumors>800 mm3. In contrast, by day 40, 50% of mice in the PCI of scFvMEL/rGel combination group had tumors<800 mm3 with no increase in tumor size up to 110 days. PCI of scFvMEL/rGel resulted in a synergistic effect (p<0.05) and complete regression (CR) in 33% of tumor-bearing mice (n = 12). Conclusions/Significance This is a unique demonstration that a non-invasive multi-modality approach combining a recombinant, targeted therapeutic such as scFvMEL/rGel and PCI act in concert to provide potent in vivo efficacy without sacrificing selectivity or enhancing toxicity. The present DDS warrants further evaluation of its clinical potential."
https://openalex.org/W2046031309,"ADP-ribosylation is one of the favored modes of cell intoxication employed by several bacteria. Clostridium difficile is recognized to be an important nosocomial pathogen associated with considerable morbidity and attributable mortality. Along with its two well known toxins, Toxin A and Toxin B, it produces an ADP-ribosylating toxin that targets monomeric actin of the target cell. Like other Clostridial actin ADP-ribosylating toxins, this binary toxin, known as C. difficile toxin (CDT), is composed of two subunits, CDTa and CDTb. In this study, we present high resolution crystal structures of CDTa in its native form (at pH 4.0, 8.5, and 9.0) and in complex with ADP-ribose donors, NAD and NADPH (at pH 9.0). The crystal structures of the native protein show ""pronounced conformational flexibility"" confined to the active site region of the protein and ""enhanced"" disorder at low pH, whereas the complex structures highlight significant differences in ""ligand specificity"" compared with the enzymatic subunit of a close homologue, Clostridium perfringens iota toxin. Specifically in CDTa, two of the suggested catalytically important residues (Glu-385 and Glu-387) seem to play no role or a less important role in ligand binding. These structural data provide the first detailed information on protein-donor substrate complex stabilization in CDTa, which may have implications in understanding CDT recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2002096607,"4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a major racemic product of lipid peroxidation, preferentially reacts with cysteine residues to form a stable HNE-cysteine Michael addition adduct possessing three chiral centers. Here, to gain more insight into sulfhydryl modification by HNE, we characterized the stereochemical configuration of the HNE-cysteine adducts and investigated their stereoselective formation in redox-regulated proteins. To characterize the HNE-cysteine adducts by NMR, the authentic (R)-HNE- and (S)-HNE-cysteine adducts were prepared by incubating N-acetylcysteine with each HNE enantiomer, both of which provided two peaks in reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The NMR analysis revealed that each peak was a mixture of anomeric isomers. In addition, mutarotation at the anomeric center was also observed in the analysis of the nuclear Overhauser effect. To analyze these adducts in proteins, we adapted a pyridylamination-based approach, using 2-aminopyridine in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride, which enabled analyzing the individual (R)-HNE- and (S)-HNE-cysteine adducts by reversed-phase HPLC following acid hydrolysis. Using the pyridylamination method along with mass spectrometry, we characterized the stereoselective formation of the HNE-cysteine adducts in human thioredoxin and found that HNE preferentially modifies Cys73 and, to the lesser extent, the active site Cys32. More interestingly, the (R)-HNE- and (S)-HNE-cysteine adducts were almost equally formed at Cys73, whereas Cys32 exhibited a remarkable preference for the adduct formation with (R)-HNE. Finally, the utility of the method for the determination of the HNE-cysteine adducts was confirmed by an in vitro study using HeLa cells. The present results not only offer structural insight into sulfhydryl modification by lipid peroxidation products but also provide a platform for the chemical analysis of protein S-associated aldehydes in vitro and in vivo. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a major racemic product of lipid peroxidation, preferentially reacts with cysteine residues to form a stable HNE-cysteine Michael addition adduct possessing three chiral centers.

The present results not only offer structural insight into sulfhydryl modification by lipid peroxidation products but also provide a platform for the chemical analysis of protein S-associated aldehydes in vitro and in vivo. Lipid peroxidation in tissue and in tissue fractions represents a degradative process, which is the consequence of the production and the propagation of free radical reactions primarily involving membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as in drug-associated toxicity, post-ischemic reoxygenation injury, and aging (1Gutteridge J.M. Halliwell B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). The peroxidative breakdown of polyunsaturated fatty acids has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of many types of liver injury and especially in the hepatic damage induced by several toxic substances. Lipid peroxidation leads to the formation of a broad array of different products with diverse and powerful biological activities. Among them is a variety of different aldehydes (2Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5903) Google Scholar). The primary products of lipid peroxidation, lipid hydroperoxides, can undergo carbon-carbon bond cleavage via alkoxyl radicals in the presence of transition metals giving rise to the formation of short chain, unesterified aldehydes, or a second class of aldehydes still esterified to the parent lipid. These reactive aldehydic intermediates readily form covalent adducts with cellular macromolecules, including protein, leading to disruption of important cellular functions. The important agents that give rise to the modification of protein may be represented by α,β-unsaturated aldehydic intermediates, such as 2-alkenals, 4-hydroxy-2-alkenals, and 4-oxo-2-alkenals (3Uchida K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1685-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 4Marnett L.J. Riggins J.N. West J.D. J. Clin.

Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5903) Google Scholar, 5Uchida K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 318-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). HNE exerts these effects because of its facile reactivity with biological materials, particularly the sulfhydryl groups of proteins. The reaction of HNE with sulfhydryl groups leads to the formation of thioether adducts that further undergo cyclization to form cyclic hemiacetals (2Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5903) Google Scholar). Although HNE also forms Michael adducts with the imidazole moiety of histidine residues and the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues (5Uchida K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 318-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), the formation of thiol-derived Michael adducts, stabilized as the cyclic hemiacetal, is considered to constitute the main reactivity of HNE, because of the nucleophilic potential of the sulfhydryl group compared with those of the imidazole and amine groups. However, because of the lack of specific and reliable methods for the determination of HNE-cysteine adducts, no study has so far quantitatively demonstrated their formation in proteins. 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal 2-aminopyridine correlation spectroscopy 1H-detected multiple-bond connectivity matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry nuclear Overhauser effect nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy sodium cyanoborohydride thioredoxin high pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry phosphate-buffered saline 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. Because HNE generated in lipid peroxidation is a racemic mixture of 4R- and 4S-enantiomers (6Schneider C. Tallman K.A. Porter N.A. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20831-20838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), the HNE Michael adducts, possessing three chiral centers at C-2, C-4, and C-5 in the tetrahydrofuran moiety (Fig. 1A), are composed of at least eight isomers. In our previous study (7Hashimoto M. Sibata T. Wasada H. Toyokuni S. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5044-5051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we characterized the configurational isomers of an HNE-histidine adduct by NMR spectroscopy and by molecular orbital calculations, and we found that the configuration of the tetrahydrofuran ring could affect the electron delocalization features, which contribute to the stability of the adduct. Moreover, we raised monoclonal antibodies against (R)-HNE- and (S)-HNE-histidine adducts and observed differential cellular distributions of these adducts in vivo. Balogh et al. (8Balogh L.M. Roberts A.G. Shireman L.M. Greene R.J. Atkins W.M. J. Biol.

Despite these studies, however, the stereoselectivity of the HNE Michael addition adducts generated in proteins remains to be fully explored. In this study, to gain further structural insight into sulfhydryl modification by the lipid peroxidation product, we characterized the stereochemical configuration of the HNE-N-acetylcysteine adducts by NMR spectroscopy. In addition, we adapted a pyridylamination-based method for fluorescent labeling of the HNE-cysteine adducts, using 2-aminopyridine (2-AP) and sodium cyanoborohydride (NaCNBH3), and successfully analyzed the individual (R)-HNE- and (S)-HNE-cysteine adducts by reversed-phase HPLC following acid hydrolysis. Furthermore, using the pyridylamination method along with mass spectrometry, we characterized the stereoselective formation of the HNE-cysteine adducts in human thioredoxin (Trx). N-Acetyl-l-cysteine was obtained from Sigma. Human recombinant Trx was produced by a method described previously (9Tagaya Y. Maeda Y. Mitsui A. Kondo N. Matsui H. Hamuro J. Brown N. Arai K. Yokota T. Wakasugi H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Thiol determination of Trx using 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid gave 4.5 sulfhydryl residues per Trx protein (mol/mol) (data not shown). Sequence grade-modified trypsin was obtained from Promega. 2-AP, bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free), dithiothreitol, and iodoacetamide were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. The stock solutions of HNE were prepared by the acid treatment (1 mm HCl) of HNE dimethylacetal, which was synthesized according to the procedure of De Montarby et al. (10De Montarby L. Mosset P. Gree R. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 3895Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Enantioisomeric HNEs, (R)-HNE and (S)-HNE, were prepared by the enzymatic resolution of racemic HNE (11Allevi P. Anastasia M. Cajone F. Ciuffreda P. Sanvito A.M. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 5000-5002Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and purified by chiral phase HPLC on a ChiralPak AS column (0.46 × 25 cm) (Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) eluted with hexane/2-propanol/trifluoroacetic acid (90:10:0.01, by volume), at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by UV absorbance at 224 nm. The concentrations of racemic and enantioisomeric HNE stock solutions were determined by the measurement of UV absorbance at 224 nm (12Schauenstein E. Taufer M. Esterbauer H. Kylianek A. Seelich T. Monatsh. Chem. 1971; 102: 517-529Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (10 ml) containing 40 mm N-acetylcysteine was incubated with 20 mm (R,S)-HNE, (R)-HNE, or (S)-HNE in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were analyzed with reverse phase HPLC on a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm inner diameter) (Nomura Chemicals, Aichi, Japan) eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (90:10:0.01, by volume) (solvent A), acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (100:0.01, by volume) (solvent B) (time = 0–5 min, 100% A; 60 min, 0% A), at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 200–400 nm. NMR spectra were obtained by an AMX2-600 (600 MHz for 1H) spectrometer (Bruker, Tsukuba). Chemical shifts (δ) of 1H NMR are given in parts per million (ppm) relative to the internal standard peak at δ 3.75 (dioxane) for D2O solutions. Coupling constants (J) are in Hz. Chemical shifts (δ) of 13C NMR are given in ppm relative to the internal standard peak at δ 69.3 (dioxane) for D2O solutions. The HNE-N-acetylcysteine adducts (1 mm) were treated with 340 mm 2-AP and 90 mm NaCNBH3 for 24 h at 37 °C. The pyridylaminated HNE-N-acetylcysteine adducts were hydrolyzed in vacuo with 6 n HCl for 24 h at 110 °C. The hydrolysates were then concentrated, dissolved in distilled water, and then analyzed by reverse phase HPLC on a Sunniest C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm inner diameter, ChromaNik, Japan). The samples were eluted with a gradient of water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B), (time = 0–40 min, 95 to 60% A; 40–45 min, 60 to 0% A), at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 230 nm and by fluorescence intensity (excitation, 315 nm; emission, 380 nm). Trx (1 mg/ml) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) was incubated with 1 mm HNE for 5–30 min at 37 °C. The mixture was then applied to a PD-10 column (Sephadex G-25), equilibrated in PBS, to separate protein-bound HNE from the free aldehyde. For determination of the HNE-cysteine adducts by the pyridylamination method, the reactions were terminated by incubating with 340 mm 2-AP and 16 mm NaCNBH3 for 24 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, they were extensively dialyzed against PBS to remove a large amount of the free probe. The pyridylaminated samples were hydrolyzed in vacuo with 6 n HCl for 24 h at 110 °C. The hydrolysates were concentrated, dissolved in distilled water, and then analyzed by HPLC for the pyridylaminated HNE-cysteine adducts. The pyridylaminated protein samples (1 mg/ml) were reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0) for 30 min at 56 °C and then carbamidomethylated with 50 mm iodoacetamide in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide were removed by centrifugal filtration using YM-3 microcon centrifugal filter devices. The protein samples were digested with modified trypsin in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.8) at 37 °C for 18 h using an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w). Peptide samples were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC on a Sunniest C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm inner diameter, ChromaNik, Japan). The samples were eluted with a gradient of water containing 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile containing 0.08% formic acid (solvent B), (time = 0–3 min, 90% A isocratic; 3–40 min, 90 to 60% A; 40–50 min, 60 to 50% A; 50–60 min, 50 to 20% A; 60–70 min, 20 to 0% A) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 215 nm and by fluorescence intensity (Ex., 315 nm; Em., 380 nm). The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and MALDI-MS/MS were acquired using an Applied Biosystems 4700 proteomics analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with time-of-flight/time-of-flight (TOF/TOF) ion optics; α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) was used as the matrix. The (R)-HNE, (S)-HNE, and HNE-cysteine Michael adduct molecules were generated and energy-minimized using the Dundee PRODRG Server (13Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4291) Google Scholar). The positions of the (R)-HNE, (S)-HNE, and HNE-cysteine Michael adduct were adjusted using Coot (14Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar) and MolFeat (FiatLux Co., Japan) to avoid steric clash and to correct the direction of C-3 toward its target thiol group of Cys32. The surface electric potential was calculated from the coordinate of the human Trx structure (Protein Data Bank code 1ERW, reduced-form human Trx) using the program MolFeat. HeLa cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in an incubator with 95% humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The Trx activity was measured by the insulin reduction assay (15Sasada T. Nakamura H. Ueda S. Sato N. Kitaoka Y. Gon Y. Takabayashi A. Spyrou G. Holmgren A. Yodoi J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To analyze the HNE-cysteine adducts, the HeLa cells were treated with 0–50 μm HNE for 30 min. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, lysed in lysis buffer (4% (w/v) CHAPS, 9 m urea, 40 mm Tris (base), and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C; the supernatant was pyridylaminated, and the HNE-cysteine adducts were determined by HPLC analysis following acid hydrolysis. For determination of HNE-cysteine adducts using the pyridylamination method in combination with SDS-PAGE, total cell lysates from the HNE-treated HeLa cells were pyridylaminated and separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein bands from Coomassie-stained gels were then selected, excised manually, and treated in vacuo with 6 n HCl for 24 h at 110 °C to hydrolyze proteins in gels. The hydrolysates were concentrated, dissolved in distilled water, and analyzed by HPLC for the pyridylaminated HNE-cysteine adducts. Because of the introduction of new chiral centers at C-2, C-4, and C-5 during the reaction, the HNE-cysteine adducts are composed of at least eight configurational isomers (Fig. 1A). To prepare individual (R)-HNE- and (S)-HNE-cysteine adducts, N-acetylcysteine was incubated with (R)- and (S)-HNE enantiomers, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1B, the reversed-phase HPLC demonstrated that the reaction of N-acetylcysteine with (R)-HNE in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h at 37 °C mainly gave two products, R1 and R2, with relative amounts of 1:1. A similar HPLC profile was observed in the reaction of N-acetylcysteine with (S)-HNE, providing S1 and S2. The liquid chromatography-MS analysis of these peaks gave a pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 320 (M + H)+ (data not shown), which could be expected from the Michael addition-type HNE-cysteine adducts, suggesting that they all represent the products derived from the Michael addition of the sulfhydryl group to the C-3 of HNE. To characterize the stereochemical configurations of HNE-N-acetylcysteine adducts, the four products (R1, R2, S1, and S2) obtained from the reaction of N-acetylcysteine with HNE enantiomers were analyzed by 600 MHz NMR. The assignment of the proton signals and stereochemistry could be done by analyzing 1H-1H-correlation spectroscopy (COSY), 1H-detected multiple-bond connectivity, 1H-detected multiple quantum coherence, and the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum recorded in D2O. The COSY spectrum of S1 suggested that the peak was a mixture of anomeric isomers (Fig. 2). Similarly, other products (R1, R2, and S2) also appeared to contain a pair of anomeric isomers (supplemental Tables SI and SII). Identification of the proton signals of the tetrahydrofuran moiety in R1, R2, S1, and S2 follows from the analysis of the NOESY spectra collected in D2O. In S1, the proton signals at 4.31 and 4.10 ppm, which were assigned to the methine protons at C-5, displayed NOE cross-peaks to the methine proton at C-4, although there were weaker NOE cross-peaks in S2 (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that the configurations at C-4 of S1 and S2 are S and R, respectively. The absolute configurations at C-2 and C-3 were determined by the NOE connectivity between the C-2 methine proton and C-3 methylene protons (H-3a and H-3b). These data suggest that S1 is a mixture of 2R,4S,5S and 2S,4S,5S anomeric isomers, and S2 is a mixture of 2S,4R,5S and 2R,4R,5S anomeric isomers. Based on the assignment of these signals, the relative amounts (%) of 2R,4S,5S, 2S,4S,5S, 2S,4R,5S, and 2R,4R,5S anomeric isomers in D2O were found to be 1, 5, 3, and 3, respectively. In a manner similar to the assignment of the (S)-HNE-cysteine adducts, R1 and R2 were determined to be a mixture of 2S,4R,5R and 2R,4R,5R anomeric isomers and a mixture of 2R,4S,5R and 2S,4S,5R anomeric isomers, respectively. In addition, the relative amounts (%) of the (R)-HNE-cysteine configurational isomers (2S,4R,5R/2R,4R,5R/2R,4S,5R/2S,4S,5R = 1:5:3:3) were exactly comparable with those of the (S)-HNE-cysteine isomers. Fig. 3 summarizes the configurations of R1, R2, S1, and S2 from the HNE-N-acetylcysteine adducts.FIGURE 3Chemical structures of the configurational isomers of the (R,S)-HNE-N-acetylcysteine adduct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The hemiacetal ring opens and reforms to give products with different configurations at the anomeric center. This equilibration occurs with all reducing saccharides and is accompanied by a change in optical rotation. This process of equilibrating the ratios of two anomers in carbohydrates is known as mutarotation. It can be assumed that the anomers in the four products (R1, R2, S1, and S2) also interconvert via an open chain form (reversible formation of internal hemiacetal linkage). We indeed observed the NOE cross-peaks (Fig. 4A) between the anomeric isomers (2R,4S,5S and 2S,4S,5S) in the NOESY analysis of S1. Similar cross-peaks were also observed in the NOESY analysis of three other products (R1, R2, and S2). Mutarotation of S1 in solution at equilibrium is shown in Fig. 4B. Because of the lack of a specific and reliable method for determination of the HNE-cysteine adducts, no study has so far quantitatively demonstrated their formation in the HNE-modified proteins. Hence, we attempted to establish a method for the detection of HNE-cysteine adducts. Our strategy for the fluorescent labeling of HNE-cysteine adducts in proteins is illustrated in Fig. 5. The method is based on the fact that HNE forms Michael addition adducts with specific amino acid residues possessing a cyclic hemiacetal ring, which upon reaction with 2-AP in the presence of NaCNBH3 can be converted to the pyridylaminated derivatives. It was anticipated that the HNE-cysteine adducts after the pyridylamination were resistant to the process of acid hydrolysis. To test the validity of this procedure, we first attempted to detect the adducts in the hydrolyzed samples of authentic HNE-N-acetylcysteine adduct. As shown in Fig. 6, the pyridylamination of the HNE-cysteine adduct followed by acid hydrolysis gave two products in the reverse phase HPLC analysis. Based on the observations that the pyridylamination of the authentic (R)-HNE- and (S)-HNE-cysteine adducts gave main peaks at 27 and 28 min, respectively, these products were identified to be the pyridylaminated (R)-HNE- and (S)-HNE-cysteine adducts, respectively. However, we were unable to further separate the diastereomers of the individual (R)-HNE- and (S)-HNE-cysteine adducts (data not shown).FIGURE 6HPLC analysis of pyridylaminated HNE-cysteine adducts. The purified HNE-N-acetylcysteine adducts (1 mm) were treated with 340 mm 2-AP and 90 mm NaCNBH3 for 24 h at 37 °C. The pyridylaminated HNE-cysteine adducts were analyzed by a reverse phase HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the formation of HNE-cysteine adducts in proteins, we utilized Trx, the major redox-regulated protein present in the mitochondria and cytosol (16Deneke S.M. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 151-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Trx is sensitive to HNE (17Go Y.M. Halvey P.J. Hansen J.M. Reed M. Pohl J. Jones D.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 171: 1670-1681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the redox residues (Cys32 and Cys35) in Trx represent primary targets for HNE modification (18Fang J. Holmgren A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). When Trx (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 0.5 mm HNE in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C, selective loss of cysteine was observed (supplemental Fig. S2, panel A). In addition, accompanied by the loss of cysteine residues, the enzyme activity of Trx linearly decreased to 30% of the initial value after 30 min (supplemental Fig. S2, panel B). To further examine the selective modification of the Trx cysteine residues, the HNE-treated Trx and cysteine-blocked Trx for 5 min were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. As shown in supplemental Fig. S3 (panel A), the analysis of the native Trx revealed a peak of m/z 11738. When Trx was incubated with 0.5 mm HNE in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 5 min at 37 °C, some adducted Trx subunits were observed (m/z 11,894), as well as the peak (m/z 12,050), corresponding to the addition of one to two molecules of HNE per Trx. However, the cysteine-blocked Trx (m/z 12,023, corresponding to the alkylation of five cysteine residues in Trx) was resistant to the HNE adduction (supplemental Fig. S3, panel B). These results suggest that HNE exclusively binds to the active site cysteine residues of Trx and forms adduct, most probably the Michael addition-type HNE-cysteine adducts. To characterize the formation of the HNE-cysteine adducts in Trx, the HNE-treated and untreated Trx were pyridylaminated, hydrolyzed, and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC. As shown in Fig. 7A, the incubation of Trx with 1 mm HNE for 0–30 min at 37 °C resulted in the formation of both (R)-HNE- and (S)-HNE-cysteine adducts. Of interest, Trx exhibited a preference for the adduct formation with (R)-HNE in the presence of both enantiomers. The concentrations reached about 3.0 and 1.5 molecules of the (R)-HNE- and (S)-HNE-cysteine adducts per protein molecule, respectively, after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 7B). Such stereoselective formation of HNE-cysteine adducts was not observed in other sulfhydryl proteins, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 3C. Wakita, A. Yamazaki, and K. Uchida, unpublished data. These data and the observation that, upon reaction with racemic HNE, N-acetylcysteine generated almost equal amounts of the (R)-HNE- and (S)-HNE-cysteine adducts (Fig. 6) suggested the unique stereoselectivity of Trx cysteine residues toward HNE. Based on the preferential formation of the (R)-HNE-cysteine adducts, we further characterized the stereochemistry of individual HNE-cysteine adducts generated in the HNE-modified Trx. Trx (1 mg/ml) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) was incubated with 1 mm HNE at 37 °C. To identify a hypersensitive cysteine, the incubation time was fixed to 5 min. Trx after treatment with and without HNE was pyridylaminated, carbamidomethylated, and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were then separated by reverse phase HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The peptide map demonstrated the appearance of one major fluorescent product (P-1) and several minor fluorescent products, including P-2, from the HNE-treated Trx (Fig. 8A), whereas the native Trx provided no fluorescent products (data not shown). These peptides were further purified and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS. P-1 and P-2 gave a peak of m/z 1382.4 (Fig. 8B) and 3234.0 Da, respectively (Fig. 8C). It was speculated that, relative to the calculated masses of the unmodified peptides, these mass values corresponded to the sequences Cys73–Lys81 (Mr of 1149.41) and Tyr9–Lys36 (Mr of 2944.35), respectively, i.e. an increased mass of 235 Da corresponds to the addition of pyridylaminated HNE per peptide for P-1 and an increased mass of 292 Da corresponds to the addition of pyridylaminated HNE (235 Da) and a carbamidomethyl group (57 Da) per peptide for P-2. The reason for the incomplete digestion at Lys21 in P-2 remains unclear. To confirm the HNE modification sites, the tryptic fragments P-1 and P-2 were further analyzed by MALDI TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometer. Fig. 9A shows the MS/MS spectrum of the [M + H]+ at m/z 1382.4 from P-1. The singly charged C-terminal fragment ions (y-series ions; y1 to y8) were observed in the MS/MS analysis. The b-series fragment ions b2 to b8 were observed to increase by 235 Da, indicating that the HNE modification site in the sequence is on Cys73. The MS/MS spectrum of the [M + H]+ at m/z 3234.0 from P-2 is shown in Fig. 9B. In the MS/MS analysis, the singly charged N-terminal fragment ions (b-series ions; b4 to b22"

In atrial cells and ventricular myocytes, Erg regulates plateau formation and AP repolarization, as blocking Erg channels increases AP length (8Liu S. Rasmusson R.L. Campbell D.L. Wang S.

Erg channels also control the resting membrane potential in various cell types. For example, in neurons of the medial vestibular nucleus, blocking Erg channels produce an increase in AP discharge or in smooth muscle cells, blocking Erg channels mediates depolarization up to 20 mV (13Pessia M.

One study showed that Erg1, -2, and -3 are expressed in rat α- and β-cells and the rat insulinoma cell line, INS-1, and that they are involved in decreasing membrane potential. Blocking Erg channels with the channel antagonist E4031 increases insulin secretion from INS1 cells (24Mühlbauer E. Bazwinsky I. Wolgast S. Klemenz A. Peschke E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 768-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); however, definitive data regarding the role of Erg channels in insulin and glucagon secretion is limited. Therefore this study aimed to define the functions of Erg channels in α- and β-cells. We found that Erg1 channels are strongly expressed in pancreatic α- and β-cells. Pharmacological and genetic manipulation combined with whole cell recordings in pancreatic cell lines and primary islet cells determined that Erg1 produces a functional current in α- and β-cells. Blocking Erg1 increased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) in mouse β-cells, but only in a minority of mouse and human α-cells. Secretion studies using isolated mouse islets demonstrated that Erg1 are negative regulators of insulin secretion, but positive regulators of glucagon secretion, suggesting distinct roles for Erg1 in β- and α-cells.

Detection of ECL (Amersham Biosciences) signal was performed using x-ray film. MIN6 cells were seeded on 12-well plates and at 80% confluency were transfected with 100 nm scramble siRNAs or siRNAs against mouse kcnh2 (5′-CGCAAACUGUCAUUCCGCAtt, 3′-UGCGGAAUGACAGUUUGCGct, Ambion) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h of transfection, cells were used for RNA isolation followed by real-time PCR or reseeded on coverslips for voltage clamp measurements. Total Kv currents were recorded using a whole cell patch clamp. The pipette solution contained (mm): KCl, 140; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; HEPES, 10; EGTA, 10, pH 7.3. Bath solution contained (mm): NaCl, 135; KCl, 5.4; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1.2; HEPES, 10; glucose, 2, pH 7.3. Cells were stimulated by a series of 20-mV depolarization steps of 500 ms from a holding potential of −70 mV. An inward tail current protocol was used to record Erg currents. Currents were elicited by a series of 500-ms pulses applied between 40 mV and −120 mV following a 5-s preconditioning step at 50 mV. A 20-s interval was applied between each pulse. Potassium and sodium concentrations were also adjusted respectively to 40 mm and 102 mm for tail current recordings. rBeKm1-sensitive current (Erg1 current) was calculated by subtracting the traces obtained with blocker to recordings performed in control conditions. Then, the potential dependence curve of Erg1 inactivation was obtained by normalizing the Erg1 current to the maximum current and plotted against the applied potential. V½ and slope were defined with a Boltzmann sigmoid function. The access resistance (≤25 mΩ) was carefully monitored during the recordings. For Kv current measurements, steady-state current was analyzed during the last 5% of depolarization. All voltage recordings were amplified (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA; Heka EPC9, Heka Electronic inc, Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada) and then digitized and analyzed using pClamp9.0 or Pulse software. The electrophysiological values were not corrected with the junction potential. GFP-positive cells were selected for β-cells recordings. Small GFP-negative cells with a membrane capacity inferior of 3 picofarads (pF) were used for α-cells recordings. Area under the curve (AUC) of Erg1 current was calculated with a trapezoidal integration in Igor Pro software (Wavemetrics, Inc.) over a period of 100 ms following the onset of the Erg1 current. At the end of each recording session, tetraethylammonium (20 mm) was used to block the K+ current to confirm that we were observing the delayed rectifying K+ current (data not shown). Changes in [Ca2+]i concentrations were assessed using Fura-2 AM. Cells were plated on glass coverslips (diameter: 22 mm; thickness: 0.17 mm) and left in a humidified incubator for 12 h. Before the imaging experiment, cells were loaded with 2 μm Fura-2 AM in a bath solution (0 mm glucose) at 37 °C for 50 min. Cells were washed and placed in a chamber on the microscope stage, perifused with bath solution at 1 ml/min at 37 °C. Experiments were performed using a BX51W1 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a ×20/0.95 water immersion objective and cooled charge-coupled device camera. Dual excitation at 340/380 nm was used and emission at 510 nm measured (ImageMaster 3 software, Photon Technology International, London, Ontario, Canada). 300-ms exposures were taken every 3 s. AUC of the Fura-2 AM ratio was calculated with a trapezoidal integration in Igor Pro software (Wavemetrics, Inc.) and normalized to the time. Only cells displaying a response to 30 mm KCl solution were included. Fresh isolated mouse islets (20/vial) were preincubated for 60 and 30 min in a glucose-free Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.28 mm CaCl2, 5.0 mm NaCO3, 25 mm HEPES, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, KRB). The islets were then incubated for 90 min in 2.7, 11.1, and 20 mm glucose KRB in the presence or absence of Erg channel blockers. Human islets were hand-picked and incubated for 12–24 h in a 37 °C humidified incubator under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Then, the same insulin secretion protocol described above was used. MIN6 cells were seeded into 24-well plates and incubated for 48–72 h before glucose-stimulated insulin secretion studies were performed. Cells were preincubated for 1 h in glucose-free KRB followed by 1-h secretion in KRB containing 1 mm or 16 mm glucose. The supernatant of the cells was collected and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris and insulin, and glucagon was measured by radioimmunoassay as described previously (29Salehi A. Chen D. Håkanson R. Nordin G. Lundquist I. J. Physiol. 1999; 514: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cell pellets were lysed with acid ethanol (75% ethanol containing 1.5% (v/v) HCl). The samples were dried with a centriVap centrifugal vacuum concentrators connected to a cold trap and a pump (Labconco, Kansas City, MO). DNA was redissolved in 50 μl of ultrapure water and quantified with the BioPhotometer Plus spectrophotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg. Germany). The insulin and glucagon secretion were normalized to DNA content. 100 isolated islets were incubated for 24 h. The day of the experiment, islets were preincubated in low glucose (3 mm) RPMI media for 2 h. The perifusion experiment started with a 3 mm glucose KRB buffer incubation. After 20 min, glucose was increased to 11 mm for 15 min. Then 11 mm glucose KRB with or without rBeKm1 was applied for 13 min. Finally, islets were incubated in KCl (30 mm for 15 min). Aliquots of KRB solution were collected every minute using a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Insulin in the samples was measured using the Linco Research RIA kit and normalized to DNA content. Grouped results were analyzed using a Student's t test, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The n values indicate number of independent observations. We performed a qPCR profile of Kv channel expression in Min6 and α-TC6 cell lines and in human and mouse islets (Fig. 1). In mouse islets (Fig. 1A), Kv2.1, -4.1, -5.1, -6.2, and -9.3 in addition to Kv11.1–11.3 were highly expressed. Kv11.1, -11.2, and -11.3 correspond to Erg1, -2, and -3, respectively. Similar results were obtained from Min6 cells (Fig. 1B), with the exception of Kv6.2, which was not expressed. α-TC6 cells displayed high expression of Kv2.1, -3.3, -3.4, -4.1, -4.3, -5.1, -6.1, -6.3, and -11.1, with some expression of Kv11.2 (Fig. 1C). Expression of Kv11.1 dominated, as it was almost five times higher than the Kv2.1 expression. In human islets (Fig. 1D), we detected high expression of Kv1.5, -6.1, -6.2, and the Kv11 isoforms. Nevertheless, the Kv11.1 channel isoform was expressed the highest. Because Erg1 was highly expressed at the transcript level in α-TC6, Min6 cells, mouse, and human islets, we confirmed its protein expression by Western blot. A band corresponding to Erg1 channel (130 kDa) was detected in the protein lysates of Min6 cells and mouse islets (Fig. 2A). Subcellular fractionation confirmed that Erg1 was expressed at the plasma membrane in Min6 and α-TC6 cells and was absent from the cytosol (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Protein expression of Erg1 channel isoform in Min6 cells, α-TC6 cells, mouse islets (MI), and brain. A, Erg1 expression was detected in protein lysate of Min6 (n = 10) and mouse islet (MI, n = 5). Min6 cells overexpressing the human Erg isoform (OVE) and brain lysate (n = 3) were also used as a positive control. β-Actin was used as a loading control.

https://openalex.org/W2103286638,Eighty-eight rice (Oryza sativa) cDNAs encoding rice leaf expressed protein kinases (PKs) were fused to a Tandem Affinity Purification tag (TAP-tag) and expressed in transgenic rice plants. The TAP-tagged PKs and interacting proteins were purified from the T1 progeny of the transgenic rice plants and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Forty-five TAP-tagged PKs were recovered in this study and thirteen of these were found to interact with other rice proteins with a high probability score. In vivo phosphorylated sites were found for three of the PKs. A comparison of the TAP-tagged data from a combined analysis of 129 TAP-tagged rice protein kinases with a concurrent screen using yeast two hybrid methods identified an evolutionarily new rice protein that interacts with the well conserved cell division cycle 2 (CDC2) protein complex.
https://openalex.org/W2093403863,"Host recognition of mycobacterial surface molecules occurs through toll like receptors (TLR) 2 and 6. The adaptor protein TIRAP mediates down stream signalling of TLR2 and 4, and polymorphisms in the TIRAP gene (TIRAP) have been associated with susceptibility and resistance to tuberculosis (TB) in adults. In order to investigate the role of polymorphic variation in TIRAP in childhood TB in South Africa, which has one of the highest TB incidence rates in the world, we screened the entire open reading frame of TIRAP for sequence variation in two cohorts of childhood TB from different ethnic groups (Xhosa and mixed ancestry). We identified 13 SNPs, including seven previously unreported, in the two cohorts, and found significant differences in frequency of the variants between the two ethnic groups. No differences in frequency between individual SNPs or combinations were found between TB cases and controls in either cohort. However the 558C→T SNP previously associated with TB meningitis (TBM) in a Vietnamese population was found to be associated with TBM in the mixed ancestry group. Polymorphisms in TIRAP do not appear to be involved in childhood TB susceptibility in South Africa, but may play a role in determining occurrence of TBM."
https://openalex.org/W2072742118,"With recent advances in understanding of the neuroscience of risk taking, attention is now turning to genetic factors that may contribute to individual heterogeneity in risk attitudes. In this paper we test for genetic associations with risk attitude measures derived from both the psychology and economics literature. To develop a long-term prospective study, we first evaluate both types of risk attitudes and find that the economic and psychological measures are poorly correlated, suggesting that different genetic factors may underlie human response to risk faced in different behavioral domains. We then examine polymorphisms in a spectrum of candidate genes that affect neurotransmitter systems influencing dopamine regulation or are thought to be associated with risk attitudes or impulsive disorders. Analysis of the genotyping data identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding the alpha 4 nicotine receptor (CHRNA4, rs4603829 and rs4522666) that are significantly associated with harm avoidance, a risk attitude measurement drawn from the psychology literature. Novelty seeking, another risk attitude measure from the psychology literature, is associated with several COMT (catechol-O-methyl transferase) SNPs while economic risk attitude measures are associated with several VMAT2 (vesicular monoamine transporter) SNPs, but the significance of these associations did not withstand statistical adjustment for multiple testing and requires larger cohorts. These exploratory results provide a starting point for understanding the genetic basis of risk attitudes by considering the range of methods available for measuring risk attitudes and by searching beyond the traditional direct focus on dopamine and serotonin receptor and transporter genes."
https://openalex.org/W2101960365,"XplA is a cytochrome P450 of unique structural organization, consisting of a heme-domain that is C-terminally fused to its native flavodoxin redox partner. XplA, along with flavodoxin reductase XplB, has been shown to catalyze the breakdown of the nitramine explosive and pollutant hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (royal demolition explosive) by reductive denitration. The structure of the heme domain of XplA (XplA-heme) has been solved in two crystal forms: as a dimer in space group P2(1) to a resolution of 1.9 A and as a monomer in space group P2(1)2(1)2 to a resolution of 1.5 A, with the ligand imidazole bound at the heme iron. Although it shares the overall fold of cytochromes P450 of known structure, XplA-heme is unusual in that the kinked I-helix that traverses the distal face of the heme is broken by Met-394 and Ala-395 in place of the well conserved Asp/Glu plus Thr/Ser, important in oxidative P450s for the scission of the dioxygen bond prior to substrate oxygenation. The heme environment of XplA-heme is hydrophobic, featuring a cluster of three methionines above the heme, including Met-394. Imidazole was observed bound to the heme iron and is in close proximity to the side chain of Gln-438, which is situated over the distal face of the heme. Imidazole is also hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule that sits in place of the threonine side-chain hydroxyl exemplified by Thr-252 in Cyt-P450cam. Both Gln-438 --> Ala and Ala-395 --> Thr mutants of XplA-heme displayed markedly reduced activity compared with the wild type for royal demolition explosive degradation when combined with surrogate electron donors."
https://openalex.org/W2149835124,"Oxidative stress is thought to compromise muscle contractility. However, administration of generic antioxidants has failed to convincingly improve performance during exhaustive exercise. One possible explanation may relate to the inability of the supplemented antioxidants to effectively eliminate excessive free radicals at the site of generation. Here, we tested whether delivering catalase to the mitochondria, a site of free radical production in contracting muscle, could improve treadmill performance in C57Bl/6 mice. Recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype-9 (AV.RSV.MCAT) was generated to express a mitochondria-targeted catalase gene. AV.RSV.MCAT was delivered to newborn C57Bl/6 mouse circulation at the dose of 10(12) vector genome particles per mouse. Three months later, we observed a approximately 2 to 10-fold increase of catalase protein and activity in skeletal muscle and the heart. Subcellular fractionation western blot and double immunofluorescence staining confirmed ectopic catalase expression in the mitochondria. Compared with untreated control mice, absolute running distance and body weight normalized running distance were significantly improved in AV.RSV.MCAT infected mice during exhaustive treadmill running. Interestingly, ex vivo contractility of the extensor digitorum longus muscle was not altered. Taken together, we have demonstrated that forced catalase expression in the mitochondria enhances exercise performance. Our result provides a framework for further elucidating the underlying mechanism. It also raises the hope of applying similar strategies to remove excessive, pathogenic free radicals in certain muscle diseases (such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy) and ameliorate muscle disease."

https://openalex.org/W2012926944,"IL-7 is an essential cytokine in T-cell development and homeostasis. It binds to the IL-7R receptor, a complex of the IL-7Ralpha (CD127) and common gamma (CD132) chains. There is significant interest in evaluating the expression of CD127 on human T-cells as it often decreased in medical conditions leading to lymphopenia. Previous reports showed the usefulness of CD127 as a prognostic marker in viral infections such as HIV, CMV, EBV and HCV. A soluble CD127 (sCD127) is released in plasma and may contribute to disease pathogenesis through its control on IL-7 activities. Measuring sCD127 is important to define its role and may complement existing markers used in lymphopenic disease management. We describe a new quantitative assay for the measurement of sCD127 in plasma and report sCD127 concentrations in healthy adults.We developed a quantitative bead-based sCD127 capture assay. Polyclonal CD127-specific antibodies were chosen for capture and a biotinylated monoclonal anti-CD127 antibody was selected for detection. The assay can detect native sCD127 and recombinant sCD127 which served as the calibrator. The analytical performance of the assay was characterized and the concentration and stability of plasma sCD127 in healthy adults was determined. The assay's range was 3.2-1000 ng/mL. The concentration of plasma sCD127 was 164+/-104 ng/mL with over a log variation between subjects. Individual sCD127 concentrations remained stable when measured serially during a period of up to one year.This is the first report on the quantification of plasma sCD127 in a population of healthy adults. Soluble CD127 plasma concentrations remained stable over time in a given individual and sCD127 immunoreactivity was resistant to repeated freeze-thaw cycles. This quantitative sCD127 assay is a valuable tool for defining the potential role of sCD127 in lymphopenic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2167682256,"Noggin protein is a potent bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist capable of inhibiting vasculogenesis even in the presence of provasculogenic VEGF and FGF-2. We found that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) do not express Noggin in culture and used these cells for modeling of antivasculogenesis. We hypothesized that high-efficiency transduction of HUVECs with bicistronic lentiviral vector encoding Noggin and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) enables direct visualization of Noggin effects in homogenous primary cell populations in vitro and in vivo. By comparing HUVECs transduced with a control GFP and GFP/Noggin expression cassettes, we showed that constitutive and orthotopic Noggin protein expression did not influence cell proliferation, down-regulated BMP-2 expression, and showed no effect on BMP receptor transcripts. We demonstrated that in contrast to GFP-only control, Noggin expression in endothelial cells abrogated endothelial migration in response to monolayer injury, blocked endothelial transmigration, and caused abrogation of cord formation in vitro. Adding exogenous BMP-4 restored the formation of cords. Imaging experiments in vivo investigated vessel formation in Matrigel implants in athymic mice by utilizing GFP imaging or magnetic resonance imaging of perfusion in the implants. Both approaches demonstrated the lack of functional vessel formation after the adoptive transfer of GFP/Noggin-expressing human endothelial cells in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2162333980,"In this paper, we present numerical evidence that supports the notion of minimization in the sequence space of proteins for a target conformation. We use the conformations of the real proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and present computationally efficient methods to identify the sequences with minimum energy. We use edge-weighted connectivity graph for ranking the residue sites with reduced amino acid alphabet and then use continuous optimization to obtain the energy-minimizing sequences. Our methods enable the computation of a lower bound as well as a tight upper bound for the energy of a given conformation. We validate our results by using three different inter-residue energy matrices for five proteins from protein data bank (PDB), and by comparing our energy-minimizing sequences with 80 million diverse sequences that are generated based on different considerations in each case. When we submitted some of our chosen energy-minimizing sequences to Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), we obtained some sequences from non-redundant protein sequence database that are similar to ours with an E-value of the order of 10(-7). In summary, we conclude that proteins show a trend towards minimizing energy in the sequence space but do not seem to adopt the global energy-minimizing sequence. The reason for this could be either that the existing energy matrices are not able to accurately represent the inter-residue interactions in the context of the protein environment or that Nature does not push the optimization in the sequence space, once it is able to perform the function."

The general theory of relativity predicts that all accelerating objects produce gravitational waves — analogous to electromagnetic waves — that should be detectable for instance in the case of extremely massive objects such as black holes undergoing acceleration. The existence of such waves has been inferred indirectly, but an important goal in physics is their direct observation, a feat that would both validate Einstein's theory and lead to new areas of cosmology. Now early results from LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory), one of the handful of detectors searching for gravity waves, have provided a starting point for further gravity hunts by deriving an upper limit for the stochastic background of gravitational waves of cosmological origin. The data rule out models of early Universe evolution with a relatively large equation-of-state parameter, as well as cosmic (super)string models with relatively small string tension that are favoured in some string theory models."
