This relationship between enzyme and substrate is surprisingly specific and frequently rapid (of the order of minutes), and considerable evidence has been adduced concerning the independence of this process from cellular division (1). In view of the nature and circumstances of these relationships this phenomenon is thought to be concerned with the adaptive control of enzyme formation. Factors controlling enzyme formation have been of considerable interest in mammalian studies and have been pursued along numerous lines; a voluminous literature on endocrine factors, for instance, exists. However, with respect to substrate-induced changes in enzyme concentration, investigations of mammalian tissue have been quite different from the bacteriological studies. In general, the specificity of the relationship was poor. Furthermore, the periods involved were of the order of weeks. The work of Lightbody and Kleinman (2) and, more recently, of Mandelstam and Yudkin (3) is typical in this regard; the content of dietary protein was precisely correlated with activity in rat liver arginase after several weeks of feeding. It is apparent that adaptation, in the sense of the bacteriologic experiments, had not been demonstrated here. In 1951 Knox showed that the tryptophan peroxidase system of rat liver was under adaptive control (4). The intraperitoneal administration of L-tryptophan to the intact rat resulted, within a very few hours, in a lo-fold increase in enzyme activity, and the specificity of this relationship was demonstrated in the adrenalectomized rat. Consequently, this was the first specific demonstration of a rapid, substrate-induced change in enzyme activity, corresponding to the general criteria developed from microbiological studies. We have been interested in the significance of protein turnover in mammals, and it, was in view of Knoxâ€™s experiments that we have investigated"
