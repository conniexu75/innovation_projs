https://openalex.org/W2112215441,"Room-temperature single-electron transistors are realized within individual metallic single-wall carbon nanotube molecules. The devices feature a short (down to approximately 20 nanometers) nanotube section that is created by inducing local barriers into the tube with an atomic force microscope. Coulomb charging is observed at room temperature, with an addition energy of 120 millielectron volts, which substantially exceeds the thermal energy. At low temperatures, we resolve the quantum energy levels corresponding to the small island. We observe unconventional power-law dependencies in the measured transport properties for which we suggest a resonant tunneling Luttinger-liquid mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2063041018,"Clock:BMAL1 and NPAS2:BMAL1 are heterodimeric transcription factors that control gene expression as a function of the light-dark cycle. Although built to fluctuate at or near a 24-hour cycle, the clock can be entrained by light, activity, or food. Here we show that the DNA-binding activity of the Clock:BMAL1 and NPAS2:BMAL1 heterodimers is regulated by the redox state of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) cofactors in a purified system. The reduced forms of the redox cofactors, NAD(H) and NADP(H), strongly enhance DNA binding of the Clock:BMAL1 and NPAS2:BMAL1 heterodimers, whereas the oxidized forms inhibit. These observations raise the possibility that food, neuronal activity, or both may entrain the circadian clock by direct modulation of cellular redox state."
https://openalex.org/W1986801254,"Scandium(III)-catalyzed oxidation of meso-meso-linked zinc(II)-porphyrin arrays (up to dodecamers) with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) led to efficient formation of triply meso-meso-, beta-beta-, and beta-beta-linked zinc(II)-oligoiporphyrins with 62 to 91% yields. These fused tape-shaped porphyrin arrays display extremely red-shifted absorption bands that reflect extensively pi-conjugated electronic systems and a low excitation gap. The lowest electronic absorption bands become increasingly intensified and red-shifted upon the increase in the number of porphyrins and eventually reach a peak electronic excitation for the dodecamer at approximately 3500 wavenumber. The one-electron oxidation potentials also decreased progressively upon the increase in the number of porphyrins. These properties in long and rigid molecular shapes suggest their potential use as molecular wires."
https://openalex.org/W2084245258,"The Northern Hemisphere annular mode (NAM) (also known as the North Atlantic Oscillation) is shown to exert a strong influence on wintertime climate, not only over the Euro-Atlantic half of the hemisphere as documented in previous studies, but over the Pacific half as well. It affects not only the mean conditions, but also the day-to-day variability, modulating the intensity of mid-latitude storms and the frequency of occurrence of high-latitude blocking and cold air outbreaks throughout the hemisphere. The recent trend in the NAM toward its high-index polarity with stronger subpolar westerlies has tended to reduce the severity of winter weather over most middle- and high-latitude Northern Hemisphere continental regions."
https://openalex.org/W1982650546,"Cloning by nuclear transfer (NT) is an inefficient process in which most clones die before birth and survivors often display growth abnormalities. In an effort to correlate gene expression with survival and fetal overgrowth, we have examined imprinted gene expression in both mice cloned by nuclear transfer and in the embryonic stem (ES) cell donor populations from which they were derived. The epigenetic state of the ES cell genome was found to be extremely unstable. Similarly, variation in imprinted gene expression was observed in most cloned mice, even in those derived from ES cells of the same subclone. Many of the animals survived to adulthood despite widespread gene dysregulation, indicating that mammalian development may be rather tolerant to epigenetic aberrations of the genome. These data imply that even apparently normal cloned animals may have subtle abnormalities in gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1965359283,"Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) is a transcription factor expressed primarily in the mammalian forebrain. NPAS2 is highly related in primary amino acid sequence to Clock, a transcription factor expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus that heterodimerizes with BMAL1 and regulates circadian rhythm. To investigate the biological role of NPAS2, we prepared a neuroblastoma cell line capable of conditional induction of the NPAS2:BMAL1 heterodimer and identified putative target genes by representational difference analysis, DNA microarrays, and Northern blotting. Coinduction of NPAS2 and BMAL1 activated transcription of the endogenous Per1 , Per2 , and Cry1 genes, which encode negatively activating components of the circadian regulatory apparatus, and repressed transcription of the endogenous BMAL1 gene. Analysis of the frontal cortex of wild-type mice kept in a 24-hour light-dark cycle revealed that Per1 , Per2 , and Cry1 mRNA levels were elevated during darkness and reduced during light, whereas BMAL1 mRNA displayed the opposite pattern. In situ hybridization assays of mice kept in constant darkness revealed that Per2 mRNA abundance did not oscillate as a function of the circadian cycle in NPAS2-deficient mice. Thus, NPAS2 likely functions as part of a molecular clock operative in the mammalian forebrain."

It places the sulfur of cysteine 39 at ∼4.2 Å from the C(4a) carbon of the FMN chromophore.

https://openalex.org/W2016489131,"The existence of a large number of receptors coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) raises the question of how a particular receptor selectively regulates specific targets. We provide insight into this question by identifying a prototypical macromolecular signaling complex. The β 2 adrenergic receptor was found to be directly associated with one of its ultimate effectors, the class C L-type calcium channel Ca v 1.2. This complex also contained a G protein, an adenylyl cyclase, cyclic adenosine monophosphate–dependent protein kinase, and the counterbalancing phosphatase PP2A. Our electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal neurons demonstrate highly localized signal transduction from the receptor to the channel. The assembly of this signaling complex provides a mechanism that ensures specific and rapid signaling by a G protein–coupled receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2037908764,We report the direct observation of quantum dynamical tunneling of atoms between separated momentum regions in phase space. We study how the tunneling oscillations are affected as a quantum symmetry is broken and as the initial atomic state is changed. We also provide evidence that the tunneling rate is greatly enhanced by the presence of chaos in the classical dynamics. This tunneling phenomenon represents a dramatic manifestation of underlying classical chaos in a quantum system.
https://openalex.org/W1996554410,"Marine mammals often forage in dark or turbid waters. Whereas dolphins use echolocation under such conditions, pinnipeds apparently lack this sensory ability. For seals hunting in the dark, one source of sensory information may consist of fish-generated water movements, which seals can detect with their highly sensitive whiskers. Water movements in the wake of fishes persist for several minutes. Here we show that blindfolded seals can use their whiskers to detect and accurately follow hydrodynamic trails generated by a miniature submarine. This shows that hydrodynamic information can be used for long-distance prey location."

https://openalex.org/W2087410623,"Time series of alkenone unsaturation indices gathered along the California margin reveal large (4 degrees to 8 degrees C) glacial-interglacial changes in sea surface temperature (SST) over the past 550,000 years. Interglacial times with SSTs equal to or exceeding that of the Holocene contain peak abundances in the pollen of redwood, the distinctive component of the temperate rainforest of the northwest coast of California. In the region now dominated by the California Current, SSTs warmed 10,000 to 15,000 years in advance of deglaciation at each of the past five glacial maxima. SSTs did not rise in advance of deglaciation south of the modern California Current front. Glacial warming along the California margin therefore is a regional signal of the weakening of the California Current during times when large ice sheets reorganized wind systems over the North Pacific. Both the timing and magnitude of the SST estimates suggest that the Devils Hole (Nevada) calcite record represents regional but not global paleotemperatures, and hence does not pose a fundamental challenge to the orbital (""Milankovitch"") theory of the Ice Ages."

The process of angiogenesis requires the migration of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in response to an angiogenic stimulus. Hence, tissue remodeling by plasmin degradation of the extracellular matrix is likely to be important (3Carmeliet P. Schoonjans L. Kieckens L. Ream B. Degen J. Bronson R. De Vos R. van den Oord J.J.

Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)1 and tissue-type plasminogen activator both activate the zymogen plasminogen to plasmin, and localization of uPA to the leading edge of migrating cells is thought to initiate a proteinase cascade, which degrades the extracellular matrix and promotes cell migration (4Johnsen M.

It exists in multiple conformational states, including active, latent, and cleaved forms, and both latent and cleaved PAI-1 are thought to be biologically inactive. PAI-1 also interacts with a number of non-proteinase ligands, including the cell adhesion protein, vitronectin (7Lawrence D.A. Palaniappan S. Stefansson S. Olson S.T. Francis-Chmura A.M. Shore J.D.

We have previously shown that PAI-1 bound to vitronectin inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell migration by a mechanism that is independent of its ability to inhibit proteinase activity, but instead acts by preventing binding of the αVβ3 integrin to vitronectin (9Stefansson S.

Furthermore, in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, PAI-1 inhibits angiogenesis via two overlapping mechanisms that depend on either its ability to inhibit proteinase activity or to block integrin binding to vitronectin (10Stefansson S.

Latent PAI-1, which lacks both these functions, was unable to inhibit angiogenesis in this assay. Since PAI-1 is a potent inhibitor of cell migration in vitro(9Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8135-8141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), it is striking to note that increased expression of PAI-1 is associated with a poor prognosis in many cancers (12Nekarda H. Siewert J.R. Schmitt M. Ulm K. Lancet. 1994; 343: 117Abstract PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Pedersen H. Brunner N. Francis D. Osterlind K. Ronne E. Hansen H.H. Dano K. Grondahl-Hansen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4671-4675PubMed Google Scholar). PAI-1 has also been suggested to modulate tumor growth and angiogenesis, since both tumor development and vascularization were reduced in PAI-1-deficient mice (14Bajou K. Noel A. Gerard R.D. Masson V. Brunner N. Holst-Hansen C. Skobe M. Fusenig N.E. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Foidart J.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 15Gutierrez L.S. Schulman A. Brito-Robinson T. Noria F. Ploplis V.A. Castellino F.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5839-5847PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to these results, the growth of bib16 murine melanoma tumors was unaffected by the levels of PAI-1 expression in either PAI-1 null or PAI-1 overexpressing mice (16Eitzman D.T. Krauss J.C. Shen T. Cui J. Ginsburg D. Blood. 1996; 87: 4718-4722PubMed Google Scholar), while overexpression of PAI-1 in PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells inhibited both tumor growth and angiogenesis (17Soff G.A. Sanderowitz J. Gately S. Verrusio E. Weiss I. Brem S. Kwaan H.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2593-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, the exact role of PAI-1 in regulating tumor growth and angiogenesis has not been clearly defined. Therefore, we have examined whether PAI-1 can affect tumor growth through the regulation of angiogenesis, and we demonstrate that PAI-1 can both inhibit and enhance the growth of M21 human melanoma tumors, apparently by regulating angiogenesis. The constitutively active PAI-1 (14-1b) and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for functional human PAI-1 (HPAIKT) were from Molecular Innovations. This form of PAI-1 is identical to wild-type PAI-1 with respect to proteinase inhibition and binding to vitronectin, but has a half-life of 145 h, compared with 2 h for wild-type PAI-1 and, therefore, will maintain its biological activity during the extended period of these experiments (18Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The partially inactivated (92% latent) wild-type PAI-1 was isolated as described previously (19Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-221Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The M21 tumor growth assay was performed as described previously (20Petitclerc E. Stromblad S. von Schalscha T.L. Mitjans F. Piulats J. Montgomery A.M. Cheresh D.A. Brooks P.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2724-2730PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent cultures of human M21 melanoma cells were harvested and washed in serum-free RPMI, and 3 × 106 cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 6-week-old nude mice. After 3 days, the mice were given daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections of 100 or 10 μg of the PAI-1 variants or PBS. Tumor growth was monitored every week for 3 weeks by an individual blind to the experimental conditions, and tumor volume was determined by measuring the length and the width of the growing tumor using a caliper. At the end of each experiment, the mice were euthanized and the primary tumor harvested free of adherent skin and tissues and processed for histochemistry. For each condition at least two independent experiments were performed. Angiogenesis was quantitated in tumor sections by counting the number of branch points in fields from sections stained with antibodies against von Willebrand factor. For each section, 10 random fields at × 400 magnification were counted, with four to five sections per treatment being counted in a blind manner. The Matrigel implantation assay was based on the method of Passaniti (21Passaniti A. Taylor R.M. Pili R. Guo Y. Long P.V. Haney J.A. Pauly R.R. Grant D.S. Martin G.R. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 519-528PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Matrigel is a squamous cell carcinoma basement membrane matrix composed primarily of collagen IV and laminin. To determine whether Matrigel itself contains the proteolytic factors required for matrix remodeling, an aliquot of Matrigel was analyzed in an immunoblot and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis zymography (22Yepes M. Sandkvist M. Wong M.K. Coleman T.A. Smith E. Cohan S.L. Lawrence D.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 569-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis demonstrated an absence of plasminogen and uPA, and only small amounts of tissue-type plasminogen activator that only became apparent after prolonged incubation of the zymographic film (data not shown). Thus, any factors required for proteolytic remodeling of the matrix must therefore be provided by the host and not the Matrigel. Prior to injection fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) was incubated with 10 units/ml heparin for 5 min then diluted in Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, phenol red-free) on ice for a final concentration of 250 ng/ml FGF-2 and 0.0025 unit/ml heparin. PAI-1 samples or buffer alone were then added and the samples kept on ice until injection. Wild-type, PAI-1-deficient (originally obtained from Dr. Peter Carmeliet and back-crossed onto C57/B6J for 8 generations) or PAI-1 transgenic C57/B6J mice (16Eitzman D.T. Krauss J.C. Shen T. Cui J. Ginsburg D. Blood. 1996; 87: 4718-4722PubMed Google Scholar) between 6 and 12 weeks old were subcutaneously injected under anesthesia in the ventral midline region with 0.5 ml of Matrigel alone or with Matrigel containing FGF-2 ± PAI-1. Alternatively, mice were injected with Matrigel containing FGF-2 then treated with daily IP injections of PBS or PAI-1. After 5–7 days the mice were euthanized and the Matrigel implant harvested, washed twice with PBS, and examined macroscopically for signs of hematoma. Any implant with visible signs of hematoma was excluded from analysis. The remaining implants were then immediately frozen on dry ice and lyophilized overnight. The weight of the dry Matrigel was determined and the implants resuspended in 0.4 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h, disrupted by vigorous pipetting and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 15 min to remove particulates. The concentration of hemoglobin in the supernatant was then determined directly by absorbance at 405 nm (23Gigli I. Ruddy S. Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1968; 100: 1154-1164PubMed Google Scholar) and compared with a standard curve of purified hemoglobin (Sigma). For histochemical analysis of frozen tumor samples, tissues were embedded in OCT and snap-frozen in a 2-methylbutane dry ice slurry and stored at −80 °C until processing. Sections were cut at 5 μm and fixed for 10 min in methanol/acetone (1:1) and rinsed in PBS. For histochemical analysis of formalin-fixed Matrigel samples, tissues were embedded in paraffin and cut at 5 μm. The frozen or formalin-fixed samples were then analyzed either by hematoxylin-eosin staining or by immunohistochemistry as described previously (10Stefansson S. Petitclerc E. Wong M.K. McMahon G.A. Brooks P.C. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8135-8141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 22Yepes M. Sandkvist M. Wong M.K. Coleman T.A. Smith E. Cohan S.L. Lawrence D.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 569-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the tumors and implants were treated with 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min to exhaust endogenous peroxidase activity, then stained with rabbit anti-human von Willebrand factor (Dako) followed by detection with mouse-absorbed biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG1 and horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin according to the manufacturer (Vector Laboratories) and developed with the chromogen 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) for 4 min. Mayer's hematoxylin was used as a counterstain. Tumor sections were also stained with biotinylated murine anti-human collagen IV (Dako) or biotinylated murine anti-smooth muscle cell actin (Sigma) and detected with the ABC Elite kit as described by the manufacturer (Vector Laboratories). The sections were developed and counterstained as described above. For immunofluorescence staining of tumor sections, slides were treated as above and then double stained with rabbit anti-murine vitronectin (Molecular Innovations) and rat anti-murine PECAM-1 (PharMingen) and detected with Flour 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) and Texas Red rat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). The nuclei of the tumor cells were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Molecular Probes). Apoptosis of tumor sections was determined by TUNEL reactivity using the Apoptag Kit (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD) as described previously (22Yepes M. Sandkvist M. Wong M.K. Coleman T.A. Smith E. Cohan S.L. Lawrence D.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 569-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microscopy and photography were carried out using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope attached to a Spot RT slider digital camera with a Kodak KAI-2092 cooled color chip. Because the growth of solid tumors requires an adequate blood supply, agents that block angiogenesis are likely to inhibit tumor growth. Since we have shown previously that PAI-1 is a potent inhibitor of vascular cell migration in vitro (9Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and angiogenesis in the chick CAMin vivo (10Stefansson S. Petitclerc E. Wong M.K. McMahon G.A. Brooks P.C. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8135-8141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), we decided to test whether PAI-1 treatment could inhibit tumor growth in mice. M21 human melanoma cells (3 × 106) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of nude mice, and allowed to establish for 3 days, after which the mice were treated with daily IP injections of PAI-1 (100 μg) for 21 days. A sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for active human PAI-1 demonstrated that 4 h after injection, plasma PAI-1 levels ranged between 32 and 122 nm, with a mean of 61 nm. This is ∼3000-fold higher than the reported normal murine plasma level of 0.02 nm (16Eitzman D.T. Krauss J.C. Shen T. Cui J. Ginsburg D. Blood. 1996; 87: 4718-4722PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with active PAI-1 decreased M21 tumor growth by ∼66% (p = 0.01) (Fig.1). As a negative control, mice were also treated with partially inactivated PAI-1 (∼92% latent). However, this treatment unexpectedly increased tumor growth significantly (∼46% relative to PBS-treated animals (p = 0.05)). Quantitation of active recombinant PAI-1 in plasma 4 h after injection of mice with this partially inactivated PAI-1 showed a range of 0.03 to 0.11 nm, with a mean of 0.07 nm. This suggested that low levels of active PAI-1 may promote tumor growth. To see if the effect of PAI-1 on tumor growth might be due to its regulation of angiogenesis or to a direct effect on the tumor cells, histological sections of the various tumors were examined. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that treatment of tumors with PAI-1 did not appear to alter the extent of necrosis within the tissue (Fig.2, A–C). Likewise, TUNEL staining for apoptotic cells indicated that the extent of apoptosis was very low in the healthy tissue and was mostly confined to areas of dead tissue and was not altered by the different treatments (Fig. 2,D–F). Finally, staining for the proliferative cell nuclear antigen, a marker for dividing cells, did not show any obvious differences between the three treatments (data not shown). However, it is possible that some differences in the rates of tumor cell proliferation might not be observed by this analysis. This is because the relative number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells per field can only indicate the proportion of tumor cells that are in similar phases of the cell cycle, but cannot determine whether the tumor cells are progressing through the cell cycle at the same rate. Nonetheless, together with the results of the TUNEL staining, these data suggest that PAI-1 addition does not appear to directly affect M21 tumor cell viability, and thus implies that the differences in the tumor growth rates are likely to result from indirect effects of PAI-1 on tumor growth. To examine whether PAI-1 treatment influenced angiogenesis in the tumors, sections were stained with antibodies against von Willebrand factor (Fig. 2, G–I). Sections from PBS-treated animals demonstrated a multibranched pattern of vessels. In contrast, tumor vessels from animals treated with partially inactivated PAI-1 appeared more branched, whereas tumor vessels from animals treated with fully active PAI-1 appeared longer with a decreased number of branch points. Quantitation of branch points within the tumor sections showed that the fully active PAI-1-treated tumors had significantly fewer branch points per field relative to control tumors, while treatment with partially inactivated PAI-1 significantly increased branch point number (TableI). This mirrored the results obtained in tumor growth experiments and suggested that the differences in tumor volume observed with the PAI-1 treatments may be due to PAI-1 altering the extent of angiogenesis in the tumors.Table IQuantitation of branch points from von Willebrand factor-stained tumor sectionsTreatmentBranch points/fieldS.E.T testPBS28.091.60Active PAI-124.791.200.05Latent (92%) PAI-133.991.870.01 Open table in a new tab To see if the alterations in angiogenesis were associated with structural differences in the tumor vessels, immunohistochemical examination of specific vessel markers was performed. These data are shown in Fig. 3 and demonstrate that apart from the extent of branching, the overall architecture of the vessels was similar in each case. For example, collagen IV was observed in the basement membrane of all the vessels, while as expected smooth muscle actin was only observed in the larger vessels. Immunofluorescence staining also localized vitronectin to the basement membrane of the vessels (Fig. 3, G–I). In this analysis vitronectin is shown in green, juxtaposed to the endothelial cells shown in red, and surrounding the tumor nodules, which are labeled with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride to show the nuclei. Together, these results suggest that both the formation of the capillary basement membrane and the recruitment of smooth muscle cells into larger vessels are similar in each case and that PAI-1 likely regulates tumor growth by controlling the extent of angiogenesis and not the structure of the vessels formed. Since we have shown previously that fully latent PAI-1 (<1% active) does not affect angiogenesis in the chick CAM (10Stefansson S. Petitclerc E. Wong M.K. McMahon G.A. Brooks P.C. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8135-8141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and since two recent reports have suggested that PAI-1 is necessary for angiogenesis (14Bajou K. Noel A. Gerard R.D. Masson V. Brunner N. Holst-Hansen C. Skobe M. Fusenig N.E. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Foidart J.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 15Gutierrez L.S. Schulman A. Brito-Robinson T. Noria F. Ploplis V.A. Castellino F.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5839-5847PubMed Google Scholar), we suspected that the ∼8% active PAI-1 present in the partially inactivated PAI-1 may be responsible for the stimulation of tumor growth and angiogenesis observed in the mice. Therefore, to test the hypothesis that active PAI-1 can stimulate angiogenesis at low levels but is inhibitory at high concentrations, the Matrigel implant assay was used (21Passaniti A. Taylor R.M. Pili R. Guo Y. Long P.V. Haney J.A. Pauly R.R. Grant D.S. Martin G.R. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 519-528PubMed Google Scholar). Matrigel, either with or without FGF-2, was injected subcutaneously into the abdomen of mice and harvested after 5–7 days. This assay permits analysis of the extent of FGF-2-induced angiogenesis into the matrix by either histological examination or by direct measurement of the amount of hemoglobin present in the implant. Quantitative comparison of the number of vessel branch points in von Willebrand factor-stained sections with the hemoglobin content of similar implants gave nearly identical results, indicating that hemoglobin content within an implant accurately reflects the extent of angiogenesis (data not shown). Analysis of Matrigel implants that did not contain growth factor showed very few cells, either within or around the implant, indicating that Matrigel itself is not angiogenic (Fig.4 A). In contrast, sections containing 250 ng/ml FGF-2 (Fig. 4 B) showed many highly branched structures throughout the implant. Closer examination of these sections at high magnification clearly demonstrates that the structures are functioning vessels, since red blood cells can be seen within the vessel (Fig. 4 C). To determine the effect of PAI-1 on angiogenesis in Matrigel implants, we examined FGF-2-treated implants from wild-type mice and compared these to implants from PAI-1−/− mice or from wild-type mice treated with 1 μm PAI-1. Staining of sections with hematoxylin-eosin or with anti-von Willebrand factor demonstrated many highly branched vessels migrating into the center of the FGF-2-treated implant of wild-type mice (Fig. 4, D and G). In contrast, while vessels were formed in the PAI-1-deficient mice, they were located primarily in the periphery of the implant and appeared less branched compared with the wild-type mice (Fig. 4, Eand H). Similarly, sections from implants treated with 1 μm PAI-1 showed that far fewer cells had infiltrated into the implant and that these were located almost exclusively on the perimeter (Fig. 4, F and I), with the interior essentially devoid of cells (data not shown). However, unlike the controls or the PAI-1−/− mice, the cells in the PAI-1-treated implants were not organized into vessels and did not appear to form lumens (Fig. 4, F and I). Thus, PAI-1 seems to be important for regulating both the invasion and formation of the vessels. In the absence of PAI-1, endothelial cells can organize into vessels, but their ability to invade the implant appears to be reduced, whereas when excess PAI-1 is present both vessel invasion and formation is impaired. Quantitative analysis of angiogenesis in wild-type and the PAI-1-deficient mice indicated that angiogenesis in the PAI-1-deficient mice was decreased by 63% relative to wild-type mice (Fig.5 A). These results are also consistent with previous reports that angiogenesis is impaired in PAI-1−/− mice (14Bajou K. Noel A. Gerard R.D. Masson V. Brunner N. Holst-Hansen C. Skobe M. Fusenig N.E. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Foidart J.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 15Gutierrez L.S. Schulman A. Brito-Robinson T. Noria F. Ploplis V.A. Castellino F.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5839-5847PubMed Google Scholar) and suggest that although angiogenesis may proceed in the absence of PAI-1, it appears to be less efficient. In contrast, quantitation of angiogenesis in transgenic mice overexpressing PAI-1 showed a nearly 3-fold increase in angiogenesis compared with controls (Fig. 5 A). The average plasma level of active PAI-1 reported for these mice is 59 ng/ml (∼1.2 nm), which is ∼60-fold higher than the level in wild-type littermate controls, which was 0.02 nm (16Eitzman D.T. Krauss J.C. Shen T. Cui J. Ginsburg D. Blood. 1996; 87: 4718-4722PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together with the results of the PAI-1−/− mice, these data suggest that levels of PAI-1 slightly above normal may stimulate angiogenesis. To directly examine the effect of different PAI-1 concentrations on angiogenesis, C57/B6J mice were injected with Matrigel containing increasing amounts of PAI-1, and the hemoglobin content of the implants was determined after 5 days (Fig. 5 B). While low doses of PAI-1 (0.1 and 1.0 nm) increased angiogenesis in the implants by up to 3-fold relative to FGF-2 alone, PAI-1 concentrations of 10 nm or higher were able to inhibit angiogenesis by nearly 100%. This confirms our hypothesis that PAI-1 at low doses can promote angiogenesis, whereas at higher concentrations it is inhibitory, and suggests that the reason that the partially inactivated PAI-1 stimulated tumor growth and angiogenesis was likely due to the 8% active PAI-1 present in the preparation. However, it is also possible that the systemic administration of PAI-1 yields different results from local delivery or that latent PAI-1 may have an as yet unidentified proangiogenic activity. This latter possibility could be related to earlier observations suggesting that two other inactive serpins, latent or cleaved antithrombin III (24O'Reilly M.S. Pirie-Shepherd S. Lane W.S. Folkman J. Science. 1999; 285: 1926-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and pigment epithelium-derived factor (25Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar), have anti-angiogenic activities. To test these possibilities, FGF-2-containing Matrigel implants were injected into wild-type mice, and the mice were given daily IP injections of PBS or either 100 μg of the same partially inactivated PAI-1 preparation used in the M21 tumor experiments containing ∼8% active PAI-1 or this same preparation after it had been incubated at 37 °C to convert the majority of the active protein to the latent form (<0.5% active PAI-1). After 7 days of treatment, the Matrigel implants were harvested and the hemoglobin content measured as before (Fig. 6). Similar to the M21 tumors, the partially inactivated PAI-1 stimulated angiogenesis by ∼1.5-fold relative to PBS-treated mice (Fig. 6). However, mice treated with fully latent PAI-1 (<0.5% active protein) showed no increase in angiogenesis compared with control mice. These data provide further evidence that low doses of active PAI-1 can promote angiogenesis and strongly suggest that the stimulation of M21 tumor growth and angiogenesis observed with partially inactivated PAI-1 treatment was due to the ∼8% active PAI-1 present in that preparation and not to any proangiogenic activity in the latent PAI-1. These results also suggest that treating M21 tumors with low doses of active recombinant PAI-1 would increase tumor growth by increasing angiogenesis. To see if this would be the case, M21 tumors in nude mice were treated with daily IP injections of 10 μg of PAI-1 and the size of the tumors measured over a 3-week period as before. This dose of PAI-1 corresponds approximately to the level of active PAI-1 injected with the partially inactivated PAI-1 preparation (10 versus 8 μg). The results of these experiments demonstrated that treatment of mice with this low dose of PAI-1 increased M21 tumor growth by 48% relative to the PBS control (data not shown), a result that exactly mirrors the increase in the growth of tumors treated with partially inactivated PAI-1 (Fig. 1). Thus, treatment of tumors with low doses of PAI-1 can stimulate tumor growth most likely by stimulating angiogenesis. The observation that PAI-1 can either enhance or inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis depending upon its concentration may also explain why some studies have shown that PAI-1 is necessary for tumor growth (14Bajou K. Noel A. Gerard R.D. Masson V. Brunner N. Holst-Hansen C. Skobe M. Fusenig N.E. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Foidart J.M. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), while others indicate that PAI-1 either has no affect (16Eitzman D.T. Krauss J.C. Shen T. Cui J. Ginsburg D. Blood. 1996; 87: 4718-4722PubMed Google Scholar) or is inhibitory (17Soff G.A. Sanderowitz J. Gately S. Verrusio E. Weiss I. Brem S. Kwaan H.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2593-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These conflicting results may be a consequence of the novel regulatory role that PAI-1 plays in angiogenesis, and while the mechanism of these seemingly opposing activities is not clear, our previous studies of the effect of PAI-1 on angiogenesis in the chick CAM may provide some insight. In these studies, we demonstrated that high doses of recombinant PAI-1 inhibited angiogenesis in the CAM via two distinct but apparently overlapping pathways. The first was dependent upon PAI-1 inhibition of proteinase activity, while the second was independent of PAI-1's anti-proteinase activity and instead functioned through PAI-1 binding to vitronectin, which in turn blocked access of vascular cell integrins to vitronectin in the matrix (9Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 10Stefansson S. Petitclerc E. Wong M.K. McMahon G.A. Brooks P.C. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol.

A number of studies from other groups have also suggested that both uPA and its receptor, uPAR, can modulate cellular adhesive properties and motility as well as promote angiogenesis (27Wei Y.

Based on these studies and the data presented here we suggest a speculative model for the regulation of angiogenesis by PAI-1 where PAI-1 bound to vitronectin in the provisional angiogenic matrix temporarily blocks αvβ3- and/or αvβ5-mediated adhesion, which in turn prevents the migration necessary for efficient vessel formation. However, since the activated vascular cells express uPA and uPAR, then the cells should be able to remove PAI-1 from the matrix and expose the cryptic integrin adhesion sites on vitronectin. Finally, since uPAR expression is localized to the leading edge of the migrating cells (34Grondahl-Hansen J. Lund L.R. Ralfkiær E. Ottevanger V. Dano K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 90: 790-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), this permits cells expressing uPA and uPAR to preferentially form new adhesion complexes at the apex of the moving angiogenic front, thus imparting directionality to vascular cell migration. On a molecular level, this suggests that the association of integrins with the uPA·uPAR complex (27Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A.

Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, uPA/uPAR may serve to escort the integrin to the appropriate high affinity binding site within the matrix. This may also explain the apparent contradiction between the observation that high doses of PAI-1 can block tumor growth and angiogenesis (Figs.1 and 5), whereas PAI-1-deficient mice appear to show a reduced angiogenic response (Fig. 5) (14Bajou K.

We predict that angiogenesis will only proceed efficiently when PAI-1 levels are within an optimal range. In PAI-1 excess, the vitronectin matrix remains saturated with PAI-1, and integrin adhesion is blocked. Conversely, in PAI-1 deficiency, the uPA/uPAR-facilitated polar localization of integrins may not occur. Finally, our results suggest that PAI-1 is likely to play an important role in regulating tumor growth and angiogenesis, and future studies further characterizing the mechanism of this activity will very likely lead to the development of important new therapeutic agents for controlling angiogenesis in different pathologic situations."

The carbon-13 content of archaeal molecular fossils indicates that these archaea were living chemoautotrophically. Their massive expansion may have been a response to the strong stratification of the ocean during this anoxic event. Indeed, the sedimentary record of archaeal membrane lipids suggests that this anoxic event marks a time in Earth history at which certain hyperthermophilic archaea adapted to low-temperature environments."

MeCP2 is the founder member of a family of methyl-CpG-binding proteins. MeCP2 directly binds to the co-repressor mSin3, which interacts with class I histone deacetylase, recruiting them to methyl-CpG regions to suppress transcription. Here, we report that MeCP2 directly binds to two co-repressors, c-Ski and N-CoR, in addition to mSin3A, and that the c-Ski, which is encoded by the c-ski proto-onocogene, is required for MeCP2-mediated transcriptional repression. The two regions of c-Ski, including the C-terminal coiled-coil region, interact with the transcriptional repression domain in the center of the MeCP2 molecule. The immunostaining signals for c-Ski and MeCP2 overlap in the nuclear heterochromatin region, suggesting the co-localization of the two proteins. The degree of transcriptional repression mediated by a Gal4-MeCP2 fusion protein was abrogated by overexpression of the putative dominant negative form of c-Ski. Furthermore, injection of antibodies against c-Ski and Sno almost completely abolished the transcriptional repression mediated by the Gal4-MeCP2 fusion protein.

Cytosine residues in the sequence 5′-CpG (cytosine-guanine) are often postsynthetically methylated in animal genomes. CpG methylation is essential for mouse development (20Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3262) Google Scholar) and has been linked to long term silencing of certain genes during mammalian development (21Li E. Beard C. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1993; 366: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar, 22Beard C. Li E. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2325-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). For instance, CpG methylation is necessary both for inactivation of the X chromosome and for genomic imprinting. CpG methylation is also involved in repression of viral genomes (23Jahner D. Stuhlmann H. Stewart C.L. Harbers K. Lohler J. Simon I. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1982; 298: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 24Groudine M. Eisenman R. Weintraub H. Nature. 1981; 292: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Further, the methylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters contributes directly to the progression of some cancers (for review, see Ref. 25Jones P.A. Laird P.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar). The methyl-CpG signal is recognized by a group of methyl-CpG-binding proteins that share a well conserved methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) (for review, see Ref. 26Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). The recently reported solution structure of MBD indicated that the recognition of the methyl groups and CG sequence at the methylation site is due to five highly conserved residues that form a hydrophobic patch (27Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Jee J.-G. Ikegami T. Nakao M. Shirakawa M. Cell. 2001; 105: 487-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). MeCP2 is the best characterized member of this family and interacts specifically with methylated DNA to mediate transcriptional repression (28Lewis J.D. Meehan R.R. Henzel W.J. Maurer-Fogy I. Jeppesen P. Klein F. Bird A. Cell. 1992; 69: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 29Boyes J. Bird A.

Cell. 1997; 88: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The X-linked dominant disorder, Rett syndrome, which is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder, was recently found to be caused by mutations in the MeCP2 gene on Xq28 (31Amir R.E. Van den Veyver I.B. Wan M. Tran C.Q. Francke U. Zoghbi H.Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3887) Google Scholar). In fact, a mouse Mecp2-null mutation causes neurological symptoms that mimic Rett syndrome (32Guy J. Hendrich B. Holmes M. Martin J.E. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 33Chen R.Z. Akbarian S. Tudor M. Jaenisch R. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). MeCP2 is an abundant 486-amino acid protein that contains two functional domains, a MBD essential for its binding to methyl-CpG, and a transcriptional repression domain (TRD) that mediates gene silencing. MeCP2 binds to the HDAC complex containing the co-repressor mSin3A via direct interaction between the TRD and mSin3A (34Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2813) Google Scholar, 35Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar). Recruitment of the HDAC complex by MeCP2 is thought to be an important mechanism of the transcriptional repression mediated by methyl-CpG. This is consistent with the observation that densely methylated DNA associates with transcriptionally repressed chromatin characterized by the presence of underacetylated histones (36Antequera F. Macleod D. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 509-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 37Eden S. Hashimshony T. Keshet I. Cedar H. Thorne A.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 842Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Although the class I HDACs were shown to interact with MeCP2 via mSin3A (34Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2813) Google Scholar, 35Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar), other components that are required for the MeCP2-mediated repression remain elusive. Here we have studied the role of c-Ski in MeCP2-mediated transcriptional repression. We have found that c-Ski directly binds to MeCP2 and is required for the transcriptional repression mediated by MeCP2. GST pull-down assays were performed as described (4Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Human MeCP2 cDNA was obtained from S. Kudo (38Kudo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5492-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The GST-MeCP2, GST-c-Ski, and GST-N-CoR fusion proteins contained the full-length human MeCP2, full-length human c-Ski, and N-terminal 427 amino acids of the mouse N-CoR protein, respectively. Approximately 10 μg of the GST fusion protein was used per assay. For the in vitro translation of c-Ski, MeCP2, and N-CoR, various cDNA fragments were cloned into a pSPUTK vector (Stratagene) containing the SP6 promoter and the Xenopus β-globin 5′-untranslated region. YBB buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA) containing 150 mmNaCl was used for binding between MeCP2 and c-Ski, whereas YBB buffer containing 250 mm NaCl was used for binding between GST-N-CoR and the in vitro translated MeCP2. For the binding between GST-MeCP2 and the in vitro translated N-CoR, YBZB buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 μmZnCl2) containing 150 mm NaCl was used. To express the His tag-linked MeCP2 in Escherichia coli, the full-length MeCP2 cDNA was inserted into the pET vector containing six histidine residues. The His-MeCP2 proteins was expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3) and purified by the nickel-agarose column (Qiagen). For the binding of His-MeCP2 to GST-c-Ski and GST-N-CoR, YBB buffer containing 150 mm NaCl was used. The bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using the rabbit polyclonal anti-MeCP2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.), 293T cells were transfected with the FLAG-linked MeCP2 expression plasmid pact-FLAG-MeCP2 (1.5 μg) and the c-Ski expression plasmid pact-Ski (2.5 μg). Forty hours after transfection, the cells were disrupted by incubating with lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 μm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 1 h at 4 °C, and the lysates were prepared by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Ski antibody (Santa Cruz, N-20), anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma, M2), or mouse normal IgG after decreasing the NaCl concentration to 142 mm by addition of lysis buffer lacking NaCl. The immunocomplexes were used for Western blotting with anti-FLAG (Sigma, M5) or anti-Ski rabbit polyclonal antibodies (4Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, the lysates were prepared from 293 cells by homogenizer in buffer A (10 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture). The nuclei were isolated and extracted in buffer E (35 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 266 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 12.5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 80 μg/ml DNase I, 10 mm MnCl2, protease inhibitor mixture). The concentration of KCl was decreased to 152 mm by adding buffer E lacking KCl, ethidium bromide (50 μg/ml) was added to eliminate the contaminated DNA (39Lai J.-S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), and then immunoprecipitation was performed using the rabbit anti-MeCP2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) or rabbit normal IgG. The immunocomplexes were used for Western blotting with anti-c-Ski monoclonal antibodies. The FLAG-linked MeCP2 expression plasmid pact-FLAG-MeCP2 (0.9 μg) and the c-Ski expression plasmid (0.9 μg) were transfected into CV-1 cells. Immunostaining with anti-FLAG and anti-c-Ski antibodies and analysis by laser confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM510) were performed as described (4Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry of endogenous MeCP2 and c-Ski, 293 cells on coverslips were fixed by ice-cold acetone-methanol (1:1) for 10 min, treated with 10 mm sodium citrtate (pH 6.0), and then permeabilized by 0.2% Triton X-100 with phosphate-buffered saline for 12 min. After blocking (1.5% skim milk, 1.5% bovine serum albumin) for 3 h, the coverslips were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-MeCP2 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anti-c-Ski monoclonal antibodies for 6 h at 4 °C and then with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson), rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson) for 3 h at 4 °C. Finally the cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). Z series images were collected with 40× planApo objective fitted on a BX60 microscope (Olympus). The image stacks (spaced 0.4 μm apart) were deblurred by three-dimensional blind deconvolution with AutoDeblur software (AutoQuant Imaging, Inc.). The fusion protein consisting of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and the TRD of MeCP2 was expressed in a plasmid that was constructed using the cytomegalovirus promoter-containing vector. Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line was established from c-ski-deficient embryos (40Berk M. Desai S.Y. Heyman H.C. Colmenares C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2029-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) at 15.5 days post-coitus. Using LipofectAMINE PLUS, c-Ski-deficient MEFs (6 × 104 cells/6 well plate) were transfected with a mixture of the luciferase reporter containing the Gal4 sites and the thymidine kinase promoter (50 ng), the Gal4-MeCP2RD or Gal4 expression plasmid (0.01 ng), the cytoplasmic β-actin promoter-directed expression plasmid for mutant c-Ski (0, 6, or 30 ng), and the internal control plasmid pRL-TK (10 ng). Dual luciferase assays were then performed. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 260 ng by addition of the control plasmid DNA lacking the cDNA. To examine the endogenous c-Ski protein levels, nuclear extracts were prepared from wild-type and c-Ski-deficient MEFs as described by Schreiberet al. (41Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3921) Google Scholar) and used for Western blotting with the guinea pig polyclonal anti-c-Ski antibody. To investigate the c-Ski protein levels expressed from the transfected DNA, c-Ski-deficient MEFs (3 × 105 cells/10-cm dish) were transfected with a mixture of 0.6 μg of the c-Ski expression plasmid (pact-c-Ski) and 5.4 μg of the control plasmid DNA lacking the cDNA. The nuclear extracts were similarly prepared from the transfected cells and used for the Western blotting. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against bacterially expressed human c-Ski and SnoN were purified using antigen columns. The thymidine kinase promoter-directed expression plasmid for Gal4-MeCP2, which consists of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and full-length MeCP2, was used. Microinjection assays were performed using Rat-1 cells as described (4Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). MeCP2 interacts directly with the co-repressor mSin3A (34Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2813) Google Scholar, 35Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that other co-repressors, such as c-Ski, also directly bind to MeCP2. To investigate this, we first performed GST pull-down assays using the GST-MeCP2 fusion protein containing full-length MeCP2 (Fig.1). Wild-type c-Ski protein translatedin vitro efficiently bound to the GST-MeCP2 fusion (Fig. 1,A and B). To identify which region of c-Ski interacts with MeCP2, the GST pull-down assay was performed using various forms of in vitro translated c-Ski (Fig. 1,A and C). The results indicated that two regions in the c-Ski protein bind to MeCP2: the C-terminal coiled-coil region (amino acids 556–728) and a region overlapping the cysteine-rich N-CoR-binding domain (amino acids 197–330). To identify the specific region in the MeCP2 protein that interacts with c-Ski, we next performed similar GST pull-down assays using the GST-c-Ski fusion protein containing the full-length c-Ski (Fig.2). The 35S-MeCP2 translatedin vitro efficiently bound to the GST-c-Ski fusion. Truncation to amino acid 309 from the C terminus of MeCP2 did not affect the affinity of binding with c-Ski, whereas truncation to amino acid 162 almost completely eliminated the interaction with c-Ski. This suggests that the region containing the TRD is responsible for binding to c-Ski, because deletion of the TRD abolished the interaction with c-Ski, whereas the fragment containing the TRD efficiently bound to c-Ski. Thus, the TRD in MeCP2 interacts with c-Ski in the presence of reticulocyte lysates. The direct interaction between MeCP2 and the two co-repressors mSin3A and c-Ski raised the possibility that another co-repressor, N-CoR, might also interact directly with MeCP2. In fact, the in vitrotranslated N-CoR bound to the GST-MeCP2 (Fig.3 B, left panel). To identify the specific region in the N-CoR protein that interacts with MeCP2, we performed similar GST pull-down assays using GST-MeCP2 and various N-CoR fragments translated in vitro (Fig. 3). Only the N-terminal 427-amino acid fragment of N-CoR translated in vitro efficiently bound to GST-c-Ski, whereas other N-CoR fragments did not. Further, to identify which region of the MeCP2 protein interacts with N-CoR, we also performed the GST pull-down assays using the GST-N-CoR and a series of MeCP2 deletion mutants translated in vitro(Fig. 4). The results indicated that the broad region containing both the MBD and the TRD of MeCP2 (amino acids 55–309) is required for efficient interaction with N-CoR. Thus, MeCP2 interacts with three co-repressors: mSin3A, c-Ski, and N-CoR. The binding of MeCP2 with the two co-repressors, c-Ski and N-CoR, was shown using thein vitro translated proteins. However, it is possible that a protein in the reticulocyte lysates mediates an interaction between them. To confirm a direct interaction of MeCP2 with c-Ski and N-CoR, the His tag-linked MeCP2 protein was expressed in E. coli, purified, and used for the GST pull-down assay (Fig.5). The purified His-MeCP2 bound to both GST-c-Ski and GST-N-CoR containing the N-terminal 427-amino acid fragment of N-CoR. Addition of the reticulocyte lysates to the binding reactions slightly enhanced the affinity of His-MeCP2 with the GST-c-Ski and GST-N-CoR resins, suggesting the presence of co-factor(s) in the reticulocyte lysates that stimulate an interaction between them. These results indicate that MeCP2 directly binds to both c-Ski and N-CoR, and probably other co-repressor such as mSin3A in the reticulocyte lysates may enhance the interaction between them. The in vivo interaction between MeCP2 and the co-repressor c-Ski was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig.6). The expression vectors for both c-Ski and FLAG-linked MeCP2 were transfected into 293T cells, and whole cell lysates were prepared and used for co-immunoprecipitation. The antibody against c-Ski co-precipitated full-length MeCP2 but not the MeCP2 mutant lacking the TRD (MeCP2ΔTRD) (Fig. 6 A, left panel). The normal IgG control co-precipitated neither wild-type nor mutant MeCP2. When we used the anti-FLAG antibody for co-immunoprecipitation, wild-type c-Ski, but not the c-Ski mutant lacking the MeCP2-interacting regions (c-SkiΔ46–260/Δ493–728), was co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 6 A, right panel). Again, the normal IgG control co-precipitated neither wild-type nor mutant c-Ski. We also performed the co-immunoprecipitation experiments of endogenous c-Ski and MeCP2 proteins. Nuclear extracts prepared from 293 cells were immunoprecipitated with the antibodies against MeCP2 or normal IgG as a control (Fig. 6 B). c-Ski was co-immunopreciptated with the anti-MeCP2 antibodies but not with control IgG. Thus, the results of the co-immunoprecipitation assays indicate the presence of an in vivo association between c-Ski and MeCP2. To further confirm the in vivo association between c-Ski and MeCP2, we then examined the subcellular localization of c-Ski and MeCP2 in transfected CV-1 cells using laser confocal microscopy (Fig.7 A). As reported previously (4Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), c-Ski was localized in the nuclear dotlike structure when c-Ski alone was expressed (Fig. 7 A, panel a). On the other hand, wild-type MeCP2 signals were found in both the fine microspeckle structure and the foci with dim edges in the nucleus when MeCP2 alone was expressed (Fig. 7 A, panel b). As reported by Bird and co-workers (28Lewis J.D. Meehan R.R. Henzel W.J. Maurer-Fogy I. Jeppesen P. Klein F. Bird A. Cell. 1992; 69: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 42Nan X. Tate P. Li E. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), the MeCP2 signals matched the heterochromatin regions that were stained with Hoechst 33258 (data not shown). When c-Ski was co-expressed with wild-type MeCP2 (Fig.7 A, panels d–f), the nuclear dotlike structure of c-Ski was partly disrupted. The c-Ski signals were detected not only in the dotlike structures (arrows 1 and2 in the schematic in Fig. 7 A) but also in the fine microspeckles and in the island-like area (arrows 3 and4 in the schematic in Fig. 7 A). MeCP2 signals were also found in some of the dotlike structures (arrow 1) and a part of the island-like area (arrow 3). The island-like area containing MeCP2 (arrow 3) was shown to be the heterochromatin region that was positive for Hoechst 33258 staining (data not shown). Thus, c-Ski was recruited to the heterochromatin region by MeCP2, whereas c-Ski moved some of the MeCP2 proteins to the c-Ski-containing dotlike structure from the heterochromatin region. Furthermore, co-expression of c-Ski and MeCP2 changed the shape of heterochromatin region from a fine microspeckle structure and foci with dim edges to an island-like structure, although the mechanism of this transformation is unknown. We also used the mutant MeCP2 lacking the TRD as a control in the immunostaining study. This mutant protein was localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 7 A,panel c). This is consistent with the previous report that the sequence between amino acids 255–271 (RKAEADPQAIPKKRGRK) of the TRD of MeCP2 functions as a nuclear localization signal (42Nan X. Tate P. Li E. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the MeCP2 mutant lacking the TRD with c-Ski did not affect the nuclear dotlike structure of c-Ski (Fig. 7 A,panels g–i). These results strongly suggest an in vivo association between c-Ski and MeCP2 in the nucleus via the TRD of MeCP2. We also investigated the subcellular localization of the endogenous c-Ski and MeCP2 proteins in 293 cells using deconvolution microscopy. The endogenous c-Ski proteins were localized in the fine microspeckle structures in the nucleus and in the peripheral region of nuclei. The endogenous MeCP2 proteins were enriched in the heterochromatin region, which was positive for the Hoechst 33258 staining, and in the periphery of nuclei. Some of the c-Ski stainings overlapped with the MeCP2 staining, which was shown as the yellow color in the overlay of two signals. Thus, a significant amount of endogenous c-Ski associates with MeCP2 in the nuclei. The physical association between MeCP2 and c-Ski suggested that c-Ski may be required for the transcriptional repression mediated by MeCP2. To investigate this, we first examined the effect of overexpression of the putative dominant negative form of c-Ski on MeCP2-mediated repression in Ski-deficient MEFs (Fig.8 A). Small amounts of the Gal4-TRD fusion protein, which consists of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and the Ski-interacting domain of MeCP2 (amino acids 163–320), repressed transcription from a Gal4 site-containing reporter. This repression was probably mediated by the Sno protein in theSki-deficient MEFs. Overexpression of the c-Ski fragment (amino acids 556–728) linked to the nuclear localization signal of the SV40 T antigen (NLS-556–728) from the chicken cytoplasmic β-actin promoter, which contained the MeCP2-binding domain, abolished the Gal4-TRD-mediated repression as a dominant negative form. The c-Ski mutant, which lacked the MeCP2-binding domain (Δ46–260/Δ493–728) but contained the endogenous nuclear localization signal, did not affect the repression. Thus, the dominant negative form of c-Ski efficiently abrogated the MeCP2-mediated transcriptional repression. To indicate that the level of Ski expressed from the transfected DNA is not unusually high compared with endogenous c-Ski in wild-type MEFs, the Western blotting was performed (Fig. 8 A, bottom right panel). The density of c-Ski band obtained by using lysates from the transfected Ski-deficient MEFs was approximately half of that obtained with the lysates from wild-type MEFs. Because the transfection efficiency into MEFs was about 5%, the level of Ski protein expressed from the transfected DNA was about 10-fold higher than the level of endogenous c-Ski in wild-type MEFs. However, we used 4-fold more c-Ski expression plasmid to detect c-Ski in Western blotting assays compared with the amount of c-Ski expression plasmid used in the luciferase reporter assays described above (Fig.8 A). Therefore, the level of c-Ski proteins expressed from the transfected DNA in the luciferase reporter assays was about 2.5-fold higher than the level of endogenous c-Ski in wild-type MEFs, if the protein stability is similar between wild-type c-Ski and c-Ski fragments. To further confirm the role of c-Ski in the transcriptional repression mediated by MeCP2, microinjection experiments were performed using a Gal4-lacZ reporter containing Gal4-binding sites (Fig. 8 B). Injection of the reporter into Rat-1 cells gave rise to many lacZ-positive cells, whereas co-injection of the lacZ reporter with the plasmid encoding the Gal4-MeCP2, which consisted of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and full-length MeCP2, resulted in a decrease in the number of lacZ-positive cells. This decrease was partially reversed by co-injection with anti-c-Ski antibody or anti-Sno antibody. Furthermore, co-injection of both anti-c-Ski and anti-Sno antibodies almost completely abolished the Gal4-MeCP2-mediated decrease in the number of lacZ-positive cells. The specificity of the anti-c-Ski and anti-Sno antibodies used here has previously been shown; co-injection of the c-Ski and Sno expression vectors blocks the activity of these antibodies, but the antibodies do not affect the repression mediated by another repressor (δEF1) that does not use the Ski complex (4Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The results of co-transfection assays and the antibody injection assays indicate that c-Ski and Sno are required for the MeCP2-mediated transcriptional repression. An increasing number of molecules are understood to be involved in MeCP2-mediated transcriptional repression. Here, we have shown that c-Ski binds directly to MeCP2 and is necessary for its proper function. We have demonstrated that MeCP2 binds directly to two co-repressors, c-Ski and N-CoR. Because previous reports by Nan et al. (34Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2813) Google Scholar) and by Jones et al. (35Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar) showed that MeCP2 binds directly to mSin3A, our results bring the number of known co-repressors for MeCP2 to three. It is unlikely, however, that one macromolecular complex contains all three. Recent biochemical studies of the co-repressor complex indicate that the purified mSin3 complex contains neither N-CoR/SMRT nor c-Ski/Sno (12Zhang Y. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Cell. 1997; 89: 357-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 13Laherty C.D. Billin A.N. Lavinsky R.M. Yochum G.S. Bush A.C. Sun J.-M. Mullen T.-M.

Cell. 1998; 2: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and the N-CoR/SMRT complex involves neither mSin3 nor c-Ski/Sno as a component (7Huang E.Y. Zhang J. Miska E.A. Guenther M.G. Kouzarides T. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 45-54PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M.

Wang J. Nawaz Z. Liu J.M. Qin J. Wong J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Therefore, there are probably separate complexes for each of the co-repressors that may associate with MeCP2 either sequentially or at the same time. Although we found a strong interaction between c-Ski and MeCP2, it was somewhat surprising that the injection of antibodies against c-Ski and Sno almost completely abrogated the MeCP2-mediated transcriptional repression. Injection of the same antibodies only partially inhibits the repression mediated by Mad, thyroid hormone receptor-β, or Rb only partially (30–50%) (4Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 19Tokitou F. Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Yasukawa T. Kohno I. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4485-4488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This may suggest that the role of c-Ski/Sno is different depending on the repressor with which it interacts. When MeCP2 and c-Ski were both overexpressed, the location of each within the cell was affected (Fig. 7 A). The signal of endogenous MeCP2 proteins overlapped with the staining signal with Hoechst 33258, which indicates the heterochromatin (Fig.7 B). Localization of MeCP2 in the heterochromatin region is consistent with the fact that the heterochromatin contains a major satellite DNA sequence, which accounts for 25–50% of genomic 5-methylcytosine. In the heterochromatin region, the c-Ski signal was also observed, supporting the idea that c-Ski is involved in the MeCP2-mediated transcriptional repression. In addition to the inside region of nucleus, both endogenous c-Ski and MeCP2 are localized in the periphery of the nucleus, which is also positive for Hoechst 33258 staining (Fig. 7 B). This localization could be consistent with the recent report that the perinuclear chromatin domains contain the telomere and constitute areas of transcriptional repression in yeast (43Andrulis E.D. Neiman A.M. Zappulla D.C. Sternglanz R. Nature. 1998; 394: 592-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 44Galy V. Olivo-Marin J.C. Scherthan H. Doye V. Rascalou N. sNehrbass U. Nature. 2000; 403: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Although the ski gene was originally identified as an oncogene carried by avian Sloan-Kettering viruses (1Li Y. Turck C.M. Teumer J.K. Stavnezer E. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was recently reported that c-Ski binds directly to Smad proteins, which are key regulators in TGF-β signaling (45Sun Y Liu X. Eaton E.N. Lane W.S. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 46Luo K. Stroschein S, L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5924-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). c-Ski inhibits the TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation by recruiting the HDAC complex to Smad proteins. Therefore, ski may act in part as an oncogene by inhibiting TGF-β signaling in TGF-β-responsive cells. In addition to this mechanism, Ski may also enhance cellular proliferation by enhancing the methyl CpG-mediated silencing. The recent discovery of numerous hypermethylated promoters of tumor suppressor genes indicates that inactivation of tumor suppressor genes by DNA methylation is an important mechanism of tumor formation (for review, see Ref. 25Jones P.A. Laird P.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar). Therefore, overexpression of c-Ski may lead to silencing some tumor suppressor genes, resulting in cellular transformation. Our results indicate that c-Ski and Sno are needed for MeCP2-mediated transcriptional repression. This may suggest that the skigene family is also required for genome imprinting. We have investigated whether some imprinting genes such as H19 andIgf2 are ectopically expressed inski-deficient embryos because of reduction in methyl-CpG-dependent transcriptional repression. However, we found no difference in the expression levels of these genes between wild-type and ski-deficient embryos. 2I. Kanda, T. Shinagawa, and S. Ishii, unpublished results. This is consistent with the recent report that the hypermethylated genes such asMLH1 and TIMP3 cannot be transcriptionally reactivated with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (49Cameron E.E. Bachman K.E. Myohanen S. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). We are grateful to S. Kudo for the human MeCP2 cDNA."

We identified chick Ventroptin, an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4), which is mainly expressed in the ventral retina, not only with a ventral high–dorsal low gradient but also with a nasal high–temporal low gradient at later stages. Misexpression of Ventroptin altered expression patterns of several topographic genes in the retina and projection of the retinal axons to the tectum along both axes. Thus, the topographic retinotectal projection appears to be specified by the double-gradient molecule Ventroptin along the two axes."

The anti-apoptotic protein Bag-1 that exists in at least three translational initiation variants, Bag-1L, Bag-1M, and Bag-1S, received the most attention. Bag-1M was reported to induce ADP release by Hsc70 (13Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) similar to GrpE, the nucleotide exchange factor for the DnaK-type Hsp70 homologs of bacteria. However, such an analogous function for GrpE was discussed controversially as Bag-1M did not accelerate the dissociation of Hsp70·ADP or Hsp70·ATP complexes (17Bimston D. Song J. Winchester D. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6871-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Whether Bag-1M inhibited or stimulated the refolding of denatured substrates by Hsp70s in vitro andin vivo was also controversial (15Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S.-I. Freeman B.C.

All studies agree that Bag-1M stimulates the steady-state ATPase activity of Hsp70 and Hsc70. However, the extent of the stimulation varied largely (2–40-fold), acting synergistic or additive to Hdj-1, the major heat-inducible DnaJ-protein in mammalian cytosol (13Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 16Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17Bimston D. Song J.

In order to resolve these contradictions we investigated the influence of Bag-1M on nucleotide exchange, substrate release, ATPase, and chaperone activity of two cytosolic and nuclear Hsp70 homologs of human cells, Hsc70 and Hsp70, under identical conditions. Hsc70, Hsp70, Bag-1M, and Bag-1M-(151–274) were recombinantly expressed inΔdnaK52 Escherichia coli cells. Hsc70 and Hsp70 were purified according to the DnaK protocol (20Buchberger A. Schröder H. Büttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Bag-1M was purified as described (13Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar); Bag-1M-(151–274) was purified via DEAE-cellulose and SP-Sepharose columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hdj-1 was expressed in E. coli and purified according to the DnaJ protocol (21Schönfeld H.-J. Schmidt D. Zulauf M. Progr. Colloid Polym. Sci. 1995; 99: 7-10Crossref Google Scholar). Steady-state ATP hydrolysis rates were determined as described for DnaK (22Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Reactions were performed at 30 °C in mixtures containing buffer HKM (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2), 1 µm Hsc70 or Hsp70, 2 µm Hdj-1, 0–17.5 µm Bag-1M, 250 µm ATP, and 0.1 µCi of [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantification was performed as described (23Mayer M.P. Laufen T. Paal K. McCarty J.S. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Hsc70 (1 µm) and cochaperones (Hdj-1, 0.2 µm; Bag-1 as indicated) were incubated in HKM buffer supplemented with 5 mmdithiothreitol and 2 mm ATP for 5 min at 20 °C. Firefly luciferase (70 µm in 1 m glycylglycine, pH 7.4; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to 0.1 µmand denatured for 20 min at 42 °C. The refolding reaction (20 µl) was started by shifting back the temperature to 30 °C and addition of 5% rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and 2.5 mm ATP. At the indicated times, 1-µl aliquots were diluted into 125 µl of assay buffer and analyzed for bioluminescence activity in a Biolumat (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) as described (25Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.-U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of native luciferase diluted in refolding buffer containing Hsc70 (1 µm) and Hdj-1 (0.2 µm) and incubated at 30 °C was set to 100%. To determine the dissociation rates (k off) of ADP/ATP, the fluorescent labeled ADP/ATP analogsN 8-(4-N′-methylanthraniloylaminobutyl)-ADP/ATP (MABA-ADP/ATP)1 (10Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) were used. Hsc70/Hsp70 (0.5 µm) and MABA-ADP (0.5 µm) in HKM buffer were preincubated for 30 min at 30 °C and mixed 1:1 in a stopped-flow device (SX-18M Applied Photophysics, Surrey, UK) with a solution of 250 µmADP ± Bag-1M (0–90 µm). Fluorescence (excitation, 360 nm; cut-off filter at 420 nm) was measured for 1–200 s at 30 °C, and the time-dependent decrease was fitted to a single exponential decay. Where indicated 10 mmPi was added. ATP association was measured by mixing 0.25 µm MABA-ATP with different amounts of Hsc70/Hsp70. For the determination of ATP dissociation, MABA-ATP was mixed with Hsc70/Hsp70 for 30 s and subsequently mixed with unlabeled ATP ± Bag-1M in double-mixing experiments. To determine protein substrate release3H-labeled RCLMA was used. 10 µm Hsp70 or Hsc70 and 0.3 µm3H-RCLMA ± 20 µm Bag-1M were preincubated in 20 µl of T buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 200 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at 30 °C, ± 50 µmunlabeled RCLMA and ± 2.5 mm ATP were added, incubated for 1 min at 30 °C, and separated via a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine peptide substrate k off dansyl chloride (Molecular Probes)-labeled NR peptide (NRLLLTGC) was used (D-NR). Hsp70 (5 µm) and D-NR (2 µm) were preincubated in HKM buffer for 30 min at 30 °C and mixed 1:1 in a stopped-flow device (SX-18M Applied Photophysics, Surrey, UK) with 250 µm unlabeled NR ± 0.5 mm ATP ± 5 µm Bag-1M. Fluorescence (excitation, 334 nm; cut-off filter at 385 nm) was measured for 1–1000 s at 30 °C. To determine the rate constants a single or double exponential decay function was fitted to the time-dependent decrease in fluorescence. To determine the domain structure of Bag-1M a partial proteolytic digest with trypsin was performed. 18 µg of Bag-1M were incubated with 0.01 µg of trypsin at 30 °C for 0–30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. For analysis a 13% SDS gel was used. We wanted to investigate the effects of Bag-1M on nucleotide exchange of Hsc70 and Hsp70 by directly measuring nucleotide release. As nucleotide exchange is a rapid process for Hsc70, we intended to use the fluorescent ADP and ATP analogs MABA-ADP/ATP and stopped-flow instrumentation. These analogs were shown previously to have similar kinetic properties as their authentic counterparts in case of the E. coli homolog DnaK (10Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To verify the suitability of MABA-ADP and MABA-ATP for measuring Hsc70 and Hsp70 nucleotide exchange kinetics, we determined the mutual exchange rates of MABA-ADPversus ADP and MABA-ATP versus ATP. ADP and ATP exchange rates were independently measured using the intrinsic fluorescence of the single tryptophan that was shown to change in response to ATP binding (26Ha J.-H. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11635-11644Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27Buchberger A. Theyssen H. Schröder H. McCarty J.S. Virgallita G. Milkereit P. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16903-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The measured rates were very similar, and the fluorescent analogs were therefore suitable for the nucleotide exchange experiments. The MABA-ADP k off values determined for Hsc70 at 30 °C (0.24 s−1) were approximately 10-fold higher than published values for ADP release at 25 °C (TableI(28Ha J.-H. Hellman U. Johnson E.R. Li L.

Hsp70 had nearly identical MABA-ADP dissociation rates as Hsc70. For both chaperones, the addition of physiological concentrations of Pi (10 mm) decreased the dissociation rate by 5-fold (Table I).Table IAssociation and dissociation rates of MABA-ADP and MABA-ATPHsc70Hsp70k offADP(s−1)0.240.3k offADP+Pi(s−1)0.0460.05k off1ATP(s−1)0.20.78k off2ATP(s−1)0.010.06k onATP (m−1s−1)4.9 × 1051-aMeasured by tryptophan fluorescence at 18 °C, k on1 for MABA-ATP was 6.9 × 105m−1 s−1 at 30 °C.1.1 × 106k 2ATP(s−1)0.21-aMeasured by tryptophan fluorescence at 18 °C, k on1 for MABA-ATP was 6.9 × 105m−1 s−1 at 30 °C.ND1-bND, not determined.Dissociation of MABA-ADP was determined by rapidly mixing complexes of MABA-ADP and Hsc70 or Hsp70 with an excess of unlabeled ADP in a stopped-flow device.

Open table in a new tab Dissociation of MABA-ADP was determined by rapidly mixing complexes of MABA-ADP and Hsc70 or Hsp70 with an excess of unlabeled ADP in a stopped-flow device. For the determination of the MABA-ATP dissociation rate, MABA-ATP was first mixed with the nucleotide-free Hsc70/Hsp70 for 30 s and subsequently with an excess of unlabeled ATP in double mixing experiments. Association of MABA-ATP was measured by mixing MABA-ATP or unlabeled ATP with different concentrations of nucleotide-free Hsc70 or Hsp70. Single and double exponential equations were fitted to the change of fluorescence. We used MABA-ADP to determine directly the effects of Bag-1M on nucleotide release from Hsc70 and Hsp70. As evidenced by the differential decrease in fluorescence signal, Bag-1M stimulated the off-rate of MABA-ADP for Hsc70 (Fig. 1A) and Hsp70 (not shown) in the absence of Pi. Titrating the Bag-1M concentration and plotting the measured off-rates against the Bag-1M concentration resulted in a hyperbolic curve with an apparentK d and a maximal rate of 1.8 µm and 23 s−1 for Hsp70 and 3.9 µm and 24 s−1 for Hsc70, respectively (Fig. 1, B andC). This clearly demonstrates that Bag-1M is a nucleotide exchange factor for both cytosolic Hsp70 proteins investigated, stimulating the off-rate of MABA-ADP by up to 100-fold. Surprisingly, higher concentrations of Bag-1M were needed to reach similar stimulatory effects in the presence of physiological concentrations of Pi (10 mm). Under these conditions we were not able to reach saturation with the Bag-1M concentrations used, and the data could not be fitted by a hyperbolic function. Due to the 5-fold decreased basal k offfor ADP in the presence of Pi, the highest stimulation factors reached were 690- and 460-fold over the basal rate for Hsc70 and Hsp70, respectively. In order to compare these data with the previously studied E. coli DnaK system (29Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we performed a similar titration using the E. coli GrpE to measure DnaK-MABA-ADP dissociation. The data obtained were almost identical to those published (29Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) demonstrating that Pi does not affect the GrpE-stimulated ADP dissociation (not shown). We also investigated the association and dissociation of ATP using either MABA-ATP or tryptophan fluorescence. For both proteins the association and dissociation of ATP occurred in a two-step process as previously published for Hsc70 (26Ha J.-H. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11635-11644Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). MABA-ATP associated with Hsp70 with a 2-fold higher rate than with Hsc70. ATP association measured via tryptophan fluorescence yielded within the error range identical values (Table I). MABA-ATP dissociated from Hsp70 also in a two-step mechanism with the faster rate being 0.78 s−1 which is four times faster than the dissociation rate for MABA-ATP from Hsc70 (Table I). The slower rate, which most likely corresponds to an isomerization step that precedes dissociation, was for Hsp70 (0.06 s−1) even six times faster than for Hsc70 (0.01 s−1). The presence of Bag-1M even at high concentrations did not increase the apparent association and dissociation rates of MABA-ATP for either Hsp70 or Hsc70. The potent nucleotide exchange factor Bag-1M therefore differs from GrpE in as much as Pi influences the concentration necessary for half-maximal stimulation, and that Bag-1M discriminates between bound ADP and bound ATP. To identify the domain within Bag-1M that is responsible for the observed stimulation of the ADP dissociation by Hsc70 and Hsp70, we attempted to determine the domain structure of Bag-1M biochemically using partial proteolytic digestion. Tryptic digestion of Bag-1M produced a very stable 20-kDa fragment consisting of the C-terminal 124 residues (151) as determined by N-terminal sequencing and molecular weight (Fig. 2). We cloned and purified the corresponding fragment (Bag-1M-(151–274)) and investigated its effect on ADP dissociation by Hsc70/Hsp70. Previous work used sequence homology criteria to derive a Bag-1 fragment that was slightly longer (Bag-1M-(129–274) (14Lüders J. Demand J. Schönfelder S. Frien M. Zimmermann R. Höhfeld J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). The recently published crystal structure of a Bag-1 fragment in complex with Hsc70 as well as the recently published NMR structure of Bag-1 used fragments that were almost identical to our fragment (30Briknarova K. Takayama S. Brive L. Havert M.L. Knee D.A. Velasco J. Homma S. Cabezas E. Stuart J. Hoyt D.W. Satterthwait A.C. Llinas M. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. Nat. Struct.

Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Bag-1M-(151–274) catalyzed the ADP release by both Hsp70 proteins even more efficiently than the full-length Bag-1M protein. This was particularly apparent in the presence of Pi as demonstrated in Fig. 1 D for Hsc70. A hyperbolic function could be fitted to the data yielding K d values of 1 and 17 µm and a maximal rate of 20 and 42 s−1 (83- and 913-fold stimulation over basal dissociation rate) in the absence and presence of Pi, respectively. Comparison of theK d values with the value for full-length Bag-1M in absence of Pi (3.9 µm) revealed that the apparent affinity of the Bag-1M fragment was almost 4-fold higher. If the same were valid in the presence of Pi theK d for the full-length Bag-1M protein would be in the order of 70 µm. This would explain why these data points (see Fig. 1 B) seem to follow a linear dependence. The titration curves for Hsp70 were very similar (not shown). Taken together, the Bag-1 fragment stimulates nucleotide release by Hsp70 and Hsc70 even more efficiently than full-length Bag-1M. After having analyzed the influence of Bag-1M on nucleotide association and dissociation, we investigated its effect on the ATPase cycle. Measurement of the intrinsic ATPase rates yielded 2.48·10−3 s−1 and 4.5·10−4s−1 for Hsc70 and Hsp70, respectively. This is much slower than the ADP dissociation and the ATP association rates indicating that for both proteins ATP hydrolysis is rate-limiting for the ATPase cycle consistent with earlier publications for Hsc70 (28Ha J.-H. Hellman U. Johnson E.R. Li L. McKay D.B. Sousa M.C. Takeda S. Wernstedt C. Wilbanks S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27796-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Under these conditions Bag-1M should not have any effect on the steady-state ATPase rate. The DnaJ-protein Hdj-1 stimulated both Hsp70 proteins up to a maximal steady-state ATPase rate of 0.008 and 0.003 s−1for Hsc70 and Hsp70, respectively. Under single turnover conditions increasing concentrations of Hdj-1 stimulated the ATPase activity of both Hsp70 proteins to much higher rates of more than 0.03 s−1 (not shown), demonstrating that in the presence of Hdj-1 ATP hydrolysis is not more rate-limiting for the ATPase cycle. Therefore, in the presence of Hdj-1, acceleration of nucleotide exchange by Bag-1M should stimulate the overall steady-state ATPase rate. We therefore determined the steady-state ATPase rates for Hsc70 and Hsp70 in the presence of high concentrations of Hdj-1 (2 µm) and titrated the Bag-1M concentration (1–15 µm). In the case of Hsc70, Bag-1M stimulated the ATPase rate as expected up to 2-fold over the rate in the absence of Bag-1M which is 20-fold over the basal rate (Fig. 3). These data are consistent with previously published data (13Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, in the case of Hsp70 a cooperative stimulation of the ATPase activity by Hdj-1 and Bag-1 was only observed at very high concentrations of Bag-1M despite the fact that nucleotide release from Hsp70 was stimulated by Bag-1M at least as efficiently as for Hsc70 (Fig. 3). Experiments using the C-terminal fragment of Bag-1M yielded similar results except that lower concentrations of the fragment compared with the full-length protein were necessary for the stimulation and that higher maximal rates were observed (not shown). These experiments demonstrate that Hdj-1 and Bag-1M cooperatively stimulate the ATPase cycles of Hsc70 and Hsp70 with marked differences in the required Bag-1M concentrations for the two Hsp70 homologs. The activity of Bag-1M to stimulate nucleotide dissociation from Hsc70 and Hsp70 conceivably allows ATP to bind to the nucleotide-free form of the chaperone and, consequently, is expected to trigger the release of any bound substrate. However, based on native gel electrophoresis data, Bag-1M was proposed to uncouple nucleotide exchange and substrate release (17Bimston D. Song J. Winchester D. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6871-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We used gel filtration to determine the amount of complex of Hsc70 or Hsp70 with tritiated, reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin ([3H]RCMLA) as substrate after addition of ATP in the absence or presence of Bag-1M. Unlabeled RCMLA was added together with ATP to prevent rebinding of the tritiated substrate. 1 min after the addition of ATP the amount of Hsc70- or Hsp70-bound [3H]RCMLA was significantly reduced (Fig. 4). This reduction was enhanced and not prevented by Bag-1M. However, when the quench RCMLA was omitted a significant amount of [3H]RCMLA was found in complex with Hsc70 and Hsp70, indicating rebinding of the released substrate. To resolve the influence of Bag-1M on the dissociation of the Hsc70·substrate complex kinetically, we used the fluorescent labeled peptide substrate D-NR (dansyl-NRLLLTGC). This peptide bound to Hsp70·ADP with high affinity, and binding was detectable by an increase of the dansyl fluorescence at 526 nm. Mixing the complex of D-NR and Hsp70·ADP with an excess of unlabeled peptide led to a decrease in fluorescence at a rate of 3.9·10−3s−1 which is consistent with substrate dissociation rates measured for peptides and other Hsp70 homologs in the ADP state (3Schmid D.

The addition of ATP to the Hsp70·ADP·D-NR complex accelerated the dissociation of D-NR to 0.43 s–1 which is similar to the ADP dissociation rate, indicating that nucleotide exchange is rate-limiting for substrate release under these conditions. Addition of Bag-1M in the absence of ATP did not influence the dissociation rate of the peptide. However, in the presence of ATP, Bag-1M accelerated the dissociation of the peptide significantly to 2.48 s–1 (Fig. 5). This value is identical to the dissociation rate of the Hsp70·D-NR complex in the presence of ATP when nucleotide-free preparations of Hsp70 are used (Table II). This clearly demonstrates that Bag-1M accelerates substrate release by accelerating nucleotide exchange. Our data suggest that Bag-1M acts as a substrate unloading factor for Hsc70 and Hsp70.Table IIEffect of Bag-1M on the dissociation of the Hsp70·substrate complexHsp70/D-NRk offs−1Hsp70ADP2-aHsp70ADP is Hsp70 with bound ADP.3.9 × 10−32-bKinetics followed a single exponential curve.Hsp70ADP + Bag-13.85 × 10−32-bKinetics followed a single exponential curve.Hsp70ADP + ATP0.43/0.042-cKinetics followed a double exponential curve; both rates are given.Hsp70ADP + ATP/Bag-12.48/0.232-cKinetics followed a double exponential curve; both rates are given.Hsp70Nu2-dHsp70Nu is nucleotide-free Hsp70. + ATP2.46/0.202-cKinetics followed a double exponential curve; both rates are given.Hsc70·D-NR complexes were rapidly mixed in a stopped-flow instrument with unlabeled NR and Bag-1 ± ATP as indicated.

To analyze the regulatory influence of Hdj-1 and Bag-1M on the chaperone activity of Hsc70 and Hsp70, we measured refolding of heat-denatured firefly luciferase. For Hsc70 and Hsp70 we first titrated Hdj-1 to determine the optimal ratios for luciferase refolding (not shown). For both systems, Hsp70/Hdj-1 and Hsc70/Hdj-1, we then titrated Bag-1M in the absence and in the presence of Piand measured the initial rate of luciferase refolding. In the absence of Pi, Hsp70 and Hsc70 in combination with Hdj-1 refolded up to 60% of denatured luciferase within 1 h (Fig.6A). Addition of increasing concentrations of Bag-1M or Bag-1M-(151–274) decreased significantly the rate and the yield of luciferase refolding as previously observed by different laboratories (13Höhfeld J.

https://openalex.org/W2016869521,"We previously cloned and characterized thyroid hormone receptor-binding protein (TRBP) as an LXXLL-containing general coactivator that associates with coactivator complexes through its C terminus. To identify protein cofactors for TRBP action, a Sos-Ras yeast two-hybrid cDNA library was screened using TRBP C terminus as bait. A novel coactivator was isolated, coactivator activator (CoAA), that specifically associates with TRBP. Human CoAA is composed of 669 amino acids with a TRBP-interacting domain and two highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRM) commonly found in ribonucleoproteins. A splice variant lacking the entire TRBP-interacting domain was also isolated as a coactivator modulator (CoAM), a 156-amino acid protein containing only the RRM region. Human CoAA and CoAM mRNAs are encoded by a single gene located on chromosome 11q13; alternative splicing in exon 2 of CoAA yields CoAM. CoAA interacts with both TRBP and p300 in vitro. In addition, CoAA potently coactivates transcription mediated by multiple hormone-response elements and acts synergistically with TRBP and CREB-binding protein (CBP). Furthermore, CoAA is associated with the DNA-dependent protein kinase-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase complex. Strikingly, CoAM, which lacks a TRBP-interacting domain, strongly represses both TRBP and CBP action suggesting that CoAM may modulate endogenous CoAA function. These data suggest that CoAA may serve as a mediator of coactivators such as TRBP in gene activation. We previously cloned and characterized thyroid hormone receptor-binding protein (TRBP) as an LXXLL-containing general coactivator that associates with coactivator complexes through its C terminus. To identify protein cofactors for TRBP action, a Sos-Ras yeast two-hybrid cDNA library was screened using TRBP C terminus as bait. A novel coactivator was isolated, coactivator activator (CoAA), that specifically associates with TRBP. Human CoAA is composed of 669 amino acids with a TRBP-interacting domain and two highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRM) commonly found in ribonucleoproteins. A splice variant lacking the entire TRBP-interacting domain was also isolated as a coactivator modulator (CoAM), a 156-amino acid protein containing only the RRM region.

A number of coactivators have been isolated and characterized. These include the general cointegrator CBP1/p300 (1Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G.

Multiple transcription factor-interacting domains were first discovered in CBP/p300. Subsequently, the LXXLL motifs that mediate ligand-dependent nuclear receptor interaction were found in many coactivators including the SRC-1 family, PGC-1 and TRBP. Amplification of genes encoding coactivators AIB1 (SRC-3) and AIB3 (TRBP/ASC-2/RAP250/PRIP/NRC) has been observed in assorted cancers (9Lee S.K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.E. Bubendorf L. Guan X.Y. Jung Y.K.

Histone acetyltransferase is another important activity present in many but not all coactivators, whereas arginine transmethylase in SRA and the RNA recognition motif (RRM) in PGC-1 are other functional domains potentially important for coactivator function (5Monsalve M.

However, the mechanism by which coactivators regulate target genes with pol II-containing transcriptional machinery is still poorly understood. It is conceivable that a multifunctional coactivator complex is required to integrate input from many sources in this process. However, substantial, if not conclusive, evidence derived from nuclear structure sheds light on our understanding of this process (for reviews see Refs. 14Barrett T.J. Spelsberg T.C. Vitam.

Science. 1998; 280: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase II (pol II) complexes, as detected by association with newly synthesized mRNA, are relatively immobile and morphologically recognizable as discrete foci in cell nucleus (18Cook P.R. Science. 1999; 284: 1790-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptors and their coactivators, in contrast, are mobile and migrate or relocate during transcription activation. Activation or repression of a gene is correlated with its movement between different zones or locations inside the nucleus (19Lamond A.I. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1998; 280: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). In addition, such changes in its localization in the nucleus are correlated with various physiological events such as hormone induction, apoptosis, and spermatogenesis (20Biggiogera M. Pellicciari C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 828-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that coactivators serve to recruit the cofactor-bound gene to the territory of pol II machinery rather than vice versa. On the other hand, mRNA synthesis and mRNA processing are colocalized and are apparently functionally coupled within the same transcription complex, which is composed largely of nuclear RNAs that associate with nuclear ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) (21Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 22Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin.

The distribution of nuclear RNPs has recently been shown to play an important role in transcription. Thus, identification of the components of the transcriptional machinery that are responsible for the action of coactivators is critical. Our efforts have focused on coactivator function and have taken advantage of our work with the general coactivator TRBP. TRBP is a high molecular weight (2063 amino acids), ubiquitously expressed coactivator (8Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5048-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although devoid of intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, TRBP can recruit this activity by associating with CBP/p300 (8Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Lee S.K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.E. Bubendorf L. Guan X.Y. Jung Y.K. Kallioniemi O.P. Kononen J. Trent J.M. Azorsa D. Jhun B.H.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5048-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). TRBP not only enhances nuclear receptor-mediated transcription but also stimulates the activities of multiple transcriptional factors including AP-1 and NFκB (8Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Lee S.K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.E. Bubendorf L. Guan X.Y. Jung Y.K. Kallioniemi O.P. Kononen J. Trent J.M.

The TRBP gene is also amplified in human breast and other cancers (9Lee S.K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.E. Bubendorf L. Guan X.Y. Jung Y.K. Kallioniemi O.P. Kononen J. Trent J.M. Azorsa D. Jhun B.H.

Unlike the cointegrator CBP/p300, which is composed of multiple protein-interacting domains, TRBP is composed largely of activation domains that are also found in proteins such as VP16, CBP, or SRC-1 (24Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In addition, the C terminus of TRBP has been shown to interact with nuclear DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) complexes that are implicated in transcription regulation (8Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These data suggest that TRBP might be targeted to the transcriptional complex via its C terminus. Thus, we searched for TRBP-interacting proteins by a yeast two-hybrid screen using TRBP C terminus as bait. We report here the isolation and characterization of a coactivator activator (CoAA) and its splice variant coactivator modulator (CoAM). CoAA stimulates transcription through its interactions with TRBP and RNA-containing transcriptional complexes. CoAM, which is unable to interact with TRBP, competes with CoAA and modulates CoAA function. Both CoAA and CoAM contain conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and thus may belong to the RNP family, which structurally and functionally may serve as integral components of the transcriptional machinery. Mouse CBP, p300, human TRBP and its derived plasmids have been described previously (8Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Full-length human CoAA and CoAM were generated by PCR and inserted into theHindIII/XhoI sites of pcDNA3. GST-CoAA (aa 307–584) and GST-CoAM were subcloned intoEcoRI/XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter luciferase reporter was generated by inserting MMTV promoter withHindIII/BglII sites into PXP2 vector. pCMV-TRβ1, pCMV-ERα, F2/TRE, and 2×ERE luciferase reporters were described previously (8Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A 2× GRE reporter was generated by PCR with NheI/XbaI sites of pTAL-Luc (CLONTECH). pCMV-GR was generated by inserting GR into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The 7×AP-1 and 5×NFκB luciferase reporters and MEK kinase (MEKK) plasmids were obtained from Stratagene. The Sos-Ras yeast two-hybrid system was described previously (25Aronheim A. Zandi E.

Human TRBP-C (aa 1641–2063) was inserted in-frame with the C terminus of human Sos as bait for screening a rat pituitary cDNA library (25Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). A partial rat cDNA containing the TRBP-interacting region was isolated, and human sequence information was obtained from GenBankTM. Based on the human sequence data, a full-length cDNA encoding human CoAA was isolated by 5′- and 3′-RACE using HeLa mRNA. Human CoAM was obtained by RT-PCR according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). The primers used for RT-PCR are as follows: F1, gactgccggtcgtcggacgtc; F2, tgcctgtcgctggaggagagg; F3, aaggtggctgcggcgacaaaatg; F4, aagatattcgtgggcaacgt; bib1, cgcagatctagagccagtagcaagat; bib2, acaaagtaggttactgccgaacact; bib3, cccacatggtagagggcatgaa; bib4, gggtggggagaggcgggtacg; and bib5, ggtcggaaccatacccttggt. The human CoAA gene structure was obtained by comparison of cDNA and genomic DNA sequences derived from GenBankTM using the BLAST htg search. Introns and spliced regions were identified by comparison of gene and cDNA sequences and noting the presence of GT-AG consensus sequence. The GST and GST fusion proteins (TRBP-C, CoAA, and CoAM) were produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vitro binding assays were performed by incubating GST resin (20 μl, 2 μg) and [35S]methionine-labeled, in vitro translated proteins (5 μl) produced by rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). Proteins were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Bound proteins were washed 3 times with binding buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For Ku70 and PARP interaction studies, GST resin was incubated with 200 μl of GH3 nuclear extract at 4 °C for 16 h in the binding buffer as above with additional 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor. Bound proteins were detected by Western blotting (ECL). Anti-Ku86 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from NeoMarkers and anti-PARP monoclonal antibody from Transduction Laboratories. Human multiple tissue and human cancer cell line Northern blots were obtained fromCLONTECH. The CoAA probe was prepared with random-primed 32P-labeled CoAA cDNA (aa 307–584). Northern analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 μg/μl penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were plated in 24-well plates 2 days before transfection. CV-1 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were incubated with fresh medium containing the indicated concentrations of ligands 16–24 h after transfection. After another 24 h, cells were harvested, and luciferase activities were determined as described (8Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Total amounts of DNA for each well were equalized by adding vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Data are shown as means of triplicate transfections ± S.E. The nuclear receptor coactivator TRBP has been shown previously to be a potent general coactivator that stimulates transcription mediated by multiple hormone-response elements. Further evidence suggested that the C terminus of TRBP may interact with protein complexes involved in the transcription machinery. In order to identify protein factors that directly associate with TRBP, a rat pituitary cDNA library was screened with a modified Sos-Ras yeast two-hybrid system using the C terminus of TRBP (aa 1641–2063) as bait. In a temperature-sensitive yeast strain (Cdc 25), protein-protein interactions activate the Ras pathway resulting in yeast survival at the restrictive temperature. Thus, protein interactions can be detected by proliferation of yeast (25Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 26Hubsman M. Yudkovsky G. Aronheim A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e18Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A partial rat cDNA was isolated that encodes a TRBP-interacting protein that interacts specifically with TRBP in yeast (Fig.1). When this rat cDNA sequence was compared with sequences from GenBankTM, the presence of a previously uncharacterized and related human cDNA was revealed. Based on the human data, the full-length human cDNA was obtained employing 5′- and 3′-RACE with mRNA from HeLa cells. Further RT-PCR analysis revealed an additional shorter splice variant. Based on their functional characteristics described below, we designated the full-length clone as coactivator activator, CoAA, and the short splice variant as coactivator modulator, CoAM. The CoAA cDNA contains 2781 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 669 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 69 kDa (Fig.2). CoAA belongs to the family of RNA-binding proteins because of the presence of two well characterized RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) within its N terminus (aa 3–68 and 81–144) (Figs. 2 and 3 A). Each of the RRMs is composed of two conserved RNP-1 and RNP-2 consensus motifs (Fig. 3 B). The crystal structure of RRM has suggested (28Shamoo Y. Krueger U. Rice L.M. Williams K.R. Steitz T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Nagai K. Oubridge C. Ito N. Avis J. Evans P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 235-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) that the RRM motif consists of four anti-parallel β-strands and two α-helices that collectively serve as an RNA binding platform. In addition, CoAA also contains a TRBP-interacting domain (aa 307–584) outside the RNA recognition motif (Figs. 2 and 3). Rat and human primary sequences of these regions have 98% identity. The primary sequence of the TRBP-interacting domain of CoAA is serine-, alanine-, glycine-, and tyrosine-rich, and the secondary structure analyzed by the program Jpred/PHD predicts mostly coiled coil structure, an uncharacterized feature shared among many coactivator molecules. Interestingly, a unique XYXXQ motif (Xdenotes a small amino acid residue including G, A, S, and P) is present with >20 copies throughout the domain. The function of this motif remains to be further elucidated. However, evidence suggests that the interspersed aromatic residue repeats among the small residues are important for protein-protein interactions between hnRNP proteins (33Cartegni L. Maconi M. Morandi E. Cobianchi F. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,34Biamonti G. Ruggiu M. Saccone S. Della Valle G. Riva S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1996-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This also implies that the entire TRBP-interacting region may be a single functional domain. Thus, the XYXXQ motif might be important for the interaction between TRBP and CoAA.Figure 3Comparison of CoAA and CoAM.A, schematic representation of CoAA and CoAM structures in which RRMs are shown as hatched boxes and the TRBP-interacting domain as a black box. The diagram illustrates the region missing in CoAM when compared with CoAA (aa 150–602).

Comparison of CoAA and CoAM sequences indicates the absence of nucleotides 544–1897 in CoAM relative to CoAA cDNA and suggests an alternative splicing of the primary transcript (Fig. 2). The splicing event results in the absence of the TRBP-interacting domain in CoAM (Fig. 2 and 3 A). The boundaries of the spliced nucleotide sequence present in CoAA were flanked by consensus splice acceptor and donor GT-AG sequences. This splicing event generates a frameshift at amino acid 150 with the subsequent early termination of translation (Fig. 2). The deduced protein sequence of CoAM contains 156 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 17 kDa. It mostly contains the two RNA recognition motifs that are shared with CoAA. The cDNA sequences obtained by 5′- and 3′-RACE were used to identify the human CoAA/CoAM genomic sequences from the GenBankTM htg data base. The human CoAA/CoAM gene is located on chromosome 11q13 and contains three exons spanning ∼11 kilobase pairs (Fig.3 C). Alternative splicing of exon 2 (cDNA nucleotides 544–1897) results in the lack of the TRBP-interacting domain and the formation of CoAM-encoding mRNA. Hence, CoAM is largely composed of two RRM domains. Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that CoAM is a naturally occurring splice variant and not a PCR artifact. First, several different primer sets yielded nine CoAM RT-PCR products derived from HeLa cell mRNA that correctly corresponded to their predicted sizes, suggesting the RT-PCR results of CoAM were not accidental (Fig.4, A and B). Second, comparison of the sequences derived from 3′- and 5′-RACE of CoAA with the RT-PCR results for CoAM reveals that the splice site is flanked by splice donor and acceptor consensus GT-AG at nucleotides 544–1897 of the CoAA cDNA sequence (Fig. 2). Third, alternative splicing at nucleotide 1897 corresponds precisely to the splice site at the boundary of the intron and exon 3 when genomic sequence was compared, consistent with alternative splicing at nucleotide 1897 as a naturally occurring event (Fig. 3 C). Fourth, the same CoAM sequence was obtained from different sources of human tissues including ovary and liver (Fig. 4 C). Finally, a primer crossing the junction of the splice site (B5), which only hybridizes with CoAM but not CoAA, was able to detect the CoAM sequence by RT-PCR (Fig.4 C). All together, these data demonstrate that CoAM is a naturally existing transcript. In vitro GST pull-down analyses were performed with recombinant GST fusion proteins and [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated proteins. Six GST-TRBP fragments were generated in order to map the region(s) required for CoAA interaction (Fig.5 A). The TRBP C terminus (aa 1242–2063 and 1641–2063) and the LXXLL-containing region (aa 719–999), but not GST alone or other regions of TRBP, interacts with CoAA (Fig. 5 B). Although the interaction between CoAA and the TRBP LXXLL-containing region was unexpected, CoAA did strongly interact with the TRBP C-terminal regions present in both TRBP-5 and TRBP-6. In addition, this interaction was CoAA-specific since CoAM did not interact with TRBP under the same conditions (Fig.5 B). The protein domain(s) involved in the interaction with CoAA is currently unknown. Thus, it is unclear whether multiple CoAA-interacting domains might be present in TRBP. However, the data were consistent with the yeast assay showing that the TRBP C terminus is capable of interacting with CoAA (Fig. 1). Similar positive interaction results were also obtained when GST-CoAA (Fig.5 C, left panels) or GST-CoAM (Fig. 5 C,right panels) was used together with in vitrotranslated TRBP-6. Luciferase served as a negative control, which did not bind to either. Furthermore, CoAA was able to interact with p300 (Fig. 5 D). The interaction of CoAA with p300 requires the C-terminal region of p300. These results suggested that CoAA directly interacts with coactivator TRBP and CBP/p300 in vitro. CoAM, which contains the two RNA recognition motifs but not the TRBP-interacting domain, was not able to bind to TRBP. This indicates that the major C-terminal region of CoAA, which includes the TRBP-interacting domain and is composed of multipleXYXXQ motifs, is largely responsible for the interaction between TRBP and CoAA. We examined the expression pattern of endogenous CoAA mRNA using human Northern blots containing different tissues and cell lines. The blots were probed with a cDNA encoding the CoAA-specific TRBP-interacting domain. A predominant 3.0-kilobase pair transcript was detected, which was present in all the human tissues tested including brain, heart, skeletal muscle, colon, thymus, spleen, kidney, liver, small intestine, placenta, lung, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (Fig.6). CoAA was also present at comparable levels in HL-60, HeLa, K-562, MOLT-4, Raji, SW480, A549, and G-361 human cancer cells (Fig. 6). As general coactivat"

They show maximum arc-normal contraction of a few millimeters as well as maximum subsidence of 1 to 2 centimeters, both in March. In northeastern Japan, it snows heavily on the western flank of the backbone range, attaining a maximum depth of several meters in March. When observed snow depths were compared with the load distribution estimated from the GPS data, the surface loads caused by the snow were found to be largely responsible for the annual displacement of GPS sites. The snow load modulates secular strain buildup in northeastern Japan due to the Pacific Plate subduction, but its relevance to the seasonal change of earthquake occurrences remains uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W2040382520,"The enzyme ThiI is common to the biosynthetic pathways leading to both thiamin and 4-thiouridine in tRNA. We earlier noted the presence of a motif shared with sulfurtransferases, and we reported that the cysteine residue (Cys-456 of Escherichia coli ThiI) found in this motif is essential for activity (Palenchar, P. M., Buck, C. J., Cheng, H., Larson, T. J., and Mueller, E. G. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 8283–8286). In light of that finding and the report of the involvement of the protein IscS in the reaction (Kambampati, R., and Lauhon, C. T. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 16561–16568), we proposed two mechanisms for the sulfur transfer mediated by ThiI, and both suggested possible involvement of the thiol group of another cysteine residue in ThiI. We have now substituted each of the cysteine residues with alanine and characterized the effect on activity in vivo and in vitro. Cys-108 and Cys-202 were converted to alanine with no significant effect on ThiI activity, and C207A ThiI was only mildly impaired. Substitution of Cys-344, the only cysteine residue conserved among all sequenced ThiI, resulted in the loss of function in vivo and a 2700-fold reduction in activity measured in vitro. We also examined the possibility that ThiI contains an iron-sulfur cluster or disulfide bonds in the resting state, and we found no evidence to support the presence of either species. We propose that Cys-344 forms a disulfide bond with Cys-456 during turnover, and we present evidence that a disulfide bond can form between these two residues in native ThiI and that disulfide bonds do form in ThiI during turnover.

Barnhart L.E. Paulson J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) shortly after Downs and co-workers (26Webb E. Claas K. Downs D.M. J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) isolated another enzyme, IscS, that sufficed along with ThiI forin vitro generation of s4U in tRNA, and they have since confirmed (28Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol.

IscS is a NifS-like protein that functions in iron-sulfur cluster formation, is PLP-dependent, and proceeds through an enzymic persulfide intermediate (29Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Zheng L.M. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Based on sequence alignments that revealed similarity between the segment of ThiI around Cys-456 and other sulfurtransferases, we investigated the importance of Cys-456 for the function of ThiI and found that C456A ThiI was inactive both in vivo and in vitro (31Palenchar P.M. Buck C.J. Cheng H. Larson T.J. Mueller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8283-8286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The report of the role of IscS in s4U biosynthesis fit nicely with our independent conclusion that ThiI would proceed through a persulfide intermediate on Cys-456 by providing a source of S0 to form that persulfide group. Since our report, Kambampati and Lauhon (32Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10727-10730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have established that sulfur flows from cysteine to IscS to ThiI to s4U in tRNA. Based on all the evidence, we proposed two alternative mechanisms for the biosynthesis of s4U (Fig.2), and both immediately suggest a role for another cysteine residue in ThiI (31Palenchar P.M.

E. coli ThiI has four cysteine residues other than Cys-456, and sequence alignments of known ThiI proteins (all from prokaryotes) reveal that only one cysteine residue, Cys-344 in the E. coli enzyme, is completely conserved, 3P. Palenchar and E. Mueller, unpublished observations.3P. Palenchar and E. Mueller, unpublished observations.suggesting that this amino acid serves a critical role.

The complete sequences of all plasmids described in this publication are posted at www.udel.edu/chem/mueller. To substitute cysteine residues in ThiI with alanine, the QuikChangeTM mutagenesis protocol was used with appropriate primers (TableI) as we described previously (34Ramamurthy V. Swann S.L.

All of the ThiI variants described in this paper contain the 20-amino acid N-terminal His6 tag provided by pET15b, but all amino acid positions are numbered in terms of native ThiI (with no N-terminal His6 tag). The parent plasmid was pBH113S, which has N49S thiI in pET15b; as described previously (31Palenchar P.M. Buck C.J. Cheng H. Larson T.J. Mueller E.G. J. Biol.

The primers are broken into codons (upper primer) or their complements (lower primer), and the changed bases are underlined. The restriction sites specified by the primers for the cloning ofiscS are shown in italics. The overexpression, purification, and storage of each altered ThiI was accomplished using the methods that we have described in detail elsewhere (35Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2424-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the growth medium, and the cells were harvested 3 h later. Chromatography of cell extracts over Ni-NTA resin yielded essentially homogeneous ThiI, which was changed into appropriate buffer and used immediately or precipitated by addition of solid ammonium sulfate (to nominal 75% saturation) for storage at 4 °C. By using the methods that we have described elsewhere (35Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2424-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), extinction coefficients at 280 nm were determined, and far-UV CD spectra were recorded for each altered ThiI. The generation, isolation, and properties of the C456A ThiI have been described previously (31Palenchar P.M. Buck C.J. Cheng H. Larson T.J. Mueller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8283-8286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The effect of substituting the cysteine residues of ThiI on its activity in vivo was assessed in two ways. First, the thiI mutant VJS2890(DE3) was transformed with a plasmid encoding an altered ThiI, and the transformants were subjected to near-UV screening. The screening of cells producing each altered ThiI was performed twice, except for the cells expressing C202A and C207A ThiI, which were performed four times; qualitatively identical results were obtained in every case. Second, the UV spectrum of tRNA isolated from saturated cultures of the transformants was recorded and examined for the characteristic peak due to s4U (λmax ∼334 nm). The procedures for both of these in vivocharacterizations have been described in detail elsewhere (25Mueller E.G. Buck C.J. Palenchar P.M. Barnhart L.E. Paulson J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This assay is essentially the one that we have described previously (31Palenchar P.M. Buck C.J. Cheng H. Larson T.J. Mueller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8283-8286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) except that recombinant IscS·His6 was substituted for cell extracts. The generation of s4U was monitored by following the incorporation of 35S into s4U froml-[35S]cysteine. A typical assay mixture (350 μl) was 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing ATP (4 mm), pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (40 μm), magnesium chloride (5 mm), in vitro transcript of E. coli tRNAPhe (20 μm),l-[35S]cysteine (484 μm; 123 μCi/μmol), DTT (1 mm), IscS·His6 (4 nm), and ThiI (1 nm). For the C344A ThiI, the assays contained higher concentrations of the proteins, 4.8 μm IscS·His6 and 1.2 μm C344A ThiI. Reactions were initiated by the addition of recombinant ThiI and incubated at 37 °C. At various times, aliquots (100 μl) were removed, and [35S]s4U was quantitated by the method that we have described in detail elsewhere (31Palenchar P.M. Buck C.J. Cheng H. Larson T.J. Mueller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8283-8286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this method, unreacted l-[35S]cysteine is removed by size-exclusion chromatography, and the tRNA is digested to nucleosides, which are resolved by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (36Gehrke C.W.

Biochem. 1983; 129: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); the level of 35S in the s4U is determined by in-line scintillation counting. Genomic DNA was purified from E. coli JM109 cells (Promega) using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification protocol (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification of iscS in the genomic DNA was achieved using appropriate primers (Table I), Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), and HotStart tubes (Molecular Bio-Products Inc., San Diego) according to the HotStart protocol. The primers (Table I) specified an NdeI site that includes the start ATG ofiscS and an EcoRI site that follows the TAA that terminates iscS. A Robocyler Gradient 96 thermal cycler (Stratagene) was used for the PCR, as described elsewhere (25Mueller E.G. Buck C.J. Palenchar P.M. Barnhart L.E. Paulson J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and recovered using the QIAquick gel extraction protocol (Qiagen). The isolated PCR product was ligated into pGEM-T using the pGEM-T Easy Vector System II (Promega) as specified by the manufacturer, and restriction analysis confirmed the generation of the target plasmid. This plasmid was digested with NdeI and EcoRI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and the iscS fragment was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into pET29b (Novagen) that had been opened with the same enzymes. The success of the construction was confirmed by restriction analysis, and the plasmid was named pBH400. Sequencing of iscS in pBH400 revealed two discrepancies from the published sequence as follows: a T → C transition in codon 244 that results in the substitution of proline for leucine and a deletion of the T in the penultimate codon that moves the stop codon specified by the “reverse” PCR primer out of frame and brings the C-terminal His6 tag encoded by pET29b into frame. IscS bearing the C-terminal His6 tag will be denoted IscS·His6. Both alterations of iscS in pBH400 were corrected using the QuikChangeTM protocol (Stratagene) with appropriate primers (Table I) as we have described previously (34Ramamurthy V. Swann S.L. Paulson J.L. Spedaliere C.J. Mueller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22225-22230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding L244P IscS (with no C-terminal His6 tag) is pBH401; the plasmid encoding IscS·His6 (with Leu-244 restored) is pBH402; the plasmid encoding native IscS (with Leu-244 restored and no C-terminal His6 tag) is pBH403. The procedure for overexpression and purification of IscS·His6 and L244P IscS·His6 was identical to that for the overexpression and purification of ThiI (35Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2424-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) except that cultures of BLR(DE3) pLysS/pBH402 or BLR(DE3) pLysS/pBH400 were grown and induced in LB medium containing kanamycin (30 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). Isolated IscS·His6 (∼40 mg/liter of culture) was dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing magnesium chloride (5 mm), potassium chloride (100 mm), and EDTA (0.1 mm). The enzyme remains stable for weeks to months when stored at 4 °C in the same buffer at moderate concentration (3–4 mg/ml). By comparingA280 nm and the concentration of IscS measured by the biuret assay (35Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2424-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we calculated ε280 nm = 25,400m−1 cm−1, which we now use to determine the concentration of IscS·His6. BLR(DE3) pLysS/pBH402 (encoding IscS·His6) and BLR(DE3) pLysS/pBH403 (encoding native IscS) was transformed with pBH113 (encoding wild-type ThiI) using the TransformAidTM protocol (MBI Fermentas, Hanover, MD). The joint overexpression of ThiI and IscS was accomplished as described for the overexpression of either protein alone. ThiI overexpressed with native IscS was cleanly separated from the latter by chromatography over Ni-NTA resin. ThiI overexpressed with IscS·His6 was co-purified with the latter by chromatography over Ni-NTA resin; the two proteins were then separated by chromatography over Poros 20 HS resin, eluting with a linear gradient (over 13 column volumes) of potassium chloride (0–1.5m) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing DTT (1 mm). The UV-visible spectrum was recorded after exchange of isolated ThiI into 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing magnesium chloride (5 mm), potassium chloride (100 mm), and EDTA (0.1 mm) by size-exclusion chromatography over a spin column of Sephadex G-25 equilibrated in the same buffer. Samples of ThiI were subjected to DTNB titrations under both native and denaturing conditions. The enzyme samples were fresh preparations that had been isolated using buffers to which no reductant had been added. Any thiol-bearing components of the cell extracts (either small or macro-molecules) should have been removed by the chromatography over Ni-NTA and the exchange (by size-exclusion chromatography or dialysis) of ThiI-bearing column fractions into 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing magnesium chloride (5 mm), potassium chloride (100 mm), and EDTA (0.1 mm). The protein concentration ranged from 4.7 to 16.6 μm, and DTNB (20 eq relative to ThiI) was added as a solution (10 mm) in the same buffer. Control incubations were prepared by adding the same amount of DTNB to the same buffer (with no protein). The final mixtures (400 μl) were incubated 20–30 min at room temperature, and the intensely yellow dianion of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid was quantified by subtracting the A412 nm of the control incubation from the A412 nm of each sample and using an extinction coefficient of 13,600 m−1cm−1 (38Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. 3rd Ed. Oxford Science Publications, Oxford1986: 388Google Scholar). To denature the wild-type ThiI, solid guanidinium chloride (∼0.23 g, ∼2.4 mmol) was added to the samples and dissolved to achieve a final guanidinium concentration of ∼4.6m; the volume and A412 nm values were measured after 20 min at room temperature. All titrations were performed in duplicate except for the C456A ThiI under native conditions, which was performed in quadruplicate. Titrations of ThiI with 1 eq of DTNB were performed under native conditions as described for titration with 20 eq of DTNB. All replicate experiments returned values within 5% of each other. To test for disulfide bond formation in ThiI during turnover, the s4U generation assay was run without DTT, with a reduced concentration of cysteine (which can reduce disulfide bonds), and in phosphate buffer to allow separation of IscS and ThiI by cation-exchange chromatography. The assay (1 ml) consisted of 150 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, containing ATP (4 mm), PLP (40 μm), tRNA (18 μm), cysteine (70 μm), IscS (24 μm), and ThiI (6 μm). After 5 h at 37 °C, ThiI was separated from IscS and other reaction components by chromatography over Poros 20 HS resin as described above except that DTT was omitted from the buffers. The ThiI eluted in two fractions, which were combined (1 ml; 2–3 μm), concentrated in a Microcon-10 device, and subjected to DTNB titrations under denaturing conditions as described above. As a control for oxidation under these conditions, ThiI was also incubated in the absence of tRNA and cysteine and subjected to the same work up. To measure the extent of s4U formation under these conditions, a duplicate reaction containing [35S]cysteine was run in parallel; 0.73 ± 0.02 eq (relative to ThiI) of s4U was generated. Assuming that turnover results in the formation of one disulfide bond in ThiI, the expected number of free thiol groups in ThiI isolated after turnover is (0.73) (3 thiol groups) + (0.27) (5 thiol groups) = 3.5 thiol groups. The PCR-based cloning ofiscS from E. coli genomic DNA resulted in the generation of an IscS overexpression plasmid based on pET29b (pBH400). Sequencing revealed a deletion in the penultimate codon ofiscS during the PCR, resulting in a frameshift that fused a C-terminal His6 tag to IscS (denoted IscS·His6). In addition, a proline residue was encoded by codon 244 rather than the leucine specified by the sequence in the genomic data base. Overexpressed and purified L244P IscS·His6 proved fully competent for in vitroassay of ThiI activity. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate overexpression plasmids for Is"
https://openalex.org/W2104816446,"Formation of the solar system may have been triggered by a stellar wind. From then on, the solar system would have followed a conventional evolutionary path, including the formation of a disk and bipolar jets. The now extinct short-lived radionuclides beryllium-10 and, possibly, manganese-53 that were present in meteorites probably resulted from energetic particle irradiation within the solar system. Calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (the oldest known solar system solids) and chondrules could have been produced by the bipolar jets, but it is more likely that they formed during localized events in the asteroid belt. The chondritic meteorites formed within the temperature range (100 to 400 kelvin) inferred for the midplane of classical T Tauri disks at 2 to 3 astronomical units from their central stars. However, these meteorites may retain a chemical memory of earlier times when midplane temperatures were much higher. Dissipation of the solar nebula occurred within a few million years of solar system formation, whereas differentiation of asteroidal-sized bodies occurred within 5 to 15 million years. The terrestrial planets took approximately 100 million years to form. Consequently, they would have accreted already differentiated bodies, and their final assembly was not completed until after the solar nebula had dispersed. This implies that water-bearing asteroids and/or icy planetesimals that formed near Jupiter are the likely sources of Earth's water."

Therefore, the interaction of glycosaminoglycans with cationic lipid-DNA complexes (CLDCs) has been characterized using a combination of biophysical approaches.

The mechanism by which such complexes enter cells is, however, unclear. These agents are able to efficiently deliver DNA to a variety of very different cell types (1Ledley F.D. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1129-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This suggests a general entry mechanism rather than one requiring highly specific membrane receptors. Recent evidence suggests cell surface proteoglycans have a significant impact on polycation-mediated gene delivery. Proteoglycans are a diverse class of molecules consisting of a protein core and one or more anionic glycosaminoglycan chains, which include heparan, dermatan and chondroitin sulfates (2Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They can exist as both integral and GPI1-linked membrane proteins at the cell surface. Proteoglycans are fundamental components of basement membranes and the extracellular matrix, playing important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation (3Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Their physical and chemical composition is highly dependent upon cell type, stage of differentiation, and cell cycle phase (2Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More provocatively from the perspective of this work, they also appear to act as receptors or co-receptors for several viruses such as herpes simplex virus-2 (4Herold B.C. WuDunn D. Soltys N. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), adenoassociated virus-2 (5Summerford C. Samulski R.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), human immunodeficiency virus-1 (6Patel M. Yanagishita M. Roderiquez G. Bou-Habib D.C. Oravecz T. Hascall V.C. Norcross M.A. AIDS Res. Hum.

Virology. 2000; 268: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), all of which have been employed as efficient gene delivery vehicles.Several roles for proteoglycans in nonviral gene delivery have been suggested. Recent studies have found that the alteration of proteoglycans on the cell surface by inhibition of polysaccharide sulfation with chlorate, their enzymatic removal, or the use of genetically altered cells that possess reduced cell surface GAGs, greatly reduced transfection efficiency (either in terms of number of cells transfected or amount of protein expressed) for both cationic polymer (8Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) and lipid-based delivery complexes (8Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26164-26170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of HSPGs and GAGs in the extracellular media has been shown to decrease the transfection efficiency of cationic polymer and lipid-DNA complexes in vitro (10Ruponen M. Yla-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 11Belting M. Petersson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19375-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition to the proposed role for cell surface HSPGs as nonspecific “receptors” for polycation/DNA complexes, Belting and Petersson (12Belting M. Petersson P. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that proteoglycans may also play a protective role in nonviral gene delivery by sequestering cationic lipids and possibly other polycations, thereby reducing their cytotoxicity. These results provide indirect but compelling evidence that HSPGs play a significant role in nonviral gene delivery, the precise role of which is yet to be determined.Several studies have examined the effect of polyanions on the physical properties of polycation-DNA complexes. Szoka and colleagues (13Xu Y. Szoka Jr., F.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5616-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 14Zelphati O. Szoka Jr., F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1998; 1390: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that several polyanions, including anionic liposomes and the GAG, heparin, can release DNA from its association with cationic lipid, as demonstrated by the reversal of fluorescent dye exclusion from DNA. Subsequently, several authors have described similar results for a variety of polyanions as well as several polycations using related fluorescence-based assays (10Ruponen M. Yla-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 16Trubetskoy V.S. Loomis A. Slattum P.M. Hagstrom J.E. Budker V.G. Wolff J.A. Bioconjugate Chem. 1999; 10: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Wonget al. and Koltover et al. have described the binding of CLDCs to anionic surfaces of latex beads (17Wong F.M. Bally M.B. Brooks D.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 366: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and giant unilamellar vesicles (18Koltover I. Salditt T. Radler J.O. Safinya C.R. Science. 1998; 281: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar), respectively. With such considerations in mind, we have conducted an analysis of the interaction of two GAGs, heparin and heparan sulfate with CLDCs, in an effort to characterize the physical nature of the interaction as well as the influence of CLDC composition on any observed complexation. Studies were conducted at two different ionic strengths to further define the interaction.DISCUSSIONThe mechanism by which nonviral gene delivery vehicles enter cells remains controversial. Several previous studies have addressed a potential role for HSPGs and GAGs in nonviral gene delivery (8Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 9Mounkes L.C. Zhong W. Cipres-Palacin G. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19375-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Belting M. Petersson P. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although these studies show an increase in transfection efficiency when HSPGs are present on the cell surface and a corresponding decrease when HSPGs are added to the cell culture medium, whether this involves a direct interaction between cell-surface HSPGs and nonviral gene delivery vehicles is unknown. This study presents the first attempt to quantitatively describe the interaction of CLDCs with GAGs bound to a surface and free in solution. Although this is very much a model study, the use of such a well defined system permits the quantitation of physical interaction to be directly addressed. The inherent heterogeneity of these CLDCs, however, makes a more detailed interpretation of results difficult. Instead, a global average description of the interaction is reported. By examining this interaction under a variety of solution conditions and using several analytical approaches, however, we are able to directly demonstrate the interaction of cationic lipid-DNA complexes with model proteoglycans and three major aspects of this interaction: 1) the ionic strength dependence of the interaction, 2) the effect of helper lipids on the interaction, and 3) the effect of glycosaminoglycan structure on the interaction.Effect of Ionic Strength on the Interaction of GAGs with CLDCsVariations in ionic strength are expected to have significant effects on interactions that are primarily electrostatic in nature. Unfortunately, the actual ionic strength at any cell surface is poorly defined. Since we are dealing with highly charged surfaces, the “apparent” ionic strength of the surface is much higher than the bulk media. For instance, if we assume the surface has a ζ-potential of −25 mV, then the ionic strength at the surface would by 0.17 for a bulk ionic strength of 0.11 (e.g. these experiments) from a simple Boltzmann calculation. Thus, using lower ionic strength media (e.g. I = 0.11) to characterize the interaction of charged surfaces (e.g. cell surfaces and the surface of a cationic lipid-DNA complex) might, in fact, be fairly representative of physiologic ionic strength. Due to the uncertainty in defining the actual ionic strength at the cell surface, we studied the interaction between CLDCs and model proteoglycan systems at two ionic strengths. Although these studies could not be performed at physiological ionic strength (i.e. 150 mm NaCl) due to the instability of the CLDCs at the high concentrations necessary for biophysical analysis, clear trends are apparent upon increasing the ionic strength from 0.01 to 0.11.In studying the binding of CLDCs to a model heparin-derivatized surface, increasing the ionic strength 11-fold from 0.01 to 0.11 results in a 4-fold decrease in the amount of DOTAP CLDC bound (compare Figs. 1 and 2). Both lipid and DNA components of CLDC at a 1:1 charge ratio, which possesses a negative ζ-potential, bind equally to the heparin surface at both ionic strengths, suggesting the complex remains intact. At either ionic strength, complete neutralization of heparin negative charge is not observed, probably due to steric constraint of the immobilized species along with steric packing limitations of CLDCs at the surface. If the amount of lipid bound to the beads is converted from moles of lipid to moles of a single CLDC (see Ref. 27Lasic D.D. Liposomes in Gene Delivery. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1997: 295Google Scholar), however, roughly 6 × 106 CLDCs bind a single heparin bead at low ionic strength whereas 1.5 × 106 CLDCs bind to a single bead at higher ionic strength, suggesting a significant capacity for complexes on the heparin surface. This result is comparable to the number of copies of CLDC plasmid described previously with HeLa cells (28Tseng W.C. Haselton F.R. Giorgio T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25641-25647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Additional calculations based on the scaled particle theory of Cotter (29Cotter M.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1977; 66: 1098-1106Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar) lend support for an enhanced association of CLDCs with cell surface HSPGs, based on the fact that such CLDCs would have activity coefficients between 10 and 100 as a consequence of excluded volume effects of the highly concentrated proteoglycans at the cell surface (data not shown).At low ionic strength (10 mm Tris buffer), binding isotherms of 2:1 DOTAP CLDCs suggest the presence of multiple species of complexes, as indicated by the differences in the relative amount of lipid and DNA bound when added above or below 75 µm DNA phosphate. Xu et al. (30Xu Y. Hui S.W. Frederik P. Szoka Jr., F.C. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 341-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) have demonstrated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation that a 2:1 DOTAP CLDC is composed of at least two different species. Complexes at 11% (w/v) sucrose presumably represent lipid-rich and those at 18% DNA-rich species. Our results suggest that, when 2:1 DOTAP CLDCs are added to the beads at relatively low concentrations, the DNA-rich species dominates the interaction. At higher CLDC concentrations, the less abundant lipid-containing species, possessing a greater affinity for the beads, occupies the majority of the heparin binding sites. As CLDCs represent a heterogeneous population of particles, further studies are necessary to more accurately define the apparent dichotomy observed in complex binding to a heparin surface.Although binding of CLDCs to HSPGs at the cell surface may be the major interaction necessary for transfection, association of CLDCs with heparin free in solution may also be important in terms of release of the DNA from the CLDC either in the extracellular space or upon cell internalization. Results regarding the interaction of soluble heparin with CLDCs suggest a significant shift in the relative “affinity” of DNA for DOTAP as compared with that of heparin upon increasing ionic strength. Light scattering measurements demonstrate a heparin-induced aggregation of the DOTAP CLDCs at low ionic strength based on the observed increase in the apparent size of the complexes (Fig. 3). For positively charged CLDCs, precipitation occurs when heparin is added to the point of complete charge neutrality (Fig. 3, A andD), whereas all CLDCs showed a lesser degree of aggregation in the presence of excess heparin at low ionic strength (Fig. 3,B and E). Similar trends are not observed at higher ionic strength. The return of the apparent size to a value smaller than that observed for CLDC alone in the presence of excess heparin suggests complex disassembly (Fig. 3 C). Circular dichroism, which can be used to measure the packaging of DNA in CLDCs, suggests that heparin can release DNA from CLDCs, with much greater amounts of heparin required to cause release at low compared with higher ionic strength (Fig. 6).Further insight into the nature of the interaction between CLDCs and heparin in solution is obtained by ITC. Given the spontaneity of this interaction, its entropic nature is apparent from the unfavorable endothermic heats observed when heparin is titrated into DOTAP CLDCs at low ionic strength (Fig. 4 A). This favorable entropic signature is consistent with an electrostatic character to the interaction (31Kennedy M.T. Pozharski E.V. Rakhmanova V.A. MacDonald R.C. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1620-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 32Lobo B.A. Rogers S.A. Wiethoff C.M. Choosakoonkriang S. Middaugh C.R. Methods Mol. Med. 2000; 65: 319-348Google Scholar). Additional entropic contributions from apolar interactions (e.g. membrane fusion) may be present but are not readily separable. The ∼10-fold lower ΔH app of binding seen for the interaction of heparin with DOTAP compared with the interaction of DNA with the same lipid (32Lobo B.A. Rogers S.A. Wiethoff C.M. Choosakoonkriang S. Middaugh C.R. Methods Mol. Med. 2000; 65: 319-348Google Scholar) suggests distinct roles for the charge density, molecular weight, and chemical nature of the polyanion involved in the interaction. At increased ionic strength, the ΔH app of binding of heparin to liposomes alone is decreased and ΔH app of binding of heparin to 1:1 DOTAP CLDCs switches from endothermic to exothermic. Although the heat of binding for heparin to DOTAP is +0.4 kJ/mol DOTAP, that of DNA binding to DOTAP is ∼+3 kJ/mol DOTAP (33Lobo B.A. Smith A. Koe G.S. Smith J.G. Middaugh C.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Assuming that 1 mol of polyanion negative charge interacts/1 mol of DOTAP positive charge, additivity of the enthalpies of binding of heparin and release of DNA (+0.4 − (+3) kJ/mol of DOTAP) would result in an exothermic heat of −2.6 kJ/mol DOTAP, which is within experimental error of the heat observed in the calorimetric titration (−2.4 kJ/mol DOTAP, Fig.4 C). Thus, at physiologically relevant ionic strength, a significant concentration of free GAGs would be expected to facilitate release of DNA from CLDCs.Effect of Helper Lipids on the Interaction of CLDCs with a Model GAGThus far, the role of helper lipids has mainly been defined in terms of the fusogenic properties of the helper lipids (34Farhood H. Serbina N. Huang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1235: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Although it appears that this helper lipid-associated property is important for endosomal release of DNA, protection of the DNA and association of DNA in CLDCs with the cell surface could also be important properties as well. Incorporation of helper lipids into CLDCs results in enhanced heparin-bead binding at both ionic strengths studied (Figs. 1 and 2). Consistent with this observation, incorporation of DOPE up to a 3:2 ratio with cationic lipid has been shown to enhance cellular association of DNA over that of cationic lipid alone (35Fasbender A.

This enhancement presumably reflects the structural differences between CLDCs with and without helper lipids (e.g. size, relative amount of DNA per particle, etc.).In solution, helper lipid containing CLDCs show trends similar to DOTAP CLDCs in heparin-dependent aggregation at both ionic strengths studied (Fig. 3). Circular dichroism studies reveal that by incorporating DOPE or cholesterol into CLDCs, a greater amount of heparin is required to release 50% of the DNA from these complexes (roughly 1.5 times more heparin for both ionic strengths studied). Thus, incorporation of helper lipids into CLDCs may have significant roles in transfection beyond that of facilitating endosomal release of DNA.Influence of GAG Structure on the Interaction with CLDCsSince heparan sulfate is more representative of cell surface GAGs than heparin, we also examined its interaction with CLDCs. Although both polysaccharides possess similar carbohydrate backbone structures and broad size distributions in the range of 4–20 kDa, they differ considerably in their distribution of sulfate groups along the polymer. Heparin is more highly sulfated (2.4 sulfate groups/disaccharide unit) with a considerably greater fraction ofN-sulfated glucosamine monomers, whereas heparan sulfate possesses fewer sulfates per disaccharide (1.2) and a greater fraction of N-acetylglucosamine monomers (36Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 7-50Crossref Google Scholar). It is apparent that these two polymers interact quantitatively differently with CLDCs. In the case of 1:1 DOTAP CLDCs, DLS and CD measurements suggest that heparan sulfate facilitates DNA release as well as heparin. Calorimetry experiments demonstrate that heparan sulfate binding to 1:1 DOTAP CLDCs is also exothermic as a result of DNA release from the CLDC. Titration of 1:1 DOTAP CLDCs with heparan sulfate, however, does not yield results that closely resemble the simple additivity of interactions of heparan sulfate and DNA with DOTAP, suggesting that there may be additional processes involved in the interaction of heparan sulfate with CLDCs. In contrast to heparin, incorporation of helper lipids into the CLDC greatly reduces DNA release from the complex by heparan sulfate.These studies have provided quantitative insight into the interaction of model proteoglycans with CLDCs. Information is reported regarding the effect of ionic strength on the interaction as well as discovery of additional potential roles for helper lipids in CLDC-cell interactions. Additionally, results from these studies suggest that differences in GAG expression can significantly affect the interaction as indicated by the comparison between heparin and heparan sulfate above. Although it is now clear that the anionic nature of HSPGs can facilitate significant CLDC association with cells, studies of CLDC interaction with GAGs upon internalization may elucidate further roles for proteoglycans in CLDC-mediated gene delivery. Complexes of DNA and various polymers such as cationic lipids, polypeptides, amino-dendrimers, and polyethyleneimine are able to transfect cells and are currently being evaluated as gene delivery vehicles for various clinical indications. The mechanism by which such complexes enter cells is, however, unclear. These agents are able to efficiently deliver DNA to a variety of very different cell types (1Ledley F.D. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1129-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This suggests a general entry mechanism rather than one requiring highly specific membrane receptors. Recent evidence suggests cell surface proteoglycans have a significant impact on polycation-mediated gene delivery. Proteoglycans are a diverse class of molecules consisting of a protein core and one or more anionic glycosaminoglycan chains, which include heparan, dermatan and chondroitin sulfates (2Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They can exist as both integral and GPI1-linked membrane proteins at the cell surface. Proteoglycans are fundamental components of basement membranes and the extracellular matrix, playing important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation (3Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Their physical and chemical composition is highly dependent upon cell type, stage of differentiation, and cell cycle phase (2Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More provocatively from the perspective of this work, they also appear to act as receptors or co-receptors for several viruses such as herpes simplex virus-2 (4Herold B.C. WuDunn D. Soltys N. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), adenoassociated virus-2 (5Summerford C. Samulski R.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), human immunodeficiency virus-1 (6Patel M. Yanagishita M. Roderiquez G. Bou-Habib D.C. Oravecz T. Hascall V.C. Norcross M.A. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1993; 9: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and adenovirus (7Dechecchi M.C. Tamanini A. Bonizzato A. Cabrini G. Virology. 2000; 268: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), all of which have been employed as efficient gene delivery vehicles. Several roles for proteoglycans in nonviral gene delivery have been suggested. Recent studies have found that the alteration of proteoglycans on the cell surface by inhibition of polysaccharide sulfation with chlorate, their enzymatic removal, or the use of genetically altered cells that possess reduced cell surface GAGs, greatly reduced transfection efficiency (either in terms of number of cells transfected or amount of protein expressed) for both cationic polymer (8Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) and lipid-based delivery complexes (8Mislick K.A. Baldeschwieler J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 9Mounkes L.C. Zhong W. Cipres-Palacin G. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26164-26170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of HSPGs and GAGs in the extracellular media has been shown to decrease the transfection efficiency of cationic polymer and lipid-DNA complexes in vitro (10Ruponen M. Yla-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 11Belting M. Petersson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19375-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition to the proposed role for cell surface HSPGs as nonspecific “receptors” for polycation/DNA complexes, Belting and Petersson (12Belting M. Petersson P. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that proteoglycans may also play a protective role in nonviral gene delivery by sequestering cationic lipids and possibly other polycations, thereby reducing their cytotoxicity. These results provide indirect but compelling evidence that HSPGs play a significant role in nonviral gene delivery, the precise role of which is yet to be determined. Several studies have examined the effect of polyanions on the physical properties of polycation-DNA complexes. Szoka and colleagues (13Xu Y. Szoka Jr., F.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5616-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 14Zelphati O. Szoka Jr., F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1998; 1390: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that several polyanions, including anionic liposomes and the GAG, heparin, can release DNA from its association with cationic lipid, as demonstrated by the reversal of fluorescent dye exclusion from DNA. Subsequently, several authors have described similar results for a variety of polyanions as well as several polycations using related fluorescence-based assays (10Ruponen M. Yla-Herttuala S. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 16Trubetskoy V.S. Loomis A. Slattum P.M. Hagstrom J.E. Budker V.G. Wolff J.A. Bioconjugate Chem. 1999; 10: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Wonget al. and Koltover et al. have described the binding of CLDCs to anionic surfaces of latex beads (17Wong F.M. Bally M.B. Brooks D.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 366: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and giant unilamellar vesicles (18Koltover I. Salditt T. Radler J.O. Safinya C.R. Science. 1998; 281: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar), respectively. With such considerations in mind, we have conducted an analysis of the interaction of two GAGs, heparin and heparan sulfate with CLDCs, in an effort to characterize the physical nature of the interaction as well as the influence of CLDC composition on any observed complexation. Studies were conducted at two different ionic strengths to further define the interaction. DISCUSSIONThe mechanism by which nonviral gene delivery vehicles enter cells remains controversial. Several previous studies have addressed a potential role for HSPGs and GAGs in nonviral gene delivery (8Mislick K.A. Baldeschwie"
https://openalex.org/W2081515783,"Previous results have shown that in rat portal vein myocytes the βγ dimer of the G13 protein transduces the angiotensin II-induced stimulation of calcium channels and increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration through activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). In the present work we determined which class I PI3K isoforms were involved in this regulation. Western blot analysis indicated that rat portal vein myocytes expressed only PI3Kα and PI3Kγ and no other class I PI3K isoforms. In the intracellular presence of an anti-p110γ antibody infused by the patch clamp pipette, both angiotensin II- and Gβγ-mediated stimulation of Ca2+ channel current were inhibited, whereas intracellular application of an anti-p110α antibody had no effect. The anti-PI3Kγ antibody also inhibited the angiotensin II- and Gβγ-induced production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. In Indo-1 loaded cells, the angiotensin II-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was inhibited by intracellular application of the anti-PI3Kγ antibody, whereas the anti-PI3Kα antibody had no effect. The specificity of the anti-PI3Kγ antibody used in functional experiments was ascertained by showing that this antibody did not recognize recombinant PI3Kα in Western blot experiments. Moreover, anti-PI3Kγ antibody inhibited the stimulatory effect of intracellularly infused recombinant PI3Kγ on Ca2+ channel current without altering the effect of recombinant PI3Kα. Our results show that, although both PI3Kγ and PI3Kα are expressed in vascular myocytes, the angiotensin II-induced stimulation of vascular L-type calcium channel and increase of [Ca2+]i involves only the PI3Kγ isoform.

Iwao H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 11-34PubMed Google Scholar). AII have been reported to activate different pathways in vascular smooth muscles. In A7r5 smooth muscle cells, AII stimulates calcium channels via a tyrosine kinase and a undetermined phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (2Seki T. Yokoshiki H. Sunagawa M. Nakamura M. Sperelakis N. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 437: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In porcine coronary artery smooth muscle cells, AII activates the p85 subunit of PI3K via a tyrosine phosphorylation (3Saward L. Zahradka P. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 249-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In rat portal vein myocytes, AII stimulates voltage-gated L-type calcium channel activity and thus calcium influx (4Macrez-Lepretre N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 468-475PubMed Google Scholar, 5Morel J.L. Macrez-Lepretre N. Mironneau J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The signaling pathway leading to this cellular response involves the Gα13β1γ3 protein-coupled AT1A receptor but does not involve tyrosine kinase. The β1γ3 dimer of the G13 protein transduces the AII-induced stimulation of calcium channels through activation of PI3K and protein kinase C (PKC) (6Macrez N. Morel J.L. Kalkbrenner F. Viard P.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). PI3Ks are key enzymes involved in the regulation of multiple biological responses including regulation of ionic channel activity (7Viard P. Exner T. Maier U. Mironneau J. Nurnberg B. Macrez N. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Xie L.H. Takano M. Kakei M. Okamura M. Noma A. J. Physiol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4660-4669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The primary enzymatic activity of PI3Ks is the phosphorylation of phosphoinositides at the 3′ position of the inositol ring leading to the formation of second messengers. PI3Ks are grouped into three classes (I, II, III) depending on their substrate specificity. Class I phosphorylates PI, PI 4-P, PI 4,5-P2, whereas class II prefers PI and PI 4-P as substrates. Class III members phosphorylate only PI. Class I enzymes are heterodimers composed of a catalytic subunit p110α, p110β, p110δ, or p110γ and a regulatory or adaptor subunit. The first three catalytic subunits are closely associated with a regulatory subunit (p85, p55, or p50), whereas p110γ is associated with a p101 adaptor subunit (11Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). PI3K activities are regulated in vivo by different mechanisms. The class I p110α, -β, and -δ have been reported to be regulated by receptors with intrinsic or associated tyrosine kinase activity or by small G proteins (12Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 13Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In contrast, PI3Kγ is activated by Gβγ released upon G protein-coupled receptor activation (14Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 15Maier U. Babich A. Nurnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29311-29317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). By using recombinant Gβγ dimers, the β1γ2 dimer of G proteins has been shown to be a more potent activator of PI3Kγ than the β5γ2 dimer (16Maier U. Babich A. Macrez N. Leopoldt D. Gierschik P. Illenberger D. Nurnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13746-13754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, G protein-coupled receptors may stimulate a p85-dependent PI3K as described in human vascular smooth muscle cells (17Hu Z.W. Shi X.Y. Lin R.Z. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8977-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and PI3Kβ has also been shown to be activated by Gβγ (15Maier U. Babich A. Nurnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29311-29317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 18Kurosu H. Maehama T. Okada T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino S. Fukui Y. Ui M. Hazeki O. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24252-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, the identification of Gβγ-dependent PI3Ks extends the range of intracellular processes that could be mediated by PI3K, although specific physiological processes mediated by PI3Kβ or PI3Kγ are not well described. Few reports indicate that specific isoform of PI3K can be involved in precise signaling pathway. PI3Kβ plays an important role in transmitting the mitogenic response induced by some but not all growth factors (19Roche S. Downward J. Raynal P. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7119-7129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas PI3Kγ regulates the activation of cationic current by acetylcholine in Xenopusovocytes (20Wang Y.X. Dhulipala P.D. Li L. Benovic J.L. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13859-13864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Expression and distribution of the different PI3K isoforms in vascular smooth muscle cells are not well described, and the isoform of PI3K involved in AII-mediated response has not been identified. The purpose of this study was to investigate which types of class I PI3K isoforms could be activated by AII to stimulate voltage-gated calcium channel activity. By using different antibodies, we identified the PI3K isoforms expressed in rat portal vein myocytes. The same antibodies were used in patch clamp experiments to identify the isoforms involved in the transduction pathway coupling AII receptors to stimulation of Ca2+ channels. We have shown that rat portal vein myocytes express both PI3Kα and -γ, but only PI3Kγ is involved in the regulation of L-type calcium channels by AII. Isolated myocytes from rat portal vein were obtained by enzymatic dispersion as described previously (21Leprêtre N. Mironneau J. Morel J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29546-29552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of about 103cells/mm2 on glass slides in physiological solution and used over the next 24 h. Voltage clamp and membrane current recordings were made with a standard patch clamp technique using a List EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier (Darmstadt-Eberstadt, Germany). Whole-cell recordings were performed with patch pipettes having resistances of 2–5 megaohms. Membrane potential and current records were stored and analyzed using a PC computer (P-clamp system, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Cell capacitance was determined in each cell tested by imposing 10-mV hyperpolarizing and depolarizing steps from the holding potential (−40 mV) and analyzing the amplitude and the time course of the recorded currents. Current density was expressed as the maximum amplitude of the current/capacitance unit (pA/pF). The kinetic of inactivation of the current was calculated with a mono-exponential function (f(t) = A exp(−t/τ) + C) according to the P-clamp system. Steady-state inactivation experiments were performed by a double pulse protocol. The holding potential was −80 mV; a test pulse to +10 mV was preceded by a prepulse of 10 s duration and of variable amplitude (from −80 mV up to 10 mV). Steady-state inactivation curves were fitted with a Boltzman equation. In some experiments, PI3K antibody and Gβγ were added to the patch clamp pipette solution. As the rate of diffusion of PI3K antibody and Gβγ complex from the pipette to cell may be different (because of the different molecular mass of the two proteins) and the kinetics of activation of PI3K by Gβγ may also differ from the kinetics of inhibition of PI3K by the antibody, a sandwich technique was used to fill the patch clamp pipette. The tip of the patch clamp pipette, back-filled with a solution containing the antibody plus Gβγ protein, was dipped in a control pipette solution containing only the antibody to allow an early diffusion of the antibody. Measurements of [Ca2+]i were performed with an indo-1 setup described elsewhere (5Morel J.L. Macrez-Lepretre N. Mironneau J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were preloaded with the membrane-permeable indo-1 AM (1 µm) for 30 min, and 50 µm indo-1 was added to the pipette solution and entered the cells after establishment of the whole-cell recording mode. [Ca2+]i was estimated from the 405/480 nm fluorescence ratio using a calibration determined within cells. The normal physiological solution contained (in mm): 130 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 11 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH. The basic pipette solution contained (in mm): 130 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 5 ATP-Na2, 2 MgCl2 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, with CsOH. For the recording of Ca2+ channel currents with the patch clamp technique, 5 mm BaCl2 was substituted for CaCl2 in the physiological solution, and bovine serum albumin (0.1%) was added in the pipette solution to increase protein infusion. AII or PDBu was applied on the cells via pressure ejection from a glass pipette. All experiments were performed at 28 ± 1 °C. Microsomal proteins or recombinant PI3K were treated with Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 10 min, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% separating gel with 4% stacking gel). The resolved proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, Bio-Rad) membrane (1 h at 100 V). PVDF membrane was then blocked for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline complemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and incubated overnight with the primary antibody at 2 µg/ml (anti-PI3Kα, anti-PI3Kβ, anti-PI3Kδ, or anti-PI3Kγ antibody). After extensive washes in PBS-T, membranes were incubated for 2 h with a 0.4 µg/ml dilution of peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG in PBS-T complemented with 3% bovine serum albumin. Specific antigen detection was performed using the Bio-Rad Opti 4CN substrate kit. Gels were analyzed with KDS1D 2.0 software (Kodak Digital Science, Paris). Portal veins were removed, cut into several pieces, homogenized in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4, 4 °C), 1 mm EGTA, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmiodoacetamide and centrifuged at 170 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was submitted to ultra-centrifugation at 106,000 × g for 90 min (4 °C). The pellet composed of microsomes was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4, 4 °C), 1 mm EGTA, 6 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CMP. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositides were labeled with 14 µCi of [3H]myo-inositol ([3H]Ins) per mg of membranes and per ml of buffer according to Claro et al. (23Claro E. Fain J.N. Picatoste F. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2078-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Microsomal fractions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of 1 mm Na+ cholate, 15 mm LiCl, 50 µm ATP, 100 nm GTP, and 100 µmpropranolol to prevent phospholipase D-derived diacylglycerol formation (24Fujita K. Murakami M. Yamashita F. Amemiya K. Kudo I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and 0.1 µm AII. Reactions were terminated by adding CHCl3/MeOH/HCl (2/1/0.02 (v/v/v)). Extractions of [3H]PIs and [3H]InsPs from the samples were performed by adding 2 m KCl/CHCl3 (1/1 (v/v)) leading to the formation of two phases. The lower chloroformic phase containing inositol lipids was submitted to thin layer chromatography after pretreatment of silica gel plates with 1% potassium oxalate, 50% ethanol, and 1 mm EDTA. Phosphoinositides were separated using CHCl3/MeOH/NH4+/H2O (70/100/15/25 (v/v/v/v)). PI 3,4,5-P3, PI 4,5-P2, PI 4-P, and PI were eluted with the followingR f values: 0.10, 0.37, 0.50 and 0.63, respectively. The PI3K activity was expressed as the proportion of [3H]PI 3,4,5-P3 among the totality of [3H]PIs. The polyclonal antibodies raised against PI3K isoforms (SC1331, SC7175, SC7176, and SC1404), anti-PI3Kγ antibody blocking peptide (SC1404p), peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit (SC2004), and anti-goat IgG (SC2020) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Myo-[2-3H(N)]-inositol was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. AII was from Neosystem Laboratories (Strasbourg, France). Phorbol ester 12,13-dibutyrate and 4α-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate were from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Indo-1, indo-1 AM, and LY294002 were purchased from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant PI3Ks (p85/p110α-GST, p85/p110β-His, p85/p110δ-GST, and p101-GST/p110γ) as well as purified Gβγ were produced by Aleksei Babich and Bernd Nürnberg as described previously (15Maier U.

Student's t test was performed to estimate the significance of the differences between mean values. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. In rat portal vein myocytes, only two PI3K isoforms (PI3Kα and PI3Kγ) were detected by Western blot experiments on crude extract of myocyte membranes (Fig. 1). The antibody raised against p110γ (PI3Kγ Ab) recognized a single band of 120 kDa, and the antibody raised against p110α (PI3Kα Ab) detected a single band of 110 kDa (Fig. 1 A). The two other class I PI3K isoforms (i.e. p110β and p110δ) were not detected in rat portal vein myocytes (Fig. 1 A). It is noteworthy that the anti-p110β and anti-p110δ antibodies recognized the recombinant PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Identification of PI3K isoforms by immunochemistry on 1 day-cultured myocytes led to the same results (data not shown). All experiments and measurements of the current were performed at least 5 min after the break-through into the whole-cell patch clamp configuration to allow intracellular diffusion of the pipette solution and stabilization of the Ba2+ current. Ba2+ current densities were calculated for a step depolarization of +10 mV from a holding potential of −40 mV. The mean capacitance of the cells was 16.30 ± 0.52 pF (n = 160). Intracellular application of PI3Kγ Ab (alone or in the presence of its antigenic peptide) or PI3Kα Ab did not change the density of the basal Ba2+ current (Fig. 2,A and B). Both PI3Kγ Ab and PI3Kα Ab alter neither the kinetics of inactivation (98 ± 9 ms,n = 8 and 94 ± 12 ms, n = 6, respectively), when compared with control conditions (105 ± 11 ms, n = 18, Fig. 2 A), nor the current-voltage relationship of the Ba2+ current (data not shown). Furthermore, the steady-state inactivation of the Ba2+ current was not different in the presence or absence of PI3Kγ Ab (half-inactivation potential: −30.2 ± 0.7 mV,n = 5 instead of −29.9 ± 0.7 mV,n = 6, in control condition; data not shown). The efficacy of the different antibodies was tested on the stimulatory effects of recombinant PI3Ks on L-type Ca2+ channels. PI3Kα or γ antibodies were preincubated for 45 min before patch clamp recording with intracellular solution containing the recombinant PI3Ks. As shown in Fig. 3A, the Ba2+ current density was increased from 7.2 ± 1.2 pA/pF (n = 7) in control conditions to 12.6 ± 1.1 pA/pF (n = 8) in the intracellular presence of 1 nm PI3Kγ (p110γ catalytic subunit associated with p101 subunit). When PI3Kγ was preincubated with the PI3Kγ Ab, the current density was similar to that obtained in control cells (8.5 ± 1.1 pA/pF, n = 11; Fig. 3 A). The inhibitory effect of the antibody was specific of the immune reaction since inactivation of the PI3Kγ Ab, obtained by preincubation in the presence of the antigenic peptide or by boiling the antibody, did not statistically change the Ba2+ current density (12.0 ± 1.1 pA/pF, n = 7) compared with the Ba2+current density obtained in the presence of the enzyme alone (12.6 ± 1.1 pA/pF, n = 8, Fig. 3 A). Intracellular perfusion of PI3Kα also induced an increase in the current density (11.3 ± 1.3 pA/pF, n = 6versus 6.5 ± 1.2 pA/pF, n = 10 in control conditions, Fig. 3 B) similar to that induced by PI3Kγ. The current density returned to control value when the recombinant PI3Kα was preincubated with the PI3Kα Ab (7.0 ± 0.8 pA/pF, n = 5, Fig. 3 B). By contrast, the PI3Kα-induced increase in current density was not altered when this enzyme was preincubated with the PI3Kγ Ab (10.9 ± 0.5 pA/pF,n = 5, Fig. 3 B). The specificity of the PI3Kγ Ab used in functional experiments was also tested by checking its ability to cross-react with recombinant PI3Kα in Western blot experiments. Recombinant PI3Kα was recognized by the PI3Kα Ab but not by the PI3Kγ Ab, whereas recombinant PI3Kγ was recognized by the PI3Kγ Ab but not by the PI3Kα Ab (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that the antibodies can specifically recognize the different isoforms of PI3Ks and inhibit their effects on calcium channels. The effects of AII on Ba2+ currents were expressed as a percentage of stimulation rather than in variation of current density because cells were their own control, and therefore the capacitance of the cells did not influence the results. AII was applied for 5 min after the rupture of the patch, and the peak stimulatory effect was obtained 1–2 min after the beginning of AII perfusion. In control conditions, AII (0.1 µm) stimulated the peak Ba2+ current by 30.4 ± 3.5% (n = 17, Fig. 4, A and B), as reported previously (4Macrez-Lepretre N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 468-475PubMed Google Scholar). In the intracellular presence of PI3Kγ Ab, the stimulation of the Ba2+ current by AII was suppressed (2.6 ± 2%, n = 9, Fig. 4,A and B). This inhibition was linked to the immune function of the antibody as the infusion of the boiled antibody or the antibody preincubated with the antigenic peptide did not prevent the stimulation of the Ba2+ current by AII (respectively, 29.7 ± 1.9%, n = 4, data not shown and 28.4 ± 1.1%, n = 3, Fig. 4 B). In contrast, in the intracellular presence of PI3Kα Ab, the AII-induced increase in current amplitude (27.3 ± 3.8%, n = 6) was similar to that obtained in control conditions (Fig. 4, Aand B). Previous results have shown that AII mobilizes Gβγ to transduce the signal leading to the stimulation of the Ba2+ currents through PI3K and PKC (6Macrez N. Morel J.L. Kalkbrenner F. Viard P. Schultz G. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23180-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7Viard P. Exner T. Maier U. Mironneau J. Nurnberg B. Macrez N. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Intracellular infusion of purified Gβγ protein (0.1 µm) from bovine brain mimicked the effect of AII and stimulated the Ba2+ current density from 7.1 ± 0.9 pA/pF (n = 15) in control conditions to 11.8 ± 2.7 pA/pF (n = 10; Fig.5A). This effect was maximal within 5 min. In the presence of PI3Kγ Ab, the Gβγ protein was ineffective, as the current density was not statistically different from the current density obtained in control conditions (Fig.5 A). In contrast, intracellular application of the PI3Kα Ab had no effect on the Gβγ-induced stimulation of the Ba2+ current density (Fig. 5 A). PKC has been suggested to be a downstream effector of PI3K in the AII-induced stimulation of Ca2+ channel pathway (7Viard P. Exner T. Maier U. Mironneau J. Nurnberg B. Macrez N. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because phorbol esters also stimulate the Ca2+ channels by directly activating PKC (21Leprêtre N. Mironneau J. Morel J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29546-29552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we evaluated the effect of PI3Kγ Ab on the PDBu-induced increase in Ba2+ current. In the intracellular presence of either PI3Kγ Ab or PI3Kα Ab, PDBu (0.1 µm) induced a stimulation of the Ba2+ current of 32.0 ± 8.0% (n = 7) and 37.3 ± 5.2%, respectively, which was not statistically different from the stimulation in the absence of the antibody (34.8 ± 5.7%,n = 7, Fig. 5, B and C). Similar results were obtained with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (0.1 µm) instead of PDBu (data not shown). The inactive isoform of PDBu (4α PDBu) did not stimulate the Ba2+current in the same batches of cells that were stimulated by PDBu (data not shown). These results suggest that the stimulatory effects of AII and Gβγ on L-type Ca2+ channels are mediated via activation of the PI3Kγ, which appears to be the upstream effector of PKC. In venous myocytes, AII has been reported to promote a Gβγ-mediated increase in [Ca2+]idepending on Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+channels without involving the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (5Morel J.L. Macrez-Lepretre N. Mironneau J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Macrez N. Morel J.L. Kalkbrenner F. Viard P. Schultz G. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23180-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The role of PI3Kγ in this cellular response was examined by using the anti-PI3Kγ antibody in [Ca2+]i measurements experiments. Application of 0.1 µm AII on single myocytes held at −50 mV induced a peak increase in [Ca2+]i of 98.5 ± 11.0 nm (n = 6, Fig.6A). When the PI3Kγ Ab was added to the pipette solution, the peak Ca2+ response activated by AII was strongly inhibited (27.5 ± 7.9 nm, n = 5), whereas it was not affected in the presence of the PI3Kα Ab (Fig. 6 A) or when the PI3Kγ Ab was preincubated with the antigenic peptide (data not shown). To test the possible alteration of ryanodine receptors by PI3Kγ Ab, caffeine, a pharmacological activator of ryanodine receptors, was tested on cells held at −50 mV. In the presence of the PI3Kγ Ab, caffeine (10 mm) induced an increase in [Ca2+]i that was not significantly different from that obtained in the absence of the antibody (data not shown). These results suggest that the AII-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration depends on the PI3Kγ-mediated stimulation of L-type Ca2+ channels. To check the ability of AII and Gβγ to stimulate endogenous PI3Kγ in venous myocytes, we measured PI 3,4,5-P3 production in the absence and presence of PI3Kγ Ab. In freshly prepared microsomes of vascular myocytes, AII (0.1 µm) or Gβγ (200 nm) applied for 15 s induced an increase in PI3K activity of 25.1 ± 3.9% (n = 3) and 76.1 ± 1.4%, respectively (Fig. 6 B). In the presence of LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, AII and Gβγ did not significantly change the basal activity of PI3K (Fig. 6 B). The stimulations of PI 3,4,5-P3 production by AII and Gβγ were strongly inhibited when microsomes were preincubated with the PI3Kγ Ab. These effects were largely reversed when the immunological activity of PI3Kγ Ab was blocked by the antigenic peptide (10 µg/ml; data not shown). These results indicate that AII and Gβγ stimulate PI 3,4,5-P3 production, which might be responsible for Ca2+ channel stimulation. Our results demonstrate the specific involvement of the γ isoform of the PI3K in the transduction pathway leading to calcium channel stimulation and the rise of [Ca2+]iinduced by AII in rat portal vein myocytes. This conclusion is based on experiments using specific antibodies raised against different PI3K isoforms. Western blot analysis revealed that rat portal vein myocytes expressed only PI3Kα and PI3Kγ and no other class I PI3K isoforms. Whereas PI3Kα has been shown to be widely expressed, PI3Kγ has been described first in neutrophils and exocrine glands (25Bernstein H.G. Keilhoff G. Reiser M. Freese S. Wetzker R. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 44: 973-983PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, expression of PI3Kγ has been reported in vascular endothelial cells (26Go Y.M. Park H. Maland M.C. Darley-Usmar V.M. Stoyanov B. Wetzker R. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1898-H1904PubMed Google Scholar), and we have now revealed its expression in vascular myocytes. PI3Kα and PI3Kβ have been reported to be ubiquitously and similarly expressed, because many tissues such as porcine aortic endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and colon cancer cells express both isoforms (19Roche S. Downward J. Raynal P. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7119-7129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,27Hooshmand-Rad R. Hajkova L. Klint P. Karlsson R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 207-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Benistant C. Chapuis H. Roche S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5083-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast, in vascular myocytes, the α but not the β isoform was detected either by immunochemistry or by Western blot experiments. Therefore, rat portal vein myocytes seem to display a specific pattern of PI3K isoform expression when compared with PC12 neurons, which express all class I PI3Ks (29Bartlett S.E. Reynolds A.J. Tan T. Heydon K. Hendry I.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Basically, the two PI3K isoforms expressed in portal vein myocytes could be involved in the regulation of calcium channel by AII. Indeed, AII acts on G protein-coupled receptors and generates free Gβγ dimers (6Macrez N. Morel J.L. Kalkbrenner F. Viard P. Schultz G. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23180-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but AII is also able to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation (30Watts S.W. Florian J.A. Monroe K.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286 (1418): 1431PubMed Google Scholar). The present study shows that only intracellular application of PI3Kγ Ab inhibited the AII-induced stimulation of calcium channel. This inhibition is specific, as this effect is reversed when the antibody is boiled or preincubated with the antigenic peptide used to produce the antibody. Furthermore, the PI3Kγ Ab recognized only one band in Western blot experiments performed on crude extract of myocytes and did not recognize recombinant PI3Kα. The specificity of the antibody was also shown at a functional level because PI3Kγ Ab inhibited the stimulatory effect of recombinant PI3Kγ on Ca2+ channel but did not inhibit the stimulatory effects of recombinant PI3Kα and phorbol ester. Involvement of a Gβγ-activated PI3K in the transduction pathway of AII has been suggested previously by Viard et al. (7Viard P. Exner T. Maier U. Mironneau J. Nurnberg B. Macrez N. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Here, we have clearly shown that both Gβγ dimer- and AII-induced Ca2+channel stimulation are blocked by the anti-PI3Kγ antibody, whereas anti-PI3Kα antibody did not affect the responses. Maier et al. (15Maier U. Babich A. Nurnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29311-29317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have reported that recombinant Gβ1γ2 dimer is able to activate PI3Kγin vitro. As Gβ1γ3 has been identified as the dimer involved in AII-induced stimulation of Ca2+ channels (6Macrez N. Morel J.L. Kalkbrenner F. Viard P. Schultz G. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23180-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we suggest that Gβ1γ3 is also able to stimulate PI3Kγ. The specificity of the anti-PI3Kγ antibody in inhibiting AII-induced regulation of Ca2+ channel, although exogenous PI3Kα and γ are both able to stimulate calcium channels, suggests that there is a specific pathway linking G protein-coupled receptor, endogenous PI3Kγ and Ca2+ channels. This specific coupling between a receptor and a PI3K isoform has also been described by Hooshmand-Radet al. (27Hooshmand-Rad R. Hajkova L. Klint P. Karlsson R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 207-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who reported that, in porcine aortic endothelial cells, platelet-derived growth factor stimulates actin reorganization through PI3Kα, whereas insulin reorganizes actin through PI3Kβ. Stimulation of Ca2+ channel by AII induces an increase in intracellular calcium concentration that mediates vascular contraction. This rise in intracellular calcium concentration is due to a calcium entry through L-type Ca2+ channels and a subsequent calcium release through ryanodine receptor channels (5Morel J.L. Macrez-Lepretre N. Mironneau J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have shown here that the PI3Kγ Ab inhibited the AII-induced increase in cytosolic calcium concentration. The effect of the antibody is not linked to an inhibition of ryanodine receptors or to a depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores because responses to caffeine, known to increase the open probability of ryanodine receptors, were not altered. In several vascular and nonvascular tissues, stimulation of ionic channels by PI3K via a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway has been described. However, in our experiments, the PI3Kα Ab, which specifically recognizes PI3Kα in Western blot experiments and inhibits the stimulatory effect of recombinant PI3Kα on Ca2+ channels, did not affect either the AII-mediated stimulation of Ca2+ channel or the rise in [Ca2+]i. These results suggest that the tyrosine kinase-activable PI3Kα is not involved in AII-stimulation of Ca2+ channel in our model. These results are consistent with our previous results (7Viard P. Exner T. Maier U. Mironneau J. Nurnberg B. Macrez N. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) but differ from those of Seki et al. (2Seki T. Yokoshiki H. Sunagawa M. Nakamura M. Sperelakis N. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 437: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which indicate that in a vascular cell line derived from embryonic rat aorta (A7r5), AII stimulates Ca2+ channels via a tyrosine kinase. In neuron, L- and N-type Ca2+channels are also stimulated by a tyrosine kinase-activated PI3K (31Blair L.A. Marshall J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Moreover, we report in the present study that high concentrations of recombinant PI3Kα may stimulate vascular calcium channels to the same extent that recombinant PI3Kγ. These results suggest that, depending on the cell type and the mediator, different endogenous PI3K isoforms may modulate Ca2+ channels. Concerning the potential role of PI3Kα in vascular myocytes, one may speculate that it could be involved in the long-lasting effects of AII. Indeed, in porcine coronary artery, AII induces tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation of p85 within 15 min (3Saward L. Zahradka P. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 249-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, further investigations are required to study the role of PI3Kα in rat portal vein myocytes. Because measurement of lipid kinase activity revealed that both AII- and Gβγ-stimulated PI 3,4,5-P3 productions were inhibited by LY294002 and the PI3Kγ Ab and because these inhibitory effects were reversed when PI3Kγ Ab was inactivated by the antigenic peptide, we conclude that AII and Gβγ increase the lipid-kinase activity of PI3Kγ in venous myocytes. The larger effect of Gβγ compared with that of AII in stimulating PI 3,4,5-P3production might be related to a larger concentration of exogenous Gβγ used when compared with the concentration of Gβγ endogenously produced upon AT1 receptor activation. This difference is correlated with a larger Ca2+ channel current stimulation by exogenous Gβγ than by AT1 receptor activation. PI 3,4,5-P3 messenger has been shown to directly activate or modulate ion channels (10Harvey J. McKay N.G. Walker K.S. Van der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Ashford M.L. J. Biol.

A MAP kinase inhibitor (PD98059) did not prevent the PI3Kγ-dependent stimulation of calcium channels, 2J.-F. Quignard, J. Mironneau, and N. Macrez, our unpublished results. whereas PKC inhibitors inhibit the effects of AII, Gβγ, and PI3K on Ca2+ channels in rat portal vein myocytes (4Macrez-Lepretre N. Morel J.L. Mironneau J. J.

Because PI 3,4,5-P3 may activate atypical PKCs (20Wang Y.X. Dhulipala P.D. Li L. Benovic J.L. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13859-13864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

However, the involvement of the serine-kinase activity of PI3K (35Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) in the AII-induced stimulation of Ca2+ channel cannot be excluded. In conclusion, the present study shows that despite the expression of both PI3Kα and PI3Kγ in rat portal vein myocytes, the AII-induced stimulation of L-type Ca2+ channels, and the rise of [Ca2+]i specifically involves the PI3Kγ.

Hence, they are a critical point of control for a variety of agents that modulate cellular function. Activation of these proteins is dependent on GTP binding to their α (Gα) subunits.

We report in this study the acute functional regulation of RGS10 thru the specific and inducible phosphorylation of RGS10 protein at serine 168 by cAMP-dependent kinase A. This phosphorylation nullifies the RGS10 activity at the plasma membrane, which controls the G protein-dependent activation of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel. Surprisingly, the phosphorylation-mediated attenuation of RGS10 activity was not manifested in an alteration of its ability to accelerate GTPase activity of Gα.

The activity of G proteins is regulated by a cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis catalyzed by the Gα subunits. In their inactive form, Gα subunits are bound to GDP and complexes with Gβγ subunits. Ligand-mediated activation of seven transmembrane receptors induces a conformational change in Gα subunits, which results in the dissociation of GDP from the Gα subunit. The relatively high endogenous concentration of intracellular GTP leads to its rapid binding to nucleotide-free Gα subunits. This results in the dissociation of GTP-Gα from both Gβγ subunit and receptor. Both the dissociated GTP-Gα and Gβγ subunits have the potential to regulate specific downstream target molecules and transduce ligand-mediated signals. Termination of the signal occurs upon hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gα subunit, resulting in the deactivation of Gα and promotion of Gβγ binding to Gα-GDP to re-form the inactive heterotrimeric complex. The discovery and characterization of the signaling properties of heterotrimeric G proteins revealed that the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα subunits in vitro was up to 100-fold slower than the rate of deactivation of some G protein-mediated signals in vivo. This paradox suggested that other factors were involved in mediating the increased rate of deactivation of the Gα protein. A novel family of proteins, RGS proteins, that regulateG protein signaling by an increase in the rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gα has recently been identified (1Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G.

To date, at least 27 mammalian RGS proteins have been identified on the basis of a conserved “RGS domain” (see reviews in Refs. 9De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar and 10Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The RGS protein family has been further divided into six subgroups based on a phylogenetic analysis (11Zheng B. De Vries L. Gist Farquhar M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 411-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). There are many questions about the involvement of RGS proteins in G protein-mediated signaling processes. One important question is whether RGS proteins are themselves regulated, perhaps by some type of dynamic post-translational modification such as protein palmitoylation and/or phosphorylation. Several RGS proteins (GAIP, RGS4, and RGS16) are palmitoylated at the amino terminus, which has been implicated in subcellular localization and membrane association (12De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), although the details of the relationship are unclear. Phosphorylation of Sst2p (yeast RGS protein) in yeast by Fus3p (mitogen-activated protein kinase) was reported to increase the half-life of Sst2p in yeast (15Garrison T.R. Zhang Y. Pausch M. Apanovitch D. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36387-36391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, biochemical pathways that might regulate the activities of RGS proteins (RGS10 in particular) in modulating G protein-coupled signaling were investigated. Compelling evidence has been obtained that the activity of RGS10 is regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation. Surprisingly, this attenuation of RGS10 activity was not manifested as a reduction in its ability to accelerate GTPase activity of Gα proteins but, instead, correlates with a translocation of the RGS into the nucleus. The RGS10-S168A clone was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (16Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). The mammalian expression vector for PKI was kindly provided by G. S. McKnight. All clones expressed in mammalian cells were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Bacterial expression plasmids for RGS10 proteins were constructed by subcloning RGS10 cDNA into the His tag fusion vector pRSETA (Invitrogen). Plasmids were transformed into the bacterial strain BL21 DE3(pLysS) and induced with 250 µmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h during exponential growth phase. Cells were lysed in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole (IMAC-25 buffer), and 0.1% Triton X-100 in the presence of a mixture of protease (Sigma) inhibitors, and then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 45 min. The supernatant was loaded on to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed with IMAC-25 buffer, and eluted with a linear gradient from 25 to 250 mm imidazole. The fractions containing the hexahistidine-tagged RGS10 proteins were then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm DTT. The dialyzed protein was then loaded on to an anion exchange column (MonoQ, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 300 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 5 mm DTT. The hexa-His-RGS10 purity was >95%, as determined by Coomassie Blue-stained protein gels. Hexahistidine-tagged RGS10 (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated with 180 units/ml catalytic subunit of PKA (New England Biolabs) at 30 °C for 15–120 min in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 200 µm ATP. For the autoradiographic studies, the reaction mixture was supplemented with γ-labeled ATP to a final specific activity of 200 µCi/µmol. RGS10 phosphorylation was assayed by gel-shift on a SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel) in the presence of reducing agents. The phospho-RGS10 was then separated from the PKA and nucleotides by MonoQ column using the same protocol described above. All tissue culture cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics unless otherwise indicated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. A Myc epitope tag (MEQKLISEEDL) was fused to the 5′ end of a cDNA fragment encoding RGS10 by site-directed mutagenesis (5Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 16Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Myc-RGS10 was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and used to transiently transfect human HEK 293 cells (5Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were lysed in buffer (PBS, 6 mmMgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) as described previously (5Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Binding of RGS10 to endogenous Gαi3 loaded with GDP or GDP and AlF 4− required the lysates to be incubated for 30 min at 20 °C in the presence of GDP (10 µm) or GDP (10 mm) and AlF 4− (30 µm). Loaded lysates were then precleared and immunoprecipitated as described previously (5Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-Gαi3 antibody (0.1 µg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and goat polyclonal anti-RGS10 antibody (0.1 µg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Equal RGS10 expression was determined by Western blot of the lysates with an anti-RGS10 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with RGS10 or RGS10-S168A were metabolically labeled (3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in phosphate-free DMEM, 1% dialyzed normal calf serum) with [32P]orthophosphate (100 µCi/100 µl) 24 h after transfection. The cells were then stimulated with 25 µmforskolin for 15 min at 37 °C. Whole cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-RGS10 antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography and immunoblotting as described above. Two-electrode voltage clamp was used to measure the currents from individual Xenopus oocytes immersed in Barth's solution at room temperature as described previously (17Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1145-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with a 50-nl solution containing cRNA of m2 muscarinic receptor, G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) 1, and GIRK 4. Twelve hours later, cRNA encoding RGS10wt or RGS10-S168A were also injected. Electrophysiological recordings were made 3 days after injection under two-electrode voltage clamp in a continuous flow chamber perfused with Barth's solution at room temperature. Oocytes were clamped at −60 mV. During each recording carbachol (2 µm) was applied to each oocyte for 20 s and then washed out with Barth's solution. Protein kinase A inhibitory peptide (PKI; Calbiochem; 50 nl of 0.2 µm dissolved in water) was injected into oocytes co-expressing the GIRK 1/4 channel combination, m2 muscarinic receptor, and, when indicated, with RGS10 30 min prior to recording. For oocytes stimulated with forskolin (Calbiochem; 25 µm dissolved in OR2, 82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.5), they were incubated in the forskolin-containing solution for 30 min prior to recording. All current activation and deactivation time constants were determined by fitting current trace to a Boltzman equation. Purified bovine brain Gαo (40 nm) (18Casey P.J. Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 611-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was loaded with GTP upon incubation with 1 µm [γ-32P]GTP (∼50,000 cpm/pmol) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.025% Lubrol; the stoichiometry of loading was 15–20%. Magnesium was excluded from the loading reactions to slow intrinsic GTP hydrolysis. Unbound GTP was removed by centrifuging (200 × g for 3 min at 4 °C) the reaction through 1 ml of G50 Sephadex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.7), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT. GTP-loaded Gαo (13 nm) was incubated for 3 min with or without RGS10 (50 nm), as indicated in the figure legend, in a total volume of 30 µl containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.7), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, 1.7 mm MgCl2, and 330 µmGTP. GTP hydrolysis was evaluated by quantitating the release of phosphate (19Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Sternweis P.C. Ross E.M. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 752-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells transiently expressing RGS10 were trypsinized and plated on sterile polylysine-coated coverslips and incubated overnight. Two hours prior to stimulation, the cells were placed in serum-free DMEM and then stimulated with forskolin (25 µm) as indicated. Cells were then washed in ice cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS on ice for 30 min, followed by three washes of PBS. The fixed cells were then blocked with 10% normal donkey serum in PBS on ice for 60 min followed by a single wash in PBS. The cells were then incubated in anti-RGS10 (1 µg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 1.5% normal donkey serum for 1–2 h at 4 °C, washed three times in PBS, and then incubated for 60 min with anti-goat IgG-FITC or IgG-rhodamine (1 µg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with 1.5% normal donkey serum. Coverslips were then washed three times in PBS, mounted on glass slides, and examined with a fluorescence confocal microscope. Regulation of signaling pathways by post-translational modifications that result in conformational change/or changes in localization of the signaling components is an almost universal phenomenon. To investigate whether human RGS10 might be regulated by post-translational modifications, the primary sequence of RGS10 was analyzed for potential sites of phosphorylation. RGS10 was found to contain one consensus PKA phosphorylation motif (Ser168) (Fig.1A). To explore whether PKA could directly phosphorylate RGS10, in vitro kinase assays were performed. A RGS10 derivative with an amino-terminal hexahistidine tag, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), was incubated in the presence of a recombinant catalytic subunit of PKA and [γ-32P]ATP. This study revealed that RGS10 was indeed phosphorylated by PKA (Fig.1 B, top panel, lane 1). To determine whether the Ser168 identified by primary amino acid sequence analysis was a unique PKA phosphorylation site, this residue was mutated to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. RGS10-S168A was not phosphorylated when incubated with the catalytic subunit of PKA (Fig. 1 B,top panel, lane 4), indicating that this residue was in fact the sole site of phosphorylation by PKA. Having found that RGS10 could serve as a substrate for PKA, we then assessed whether this specific phosphorylation could be detected in intact cells. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were transfected with RGS10 cDNA and subjected to 32P metabolic labeling. Phosphorylation of RGS10 was observed under these conditions (Fig. 1 C). Phosphorylation of RGS10 was induced by incubation of cells expressing RGS10 with forskolin (Fig.1 C, lane 4), providing evidence that the observed phosphorylation was a PKA-dependent event. Furthermore, co-expression of a dominant-negative PKA with RGS10 inhibited the forskolin-induced phosphorylation of RGS10 (Fig.1 C, lane 3). No PKA-inducible phosphorylation of the RGS10-S168A protein was observed, although there was some apparent background phosphorylation of RGS10 at site(s) other than the Ser168 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 5 and 6). RGS proteins are thought to function primarily as GTPase-activating proteins for heterotrimeric Gα subunits by specifically binding to the activated GTP-bound Gα and stabilizing the transition state for GTP hydrolysis (7Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 20Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed whether RGS10-S168A could physically associate with activated Gα by performing co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cells transfected with RGS10 or RGS10-S168A. To facilitate immunoprecipitation in these experiments, a 10-residue epitope tag derived from human Myc protein was inserted immediately after the initiation methionine of RGS10. Myc-RGS10 or Myc-RGS10-S168A was expressed by transient transfection of HEK293 cells. Proteins were recovered by immunoprecipitation of whole cell lysates treated with GDP or GDP and AlF 4− with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody, and analyzed by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody specific for the endogenous Gαi3. The Myc-RGS10 protein co-immunoprecipitated the Gαi3 protein from the whole cell lysates treated with GDP and AlF 4−(Fig. 1 D, lane 2), but failed to interact with wild-type Gαi3 from whole lysates treated with GDP (Fig. 1 D, lane 1). Similarly, Myc-RGS10-S168A co-immunoprecipitated only activated Gαi3protein (Fig. 1 D, lane 4). This finding confirmed that the S168A variant was produced as a functional protein and thus that its inability to serve as a substrate for PKA was not due to misfolding. Another possible post-translation modification that may impinge on RGS10 function is palmitoylation of Cys6 of RGS10, as has been reported previously for other RGS proteins, GAIP, RGS4, and RGS16 (12De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). RGS10 was transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitic acid. There was no evidence that immunoprecipitated RGS10 was palmitoylated (data not shown). GIRK channels are activated directly by Gβγ subunits released from G proteins of the Gαi family (21Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 22Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, discrepancies between native and recombinant GIRK channel kinetics activated by G protein-coupled receptors have also been reported (23Breitwieser G.E. Szabo G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 469-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C821-C830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have resolved this discrepancy by the demonstration of an acceleration of both activation and deactivation of GIRK 1/2 and GIRK 1/4 currents by several RGS proteins (25Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 26Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H.

Kubo Y. Odagiri M. Ichikawa M. Yamagata K. Sekine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9899-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We utilized GIRK channels to determine whether RGS10 was also capable of accelerating G protein-mediated modulation of GIRK currents. Copy RNAs encoding the m2 muscarinic receptor and GIRK 1/4 were co-expressed in X. laevis oocytes in the presence or absence of injected RGS10 cRNA. Three days after injection of the cRNAs, electrophysiological recordings were taken under two-electrode voltage clamp in a continuous flow chamber. RGS10 significantly accelerated GIRK 1/4 activation (2-fold) and deactivation (6-fold) kinetics following application of a m2 muscarinic receptor agonist (carbachol, 2 µm) to the bath for 20 s (Fig.2). The absolute time constants for activation (tau on) and deactivation (tau off) determined in this study are similar to those obtained from a rat atrial myocyte GIRK current (25Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), as well as for the time constants reported for GIRK 1/2 and GIRK 1/4 currents in the presence of RGS1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -7, and -8 (25Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 26Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H.

Kubo Y. Odagiri M. Ichikawa M. Yamagata K. Sekine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9899-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Acceleration of G protein-mediated modulation of GIRK current by RGS proteins provides an ideal model to study potential functional regulation of RGS proteins through post-translation modifications, such as the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of RGS10 observed here. To investigate the functional effect of preventing PKA-mediated phosphorylation of RGS10 on agonist-induced GIRK current kinetics, electrophysiological recordings were taken from oocytes co-expressing RGS10-S168A with m2 muscarinic receptor and GIRK 1/4 (Fig.2 A, bottom panel). When compared with control and RGS10wt, RGS10-S168A further accelerated GIRK 1/4 activation (3-fold, p < 0.05) and deactivation (14-fold, p < 0.05) kinetics following application of a m2 muscarinic receptor agonist (carbachol, 2 µm) to the bath for 20 s (Fig. 2). When compared with cells expressing wild-type RGS10, a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the rate of GIRK channel activation and deactivation was observed in oocytes expressing RGS10-S168A (Fig. 2 B). Western blot analysis of oocyte lysates showed no difference in the expression levels of wild-type RGS10 and the RGS10-S168A species (data not shown). The difference observed between wild-type RGS10 and RGS10-S168A on GIRK channel activation and deactivation kinetics is likely due to the high basal levels of PKA in X. laevis oocytes (29Hoffman P.W. Ravindran A. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4185-4195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that the phosphorylation status of Ser168 of RGS10 may modulate RGS10's molecular interaction with activated Gαi proteins. We next examined more directly whether PKA phosphorylation has a functional consequence on RGS10 action on GIRK channel kinetics by modulating PKA activity in oocytes with an activator (forskolin) and an inhibitor (PKI). Stimulation of PKA activity, by preincubation with forskolin of Xenopus oocytes co-expressing m2 muscarinic receptor, GIRK 1/4 channels, and RGS10 resulted in an inhibition of the apparent activity of the RGS as observed by the GIRK current trace (Fig. 3A, middle trace). Inhibition of PKA activity with PKI led to an apparent enhancement of RGS10 activity toward agonist-mediated GIRK current (Fig. 3 A, bottom trace). Furthermore, forskolin treatment inhibited the ability of RGS10 to accelerate the deactivation of GIRK channel currents in response to carbachol (Fig. 3 C, bar 2 versus bar 5). In contrast, introduction of PKI resulted in an apparent increase in RGS10's activity of accelerating both the activation (tau on) and deactivation (tau off) rates of GIRK current (Fig. 3, B and C,bar 2 versus bar 8). These changes in GIRK channel kinetics were only significantly observed when wild-type RGS10 was expressed in the oocyte. The tau off of GIRK current for oocytes co-expressing m2 muscarinic receptor, GIRK channel, and RGS10-S168A was increased in the presence of forskolin compared with the absence of forskolin (Fig.3 C, bar 3 versus bar 6). However, the rate of deactivation (tau off) was still significantly more rapid (>3-fold) than in oocytes not expressing RGS10 in the presence if forskolin (Fig. 3 C,bars 1 and 4 versus bar 6). Additionally, there was no significant change in the GIRK channel kinetics of oocytes expressing RGS10-S168A when PKI was introduced into the cell when compared with control cells lacking RGS10 (Fig. 3, B and C, bar 3 versus bar 9). No significant difference was observed between control and RGS10 groups (Fig. 3 B, bar 1 versus bar 2). We believe this lack of significance for tau on between control and RGS10 groups in Fig. 3 B is reflective of experimental variation between days, frogs, and oocyte injections. This variation may be a result of differences in oocyte endogenous PKA expression. The lack of significance, however, does not detract from the major observation of the effect of modulating of PKA activity on the tau off of m2 muscarinic receptor-evoked GIRK 1/4 current recorded from oocytes expressing wild-type RGS10. These data suggest that modulation of PKA activity directly affects the functional activity of RGS10 proteins on GIRK channel kinetics and that this modulation is mediated through phosphorylation of Ser168. To investigate whether phosphorylation of RGS10 by PKA modifies the ability of RGS10 to accelerate GTP hydrolysis by Gα proteins, we assayed the ability of phosphorylated RGS10 (in vitro by PKA) to potentiate the GTP hydrolysis rate of a Gα subunit in vitro (5Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Purified RGS10 was incubated with either the catalytic subunit of PKA or heat-inactivated catalytic subunit. Following each reaction, the RGS10 was separated from the PKA by anion-exchange chromatography. Phosphorylation of RGS10 by PKA resulted in a gel-shift on SDS-PAGE (Fig.4A, lane 2) that was not observed for RGS10 incubated with inactivated PKA (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), suggesting that the phosphorylation was stoichiometric. This phosphorylation had essentially no effect on RGS10's ability to accelerate the GTP hydrolysis rate of Gαο (Fig.4 B). To explore further if the ability of RGS10 to accelerate GTP hydrolysis of Gα was modified by phosphorylation of Ser168 by PKA, a time-course analysis was conducted (Fig.4 C). Addition of 50 nm RGS10 caused a >10-fold enhancement of the rate GTP hydrolysis by Gαo, and again this activity was unaffected by PKA phosphorylation of RGS10. Evidently, the effects of PKA dependent-phosphorylation of RGS10 on GIRK channel deactivation are not the result of a change in GAP activity of RGS10. The subcellular localization of various RGS proteins has been reported recently. RGS3, RGS7, and GAIP have been found to be cytosolic (30Cabrera J.L. de Freitas F. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Biochem.

Additionally, Chatterjee and Fisher (35Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) recently reported the accumulation of RGS2 and RGS10 in the nucleus of COS-7 cells transfected with green fluorescent protein constructs of these proteins. We examined the subcellular localization of RGS10 by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy after stable transfection into HEK293 cells. RGS10 was predominately localized in a diffuse manner in the cytosol (Fig. 5). However, treatment of cells with forskolin (25 µm for 2 h) resulted in a dramatic translocation of RGS10 from the cytosol to the nucleus (Fig. 5). The time points utilized for each approach were validated through carefully controlled experiments. For both the co-immunoprecipitation and electrophysiology studies, there was no observed difference between the 15- and 30-min time points (data not shown). Variability was observed with the immunolocalization studies, although we did always observe a discernible difference between the control and the 15-min forskolin stimulation time points (data not shown). However, the 2-h time points provided consistent results, and thus these data were chosen for presentation (Fig. 5). Investigation of the subcellular distribution of RGS10-S168A required transient transfection of HEK293, since numerous attempts to generate a cell line that stably expresses RGS10-S168A were all unsuccessful. Immunostaining for RGS10-S168A in transfected HEK293 cells revealed both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining (Fig. 5); however, no difference in the distribution of RGS10-S168A was observed when the cells were stimulated with forskolin (Fig. 5). Having found that RGS10 could translocate to the nucleus, we then assessed whether this localization could be detected in cells that endogenously express RGS10. To date endogenous RGS proteins had not been detected by immunostaining of cells, which suggests the endogenous expression of RGS proteins is very low. In H4 cells, there is predominately nuclear staining with some cytosolic staining, suggesting that most of the endogenous RGS10 protein is localized in the nucleus (data not shown; Ref. 35Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that nuclear localization of RGS10 is not a product of overexpression and is further supportive evidence of a functional role for RGS10 in the nucleus. These results, coupled with the PKA-mediated modulation of GIRK channel kinetics through RGS10 with minimal effect on its GAP activity, suggest that activation of PKA results in the translocation of RGS10 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where it can no longer participate in regulating Gα at the plasma membrane. Hence, we propose the model, as supported by our findings, that the phosphorylation-mediated attenuation of RGS10 activity (Figs. 2 and 3) was not manifest in an alteration of its ability to activate the GTPase of Gα (Fig. 4). Instead, the phosphorylation event triggered translocation of RGS10 from the plasma membrane and cytosol into the nucleus (Fig. 5). An alternative model, that PKA phosphorylation blocks export of RGS10 analogous to the nuclear shuttling of the yeast scaffold Ste5, was recently reported by Mahanty et al. (36Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, it still remains unclear as to whether the direct phosphorylation of RGS10 mediates this translocation or if an accessory protein is activated through PKA phosphorylation that is necessary for RGS10 translocation away from the plasma membrane. The discovery of RGS proteins provided a novel mechanism for the regulation of signaling through heterotrimeric G proteins, and has raised many questions. For example, knowledge of how RGS proteins are themselves regulated is likely to be crucial to the understanding their intrinsic functions. The goal of this work was to explore the potential regulation of RGS10 by covalent modification. We found that at least one such modification does indeed occur on RGS10, specifically phosphorylation by PKA. Even though the phosphorylation of RGS10 had a profound affect on its ability to modulate ion channel activation by G proteins, it did not have any effect on the ability of RGS10 to accelerate the GTPase activity of Gα subunits. Instead, the data indicate that PKA phosphorylation of RGS10 results in translocation of the proteins from the cytosol into the nucleus, which would result in the sequestration of RGS10 interactions with activated Gα subunits at the plasma membrane. Although the experiments described here do not address whether RGS10 has specific functions in the nucleus, the inability to generate stable cell lines expressing RGS10-S168A suggests that the phosphorylation of Ser168 may be critical in the functioning of RGS10. Although exploring potential functions of RGS10 in the nucleus is beyond the scope of this current study, our finding of the inducible translocation of RGS10 from the cytosol into the nucleus does suggest that the modulation of GAP activities alone does not constitute the only important target for biological regulation of RGS proteins.

Formation of the hMutLα·hMutSα·heteroduplex complex requires a mismatch and ATP hydrolysis, and depends on DNA chain length. Ternary complex formation was supported by a 200-base pair G-T heteroduplex, a 100-base pair substrate was somewhat less effective, and a 41-base pair heteroduplex was inactive. As judged by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, ternary complexes produced with the 200-base pair G-T DNA contained ∼0.8 mol of hMutLα/mol of heteroduplex-bound hMutSα. Although the steady-state levels of the hMutLα·hMutSα· heteroduplex were substantial, this complex was found to turn over, as judged by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and electrophoretic gel shift analysis. With the former method, the majority of the complexes dissociated rapidly upon termination of protein flow, and dissociation occurred in the latter case upon challenge with competitor DNA. However, ternary complex dissociation as monitored by gel shift assay was prevented if both ends of the heteroduplex were physically blocked with streptavidin·biotin complexes. This observation suggests that, like hMutSα, the hMutLα·hMutSα complex can migrate along the helix contour to dissociate at DNA ends.

In mammalian cells, MutSα (MSH2·MSH6 heterodimer), MutSβ (MSH2·MSH3 heterodimer), and MutLα (MLH1·PMS2 heterodimer) are also thought to function as lesion sensors for certain types of DNA damage that kill by activating apoptosis (2Modrich P.

Repair in the Escherichia coli system is initiated by the binding of MutS to a mismatch (8Su S.-S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Formation of a MutL·MutS·heteroduplex complex has been demonstrated by DNase I footprint analysis (11Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), electron microscopy (12Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2325-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), with assembly of this ternary complex being ATP-dependent. Several lines of evidence indicate that assembly of the ternary complex is required for subsequent steps in mismatch repair. Both MutS and MutL are required for the mismatch-dependent activation of the d(GATC) endonuclease activity of MutH, which cleaves the unmethylated strand of a hemimethylated d(GATC) site, with the ensuing strand break serving to direct repair to the unmethylated DNA strand (14Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MutS and MutL are also required for the mismatch-dependent activation of DNA helicase II, which enters the helix at the strand break and initiates the excision step of repair (15Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Formation of a MutLα·MutSα·heteroduplex complex has been demonstrated by electrophoretic gel shift analysis with yeast mismatch repair proteins using synthetic heteroduplexes of ∼50 base pairs (bp) in size (16Habraken Y.

However, using gel shift methods and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, we have consistently been unable to demonstrate the corresponding ternary complex between E. coli MutS and MutL or human MutSα and MutLα and synthetic heteroduplexes of similar size. 2D. Chandrasekhar, D. Allen, L. Blackwell, and P. Modrich, unpublished observations. This is despite the fact, as noted above, that footprint analysis, electron microscopy, and SPRS has indicated formation of a MutL·MutS·heteroduplex complex with the bacterial proteins (11Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D.

Since the latter experiments utilized heteroduplexes 140 bp or longer, we have examined the effect of DNA chain length on ternary complex formation using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and electrophoretic gel shift. We show here that efficient formation of the MutLα·MutSα·heteroduplex ternary complex is dependent on DNA chain length. We also show that ternary complex formation with the human proteins requires ATP, and probably its hydrolysis, and that these complexes turn over rapidly with respect to binding and release from the DNA. However, dissociation can be prevented and ternary complexes kinetically stabilized by placement of streptavidin blocks at both ends of a linear heteroduplex. hMutSα and hMutLα were prepared from baculovirus constructs expressing the appropriate human cDNAs in SF9 cells. The two subunits of hMutSα were expressed from a single virus constructed using the Dual Bac system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, hMSH2 cDNA (provided by Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD) was inserted into the NcoI site just downstream of the p10 promoter, while hMSH6 cDNA (a gift from Rick Fishel, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA) was expressed from the polyhedrin promoter by insertion between the BamHI and SalI sites. cDNAs for human MLH1 and PMS2 (generously provided by Mike Liskay, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR) were expressed from individual viral constructs prepared using the pFastBac I system (Life Technologies, Inc.). hMLH1was expressed from the polyhedrin promoter by insertion between the BamHI and NotI sites. hPMS2 was also expressed from the polyhedrin promoter after insertion between BamHI and XbaI sites. Infected SF9 cells for hMutSα isolation were grown by Kemp Biotechnologies, Inc. (Frederick, MD). Frozen cell pellets were thawed and suspended (10 ml/g of cells) in 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol containing 1 µg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and E64 (Peptides International). Cells were lysed with five strokes of a Dounce B pestle, and the extract supplemented with KCl to 200 mm. After centrifugation (30,000 × g, 15 min), hMutSα was isolated from the supernatant by minor modifications of the method used previously for isolation of the HeLa cell activity (18Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Recombinant hMutSα preparations obtained in this manner had a purity of 98% or better, were characterized by a 1:1 subunit stoichiometry, and were fully active in mismatch repair as judged by in vitrocomplementation of nuclear extracts derived from MSH2-deficient human cells. For hMutLα purification, SF9 cells were continuously cultured in 800 ml of serum-free HyQ-SFX medium (HyClone, Inc.) at 27 °C in 2.8-liter Fernbach flasks. When culture density reached 1 × 106/ml, cells were co-infected with hMLH1 and hPMS2 baculovirus constructs at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Infected cells were harvested 60 h later by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall RC-3B centrifuge. Cell pellets were suspended in 120 ml of 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.6, 5 mmKCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 containing 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (relative to a saturated solution in isopropanol) and 1 µg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and E64. After incubation on ice for 10 min, cells were lysed with 20 strokes using a Dounce B pestle, the suspension adjusted to 100 mm KCl, and then clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C (fraction I). Forty ml of fraction I was thawed and loaded at 4 °C onto a 5-ml heparin HiTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol at flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. After wash with starting buffer, the column was eluted with a 60-ml gradient of KCl (100–450 mm) in 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. hMutLα fractions, which eluted at ∼230 mmKCl, were diluted to 80 mm KCl with 20 mmKPO4, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol (buffer A) containing 80 mm KCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After wash with starting buffer, the column was eluted with a 20 ml gradient of KCl (80–380 mm) in buffer A. hMutLα fractions, which eluted at ∼220 mm KCl, were diluted to 80 mm KCl with buffer A and loaded onto a Mono S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A containing 80 mm KCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After wash with starting buffer, the column was eluted with a 20-ml KCl gradient (80–380 mm) in buffer A. hMutLα fractions, which eluted at ∼150 mm KCl, were pooled, and aliquots frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Purification from 40 ml of extract yielded 1.6 mg of hMutLα with an MLH1:PMS2 subunit ratio of 1:1 and an estimated purity of 98%. Activity of such preparations are comparable to that of hMutLα isolated from HeLa cells (19Li G.-M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), as judged by in vitro complementation of nuclear extracts derived from cells deficient in hMLH1. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR), and when indicated were radiolabeled at the 5′-terminus with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to a specific activity of 1 × 106 cpm/pmol. Poly d(I)·d(C) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A 41-bp G-T heteroduplex used for gel shift analysis was prepared by mixing, in a 100-µl volume, 80 nm top strand 5-32P-d(AGCCGAATTTTTAGACTCGATAGCTTGCTAGCAATTCGGCG) with 120 nm unlabeled bottom strand 5′-biotin-d(CGCCGAATTGCTAGCAAGCTGTCGAGTCTAAAAATTCGGCT). Strands were annealed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, and 150 mm NaCl by heating at 99 °C in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Gene Amp 9600 thermocycler for 2 min and cooling to 25 °C over a period of 90 min. The corresponding A·T homoduplex was prepared in a similar manner by annealing 5′-biotin-d(CGCCGAATTGCTAGCAAGCTATCGAGTCTAAAAATTCGGCT) with the top strand above. Identical 41-bp substrates were prepared for SPRS by annealing 1 µm each of top and bottom strands described above in a 100-µl volume. These 41-bp DNAs correspond to coordinates 5612–5652 of the f1MR phage DNAs used for preparation of in vitro mismatch repair substrates (9Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCR-derived 200-bp G-T heteroduplex and homoduplex DNAs were prepared after strand separation by denaturing HPLC as described previously (20Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, a biotinylated viral strand sequence obtained by strand separation of a 200-bp PCR product derived from phage f1MR1 (0.3 µm) was annealed in 100 µl with 0.2 µm200-nucleotide, 32P-labeled complementary strand sequence derived by PCR from f1MR1 or f1MR3 (9Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Duplexes were annealed as described above. Non-radioactive 200-bp homoduplex and heteroduplex DNAs for SPRS were prepared in a similar manner by annealing 0.5 µm 5′-biotinylated f1MR1 viral strand sequence with 0.5 µm complementary strand sequence derived from f1MR1 or f1MR3. 100-bp homoduplex and G-T heteroduplexes used for gel shift analysis were prepared by denaturing HPLC strand separation of a 150-bp PCR product derived from coordinates 5582–5732 of bacteriophages f1MR1 and f1MR3 (9Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Forward and reverse primers for PCR were d(CGCTTTCTTCCCTTCCTTTCTCG) and d(AAGTTTTTTGGGGTCGAGGT). The32P-labeled, 150-residue viral strand sequence from f1MR1 was combined with the complementary sequence (0.45 µmeach in 100 µl) prepared from f1MR1 or f1MR3 to yield homoduplex or G-T heteroduplex, respectively. DNAs were annealed as described above in 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. Resulting duplexes were cleaved with 20 units ofBanII for 1 h at 37 °C. After dilution to 400 µl with buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA) containing 300 mm NaCl, the DNA was loaded onto a Gen-Pak Fax column (4.6 × 100 mm) equilibrated with this buffer at a flow rate of 0.55 ml/min. After washing 5 min with buffer B containing 0.3 m NaCl, the DNA was eluted with a gradient of NaCl (0.3–1 m) in buffer B over a 35-min period. 5′-Biotinylated 110-bp DNAs for surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy were prepared in a similar manner from PCR products derived from region 5570–5732 of f1MR1 and f1MR3 using the same reverse primer described above and 5′-biotin-d(GCCCGCTCCTTTCGCTTTCT) as forward primer. The biotinylated viral strand sequence from f1MR1 was annealed with the complementary strand sequence (1 µm each in 100 µl) prepared from f1MR1 or f1MR3, subjected to BanII cleavage, and the 110-bp heteroduplex and homoduplex purified as described above. 3′-32P-Labeled 200 bp homoduplex and heteroduplex DNAs that were tagged with 5′-biotin at both ends were prepared as described previously (20Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). DNA binding reactions (20 µl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 nm[32P]homoduplex or [32P]heteroduplex DNA (as indicated), 25 µg/ml BstEII digest of bacteriophage λ DNA (New England Biolabs), and ATP as indicated. Solutions were prewarmed to 25 °C for 10 min and reactions initiated by addition of hMutSα and hMutLα as indicated. After incubation for 10 min at 25 °C, reactions were stopped by addition of 2 µl of 50% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 20 mm EDTA, placed on ice, and then loaded onto a 4% native polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide-bisacrylamide, 37.5:1) in 6.7 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA. Gels were electrophoresed at room temperature at 11.4 V/cm in this buffer.32P-Labeled complexes were visualized by autoradiography after drying. A nitrocellulose membrane was placed on polyacrylamide gels and a NA45 DEAE-cellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) placed on top of the nitrocellulose. Protein and DNA were then electrophoretically transferred in 50 mm Tris, 376 mm glycine, and 20% methanol for 1 h at 100V. Under these conditions proteins are retained by the nitrocellulose, but DNA passes through to be retained on the DEAE membrane. Radiolabeled DNA was visualized by autoradiography of the DEAE membrane. Mismatch repair polypeptides were identified by Western blot using monoclonal anti-hMLH1 (PharMingen), monoclonal anti-hPMS2 (PharMingen), monoclonal anti-hMSH2 (Calbiochem), or goat anti-MSH6 (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk) for 30 min, followed by a 1-h incubation with the appropriate antibody diluted 1/500 into blocking buffer. After three 10-min washes with blocking buffer, membranes were incubated for 30 min with a 1/500 dilution of anti-mouse Ig horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or anti-goat IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) as appropriate. Immune complexes were detected by ECL. When indicated nitrocellulose membranes were stripped by incubating a 65 °C for 4 h in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate. After washing three times for 10 min with blocking buffer, the membrane was probed with a second antibody. Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed on a BIAcore 2000. Streptavidin sensor chips were derivatized with the 41-, 110-, and 200-bp homoduplex or G-T heteroduplex DNAs described above, in which one strand was tagged with a 5′-terminal biotin. Solutions contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% surfactant P20, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl and ATP, and hMutSα and hMutLα as indicated. Measurements were performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 20 µl/min, and samples were maintained at 4 °C prior to injection.

This value was calculated from the mass ratio, which is given by (RUexp)/(0.79 × RUDNA), where RUexp is the output signal due to protein binding and RUDNA corresponds to the amount of DNA bound to the chip in resonance units. The factor 0.79 corrects for the fact that the refractive index increment for a typical protein is 79% of that obtained with an equivalent mass of DNA (25Fisher R.J. Fivash M. Casas-Finet J. Bladen S. McNitt K.L. Methods. 1994; 6: 121-133Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Massratio values were converted to molar ratios using the molecular weights of the DNA and protein in question. Since this method is based on several assumptions (for example, that the relative refractive index increment cited above is generally valid and that all chip-bound DNA is equally accessible to protein flow), it can only be regarded as approximate. However, we have also used this method to estimate relative binding stoichiometries of hMutSα and hMutLα in ternary complexes with DNA, and these values should be quite accurate. Ternary complexes of yeast MutSα and MutLα with synthetic heteroduplexes of ∼50 bp in size have been demonstrated by electrophoretic gel shift (16Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9837-9841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Bowers J. Tran P.T. Joshi A. Liskay R.M. Alani E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 957-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, we have been unable to reproducibly detect ternary complexes involving bacterial MutS and MutL, or human MutSα and MutLα, utilizing synthetic heteroduplexes 41 bp in length. Since there is abundant evidence for ternary complex formation between the bacterial mismatch repair proteins and heteroduplexes of 143 bp or longer (11Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2325-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we reasoned that this problem might be due to the small size of synthetic heteroduplexes. Using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, specific binding of hMutSα to a 200-bp G-T heteroduplex (see “Experimental Procedures”) was evident in the presence of ATP·Mg2+, with the heteroduplex signal approximately 3 times that observed with an otherwise identical A·T homoduplex (Fig.1). Although hMutLα did not bind detectably to the 200-bp heteroduplex under these conditions, passage of a mixture of hMutSα and hMutLα over the chip resulted in a substantial enhancement of the mass of heteroduplex-bound protein, as compared with that observed with hMutSα alone. This mass enhancement is mismatch-dependent since it was not observed with the A·T homoduplex control, and experiments described below demonstrate that it is not a simple consquence of increased hMutSα binding due to presence of hMutLα. This effect requires the simultaneous presence of hMutSα and hMutLα since no enhancement of heteroduplex-bound protein was observed in experiments in which the two proteins were passed over the chip in a sequential manner (data not shown). The hMutLα-dependent mass enhancement was only observed in the presence of ATP, where it displayed a strong dependence on DNA chain length (Fig. 2). In the absence of ATP (lower panel), ∼1 hMutSα heterodimer was bound/41-bp G-T heteroduplex, and this value increased to approximately two equivalents with the 200-bp heteroduplex. Under these conditions in the absence of ATP, the protein mass bound by 41-, 100-, and 200-bp heteroduplexes was unaffected by inclusion of hMutLα along with hMutSα, as compared with that observed with hMutSα alone. As observed previously (18Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 20Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P.

Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), the presence of ATP resulted in a dramatic reduction in hMutSα binding to the 41-bp heteroduplex, and the presence of hMutLα was without effect (Fig. 2, compareupper and lower panels). However, the extent of hMutSα binding to 100- and 200-bp heteroduplexes in the presence of ATP was similar to that observed in the absence of nucleotide, and the presence of hMutLα resulted in a substantial enhancement of protein mass bound by these two heteroduplex DNAs. Based on experiments described below, and previous observations with bacterial and yeast mismatch repair proteins (11Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D.

Biol. 2001; 306: 957-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we have concluded that this enhancement of heteroduplex-bound protein mass reflects mismatch-, ATP-, and hMutSα-dependent presence of hMutLα in a nucleoprotein complex with heteroduplex DNA. The stoichiometries of formation of this hMutLα·hMutSα·heteroduplex ternary complex will be considered below. Ternary complex formation was demonstrable in the presence of ATP·Mg2+, but we have been unable to detect a hMutLα-dependent increase in the mass of heteroduplex-bound protein in the presence of AMPPNP·Mg2+(data not shown). This finding, which is similar to previous observations with bacterial MutS and MutL (13Galio L. Bouquet C. Brooks P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2325-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), strongly suggests that ternary complex formation is dependent upon ATP hydrolysis by one or both proteins. Ternary complex formation requires ATP·Mg2+, conditions that reduce the affinity of hMutSα for a mispair (18Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 20Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The apparent specific affinity of hMutSα for the 200-bp G-T heteroduplex and A·T homoduplex in the presence of ATP was estimated by SPRS (Fig. 3,upper panel). Under these conditions, hMutSα·heteroduplex and hMutSα·homoduplex formation was hyperbolic, with apparent K d values of 205 and 420 nm, respectively. These data were also evaluated after subtraction of the hMutSα·homoduplex values from those observed with the heteroduplex in order to correct interactions with heteroduplex for mismatch-independent binding. Correction in this manner also yielded an excellent hyperbolic fit with an apparentK d of 140 nm and an asymptotic value of 3 equivalents of the MSH2·MSH6 heterodimer bound per DNA at saturation (Fig. 3, upper panel). Although the stoichiometry of hMutSα·heteroduplex formation calculated from SPRS can be regarded as only approximate (see “Experimental Procedures”), the finding that the limiting stoichiometry of heteroduplex binding exceeds unity, even after correction for homoduplex effects, may seem surprising given that the DNA contains a single mismatch. There are several possible explanations for this effect. For example, multiple copies of hMutSα may oligomerize on a heteroduplex in a mismatch-dependent reaction. A sec"

SREBP-1c introduced into primary hepatocytes with an adenovirus vector caused a total loss of PEPCK-C mRNA and a marked induction of fatty acid synthase mRNA that directly coincided with the appearance of SREBP-1c in the hepatocytes. It also blocked the induction of PEPCK-C mRNA by cAMP and dexamethasone in these cells. In contrast, a dominant negative form of SREBP-1c (dnSREBP-1c) stimulated the accumulation of PEPCK-C mRNA in these cells. SREBP-1c completely blocked the induction of PEPCK-C gene transcription by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), and increasing concentrations of dnSREBP-1c reversed the negative effect of insulin on transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter in WT-IR cells. The more than 10-fold induction of PKA-stimulated PEPCK-C gene transcription caused by the co-activator CBP, was also blocked by SREBP-1c. In addition, dnSREBP-1c reversed the strong negative effect of E1A and NF1 on PKA-stimulated transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter. An analysis of the possible site of action of SREBP-1c using stepwise truncations of the PEPCK-C gene promoter indicated that the negative effect of SREBP-1c on transcription is exerted at a site between −355 and −277. We conclude that SREBP-1c is an intermediate in the action of insulin on PEPCK-C gene transcription in the liver and acts by blocking the stimulatory effect cAMP that is mediated via an interaction with cAMP-binding protein.

Insulin markedly inhibits PEPCK-C gene transcription, even in the presence of cAMP; the half-time of this inhibition is ∼30 min (1Granner D.K. Andreone T. Sasaki K. Beale E. Nature. 1983; 305: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Despite its profound effects, the mechanism of insulin action on transcription of the gene for PEPCK-C remains surprisingly elusive. A region of the PEPCK-C gene promoter termed an insulin regulatory sequence (IRS) (−420 to −402) has been identified. This sequence confers partial insulin sensitivity to heterologous promoters (2O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnunson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and several proteins that bind to the IRS have been proposed to have a role in the insulin control of PEPCK-C gene transcription (3O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.-C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, to date, transcription factors or regulatory elements in the promoter that account for the strong negative effects of insulin on hepatic PEPCK-C gene transcription have not been identified. Recently, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) has been proposed as a key intermediate in the action of insulin on genes coding for proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism (4Azzout-Marniche D. Becard D. Guichard C. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We reported that SREBP-1c cDNA introduced into hepatocytes via an adenoviral vector induces glucokinase and other insulin-induced gene mRNAs (fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and Spot 14) (4Azzout-Marniche D. Becard D. Guichard C. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 5Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The dominant negative form of SREBP-1c (dnSREBP-1c) blocked the ability of insulin to induce the expression of the glucokinase gene (4Azzout-Marniche D. Becard D. Guichard C. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar,5Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). SREBP-1c is a member of a larger family of transcription factors, termed SREBPs, that were first discovered based on their involvement in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism (6Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). A precursor form of SREBP-1 is synthesized and immediately anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes (7DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 1999; 99: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of the precursor generates a mature, active form of the transcription factor that migrates into the nucleus, where it can bind both sterol regulatory elements (5′-TCACCCCCCAC-3′) and E-boxes (5′-CANNTG-3′) (8Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar, 9Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) in the promoters of specific genes. For proteolytic cleavage to occur, SREBPs must be transported to a site in the Golgi complex by the action of a protein termed SREBP cleavage-activating protein (10Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the precursor form of SREBP involves two proteolytic enzymes, the first of which is regulated by SREBP cleavage-activating protein (11Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5785-5793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and is sensitive to the concentration of sterols in the cell (12Yang T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29881-29886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). There is no evidence that SREBP-1c is activated by sterols in a similar manner. It has been shown previously, using cultured rat hepatocytes, that SREBP-1c gene expression is transcriptionally stimulated by insulin and repressed by glucagon (5Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). SREBP-1c has also been implicated in the effect of insulin on the genes for the low density lipoprotein receptor (13Liu J. Ahlborn T.E. Briggs M.R. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5214-5221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Bennett M.K. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested from in vivo studies in mice and in vitro studies in adipocyte cell lines (15Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) (16Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) that the nuclear concentration of SREBP-1c is enhanced by insulin. Finally, indirect evidence suggests that SREBP-1c could be a target of mitogen-activated protein kinase, a known intermediate of insulin action (17Kotzka J. Muller-Wieland D. Koponen A. Njamen D. Kremer L. Roth G. Munck M. Knebel B. Krone W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hence, insulin could influence SREBP-1c in three ways; it could (a) increase transcription of the gene for SREBP-1c, (b) increase the mobilization of SREBP-1c to the nucleus, and (c) alter the transcriptional activity of SREBP-1c once the protein is in the nucleus. Despite the current interest in SREBP-1c as a potential regulatory factor in the pathway of insulin action in the liver, its involvement in the regulation of transcription of genes involved in the control of hepatic gluconeogenesis has not been well established. In this paper, we show that SREBP-1c markedly reduces the basal level of PEPCK-C mRNA in isolated hepatocytes and blocks cAMP and dexamethasone-induced transcription from the PEPCK-C gene. In addition, a dominant negative form of SREBP-1c stimulated basal PEPCK-C gene expression in hepatocytes and overcame the negative effect of insulin on basal transcription of PEPCK-C gene. Our findings suggest that SREBP-1c exerts its effect by blocking the interaction of specific transcription factors involved in the cAMP regulation of PEPCK-C gene transcription with CBP. We conclude that SREBP-1c is an intermediate in the action of insulin on PEPCK-C gene transcription in the liver. Luciferase assay reagents were purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI).

The plasmid p2000 luc was generated by ligating the XbaI and BglII fragment of the PEPCK-C gene promoter into pGL2-basic (which contains the luciferase structural gene) that had been digested with NheI andBglII. The plasmids were isolated with Plasmid Mini or Qiafilter Midi Kits (Qiagen, Inc.) and checked for purity by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels, followed by visualization under UV light. The deletions in the PEPCK-C gene promoter (68Luc, 109Luc, 134Luc, 174Luc, 277Luc, and 355Luc) were from Short et al. (19Short J.M. Wynshaw-Boris A. Short H.P. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9721-9726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These segments of the PEPCK-C gene promoter were ligated to the luciferase structural gene by digestion with BglII and KpnI. After verification of the appropriate size ligated product, the DNA was transformed in the DH5α Escherichia coli strain. A plasmid miniprep was conducted using the Qiagen Mini-Prep Kit, and the DNA was isolated. The isolated product was redigested with the same enzymes to verify the in-frame insertion of the PEPCK-C gene promoter fragments. HepG2 hepatoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, supplemented with 50% F-12 nutrient mixture (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 and 10% fetal calf serum) and antibiotics (50 units of penicillin and 50 μg of streptomycin per ml) at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere in six-well plates for 24 h before transfection. WT-IR cells were passaged at 33 °C in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 4% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 10 mm dexamethasone, and after transfection the cells were transferred to 37 °C, with similar conditions as mentioned above. The cells (1 × 105 cells in 2 ml of medium/well) were then transfected with plasmid DNA (1 μg of plasmid DNA to 4.5 μl of FuGENE-6 transfection reagent per 35-mm well) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 24 h, the cells were washed with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and lysed by the addition of 300 μl of 1× Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). The lysate was collected and centrifuged in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes for 6 min at 12,000 × g. The cell lysate was separated from the pellet and used for measurement of protein concentration and luciferase activity. For luciferase activity, 10 μl of the cell lysate was used to measure the integrated light units over 10 s, using the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and a luminometer (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA) as recommended by the manufacturers. The protein content of the extracts was determined by the dc-Bio-Rad protein assay method, using several concentrations of bovine serum albumin in cell lysis buffer as a standard. Animal studies were conducted according to the French guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. Female (200–300-g body weight) Wistar rats from Iffa-Credo (L'Arbresle, France) were used for isolation of hepatocytes. They were housed in plastic cages at a constant temperature (22 °C) with light from 0700 to 1900 h for at least 1 week before the experiments. The adenovirus vector containing the transcriptionally active amino-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–403) of SREBP-1c was constructed as described previously (20Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA of the transcriptionally active fragment of SREBP-1c cDNA was subcloned into the shuttle vector pAd Track-CMV. The resultant plasmid was linearized by the restriction endonucleasePmeI and co-transformed with the supercoiled adenoviral vector pAd-Easy1 into E. coli strain BJ5183. Recombinants were selected by kanamycin resistance and screened by restriction endonuclease digestion. The recombinant adenoviral construct was then cleaved with PacI and transfected into the packaging cell line 293. The recombinant adenovirus containing the dominant negative form of SREBP-1c was constructed as described previously (5Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The adenovirus vector containing the major late promoter with no exogenous gene (Ad null) was used as a control. The adenoviral vectors were propagated in 293 cells, purified by cesium chloride density centrifugation, and stored as previously described (5Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were isolated from rats by the collagenase method (21Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). Cell viability was assessed by the Trypan blue exclusion test and was always higher than 85%. Hepatocytes were seeded at a density of 8 × 106 cells/dish in 100-mm Petri dishes in medium M199 with Earle's salts (Life Technologies) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 2% (v/v) Ultroser G (Life Technologies), 100 nm dexamethasone (Sigma), 1 nm insulin (Actrapid; Novo Nordisc, Copenhagen, Denmark), 100 nmtriiodothyronine (Sigma). After cell attachment (4 h), cells were cultured in various conditions as described in the legends to Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4.Figure 1Time course of the effect of SREBP-1c introduced into rat hepatocytes with an adenoviral vector on the concentration of mRNA for PEPCK-C and fatty acid synthase.Hepatocytes from rats were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The hepatocytes were maintained in culture for 16 h after cell attachment in the presence of 5 mm glucose, and where indicated, adenovirus was added at 1 plaque-forming unit (pfu)/cell. At various times after infection with the adenovirus, the cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted and hybridized with cDNAs for PEPCK-C, fatty acid synthase (FAS), and SREBP-1c (SREBP-1c-403). Details of the methods used for Northern blot analysis are presented under “Experimental Procedures.” The Northern blots shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For the experiments involving adenoviruses, hepatocytes were cultured for 16 h after cell attachment and then incubated for 120 min at 37 °C in M199 either with or without adenovirus containing SREBP-1c or dnSREBP-1c at various titers (plaque-forming units). Fresh medium was then added, and the cells were maintained in culture for the times described in the legends to Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4. To determine the effects of SREBP-1c on cAMP or dexamethasone-stimulated PEPCK-C gene expression in hepatocytes, 0.1 mm Bt2cAMP or 0.1 mmdexamethasone was added to the cells after attachment and incubated in the presence of 5 mm glucose for 16 h. Total cellular RNA was extracted from cultured hepatocytes using the guanidine thiocyanate method (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) and prepared for Northern blot hybridization as previously described (5Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C.

Labeling of each DNA probe with [α-32P]dCTP was performed by random priming (Rediprime labeling kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Autoradiograms of Northern blots were scanned using an image processor program. The cDNA probes used to determine the levels of mRNA for fatty acid synthase (FAS), albumin, SREBP-1c, and PEPCK-C were used as previously described (20Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The cDNA for angiotensinogen from the rat was purchased from ATCC. The effect of overexpressing the cDNA for SREBP-1c on the level of expression of the gene for PEPCK-C was assessed by infecting isolated primary rat hepatocytes with an adenoviral vector expressing this transcription factor and measuring the concentration of mRNA for PEPCK-C, fatty acid synthase, and SREBP-1c at varying times after infection. SREBP-1c mRNA appeared in the hepatocytes within 4 h of viral infection, and its accumulation corresponded directly to a decrease in the level of PEPCK-C mRNA; there was a reciprocal increase in the concentration of mRNA for fatty acid synthase (Fig.1). Within 10 h after the introduction of SREBP-1c, PEPCK-C mRNA was virtually undetectable in the hepatocytes. The effect of SREBP-1c on PEPCK-C gene expression did not require glucose in the incubation medium of the infected hepatocytes, since there was an equally robust decline in PEPCK-C mRNA with either 5 or 25 mm glucose or with 5 mm lactate/pyruvate as substrate (Fig.2). Interestingly, the level of PEPCK-C mRNA was lower in hepatocytes incubated with 25 mmglucose, supporting the observation that transcription of the gene for PEPCK-C is inhibited at high concentrations of glucose (23Scott D.K. O'Doherty R.M. Stafford J.M. Newgard C.B. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24145-24151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,24Cournarie F. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The dominant negative form of SREBP-1c dimerizes with the dominant positive form of SREBP-1c, thereby sequestering the active transcription factor. dnSREBP-1c increased the concentration of PEPCK-C mRNA in the primary hepatocytes in the absence of added cAMP; it had no effect, however, on the level of albumin mRNA (Fig.3). We conclude that SREBP-1c dramatically decreases PEPCK-C mRNA in hepatocytes in a concentration-dependent manner and that it is involved in maintaining the low basal level of PEPCK-C gene expression in the liver. Finally, SREBP-1c completely blocked the cAMP-induced increase in expression of the gene for PEPCK-C in hepatocytes after 16 h of incubation; it decreased the observed PEPCK-C mRNA to undetectable levels (Fig. 4). A similar inhibitory effect of SREBP-1c was noted on the normal induction of transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter by dexamethasone (data not shown). The long term effects of both cAMP and dexamethasone on the accumulation of PEPCK-C mRNA in hepatocytes suggest that these compounds act to stabilize the mRNA as well as stimulate gene transcription. The inhibitory effect of SREBP-1c on PEPCK-C gene expression in hepatocytes and the strong stimulation of the basal transcription of this gene by dnSREBP-1c suggested that SREBP-1c had a insulin-like action on transcription of the PEPCK-C gene. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effects of overexpressing a cDNA for SREBP-1c on basal and PKA-stimulated transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter (−2000 to +73) that was linked to the luciferase structural gene (Fig.5). SREBP-1c had no effect on the low level of basal transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter in HepG2 cells but blocked PKA-induced transcription from that promoter in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5). At equivalent levels of DNA (0.5 mg), SREBP-1c caused a 60% inhibition of transcription, even in the presence of a strong stimulation of PEPCK-C gene transcription by PKA (Fig. 5). At higher concentrations of SREBP-1c cDNA, the inhibition of transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter was 90%. In contrast, the dominant negative form of SREBP-1c (dnSREBP-1c) greatly induced both basal and PKA-stimulated transcription in this system. The effect was dependent on the concentration of the dnSREBP-1c cDNA transfected with the PEPCK-C gene promoter (Fig. 5). The effect of SREBP-1c on PEPCK-C gene transcription parallels the strong negative effect of insulin (i.e. it markedly inhibits PEPCK-C gene transcription even in the presence of the major stimulatory action of PKA). SREBP-1c, like insulin, acts in a dominant negative fashion on PEPCK gene transcription. We next used WT-IR cells to test the effect of insulin in the presence and absence of SREBP-1c on transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter (Fig.6). WT-IR cells were used in this experiment, since, unlike HepG2 cells, they have been shown to respond to added insulin (18Rother K.I. Imai Y. Caruso M. Beguinot F. Formisano P. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17491-17497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We determined the concentration of mRNA for SREBP-1c in these cells using “real time” RT-PCR and noted that there was 5.8 pg of SREBP-1c/mg of total RNA. This compared with 1 pg of SREBP-1c in the liver of a starved mouse. We could not detect SREBP-1c mRNA in HepG2 cells. Increasing concentrations of insulin added to WT-IR cells caused the expected decrease in transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter, even in the presence of PKA. Co-transfection of dnSREBP-1c in the presence of 0.12 mm insulin resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter. Thus, the negative effect of insulin on both basal and PKA-stimulated transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter could be completely reversed by transfecting the WT-IR cells with increasing concentrations of dnSREBP-1c. The regulation of PEPCK-C gene transcription by cAMP involves the transcriptional co-activator CBP (25Leahy P. Crawford D.R. Grossman G. Chaudhry A. Gronostajski R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8813-8822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Several of the transcription factors that mediate the effect of cAMP on PEPCK-C gene expression have been shown to act by binding to specific regions of CBP (25Leahy P. Crawford D.R. Grossman G. Chaudhry A. Gronostajski R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8813-8822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26Cardinaux J.R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q. Vo N. Craig J.C.

Since SREBP-1c inhibits PKA-induced transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter and also binds to CBP, it is reasonable to assume that it might interfere with the interaction of transcription factors such as C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, CREB, or CREM with CBP (28Oliner J.D. Andresen J.M. Hansen S.K. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). CBP stimulates transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter in the presence of PKA but does not alter basal transcription (Fig.7). SREBP-1c totally blocks this inductive effect and returns the level of transcription to that noted with PKA alone but not to basal levels. This suggests that SREBP-1c interferes with the CBP binding to transcription factor(s) involved in the cAMP stimulation of PEPCK-C gene transcription. This conclusion is further strengthened by the experiment shown in Fig.8 in which the effect of dnSREBP-1c on the inhibition of PEPCK-C gene transcription caused by E1A and NF1c was determined. E1A markedly inhibits both basal and PKA-stimulated transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter (25Leahy P. Crawford D.R. Grossman G. Chaudhry A. Gronostajski R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8813-8822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Kalvakalanu D.V.R. Liu J. Hanson R.W. Harter M.L. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2530-2536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that this effect on the PEPCK-C gene is exerted via the E1A binding domain (amino acids 1687–2241) on CBP that is required in the coordination of PEPCK-C gene transcription (25Leahy P.

Members of the NF1 family of transcription factors also totally block PKA-stimulated PEPCK-C gene transcription, but they act via the CREB binding domain (amino acids 451–682) in the PEPCK-C gene promoter (25Leahy P.

Cdk5 has an impact on actin polymerization during neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth and deregulation of the kinase has been implicated in the promotion of neurodegeneration. Recently it was shown that Cdk5 modulates dopamine signaling in neurons by regulating DARPP-32 function. In addition, Cdk5 phosphorylates munc-18 and synapsin I, two essential components of the exocytotic machinery. We have shown by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry, and Western blotting that Cdk5 is present in the insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cell. Subcellular fractionation of isolated β-cells revealed a glucose-induced translocation of membrane-bound Cdk5 protein to lower density fractions. Inhibition of Cdk5 with roscovitine reduced insulin secretion with ∼35% compared with control after glucose stimulation and with ∼65% after depolarization with glucose and KCl. Capacitance measurements performed on single β-cells that expressed a dominant-negative Cdk5 mutant showed impaired exocytosis. The effect on exocytosis by Cdk5 appeared to be independent of changes in free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. Taken together these results show that Cdk5 is present in β-cells and acts as a positive regulator of insulin exocytosis.

Exocytosis has been suggested to be mediated by the same core fusion machinery that traverses intracellular membrane traffic in all cells (1Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H.

It was reported that the membrane fusion event required the N -ethylmaleimidesensitive factor (NSF),1 andsoluble NSF AttachmentProteins, α-, β-, and γ-SNAP (1Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W.

Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2611) Google Scholar). In addition to NSF and SNAPs, a 7 S core complex with SNApreceptors or “SNARE” proteins corresponding to the vesicle component synaptobrevin/vesicular-associated membrane protein, as well as the plasma membrane proteins SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa) and syntaxin were necessary for neuronal exocytosis (3Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). The SNARE hypothesis proposes that the SNARE proteins form trans-complexes between adjacent membranes, thereby forcing them to proximity. After association of α-SNAP, the ATPase NSF completes the reaction by disassembling the SNARE complex leading to membrane bilayer mixing (3Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). More recently, trans-SNARE pairing and NSF activity has been suggested to act either prior to docking of vesicles or after membrane bilayer mixing (4Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W.

However, syntaxin, SNAP-25, synaptobrevin/vesicular-associated membrane protein, and other synaptic proteins regulating neuronal exocytosis have also been identified in pancreatic β-cells, suggesting that the mechanism for insulin secretion is similar to that of neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles in neurons (10Jacobsson G.

Regulated secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells has to be tightly controlled to ensure glucose homeostasis in the body. The capacity of the β-cell to respond to stimulation is determined by several different signaling pathways. One important feature of these pathways is the phosphorylation cascade of a wide range of cellular substrates. Many different kinases such as protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and protein-tyrosine kinases are present in the islets (14Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 429-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From neuronal systems it is known that protein phosphorylation of synaptic proteins plays significant roles in modulating different steps during exocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling (15Turner K.M. Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 459-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Presumably, protein kinases are also important players in the managing of secretory granules in the pancreatic β-cell. However, data regarding the physiological relevance for a particular kinase in the regulation of insulin secretion is often contradictory (reviewed in Ref. 14Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 429-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and their activator molecules (cyclins) are heterodimers known to be powerful regulators of cell division progression (16Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar, 17Lees E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 18Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar). Although Cdk5 is expressed in most mammalian tissues and interacts with the widespread D-type cyclins, this association apparently does not result in an active kinase (19Lee M.H. Nikolic M. Baptista C.A. Lai E. Tsai L.H. Massague J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3259-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,20Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). The recognition of Cdk5 activity in post-mitotic neurons in the central nervous system suggested functions unrelated to cell cycle control (reviewed in Ref. 21Lew J. Wang J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 33-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Neuronal Cdk5 activation was found to be mediated by complex formation with proteins exhibiting only limited homology to classical cyclins (22Ishiguro K. Kobayashi S. Omori A. Takamatsu M.

Nikolic M. de la M.S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that Cdk5 promotes neurite extension of cultured cortical neurons and other mechanisms associated with actin polymerization (31Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T.

Interestingly, it was also recently reported that Cdk5 modulates dopamine signaling by phosphorylating dopamine and adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) (40Bibb J.A.

In the present study we report that Cdk5 is expressed outside the nervous system in the insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cell and that this kinase positively affects insulin exocytosis. Expression constructs encoding wild-type (wt) and a dominant-negative (dn) form of Cdk5 were gifts of S. van den Heuvel (42van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). In the dn Cdk5 mutant an Asp is changed to an Asn at amino acid 144. This amino acid substitution results in a catalytic inactive kinase (24Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E.

Antibodies used were a rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdk5 antibody, C8 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a mouse monoclonal anti-insulin antibody, HB125 (Biogenex), a mouse monoclonal anti-syntaxin 1 antibody, HPC-1 (Sigma), and a mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody, DM 1A (Sigma). Secondary antibodies used for immunocytochemistry were Texas Red goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugate purchased from Molecular Probes and fluorescein anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugate purchased from Vector Laboratories. The secondary antibodies used in Western blotting were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Dako Corp.). Roscovitine was obtained from Calbiochem, diluted to a 10 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and used in a final concentration of 10 μm. Fura-2/acetoxymetyl ester (Fura-2/AM) was obtained from Molecular Probes and used in a final concentration of 2 μm. Mouse pancreatic β-cells were isolated from 10–12-month-old non-inbred obese hyperglycemic mice (gene ob/ob) as described previously (43Lernmark A. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar,44Nilsson T. Arkhammar P. Hallberg A. Hellman B. Berggren P.O. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Ob/ob islets are composed of more than 90% β-cells (44Nilsson T. Arkhammar P. Hallberg A. Hellman B. Berggren P.O. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 45Hellman B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1965; 131: 541-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded onto coverslips and cultured in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 11 mm glucose supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Total RNA was isolated from mouse brain (C57BL6) and pancreatic islets (ob/ob) using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Reverse transcribed-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using the SuperScriptTM RT-PCR System (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cdk5-specific primers were designed and synthesized (GenSet) according to data base sequences (5′-ACTGTGTTCAAGGCTAAAAACC-3′and 5′-CAATTTCAACTCCCCATTCC-3). The RT-PCR reactions were performed using 10 pmol of each primer and the following program: 30 min at 50 °C and 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, ending with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The amplified PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. 1-Kilobase DNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as size marker. Primary β-cells from ob/obmice were cultured 2–3 days as described above. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained as described previously (46Andersson J. Fried G. Lilja L. Meister B. Bark C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The stainings were analyzed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS NT), equipped with a krypton/argon laser. The images were processed with Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software. Pancreatic islets isolated from ob/ob mice and brain tissue from C57BL6 were homogenized in buffer containing (in mm): 20 HEPES, 2 EDTA, 1 MgCl2, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture according to instructions from the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Diagnostics), pH 7.4. Postnuclear supernatants were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min to separate soluble and membrane fractions. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) or Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Samples were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% blotto (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 0.025% Tween 20 (Merck Eurolab) for 1 h and then probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulins for 45 min at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after exposure to Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Isolated islets fromob/ob mice were incubated for 1 h in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 3 or 17 mm glucose and supplements as described above. The islets were washed three times in homogenization buffer containing (in mm): 20 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 250 d-sucrose, 2 EDTA, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 or 17 glucose as well as 5 μg/ml each of antipain, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, pH 7.4. Thereafter the islets were homogenized in 250 μl of homogenization buffer and shortly centrifuged to pellet nuclei. The supernatant was collected and the pellet was subjected to another homogenization and centrifugation as described above. The two supernatants were pooled and loaded onto a 4.4-ml linear sucrose density gradient (prepared from 0.6 and 2m sucrose stock solutions). The gradient was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 18 h in a Beckman L8–55 ultracentrifuge in a SW50 rotor and 15–16 fractions (300 μl each) were collected from the top of the gradient. The linearity of the gradients was examined by measuring the refractive index of each fraction. The fractions were frozen until analyzed by immunoblotting. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated with appropriate antibodies followed by ECL as described above. Chemiluminescence was detected by using a CCD camera (LAS 1000, Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.), that provides optimal linearity of signal intensity. The obtained signals were quantified using the Image Gauge 3.12 software (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). β-Cells isolated from ob/ob mice or lean mice were preincubated for 4 h in RPMI 1640 culture medium with additions as described above, and supplemented with 10 μm roscovitine, a potent inhibitor of Cdk5 activity (47Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar), or with an equal volume of Me2SO as control. Insulin release was studied in perifused β-cell aggregates mixed with Bio-Gel P-4 polyacrylamide beads (Bio-Rad), in a 0.5-ml column at 37 °C. The cells were perifused with 3 mm glucose for 20 min, followed by a 20-min exposure to 11 mm glucose, returned back to 3 mm glucose for 20 min, and finally co-stimulated with 11 mm glucose and 25 mm KCl for 20 min. Roscovitine and/or Me2SO were included in all solutions during the experiment. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min and 2-min fractions were collected. Insulin release was assayed by solid phase radioimmunoassay (RIA), using rat insulin as standard (Novo Nordisk). The basal level of insulin secretion was determined as the mean value from 10 data points of the first 20 min in 3 mm glucose. The area under the curve was examined by cutting out the curves, using the mean values, and weighing the obtained pieces on an analysis scale. Single mouse pancreatic β-cells from adult ob/ob mice were transfected with either wild-type (wt) pCMV-Cdk5 or dominant-negative (dn) pCMV-Cdk5 in combination with pIRES2-EGFP (CLONTECH), using the LipofectAMINE 2000 technique (Life Technologies, Inc.). For mock transfection, only pIRES2-EGFP was transfected. The transfected cells were cultured for 2–4 days on coverslips. The cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were selected for whole cell patch clamp capacitance measurements. Electrodes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries, fire-polished, and coated with Sylgard close to the tips. The electrode resistance ranged between 2 and 4 MΩ when the pipettes were filled with the intracellular solutions. The electrode offset potential was corrected in the bath prior to gigaseal formation. Conventional whole cell recordings were performed with an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier together with LockIn extension of PULSE software (HEKA Elektronik). A sinewave stimulus (500 Hz, 20 mV peak to peak) was superimposed onto a DC holding potential of −70 mV. The resulting currents were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. The capacitance traces were imported to IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Inc.). The data were analyzed with a PC using IGOR Pro. The standard extracellular solution consisted of (in mm): 138 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.6 CaCl2, 3 d-glucose, and 5 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). The electrode solution was composed of (in mm): 110 potassium glutamate, 10 KCl, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 7 CaCl2, 0.5 Mg-ATP, 0.1 cAMP, and 5 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.15 with KOH). The free Ca2+concentration in the electrode solution was estimated to 0.34 μm according to the binding constants of Ca2+to EGTA and ATP in the presence of Mg2+ at pH 7.15 (48Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Vol. 1, Amino Acids, and Vol. 2, Amines. Plenum Press, New York1971Google Scholar). Cells were perfused continuously with the extracellular solution, at a flow rate of 2 ml/min during the course of an experiment. The temperature of the extracellular solution was 32 °C when measured in the position of recording electrodes. Cell aggregates attached to coverslips were loaded with 2 μmof the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2/AM at 37 °C for 45 min in a basal buffer containing (in mm): 125 NaCl, 5.9 KCl, 1.28 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 25 HEPES, 3 glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Coverslips were then mounted as the bottom of an open chamber placed on the stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Axiovert 35M). The stage of the microscope was thermostatically controlled to maintain a mean temperature of 37 ± 1 °C in the chamber. The microscope was connected to a SPEX fluorolog-2 CM1T11I system for dual wavelength excitation fluorimetry. Various treatments during recordings were done using a perifusion system attached to the chamber (see below for the different treatments). The excitation wavelengths generated by two monochromators were directed to the cells by a dichroic mirror. The emitted light, selected by a 500–530-nm band pass filter, was directed to a CCD imaging system. The emissions at the two excitation wavelengths of 340 nm (F340) and 380 nm (F380) were used to calculate the fluorescence ratio (F340/F380), yielding relative changes in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i . Cells were pretreated with 10 μm roscovitine or Me2SO for 3.5–5 h, loaded with fura-2/AM for 45 min, and stimulated with 25 mm KCl for 2 min. Following these experiments, the cells were stimulated with glucose to verify that the recorded cells were glucose responsive β-cells. Cells from each group were averaged for each time point and a composite recording was plotted. Rate of initial response, peak delta ratio, and area under curve were analyzed. To examine if transcription of Cdk5 mRNA occurred in pancreatic islets we performed RT-PCR using Cdk5-specific primers. RNA isolated from brain served as a positive control. A fragment of identical size was amplified from islet and brain RNA. The length of the fragment was consistent with the expected length of about 380 base pairs, estimated from the nucleotide sequence (Fig.1 A). To investigate if the Cdk5 protein was expressed in pancreatic β-cells, β-cells and brain tissue were homogenized and ultracentrifuged to receive a soluble and a membrane fraction. Cdk5 immunoreactivity was detected in β-cell homogenate, both in soluble and membrane fractions. However, Cdk5 was enriched in the soluble fraction. The distribution of membrane-bound and soluble Cdk5 protein in β-cells was similar to the distribution of Cdk5 protein in brain homogenate (Fig. 1 B). To further confirm the presence and subcellular localization of Cdk5 protein in single β-cells we performed immunocytochemistry. Cdk5 exhibited a granular staining pattern, homogeneously spread in the cytoplasm. Double staining with insulin proved that Cdk5 was expressed in the β-cells and partially co-distributed with this hormone (Fig.1 C). These results clearly show that Cdk5 mRNA and protein are expressed in insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells. A specialized feature of pancreatic β-cells is their responsiveness to glucose. To analyze if glucose stimulation of pancreatic β-cells changes the subcellular distribution of Cdk5 we performed sucrose density gradients on unstimulated and glucose-stimulated β-cells. The fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. In unstimulated β-cells Cdk5 immunoreactivity was mainly detected in low density fractions (fraction 2–5) corresponding to cytosolic fractions, but also in middle density fractions (fraction 6–10), resembling membrane-bound proteins (Fig.2 A, top, andC). The soluble protein α-tubulin served as a marker for cytosol (Fig. 2 A, middle) and syntaxin 1 was used as a plasma membrane marker (Fig. 2 A, bottom). In glucose-stimulated β-cells, Cdk5 immunoreactivity was still mainly detected in fractions 2–5, corresponding to the cytosol, but Cdk5 immunoreactivity in the plasma membrane fractions was notably diminished (Fig. 2, B, top, and C). The distribution of α-tubulin and syntaxin 1 immunoreactivity were approximately the same in glucose-stimulated β-cells (Fig.2 B, middle and bottom) and unstimulated β-cells (Fig. 2 A, middle andbottom). Fig. 2 C demonstrates a quantification of Cdk5 immunoreactivity in gradients presented as percentage of maximal signal. The sucrose density and protein concentration distribution of the gradients are shown in Fig. 2 D. These data show that glucose stimulation of pancreatic β-cells changed the subcellular localization of a population of Cdk5 protein, possibly by translocation of membrane bound Cdk5 to a soluble pool. To investigate if Cdk5 was involved in the regulation of insulin secretion, β-cells were pretreated with roscovitine for 4 h, a potent inhibitor of Cdk5 activity, or incubated with Me2SO as control. Insulin release was measured after perifusing the cells with 3 mmglucose, 11 mm glucose, and 11 mm glucose in combination with 25 mm KCl. The experiments were performed on cells isolated from ob/ob mice (Fig.3 A) and lean mice (Fig.3 B). Treatment with roscovitine decreased glucose-induced insulin secretion, both in cells from ob/ob and from lean mice compared with controls. After depolarization with KCl the reduction in insulin secretion was more pronounced. Roscovitine treatment of ob/ob cells reduced glucose-induced insulin release by ∼35% and insulin secretion induced by co-stimulation with glucose and KCl by ∼65% (Fig. 3 A). In cells isolated from lean mice the corresponding numbers were ∼50% (glucose) and ∼65% (glucose + KCl) (Fig. 3 B). The numbers were obtained by measuring the area under the curve for insulin secretion in control and roscovitine-treated cells. These data showed that roscovitine treatment prominently impaired insulin secretion from"

The sequence of the mature protein, deduced from a full-length cDNA, displays 22% identity to the serine-type protease IV (SppA) from Escherichia coli and 27% identity to Synechocystis SppA1 (sll1703) but lacks the putative transmembrane spanning segments predicted from the E. coli sequence.

The chloroplast localization of SppA was confirmed by in organello import experiments using an in vitro expression system and by immunodetection with antigen-specific antisera. Subfractionation of intact chloroplasts demonstrated that SppA is associated exclusively with thylakoid membranes, predominantly stroma lamellae, and is a part of some high molecular mass complex of about 270 kDa that exhibits proteolytic activity. Treatments with chaotropic salts and proteases showed that SppA is largely exposed to the stroma but that it behaves as an intrinsic membrane protein that may have an unusual monotopic arrangement in the thylakoids. We demonstrate that SppA is a light-inducible protease and discuss its possible involvement in the light-dependent degradation of antenna and photosystem II complexes that both involve serine-type proteases.

However, the actual number of chloroplast-located proteases appears to be much higher as judged from the biochemical purification of numerous chloroplast proteolytic activities in chloroplast subfractions (15Sokolenko A. Lerbs-Mache S. Altschmied L. Herrmann R.G. Plant Physiol. 1998; 115: 827-832Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and from the genome analysis of one chloroplast progenic ancestor, theSynechocystis genome, which displays about 40 different protease sequences. Biochemical studies have provided information about substrate and inhibitor specificity for some proteolytic activities (6Sokolenko A. Altschmied L. Herrmann R.G. Planta. 1997; 207: 286-295Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but a detailed knowledge of proteolytic processes requires that the enzymes themselves and the corresponding genes are characterized at the molecular level. Two kinds of proteases can be operationally distinguished from a physiological point of view: constitutive proteases that, for instance, are involved in the degradation of abnormal or damaged proteins and inducible proteases that are produced or activated only under conditions where specific degradation processes are required. The latter include enzymes that are induced by high light regimes or under heat shock. Well known representatives of that category from plants and bacteria are the heat shock protease Lon (16Charette M. Henderson G.W. Morkovitz S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In chloroplasts, several light-dependent degradation processes point to the possible existence of light-regulated proteases. For instance, the accumulation of early light-inducible proteins, a class of proteins that are induced at early stages of illumination, has been suggested to be controlled by a light-repressed protease (25Adamska I. Kloppstech K. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5438-5444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Adamska I. Lindahl M. Roobol-Boza M. Andersson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Conversely, degradation of LHCII,1 the major peripheral antenna protein of thylakoid membranes, is induced under high light and probably involves extrinsic (27Lindahl M. Yang D.-H. Andersson B. Eur.

We describe here a new chloroplast-located protease encoded by a nuclear gene in Arabidopsis that fulfills the requirements for participating in light-induced degradation processes in the organelle. This protease displays significant homology to prokaryotic SppA proteases. Arabidopsis and spinach seedlings were grown for 3–4 weeks in a greenhouse at 25 °C under a 12-h light period with a moderate light regime (150 μE m−2s−1). To monitor the effect of light on RNA or protein levels, the plants were transferred to darkness or high intensity light (700 μE m−2 s−1) for periods of 0–52 h. Plants exposed to different light regimes were harvested and used for preparation of total cellular RNA and protein fractions. For heat shock treatment plants were transferred from 25 °C to 42 °C for 30 min and harvested immediately. The Arabidopsis expressed sequence E8A10T7 (accession number AA042706), which displayed homology to prokaryotic SppA proteases, was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Ohio State University). A full-length SppA cDNA was isolated from an Arabidopsis cDNA library (33Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldmann K.A. Ecker J.R.

Thylakoid proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. SppA protease was separated from β-dodecyl-maltoside-solubilized thylakoid membrane fractions (0.2 mg of chlorophyll/run) by size exclusion chromatography on Superose 6 columns (3.2 × 30 cm; Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm KCl and 0.06% β-dodecyl-maltoside.

After electrophoresis the gels were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, to activate proteases and then stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250, 40% ethanol, 10% acetic acid for 30 min followed by destaining in 40% ethanol, 10% acetic acid. The protease activity became visible as a white zone in a Coomassie Blue-stained background. The library of BACs used was constructed at the Institut für Genbiologische Forschung Berlin GmbH (Instit für Genbiologische Forschung; Ref. 44Mozo T. Fischer S. Meier-Ewert S. Lehrach H. Altmann T. Plant J. 1998; 16: 377-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Individual recombinant BACs of this library are currently being ordered into contigs that at present represent more than 90% of the Arabidopsis genome. Additionally, representative DNA probes with known map positions were hybridized to BAC clones anchoring the available contigs on the genetic map of molecular markers. Taking advantage of these data (www.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/101/igf_bac_cont.html), sppA was mapped by hybridization to library filters of 9216 BAC clones spotted in duplicate in 3 × 3 arrays. The filters were obtained from the Resorcezentrum im Deutschen Humangenomprojekt, (Berlin, Germany; www.rzpd.de) and hybridized according to Legen et al.(45Legen J. Miséra S. Herrmann R.G. Meurer J. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A search of theArabidopsis data base revealed a DNA sequence exhibiting homology to the prokaryotic protease SppA. An expressed sequence tag (E8A10T7, accession number AA042706) of 835 base pairs was used as a probe for isolating the full-length cDNA by screening of an appropriate A. thaliana cDNA library. Five positive clones were selected. The recombinant DNA with the largest insert, 2196 base pairs (accession number AF114385), was sequenced.

It contained a single open reading frame of 2068 nucleotides, which corresponds to a polypeptide of 680 amino acid residues (Fig. 1) and a calculated molecular mass of 74.8 kDa. The coding region is preceded by a 28-base pair 5′-untranslated region and is trailed by an untranslated stretch of 119 base pairs. The N-terminal 68-residue domain of the protein displays typical features of a chloroplast stroma-targeting transit peptide (47Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R. Eur. J.

PSORT and ChloroP programs predicted two potential cleavage sites following Ala residues at positions 60 and 69, respectively (see arrowheads in Fig.1). Southern analysis of total Arabidopsis genomic DNA as well as a search through the A. thaliana Data Base (Stanford, CA) provided no evidence for a second sppA gene in theArabidopsis genome. High density filters of BAC contigs covering almost the entire Arabidopsis genome (44Mozo T. Fischer S. Meier-Ewert S. Lehrach H. Altmann T. Plant J. 1998; 16: 377-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to substantiate the gene copy number and to determine the chromosomal localization of sppA. A signal consistent with a single gene copy was found on a single BAC (number F2P9) originating in chromosome I (data not shown). The recent sequencing of the Arabidopsisgenome (internet information at mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/) confirmed the presence of a single sppA gene on that chromosome (accession number AC016662). To evaluate the chloroplast location of SppA, we conducted in organello import experiments with radiolabeled precursor protein made in vitro from the SppA cDNA. The sample displayed various premature termination products together with the precursor form of SppA, labeled p in Fig.2 (lane TP). The radiolabeled SppA precursor protein was successfully imported into intact chloroplasts from spinach and processed to the mature form (labeledm in Fig. 2). The imported mature SppA was resistant to proteolytic attack upon incubation of intact spinach chloroplasts with thermolysin or trypsin for 30 min (experiment not shown). Subfractionation of the organelles into thylakoid (Fig. 2, lane Th) and soluble stroma fractions (Fig. 2, lane S) showed that the radiolabeled SppA mature protein was recovered exclusively in the thylakoid fraction (Fig. 2, lane Th). The thylakoid location of SppA within the organelle was confirmed by a serological approach with stromal, thylakoid membrane and lumenal proteins prepared from intact Arabidopsis chloroplasts using an antiserum elicited against the C-terminal part of the protein (amino acid residues 493–680; Fig.3 A). SppA could be detected as a 68-kDa polypeptide that was exclusively associated with thylakoid membranes (Fig. 3 A).Figure 3Localization of SppA protease within chloroplasts. A, intact chloroplasts were isolated fromArabidopsis plants and fractionated into stroma (S), thylakoid membranes (TM), and lumenal (L) proteins. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunodecorated with an antiserum against the C-terminal part of SppA. B, thylakoids were partially lysed by digitonin and fractions enriched in grana (G), grana margins (M), and stroma lamellae (S) were separated by differential centrifugation. Antisera against SppA and the 33-kDa subunit of oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II (control) were used for immunodetection in fractionated thylakoid membranes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further fragmented thylakoid membranes by digitonin treatment and subsequent differential centrifugation. This treatment allowed separate fractions enriched in grana membranes, grana margins, and stroma lamellae (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). As illustrated by Fig. 3 B, the immunodetection of the 33-kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving system of photosystem II showed a preferential location in the grana membranes and grana margins (lanes G and M in Fig. 3 B) in agreement with the well known distribution of that photosystem in the thylakoid system (50Andersson B. Anderson J.M.,. Bot. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 593: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In contrast, SppA was highly enriched in stroma lamellae. Its presence in the grana fraction can be probably attributed to a cross-contamination inherent in the available procedures. To estimate the nature of the association of SppA with the stroma lamellae, purified thylakoids were treated with solutions of chaotropic salts (NaBr and NaSCN) or with alkaline solutions (Na2CO3 and NaOH). The protein was partially released from the membranes only after treatment with the strong chaotropic reagent NaSCN (Fig. 4). That the membrane association of SppA resisted alkaline treatments as well as NaBr treatment suggests that SppA behaves rather as an integral than as a peripheral membrane protein. The topology of SppA within thylakoid membranes was further investigated by protease protection assays. Freshly prepared intact thylakoids or thylakoids permeabilized by sonication were treated with thermolysin, trypsin, or proteinase K (Fig.5). As a control experiment, we first assayed the thylakoid samples with an antibody against the 33-kDa protein of the oxygen-evolving system that is peripherally located at the lumenal face of thylakoid membranes (51Yamamoto Y. Doi M. Tamura N. Nishimura M. FEBS Lett. 1981; 133: 265-268Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In intact thylakoids (Fig. 5, left bottom panel), the 33-kDa protein remained fully protected against proteolytic attack, even using the harshest treatment with proteinase K. Upon thylakoid sonication, the 33-kDa protein became mildly sensitive to thermolysin and produced a degradation product of low molecular mass seen at the gel bottom. It was fully degraded by trypsin and proteinase K under the same conditions. Thus, the externally added proteases got full access to the lumenal membrane surface only upon sonication of the thylakoids. In intact thylakoids, SppA was partially digested by thermolysin or trypsin, and it was extensively digested by proteinase K (Fig. 5,left upper panel). Thus, SppA was readily accessible from the stromal surface to externally added proteases. Sonicated thylakoids that were also accessible to proteases from the lumenal surface displayed the same SppA proteolytic patterns as those observed with intact thylakoids. Thus, we conclude that SppA is exposed at the stromal face of thylakoids and that it has no notable protease-sensitive domains exposed to the thylakoid lumen. To study the proteolytic activity of SppA we first attempted to overexpress precursor and mature forms of the protein in E. coli. Overexpression of the precursor form proved unsuccessful, whereas that of the mature form, starting from Phe60, resulted in low yield production of two truncated products (data not shown). These results suggest that the heterologous expression of chloroplast SppA was detrimental to the bacteria most likely by virtue of its homology to the bacterial SppA protease (59Ichihara S. Suzuki T. Suzuki M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9405-9411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the proteolytic activity of SppA was further analyzed by gel exclusion chromatography after mild solubilization of the major protein complexes from the thylakoid membranes. SppA was part of a high molecular mass complex of ∼270 kDa that eluted in fractions 15–17 marked in Fig.6 A, consistent with the homotetrameric structure of SppA from E. coli (59Ichihara S. Suzuki T. Suzuki M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9405-9411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions collected from size exclusion chromatography were analyzed both for the presence of SppA by immunodetection (Fig. 6 B) and for proteolytic activity (Fig. 6 C). The SppA-containing fractions, when run on nondenaturing gels containing gelatin, showed high proteolytic activity as visualized by the white band on a dark background (Fig. 6 C). The apparent molecular mass deduced from the electrophoretic migration of this proteolytically active band, ∼270 kDa, corresponded well with that of the complex eluted by size exclusion chromatography. Similar data were obtained by sucrose gradient centrifugation of thylakoid lysates according to Ref. 41Müller B. Eichacker L.A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2365-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar (data not shown). The proteolytic activity of SppA was significantly inhibited by the specific antiserum (∼90%; no suppression occurred with preimmune serum), by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride but not iodoacetamide consistent with a serine-type protease (data not shown). RNA filter hybridization was employed to investigate the expression of SppA at the transcript level (Fig. 7). WhenArabidopsis plants were grown under moderate light (150 mE m−2 s−1), they displayed no detectable SppA transcript (Fig. 7, lane 0). However, the more sensitive combined the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique on a Light Cycler machine (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) allowed to detect minute amounts of the transcripts (data not shown). SppA transcripts remained below detection using conventional Northern procedures in plants after heat shock treatment (data not shown). However, when Arabidopsis plants were transferred to higher light intensities (e.g. 700 μE m−2s−1), a 2.2-kilobase pair SppA transcript became detectable after 10 h of exposure. The stationary mRNA concentrations increased about five times during the next 40 h under high light (Fig. 7, lanes 10–52 h). This light-induced transcription was accompanied by a substantial increase in the steady-state levels of the corresponding protein (Fig.8). In this experimentArabidopsis plants grown under moderate light for 6 days were either kept under the same light regime or transferred to darkness or to higher light intensities for 52 h.

Here we have investigated the direct effect of insulin on macrophages, which are known to be important in the atherosclerotic process. We treated THP-1 macrophages with insulin (10−7m) and examined the gene expression using nucleic acid array systems. The results of array analysis showed that insulin stimulated gene expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) the most among all genes in the analysis. In addition, insulin administration to macrophages enhanced both mRNA expression and protein secretion of TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner. To determine the signaling pathway involved in this TNF-α response to insulin, we pretreated the cells with three distinct protein kinase inhibitors: wortmannin, PD98059, and SB203580. Only PD98059, which inhibits extracellular signal-regulated kinases, suppressed insulin-induced production of TNF-α mRNA and protein in THP-1 macrophages. These observations indicate that insulin stimulates TNF-α production in macrophages by regulating the expression of TNF-α mRNA and that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway may have a critical role in stimulating the production of TNF-α in response to insulin in macrophages.

In addition, macrophages play a significant role in the process of atherosclerosis: they take up and degrade modified low density lipoprotein via scavenger receptors (4Steinberg D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 598: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 5Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20963-20966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar), developing into macrophage foam cells; and they secrete various cytokines such as TNF-α1 and interleukin 1. In fact, macrophages and/or macrophage foam cells are frequently found in atherosclerotic lesions, and microscopy shows that early lesions of atherosclerosis are characterized by the infiltration of monocyte macrophages, the proliferation of medial smooth muscle cells, and the presence of macrophage foam cells (6Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9989) Google Scholar). Diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor in all manifestations of atherosclerotic vascular disease; however, the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients has not yet been elucidated. Several prospective studies in nondiabetic and diabetic patients have shown that there is an association between hyperinsulinemia resulting from insulin resistance and developed atherosclerotic disorders such as cardiovascular diseases (7Jarrett R.J. McCartney P. Keen H. Diabetologia. 1982; 22: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 8Pyorala K. Laakso M. Unsitupa M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1987; 3: 463-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). In addition, evidence has accumulated that insulin has actions that may be related to the development of atherosclerosis (9Reaven G.M. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1595-1607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kaplan N.M. Arch. Intern. Med. 1989; 149: 1514-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zavaroni I. Bonora E. Pagliara M. Dall'Aglio E.

The insulin-resistant state that occurs in hyperinsulinemia often clusters with other risk factors, including hypertension, glucose tolerance, and hypertriglyceridemia, that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, presumably due to promotion of atherosclerosis (9Reaven G.M. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1595-1607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kaplan N.M. Arch. Intern. Med. 1989; 149: 1514-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zavaroni I. Bonora E. Pagliara M. Dall'Aglio E.

Several studies have demonstrated that exogenous insulin accelerates the development of atherosclerosis (12Stout R.W. Br. Med. J. 1970; 19: 685-687Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Sato Y. Shiraishi S. Oshida Y. Ishiguro T. Sakamoto N. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 91-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, insulin action has been widely investigated in cells and tissues that construct arterial walls, such as arterial endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. For example, it has been suggested that insulin acts as a growth factor for vascular smooth muscle cells (14Stout R.W. Bierman E.L. Ross R. Circ. Res. 1975; 36: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 15Pfeifle B. Ditschuneit H. Diabetologia. 1981; 20: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, the action of insulin on macrophages involved in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis has been poorly studied. Here, to examine the direct effect of insulin on macrophages, we have investigated the expression of genes induced by insulin using a membrane array technique. The results show that insulin is able to up-regulate the expression of genes, including the TNF-α gene, in macrophages derived from the cloned cell line THP-1. Our study demonstrates that insulin can also increase the release of TNF-α protein from THP-1-derived and human monocyte-derived macrophages after an increase in TNF-α mRNA and that this effect involves the insulin-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. RPMI 1640 medium, human insulin, phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and wortmannin were purchased from Sigma. Insulin was dissolved in sterile water acidified (pH 2.0) with a small volume of HCl to make a 10−3m stock solution. The polyclonal antibody against TNF-α was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). PD98059 and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem. The human THP-1 monocytic leukemia cell line was purchased from Dainippon Pharmaceuticals (Tokyo, Japan). THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. We differentiated the THP-1 cells by resuspending them for 2 days in medium containing phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (40 ng/ml), which had been prepared as a 104 times concentrated stock solution in Me2SO. Such treatment with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate induces the conversion of THP-1 into mature cells that function as macrophages (16Tsuchiya S. Yamabe M. Yamaguchi Y. Kobayashi Y. Konno T. Tada K. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 26: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 17Tsuchiya S. Kobayashi Y. Goto Y. Okumura H. Nakae S. Konno T. Tada K. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1530-1536PubMed Google Scholar). We used these mature cells, designated “THP-1-derived macrophages,” in all experiments. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from three healthy volunteers by density centrifugation using LymphoprepTM (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway). The collected mononuclear cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% autologous serum for 7 days for differentiation into macrophages. These cells were always pretreated with media lacking fetal bovine serum and phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate for at least 8 h before insulin stimulation to remove the effects of these reagents. The nylon membrane on which a large number of different human cDNA probes were spotted was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). THP-1 macrophages were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice and then incubated in RPMI 1640 medium or in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10−7m insulin. After 6 h, total RNA was prepared from cells by using the acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method and treated with DNase I (100 units/mg RNA) to avoid contamination with genomic DNA. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using biotinylated oligo(dT) and streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Promega, Madison, WI). We synthesized 32P-labeled cDNA probes from total poly(A)+ RNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase using a random hexamer and hybridized the synthetic probes at 68 °C for 12 h to membranes on which the indicated cDNA had been spotted. After hybridization, the membrane was washed with 2× SSC + 1% SDS, and the autoradiographs were quantified by densitometry with the BAS2000 Bioimaging Analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Macrophages in 6-cm-diameter dishes were stimulated with or without insulin for the indicated times. In some experiments, cells were stimulated with insulin in the presence of other reagents, as indicated. Total RNA was prepared from the cells using a commercial kit (RNeasyTM; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and 10 or 15 µg of RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane for Northern blot hybridization. In some experiments, we prepared poly(A)+ RNA as described above and used 1 µg for electrophoresis. To construct the probes for human TNF-α for hybridization, we carried out reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on RNA that had been extracted from THP-1 macrophages using the primers 5′-CTTCTCCTTCCTGATCGTGG-3′ and 5′-GCTGGTTATCTCTCAGCTCCA-3′, which were designed on the basis of the TNF-α sequence reported in GenBankTM (accession number X01394). The 266-base pair amplified fragments were analyzed by the dideoxy chain termination method and labeled to generate the 32P-labeled probes used for Northern blot hybridization. After Northern blot hybridization, the membrane was washed in 2× SSC + 1% SDS at 58 °C for 30 min. The autoradiographs were quantified by densitometry with the BAS2000 Bioimaging Analyzer (Fuji Film). Each densitometric result of mRNA was normalized to the densitometric result of 28 S rRNA or elongation factor-1α mRNA in the same sample. The differentiated THP-1 macrophages were stimulated with insulin for the indicated times, and the cells were lysed by phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and some protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin). The solubilized proteins were centrifuged, and the supernatants were used for protein analysis. Protein concentration was determined with a modified procedure of the Lowry assay (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and equal volumes of proteins were separated by 13.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was treated with primary antibody specific to human TNF-α. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the signals were detected using the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Backinghamshire, UK). Macrophages seeded into 24-well culture plates (5 × 105 cells/well) were stimulated with insulin for 24 and 48 h. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with other chemicals as indicated for 1 h. TNF-α release in medium was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a commercial kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), following the manufacturer's protocols. In each well, residual cells that had been deprived of medium were lysed with 0.1 nNaOH, and cellular protein was measured with a modified procedure of the Lowry assay. The TNF-α content in the medium was normalized to cell protein values. THP-1 macrophages were lysed with cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmorthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were centrifuged for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected for measurement. ERK enzyme activity was determined using a commercial kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as follows. Briefly, the supernatants were mixed with the synthetic substrate peptide, and then a solution of magnesium and [32P]ATP was added. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated with buffer containing orthophosphoric acid, and samples of each of the reaction solutions were spotted onto paper disks. The paper disks were washed to remove any nonspecifically bound [32P]ATP, and ERK activity was determined by measuring the radioactivity of phosphorylated peptide bound to the paper disks using a scintillation counter. All experiments were repeated at least twice, and similar results were observed in each experiment. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Group data are compared using Student's t test. p < 0.05 is considered to be statistically significant. We investigated the effect of insulin action on macrophages. First, using membrane array systems, we examined the effect of insulin on gene expression in THP-1-derived macrophages. In TableI, we show a sample selection of 25 genes (the names or the GenBankTM accession number of representative genes including TNF-α are shown in Table I) that had values of radioactivity in the highest range and 6 housekeeping genes. To calculate the fold induction, we divided the radioactivity detected from stimulated cells by that from unstimulated cells. The results showed that 6 h of insulin stimulation in macrophages up-regulated mRNA levels of TNF-α. The average fold induction of the housekeeping genes was 1.036 ± 0.203, whereas that of TNF-α was much higher (2.452). The increase in TNF-α expression was also higher as compared with the average fold induction of the other sample genes, which was 1.186 ± 0.366.Table IEffect of insulin on mRNA expression in THP-1-derived macrophagesGene (GenBank accession no.)RadioactivityFold inductionAverage (mean ± SD)Insulin (−)Insulin (+)Tumor necrosis factor α550.611350.502.452(X08058;M24485)3477.254500.671.294(J03746;B28083)1019.601274.621.250(J04111)532.88801.1471.503(M11717)483.45500.941.036(M62397)396.64578.201.457(L19067)241.88262.941.087(M32315;M55994)200.35180.490.900(X15722)197.55179.170.906(L36719)193.85173.230.893(K00065)172.90179.651.039(L22474)135.20165.211.222(Y00483)129.42130.871.011(M34664)103.5787.230.842(M25627)94.9183.760.882(L08096)81.3874.180.9111.186 ±0.366(X12794)49.2454.501.106(U78876)43.5251.121.174(L41690)39.5059.841.515(L20121;L20122)36.9081.162.199(L33264)34.4114.110.410(X59798;M64349)27.6845.871.657(L27211)18.2522.521.234(U18321;X83544)9.7011.461.181(X89986;U34584)7.4612.981.740Housekeeping genesUbiquitin12779.6213698.671.071Phospholipase A2260.81212.450.8141.036 ± 0.203GAPDH8980.5410818.181.204β-Actin298.34241.890.81060S ribosomal protein9028.717914.050.87640S ribosomal protein1558.791941.421.245THP-1-derived macrophages were cultured in media in the absence (−) or presence (+) of insulin (10−7m) for 6 h.

The radioactivity of each gene was measured using an imaging analyzer, and the fold induction was calculated. For each group, the mean ± SD is also shown. Gene names are identified as the GenBank™ accession numbers, except for TNF-α and housekeeping genes. We then carried out Northern blotting to confirm the effect of insulin on TNF-α mRNA expression that we had observed in THP-1 macrophages by using the membrane array technique. Treatment with insulin resulted in significant increases in TNF-α mRNA in THP-1-derived macrophages (Fig.1a). After incubating the macrophages with 10−7m insulin for 6 h, the level of TNF-α mRNA increased about 1.5-fold when analyzing total RNA (Fig. 1 a) and 1.6-fold when analyzing poly(A)+ RNA (Fig. 1, b and c) as compared with cells incubated in the absence of insulin. Similar results were observed after 24 h of insulin incubation. This stimulatory effect of insulin was dose-dependent in a range between 10−9 and 10−7m (Fig. 1,b and c). Next, we examined the effect of insulin on the biosynthesis of TNF-α protein in macrophages by Western blotting analysis of a whole-cell lysate. After 24 h of insulin treatment, the amount of TNF-α was increased in whole cells (Fig. 2). These results confirmed that insulin stimulated the transcription of TNF-α in THP-1 macrophages and that the increase in TNF-α protein observed in cells was comparable with the increase observed in mRNA. Inflammatory chemicals such as interferon-γ and LPS are shown to increase the secretion of TNF-α (19Sakurai A. Satomi N. Haranaka K. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1985; 20: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Gifford G.E. Lohmann Matthes M.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1986; 38: 135-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We therefore measured TNF-α protein mass in the cell medium by ELISA to determine the effect of insulin on TNF-α secretion. Treatment of THP-1-derived macrophages with insulin for 24 h resulted in an increase of TNF-α secretion (Fig. 3). To determine whether the concentration of insulin used for incubation affects the amount of TNF-α secreted, we incubated THP-1 macrophages in increasing concentrations of insulin for 24 h. Insulin up-regulated the secretion of TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 a). Up-regulation of TNF-α secretion was also observed after incubating the macrophages for 48 h with a concentration of 10−7m insulin (Fig.3 b). Similar effects of insulin were observed in human monocyte-derived macrophages (Fig.4) and also in the presence of LPS (data not shown).Figure 4Induction of TNF-α mRNA and release by insulin in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Human monocyte-derived macrophages were stimulated with insulin at the indicated concentrations for 24 h, and then TNF-α protein content in the supernatant was measured by ELISA. The amount of TNF-α was normalized to the value of total cell protein (n = 4). ∗, p < 0.05versus control; ∗∗, p < 0.01versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When cells are stimulated with insulin, two distinct signaling pathways are activated via the insulin receptor: the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and the Raf/ERK pathway. We investigated the involvement of these pathways in insulin-stimulated TNF-α mRNA expression and protein production using a specific inhibitor of each pathway. The increase in TNF-α mRNA expression induced by insulin in THP-1-derived macrophages was markedly inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with PD98059, which is a specific inhibitor of ERK-1 and ERK-2, at a concentration of 25 µm (Fig.5). This concentration has been reported to be sufficient to inhibit more than 90% of ERK activity (21Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). In contrast, pretreatment of the macrophages with 100 nmwortmannin, which is a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, or with 25 µm SB203580, which is a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, had no significant effect on the insulin stimulation of TNF-α gene expression (Fig. 5). Next, we examined the effect of these inhibitors on the insulin-induced increase in TNF-α protein release. As with the gene expression results, the measurement of TNF-α protein mass in the cell medium showed that the ERK inhibitor markedly suppressed TNF-α secretion from insulin-stimulated THP-1 macrophages. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of PD98059 was so potent that the production of TNF-α in cells treated with PD98059 was not only less than that in cells treated with insulin but was also less than that in the untreated control cells. This inhibitory effect of PD98059 was not due to a general toxic effect because the total protein production was not reduced by treatment with this compound (data not shown). The p38 MAPK inhibitor also suppressed TNF-α secretion, but the effect was much weaker than that of the ERK inhibitor, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor had no effect on the insulin stimulation of TNF-α secretion (Fig. 6a). This inhibitory effect of PD98059 on TNF-α secretion was also observed in human monocyte/macrophages (data not shown). We also compared the effect of the two inhibitors PD98059 and SB203580 on TNF-α secretion in macrophages in the presence and absence of insulin stimulation. Fig.6 b shows that insulin can still increase TNF-α secretion in THP-1 macrophages in the presence of SB203580, but not in the presence of PD98059. Our findings indicated that the Raf/ERK pathway and its activation are required for insulin-induced production of TNF-α in THP-1 macrophages; therefore, we next tried to determine whether insulin treatment leads to the direct activation of ERKs in THP-1 macrophages and whether PD98059 can inhibit this activation. We therefore determined ERK activity by measuring the radioactivity of substrates phosphorylated with 32P. Treatment of macrophages with 10−7m insulin induced the activation of ERKs within the first 5 min of incubation; this activation increased until 15 min and decreased gradually thereafter until 30 min. However, this insulin-induced activation was completely blocked by PD98059. ERK activity decreased sharply within the first 5 min of co-incubation with insulin and PD98059 and continued to decline throughout the duration of the experiment. At 30 min, PD98059 treatment had reduced the ERK activity to 57% of the pretreatment levels, despite the presence of insulin (Fig. 7). Current studies demonstrate novel effects of insulin action on the gene expression and protein production of TNF-α in macrophages differentiated from human monocyte or monocytic THP-1 cells, which have been shown to be differentiated into mature cells with macrophage functions by treatment with reagents such as phorbol ester (17Tsuchiya S. Kobayashi Y. Goto Y. Okumura H. Nakae S. Konno T. Tada K. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1530-1536PubMed Google Scholar, 22Schwende H. Fitzke E. Ambs P. Dieter P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). There have not been many reports on the influence of insulin on gene expression in cultured macrophages, but using a membrane array system, we observed the induction of some genes as shown in Table I, including TNF-α, in THP-1 macrophages after incubation with insulin. We also confirmed that the expression of TNF-α mRNA was up-regulated by insulin treatment using Northern blot analysis. TNF-α is a potent inflammatory mediator secreted from macrophages, and it is important in many macrophage-associated reactions such as immune and inflammation processes (1Kelley J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 141: 765-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 2Bonta I.L. Ben Efraim S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 3Belardelli F. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 103: 161-179Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Some inflammatory mediators such as bacterial LPS or interferon-γ have also been reported to mediate TNF-α release from primary macrophages and macrophage cell lines (19Sakurai A. Satomi N. Haranaka K. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1985; 20: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Gifford G.E. Lohmann Matthes M.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1986; 38: 135-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In particular, LPS, which is a powerful inducer of TNF-α release in macrophages, has been reported to increase TNF-α production by regulating mRNA expression directly in macrophages (23Remick D.G. Scales W.E. May M.A. Spengler M. Nguyen D. Kunkel S.L. Lab. Invest. 1988; 59: 809-816PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore expected that the insulin-stimulated increase in TNF-α mRNA in macrophages would lead to a corresponding increase in production and release of TNF-α protein, as we have shown in this study. Furthermore, we have investigated the effect of insulin on TNF-α production in other types of cells (3T3-L1 adipocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in which TNF-α is synthesized); however, we could not find any significant increase in TNF-α production in these cells. 2K. T. Iida, H. Shimano, Y. Kawakami, H. Sone, H. Toyoshima, S. Suzuki, T. Asano, Y. Okuda, and N. Yamada, unpublished data. The signaling pathway that leads to the induction of TNF-α gene and protein in insulin-stimulated macrophages has not been reported. However, it has been reported that some protein kinases are required for stimulation of the biosynthesis of cytokines in monocytes and macrophages (24Kovacs E.J. Radzioch D. Young H.A. Varesio L. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3101-3105PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hambleton J. McMahon M. DeFranco A.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26Higashimoto Y. Ohata M. Iwamoto Y. Fujimoto H. Uetani K. Suruda T. Nakamura Y. Nakai S. Funasako M. Respiration. 1995; 62: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition, recent data indicate that MAPKs play a key role in the induction of cytokine production and mRNA expression in macrophages, and, in particular, ERK-1 and ERK-2 (also called p44 and p42 MAPK, respectively) have been reported to be necessary for the stable or inducible expression of TNF-α in macrophages by some reagents, such as LPS and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (27Means T.K. Pavlovich R.P. Roca D. Vermeulen M.W. Fenton M.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Valledor A.F. Comalada M. Xaus J. Celada A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7403-7409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our results showed that ERK plays an important role in the basal biosynthesis of TNF-α in THP-1 macrophages, whereas p38 MAPK may have only a minor role. Previously, several hormones such as growth hormone, progesterone, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) have been found to regulate TNF-α production in macrophages (29Renier G. Clément I. Desfaits A.C. Lambert A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4611-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 30Miller L. Hunt J.S. J.

Physiol. 1999; 276: R1289-R1294PubMed Google Scholar). Most of these factors have been reported to inhibit TNF-α synthesis, but insulin-like growth factor I induces TNF-α synthesis in murine macrophages via its own receptor (29Renier G. Clément I. Desfaits A.C. Lambert A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4611-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the effect of insulin in TNF-α production in macrophages has not been fully investigated. Our results, which show that insulin enhanced TNF-α production at a concentration of 10−8 to 10−6m, indicate that insulin may directly regulate TNF-α production in macrophages and that insulin may not function effectively through the IGF-1 receptor because the affinity of insulin for the IGF-1 receptor is 1000 times less than that of IGF-1 (33Lowe W.L. Leroith D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the signal of insulin at high concentrations may partially be mediated through the insulin-like growth factor I receptor pathway. People with insulin resistance acquire a cluster of coronary risk factors including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance. In the past decade, many reports have suggested that hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin resistance might be a risk factor in atherosclerotic diseases such as coronary heart disease (9Reaven G.M.

Macrophages play an important role in the initial stages of atherosclerosis by taking up modified low density lipoprotein, which is accompanied by a morphological change into foam cells and secretion of various cytokines (4Steinberg D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 598: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 35Schwartz C.J. Valente A.J. Sprague E.A. Kelley J.L. Suenram C.A. Rozek M.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In addition, many cholesterol-enriched foam cells have been observed to be a characteristic aspect of the developed atherosclerotic lesions (6Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9989) Google Scholar). Here we have attempted to determine the effect of insulin action on macrophage function to gain insights into the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in lesion development, and we have shown that high concentrations of insulin within physiological concentrations increase TNF-α biosynthesis in macrophages. TNF-α induces various chemotactic proteins and growth factors of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, such as matrix metalloproteinases, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (37Galis Z.S.

Sukhova G. Lee R.T. Galis Z.S. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 25: S9-S12Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Moreover, in atheromatous plaques, TNF-α mRNA has been confirmed by hybridization techniques to be synthesized by macrophages (42Rayment N.B. Moss E. Faulkner L. Brickell P.M. Davies M.J. Woolf N. Katz D.R. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that TNF-α secreted from macrophages may contribute to the pathophysiology of the atherosclerotic plaque. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the expression and biosynthesis of TNF-α are induced by insulin through the ERK-MAPK pathway in THP-1 macrophages."

In mammalian cells it is regulated with respect to growth rate and is the target of numerous therapeutic agents. Mutations in the RNA polymerase II elongation machinery render yeast sensitive to inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase and defective in inducing transcription of one of the IMP dehydrogenase-encoding genes,IMD2. Here we show that loss of IMD2, but notIMD1, IMD3, or IMD4, conferred upon yeast the same drug sensitivity found in elongation mutants. We tested whether the drug sensitivity of elongation mutants is due to their inability to induce IMD2 by providing them with exogenous copies of the gene. In some elongation mutants, overexpression reversed drug sensitivity and a transcriptional defect. Overexpression in mutants with a more severe phenotype partially suppressed drug sensitivity but was inconsequential in reversing a defect in transcription. These findings suggest that the drug sensitivity of elongation mutants is largely but not solely attributable to defects in the ability to induce IMD2, because transcription is compromised even when IMD2 mRNA levels are adequate. We describe two DNA sequence elements in the promoter of the gene that regulate it. We also found that IMD2 mRNA abundance is coupled to cell growth rate. These findings show that yeast possess a conserved system that gauges nucleotide pools and cell growth rate and responds through a uniquely regulated member of the IMD gene family.

IMP dehydrogenase 6-azauracil polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) guanine response element IMP dehydrogenase is a rate-limiting enzyme involved in de novo GTP biosynthesis. The abundance of the enzymatic activity is correlated with the rate of growth of mammalian cells (1Collart F. Huberman E. Blood. 1990; 75: 570-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Huberman E.

Antagonists of this family of enzymes, one of which is mycophenolic acid, serve as medically important antitumor, antimicrobial, and immunosuppressive agents (4Franchetti P. Grifantini M. Curr. Med.

Mammalian IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH)1 II is inducible in a post-transcriptional manner, in response to depressed guanine nucleotide pools (3Zimmermann A.G. Gu J.J. Laliberte J. Mitchell B.S. Prog.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a family of four closely related genes, IMD1, IMD2(formerly known as PUR5), IMD3, andIMD4, that encode potential IMP dehydrogenases. They share from 58–62% amino acid identity with mammalian IMPDH I and II. The four yeast proteins are themselves highly related with pairwise alignments showing amino acid identities ranging from 80 to 96%. Our understanding of the expression and regulation of this gene family is rudimentary. The proportion of cellular enzyme activity derived from each gene is unknown, and it has not yet been shown that these putative IMPDHs possess enzyme activity.When cells are treated with drugs that inhibit IMP dehydrogenase, such as 6-azauracil (6AU) or mycophenolic acid, cellular GTP is depleted, and transcription of IMD2 is induced by an as yet unknown mechanism (9Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 10Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell.

Conversely, providing yeast with extracellular guanine down-regulates constitutive levels of IMD2 and prevents induction by IMP dehydrogenase antagonists (10Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell.

Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Elongation factor SII (also known as TFIIS) is a conserved and well studied protein that allows recovery of RNA polymerase II from arrest (reviewed in Ref. 13Wind M. Reines D. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Sensitivity to 6AU and mycophenolic acid is a phenotype characteristic of yeast with mutations in the transcription elongation machinery including a deletion of DST1 (the gene encoding yeast SII, also known as PPR2) (9Exinger F.

SII enables RNA polymerase II to complete full-length transcript synthesis in vitro and is implicated in mRNA biosynthesis in living yeast (10Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29623-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). One model suggests that this drug-sensitive phenotype results from the difficulty RNA polymerase II has in elongating nascent transcripts when it is starved for nucleotide substrates in vivo (9Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar,20Archambault J. Lacroute F. Ruet A. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4142-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Under such conditions, cell growth becomes dependent upon an optimally functioning elongation machinery. Recently, it has been suggested that the SII-dependent expression of downstream genes may play a role in the effect of the drug upon mRNA synthesis and cell physiology (10Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Shimoraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29623-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For example, the drug-induced transcription of IMD2 observed in wild-type cells is defective in a number of elongation mutants but not in 6AU-sensitive mutants not known to be involved in elongation (10Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Whether defects in transcription observed in elongation mutants are due to direct effects of the mutations upon gene transcription or are secondary to the inability to induce IMP dehydrogenase activity and obtain sufficient GTP levels to support transcription is an open question. It is possible that both mechanisms operate to reduce transcription in the presence of IMPDH inhibitors.If the drug-sensitive phenotype of elongation mutants is due to their inability to induce IMD2, we would predict that inactivation of IMD2 would lead to a drug-sensitive phenotype. Also, overexpression of IMD2 in elongationally compromised RNA polymerase II and SII mutants might rescue the drug-sensitive phenotypes. Here we test these predictions. Deletion of IMD2but not the other IMD genes phenocopies the drug sensitivity of elongation mutants. Overexpression of IMD2 in elongation mutants suggests that their drug sensitivity is largely, although not completely, due to their failure to induce IMD2 in the presence of IMPDH inhibitors. We have identified an upstream element responsible for 6AU sensitivity and a region of the IMD2promoter that is repressive for basal transcription. This and the fact that down-regulation of IMD2 by guanine was not due to altered mRNA turnover indicate that in yeast, unlike in mammalian cells, regulation is at the level of transcription. On the other hand,IMD2 transcription was sensitive to the rate of growth, as has been observed for mammalian cells. These results reveal details of the role of IMD2 in drug sensitivity and as a sensor of guanine pools with the ability to alter rates of mRNA synthesis and perhaps the cell cycle.DISCUSSIONTo understand the basis of the drug sensitivity conferred by mutations in the transcription elongation machinery, we have explored the IMD family of genes in yeast that encode the class of enzyme targeted by these drugs. Loss of IMD2 is sufficient to manifest mycophenolic acid sensitivity. Overexpression ofIMD2 suppressed to different extents two phenotypes ofS. cerevisiae elongation mutants: sensitivity of growth to inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase and transcription of an inducible gene. This analysis suggests that these mutations have additional biologically significant consequences apart from compromising theIMD2 transcriptional response, although loss of the ability to up-regulate IMPDH is an important part of the phenotype. Transcriptional control was attributable to two separate sequence elements in the promoter. The guanine-mediated repression ofIMD2 observed previously (10Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Escobar-Henriques M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol.

Hence, regulation is not likely to operate at a post-transcriptional level as seen in mammalian cells (8Glesne D.A. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5417-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These data emphasize that IMD2 is a privileged member of a four member gene family in yeast with a major role in sensing and responding to nucleotide levels and growth rate.Deletion of IMD2, one of the four genes encoding very similar IMP dehydrogenases, rendered cells sensitive to mycophenolic acid, proving that loss of the expression of this gene is sufficient to obtain drug sensitivity. Only loss of IMD2 conferred this phenotype, indicating that it contributes to growth in the presence of drug to a larger extent than the other three IMD genes and that it is uniquely regulated among the family members. This is consistent with the finding that IMD2 is the most responsive to drug treatment and guanine repression (10Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Escobar-Henriques M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1523-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Presumably, loss of all four IMD genes would result in guanine auxotrophy; however, the quadruple IMD deletant (or a triple deletant) has not yet been described.It has been suggested that yeast with mutations in the elongation machinery display sensitivity to drugs that inhibit IMP dehydrogenase because of the pharmacological reduction of GTP, a critical substrate for RNA polymerase II (9Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 20Archambault J. Lacroute F. Ruet A. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4142-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Reduced GTP levels would be expected to reduce elongation rates, increase the potential for RNA polymerase II arrest, and precipitate a stronger requirement for elongation factors (9Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 20Archambault J. Lacroute F. Ruet A. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4142-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). With the identification of the inductive response ofIMD2, it became important to examine whether the drug sensitivity was due solely to the inability of the elongation mutants to respond to drug treatment via the transcriptional up-regulation of IMD2. Alternatively, transcriptional defects in the presence of drug could result from an indirect and general effect upon RNA synthesis of limiting GTP levels. The data presented here argue that both are the case.Our approach has been to bypass the inability of elongation mutants to induce IMD2 by providing the gene on a high copy plasmid. Strains with mild drug sensitivity and reduced transcription, as monitored by GAL1 induction, showed improved growth on mycophenolic acid when transformed with a high copy plasmid containingIMD2, suggesting that a boost in GTP levels might resolve transcriptional problems. On the other hand, for more severely affected mutants, high copy expression of IMD2 incompletely suppressed drug sensitivity and reversed GAL1 induction little, if at all. This suggests that intrinsic elongation defects persist even when levels of IMD2 mRNA, and presumably GTP, are present at levels sufficient for normal growth. Thus, this class of mutations would appear to result in a defect that is independent of the IMD2 induction deficit. Presumably this involves transcription elongation on genes other thanIMD2.While our work was ongoing, the mapping of a guanine response element (GRE) in the IMD2 promoter was reported (11Escobar-Henriques M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1523-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our findings are in good general agreement with those of Escobar-Henriques and Daignan-Fornier (11Escobar-Henriques M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1523-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with one exception. These investigators found that removal or mutation of the GRE led to a loss of induction. This resulted from an increase in IMD2 basal transcription leading to mRNA levels comparable to that derived from the native promoter following mycophenolic acid induction. We found that removal of this region resulted in the loss of drug inducibility but did not elevate basal transcription. Instead, removal of a separate sequence downstream from the GRE derepressed the basal (uninduced or constitutive) level of transcription of IMD2. It is possible that derepression by guanine nucleotide depletion operates through this element. Interestingly, the derepressed promoter remained inducible in a GRE-dependent manner, indicating that an additional mechanism can activate transcription. Thus, in our assays, the GRE played a positive role and a second element near the transcription start site played a negative one. Differences in the reporter assays used by Escobar-Henriques and Daignan-Fornier (11Escobar-Henriques M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1523-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and us may account for this disparity. The function of the repressive sequence was portable to a heterologus inducible promoter and showed strict orientation dependence. Although the repressive sequence contains a good match to a consensus TATA box (TATAA), the TATAA sequence is immediately adjacent to the transcription start site, a spacing that makes it an unlikely candidate for TBP binding and traditional TATA box function. The region does not function as a TATA box because its removal leads to elevated basal activity. Furthermore, inducible promoter function remained intact in its absence. Also, substantial start site positioning activity can be attributed to the remaining promoter sequences after deletion of the repressive element. It is unclear how either promoter element functions or what proteins might be their cognate ligands. Bas1p and Bas2p, transcription factors that regulate adenine metabolism, are not involved in IMD2induction, nor are the transcription factors Swi5p, Hap3p, or Gcn4p, for which consensus binding sites are present in the promoter (11Escobar-Henriques M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1523-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 2R. Shaw, unpublished results. The −31 to +35 region is highly conserved between IMD1 and IMD2with only four nucleotide differences. IMD1 is thought to be poorly expressed because of its proximity to the telomere of chromosome I (32Barton A. Bussey H. Storms R. Kaback D. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The repressive element is less well conserved betweenIMD2 and IMD3 (63% identity) and is essentially unrecognizable in the IMD4 promoter.The extent to which the IMD1-IMD4 gene products contribute to cellular IMPDH activity is unknown. IMD2 is the dominant IMD mRNA species under induced and uninduced conditions based upon experiments in IMDdeletion strains (10Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 32Barton A. Bussey H. Storms R. Kaback D. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This suggests that it is the major contributor to enzyme abundance and activity in vivo. However, determinations of enzyme levels or a direct measurement of IMPDH activity has not been made in such strains.Our analysis of GAL1 induction led to the unexpected observation that wild-type cells showed an increased ability to induceGAL1 when they harbored additional copies ofIMD2. This suggests that IMP dehydrogenase activity and GTP levels might be rate-limiting for RNA synthesis under normal vegetative growth conditions and is interesting in light of the correlation between IMP dehydrogenase activity and mammalian cell proliferation including tumor cell growth. Unlike logarithmically growing cells, cultures allowed to approach saturation showed a precipitous loss of the IMD2 mRNA. Thus, IMD2 transcription appears to be sensitive to the growth state of yeast. The mechanism by which this occurs is unclear but is observed in a culture long before the general decline in transcription and mRNA levels seen in post-diauxic and stationary phase yeast cultures (47Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that IMD2 overexpression could accelerate the rate of cell growth. However, the presence of high copy plasmid-borne IMD2 was not sufficient to increase the growth rate of wild-type yeast. 3J. Wilson, unpublished results. Further analysis will be required to determine the mechanism by which cellular growth state is related to IMD2 transcription. IMP dehydrogenase is a rate-limiting enzyme involved in de novo GTP biosynthesis. The abundance of the enzymatic activity is correlated with the rate of growth of mammalian cells (1Collart F.

Antagonists of this family of enzymes, one of which is mycophenolic acid, serve as medically important antitumor, antimicrobial, and immunosuppressive agents (4Franchetti P. Grifantini M. Curr. Med.

Characterization of two IMP dehydrogenase genes in mammalian cells has included an analysis of their promoters and the solution of a crystal structure of rodent IMP dehydrogenase in a complex with mycophenolic acid (5Sintchak M.D..

Mammalian IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH)1 II is inducible in a post-transcriptional manner, in response to depressed guanine nucleotide pools (3Zimmermann A.G. Gu J.J. Laliberte J. Mitchell B.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 181-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Glesne D.A. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5417-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a family of four closely related genes, IMD1, IMD2(formerly known as PUR5), IMD3, andIMD4, that encode potential IMP dehydrogenases. They share from 58–62% amino acid identity with mammalian IMPDH I and II. The four yeast proteins are themselves highly related with pairwise alignments showing amino acid identities ranging from 80 to 96%. Our understanding of the expression and regulation of this gene family is rudimentary. The proportion of cellular enzyme activity derived from each gene is unknown, and it has not yet been shown that these putative IMPDHs possess enzyme activity. When cells are treated with drugs that inhibit IMP dehydrogenase, such as 6-azauracil (6AU) or mycophenolic acid, cellular GTP is depleted, and transcription of IMD2 is induced by an as yet unknown mechanism (9Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 10Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1523-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Conversely, providing yeast with extracellular guanine down-regulates constitutive levels of IMD2 and prevents induction by IMP dehydrogenase antagonists (10Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Escobar-Henriques M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol.

In vitro, ribonucleotide concentration is a direct determinant of transcript elongation rate and the propensity of RNA polymerase II to become arrested during RNA chain elongation (12Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Elongation factor SII (also known as TFIIS) is a conserved and well studied protein that allows recovery of RNA polymerase II from arrest (reviewed in Ref. 13Wind M. Reines D. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Sensitivity to 6AU and mycophenolic acid is a phenotype characteristic of yeast with mutations in the transcription elongation machinery including a deletion of DST1 (the gene encoding yeast SII, also known as PPR2) (9Exinger F.

One model suggests that this drug-sensitive phenotype results from the difficulty RNA polymerase II has in elongating nascent transcripts when it is starved for nucleotide substrates in vivo (9Exinger F.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2872-2878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the importance of ACP in these diverse physiological processes, very little is known about how specific amino acid residues in this small acidic protein contribute to its three-dimensional structure and interactions with various enzymes. Do different regions and residues of ACP interact with different enzymes? If so, what effect does altering ACP structure have on the multiple metabolic pathways that compete for acyl groups? Escherichia coli ACP (77 amino acids, molecular weight 8847) is the prototypical type II dissociated ACP found in bacteria, plastids, and mitochondria. Two-dimensional NMR has revealed thatE. coli ACP has a defined but flexible tertiary structure dominated by three major parallel α-helices located at residues 3–14 (I), 37–51 (II), and 65–75 (III) (13Kim Y. Prestegard J.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These helices enclose a hydrophobic core along their length, providing a binding pocket for fatty acids, which are covalently attached by a thioester bond to the 4-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group located at Ser-36 (14Mayo K.H. Prestegard J.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fatty acid binding has little influence on ACP conformation under physiological conditions (15Jones P.J.

Simpson T.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6000-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) exhibit tertiary structural features similar to E. coli ACP, indicating a remarkable degree of ACP structural conservation, which may in turn reflect constrained evolution of a protein with multiple interacting partners. Indeed, ACPs from different organisms can be functionally interchanged in some biochemical processes. Spinach andE. coli ACPs are utilized with similar efficiency by plant fatty acid synthases, although many corresponding E. colienzymes exhibit a preference for bacterial ACP (21Guerra D.J. Browse J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Guerra D.J. Dziewanowska K. Ohlrogge J.B. Beremand P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More distantly related ACP-like proteins can also be substrates for bacterial enzymes: the NodF factor involved in Rhizobium lipochitin synthesis is accepted by several E. coli fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes, but E. coli ACP cannot be used in reciprocal nodulation reactions (23Ritsema T. Gehring A.M. Stuitje A.R. Van der Drift K.M.G.M. Dandal I. Lambalot R.H. Walsh C.T. Thomas-Oates J.E. Lugtenberg B.J.J. Spaink H.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although no general pattern emerges from these studies, they do indicate that some enzymes are more discriminating than others in their interactions with ACP. An additional role of ACP is to provide myristic acid (14:0) for bioluminescence in Gram-negative marine bacteria, such as Vibrio harveyi (24Byers D.M. Meighen E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6085-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Ferri S.R. Meighen E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12852-12857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this process, myristic acid is diverted from further elongation to aldehyde synthesis by a luminescence-specific myristoyl-ACP thioesterase. Myristic acid may be reactivated to ACP by the soluble acyl-ACP synthetase that is present in this organism (26Fice D. Shen Z. Byers D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1865-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,27Shen Z. Byers D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 77-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent cloning and isolation of V. harveyi ACP did not reveal any features that were potentially unique to its role in bioluminescence (28Shen Z.W. Byers D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 571-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, V. harveyi and E. coli ACP amino acid sequences are 86% identical, and only one of the 11 differences involves a nonconservative change in a helical region: Val instead of Gly at position 12 in V. harveyi ACP. These ACPs also share many biophysical properties (29De la Roche M.A. Shen Z.W. Byers D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used the V. harveyi ACP gene as a template for site-directed mutagenesis to dissect the role of individual amino acid residues in ACP structure and function, specifically those implicated in interactions with covalently attached fatty acids. [9,10-3H]Myristic acid (49 Ci/mmol) and [α-35S]dATP (1250 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. pGEX-5X-3 vector, T7 sequencing kit, glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and SOURCE 15Q anion exchange resin were fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Unlabeled fatty acids and E. coli holo-ACP were purchased from Sigma. Gel electrophoresis equipment and reagents were from Bio-Rad, whereas GelCode protein stain and Micro BCA protein assay reagents were from Pierce. Factor Xa restriction protease was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other chemicals used in this study were of the highest purity available. The V. harveyi acpP gene (GenBankTM accession number U39441 (28Shen Z.W. Byers D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 571-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was amplified from a genomic V. harveyi library by PCR using forward (5′-AGGATCCCAATGAGCAACATCGAAGAACGCGTAAAG) and reverse (5′-GCTCGAGAATTACTGAGCGCTGTTTACGTAGTC) primers that contained restriction sites for BamHI and XhoI (underlined), and the PCR product was ligated into the pGEX-5X-3 vector for expression as a GST fusion protein. Mutations were introduced into the coding region of ACP using the MORPH site-specific plasmid DNA mutagenesis kit (Eppendorf-5′ Inc.) and mutation specific oligonucleotides (27–33-mer, Life Technologies, Inc.); all mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Plasmids encoding GST-ACP fusion proteins were maintained in E. coli DH5α and transformed into chemically competent E. coli BL-21 cells (Stratagene) for protein expression. Factor Xa cleavage of the GST-ACP product yields a recombinant V. harveyi ACP (rACP) with an N-terminal extension of four amino acids (GIPM). Recombinant ACPs were produced by induction of 100 ml of mid-log phase cells (A 600 = 0.5) in LB medium with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Cell pellets were suspended in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, sonicated (six bursts of 30 s), and incubated 30 min on ice with 1% Triton X-100 prior to centrifugation (27,000 ×g for 15 min). To ensure complete conversion of any GST-apo-ACP to the holo form, the cell free extract was diluted to 5 ml with phosphate-buffered saline containing (final concentrations) 1 mm coenzyme A, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 100 μl of a crude cell extract containingE. coli holo-ACP synthase (0.5 mg of protein) prepared exactly as described (30Lambalot R.H. Walsh C.T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This solution was then incubated with 2 ml (packed volume) of glutathione-Sepharose 4B in an end-over-end mixer for 2 h at 25 °C. After centrifugation and washing with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound proteins, the resin was incubated overnight at 25 °C with 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2 and 15 μg of Factor Xa protease (total volume, 4 ml). The mixture was transferred to a minicolumn, drained, and washed with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Fractions containing ACP were dialyzed against 10 mm MES (pH 6.0) and 2 mm DTT, and ACP was purified to homogeneity on a 10-ml SOURCE 15Q anion exchange column (Waters 650 protein chromatograph) using a linear gradient (30 ml) of 0–1 m NaCl in the above buffer. Separation of any residual apo-ACP from holo-ACP was also achieved by this step, and final yield was typically 1–2 mg (0.1–0.2 μmol) of ACP. ACP purification was monitored byA 280 or by conversion to [3H]myristoyl-ACP using partially purified V. harveyi acyl-ACP synthetase and [3H]myristic acid as described below. Native V. harveyi ACP and E. coli apo-ACP (obtained by overnight induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside of strain MR19 containing a synthetic ACP gene (31Keating D.H. Rawlings Carey M. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22229-22235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)) were purified on the basis of their solubility in 50% isopropanol, followed by anion exchange chromatography as described previously (29De la Roche M.A. Shen Z.W. Byers D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). ACPs or acyl-ACPs were resolved by conformationally sensitive native gel electrophoresis (native PAGE) (18Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Armitage I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2669-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) carried out at 37 °C (25 mA/gel) on a 20% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad mini-Protean II system). Electrophoresis at neutral pH was performed at 4 °C (150 V) on 20% gels using a continuous buffer system of 43 mm imidazole and 35 mm HEPES at pH 7.4 (32McLellan T. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized by staining with GelCode reagent, and in some experiments, labeled acyl-ACPs were confirmed by fluorography (27Shen Z. Byers D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 77-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD spectra were measured using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter and a 0.1-cm water-jacketed cell at 25 °C. Samples were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7) and centrifuged, and aliquots removed for protein determination. Spectra were recorded from 260 to 190 nm in continuous mode, with a scanning speed of 10 nm/min. In some experiments, 0.01 volumes of 1m MgCl2 were added directly to the sample after measurement, and the CD spectrum was remeasured after a 30-min incubation. V. harveyi acyl-ACP synthetase was partially purified by DEAE-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-300 chromatography, which provides a stable source of enzyme activity and removes endogenous ACP (26Fice D. Shen Z. Byers D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1865-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme preparation used for determination of kinetic parameters with mutant ACPs was 1.3 mg of protein/ml and 3.5 units/mg (1 unit = 1 nmol of product formed per min under standard assay conditions (33Shen Z. Fice D. Byers D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)). Assays were performed at 37 °C in a final volume of 15 μl containing 80 μm[3H]myristic acid (800 dpm/pmol), 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and 1–60 μmACP in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 5 mm DTT. Acyl-ACP synthetase (2 milliunits) was added to start the reaction, and samples (10 μl) were removed at 10 min; acyl-ACP formation was measured after spotting on filter paper and washing with methanol/chloroform/acetic acid (6/3/1, v/v) to remove unbound fatty acid (33Shen Z. Fice D. Byers D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Blank values from reactions conducted in the absence of ACP (<200 dpm) were subtracted, and kinetic parameters (V max and K m) were calculated using Eadie-Hofstee plots. The assay was linear under these conditions (<20% conversion of limiting ACP substrate). Acyl-ACP synthetase was also used to prepare acyl-ACPs for native PAGE analysis and [3H]myristoyl-ACP substrates for thioesterase assay (see below), except that the reaction was allowed to proceed up to 4 h to achieve quantitative conversion to acyl-ACP (33Shen Z. Fice D. Byers D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Samples for electrophoresis were mixed with 0.33 volumes of 4× native sample buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 45% (v/v) glycerol, bromphenol blue). [3H]Myristoyl-ACP substrates were further purified by application to a 1 ml DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated in 10 mm MES, pH 6.0. After washing with buffer alone and with 50% isopropanol to remove fatty acid, [3H]myristoyl-ACP was eluted with 0.5 m NaCl and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. V. harveyimyristoyl-ACP thioesterase was partially purified as described (34Byers D. Meighen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6938-6944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells from bright luminescent culture (650 ml, A 660 = 2) were harvested and lysed by sonication in 50 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 5 mm DTT. The cell-free extract was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation, and the 30–50% precipitate was dissolved in 10 ml of the above buffer, applied to a SOURCE 15Q column, and eluted with a linear gradient (30 ml total) to 0.5 msodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 5 mm DTT. Fractions containing thioesterase activity were identified by [3H]myristoyl-ACP cleavage (below); the 32-kDa enzyme was judged to be about 50% pure at this stage based on protein staining. Myristoyl-ACP thioesterase activity was measured in glass tubes by incubating 0.2–1 μl of enzyme preparation with 25 nm[3H]myristoyl-ACP in 1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for 5 min at 25 °C. The reaction (100 μl total volume) was stopped by addition of 10 μl of acetic acid followed by extraction of released [3H]myristic acid into 1 ml of hexane (24Byers D.M. Meighen E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6085-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The presence of the 4′-phosphopantetheine sulfhydryl group of holo-ACP was determined using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (35Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21467) Google Scholar). Briefly, solid urea and DTT were added to ACP samples to give final concentrations of 8 and 0.1m, respectively, and mixtures were incubated 1 h at 37 °C. After separation of ACP and DTT on a small Sephadex-G25 column, the amount of free thiol was calculated from the absorbance at 412 nm (ε = 13, 600 m−1cm−1). Protein concentrations were measured using the Micro BCA assay, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Site-directed mutagenesis is an important approach for understanding protein structure and function, but its application to acyl carrier protein has been hampered by the toxicity of E. coli ACP when overexpressed in E. coli (31Keating D.H. Rawlings Carey M. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22229-22235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To investigate residues involved in specific ACP functions and properties such as acyl chain interaction, we constructed a GST-V. harveyi ACP fusion protein template for alteration of amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis. V. harveyi and E. coli ACPs are among the most similar, characterized in terms of primary structure (86% sequence identity (28Shen Z.W. Byers D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 571-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and hydrodynamic properties (29De la Roche M.A. Shen Z.W. Byers D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Four residues that are identical in E. coli and V. harveyi ACP (Phe-50, Ile-54, Ala-59, and Tyr-71) have been previously implicated in interaction with the first 6–8 carbons of covalently attached acyl groups by NMR (14Mayo K.H. Prestegard J.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Jones P.J. Cioffi E.A. Prestegard J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8963-8965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and difference spectroscopy (37Rock C.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.1, these fatty acid binding pocket residues are located in a discrete region near the N and C termini,i.e. where they could potentially interact directly with acyl chains esterified to the phosphopantetheine attached at Ser-36 (38Holak T.A. Kearsley S.K. Kim Y. Prestegard J.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6135-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All four side chains are at least partially buried in a hydrophobic core, with all but Tyr-71 potentially exposed to the acyl chain on the same face of the protein as Ser-36. These residues are also identical in 95% (Phe-50), 86% (Ile-54), 88% (Ala-59), and 62% (Tyr-71) of 56 ACP sequences examined in the nonredundant data base. Circular dichroism was used to assess whether the N-terminal extension of four amino acids and/or mutations introduced in the fatty acid binding pocket alter the secondary structure of rACP. The far UV CD spectrum of E. coli ACP in phosphate buffer at pH 7 was consistent with previous reports indicating an α-helix content of 40–50% (39Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2299-2304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, we were surprised to find that bothV. harveyi native and rACP exhibited CD spectra more typical of random coil conformation under these conditions (Fig.2). Schulz (39Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2299-2304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that charge neutralization by divalent cation binding, which has little effect on native E. coli ACP conformation at neutral pH, can prevent loss of secondary structure that occurs due to electrostatic repulsion either at elevated pH or upon acetylation of lysine residues at neutral pH (39Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2299-2304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, addition of 10 mm MgCl2 to either V. harveyi native or rACP caused a dramatic shift to a more typical native-like conformation but had little effect onE. coli ACP (Fig. 2). Thus, we conclude that V. harveyi ACP, which is slightly more acidic than the E. coli protein (28Shen Z.W. Byers D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 571-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is partially denatured at physiological pH in the absence of divalent cations. CD analysis of the effect of Mg2+ on secondary structure was extended to several mutant derivatives of ACP (Fig.3). Like V. harveyi and rACP, all fatty acid binding pocket mutants except I54A and F50A exhibited a 3-fold increase in the magnitude of [θ]220 in the presence of this cation, indicating a substantial increase in helical content and native-like conformation under these conditions. A similar trend was observed for mutant V12G, which involves the nonconservative replacement of Val-12 within helix I with Gly found at the corresponding position in E. coli ACP. By contrast, the magnitude of [θ]220 was lower for I54A and F50A ACPs in the absence of Mg2+, and this value was increased less than 1.5-fold by addition of Mg2+ to the sample, indicating that these mutant ACPs are incapable of adopting native conformation. Further evidence that mutants I54A and F50A are not in a compact folded conformation even in the presence of Mg2+ was obtained by electrophoresis at neutral pH (Fig. 4). Under these conditions, in which recombinant and mutant ACPs should have approximately equivalent charge, most mutants exhibited identical mobility to rACP, indicating a similar hydrodynamic radius. However, the mobilities of F50A and especially I54A were decreased relative to the other proteins, suggesting that these mutant ACPs have a greater hydrodynamic radius. Mobilities of E. coli and V. harveyi ACPs were also measured by neutral pH PAGE (Fig. 4), but the results using this sensitive technique are not directly comparable to rACP and mutant derivatives due to more extensive differences in protein charge and/or size. Native E. coli and V. harveyi ACPs, rACP, and several mutant derivatives were tested as substrates for V. harveyiacyl-ACP synthetase, a soluble enzyme that activates a broad range of fatty acids to acyl-ACP with hydrolysis of ATP to AMP (26Fice D. Shen Z. Byers D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1865-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, no difference inK m was observed between rACP and the two native ACPs. Although comparison of V max between rACP and V. harveyi ACP indicated a modest effect of the four additional N-terminal amino acids in the former, uncleaved GST-ACP was myristoylated with comparable efficiency (not shown), indicating a general tolerance of acyl-ACP synthetase to N-terminal ACP extensions. Most fatty acid binding pocket ACP mutants exhibited significantly decreased acyl-ACP synthetase efficiency relative to rACP (Table I). Increased K m values were observed with all mutants except Y71A, for which a significantly decreased K mwas measured. V max was also significantly decreased with mutants Y71A and I54L, and it was greatly reduced for mutant F50A, which was a very poor substrate for this enzyme. No activity was observed for I54A (but see below), and more conservative replacements at this position (I54L and I54V) resulted in substantially decreased catalytic efficiency. By comparison, mutant V12G was a relatively effective substrate for acyl-ACP synthetase. It should be noted that acyl-ACP synthetase assays are carried out in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2, suggesting that all but F50A and I54A ACPs would be in a native-like conformation under these conditions.Table IKinetic parameters of V. harveyi acyl-ACP synthetase with native, recombinant, and mutant ACPsACP substrateV maxK mRelative efficiency1-aCatalytic efficiency (V max/K m) relative to that of rACP.pmol/min/μgμmE. coli ACP3.8 ± 0.79.4 ± 4.20.92V. harveyi ACP2.3 ± 0.17.9 ± 3.00.67rACP3.8 ± 0.68.7 ± 1.6(1.0)V12G2.2 ± 0.27.3 ± 0.30.69F50A0.3 ± 0.117 ± 20.04I54A—1-bNo activity, as ACP is in apo form (values not significantly above background).——I54L2.6 ± 0.929 ± 30.20I54V4.8 ± 0.635 ± 40.31A59G3.1 ± 0.513 ± 30.54Y71A1.1 ± 0.33.0 ± 0.40.84Mean ± S.D. of at least three experiments for each ACP are shown.1-a Catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) relative to that of rACP.1-b No activity, as ACP is in apo form (values not significantly above background). Open table in a new tab Mean ± S.D. of at least three experiments for each ACP are shown. Failure to acylate ACP I54A could be due either to lack of acyl-ACP synthetase activity with this substrate or to inability of hostE. coli holo-ACP synthase to modify the mutant GST-ACP with phosphopantetheine during isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. Although fusion proteins were routinely treated with partially purified E. coli ACP synthase in vitro before cleavage, resulting in essentially complete conversion of most ACPs to the holo form, the latter possibility was tested by treating cleaved ACP I54A with ACP synthase followed by native PAGE analysis at pH 9, in which electrophoretic mobility is sensitive to modification at Ser-36 (18Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Armitage I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2669-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the amount of ACP synthase used was sufficient to completely convert E. coliapo-ACP to holo-ACP, which could be further [3H]myristoylated in a reaction coupled to V. harveyi acyl-ACP synthetase. By contrast, mutant I54A ACP was not modified by these treatments (the small amount of labeled acyl-ACP observed is due to contamination of the ACP synthase extract with native E. coli ACP). This conclusion was confirmed using the Ellman assay for free sulfhydryl groups (35Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 8"

The crystal structure of recombinantEscherichia coli NrdH-redoxin in the oxidized state has been determined at 1.7 Å resolution by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction. NrdH-redoxin belongs to the thioredoxin superfamily and is structurally most similar to E. coliglutaredoxin 3 and phage T4 glutaredoxin. The angle between the C-terminal helix α3 and strand β4, which differs between thioredoxin and glutaredoxin, has an intermediate value in NrdH-redoxin. The orientation of this helix is to a large extent determined by an extended hydrogen-bond network involving the highly conserved sequence motif61WSGFRP(D/E)67, which is unique to this subclass of the thioredoxin superfamily. Residues that bind glutathione in glutaredoxins are in general not conserved in NrdH-redoxin, and no glutathione-binding cleft is present. Instead, NrdH-redoxin contains a wide hydrophobic pocket at the surface, similar to thioredoxin. Modeling studies suggest that NrdH-redoxin can interact with E. coli thioredoxin reductase at this pocket and also via a loop that is complementary to a crevice in the reductase in a similar manner as observed in the E. colithioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase complex.

Characteristics of this family are the common fold and a conserved sequence motif, CXXC, which contains the redox active cysteine residues. A distinctive feature between thioredoxins and glutaredoxins is the pattern of residues linking these two cysteine residues,i.e. CGPC for thioredoxin and CPYC for most glutaredoxins (3Martin J.L.

These two ubiquitous small redox proteins (molecular mass, 9–12 kDa) have been identified in numerous organisms and are, in their dithiol form, the major disulfide reductases in cells (2Holmgren A.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). They perform a large number of functions in cell growth, such as redox control of transcription factors (7Dalton T.P. Shertzer H.G. Puga A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 67-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), electron transport to ribonucleotide reductase (8Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). Glutaredoxins are specifically reduced by glutathione (GSH), whereas thioredoxins depend on thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) for reduction. Recently, members of a new class of small redox proteins, glutaredoxin-like proteins, NrdH-redoxin (NrdH), have been found inEscherichia coli and several other organisms, in particular organisms lacking GSH (9Jordan A.

Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18044-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). NrdH proteins typically show sequence identities in the range of 34–85% and are homologous to glutaredoxins. For instance, the Lactococcus lactis NrdH redoxin has 27% sequence identity to E. coli glutaredoxin-3 and 17% identity to glutaredoxin-1 (9Jordan A. Pontis E. Åslund F. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8779-8785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). NrdHredoxin also contains the active site motif CXXC as in Trx and Grx, but the intervening residues (valine and glutamine) are different from both these classes. Although NrdH is related in amino sequence to glutaredoxins, it behaves functionally as a thioredoxin. It is not reduced by GSH but by thioredoxin reductase, it has a low redox potential, and it can reduce insulin disulfides; these biochemical features are characteristic of thioredoxin (10Jordan A.

To elucidate the structural basis of the thioredoxin-like activity profile of the glutaredoxin homologue NrdH, we have solved the crystal structure of E. coli NrdH to 1.7 Å by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction. Comparison of the three-dimensional structure of NrdH with that of other redoxins suggests a hydrophobic pocket at the surface and a loop between helix α2 and strand β3 as common determinants in the recognition and binding of Trx and NrdH to thioredoxin reductase. The architecture of this hydrophobic pocket is completely different from the glutathione binding cleft in glutaredoxins, thus preventing binding of glutathione. Plasmid pUA625, containing the gene forE. coli NrdH (10Jordan A. Åslund F. Pontis E. Reichard P. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18044-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was transformed into BL21-CodonPlus (Stratagene), and the cells containing pUA625 were grown as described (10Jordan A. Åslund F. Pontis E. Reichard P. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18044-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To produce the NrdH selenomethionine derivative, E. coli BL21-CodonPlus cells with the expression vector pUA625 were grown at 37 °C in 1-liter flasks in M9 medium (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. After ∼4–5 h, (A 578 = 0.6), methionine biosynthesis was suppressed using an amino acid mixture as described (14Doublié S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) including l-selenomethionine (50 mg liter−1). After 15 min the culture was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1.0 mm. The cells were harvested after 4 h by centrifugation, and the pellet (2.4 g) was stored at −20 °C. Purification of E. coli NrdH followed a protocol described elsewhere (10Jordan A. Åslund F. Pontis E. Reichard P. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18044-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The yield was usually 110 mg of pure protein per 8 g of cells. The selenomethionine-substituted protein was purified in the same way as the wild-type protein without the Sephadex G-50 gel filtration column and by adding 5 mm dithiothreitol to all buffer solutions. The yield was 17 mg of pure protein per 2.4 g of cells. The homogeneity of the purified proteins was analyzed with SDS gel electrophoresis. The protein concentration was determined with Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce). The incorporation of four selenomethionine residues was confirmed by mass spectrometry at the Protein Analysis Center, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institute Stockholm. Crystals of native and Se-methionine substituted E. coli NrdH were obtained by vapor diffusion. The native protein solution was dialyzed against 0.05m CHES buffer, pH 9.1 and concentrated to 16 mg/ml. 3 μl of protein solution was mixed with 3 μl of mother liquor (1.20m sodium citrate, 200 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 5% 2-methyl-2,4-pentane-diol). Hanging drops were equilibrated against the mother liquor at 20 °C. Needles, up to 1 mm in length and 0.05 mm in diameter, were obtained after 1–2 weeks. Se-methionine-substituted NrdH was dialyzed against 0.05 mCHES buffer, pH 9.1, 5 mm dithiothreitol and concentrated to 16 mg/ml. 2 μl of the protein solution were mixed with 2 μl of mother liquor (95 mm CHES, pH 8.7, 950 mmsodium citrate, 4.7% isopropyl alcohol) and equilibrated against 1 ml of mother liquor at 20 °C. Thin plates of 0.02 × 0.02 × 0.05 mm were obtained after 1 week. A native diffraction data set was collected at 100 K at beam line 711 of MAX-LabII (Lund, Sweden) with a MAR Research imaging plate. The MAD-diffraction data set was collected at 100 K at beam line BM14 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) with a MAR charge-coupled device detector. Before transfer into the nitrogen gas stream the crystals were soaked for a few seconds in a solution of 69 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 1.0 msodium citrate, 17.3% glycerol, 0.045 m spermidine, 3.5% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. All data sets were processed with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (15Otwinoski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38572) Google Scholar), or the CCP4 suite of programs (16Collaborative Computational Project No. 4, Daresbury, UK, Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D, 50, 1994, 760, 763.Google Scholar). The native crystals belong to space group P212121 with cell dimensions ofa = 31.2 Å, b = 41.3 Å,c = 58.7 Å and contain one molecule per asymmetric unit. The selenomethionine crystals belong to space group P21 with cell dimensions a = 41.2 Å,b = 29.9 Å, c = 55.4 Å, β = 89.6° and two molecules per asymmetric unit. Data for MAD phasing were collected at three different wavelengths to 2.9 Å resolution (Table I). Six selenium sites were identified using the program SOLVE (17Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The positions and occupancies of the selenium sites, as well as values for f′ and f′′ for two wavelengths were refined further in SHARP (18De La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Density modification and NCS-averaging to 3 Å in the program DM (19Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The coordinates and structure factors have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank, accession code 1H75 and r1H75sf, respectively. The refined model of NrdH at 1.7 Å resolution contains residues 1–76 of the protein and 82 water molecules. The polypeptide chain is well defined in the electron density map (Fig. 1), except for the last five residues, which were not visible in the electron density map, probably because of disorder. The side chain of Arg35 has been modeled in two different conformations, with relative occupancies of 0.7 and 0.3, respectively. NrdH is a compact molecule with overall dimensions of 18 × 24 × 37 Å and a surface of 5141 Å2. The structure consists of a four-stranded β-sheet with topology −1x, +2x, +1 and three flanking helices, a fold that is characteristic of the thioredoxin superfamily (3Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Helix α2 runs roughly perpendicular to helices α1 and α3. Acis-proline (Pro52), found at the beginning of strand β3, is highly conserved among proteins of the thioredoxin family. In NrdH-like proteins the chain comprising the end of β4, the following loop, and the beginning of helix α3 contains a highly conserved sequence motif,61WSGFRP(D/E)67 (Fig.3 A). A pattern scan in Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL showed that this pattern is unique to NrdH proteins. The position of helix α3 relative to the remaining part of the molecule is to a large extend determined by an intricate network of hydrogen bonds formed by the WSGFRP(D/E) motif, two water molecules, and surrounding protein residues (Fig. 3). A central role is played by a water molecule, which forms hydrogen bonds to atom Nε1 of Trp61, Oγ1 of Thr17, and main chain oxygen and nitrogen atoms of Gly63 and Arg65, respectively. Another water molecule interacts with the main chain oxygen of residue Ser62 and NH1 of Arg65. The latter residue forms a salt-bridge with Asp67 at the entrance to helix α3. The main chain nitrogen atom of Phe64 forms a hydrogen bond with side chain atom Oε of Gln13, a residue that is part of the active site. The structurally most similar proteins to NrdH in the PDB data base are E. coli Grx3 (28Nordstrand K. Sandström A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Otting G. Berndt K.D. J. Mol.

Montfort W.R Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13979-13988Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Table III). These proteins all belong to the thioredoxin superfamily and share the thioredoxin fold. Although NrdH does not bind GSH, the overall structure is most similar to Grx and is less similar to Trx (Table III).Table IIIStructural similarities of NrdH redoxin with other redoxins in the thioredoxin familyMoleculeEquivalent residuesIdentical residuesr.m.s.d.ÅE. coli Glutaredoxin 3 (1FOV)66141.54T4 Glutaredoxin (1AAZ)62171.49A. thaliana glutathioneS-transferase (1GNW)58141.26E. coli thioredoxin (2TRX)5571.36human thioredoxin (1AUC)4671.36 Open table in a new tab A comparison of NrdH with the structures of Grx and Trx from E. coli shows that despite the high overall similarity, all three proteins have distinctive features, which are typical for their subclass (Fig. 4). The N-terminal part is structurally most similar among all three proteins. Strands β1, β2, and β3, as well as helix α1 and the N termini of the helices α2 align well among the three proteins (Fig. 4). The C-terminal part is structurally less conserved. The most striking difference between these structures is the orientation of helix α3 in relation to strand β4 (Fig. 4 B). Trx has a rather long connection between strand β4 and helix α3, and α3 is almost antiparallel to the strand. In Grx the chain instead immediately adopts helix conformation after strand β4 and this helix is then approximately perpendicular to the helix in Trx. In NrdH the connecting loop is longer than in Grx but shorter than in Trx resulting in a helix orientation in between that of Trx and Grx3 (Fig. 4 B). Trx contains one additional β-strand and one helix at the N terminus, which are not present in NrdH and Grx (29Eklund H. Ingelman M. Söderberg B.O. Uhlin T. Nordlund P. Nikkola M. Sonnerstam U. Joelson T. Petratos K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 596-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Xia T.H. Bushweller J.H. Sodano P. Billeter M. Björnberg O. Holmgren A. Wüthrich K. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Trx also has a longer helix α1 and a shorter helix α2 than NrdH and Grx. The loop from helix α2 to strand β3 in Trx (residues 70–75) occupies a complementary groove on the surface of thioredoxin reductase (24Lennon B.W. Williams Jr., C.H. Ludwig M.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1190-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) upon binding. The longer helix α2 of NrdH shifts the position of this loop compared with its location in Trx (Fig. 4). Strand β4 and the following loop to helix α3 are more similar between NrdH and Trx than between NrdH and Grx3 (Fig. 4 B). At the tip of strand β4 is a glycine residue (position 63 in NrdH, and 92 in E. coli Trx), which is conserved in the superfamily (34Eklund H. Cambillau C. Sjöberg B.M. Holmgren A. Jörnvall H. Höög J.O. Brändén C.I. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1443-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This residue has been shown to be important in binding of Trx to other molecules, such as T7 DNA polymerase, TrxR (35Holmgren A. Kallis G.B. Nordström B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3118-3124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or in the assembly of filamentous phages (36Russel M. Model P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14997-15005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Archaebacteria contain small redox proteins of as yet unknown function, which are similar in sequence to the glutaredoxins (19–30% sequence identity), but do not react with glutathione (37Lee D.Y. Ahn B.-Y. Kim K.-S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6652-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 38Cave J.W. Cho H.S. Batchelder A.M. Yokota H. Kim R. Wemmer D.E. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These redoxins are also related in amino acid sequence to NrdH proteins, with about 20% sequence identities, and it has therefore been suggested that they may form a common subgroup in the thioredoxin superfamily (38Cave J.W. Cho H.S. Batchelder A.M. Yokota H. Kim R. Wemmer D.E. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Comparison of the three-dimensional structure of NrdH with the solution structure of the reduced form of an archaebacterial redoxin, Mj0307 from Methanococcus jannaschii (38Cave J.W. Cho H.S. Batchelder A.M. Yokota H. Kim R. Wemmer D.E. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), reveals that the structures are not as similar as one might expect for members of the same subgroup. In fact, superposition gives a r.m.s. of 2.0 Å with 45 equivalent Cα atoms, significantly worse than superposition of NrdH with Grx or Trx (Table III). Furthermore, these archaebacterial sequences do not contain the 61WSGFRP(D/E)67sequence motif typical of the mesophilic NrdH redoxins. These differences suggest that the two proteins are not members of one subgroup but represent different subgroups of the thioredoxin family. The active site of E. coli NrdH is located at the beginning of helix α1. The electron density map clearly shows formation of a disulfide bond between residues Cys11 and Cys14, and the structure of NrdH described here is thus that of the oxidized protein. The N-terminal cysteine of the CXXC motif provides the reactive thiolate in the reduced protein (2Holmgren A. Structure. 1995; 3: 239-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 39Jeng M.-F. Campbell A.P. Begley T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Dyson A.J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10298-10306Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and is more solvent accessible whereas the C-terminal cysteine side chain is buried. Although the active sites of NrdH, Trx, and Grx are quite similar, NrdH is more similar to Trx than to Grx. In particular, the φ, ψ, and χ angles for the first cysteine of the active site are more similar to Trx than to Grx (TableIV). Compared with Grx the φ angle shows a difference of about 40° but only 18° difference compared with Trx. The ψ angle of NrdH is 108° and is similar to E. coli Trx (108°), whereas the glutaredoxins have angles about 86–96°. Also in the χ angle, NrdH and Grx differs about 18–24°, whereas NrdH and E. coli Trx have an identical 164° χ angle. In all compared redoxins, the bond angles of the second active site cysteine are more similar to each other than the bond angles of the first cysteine (Table IV). We find no obvious correlation between the conformational angles of the first cysteine and the reduction potential. T4 Grx with E°′= −240 mV has the most similar reduction potential to NrdH (E°′= −248.5 mV), but differs most in the active site cysteine angles. However, T4 Grx, like NrdH, has a valine adjacent to the first cysteine residue in the CXXC motif. This is consistent with observations that the residues between the two active site cysteines are important determinants of the redox potential (41Mössner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Rietsch A.

Open table in a new tab Whereas the first cysteine of the active site, Cys11, is surface accessible, Cys14 lies in a groove formed by the residues Arg8, Cys11, and Gln13. NrdH has a deep hydrophobic pocket next to the active site; Val54 and Ile55 form the bottom of this cavity, surrounded by the hydrophobic residues Val33, Leu43, Phe48, and Tyr6 (Fig.5). At the rim of the hydrophobic pocket, three arginine residues, Arg8, Arg44, and Arg49, form a positively charged surface around the cleft. A pocket with similar location and width is also found in Trx, formed by Phe12, Phe27, Phe81, and Leu58 (Fig. 5). The hydrophobic pocket of Trx is not surrounded by as many positively charged residues as observed in NrdH, only one positively charged surface residue, Arg73, is structurally conserved and aligns to Arg49 in NrdH. Instead of a hydrophobic pocket, Grx has a narrow groove where GSH is binding. Tyr13, Thr50, Thr51, Val52, and Arg40 form the walls of a bent cleft, which contains the glutathione binding site (42Nordstrand K. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Otting G. Berndt K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 43Bushweller J.H Billetter M. Holmgren A. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1585-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As in the hydrophobic pocket of NrdH, arginines, Arg16, Arg40, and Arg49 (Fig. 5) surround the channel. In NrdH, side chains block part of this cleft, in particular by Gln50. Residues interacting with glutathione in Grx are in general not conserved in NrdH (Fig. 4 a). Superposition of NrdH on E. coli Trx in the Trx-TrxR complex (24Lennon B.W. Williams Jr., C.H. Ludwig M.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1190-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) gives a model that shows only few steric clashes between the two molecules. These occur in the area of the loop that connects helix α2 and strand β3 in NrdH, and are because of the longer helix α2 in NrdH compared with Trx. However, a small rotation of NrdH will dock this loop in a groove on TrxR and at the same time allow interaction of TrxR with the hydrophobic pocket in NrdH, analogous to the Trx-TrxR interaction (Fig.6). Phe141 and Phe142 of TrxR fit very well into this hydrophobic pocket. The distance between Cys11 of NrdH and Cys138of TrxR in this docking model is 4.3 Å but as in the Trx-TrxR complex, the loop containing Cys11 could bend toward TrxR, enabling the cysteine residues to form a disulfide bond. Structural analysis of NrdH has shown that it lacks the glutathione binding site seen in the glutaredoxins. The architecture of the surface, which in glutaredoxins defines the binding site of GSH, is completely different, and residues interacting with the electron donor are also not conserved between the two subfamilies of redoxins. NrdH is thus unable to accept GSH as a substrate. The interaction of thioredoxin with thioredoxin reductase is characterized by three major features: (i) the docking of two phenylalanine residues from TrxR into a hydrophobic pocket of Trx close to the redox active cysteine, (ii) binding of the loop between helix α2 and strand β3 (nomenclature according to Fig. 4) of Trx into a groove on the surface of TrxR and (iii) interaction of the redox active cysteines enabling transfer of reducing equivalents (24Lennon B.W. Williams Jr., C.H. Ludwig M.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1190-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A striking observation is the presence in NrdH of a large hydrophobic pocket, at the same position as the corresponding pocket in Trx. Modeling experiments showed that it is possible to dock NrdH onto TrxR in a very similar way as observed in the TrxR-Trx complex (24Lennon B.W. Williams Jr., C.H. Ludwig M.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1190-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), with the essential features of redoxin-reductase interactions preserved. It thus appears that the architecture of the hydrophobic pocket and the protruding loop, formed mainly by residues 43–55 at the surface of NrdH, are the major determinants of the substrate specificity of this protein and at least in part define the thioredoxin-like activity profile. NrdH is part of the NrdHIEF operon, where NrdEFcodes for a class Ib ribonucleotide reductase (9Jordan A. Pontis E. Åslund F. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8779-8785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The NrdEFgenes appear not to be expressed under standard growth conditions (44Jordan A. Pontis E. Atta M. Krook M. Gibert I. Barbé J. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12892-12896Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, recent results show that basal transcript levels of theNrdHIEF mRNA are strongly enhanced depending on growth medium and phase (12Monje-Casas F. Jurado J. Prieto-Amamo M.-J. Holmgren A. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18031-18037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, addition of oxidants also results in strong up-regulation of NrdHIEF transcription suggesting functions under stress conditions. NrdH is a better hydrogen donor for the NrdEF ribonucleotide reductase than for the NrdAB enzyme. The class Ib RNR is efficient at low oxygen levels (9Jordan A. Pontis E. Åslund F. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8779-8785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and it has been suggested that this additional aerobic enzyme could function when the oxygen availability is too low to activate class Ia but high enough to inactivate class III (11Torrents E. Jordan A. Karlsson M. Gibert I. Curr. Microbiol. 2000; 41: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Under microaerophilic conditions most of GSH is conjugated with spermidine (45Smith K. Borges A. Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and not available for the cell. NrdH lacks a glutathione binding site and instead has a hydrophobic pocket to bind TrxR and can thus function independent of the cellular glutathione status. Thus, under these conditions, type Ib RNR in combination with NrdH is a much more efficient enzyme than type Ia RNR (NrdAB). The NrdEF- NrdH system may therefore be the evolutionary oldest RNR reducing system, capable of functioning in a microaerophilic environment, where glutathione was not yet available. Given this scenario, it has been proposed that NrdH and similar redox proteins may be related to the progenitor of the thioredoxin family (10Jordan A. Åslund F. Pontis E. Reichard P. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18044-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Grx and NrdH proteins are among the structurally simplest members of the Trx superfamily, in fact the common fold motif is a NrdH-redoxin or glutaredoxin rather than a thioredoxin fold. Both in a structural and functional sense, NrdH can be described as a hybrid between the thioredoxins and glutaredoxins and it is conceivable that other members of this family emerged by divergent evolution from a NrdH-like ancestor.

https://openalex.org/W1980504189,"The erythropoietin (Epo) receptor transduces its signals by activating physically associated tyrosine kinases, mainly Jak2 and Lyn, and thereby inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of various substrates including the Epo receptor (EpoR) itself. We previously demonstrated that, in Epo-stimulated cells, an adapter protein, CrkL, becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated, physically associates with Shc, SHP-2, and Cbl, and plays a role in activation of the Ras/Erk signaling pathway. Here, we demonstrate that Epo induces binding of CrkL to the tyrosine-phosphorylated EpoR and SHIP1 in 32D/EpoR-Wt cells overexpressing CrkL. In vitro binding studies showed that the CrkL SH2 domain directly mediates the EpoR binding, which was specifically inhibited by a synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to the amino acid sequences at Tyr460 in the cytoplasmic domain of EpoR. The CrkL SH2 domain was also required for tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL in Epo-stimulated cells. Overexpression of Lyn induced constitutive phosphorylation of CrkL and activation of Erk, whereas that of a Lyn mutant lacking the tyrosine kinase domain attenuated the Epo-induced phosphorylation of CrkL and activation of Erk. Furthermore, Lyn, but not Jak2, phosphorylated CrkL on tyrosine in in vitro kinase assays. Together, the present study suggests that, upon Epo stimulation, CrkL is recruited to the EpoR through interaction between the CrkL SH2 domain and phosphorylated Tyr460 in the EpoR cytoplasmic domain and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by receptor-associated Lyn to activate the downstream signaling pathway leading to the activation of Erk and Elk-1."
https://openalex.org/W2059247897,"Nicotinate mononucleotide (NaMN):5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase (CobT) from Salmonella enterica plays a central role in the synthesis of α-ribazole, a key component of the lower ligand of cobalamin. Surprisingly, CobT can phosphoribosylate a wide range of aromatic substrates, giving rise to a wide variety of lower ligands in cobamides. To understand the molecular basis for this lack of substrate specificity, the x-ray structures of CobT complexed with adenine, 5-methylbenzimidazole, 5-methoxybenzimidazole, p-cresol, and phenol were determined. Furthermore, adenine, 5-methylbenzimidazole, 5-methoxybenzimidazole, and 2-hydroxypurine were observed to react with NaMN within the crystal lattice and undergo the phosphoribosyl transfer reaction to form product. Significantly, the stereochemistries of all products are identical to those found in vivo. Interestingly, p-cresol and phenol, which are the lower ligand in Sporomusa ovata, bound to CobT but did not react with NaMN. This study provides a structural explanation for how CobT can phosphoribosylate most of the commonly observed lower ligands found in cobamides with the exception of the phenolic lower ligands observed in S. ovata. This is accomplished with minor conformational changes in the side chains that constitute the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole binding site.

These investigations are consistent with the implication that the nature of the lower ligand is controlled by metabolic factors rather by the specificity of the phosphoribosyltransferase. 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole nicotinate mononucleotide Cobalamin is the largest and most complex cofactor found in biological systems (Fig. 1). It consists of a corrin ring, which provides four of the ligands to the central cobalt ion, together with an upper and lower ligand that complete the coordination sphere. In its biologically functional form, the upper ligand of the coenzyme is an adenosyl group that is covalently attached to the cobalt. This labile bond cobalt-carbon is the source of the unusual chemistry facilitated by cobamides. In contrast to the upper ligand, the lower ligand shows considerable variation (3Rondon M.R. Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The range of lower ligands that have been observed is extensive and depends on the nature of the microorganism (TableI). The list includes 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB),15-methylbenzimidazole, 5-methoxybenzimidazole, 5-hydroxybenzimidazole, 5-methoxy-6-methylbenzimidazole, adenine, 2-methylsulfinyladenine, 2-methylsulfonyladenine, p-cresol, and phenol (3Rondon M.R.

Biochem. 1987; 163: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Of these, 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole is the most commonly observed base of the lower ligand and is utilized by organisms such as Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas denitrificans. These ligands fall into two groups depending on whether a carbon-nitrogen or carbon-oxygen bond is formed to the ribose.Table ILower ligands investigated in this study Open table in a new tab The enormous variation in the lower ligand, even within a single organism, presents a biochemical problem of how the variability of this essential component of the cofactor is accommodated by cobamide-dependent enzymes. Structural studies on both methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase have shown that the lower ligand of cobalamin is replaced by a histidine side chain (5Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 6Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bösecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). As a consequence, a wide variety of lower ligands could be accommodated by these enzymes. Interestingly, in diol dehydratase, the lower ligand remains coordinated to the corrinoid (7Shibata N. Masuda J. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. Suto K. Morimoto Y. Yasuoka N. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (218) Google Scholar), which implies that this enzyme should be more selective for its cofactor, as is observed (8Ishida A. Ichikawa M. Kobayashi K. Hitomi T. Kojima S. Toraya T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 1993; 39: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,9Toraya T. Miyoshi S. Mori M. Wada K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A related question to how enzymes can utilize a range of lower ligands is how the enzymes responsible for cobamide biosynthesis are able to accommodate such a wide range of ligands. Much less is known about how the intermediates in cobamide biosynthesis are recognized, although considerable effort has been made to understand the biosynthesis of cobalamin (10Blanche F. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Debussche L. Thibaut D. Vuilhorgne M. Leeper F.J. Battersby A.R. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 383-411Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Scott A.I. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1993; 32: 1223-1243Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Twenty-four genes have been identified to be directly involved in the construction of this cofactor (12Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Bobik T.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 137-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Of these,cobC, cobS, cobT, and cobUin S. enterica are required for synthesis of the lower ligand and assembly of the nucleotide loop (Fig.2). CobU (adenosylcobinamide kinase/adenosylcobinamide phosphate guanylyltransferase) is the central enzyme in the biosynthesis of the nucleotide loop and functions to activate adenosylcobinamide by the attachment of guanosine diphosphate to form adenosylcobinamide-GDP (13Thomas M.G. Thompson T.B. Rayment I. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27576-27586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Thompson T.B. Thomas M.G.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12995-13005Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). CobS (cobalamin synthase) is the final enzyme in cobalamin biosynthesis and combines the activated cobinamide or adenosylcobinamide-GDP and ribosylated lower ligand to form the end product, adenosylcobalamin (16Maggio-Hall L.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11798-11803Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). CobT (dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase) and CobC work sequentially to couple the lower ligand to a ribosyl moiety. In S. enterica, the lower ligand of cobalamin is 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole when the organism is grown under aerobic conditions (17Johnson M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13302-13305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, under anaerobic conditions adenine replaces DMB (18Keck B. Renz P. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 76-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The transfer reaction in both cases is carried out by CobT (Scheme FS1). This enzyme has been shown to be able to phosphoribosylate (in vitro) a variety of other bases, including benzimidazole, imidazole, histidine, and guanine (19Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17662-17667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence that broad specificity is a common feature of CobT homologues, since several organisms, includingEscherichia coli, will incorporate a variety of exogenous bases into functional corrinoids in vivo (20Perlman D. Barrett J.M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1958; 4: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of CobT from S. entericahas been determined complexed with 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole and its reaction products nicotinic acid and α-ribazole-5′-phosphate (21Cheong C.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16125-16135Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This revealed that NaMN:DMB phosphoribosyltransferase is a molecular dimer, where each subunit consists of a large and a small domain (Fig. 3). The large domain exhibits a Rossmann fold that is characterized by a parallel six-stranded β-sheet with connecting α-helices. The small domain is made from components of the N- and C-terminal sections of the polypeptide chain and contains a three-helix bundle. As expected, the active site lies at the C-terminal end of the β-strands of the Rossmann fold, which is responsible for coordinating the ribonucleotide, although the orientation of the substrate is opposite to that seen in other nucleotide dependent enzymes. The small domains from both subunits contribute to each DMB binding site of the dimer to create a hydrophobic pocket, which accounts for the coordination of nonpolar substrates. At the time of the original structure determination, it was unclear how the DMB binding pocket could accommodate polar ligands such as adenine. The variability in the lower ligands found in natural cobamides raises an interesting question of how these diverse bases are recognized by CobT homologues in these microorganisms, how an organism chooses its lower ligand, and how these variants of cobalamin are utilized by enzymes that are dependent on this cofactor. To provide an insight into these questions, a structural study of the interaction between CobT from S. enterica and all of the commonly observed lower ligands has been undertaken. We report here the structures of CobT complexed with adenine, 5-methylbenzimidazole, 5-methoxybenzimidazole,p-cresol, and phenol. In addition, adenine, 5-methylbenzimidazole, 5-methoxybenzimidazole, and 2-hydroxypurine were observed to react with NaMN within the crystal lattice and undergo the phosphoribosyl transfer reaction to form product. Interestingly,p-cresol and phenol did not react with NaMN. These studies provide an insight into the broad specificity of this enzyme. In addition, they also suggest differences that must be present in CobT homologs where the substrate specificity is radically different from that of S. enterica. The wide variability of ligands utilized by CobT suggests that the choice of lower ligand by an organism is dictated by earlier enzymatic or metabolic steps that control the nature of the nitrogenous base available to this phosphoribosyltransferase. CobT was overexpressed and purified as described before (19Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17662-17667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Cheong C.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16125-16135Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All purification procedures and manipulation of the protein were carried out at 4 °C. The purified protein was concentrated in a Centriprep-30 concentrator and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl. The protein was flash-frozen by dropping 32-μl aliquots into liquid nitrogen that were then stored at −80 °C. Crystals of apo-CobT employed for this structural investigation were grown with the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. Equal volumes of protein at 6 mg/ml protein in its final storage buffer and a precipitant containing 1.4 mNH4H2PO4/(NH4)2HPO4at pH 6.0 were mixed and suspended over the precipitant solution at room temperature. Crystals grew spontaneously and achieved sizes of 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.2 mm in 2 weeks. The crystals belong to the space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions of a = 72.1 Å, b = 90.2 Å, and c = 47.5 Å. Prior to preparation of the ligand complexes, the crystals of apo-CobT were transferred to 1.4 mNH4H2PO4/(NH4)2HPO4, pH 6.0, in which they were indefinitely stable. All of the lower ligands and NaMN were dissolved in this storage solution. Crystals were first transferred to a solution of a lower ligand, and then after 24 h or more a 100 mm NaMN solution was added to a final concentration of 10 mm to observe if the phosphoribosyl transfer might occur within the crystal lattice.

Open table in a new tab This study of the interaction between CobT and the wide variety of bases that are found as lower ligands in cobamides was facilitated by the ability of crystals of apo-CobT to accept the aromatic bases without destruction of the crystal lattice or induction of a large conformational change in the protein structure. More importantly, the crystal lattice also allows the protein to undergo phosphoribosyl transfer to the base when the second substrate NaMN is diffused into the crystals after the base is bound within the active site. The high resolution data recorded from these complexes are sufficient to identify the orientation of the bound ligand and the stereochemistry of the product. Interestingly, in the absence of the aromatic base, crystals soaked in NaMN always exhibit nicotinate and phosphate within the active site rather than the mononucleotide. Adenine is the lower ligand of cobamides inPropionibacterium arabinosum, Propionigenium modestum, Clostridium tetanomorphum,Methanoplanus limicola, and all methanoccales (20Perlman D. Barrett J.M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1958; 4: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Stupperich E. Eisinger H.J. Adv. Space Res. 1989; 9: 117-125Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 28Barker H.A.

Microbiol. 1988; 149: 268-271Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is also the ligand utilized by S. enterica when grown under anaerobic conditions (18Keck B. Renz P. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 76-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Transfer of a crystal of CobT to a solution that contains adenine reveals that this ligand is readily accepted by the active site (Fig.4A) and binds in a very similar position to that of DMB (Fig.5A). As noted previously, the DMB binding pocket is very hydrophobic and is built from components of both subunits (21Cheong C.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16125-16135Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This included Met177, Vall84, Leu315, and Pro32′, Leu30′, Leu341′, Ile346′, and Leu348′ from the symmetry-related subunit. Thus, it might be surprising that CobT can utilize a polar substrate such as adenine. The major difference between the binding of adenine and that of DMB in CobT active site is that side-chain oxygen of Ser80hydrogen-bonds to N-10 of adenine and that side-chain amide nitrogen atom of Gln88 hydrogen-bonds to the N-3 atom of adenine. In the complex with DMB, Ser80 and Gln88 are rotated slightly away from DMB to fulfill their hydrogen bonding capabilities, whereas with adenine they move to accommodate its polar nature. Interestingly, the hydrogen-bonding network associated with Gln88 would conflict with the alternative orientation of adenine that would place N-10 (of adenine) in close proximity with Gln88.Figure 5Close-up stereoviews of the DMB binding pocket in CobT showing the hydrophobic components that form the binding site.

This demonstrates that the aromatic moieties of each product adopt very similar locations in the binding pocket, even when they differ considerably in their polarity. The coordinates for the complex with α-ribazole correspond to Protein Data Bank accession number 1D0V. The molecules were superimposed with the program ALIGN (24Cohen G.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1160-1161Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar), modified at the University of Wisconsin by Dr. Gary Wesenberg to allow selection of the segments used for the alignment (available on request).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies have shown that CobT can utilize adenine in vitro (19Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17662-17667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To examine whether adenine would react with NaMN within the crystal lattice, as was observed for DMB and NaMN (21Cheong C.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16125-16135Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a crystal was transferred first to adenine and then to a solution that contained NaMN. A difference Fourier map calculated at 2.1-Å resolution after one cycle of refinement revealed that the two products (nicotinate and α-adenosine monophosphate) were bound in the CobT active site (Fig. 4B). The stereochemistry of the ribonucleotide product is same as that found in the naturally occurring α-adenosine monophosphate-containing cobamides, whereby the amino group of adenine is pointing toward the ribose moiety rather than away from it (Fig. 5B). As noted above, this arises from the polarity of the DMB binding pocket. The observed orientation of adenine is favored by the hydrogen bond between amide nitrogen atom of Gln88 and the N-3 atom of adenine together with the hydrogen bond between the side-chain oxygen of Ser80 and N-10 of adenine (Fig. 5A). The alternative orientation for adenine would place N-10 of adenine too close to the side chain for Gln88. This interaction excludes the alternative product. This suggests that CobT of S. enterica binds adenine with the same stereochemistry as its homologues in the organisms listed above that utilize this base. 5-Methylbenzimidazole is the lower ligand in microorganisms such as Desulfobulbus autotrophicum, Desulfobulbus propionicus, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus(30Krautler B. Kohler H.P. Stupperich E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Crystals soaked in 1.9 mm 5-methylbenzimidazole show unambiguous electron density for this ligand (Fig. 4C). The mode of binding is very similar to that of DMB. Transfer of a crystal first to 5-methylbenzimidazole and then to NaMN shows that the phosphoribosyl transfer reaction will also occur within the crystal lattice (Fig. 4D). Unequivocal density forN1-(5-phospho-α-ribosyl)-5-methylbenzimidazole is present within the active site. In principle, two products could arise from the transfer of methylbenzimidazole to the phosphoribose, yielding either 5- or 6-methylbenzimidazole, depending on the orientation of the benzimidazole moiety in the active site. Significantly, the 5-methyl-substituted product is generated in the crystal lattice as seen in natural cobamides (30Krautler B. Kohler H.P. Stupperich E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This suggests that the substrate binding pocket has a higher affinity for the methyl group in the 5-position than in the rotated position that would yield the 6-methyl product. The physical basis of this preference is evident from the structure. Although the DMB binding pocket is highly hydrophobic, the inclusion of Ser80 at the periphery of the enclosure makes one side of the pocket somewhat more polar. As a consequence, the 5-methyl group lies away from the Ser80 in such a way that it optimizes the nonpolar interactions. Interestingly alignment of 12 orthologous enzymes from a variety of bacteria (data not shown) reveals that the equivalent residue is mostly serine or tyrosine, although occasionally an alanine. This suggests that a large number of bacteria should be able to incorporate adenine into the position of the lower ligand for cobalamin. 5-Methoxybenzimidazole is the lower ligand found in cobamides isolated from Clostridium thermoaceticum (31Irion E. Ljungdahl L. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 2780-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Crystals soaked in 13 mm5-methoxybenzimidazole showed unequivocal electron density for 5-methoxybenzimidazole in the active site (Fig. 4E). As anticipated from the structure of 5-methylbenzimidazole, the methoxy group points into the 5-methyl binding pocket. Interestingly, there is no apparent accommodation of the lone pair on the methoxy group; however, there is ample room adjacent to the oxygen for transitory water molecules. Transfer of crystals soaked in 5-methoxybenzimidazole to 10 mm NaMN demonstrated that the phosphoribosyltransferase reaction also occurs within the crystal lattice for this substrate (Fig. 4F). Unambiguous density forN1-(5-phospho-α-ribosyl)-5-methoxybenzimidazole is present within the active site. The reaction product has the same orientation of the methoxy group (in the 5- as opposed to the 6-position) as that generated by the CobT homolog present in C. thermoaceticum (31Irion E. Ljungdahl L. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 2780-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 5-Hydroxybenzimidazole is the lower ligand of cobamides in organisms such as Pelobacter propionicus, all methanobacteriales tested, Methanolobus tindarius,Methanogenium marisnigri, and Methanospirillum hungaritii (27Stupperich E. Eisinger H.J. Adv. Space Res. 1989; 9: 117-125Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 29Stupperich E. Krautler B. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 149: 268-271Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Krautler B. Moll J. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Since this lower ligand is not readily available, 2-hydroxypurine was chosen as an analog of this compound. Crystals of CobT were soaked for 24 h in 10 mm2-hydroxypurine and then transferred to 10 mm NaMN. These crystals show clear density for the reaction product in the active site (Fig. 6A). At the initial stages of the refinement, the orientation of the base in the active site was unclear; however, the final omit map after the addition of water molecules and subsequent refinement revealed that the hydroxyl group is oriented toward the 5-methyl binding pocket. Interestingly, in contrast to all other complexes, residues Ser344, Asn345, Val347, Leu348, and Pro349 are disordered in the phosphoribosyl-2-hydroxypurine complex. These residues are located in the C-terminal loop and are involved in binding of DMB. This suggests that the presence of the polar hydroxyl group of 2-hydroxypurine induces disorder into this region of the molecule. As with adenine, the side-chain amide nitrogen atom of Gln88 hydrogen-bonds to the N-3 atom of the 2-hydroxypurine. Otherwise, there are few specific interactions with the polar components of the substrate. The orientation of 2-hydroxypurine is consistent with that found in cobamides that utilize 5-hydroxybenzimidazole as their lower ligands. However, it is clear from the disorder observed in the complex of 2-hydroxypurine that this is not the best ligand for CobT from S. enterica. Thus, it is anticipated that the organisms that utilize 5-hydroxybenzimidazole as their lower ligands will include residues in their active sites that specifically distinguish the position of the hydroxyl group. Unfortunately, although the genomic sequences of several methanogens are known, the sequence similarities between CobT and the suggested orthologs inMethanothermobactor thermautotrophicus andMethanococcus jannaschii are so low that it is difficult to identify the equivalent residues in the active site. 3Nicotinate mononucleotide:5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase has been assigned to COG2038 (cluster of orthologous groups) 2038 and belongs to group H (proteins involved in coenzyme transport and metabolism) (1Tatusov R.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (3035) Google Scholar). The clustal alignment of >15 proteins that are proposed to be orthologous to CobT can be on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/COG/palox?COG2038. This list includes the sequence for CobT from A. fulgidus, E. coli, M. thermoautotrophicum, and M. jannaschii. There is very limited sequence similarity between CobT from S. entericaand the methanogens. Furthermore, the sequence alignment is unedited and thus cannot be taken as proof of the presence or absence of active-site residues. p-Cresol and phenol are the lower ligands in cobamides isolated from Sporomusa ovata(33Stupperich E. Eisinger H.J. Krautler B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and represent the most divergent of all ligands observed in cobamides. In order to examine whether CobT is able to facilitate ribosyl transfer to a phenol moiety, crystals of CobT were soaked for 24 h in 10 mm p-cresol or 10 mmphenol. Subsequent data collection and structural analysis revealed that both of these ligands bind in the active site (Fig. 6,B and D) in approximately the same location as that of DMB (Fig. 7). In these complexes, the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group of p-cresol and phenol form a hydrogen bond to O-ε2 of Glu317 with a bond-distance of 2.6 and 3.0 Å, respectively. Crystals soaked in p-cresol or phenol were transferred into corresponding solutions that also contained 10 mm NaMN. Difference Fouriers and refinement of the corresponding structures reveal that active sites still contain p-cresol or phenol together with nicotinate and phosphate (Fig. 6, C andE) where the nicotinate arises as an adventitious hydrolysis product of NaMN. This demonstrates that, at least within the crystal lattice, CobT is unable to transfer a phosphoribosyl moiety to a phenolic oxygen. Interestingly, the substrate NaMN is not observed in the crystal lattice when crystals of CobT are soaked in NaMN either in the absence of the second substrate 4C.-G. Cheong and I. Rayment, unpublished results. or in the presence of these phenolic substrates. Rather, nicotinate is observed together with a phosphate ion. In the complexes with these phenolic substrates, the hydroxyl groups ofp-cresol and phenol remain coordinated to O-ε2 of Glu317. As such, this interaction positions the hydroxyl group at a considerable distance from the anticipated position of the C-1 carbon of ribose as deduced by overlaying the structures of α-ribazole-5′-phosphate complex on the structures with phenol orp-cresol. Indeed, the distance between the C-1 carbon of the ribose ring of α-ribazole-5′-phosphate and the hydroxyl oxygen ofp-cresol is 4.0 Å when these structures are superimposed. This distance seems to be too long for the reaction to occur. In the complex of phenol and nicotinate, the aromatic ring is somewhat displaced from its position in the binary complex (Fig. 6, Dand E) such that it hydrogen-bonds not only to O-ε2 of Glu317 but also to N-ε2 of Gln88 and further displaces the phenolic oxygen from the expected position of the ribose C-1 carbon. This further suggests that the active site of CobT is too large for transfer of these substrates and implies that the CobT homolog in S. ovata must have a different active site that serves to bring the two substrates in closer proximity than observed in CobT. In addition, it may require catalytic residues to deprotonate and activate the hydroxyl group of p-cresol or phenol that do not appear to be required for phosphoribosyl transfer to an aromatic nitrogenous base. This study provides a structural explanation of why CobT from S. enterica will phosphoribosylate all of the aromatic nitrogenous bases commonly found in corrinoids from a very wide range of bacteria and archaea. Furthermore, in all cases, the stereochemistries of the products generated by CobT are identical to those found in vivo (Fig. 5B). This is surprising, since the polarity of the bases varies considerably from dimethylbenzimidazole to adenine. Examination of the structures reveals that the active site of CobT can accommodate DMB or adenine equally well with only minor changes in the orientation of the side chains to facilitate presentation of a hydrophobic surface to DMB or form compensatory hydrogen bonds to the polar components of adenine. In addition, the binding site contains a distinct hydrophobic polarity that selects for the 5-substituted benzimidazoles in those cases where a choice would otherwise result in the substituent in either the 5- or 6-positions. This arises because the binding site consists of a deep but narrow pocket lined with hydrophobic residues coupled with a hydrophilic lining to the opening to the solvent (Ser80). As a consequence, the aromatic moieties of the products adopt remarkably similar locations in the active site (Fig. 5B). These structural observations account for the ability of S. enterica to incorporate either DMB or adenine as the lower ligand for cobalamin, depending on the environmental conditions. The ability of CobT to utilize alternative bases as demonstrated in earlier biochemical studies (19Trzebiatowski J.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17662-17667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and explained here demands that the choice of lower ligand utilized by an organism is determined by metabolic conditions or as yet undetermined biochemical pathways that generate the nitrogenous bases. Indeed, the broad specificity of the phosphoribosyltransferase activity was noted many years ago when it was shown that several organisms, including E. coli, will incorporate a variety of exogenous bases into functional corrinoidsin vivo. This suggests that broad specificity is a common feature of CobT homologs (20Perlman D. Barrett J.M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1958; 4: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)."

In an earlier study, we reported that the introduction of the β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT) III gene into swine endothelial cells resulted in a substantial reduction in the expression of the α-Gal epitope. In this study, we report on the mechanism for this down-regulation of the α-Gal epitope by means of structural and kinetic analyses. The structural analyses revealed that the amount of N-linked oligosaccharides bearing the α-Gal epitopes in the GnT-III-transfected cells was less than 10% that in parental cells, due to the alteration of the terminal structures as well as a decrease in branch formation. In addition, it appeared that the addition of a bisecting GlcNAc, which is catalyzed by GnT-III, leads to a more efficient sialylation rather than α-galactosylation. In vitro kinetic analyses showed that the bisecting GlcNAc has an inhibitory effect on α-galactosylation, but does not significantly affect the sialylation. These results suggest that the bisecting GlcNAc in the core is capable of modifying the biosynthesis of the terminal structures via its differential effects on the capping glycosyltransferase reactions.

The elimination of this antigen from pig tissues is highly desirable because it would prevent this type of rejection (1Joziasse D.H. Oriol R. Biochim. Biophys.

Since the α-Gal epitope is synthesized by UDP-Gal:β-d-Gal α-1,3-galactosyltransferase (α1,3-GT), inactivation of the α1,3-GT gene represents the most promising strategy for the elimination of α-Gal epitopes. However, pigs that lack the α-Gal epitope have not yet been established. Alternatively, an alternate strategy is the overexpression of a glycosyltransferase such as GDP-Fuc:β-d-Gal α-1,2-fucosyltransferase (α1,2-FT), CMP-sialic acid:β-d-Gal α-2,3-sialyltransferase (α2,3-ST), and CMP-sialic acid:β-d-Gal α-2,6-sialyltransferase (α2,6-ST), all of which would be expected to compete with α1,3-GT for a common substrate, N-acetyllactosamine structure. In fact, such an enzymatic competition was successful in reducing the α-Gal epitope, to some extent, as reported previously (4Sandrin M.S. Fodor W.L. Mouhtouris E. Osman N. Cohney S. Rollins S.A.

In the SEC transfected with the GnT-III gene, the antigenicity to normal human serum and cell lysis mediated by normal human serum was reduced considerably. Although this strategy is distinct from enzymatic competition with α1,3-GT, these levels of reduction were found to be comparable in the case of transfection with a competitive glycosyltransferase, α1,2-FT gene (11Tanemura M. Miyagawa S. Ihara Y. Matsuda H. Shirakura R. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since GnT-III catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc to a core β-mannose, producing a bisecting GlcNAc, and is one of the glycosyltransferases that act on the core region ofN-glycans, this reduction by GnT-III is not dependent on competition with α1,3-GT. It is well known that the prior addition of a bisecting GlcNAc by GnT-III inhibits further branch formation by UDP-GlcNAc:α-1,3-d-Man β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase IV and UDP-GlcNAc:α-1,6-d-Man β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) and leads to a decrease in branching structure (14Schachter H.

Since the α-galactosyl residues can be potentially transferred to all branches inN-glycans, the decrease in branching, as the result of the introduction of the GnT-III gene, might result in a decreased number of α-Gal epitopes. Nevertheless, the reduction of xenoantigenicity, as was found in the GnT-III-transfected SEC used in our previous study (7Miyagawa S. Tanemura M. Koyota S. Koma M. Ikeda Y. Shirakura R. Taniguchi N.

This has prompted us to investigate the structural basis of the reduction of α-Gal epitopes in GnT-III-transfected SEC.The effects of the bisecting GlcNAc on the actions of several glycosyltransferases and α-mannosidase have been studied on a case by case basis using in vitro activity assays that are based on substrate specificity (17Harpaz N.

However, an actual role(s) of the bisecting GlcNAc in the regulation ofN-glycan biosynthesis has not fully been demonstratedin vivo because of the lack of a comprehensive structural analysis of the cellular oligosaccharides. Such a study in which total oligosaccharides from the GnT-III transfected cells are analyzed and compared with those from the parental cells would allow us to elucidate clearly the regulation of N-glycan biosynthetic pathway by GnT-III in the cells. This would be useful in terms of understanding the mechanism for the GnT-III-conducted down-regulation of the α-Gal epitope more clearly and, thereby, would contribute to the development of an enzymatic remodeling based strategy, aimed at attempting to overcome the α-Gal epitope-mediated hyperacute rejection.In this study, we prepared free oligosaccharides that were labeled with a fluorescent reagent, 2-aminopyridine, from the transfected SEC overexpressing GnT-III, and we analyzed their structures. A comparison of these structures with those from normal SEC permitted us to estimate quantitatively the magnitude of the reduction of the α-Gal epitopes and to analyze alterations in the terminal sequences, as well as the core structures. Furthermore, detailed kinetic studies involving α1,3-GT and ST were carried out in order to examine the effect of the bisecting GlcNAc on the susceptibilities of the substrates to these capping reactions. The results suggest that GnT-III also regulates the biosynthesis of the terminal structure via the addition of the bisecting GlcNAc even though the enzyme is involved in the formation of only the core structure.RESULTSA lectin blot analysis, using G. simplicifolia IB4 isolectin (IB4), was carried out in order to compare the levels of an α-Gal epitope in normal SEC and GnT-III-transfected SEC. As shown in Fig. 1, normal SEC express a high level of the α-Gal epitope, and this level is comparable to that in the α1,3-GT-transfected COS cells, or even higher. On the other hand, nearly no detectable α-Gal epitope was observed in the GnT-III-transfected SEC, as indicated by comparison with COS cells, which are defective in expression and activity of α1,3-GT, as an α-Gal epitope-negative control. These results indicate that transfection with the GnT-III strongly down-regulates the expression of the α-Gal epitope on glycoproteins in SEC and accounts for the substantial reduction in their xenoantigenicity, as has been reported in our previous studies (7Miyagawa S.

Thus, the structures of the totalN-glycans in GnT-III-transfected SEC were analyzed and compared with those in normal SEC. Total N-glycans were prepared by hydrazinolysis of whole cell lysates, followed by re-N-acetylation and fluorescence labeling with 2-aminopyridine. These PA-oligosaccharides were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 2). The elution profile of the transfected SEC was different from the profile of the normal SEC, indicating that the oligosaccharide structures in SEC had been totally altered as the result of GnT-III transfection.Figure 2HPLC profiles of PA-oligosaccharides from normal and GnT-III-transfected SEC. N-Linked oligosaccharides in normal and GnT-III-transfected SEC were liberated by hydrazinolysis followed by re-N-acetylation, and the reducing ends of the oligosaccharides were labeled with 2-aminopyridine (PA). PA-oligosaccharides from normal SEC (A) and GnT-III-transfected SEC (B) were subjected to HPLC analysis without glycosidase digestion. Profiles of the α-galactosidase-digested PA-oligosaccharides are shown inC for normal cells and in D for transfected cells. Details of the experimental conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” bi andbi(F) represent biantennary oligosaccharide and biantennary oligosaccharide with a fucose residue at the core GlcNAc, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When the PA-oligosaccharides were digested by α-galactosidase, three major peaks were observed in the profile of the normal SEC, all of which were α-galactosylated (Fig. 2). These peaks were collected and analyzed by glycosidase digestion followed by reversed phase HPLC and mass spectrometry, and as a result, two of these three peaks were identified as core α1,6-fucosylated and non-fucosylated digalacto-biantennary oligosaccharides. In the case of the transfected SEC, on the other hand, α-galactosidase digestion resulted in essentially no change in the elution profile. Consistent with the results from the lectin blot analysis, this suggests that a substantial fraction of N-glycans in the normal cells contain α-Gal epitopes, whereas most of N-glycans in the transfected cells do not. Thus, the results further confirm that a dramatic reduction in the α-Gal epitope by the expression of GnT-III had occurred.To assess the changes in the core structure by GnT-III, PA-oligosaccharides from normal and GnT-III-transfected SEC were exhaustively digested with a complete mixture of glycosidases, which contained sialidase, α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase, and α-fucosidase, followed by analysis using reversed phase HPLC (Fig.3). The elution profile for the normal SEC showed four major peaks that corresponded to PA-agalacto-bi-, -tri-, -tri′-, and -tetraantennary oligosaccharides, indicating that the SEC are capable of producing N-glycans with a variety of branches. In contrast, only one major peak was found in the transfected cells, which was identified as the PA-agalacto-bisected biantennary oligosaccharide. This indicates that the biosynthesis of multiantennary oligosaccharides is inhibited, in the case of the GnT-III-transfected SEC. This inhibition by GnT-III appears to constitute a mechanism for reducing the α-Gal epitopes in the cells, since it leads to a decrease in number of potential sites for α-galactosylation.Figure 3Analyses of terminal structures of the PA-oligosaccharides from normal and GnT-III-transfected SEC by differential glycosidase digestion.

Left and right panels show the profiles for normal and transfected cells, respectively. Details of the experimental conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since polylactosamines are absent in N-glycans from both normal and transfected SEC, as indicated by the analysis with endo-β-galactosidase (data not shown), most of the complex typeN-glycans were digested into the corresponding core structures by the complete glycosidase mixture. When α-galactosidase was omitted from the mixture, α-galactosylated oligosaccharides were not converted to the core structures that had already been identified. Therefore, a variation in the peak area for each core structure between the cases in the absence and presence of α-galactosidase should represent the oligosaccharide fraction that contained at least one α-galactosyl residue. This permitted the content of the oligosaccharide that contained one or more α-galactosyl residue to be estimated separately for each of bi-, tri-, tri′-, and tetraantennae. As shown by a comparison of the profiles obtained in the absence and presence of α-galactosidase, it was found that a large portion of any of the bi-, tri-, tri′-, and tetraantennary oligosaccharides contains α-galactosyl residues in normal SEC (Fig. 3, A andC). On the other hand, α-galactosyl residues are not found in most oligosaccharides from the transfected SEC, which predominantly consist of the bisected biantennary type (Fig. 3, B andD). The total amount of α-galactosylated oligosaccharides in the GnT-III-transfected SEC was estimated to be less than 10% that of the normal cells.A similar analysis was also carried out to examine sialylation at the non-reducing terminus. As shown for the analysis of α-galactosylation, a difference in a peak area between the absence and presence of sialidase in the glycosidase mixture was attributed to the fractions of oligosaccharides associated with sialylation. In contrast to the case of α-galactosylation, it was found that the GnT-III-transfected SEC produce sialylated N-glycans at levels comparable to normal cells (Fig. 3, B andF). Furthermore, comparison of sialylated fractions in the biantennary species that were non-bisected in the normal SEC and bisected in the transfected SEC indicates that sialylation is much more prevalent in the transfected cells than in the normal cells. It appears that the sialylation is predominantly an α2,6-linked type rather than an α2,3-linkage, as evidenced by the combined use of sialidases with different preferences toward α2,3- and α2,6-linkages (data not shown).The non-reducing terminal structures of the biantennary oligosaccharides in normal and GnT-III-transfected SEC are summarized in Table I. Such structural differences caused by the transfection with GnT-III cannot be explained by variations in the activities of glycosyltransferases involved in the biosyntheses of the terminal structures because the activities of these glycosyltransferases in the transfected cells were similar to those in the normal cells (Table II). Thus, it can reasonably be assumed from the results obtained from the structural analyses that the non-bisected and bisected oligosaccharides otherwise prefer either of two competitive terminal modifications, α-galactosylation and sialylation, in the cells.Table ICompositions of non-reducing terminal residues of the biantennary oligosaccharides from normal and GnT-III-transfected cellsTerminal glycosylationNormal cells1-aNon-bisected oligosaccharides, as the result of the absence of the bisected sugar chains in the cells.GnT-III transfected cells1-bRepresents bisected oligosaccharides, since the transfected cells produce nearly no detectable non-bisected biantennary oligosaccharides.%α-Galactosylated4141-cDi-α-galactosylated bisected biantennary oligosaccharide was not detected.Sialylated61-dMono-sialylated, 4%; di-sialylated, 2%.531-eMono-sialylated, 31%; di-sialylated, 22%.α-Galactosylated/sialylated74β-Galactosylated orN-acetylglucosaminylated46391-a Non-bisected oligosaccharides, as the result of the absence of the bisected sugar chains in the cells.1-b Represents bisected oligosaccharides, since the transfected cells produce nearly no detectable non-bisected biantennary oligosaccharides.1-c Di-α-galactosylated bisected biantennary oligosaccharide was not detected.1-d Mono-sialylated, 4%; di-sialylated, 2%.1-e Mono-sialylated, 31%; di-sialylated, 22%.

Open table in a new tab Modulation of biosynthetic pathway of the terminal structure by the addition of the bisecting GlcNAc appeared to be based on an alteration in the susceptibilities of the oligosaccharide toward α1,3-GT and α2,6-ST. Thus, a relatively detailed time course study was carried out to examine the mechanism of this modulation in terms of a kinetic basis. Reactions involving the conversion as the digalacto-biantennary sugar chain to the di-α-galactosylated or di-sialylated form are illustrated in Fig. 4. The reaction rate,v, for each step follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Under conditions where the concentrations of glycosyl donors and acceptor oligosaccharides are saturating and sufficiently lower than theK m values, respectively, the velocities can be approximated as v = (k cat/ K macceptor) [E 0][S], whereE 0 and S represent the total enzyme concentration and oligosaccharide acceptor concentration, respectively, and the rate equation may then be treated as a simple second-order reaction. Since [E 0] is constant during the reaction, the equation can further be converted to v =k [S], where k equalsk cat[E 0]/ K macceptorand thus can be regarded as a pseudo first-order rate constant. Therefore, the time course for possible oligosaccharide species that appear during the α-galactosylation and the sialylation of the biantennae may be defined by Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4.

The conditions used for the kinetic analysis might not be physiological in terms of the substrate concentrations. In general, however, the difference in the reactivities of the substrates can be estimated by comparingk cat/K m. It would be useful to treat these enzyme reactions as combination of pseudo first-order reactions, even though the model may not directly be applicable to other conditions.Figure 4Reaction scheme for the formation of the di-α-galactosylated or the di-sialylated biantennary oligosaccharide.

Time courses for the α-galactosylation and sialylation of the non-bisected and bisected biantennary oligosaccharides are shown in Fig. 5. To obtain the rate constants shown in Fig. 4, all plot sets were fit to Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4 by a non-linear regression analysis (TableIII). Although α1,3-GT preferred the Manα1,6-branch to the Manα1,3-branch regardless of the presence of the bisecting GlcNAc residue, the presence of this residue lowered the rates of all steps in the α-galactosylation. In particular, the step in which the di-α-galactosylated oligosaccharide was formed from the oligosaccharide with mono-α-galactosyl residue linked to the Manα1,6-branch was affected to a greater extent, thus leading to a marked suppression of the formation of the di-α-galactosyl oligosaccharide (Fig. 5, A andB).

Conserved aromatic residues in the T peptide are shown in boldface letters; in H and T peptides, cysteines that may establish intercatenary disulfide bonds are shaded. In the C2-T construct, six residues from the H peptide (doubly underlined), including the proximal cysteine C6 were inserted upstream of the T peptide. The mutated residue in T1 is underlined. The H peptide contains one or two cysteines that are close to the catalytic domain and may form intercatenary disulfide bonds and also contains a signal for cleavage and the addition of a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI). The AChEH subunits thus generate mature GPI-anchored amphiphilic dimers, which retain only a few residues beyond the catalytic domain. X-ray crystallography studies of Torpedo dimers showed that the contact zone between the two monomers is a “four-helix bundle” (FHB), formed by the α7,8 and α10 helices from each catalytic domain (Fig. 1); hydrophobic residues occupy a large proportion of this interface (2Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar). The same contact was observed in crystals of mouse AChE from which the C-terminal T peptide had been deleted and which was monomeric in solution (3Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The T (WAT) peptide possesses a free cysteine, which is located near its C terminus, at a distance of 36 residues from the catalytic domain (Table I); this peptide forms an amphiphilic α helix, and its presence allows a variety of quaternary associations (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). The AChET subunits generate monomers, dimers, and tetramers. Tetramers of AChET subunits also assemble around structural proteins; the hydrophobic P protein anchors the enzyme in cell membranes of the central nervous system (4Gennari K. Brunner J. Brodbeck U. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Inestrosa N.C. Roberts W.L. Marshall T.L. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4441-4444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and collagen ColQ attaches it to the basal lamina of neuromuscular junctions (6Krejci E. Thomine S. Boschetti N. Legay C.

J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Isolated T peptides can associate with a short “proline-rich attachment domain” (PRAD) of the N-terminal region of ColQ (8Bon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3007-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Bon S. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); the C-terminal T peptide therefore behaves as an autonomous interaction domain and has been named the WAT domain (10Simon S. Krejci E. Massoulié J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6178-6187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This suggests that the catalytic domain of AChE does not play a major part in the assembly of an AChET tetramer around the PRAD. X-ray crystallography of Electrophorus AChETtetramers, derived from collagen-tailed molecules, showed that the subunits are organized in a skewed quasi-square arrangement (11Bourne Y. Grassi J. Bougis P.E. Marchot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30370-30376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,24Raves M. Structure-Function Studies on Acetylcholinesterase in Space and Time.Ph.D. thesis. Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel1998Google Scholar). However, the structure has not been solved at a sufficient resolution to identify the contact zones between subunits. In a tentative model, K. Giles proposed to call these contacts the weak hydrophobic interaction, corresponding to the FHB that exists in AChEH dimers, and the strong hydrophobic interaction, based on the T (WAT) peptides (12Giles K. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). If these denominations really reflect the relative strength of the quaternary interactions, AChETdimers should be associated through strong hydrophobic interaction rather than weak hydrophobic interaction. AChEH and AChET dimers would therefore be organized differently, and this appears consistent with the fact that the intercatenary disulfide bonds are not located at the same distance from the catalytic domains in the two types of subunits. We introduced mutations in the α7,8 and α10helices of Torpedo and rat AChEs to modify the FHB interaction by steric hindrance, reduction of hydrophobic interactions, or electrostatic repulsion. We analyzed their effects on the biogenesis of AChE and on its molecular forms. In Torpedo, we studied AChEH and AChET subunits; in rat, we also analyzed truncated molecules, AChEC, which were derived from AChEH subunits by deletion of the GPI addition signal and produced secreted enzyme. To assess the importance of intercatenary disulfide bonds, we mutated the cysteines of H and T peptides; in the case of AChET subunits, we also introduced a proximal cysteine, as in the H peptide. The resulting C-terminal peptides are shown in Table I. AChET subunits were expressed alone or with an N-terminal fragment of ColQ, called QN, that contains the PRAD and consequently induces the organization of soluble PRAD-linked tetramers, which are readily secreted (8Bon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3007-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Bon S. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This strategy was expected to reveal whether AChET dimers are based on the same interactions as AChEH or on another type of quaternary contact and also to provide some information on the respective roles of the catalytic domain and of the T peptide (WAT) in the formation of AChET dimers and of tetramers, both homomeric and associated with a PRAD. Our results demonstrate that AChET dimers are linked through the FHB, like AChEH dimers. In addition, we found that FHB mutations could direct AChE toward degradation rather than secretion; this was much more marked for AChET than for AChEH or AChEC. In contrast with wild type AChETsubunits, the mutant subunits were not secreted to any significant extent, except when they were engaged in PRAD-linked tetramers. This suggests a cross-talk between two independent functional domains of AChE, the catalytic domain (FHB mutations), and the tetramerization domain (WAT peptide). Torpedo and rat AChEH and AChET were expressed in the pEF-BOS vector (13Legay C. Bon S. Vernier P. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed by the method of Kunkel et al.(14Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Truncated rat AChEC1 and AChEC2 subunits were obtained by introducing stop codons immediately after the catalytic domain or at the position of the second cysteine of AChEH, respectively. The C2-T construct was obtained by inserting the first six residues of H (ATEVPC) upstream of the rat T peptide. COS cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method, as previously described (8Bon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3007-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), using 5 μg of DNA encoding the AChE catalytic subunit per 100-mm dish. Co-expression of AChETwith QN/stop 551 (8Bon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3007-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was obtained by adding 3 μg of DNA encoding this protein. After transfection, COS cells were incubated for 1 day at 37 °C, followed by 2 days at 27 °C in the case ofTorpedo AChE, or for 2–3 days at 37 °C in the case of rat AChE, in a medium containing 10% Nuserum (Inotech, Dottikon, Switzerland), which had been pretreated with 10−5m soman to inactivate serum cholinesterases. The cells were extracted with TMg buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2) at 20 °C to solubilize the GPI-anchored molecules. For PI-PLC digestion, samples of detergent extracts (50 μl) were incubated in TMg buffer for 1 h at 30 °C with a 1% volume (0.025 IU) of PI-PLC from Bacillus thuringiensis (Immunotech (Marseille, France or Glyko Europe, Upper Heyford, UK)). Electrophoretic analyses in nondenaturing conditions and evaluation of PI-PLC-sensitive and -resistant components were performed as previously described (15Coussen F. Ayon A. Le Goff A. Leroy J. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27881-27894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). AChE activity was determined by the colorimetric method of Ellman et al. (16Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21721) Google Scholar) at room temperature (20 °C). Enzyme samples (10 μl) were added to 0.2 ml of Ellman assay medium in microplates, and the reaction was monitored at 414 nm with a Labsystems Multiskan RC automatic plate reader (Helsinki, Finland); the optical density was recorded at 20-s intervals over a period of 5 min. Two days after transfection, COS cells were preincubated for 45 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without cysteine and methionine and labeled for 30 min with 50–100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After labeling, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and chased in medium containing Nuserum; at various times, the medium was collected, and the cells were extracted in a buffer containing 20 mm sodium borate, pH 9, 1m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma; reference number P8340); the cell extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. The cell extracts and the media were incubated overnight at 8 °C with a 1:300 dilution of the polyclonal anti-rat AChE rabbit antiserum A63 under rotatory agitation (17Marsh D. Grassi J. Vigny M. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and then mixed with 20 μl of a suspension of protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) and incubated for 3 h at 8 °C. The beads were rinsed three times with extraction buffer, and the immunoprecipitated AChE sample was analyzed by electrophoresis under reducing and denaturing conditions (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), using a Fuji image analyzer (BAS 1000). Centrifugation was performed in 5–20% sucrose gradients (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm MgCl2, either in the presence of 1% Brij or in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100) in a Beckman SW41 rotor, at 36,000 rpm, for 18 h at 6 °C. The gradients containedEscherichia coli β-galactosidase (16 S) and alkaline phosphatase (6.1 S) as internal sedimentation standards. Electrophoresis in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels were performed as described previously (18Bon S. Toutant J.P. Méflah K. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and AChE activity was revealed by the histochemical method of Karnovsky and Roots (19Karnovsky M.J. Roots L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1964; 12: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar). 100 μl of medium containing secreted AChE was incubated at 47 °C. At appropriate time intervals, 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn and stored on ice. Their residual activity was assayed at 20 °C by the Ellman method within 1 h. Several dishes of transfected cells, expressing AChE at the steady state, were incubated for 30 min in the presence of 2 × 10−6 msoman, a membrane-permeant, irreversible inhibitor of cholinesterases. They were then extensively washed and incubated in fresh medium. The cellular activities were determined from individual dishes over a period of 3 h. Fig. 1 was prepared with the GRASP software (20Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). The presence of anN-glycan in the zone of contact between two subunits was expected to weaken or prevent the formation of dimers of AChEH subunits. We introduced a potentialN-glycosylation site at the surface of the α10helix, in the dimeric contact zone, with the double mutation F527N/P529S. The mutant protein was efficiently synthesized by COS cells, as judged by intracellular immunofluorescence of permeabilized cells with an anti-Torpedo AChE antiserum, but the protein remained inactive, and it was not externalized at the plasma membrane. This suggests that the presence of anN-glycosylation site on the α10 helix interfered with the folding of the enzyme. We also added a potential N-glycosylation site at position370, on the α7,8 helix, by mutation A370N (a single mutation was sufficient, because residue 372 is a threonine). Mutations A370S and A370Q were used as controls. Mutation A370N did not abolish the production of active AChEH or AChET subunits but reduced it to about 1% of the wild type; mutations A370S and A370Q produced 100 and 50%, respectively, of the wild type level for AChEH and 15 and 5% for AChET. Like the wild type, the A370S mutant AChEHsubunits produced GPI-anchored dimers (G2a) and a low level of secreted nonamphiphilic dimers; in contrast, the A370Q mutant produced mainly GPI-anchored monomers. The proportion of dimers, determined from sedimentation profiles of cell extracts, decreased in the same order as the level of activity: wild type > A370S > A370Q ≫ A370N. The fact that the levels of activity and dimerization were much more affected when alanine 370 was replaced by an asparagine (A370N) than by a more bulky residue (A370Q) suggests that the N-glycosylation site was actually used. In the case of AChET subunits, the wild type and mutant A370S produced mostly dimers, but mutant A370Q produced essentially monomers (Fig. 2). Both mutations suppressed amphiphilic tetramers; in contrast, nonamphiphilic tetramers were only slightly reduced by mutation A370Q. Co-expression of the wild type and mutant AChET subunits with the QN fragment of the ColQ collagen, which contains the PRAD (9Bon S. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), induced the assembly and the secretion of PRAD-associated tetramers. In addition, it increased the total production of activity for mutant A370S and to a lesser extent for mutant A370Q, showing that the mutated subunits retained the capacity to associate with the PRAD and were partially rescued by this association. There was no increase for A370N, showing that N-glycosylation prevented the tetramerization of AChET subunits. The three mutations of Ala370 had stronger effects on AChET subunits than on AChEH subunits, reducing dimerization, further oligomerization, and also the levels of activity and secretion. We wondered whether this was related to the fact that the intercatenary disulfide bond in AChET dimers and other oligomers is more distal than in AChEH dimers. We therefore introduced the double mutation I538C/C572S, to replace the distal cysteine by a proximal one. In the absence of other mutations, this increased the level of activity by about 30%. In the case of the A370Q mutant, the total activity and the proportion of secreted AChE remained low but were approximately doubled. The levels of cellular and secreted activity were not increased for the A370N mutant. Thus, the fact that FHB mutations affected AChET subunits more dramatically than AChEH subunits was not simply due to the presence of a distal or proximal cysteine, respectively. We then examined whether these results could be generalized to mammalian AChE, in particular because it is more abundantly secreted. To introduce anN-glycosylation site in the α7,8 helix of rat AChE, we constructed the double mutant A370N/V372T (in this paper, we use theTorpedo numbering (21Massoulié J. Sussman J.L. Doctor B.P. Soreq H. Velan B. Cygler M. Rotundo R.L. Shafferman A. Silman I. Taylor P. Shafferman A. Velan B. Multidisciplinary Approaches to Cholinesterase Functions. Plenum Press, New York1992: 285-288Google Scholar)). Mutants A370N and A370Q/V372T were made as nonglycosylable controls. To assess the role of hydrophobic interactions in the FHB, we replaced phenylalanine 527 in the α10 helix by a leucine, an alanine, or a glutamic acid. As shown in Table I, we analyzed the impact of mutations in the FHB contact zone on several types of subunits, characterized by the presence of the C-terminal H peptide (subunits H1 and H2), of a truncated H peptide (subunits C1 and C2), and of the T peptide (subunits T1 and T2); in subunits H1, C1, and T1, the cysteines that may be involved in intercatenary disulfide bonds were mutated or deleted. In the case of T subunits, we replaced cysteine 572 by a cysteine in a proximal position, by point mutations (L538C/C572S) in T1L538C subunits. We also constructed C2-T subunits, in which a fragment of the H peptide, containing the first cysteine, was inserted upstream of the T peptide (Table I). In the case of wild type C2 subunits, the sedimentation profiles obtained for both the cells and the medium showed a predominant peak corresponding to nonamphiphilic dimers, with a small proportion of monomers (Fig. 3,upper row). In the mutants, the cellular active enzyme was almost exclusively monomeric, indicating that the mutations indeed compromised dimerization. The secreted enzyme was partly dimeric, and the proportion of dimers decreased in the following order: wild type > F527L > A370N, F527E, F527A > A370Q/V372T ≫ A370N/V372T. Clearly, the presence of anN-glycosylation site had a much stronger effect than the other mutations on the production of dimers. This analysis was confirmed by electrophoresis in nondenaturing conditions (not shown); the wild type C2 AChE presented a major dimeric component, while mutants showed variable proportions of a faster migrating band, corresponding to monomeric AChE. This species represented the low level of activity produced by the A370N/V372T mutant. H1 and H2 subunits produced GPI-anchored AChE forms, which were characterized by their sensitivity to PI-PLC. The cellular extracts and the medium also contained amphiphilic uncleaved molecules and nonamphiphilic lytic molecules (15Coussen F. Ayon A. Le Goff A. Leroy J. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27881-27894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The level of activity was considerably lower in the case of the A370N/V372T mutant, as discussed below, and this mutant produced an unusual nonamphiphilic species. For all other mutants, quantitative scanning of electrophoretic patterns showed that the cells contained the same proportion of GPI-anchored enzyme as for the wild type, in agreement with the fact that they possessed the same GPI addition signal. Sedimentation analyses (not shown) and electrophoretic patterns (Fig.4) showed that the wild type H2 subunits produced mostly GPI-anchored dimers, while the mutants produced variable proportions of GPI-anchored monomers and dimers (not shown). In the medium, the proportions of secreted monomers and dimers were similar to those obtained with the corresponding C2 subunits. These results confirm the involvement of the two α helices in the dimerization of glypiated H subunits. Sedimentation and electrophoretic analyses showed that, surprisingly, the wild type H1 subunits did not behave as simple monomers like the C1 subunits, although they could not form disulfide-linked dimers; instead, they appeared to dimerize reversibly, in a detergent-dependent manner. The sedimentation profiles of cell extracts showed a single peak, corresponding to monomers, in gradients containing Triton X-100 (Fig.5A) but two peaks in the presence of Brij-96, suggesting that the enzyme was partially dimerized. The proportion of the faster sedimenting component increased with the concentration of enzyme in the sample that was layered on the gradient (Fig. 5, A and C). When gradient fractions corresponding to each of these components were diluted and analyzed in a second gradient, they showed again a similar bimodal distribution (Fig. 5D). The bimodal sedimentation pattern therefore reflects a reversible association-dissociation equilibrium between the two species. In contrast, fractions corresponding to monomers and dimers produced by mutant H2 subunits sedimented as homogenous, distinct species when analyzed in a second gradient (not shown). The existence of a reversible equilibrium between two components, in the case of wild type H1 subunits, was confirmed by nondenaturing electrophoresis of gradient fractions; all fractions produced the same broad distribution, overlapping the bands obtained for the monomers and dimers, produced by mutant H2 AChE (not shown). The lytic molecules obtained from GPI-anchored H1 subunits after treatment with PI-PLC sedimented as homogenous monomers, similar to those produced by C1 subunits; in both cases, nonamphiphilic G1na forms, produced either directly by C1 or after PI-PLC digestion of H1, did not generate reversible dimers under our experimental conditions (Fig. 5B). Together with the fact that reversible dimerization was observed in the presence of Brij-96, but not of Triton X-100, this suggests that the noncovalent interaction of GPI-anchored H1 subunits was dependent on their interaction with detergent micelles. The GPI-anchored H1 mutants did not show any significant dimerization in sedimentation and electrophoretic analyses, under similar experimental conditions, indicating that the FHB interaction is required for this reversible association. Sedimentation analyses (Fig. 3, lower row) and nondenaturing electrophoresis (Fig.6) showed that in the case of the wild type rat T2 subunits, the cell extracts contained mainly monomers, together with smaller proportions of dimers, nonamphiphilic tetramers, and 13.5 S aggregates, whereas in the case of Torpedo they contained mostly dimers and amphiphilic tetramers. COS cells expressing the rat T2 subunits secreted similar amounts of monomers and dimers, together with some nonamphiphilic tetramers. All mutations, including F527L, suppressed the 13.5 S component, which seems to be intrinsically unstable, since it readily dissociates in the presence of Triton X-100 (8Bon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3007-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The F527L mutation had little effect on dimerization. The other mutations suppressed the formation of dimers, as shown by electrophoretic patterns (Fig. 6). However, the sedimentation profiles still showed a broad 4.5 S component, sedimenting like the wild type G2aform, in the presence of Brij-96 (Fig. 3). An analysis of the corresponding fractions by nondenaturing electrophoresis confirmed the identity of the 3 S amphiphilic monomers (G1a) in the wild type and in the mutants and of the 4.5 S amphiphilic dimers (G2a) in the wild type. In the mutants, the 4.5 S component was found to contain nonamphiphilic molecules, as illustrated in the case of F527A (Fig.7). These molecules did not interact with detergent micelles and were not assembled into tetramers by co-expression with QN (Fig. 6), but they differed in their electrophoretic mobility from the nonamphiphilic monomers produced by C1 subunits. All FHB mutants, except A370N/V372T, produced some G4na tetramers, even when the formation of dimers and 13.5 S oligomers was blocked; different quaternary interactions are obviously responsible for the assembly and stability of dimers and of nonamphiphilic tetramers, as already suggested in the case of Torpedo. To assess the importance of an intercatenary disulfide bond and of its position for dimerization, we analyzed T1, T1L538C, and C2-T subunits. We found that the T1 subunits produced mainly monomers, together with a small proportion of tetramers, but no dimers, in agreement with previous findings on human AChE (22Velan B. Grosfeld H. Kronman C. Leitner M. Gozes Y. Lazar A. Flashner Y. Marcus D. Cohen S. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23977-23984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); in contrast, the T1L538C and C2-T subunits produced a higher proportion of dimers than the T2 subunits, particularly for the wild type (Fig. 8), showing that a proximal cysteine can more efficiently form an intercatenary disulfide bond. We examined whether T1 monomers could reversibly associate into covalent dimers, because they interact with detergent micelles, although their electrophoretic migration differs from that of GPI-anchored monomers produced from H1 subunits. We could not detect any sign of T1 dimers, either in sedimentation or in nondenaturing electrophoresis, under the same experimental conditions"

RI and RII are serine/threonine kinases, and an active receptor complex consists of two molecules each of RI and RII, which are essential for TGF-β signal transduction and inhibition of cell growth (3Lin H.Y.

Recent studies indicate that following TGF-β binding and subsequent activation of RI by RII, RI phosphorylates smad 2 and/or smad 3, which can then associate with smad 4 and translocate to the nucleus, where binding to the target DNA or other DNA-binding proteins occurs. In contrast, smad 7 was found to antagonize the TGF-β signaling pathway by binding to RI, thereby preventing the activation of smad 2 and smad 3 (7Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the vital roles of TGF-β is the growth inhibition of normal epithelial cells, as well as some cancer cells. Because RI and RII are important for TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition, a loss of either receptor contributes to TGF-β resistance and subsequent tumor formation and progression (8Sun L.-Z. Wu G.

RI and RII promoters lack distinct TATA boxes, are highly GC-rich, and depend on Sp1 transcription factor for the initiation of transcription. Whereas the RI promoter contains four consensus and several putative Sp1 sites, the RII promoter contains two Sp1 sites. Within the Sp gene family of transcription factors, Sp1, Sp2, and Sp4 are known to be activators of gene transcription, whereas Sp3 is generally considered to be a repressor (19Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors recognize the same DNA element and have similar binding affinities. Sp3 has been shown to repress Sp1-mediated trans-activation of several genes (20Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G.

Recent studies indicated DNA methylation as a mode of inactivation of several genes, including some that are involved in cell cycle control. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, 5-aza cytidine (5-azaC) and 5-aza-2′ deoxycytidine are the most commonly used DNA demethylating agents to reverse methylation and reactivate the expression of these genes (23Robertson K.D. Jones P.A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). MCF-7L and GEO cells are resistant to growth inhibition by TGF-β because of the reduced expression of RI and RII (8Sun L.-Z. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajakarunanayake I. Wang J.

We have previously reported that treatment of these cells with 5-azaC induced RI, RII mRNA levels and consequently increased the expression of cell-surface RI and RII (14Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.-J.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4660-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Significantly, increased RI and RII expression resulted in the restoration of TGF-β response, as evidenced by the enhanced activity of a TGF-β-responsive plasminogen activator inhibitor promoter-luciferase reporter in the 5-azaC-treated cells (14Ammanamanchi S.

However, Southern analysis following 5-azaC treatment ruled out the demethylation of RI and RII genes as a contributor to RI and RII expression (14Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.-J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4660-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have shown that MCF-7L and GEO cells were Sp1-deficient and that 5-azaC treatment increased Sp1 protein levels as a result of increased Sp1 protein stability, leading to RI and RII expression (14Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.-J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16527-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Periyasamy S. Ammanamanchi S. Tillekeratne M.P.M. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4660-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that MCF-7L and GEO cells express high levels of Sp3 protein, which acts as a transcriptional repressor of RI and RII (24Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3348-3352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This raises the question of how methyltransferase inhibition affects Sp3 as well as Sp1. We now report that 5-azaC treatment of MCF-7L breast and GEO colon cancer cells decreases Sp3 protein levels and hence results in decreased binding to RI and RII promoters. This decreased Sp3 binding contributes to enhanced RI and RII expression in these cells. Taken together, the previous and present studies on MCF-7L breast and GEO colon cancer cells indicate that the demethylation-enhanced expression of TGF-β receptors is due to a combination of effects on Sp1 and Sp3. Moreover, whereas modulation of Sp1 was shown to be posttranscriptional, Sp3 repression occurs through decreased transcription of the Sp3 gene. MCF-7L cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), amino acids, antibiotics, pyruvate, and vitamins (Life Technologies, Inc.). GEO colon cancer cells were grown in serum-free medium as previously described (10Wang J. Han W. Zborowska E. Liang J. Wang X.-F. Willson J.K.V. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17366-17371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. 5-AzaC was added to growth medium in two 24-h pulses on days 2 and 5. On day 6, 5-azaC-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were grown for another 2 days in the absence of 5-azaC. Cells were used on day 8 for RNA determinations, isolation of nuclear extracts for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), and Western blots. Nuclear extracts (5 µg) were obtained from control and 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L breast and GEO colon carcinoma cells, and Western analysis was performed as described previously (14Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.-J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16527-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-human Sp3 and c-Jun polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (14Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.-J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16527-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Whenever Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies were used, the nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 µg of Sp1 or Sp3 antibody (anti-rabbit, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 15 min on ice prior to the addition of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide. Southwestern analysis was performed as described previously (22Kumar A.P. Butler A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2012-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked overnight with 2.5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in 25 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The membrane was then incubated with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled RI (–618 bp to the start site) and RII (–274 bp to the start site) promoter probes and poly(dI·dC) as a competitor for nonspecific binding for 4 h. Later, the membrane was washed with wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), dried, and autoradiographed. Total RNA from control and 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells was reverse-transcribed into cDNA. PCR analysis was then performed to determine the RI, RII, and Sp3 expression levels in control and 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells using the respective cDNAs as templates. Primers for actin were used as controls to determine the RI, RII, and Sp3 expression levels. RT-PCR analysis is a rough estimate of the changes in RNA levels following 5-azaC treatment. A total of 30 cycles of amplification were performed. Primers for RI generate a 865-bp fragment as follows: sense primers, TTG TGG CAC GGT GAG AGT GT; antisense primers, TGC TCC TGG GCT ATT GAA TCA. Primers for RII generate a 1003-bp fragment as follows: sense primers, GCC AAC AAC ATC AAC CAC AAC ACA; antisense primers, TAG TGT TTA GGG AGC CGT CTT CAG. Primers for actin generate a 621-bp fragment as follows: sense primers, ACA CTG TGC CCA TCT ACG AGG; antisense primers, AGG GGC CGG ACT CGT CAT ACT. Primers for Sp3 generate a 450-bp fragment as follows: sense primers, AGG TTC AGG GAG TTG CAA TT; antisense primers, TCT GTG CCT GTG TCT CTT CA. Isolation of nuclei and nuclear run-on assays were performed as described previously (16Periyasamy S. Ammanamanchi S. Tillekeratne M.P.M. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4660-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, control and 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells were lysed, and the nuclei were pelleted by brief centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 200 µl of reaction buffer (150 mm potassium acetate; 10 mm MgCl2; 0.1 mm dithiothreitol; 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0); 10% glycerol; 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP; 13 µm UTP; and 100 µCi of [α-32P]UTP ([3000 Ci/mmol), PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The32P-labeled RNA was isolated by cesium gradient centrifugation, and an equal amount of radioactivity in 5 ml of hybridization buffer was added to each filter and incubated for 2 days at 45 °C. Filters were prepared using the Schleicher and Schuell slot blot system. Each slot was loaded with 10 µg of linearized, alkali-denatured plasmid and then washed with 1 m ammonium acetate. The Sp3 plasmid contained a 3.14-kilobase linearizedNotI cDNA fragment. The actin plasmid with a 1.6-kilobase linearized BamHI-HindIII cDNA fragment and vector without Sp3 insert were used as controls. The plasmid DNA was immobilized on nitrocellulose filters by baking at 80 °C for 1.5 h in a vacuum oven. After hybridization, filters were washed twice in 2× SSPE (sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, and EDTA) solution at 45 °C for a total of 60 min and then transferred to 2× SSPE solution containing RNase A (10 µg/ml), incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, air-dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with intensifying screens. The CMV-Sp3 cDNA vector or the CMV control vector without Sp3 cDNA was stably transfected into MCF-7L cells using the Fugene 6 chemical method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The control vector-transfected cells are referred to as MCF-7L Neo, and Sp3 transfectants are referred to as MCF-7L Sp3 cells. RT-PCR analysis using RI and RII primers was performed on total RNA from control and 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells to determine whether treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza cytidine leads to RI and RII expression. RI and RII transcripts were induced in the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells (Fig. 1). Actin, which was used as a control, was not affected, thus confirming the selectivity of 5-azaC effects on RI and RII expression. We have previously reported that Sp3 acts as a transcriptional repressor of RI and RII in MCF-7L and GEO cells (24Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3348-3352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine whether 5-azaC-mediated Sp3 down-regulation is leading to RI and RII expression in MCF-7L and GEO cells, Western immunoblot analysis using Sp3 antibody was performed on the control and 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells. Sp3 antibody recognizes a doublet at 115 kDa and two 68–70-kDa species. The Sp3 protein doublet at 115 kDa may be the result of differential posttranslational modification, as seen in the case of Sp1 (14Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.-J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16527-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The 68–70-kDa species are the result of differential internal translation initiation (25Kennet S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Only the 115-kDa species has been reported to be biologically active. 5-AzaC treatment reduced the expression of all the Sp3 isoforms, whereas there was no difference in the c-Jun levels, indicating selectivity of Sp3 modulation (Fig.2). EMSAs were performed using control and 5-azaC-treated nuclear extracts with 32P-labeled consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide to determine the DNA binding activities of Sp3. One high mobility complex and one low mobility complex were detected in the control MCF-7L and GEO nuclear extracts (Fig.3a, lanes 2 and 7). Preincubation of the control nuclear extracts with Sp3 antibody prior to the addition of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide completely depleted the high mobility complex and a major portion of the low mobility complex, indicating that those complexes contain Sp3 protein (Fig. 3 a, lanes 3 and 8). 5-AzaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO nuclear extracts either with or without Sp3 antibody preincubation show loss of binding of the high mobility complex but not the low mobility complex (Fig. 3 a, lanes 4, 5, 9, and10). Sp1 and Sp3 proteins recognize the same GC element and have similar DNA binding affinities (19Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO nuclear extracts show enhanced Sp1 binding to radiolabeled Sp1 oligonucleotide (14Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.-J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16527-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Periyasamy S. Ammanamanchi S. Tillekeratne M.P.M. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4660-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine whether the low mobility complex in the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO nuclear extracts contains Sp1, we have preincubated the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO nuclear extracts with Sp1 antibody prior to the addition of 32P-labeled Sp1 oligonucleotide. The data indicate depletion of low mobility complex in the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO nuclear extracts (Fig. 3 a, lanes 6 and 11), thus confirming the presence of Sp1 in the complex. Consequently, 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO nuclear extracts show decreased Sp3 binding but enhanced Sp1 binding to the radiolabeled Sp1 oligonucleotide. Preincubation of the control MCF-7L and GEO nuclear extracts with Sp1 antibody prior to the addition of32P-labeled Sp1 oligonucleotide did not deplete the high mobility complex and depleted only a minor portion of the low mobility complex (Fig. 3 b, lanes 3 and 5). These complexes were depleted when preincubated with Sp3 antibody (Fig. 3 a, lanes 3 and 8), which indicates the specificity of the Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies used. We have previously reported that Sp3 binding to RI and RII promoters is a contributor to RI and RII repression in MCF-7L breast and GEO colon cancer cells (24Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3348-3352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Southwestern analysis using radiolabeled RI and RII promoters was carried out to determine whether the decreased Sp3 binding to RI and RII promoters was contributing to RI and RII induction in the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells. The data indicate a significant loss of Sp3 binding to RI promoter (Fig.4) and RII promoter (Fig.5) in the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells. We observed the binding of 95–100-kDa protein species to RI and RII promoters in the control and 5-azaC-treated cells. However, these protein species were not influenced by 5-azaC treatment.Figure 5Detection of Sp3 binding to RII promoter.

The Sp3 message was down-regulated in the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells (Fig.6). Actin expression levels were not affected, thus confirming the selectivity of 5-azaC effects on Sp3. Transcriptional analyses of Sp3 using nuclear run-on assays were performed to determine whether 5-azaC was affecting Sp3 transcription, resulting in down-regulation of Sp3 mRNA. The data show repression of Sp3 transcription in the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells (Fig.7). Transcription of actin, which was used as a control, was not affected, thus confirming the selectivity of 5-azaC effects on Sp3 transcription.Figure 7Effect of 5-azaC on Sp3 transcription.Sp3 transcriptional analyses were performed in control and 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells using nuclear run-on assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 5-AzaC treatment of MCF-7L cells led to TGFβ receptor induction through a combination of increased Sp1 protein levels/activities (14Ammanamanchi S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16527-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and decreased Sp3 protein levels/activities (Figs. 2 and 3 a). To further confirm that 5-azaC-mediated Sp3 down-regulation is required for the TGF-β receptor induction in MCF-7L cells, we stably expressed Sp3 cDNA under the control of a CMV promoter in MCF-7L cells and analyzed the 5-azaC effects on TGF-β receptor induction in MCF-7L Neo and MCF-7L Sp3 cells. If 5-azaC-mediated Sp3 down-regulation was contributing to TGF-β receptor induction in MCF-7L cells, we would expect to see the TGF-β receptor induction in MCF-7L cells but not in MCF-7L Sp3 cells, because the ectopic Sp3 expression was under the control of a CMV promoter. 5-AzaC does not affect the CMV promoter activity (14Ammanamanchi S.

RT-PCR analysis using RI and RII primers was performed on total RNA from MCF-7L Neo and ectopic Sp3 expressing MCF-7L cells (MCF-7L Sp3) to determine whether treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza cytidine leads to RI and RII expression. RI and RII transcripts were induced in the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L Neo cells but not in MCF-7L Sp3 cells (Fig. 8). These data indicate that ectopic Sp3 was blocking 5-azaC-mediated TGF-β receptor induction in MCF-7L cells. Actin, which was used as a control, was not affected, thus confirming the selectivity of 5-azaC effects on RI and RII expression. Western analysis using Sp3 antibody was carried out to determine whether lack of ectopic Sp3 down-regulation following 5-azaC treatment was blocking TGF-β receptor induction in MCF-7L Sp3 cells. Whereas the endogenous Sp3 protein levels were decreased following 5-azaC treatment in the MCF-7L Neo control cells, ectopic Sp3 protein levels were not affected by 5-azaC treatment in the MCF-7L Sp3 cells (Fig.9). These data confirm that 5-azaC-mediated Sp3 down-regulation is required for TGF-β receptor induction in MCF-7L cells. There was no difference in the c-Jun levels, indicating the selectivity of Sp3 modulation. EMSAs were performed using MCF-7L Neo and MCF-7L Sp3 nuclear extracts with32P-labeled consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide to determine the DNA binding activities of Sp3. One high mobility complex and one low mobility complex were detected in the MCF-7L Neo and MCF-7L Sp3 cells (Fig. 10, a, lane 1, andb, lane 1). Preincubation of the MCF-7L Neo nuclear extracts with Sp3 antibody prior to the addition of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide completely depleted the high mobility complex and a major portion of the low mobility complex, indicating that both complexes contain Sp3 protein (Fig. 10 a, lane 2). 5-AzaC-treated MCF-7L Neo nuclear extracts either with or without Sp3 antibody preincubation showed loss of binding of the high mobility complex but not the low mobility complex, indicating that only the high mobility complex contains Sp3 protein (Fig. 10 a, lanes 3 and4). Preincubation of the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L Neo nuclear extracts with Sp1 antibody showed depletion of the low mobility complex, indicating that the complex contains Sp1 (Fig. 10 a, lane 5). In contrast, preincubation of 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L Sp3 nuclear extracts with Sp1 antibody showed only minor loss of binding of the low mobility complex, indicating that this complex contains low amounts of Sp1 protein (Fig. 10 b, lane 3). However, preincubation of the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L Sp3 nuclear extracts with Sp3 antibody led to the depletion of the high mobility complex and a major portion of the low mobility complex, indicating that both complexes contain Sp3 protein (Fig. 10 b, lane 4). Consequently, 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L Neo nuclear extracts showed decreased Sp3 binding but enhanced Sp1 binding leading to TGF-β receptor expression. In contrast, ectopic Sp3 expressing MCF-7L Sp3 cells did not show loss of Sp3 binding or TGF-β receptor expression following 5-azaC treatment, indicating continued presence of Sp3 as a cause for the blockade of TGF-β receptor induction in MCF-7L Sp3 cells. TGF-β receptors RI and RII are key players in the TGF-β-mediated growth suppression of normal epithelial cells, as well as some cancer cells. Loss of expression of either RI or RII has been associated with TGF-β resistance, leading to tumor formation and progression (8Sun L.-Z. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajakarunanayake I.

We have previously reported the induction of RI and RII expression in GEO and MCF-7L cells through increased Sp1 protein levels/activities by the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza cytidine (14Ammanamanchi S.

Furthermore, we have shown that another member of the Sp gene family, Sp3, acts as a transcriptional repressor of RI and RII in these cells (24Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol.

We now report that in addition to increased Sp1, 5-azaC treatment down-regulates Sp3 expression, thus contributing to RI and RII induction in MCF-7L and GEO cells. These studies demonstrate that the effect of 5-azaC involves a combination of effects on Sp1 and Sp3. The RI and RII promoters lack distinct TATA boxes. However, they contain multiple GC boxes and depend upon Sp1 for the initiation of transcription (17Bloom B.B. Humphries D.E. Kuang P.P. Fine Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys.

MCF-7L and GEO cells are resistant to growth inhibition by TGF-β because of the reduced expression of RI and RII (8Sun L.-Z. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajakarunanayake I. Wang J.

We have previously reported that treatment of these cells with 5-azaC induced TGF-β receptor mRNA levels and consequently increased the expression of cell-surface RI and RII (14Ammanamanchi S.

Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4660-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Significantly, increased RI and RII expression resulted in the restoration of TGF-β response as evidenced by the enhanced activity of a TGF-β-responsive plasminogen activator inhibitor promoter-luciferase reporter in the 5-azaC-treated cells (14Ammanamanchi S.

However, Southern analysis following 5-azaC treatment ruled out the demethylation of RI and RII genes as a contributor to RI and RII expression (14Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.-J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4660-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have shown that MCF-7L and GEO cells were Sp1-deficient and that 5-azaC treatment increased Sp1 protein levels as a result of increased Sp1 protein stability, leading to RI and RII expression (14Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.-J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16527-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Periyasamy S. Ammanamanchi S. Tillekeratne M.P.M. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4660-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, 5-azaC treatment also decreased Sp3 protein levels in MCF-7L and GEO cells (Fig. 2). The Sp3 protein doublet at 115 kDa may be the result of differential posttranslational modification as seen in the case of Sp1 (14Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.-J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16527-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The 115-kDa Sp3 protein is the biologically active form, and the inactive 68–70-kDa species arises as a result of differential internal translational initiation (25Kennet S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, as opposed to direct promoter repression, Sp3-derived 68–70-kDa species can bind GC elements and thus act as inhibitors of Sp1-mediated gene activation (25Kennet S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). EMSA analyses using Sp3 antibody on the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO nuclear extracts indicated the depletion of a high mobility complex but not the low mobility complex (Fig. 3 a, lanes 5 and10). However, this low mobility complex was depleted when preincubated with Sp1 antibody (Fig. 3 a, lanes 6 and11). Consequently, 5-azaC treatment of MCF-7L and GEO cells leads to enhanced Sp1 activity but decreased Sp3 activity. We have previously reported that Sp3 binds to RI and RII promoters and acts as a transcriptional repressor in MCF-7L and GEO cells (24Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3348-3352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The decreased Sp3 activity in the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells was also reflected in the Southwestern analysis, in which decreased Sp3 binding to native RI and RII promoters was observed (Figs. 4 and 5). This resulted in enhanced RI and RII expression (Fig. 1). We observed the binding of 95–100-kDa protein species to RI and RII promoters in the control and 5-azaC-treated cells. However, these protein species were not influenced by 5-azaC treatment, thus suggesting the selectivity of 5-azaC effects on Sp3. Sp3 was also reported to repress the Sp1-mediated transcription of several genes (19Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 20Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 21Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J. Odgren P.R. Last T.J. Suske G. Stein G.S. Stein J.L.

However, Sp3 was able to trans-activate c-fos and c-myc promoters (28Udvadia A.-J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3953-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Consequently, availability of specific co-activators, co-repressors, or other transcription factors may determine whether Sp3 activates or inhibits transcription of a specific gene. It was previously reported that Sp3 could repress the activity of multiple Sp1 sites contained in the dihydrofolate reductase promoter but not the single Sp1 site contained in the thymidine kinase promoter (21Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J. Odgren P.R. Last T.J. Suske G. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16503-16508Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, Sp3 effects may also depend on the context and/or the number of Sp1 binding sites. 5-AzaC treatment of MCF-7L and GEO cells increased Sp1 protein levels as a result of increased Sp1 protein stability. However, it did not affect Sp1 transcription because the Sp1 mRNA levels remained the same in control and 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells (14Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.-J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16527-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Periyasamy S. Ammanamanchi S. Tillekeratne M.P.M. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4660-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Sp3 mRNA levels were down-regulated in the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells (Fig. 6). The actin mRNA levels were not affected, thus confirming the selectivity of 5-azaC effects on Sp3. The decreased Sp3 mRNA levels in the 5-azaC-treated cells was a result of decreased Sp3 transcription in the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells (Fig. 7). The inhibition of DNA methylation following 5-azaC treatment is generally associated with enhanced expression of target genes. However, it is interesting to note that we have observed a down-regulation of Sp3 expression in the 5-azaC-treated MCF-7L and GEO cells. We would expect to see an increase in the Sp3 expression levels if the 5-azaC was directly affecting Sp3 promoter or enhancing the activity of a transcription factor required for Sp3 transcription. In contrast, if 5-azaC activates the transcription of a repressor molecule of Sp3 promoter, we would expect to see the down-regulation of Sp3 mRNA levels. The Sp3 promoter, like the Sp1 promoter, has not been cloned and hence is not available to characterize the 5-azaC affects on Sp3 promoter. Overall, the previous and present 5-azaC studies on MCF-7L breast and GEO colon cancer cells suggest that 5-azaC treatment increases Sp1 protein levels (14Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.-J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16527-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Periyasamy S. Ammanamanchi S. Tillekeratne M.P.M. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4660-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) but decreases Sp3 protein levels (Fig. 2), leading to RI and RII transcription in these cells. The constitutive Sp3 expression under the control of a CMV promoter (CMV-Sp3 cDNA) blocked the 5-azaC-mediated RI and RII induction in MCF-7L cells (Fig. 8). This indicated that 5-azaC could affect the endogenous Sp3 expression but not ectopic Sp3 expression, which was under the control of a CMV promoter (Fig. 9). Moreover, the data further confirm that 5-azaC-mediated Sp3 down-regulation is required for RI and RII induction in MCF-7L cells. Consequently, transcriptional control of TGF-β receptor expression is dependent upon the Sp1/Sp3 protein levels/activities and cancer cells can gain a growth advantage by favoring receptor repression through a combination of reduced Sp1 and elevated Sp3 expression.

Despite this homology, however, the mouse cDNA does not complement the phenotype of a yeast strain in which the VMA16 gene has been disrupted. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the 21-kDa subunit is expressed in most tissues examined and showed an expression pattern almost identical to that of the 16-kDa proteolipid subunit (subunit c). The presence of multiple mRNA species suggests the existence of alternatively spliced forms of the 21-kDa subunit which, from Southern blot analysis, are derived from a single gene. Promoter analysis using the luciferase reporter gene revealed that a region 186 bases upstream of the initiation site is sufficient to show a low level of transcriptional activity but that transcription is significantly enhanced by inclusion of the region −186 to −706.

Of the five V0 subunits, three (subunits c, c′, and c′′) are highly hydrophobic proteins termed proteolipids because of their ability to be extracted with organic solvents (27Arai H. Berne M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11006-11011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subunits c and c′ are both 16 kDa and are encoded by the VMA3 andVMA11 genes in yeast (28Nelson H. Nelson N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

All three proteins are homologous to each other and to subunit c of the F-ATPase, although they contain different numbers of putative transmembrane segments. Subunits c and c′ of the V-ATPase contain four putative transmembrane helices and appear to have arisen by gene duplication and fusion of the gene encoding the F-ATPase subunit c (26Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2000; 203: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subunit c′′ (Vma16p) contains an additional putative transmembrane helix at the amino terminus (31Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Each of the proteolipid subunits contains an essential buried carboxyl group that is critical for proton transport (31Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For the F-ATPase c subunit, this critical carboxyl group is in TM2 (15Fillingame R.H. Jiang W. Dmitriev O.Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) whereas for subunits c and c′ of the V-ATPase, the critical residue is located in TM4. Subunit c′′ contains an essential glutamic acid residue in TM3 (31Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Mutation of any of these sites completely abolishes proton transport by the V-ATPase, indicating that each V-ATPase complex must contain at least one copy of each of the proteolipid subunits (31Hirata R.

In mammalian cells, a homologue of Vma3p has been identified in mouse (32Hanada H. Hasebe M. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), bovine (26Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1991; 88: 4289-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and recently a homologue of Vma16p (the 21-kDa c′′ subunit) has been identified in human (34Nishigori H. Yamada S. Tomura H. Fernald A.A. Le Beau M.M. Takeuchi T. Takeda J. Genomics. 1998; 50: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), although little information concerning this protein has been reported. In this paper, we report the sequence of the mouse Vma16p homologue and demonstrate that its expression pattern and intracellular localization are similar to that of the 16-kDa proteolipid subunit, consistent with its function as a subunit of the V0 domain. Unlike subunit c, however, subunit c′′ appears to have a different orientation in the membrane. The possible functional significance of this difference is discussed. Escherichia coli culture media was purchased from Difco Laboratories. Minimal essential medium, fetal bovine serum, and other reagents for tissue culture were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and other molecular biology reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc., Promega, and New England Biolabs. Most other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The cDNA encoding the mouse Vma16p homologue (21 kDa subunit) was identified in the expression sequence tag (EST) data base and EST clone number AA018009was obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cDNA encoding the mouse Vma3p homologue (16-kDa subunit) (EST clone number AA791459) was also obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Yeast cells lacking the functional endogenousVMA16 gene were made from YPH500 (MATαura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1) by replacing the coding region of the VMA16 gene with the TRP1gene. The yeast VMA16 gene was integrated into theXbaI and EcoRI site of the pRS413 vector for expression. The mouse 21-kDa subunit gene was inserted just downstream of the VPH1 gene promoter and integrated into the 2-μm vector, YEp352. Cells were transformed with the plasmids pRS413, pRS413-VMA16, and YEp352–21K using the lithium acetate method and selected on SD histidine or uracil minus plates. Growth phenotypes of the transformants were assessed on YPD plates buffered with 50 mm KH2PO4 or 50 mm succinic acid to either pH 7.5 or 5.5. Membranes containing mRNAs derived from multiple mouse tissues were purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). AnEcoRI-BglII region (−97 to 573 bp, with +1 the first base of the translation initiation codon) of EST clone AA018009and a PvuII-PvuII region (555 to 978 bp) ofAA791459 were ligated into pBluescript SK (Stratagene). Radiolabeled RNA probes were synthesized by T3 RNA polymerase from the plasmid constructs described above using the Strip-EZ RNA probe synthesis kit (Ambion). Hybridization was performed overnight by incubation at 65 °C using the Northern Max system (Ambion). Membranes were washed with 15 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0), and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min. Hybridized bands were visualized by exposing to x-ray film for overnight to 3 days. RT-PCR was performed using cDNA prepared from different developmental stages of mouse embryos and the following subunit specific primers: 16Fw, CTGCTTGCAGACATGGCTGACATC; 16Rv, GTCAGGCTGTTCGTTCTGGAATGAGGAG; 21Fw, GCTGCCATGACGGGGCTGGAGTTGCTCTAC; 21Rv, GCTGAGGGACACAGCTCCAGCTGTCCCAGG. To determine the transcription initiation site for each proteolipid gene, 5′-RACE was performed using the First-Choice RACE Kit (Ambion) and the SMART cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). Reactions were performed using the manufacturers recommended protocol and mouse heart poly(A) RNA was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Amplified fragments were cloned into the TOPO-pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Primers specific for the gene encoding the 21-kDa subunit (Rv1 and Rv2) that were used for amplification are indicated in Fig.1 a. Primers used for amplification of the 16-kDa subunit gene were: 16-Rv2, GAGGCGCCCATGACACCGAAAAACGAAG, and 16-Rv2, CTTGATGTCAGCCATGTCTGCAAGCAG. Mouse genomic DNA was purchased fromCLONTECH. 10 μg of genomic DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases (EcoRI, BamHI,HindIII, and PstI) overnight and separated using a 0.9% agarose gel. DNA was transferred to the Immobilon-Ny+ membrane (Millipore, MA). Hybridization was performed using the same protocol as described in Northern blot analysis except that hybridization was performed at 55 °C. The genes encoding the mouse 21- and 16-kDa proteolipid subunits were isolated from mouse genomic DNA using the mouse genome walking kit fromCLONTECH and the manufacturers recommended protocol. Primers specific for the 21- and 16-kDa subunit genes are as follows: 21-Fw1, GCTGCCATGACGGGGCTGGAGTTGCTCTAC; 21-Rv1, GCTGAGGGACACAGCTCCAGCTGTCCCAGG; 21-Rv4, CAAAGATCCCGAGGTAGAGCAACTCCAG; 21-Rv5, GAGGCGCCCATGACACCGAAAAACGAAG; 16-Fw7, GTTCGAGAAGACGACTGCCTGGAGCTG; 16-Fw8, CGAAGACCCAGGCAAGGCTGAGCGTTG; 16-Fw10, TTGCCCTGATCTCCGACAGTGTCCCTG; 16-Rv1, GTCAGGCTGTTCGTTCTGGAATGAGGAG. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The 5′-upstream region of 21- or 16-kDa subunit genes was subcloned into the BglII andNcoI sites located upstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). Expression plasmids (0.2 μg DNA) were transfected into NIH3T3 cells (1 × 105 cells per well on 12-well plates) using the Effecten transfection reagent (Qiagen). All cells also received 0.05 μg of the pRL-TK plasmid. After 24 h, cells were lysed with Passive Lysis buffer (Promega) and luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer and the Dual Luciferase reporter system (Promega). Myc and HA epitope tags were introduced into the COOH-terminal end of the 21- and 16-kDa subunits, respectively, by PCR using the following primers: 21-Fw-Xba, 5′-CCGTCTAGAGCCACCATGACGGGGCTGGAGTTGC-3′; 21-Rv-myc, 5′-CCCTTGCGGCCGCTACAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCGTCACCCATCTTCACTCTGGA-3′; 16-Fw-HA, 5′-GGTAGGCTAGCCACCATGGCTGACATCAAGAACAAC-3′; 16-Rv-HA, 5′-ATCGATAAGCTTACTAGGCGTAGTCGGGCACGTCGTAGGGGTACTTTGTGGAGAGGATTA-3′. An HA epitope tag was also introduced into the COOH terminus of the 21-kDa subunit using the 21-Fw-Xba primer and a 21-Rv-HA primer, 5′-CCCTTGCGGCCGCTAGGCGTAGTCGGGCACGTCGTAGGGGTAGTCACCCATCTTCACTCT-3′. Amplified fragments were digested with XbaI andNotI (21-kDa subunit) or NheI andEcoRI (16-kDa subunit) and then introduced into theXbaI and NotI sites or NheI andEcoRI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen) or pIRES (CLONTECH). For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were grown on coverslips and transfected using the Effecten transfection reagent (Qiagen). After 36–48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. For selective permeabilization, cells were treated for 15 min at 4 °C with 0.1% Triton X-100 to expose both cytoplasmic and lumenal sites or 5 μg/ml digitonin to expose only cytoplasmic sites. After blocking with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in the same solution as follows: the anti-HA antibody was diluted 1:250; the anti-A subunit antibody was diluted 1:10; the anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were diluted 1:200. The cDNA sequence of the 21-kDa subunit c′′ of the V-ATPase (Vma16p) was first reported in yeast (30Apperson M. Jensen R.E. Suda K. Witte C. Yaffe M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 31Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and more recently in Caenorhabditis elegans (VHA4) (35Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24387-24392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and human (ATP6F) (34Nishigori H. Yamada S. Tomura H. Fernald A.A. Le Beau M.M. Takeuchi T. Takeda J. Genomics. 1998; 50: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A search of the mouse EST (expression sequence tag) data base revealed several clones possessing significant homology with Vma16p. One of these clones (AA18009) was completely sequenced and the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 1 a. The protein encoded contains 205 amino acid residues and has a predicted molecular mass of 21,606. The overall identity (and similarity) to human ATP6F (34Nishigori H. Yamada S. Tomura H. Fernald A.A. Le Beau M.M. Takeuchi T. Takeda J. Genomics. 1998; 50: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar),C. elegans VHA4 (35Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24387-24392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and yeast Vma16p (30Apperson M. Jensen R.E. Suda K. Witte C. Yaffe M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) is 96 (97), 58 (72), and 48% (64), respectively. This result suggests that cloneAA018009 encodes the mouse homologue of the 21-kDa subunit c′′ of the V-ATPase. Comparison of the amino acid sequence between species revealed that the predicted transmembrane regions are highly conserved, with the exception of TM1, which shows significant homology only between mouse and human (Fig. 1 b). A glutamate residue present in TM3 (shown by the asterisk in Fig. 1 b) was observed to be essential for V-ATPase activity in yeast (31Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and is conserved in all four species. To analyze the function of the mouse 21-kDa subunit, we expressed the mouse 21-kDa subunit in yeast cells lacking the endogenous VMA16 gene. Despite the relatively high identity and similarity between the mouse 21-kDa subunit and the yeast Vma16p (48 and 64%, respectively), the mouse 21-kDa subunit did not complement the growth defect at pH 7.5 of the VMA16deletion strain (Fig. 2). In addition to Vma16p, V-ATPase activity in yeast requires two additional proteolipid subunits (Vma3p and Vma11p), both of which have a molecular mass of ∼16 kDa and contain four putative transmembrane helices (28Nelson H. Nelson N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,29Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24526-24532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding the mouse homologue of the 16-kDa Vma3p has previously been reported (32Hanada H. Hasebe M. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To compare the expression pattern of these two proteolipid subunits in mouse, Northern blot analysis was performed on mRNA isolated from various mouse tissues using RNA probes specific for each subunit. As shown in Fig.3 a, transcripts encoding the 21-kDa subunit were detected in all tissues, with the highest expression detected in heart, brain, liver, kidney, and testis. The signals observed for both proteolipids in skeletal muscle was very low, but this is consistent with the intensity of the band for β-actin. The pattern of expression of the 21-kDa subunit generally paralleled that observed for the 16-kDa subunit. Interestingly, two different size bands were detected by Northern blot in all tissues tested using the probe specific for the 21-kDa subunit (Fig. 3 a). The size of the lower band matched that predicted for clone AA018009. This result suggests the existence of alternatively spliced forms of this message. The expression of the 21- and 16-kDa subunits at various developmental stages was also investigated (Fig. 3 b), with mRNA for both subunits detectable at all stages tested. It was previously reported that there exist several pseudogenes for the 16-kDa subunit in both human (36Hasebe M. Hanada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and mouse (37Inoue H. Noumi T. Nagata M. Murakami H. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To test whether this was also the case for the 21-kDa subunit and to determine whether the two bands observed for the 21-kDa subunit by Northern blot correspond to alternatively spliced variants of a single gene, Southern blot analysis was performed on mouse genomic DNA digested using several different restriction enzymes. As can be seen in Fig.4, a single band was observed for each of the restriction digests with the exception of PstI (see below). This result suggests that the 21-kDa subunit is encoded by a single gene in mouse, without the presence of pseudogenes. The gene encoding the mouse 21-kDa subunit was isolated from mouse genomic DNA by PCR genomic walking and was sequenced. As shown in Fig.5 a, the 21-kDa subunit gene contained eight exons and seven introns, with the exon/intron organization the same as that observed in human (34Nishigori H. Yamada S. Tomura H. Fernald A.A. Le Beau M.M. Takeuchi T. Takeda J. Genomics. 1998; 50: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). TwoPstI sites are present in the 21-kDa subunit gene, consistent with the multiple bands observed following PstI digestion by Southern blot. The gene encoding the mouse 16-kDa subunit was also isolated and shown to contain three exons and two introns (Fig. 5), consistent with a recent report (37Inoue H. Noumi T. Nagata M. Murakami H. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All exon/intron boundaries were observed to follow the GT/AG rule (Fig.5 b). Because Northern blotting indicated that genes encoding the 16- and 21-kDa subunits were expressed in a similar tissue-specific pattern, it appeared possible that transcription of the two genes might be regulated in a similar manner (62Nishi T. Kubo K. Hasebe M. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 922-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To test this, 5′-upstream regions of different lengths from both genes were ligated upstream of the luciferase reporter gene and the constructs transfected together with a control reporter plasmid (pRL-TK) into NIH3T3 cells followed by measurement of luciferase activity using a dual assay system. The SV40 promoter and enhancer were used as a positive control (pGL3-control) whereas the luciferase gene lacking promoter and enhancer sequences was used as a negative control (pGL3-basic). As shown in Fig.6, the 5′-upstream regions of both the 16- and 21-kDa subunit genes showed significant promoter activity compared with the positive control. In addition, full promoter activity was observed for 5′-upstream regions as short as −670 bp (16-kDa subunit gene) and −706 bp (21-kDa subunit gene), whereas promoter activity decreased sharply upon further reduction of the 5′-upstream length to −187 and −186 bp, respectively. Interestingly the basal transcriptional activity of the constructs containing the first 187 bp of 5′-upsteam sequence was the same for both genes (13%), suggesting that common elements contribute to this basal activity. Nevertheless, additional sequences between −186 and −706 bp greatly enhance promoter activity. Comparison of the 5′-upstream sequences for these two genes in this region (Fig. 7) reveals the lack of significant sequence homology and the absence of a typical TATA box. However, several putative transcription initiation factor-binding sites, including GC boxes and a CCAAT box, were identified.Figure 7Promoter regions of the 21- and 16-kDa subunit genes. Shown are the 5′-upsteam regions of the 21- and 16-kDa subunit genes, with identical bases indicated byshading, GC boxes indicated by wavy lines, and a CCAAT box shown with a straight line. The transcription initiation sites for each gene as determined by 5′-RACE are indicated by the closed circles (21-kDa subunit gene) and open circles (16-kDa subunit gene).

To confer glucose-sensing capabilities into these cells, they were further modified with recombinant adenoviruses to express high levels of GLUT2 and the β-cell isoform of glucokinase (GK). Although expression of GLUT2 alone had negligible effects on glucose usage and lactate production, expression of GK alone resulted in ∼2-fold increase in glycolytic flux within the physiological (3–20 mm) glucose range. GLUT2/GK coexpression further increased glycolytic flux at 20 mm glucose but disproportionately increased flux at 3 mm glucose. Despite enhanced glycolytic fluxes, GLUT2/GK-coexpressing cells showed glucose dose-dependent accumulation of hexose phosphates, depletion of intracellular ATP, and severe apoptotic cell death. These studies demonstrate that glucose-sensing properties can be introduced into non-islet cells by the single expression of GK and that glucose responsiveness can be augmented by the coexpression of GLUT2. However, in the metabolic engineering of surrogate β cells, it is critical that the levels of the components be closely optimized to ensure their physiological function and to avoid the deleterious consequences of glucose-induced toxicity.

Despite recent advances in insulin injection therapy, current regimens do not adequately mimic the normal physiological patterns of insulin release by β cells, and patients with diabetes are thus at continued risk for developing severe long-term complications. These limitations have provided the impetus to develop alternative forms of therapy that would circumvent the need for insulin injections.One appealing therapeutic strategy is to engineer insulin expression into non-β cells (1Lipes M.A. Cooper E.M.

Using transgenic mouse techniques, we targeted mouse preproinsulin 2 (ins) gene expression to the intermediate lobe (IL) of the pituitary in NOD mice via the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) promoter (1Lipes M.A. Cooper E.M. Skelly R. Rhodes C.J. Boschetti E. Weir G.C. Davalli A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8595-8600Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our studies showed that the IL cells secreted large amounts of insulin, sufficient to cure diabetes when implanted into spontaneously diabetic NOD mice. Moreover, in contrast to transplanted islets, the insulin-producing IL (hereafter, ILins) cells evaded immune recognition and damage. These studies were the first to show that a non-islet cell type could be engineered to secrete sufficient amounts of insulin to cure diabetes, yet escape the autoimmune process that kills β cells in type 1 diabetes (1Lipes M.A. Cooper E.M.

However, a limitation of this insulin gene delivery system was that insulin secretion was not glucose-regulated.The regulation of insulin release in β cells is mediated by the metabolism of glucose (4Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). According to current models, glucose metabolism generates signals such as ATP or an increase in the ratio of ATP to ADP ratio that leads to closure of the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. The resulting plasma membrane depolarization activates voltage-gated L-type Ca2+channels, inducing the influx of Ca2 that triggers insulin granule exocytosis (5Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The proteins that control the metabolic flux of glucose in β cells function as “glucose sensors.” Rodent β cells express two specialized proteins that have been considered as candidates for the glucose sensor: the facilitated glucose transporter isoform, GLUT2, and the low affinity glucose phosphorylating enzyme, glucokinase (GK). A large body of evidence suggests that GK is the flux-controlling enzyme for glycolysis in β cells and, as such, serves as the “gatekeeper” for metabolic signaling (4Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M.

GK is unique among mammalian hexokinases in having a Kmfor glucose in the physiological (8–10 mm) glucose range (6Trus M.D. Zawalich W.S. Burch P.T. Berner D.K. Weill V.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1981; 30: 911-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high capacity glucose transporter, GLUT2, is also unique in having a high Km (∼17 mm) for glucose (7Thorens B. Deriaz N. Bosco D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8075-8081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) but is believed to play a more “permissive” role in glucose sensing by allowing the rapid equilibration of glucose across the plasma membrane (8Sweet I.R. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, several studies have suggested that the expression of GLUT2 is required for conferring glucose-sensing capabilities into non-β cell lines (9Hughes S.D. Johnson J.H. Quaade C. Newgard C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Motoyoshi S. Shirotani T. Araki E. Sakai K. Kaneko K. Motoshima H. Yoshizato K. Shirakami A. Kishikawa H. Shichiri M. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been observed that GLUT2 and GK are coexpressed not only in β cells and hepatocytes but also in glucose-responsive neurons in the hypothalamus and the gut (11Schuit F.C. Huypens P. Heimberg H. Pipeleers D.G. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), further suggesting that GLUT2 may be an important component of the glucose-sensing apparatus in non-islet cells.It has been suggested that the simple “iterative engineering” of glucose-sensing components into cells or cell lines may simulate the performance of normal islet β cells (12Clark S.A. Quade C. Constandy H. Hansen P. Halban P. Ferber S. Newgard C.B. Normington K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 958-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to determine whether the expression of GK or GLUT2, alone or in combination, would confer glucose-sensing capabilities into ILins cells. We found that the single expression of GK conferred glucose-sensing capabilities in the physiological glucose concentration range and that glycolytic flux was increased by the coexpression of GLUT2. However, unexpectedly, these manipulations also resulted in a state of glucose-induced toxicity with severe apoptotic cell death. These findings have important implications for future strategies to metabolically engineer surrogate β cells.DISCUSSIONWe demonstrate that ILins cells can be engineered to express extremely high levels of functional GK and GLUT2 proteins. The expression of GLUT2 alone enhanced glucose usage only at very low glucose concentrations (i.e. 0.3 mm glucose), similar to a previous report (26Morita H. Yano Y. Niswender K.D. May J.M. Whitesell R.R. Wu L. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. Magnuson M.A. Powers A.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast, the single expression of GK in ILins cells increased glucose usage and lactate production in the physiological glucose range with a 2-fold increase from 3 to 20 mm glucose, relative to control cells (p < 0.001). These results are consistent with the known regulation of GK enzyme activity that occurs over the same glucose range. The coexpression of GLUT2 and GK further increased glucose usage at 20 mm glucose, but unexpectedly, this was accompanied by a leftward shift in the glucose dose-response curve with disproportionately greater glycolytic flux at 3 mm glucose. Despite the stimulation of glycolysis in these engineered cells, insulin secretion was reduced with a pronounced accumulation of hexose phosphates, depletion of ATP, and apoptotic cell death.Why did glycolysis and energy production go awry in these metabolically engineered cells? One factor may relate to the inherent organization of the glycolytic pathway. The term “turbo design” has been coined to describe the organization of many catabolic pathways that begin with one or more ATP-consuming steps, after which further metabolism and ATP-generating reactions yield a net production of ATP across the pathway (27Teusink B. Walsh M.C. van Dam K. Westerhoff H.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 162-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Turbo design is exemplified in glycolysis, in which two molecules of ATP are initially invested at the hexokinase (HK) and phosphofructokinase (PFK) steps as a prelude to the net synthesis of four molecules of ATP further down the pathway. This design feature makes tight regulation of the enzymes involved in the initial ATP-consuming steps absolutely essential (27Teusink B. Walsh M.C. van Dam K. Westerhoff H.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 162-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells the activity of HK is inhibited by its product, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). However, GK is not subject to such feedback inhibition. Therefore, when GK is expressed at high levels, there is the risk of uncontrolled accumulation of G6P, especially at high glucose levels. In addition, because G6P is in equilibrium with fructose 6-phosphate, the fructose 6-phosphate would be expected to rise and increase flux through PFK.In these studies, the levels of F1,6BP were ∼5-fold higher than those of G6P but otherwise showed similar patterns of accumulation. A number of factors may contribute to the preferential accumulation of F1,6BP. First, PFK would be expected to be activated allosterically by the consumption of its inhibitor ATP (and presumably, the corresponding rise in the PFK activator AMP) during glucose phosphorylation. Second, because the product of the PFK reaction, F1,6BP, is itself a potent allosteric activator of PFK, the rise in F1,6BP levels may be autocatalytic. Third, because F1,6BP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate form an equilibrium pool through the rapid aldolase and triose phosphate isomerase reactions, the F1,6BP concentration varies as the square of the GAP concentration (28Tornheim K. J. Theor. Biol. 1979; 79: 491-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), so there may be a disproportionate rise in F1,6BP as glycolytic flux increases. Finally, as more F1,6BP and GAP accumulate, the GAP concentration may approach or surpass the Km of GAPDH, further diminishing the responsiveness of GAPDH to the increased metabolic flux. It should be noted that the maximum accumulated F1,6BP is equivalent to only about 7% of the glucose utilization (or the lactate production), suggesting that there may not be a major block at the reaction catalyzed by GAPDH. However, accumulated F1,6BP is equivalent to nearly twice the normal level of intracellular ATP, and therefore, the sequestration of phosphate in F1,6BP and G6P likely accounts for the drop in cellular ATP levels. Admittedly, our measurements of these metabolites were at the end of 1 h of incubation, and it is possible that these changes did not occur at a constant rate but that the rise in F1,6BP and loss of ATP occurred more acutely toward the end of the incubation period such that phosphate depletion did inhibit the flow through GAPDH (which uses Pias a substrate) and the glycolytic ATP production. Regardless of the exact timing, it is likely that the sequestration of phosphate in G6P and F1,6BP accounts for the ATP depletion and loss of cell viability.It has been suggested that the reason why GK is not hazardous to cell types where it is normally expressed, such as β cells and hepatocytes, is that in the former, GK activity is the lowest of the activities of all glycolytic enzymes and, as such, constitutes the “rate-limiting” step of glycolysis (29Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: E1-E13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); whereas in hepatocytes, GK is subject to a number of regulatory influences, including the GK regulatory protein. Furthermore, hepatocytes have additional reactions (e.g. glucose cycling through glucose-6-phosphatase and glycogen synthesis) that may prevent the excessive accumulation of glycolytic intermediates (30Iynedjian P.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 467-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).A striking feature of the cells that coexpressed GLUT2 and GK was the leftward shift in their glucose-response threshold with a disproportionate increase in glycolytic flux at 3 mmglucose. These findings were unexpected in view of the highKm of GLUT2 and GK and could not be predicted from studying the metabolic impact of each gene individually. A simple explanation is that when GK is expressed alone, endogenous GLUT1 limits the flux of glucose through the cells; but when GLUT2 and GK are coexpressed, neither transport nor phosphorylation is rate-limiting. However, it seems unlikely that glucose transport is rate-limiting, because even in LacZ-infected cells uptake at 3 mm glucose was ∼2-fold higher than the glucose usage in cells coexpressing GLUT2 and GK (10.2 ± 0.9 versus5.6 ± 0.4 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively). These data suggest that in this setting there may be a direct interaction between GLUT2 and GK (31Hughes S.D. Quaade C. Johnson J.H. Ferber S. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15205-15212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or, more likely, in combination they may affect the activities of other components involved in the upper part of the glycolytic pathway (32Malaisse W.J. Bodur H. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Similar metabolic perturbations, i.e. activation of the first steps of glycolysis with the accumulation of hexose phosphates and loss of ATP, have been reported in several other systems. These include Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast mutants that are unable to synthesize the HK inhibitor trehalose 6-phosphate (27Teusink B. Walsh M.C. van Dam K. Westerhoff H.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 162-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), trypanosomes in which glycolysis is not compartmentalized (33Bakker B.M. Mensonides F.I. Teusink B. van Hoek P. Michels P.A. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), healthy subjects who received high doses of parenteral fructose, which is phosphorylated by fructokinase that bypasses the regulated HK step (34Gitzelman R. Steinman B. Van den Bergue G. Scriver C.R. Baudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, Inc., New York1995: 904-934Google Scholar), and the INS-1 β-cell line that was engineered to overexpress large amounts of GK (35Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25731-25736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 36Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the latter setting, control of glycolysis at the GK step was also lost, with a marked increase in glucose usage at low (2.5 mm) glucose concentrations. These effects were attributed to high level GK expression alone (35Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25731-25736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but our findings raise the possibility that the endogenous GLUT2 may have also adversely contributed to this phenotype.Another remarkable feature of GLUT2- and GK-coexpressing cells was that, despite exhibiting an acute 80% drop in intracellular ATP levels at high glucose levels, these cells showed pronounced amounts of apoptotic cell death. These findings were unexpected, because apoptosis is an energyrequiring process and progression to necrotic or apoptotic cell death is thought to depend in part on the cellular ATP content, with rapid ATP depletion usually resulting in necrosis (37Raff M. Nature. 1998; 396: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that, although the ATP levels in GLUT2/GK-coexpressing cells are severely reduced, these ATP levels are still sufficient to complete the apoptotic program. Recent studies have suggested that glucose may induce apoptosis in pancreatic β cells (38Efanova I. Zaitsev S. Zhivotovsky B. Kohler M. Efendic S. Orrenius S. Berggren P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33501-33507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 39Federici M. Hribal M. Perego L. Ranalli M. Caradonna Z. Perego C. Usellini L. Nano R. Bonini P.

Although caution must be used against extrapolating our data to islets, these findings suggest that GLUT2 and GK may be involved in a glucose signaling pathway that, when imbalanced, results in metabolic toxicity and apoptotic cell death.It has been suggested that the simple introduction of glucose-sensing components into cells or cell lines may simulate the performance of normal islet β cells. These findings raise important caveats to this notion and demonstrate the deleterious consequences that can result when the expression levels of the metabolic components are not closely optimized. We must emphasize that the metabolic toxicity described in this report was not due to the high level expression achieved with this particular viral gene delivery system. We have recently created a series of transgenic mouse lines that coexpress GLUT2 and GK in IL cells at levels that are markedly lower than those achieved with adenoviruses. Interestingly, the size of the IL tissues in these transgenic mice corresponded inversely to the levels of GK expression, with the most severe reduction in the size of the IL tissues in the lines that expressed the highest levels of GK. 2R. N. Faradji, E. Havari, Q. Chen, and M. A. Lipes, manuscript in preparation. Although the mechanism by which glucose stimulates insulin secretion in β cells is complex and clearly requires more than just the expression of GLUT2 and GK, these transgenic tissues should provide an excellent starting material for determining the requirements for optimal glucose-sensing in surrogate β cells. Type 1 diabetes in humans and in nonobese diabetic (NOD)1 mice is an autoimmune disorder that results in the complete destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic β cells. Despite recent advances in insulin injection therapy, current regimens do not adequately mimic the normal physiological patterns of insulin release by β cells, and patients with diabetes are thus at continued risk for developing severe long-term complications. These limitations have provided the impetus to develop alternative forms of therapy that would circumvent the need for insulin injections. One appealing therapeutic strategy is to engineer insulin expression into non-β cells (1Lipes M.A. Cooper E.M. Skelly R. Rhodes C.J. Boschetti E. Weir G.C. Davalli A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using transgenic mouse techniques, we targeted mouse preproinsulin 2 (ins) gene expression to the intermediate lobe (IL) of the pituitary in NOD mice via the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) promoter (1Lipes M.A. Cooper E.M. Skelly R. Rhodes C.J. Boschetti E. Weir G.C. Davalli A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8595-8600Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our studies showed that the IL cells secreted large amounts of insulin, sufficient to cure diabetes when implanted into spontaneously diabetic NOD mice. Moreover, in contrast to transplanted islets, the insulin-producing IL (hereafter, ILins) cells evaded immune recognition and damage. These studies were the first to show that a non-islet cell type could be engineered to secrete sufficient amounts of insulin to cure diabetes, yet escape the autoimmune process that kills β cells in type 1 diabetes (1Lipes M.A. Cooper E.M. Skelly R. Rhodes C.J. Boschetti E. Weir G.C. Davalli A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8595-8600Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, a limitation of this insulin gene delivery system was that insulin secretion was not glucose-regulated. The regulation of insulin release in β cells is mediated by the metabolism of glucose (4Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). According to current models, glucose metabolism generates signals such as ATP or an increase in the ratio of ATP to ADP ratio that leads to closure of the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. The resulting plasma membrane depolarization activates voltage-gated L-type Ca2+channels, inducing the influx of Ca2 that triggers insulin granule exocytosis (5Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The proteins that control the metabolic flux of glucose in β cells function as “glucose sensors.” Rodent β cells express two specialized proteins that have been considered as candidates for the glucose sensor: the facilitated glucose transporter isoform, GLUT2, and the low affinity glucose phosphorylating enzyme, glucokinase (GK). A large body of evidence suggests that GK is the flux-controlling enzyme for glycolysis in β cells and, as such, serves as the “gatekeeper” for metabolic signaling (4Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). GK is unique among mammalian hexokinases in having a Kmfor glucose in the physiological (8–10 mm) glucose range (6Trus M.D. Zawalich W.S. Burch P.T. Berner D.K. Weill V.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1981; 30: 911-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high capacity glucose transporter, GLUT2, is also unique in having a high Km (∼17 mm) for glucose (7Thorens B. Deriaz N. Bosco D. DeVos A. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. Meda P. Porret A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8075-8081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) but is believed to play a more “permissive” role in glucose sensing by allowing the rapid equilibration of glucose across the plasma membrane (8Sweet I.R.

However, several studies have suggested that the expression of GLUT2 is required for conferring glucose-sensing capabilities into non-β cell lines (9Hughes S.D. Johnson J.H. Quaade C. Newgard C.B.

In addition, it has been observed that GLUT2 and GK are coexpressed not only in β cells and hepatocytes but also in glucose-responsive neurons in the hypothalamus and the gut (11Schuit F.C. Huypens P. Heimberg H. Pipeleers D.G.

It has been suggested that the simple “iterative engineering” of glucose-sensing components into cells or cell lines may simulate the performance of normal islet β cells (12Clark S.A. Quade C. Constandy H. Hansen P. Halban P. Ferber S. Newgard C.B. Normington K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 958-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to determine whether the expression of GK or GLUT2, alone or in combination, would confer glucose-sensing capabilities into ILins cells. We found that the single expression of GK conferred glucose-sensing capabilities in the physiological glucose concentration range and that glycolytic flux was increased by the coexpression of GLUT2. However, unexpectedly, these manipulations also resulted in a state of glucose-induced toxicity with severe apoptotic cell death. These findings have important implications for future strategies to metabolically engineer surrogate β cells. DISCUSSIONWe demonstrate that ILins cells can be engineered to express extremely high levels of functional GK and GLUT2 proteins. The expression of GLUT2 alone enhanced glucose usage only at very low glucose concentrations (i.e. 0.3 mm glucose), similar to a previous report (26Morita H. Yano Y. Niswender K.D. May J.M. Whitesell R.R. Wu L. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. Magnuson M.A. Powers A.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast, the single expression of GK in ILins cells increased glucose usage and lactate production in the physiological glucose range with a 2-fold increase from 3 to 20 mm glucose, relative to control cells (p < 0.001). These results are consistent with the known regulation of GK enzyme activity that occurs over the same glucose range. The coexpression of GLUT2 and GK further increased glucose usage at 20 mm glucose, but unexpectedly, this was accompanied by a leftward shift in the glucose dose-response curve with disproportionately greater glycolytic flux at 3 mm glucose. Despite the stimulation of glycolysis in these engineered cells, insulin secretion was reduced with a pronounced accumulation of hexose phosphates, depletion of ATP, and apoptotic cell death.Why did glycolysis and energy production go awry in these metabolically engineered cells? One factor may relate to the inherent organization of the glycolytic pathway. The term “turbo design” has been coined to describe the organization of many catabolic pathways that begin with one or more ATP-consuming steps, after which further metabolism and ATP-generating reactions yield a net production of ATP across the pathway (27Teusink B. Walsh M.C. van Dam K. Westerhoff H.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 162-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Turbo design is exemplified in glycolysis, in which two molecules of ATP are initially invested at the hexokinase (HK) and phosphofructokinase (PFK) steps as a prelude to the net synthesis of four molecules of ATP further down the pathway. This design feature makes tight regulation of the enzymes involved in the initial ATP-consuming steps absolutely essential (27Teusink B. Walsh M.C. van Dam K. Westerhoff H.V. Trends Biochem.

The major functions of bovine cytochrome oxidase, including dioxygen reduction and proton pumping, are retained when the dimeric enzyme is converted to monomeric form (12Suarez M.D. Revzin A. Narlock R. Kempner E.S. Thompson D.A. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13791-13799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Thompson, D. A., Gregory, L., and Ferguson-Miller, S. (1985)J. Inorg. Biochem. 23357–364Google Scholar). In the present study, it has been discovered that the kinetics of compound F reduction are strongly influenced by treatments of the enzyme that traditionally have been used to convert the bovine enzyme to the monomeric form. Two different methods were used to prepare monomeric bovine cytochrome oxidase, incubation with Triton X-100 at pH 8.0 (11Robinson N.C. Talbert L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2328-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or pH 8.5 (10Georgevich G. Darley-Usmar V.M. Malatesta F. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and incubation with lauryl maltoside at pH 10.0 (15Love B. Chan S.H.P. Stotz E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6664-6668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When dimeric bovine cytochrome oxidase is incubated with Triton X-100 (10Georgevich G. Darley-Usmar V.M. Malatesta F. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Robinson N.C. Talbert L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2328-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a fast phase of compound F reduction with a rate constant of 2400 s−1 becomes dominant, and the slow phase is nearly eliminated. Furthermore, the rate constant of the fast phase is independent of pH from pH 8.0 to 10.0. Similar results were obtained by incubation at pH 10.0 with lauryl maltoside. These effects are irreversible. In both cases, the steady-state cytochrome c oxidase activity is unaffected and the enzyme is not denatured. The data indicate that the structural changes induced by these treatments of the enzyme have a specific influence on the rate of reduction of compound F, likely due to an alteration in the coupled proton transfer to the heme-copper center that is required for this step of the reaction. Bovine CcO was purified by the method of Capaldi and Hayashi (16Capaldi R.A. Hayashi H. FEBS Lett. 1972; 26: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and had a heme content of 9–11 nmol/mg of protein and a turnover number of 400 s−1. In some experiments, crystalline bovine CcO prepared as described in Ref. 17Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Iroh K. Nakashima T. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar was used, and was a generous gift from Dr. Yoshikawa. There was no significant difference in the kinetics of compound F reduction in the two CcO preparations. CcO was equilibrated with the indicated buffers and detergents using Amicon-100 concentrators prior to kinetic experiments. Lauryl maltoside was obtained from Calbiochem, and Triton X-100 and Tris-HCl were obtained from Sigma. Ru2C was a generous gift from Russell H. Schmehl (Department of Chemistry, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA), prepared as described by Baba et al.(18Baba A.I. Ensley H.E. Schmehl R.H. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 1198-1207Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Monomeric bovine cytochrome c oxidase was prepared as described by Georgevich et al. (10Georgevich G. Darley-Usmar V.M. Malatesta F. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 25 μm CcO was incubated in 320 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5) containing 5% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4 °C. The sample was then diluted 10-fold and applied to a 0.5 × 5-cm DEAE-Sepharose column that was equilibrated with 10 mmTris-Cl (pH 8.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After washing with 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, the sample was eluted with 10 mm Tris-Cl containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 200 mm NaCl. Monomeric CcO was also prepared using Triton X-100 at pH 8.0 as described by Robinson et al. (11Robinson N.C. Talbert L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2328-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The oxyferryl (F) state was prepared as described previously by incubating oxidized bovine CcO for 5 min with 4 mm hydrogen peroxide (9Zaslavsky D. Sadoski R.C. Wang K. Durham B. Gennis R.B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14910-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The ferryl state was characterized from the (F − O) difference spectrum, which has a peak at 583 nm, and a maximum at 436 nm and minimum at 414 nm in the Soret region. The concentration of oxygen intermediates was calculated using an extinction coefficient of Δε436–414 = 67 mm−1cm−1, and the amount of the enzyme converted to the ferryl intermediate was calculated using Δε583–630 = 5.3 mm−1 cm−1 (3Wikstrom M. Morgan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10266-10273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fabian M. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13802-13810Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The absorbance transients were recorded from 300-μl samples in a 1-cm glass semimicrocuvette following excitation with a 480-nm light flash of <0.5 μs in duration from a phase R model DL1400 flash lamp-pumped dye laser using coumarin LD 490. The detection system was previously described by Panet al. (19Pan L.P. Hibdon S. Liu R.-Q. Durham B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8492-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The reduction of CuA was monitored at 830 nm using Δε830 = 2.0 mm−1 cm−1 (20Blair D.F. Martin C.T. Gelles J. Wang H. Brudvig G.W. Stevens T.H. Chan S.I. Chem. Scr. 1983; 21: 43-53Google Scholar). The reaction of heme a was monitored at 605 nm using Δε605 = 16 mm−1 cm−1 (21Blair Dl. F. Bocian D.F. Babcock G.T. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6928-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and that of heme a3 was monitored at 580 nm using Δε580 = 5.3 mm−1 cm−1 (3Wikstrom M. Morgan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10266-10273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples contained 5–10 μm cytochrome c oxidase, 20 μm Ru2D, 10 mm aniline, 1 mm 3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy free radical (3-CP), and 0.1% lauryl maltoside in the appropriate buffer. Aniline and 3-CP were used as sacrificial electron donors to reduce Ru(III) and prevent the back reaction between Ru(III) and CuA(I) cytochrome c oxidase. The buffers used were 2 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0–7.5), 5 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5–8.5), and sodium borate (pH 8.5–10). A microelectrode was used to monitor the pH in the cuvette. All absorbance transients were analyzed using KINFIT kinetics program obtained from On-line Instruments Systems Inc. The absorbance spectra were obtained with a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. Sedimentation coefficients of bovine cytochrome c oxidase preparations were measured using a Beckman XL-A analytical centrifuge as described in Ref. 22Wang K. Zhen Y. Sadoski R. Grinnell S. Geren L. Ferguson-Miller S. Durham B. Millett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38042-38050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar. Samples contained 5 μm bovine cytochrome c oxidase in the appropriate buffer and detergent. The ultracentrifuge was operated in the sedimentation mode at a speed 48,000 rpm. Absorbance scans were recorded at 410 nm every 15 min. The electron transfer reaction between heme a and the binuclear center was studied by rapidly injecting a single electron from the photoexcited ruthenium dimer, Ru2C, into CuA as previously described by Zaslavsky et al. (9Zaslavsky D. Sadoski R.C. Wang K. Durham B. Gennis R.B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14910-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The rate constant for electron transfer between CuA and heme a in bovine CcO in the resting O state was (2.2 ± 0.5) × 104s−1, monitored at 605 nm and 830 nm (9Zaslavsky D. Sadoski R.C. Wang K. Durham B. Gennis R.B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14910-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). No further electron transfer from heme a to the binuclear center was observed in the resting O state. The rate constant for electron transfer from CuA to heme a was also (2.0 ± 0.5) × 104 s−1 in the F state of the enzyme. This was followed by reoxidation of heme a, monitored at 605 nm, and reduction of oxyferryl heme a3, monitored at 580 nm (Fig.1). The transients at both wavelengths were biphasic for bovine CcO in 5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8) and 0.1% lauryl maltoside. The major slow phase has a rate constant of 470 s−1 and relative amplitude of 82%, whereas the minor fast phase has a rate constant of 1500 s−1 and relative amplitude of 18%. Using the extinction coefficients given in Refs. 3Wikstrom M. Morgan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10266-10273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholarand 21Blair Dl. F. Bocian D.F. Babcock G.T. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6928-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, the reoxidation of heme a and reduction of heme a3were equimolar. The reaction between heme a and oxyferryl heme a3 is pH-dependent (9Zaslavsky D. Sadoski R.C. Wang K. Durham B. Gennis R.B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14910-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As the pH increases from pH 7.0 to pH 9.5, the rate constant of the major slow phase decreases from 590 s−1 to 220 s−1, whereas the rate constant of the minor fast phase does not change significantly (TableI, Fig. 2). However, when the enzyme is incubated for 2 h at pH 10.0 prior to formation of compound F, a major change in the kinetics is observed (Fig. 3, Table I). Electron transfer from heme a to oxyferryl heme a3 now consists of a major fast phase with a rate constant of 1650 s−1 and a minor slow phase with a rate constant of 210 s−1 and a relative amplitude of 20%. When the pH of this sample is decreased to pH 7.4, the kinetics remain essentially the same, with a major fast phase with a rate constant of 1600 s−1, and a minor slow phase with a rate constant of 400 s−1 (Table I, Fig. 2). It thus appears that the pH 10.0 incubation led to an essentially irreversible change in the kinetics of the enzyme. Since incubation at pH 10.0 has been reported to lead to conversion of dimeric CcO to monomeric CcO (15Love B. Chan S.H.P. Stotz E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6664-6668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that this change in quaternary structure, or structural changes resulting from this treatment of the enzyme, causes the change in kinetics of electron transfer from heme a to oxyferryl heme a3 in compound F.Table IKinetics of bovine CcO compound F reduction under different conditionsEnzyme preparation and detergentMeasurement conditionskfastkslowSlowpHs−1s−1%0.1% lauryl maltoside8.01,500 ± 300470 ± 7082 ± 100.1% lauryl maltoside9.52,100 ± 300220 ± 4086 ± 10Incubation at pH 10 in 0.1% lauryl maltoside10.01,650 ± 200210 ± 7020 ± 10Incubation at pH 10 in 0.1% lauryl maltoside7.41,600 ± 200400 ± 10030 ± 100.1% Triton X-1008.0450 ± 5095 ± 51% Triton X-1008.01,600 ± 250440 ± 7050 ± 15Incubation at pH 8.5 in 5% Triton X-1008.02,400 ± 300280 ± 5012 ± 7Incubation at pH 8.5 in 5% Triton X-1009.52,600 ± 300160 ± 6014 ± 10The kinetics of electron transfer from photoreduced heme a to oxyferryl heme a3 were measured as described in Figs.

The 605 nm and 580 nm transients consist of major phases with rate constants of 1650 ± 300 s−1 and 1500 ± 300 s−1, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The kinetics of electron transfer from photoreduced heme a to oxyferryl heme a3 were measured as described in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. The kinetics were further investigated in different concentrations of Triton X-100, which has also been shown to affect the quaternary state of bovine CcO (10Georgevich G. Darley-Usmar V.M. Malatesta F. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,11Robinson N.C. Talbert L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2328-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Electron transfer from heme a to oxyferryl heme a3 was monophasic for bovine CcO equilibrated with 0.1% Triton X-100, with a rate constant of 450 s−1 at pH 8.0 (Table I). This is consistent with the report by Robinson et al. (11Robinson N.C. Talbert L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2328-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that bovine CcO consists of dimers and higher aggregates at this low Triton X-100 concentration. Raising the Triton X-100 concentration to 1% resulted in biphasic electron transfer from heme a to oxyferryl heme a3 (Table I). The fast phase had a rate constant of 1600 s−1 and amplitude of 50%, and the slow phase had a rate constant of 440 s−1 and amplitude of 50%. Monomeric CcO was prepared by incubating the enzyme with 5% Triton X-100 at pH 8.5 and then exchanging the sample into 0.1% Triton X-100 as described by Georgevich et al. (10Georgevich G. Darley-Usmar V.M. Malatesta F. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Essentially the same results were obtained for a preparation incubated with 5% Triton X-100 at pH 8.0, as described by Robinson et al. (11Robinson N.C. Talbert L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2328-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Electron transfer from heme a to oxyferryl heme a3 in compound F at pH 8.0 consisted of a major fast phase with a rate constant of 2400 s−1 and relative amplitude of 89%, and a minor slow phase with a rate constant of 280 s−1 (Table I). The rate constant of the major fast phase was independent of pH from pH 8.0 to pH 10.0 (Fig. 2). The rate constant for electron transfer from CuA to heme a was (2.4 ± 0.5) × 104s−1 for the Triton X-100-treated preparation, which is the same as for the dimeric preparation in the presence of 0.1% lauryl maltoside (9Zaslavsky D. Sadoski R.C. Wang K. Durham B. Gennis R.B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14910-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). There was also no change in the equilibrium electron distribution between CuA and heme a as a result of the treatment with Triton X-100. Furthermore, the steady-state cytochromec oxidase activity was not affected by the 5% Triton X-100 treatment, when the assay was carried out in buffer containing 0.1% lauryl maltoside. The reaction between heme a and oxyferryl heme a3 in CcO incubated with Triton X-100 was also studied in 96% D2O with a pH meter reading of 7.6, which is equivalent to pD 8.0 (23Showen K.B.J. Gandor R.D. Schowen R.L. Transition States of Biochemical Processes. Plenum Press, New York1978: 225-283Crossref Google Scholar). The 605- and 580-nm transients each consist of a major phase with a rate constant of 300 s−1. This rate constant is also independent of pH from pH 8.0 to pH 9.5 (Fig.4). The major phase of electron transfer from heme a to oxyferryl heme a3 in the Triton-treated enzyme, thus, has a very substantial deuterium isotope effect of 8.0. The quaternary structure of the cytochrome c oxidase preparations was studied using sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation. The apparent sedimentation coefficient of untreated bovine CcO in 5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% lauryl maltoside was 11.7 S. The sedimentation coefficient of the CcO preparation incubated for 2 h in 0.1% lauryl maltoside at pH 10.0 in 5 mm Tris-Cl was 9.5 S, whereas that of the preparation treated with 5% Triton X-100 was 9.0 S. The sedimentation coefficient of 11.7 S for the untreated CcO is consistent with previous studies of the dimeric protein (10Georgevich G. Darley-Usmar V.M. Malatesta F. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Robinson et al. (11Robinson N.C. Talbert L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2328-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) measured a sedimentation coefficient of 8.7 S for monomeric CcO treated with Triton X-100, which is consistent with the value of 9.0 S obtained in the present study. The reduction of compound F is an important step in the mechanism of dioxygen reduction by cytochrome c oxidase and is coupled to proton pumping (1Ferguson-Miller S. Babcock J.T. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2889-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 2Babcock G.T. Wikstrom M. Nature. 1992; 356: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The single-electron reduction of compound F by photoexcited Ru2C has been shown previously to be biphasic for bovine CcO in 0.1% lauryl maltoside at pH 8.0, with a major slow phase with a rate constant of 470 s−1, and a minor fast phase with a rate constant of 1500 s−1 (9Zaslavsky D. Sadoski R.C. Wang K. Durham B. Gennis R.B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14910-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results are comparable to those observed previously using time-resolved spectroscopy (7Nilsson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6497-6501Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), or an electrogenic method (24Konstantinov A.A. Siletsky S. Mitchell D. Kaulen A. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9085-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 25Zaslavsky D. Kaulen A.D. Smirnova I.A. Vygodina T. Konstantinov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The minor fast phase was observed in all three studies, but its origin was not known. The present studies demonstrate that at least one contributing factor for the observed biphasic kinetics of compound F reduction is heterogeneity of the state of aggregation of cytochrome oxidase. In the current work, CcO in 0.1% lauryl maltoside has a sedimentation coefficient of 11.7 S, which is comparable to that of previous dimeric preparations (10Georgevich G. Darley-Usmar V.M. Malatesta F. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This is inconsistent with the report of Suarez et al. (12Suarez M.D. Revzin A. Narlock R. Kempner E.S. Thompson D.A. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13791-13799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that bovine CcO is monomeric in lauryl maltoside, but it is important to note that a partially delipidated preparation of enzyme was used in this previous work. Significantly, the bovine CcO is dimeric in single crystals obtained from decyl maltoside solutions (17Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Iroh K. Nakashima T. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar). Hence, it seems likely that the bovine CcO preparation in lauryl maltoside used in the current work is mostly in the dimeric form, and this correlates with the observed biphasic kinetics of reduction of compound F, with a dominant (>80%) slow phase. The reduction of compound F occurs in a single slow phase with a rate constant of 450 s−1 for the bovine enzyme in 0.1% Triton X-100, which has been shown to consist of dimers and higher aggregates (11Robinson N.C. Talbert L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2328-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Raising the Triton X-100 concentration to 1% resulted in biphasic kinetics with equal amplitudes for the fast and slow phases. This is consistent with ultracentrifuge studies showing approximately equal concentrations of monomers and dimers at this Triton X-100 concentration (11Robinson N.C. Talbert L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2328-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Incubation with 5% Triton X-100 at pH 8.0 or 8.5 has been shown to lead to nearly complete formation of monomeric CcO (10Georgevich G. Darley-Usmar V.M. Malatesta F. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Robinson N.C. Talbert L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2328-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficient of 9.0 obtained for this preparation in the current work is comparable to the value of 8.7 reported previously for monomeric bovine CcO (11Robinson N.C. Talbert L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2328-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The relative amplitude of the slow phase of compound F reduction is only 12% in this preparation of the enzyme. The rate constant for the fast phase of compound F reduction in this preparation, 2400 s−1, is somewhat larger than observed at lower concentrations of Triton X-100 or lauryl maltoside. It is known that there is some disruption of subunit-subunit interactions in CcO by high concentrations of Triton X-100. Georgevich et al. (10Georgevich G. Darley-Usmar V.M. Malatesta F. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) reported partial loss of subunit III, as well as several small subunits in the preparation treated with 5% Triton X-100 at pH 8.5. However, we have not observed significant loss of subunit III with this procedure (26Hall J. Moubarak A. O'Brien P. Pan L.P. Cho I. Millett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8142-8149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No loss of subunits occurs in the preparation of Robinson and Talbert (11Robinson N.C. Talbert L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2328-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which involves incubation with 5% Triton X-100 at pH 8.0. It should be noted that the steady-state cytochrome c oxidase activity is very low when measured in the presence of Triton X-100, but can be restored by diluting cytochrome oxidase into buffers containing other detergents such as lauryl maltoside or Tween 80 (10, 11). The steady-state activity of the preparation treated with 5% Triton X-100 was found to be the same as untreated dimeric cytochrome oxidase, in agreement with previous studies (10Georgevich G. Darley-Usmar V.M. Malatesta F. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Robinson N.C. Talbert L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2328-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the rate constant and equilibrium constant for electron transfer from CuA to heme a is not affected by the 5% Triton X-100 treatment. These results indicate that the Triton X-100 treatment does not cause a general denaturation of the enzyme. Similar to the results obtained with high Triton X-100, incubation of the dimeric CcO preparation at pH 10 in 0.1% lauryl maltoside led to a major fast phase of compound F reduction with a rate constant of 1650 s−1. Incubation at pH 10.0 has previously been reported to lead to conversion of dimer CcO to monomeric CcO (15Love B. Chan S.H.P. Stotz E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6664-6668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficient of 9.5 for this preparation in the current work is consistent with substantial conversion to the monomeric enzyme. The effect of the pH treatment was irreversible, since decreasing the pH back down to 7.4 did not restore a major slow phase of the kinetics. The modest pH dependence of the rate constant of the slow phase of compound F reduction in 0.1% lauryl maltoside was previously fit to an ionization with a pKa of 9.0, with limiting rate constants of 525 and 120 s−1 at low and high pH, respectively (9Zaslavsky D. Sadoski R.C. Wang K. Durham B. Gennis R.B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14910-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This is comparable to results obtained in experiments involving flash photolysis of CO-bound reduced CcO in the presence of oxygen (27Hallen S. Nilsson T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11853-11859Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Oliveberg M. Brzezinski P. Malmstrom B.G. Biochim, Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the pH dependence observed in the flow-flash experiments is due to a group with a pKa of 9, which is involved in proton delivery to the binuclear center (28Oliveberg M. Brzezinski P. Malmstrom B.G. Biochim, Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, the current work shows that the pH dependence is completely absent in preparations involving conversion to monomeric CcO. Note that the monomeric oxidase preparations used in the current work have been shown previously to be active in proton pumping (13Thompson, D. A., Gregory, L., and Ferguson-Miller, S. (1985)J. Inorg. Biochem. 23357–364Google Scholar), and have the same steady state and CuA to heme a electron transfer activity as dimeric cytochrome oxidase. It seems unlikely that these treatments of the enzyme would affect a critical group directly involved in proton transfer without resulting in impairment of function. It is more likely that the pH dependence of the rate of reduction of compound F that is observed with the untreated dimeric CcO is due to the deprotonation of one or more residues which indirectly affect the rate of proton transfer. This indirect conformational pH effect is apparently imposed by structural considerations that are eliminated by treatments that convert the enzyme to the monomeric form. Whether it is the monomeric species per se that is responsible or an unrelated structural perturbation caused by the treatment of the enzyme cannot be ascertained. However, the fact that two very different protocols that have traditionally been used to yield monomeric enzyme each have the same effect on the kinetics of reduction of compound F suggest that monomerization is important. It is perhaps significant that the rate constant for the reduction of compound F is faster in monomeric cytochrome oxidase than in the dimeric enzyme. Possibly, the quaternary structure may regulate the rate of reduction of oxyferryl heme, and this regulation is removed in the monomeric enzyme. The fast phase of compound F reduction has a large deuterium isotope effect of 8.0 in the Triton X-100 preparation, indicating that electron transfer remains strongly coupled to proton transfer during the reduction of compound F. The rate of delivery of protons to the binuclear center during this step in the mechanism might be influenced by conformational changes determined by the subunit arrangement. This raises the possibility that the enzyme might be allosterically regulated in vivo by alterations in protein conformation induced by post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation) or by interactions with other proteins. The state of aggregation of cytochrome oxidase in the mitochondrial membrane is not known definitively (8Estey L.A. Prochaska L.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13270-13276Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), nor is it known whether the state of aggregation is biologically regulated. In any event, it is clear that the rate of electron transfer within the enzyme is strictly coupled to proton transfer and, therefore, is subject to any factor that might control the pK values of critical proton donors or acceptors or to the connectivity of the proton-conducting pathway within the enzyme.

In 1986, two independent research groups demonstrated that triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs)1 can be used to specifically recognize a given sequence in a DNA double helix (3LeDoan T.

Polypyrimidine TFOs bind specifically to complementary poly(Pu)·poly(Py) double-helix sequences by formation of Hoogsteen base pairs between thymines or protonated cytosines in the TFO and adenines or guanines, respectively, in the poly(Pu) strand of the DNA double helix. The molecular recognition process is highly sensitive to base mismatches, so that a single duplex site can be targeted within megabase DNA (5Radhakrishnan I. Patel D.J.

Recent analyses by NMR and FT-IR have shown that D:DD and R:DD triple helices (where DD stands for the DNA double helix, and D: or R: for the DNA or RNA TFO, respectively) have heterogeneous backbone conformations, leading to energetically compromised conformations for certain ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides in the three strands (9Liquier J.

Results in our laboratory and others, with third strand sequences containing a variable number of nucleotides with modified bases or backbones, show thus far nonunderstood differences in affinity as a function of the target sequence and the position of the modified nucleosides in the chain (21Hildbrand S. Blaser A. Parel S.P. Leumann C.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5499-5511Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22Imanishi T. Obika S.J. Synth. Org. Chem.

Tetrahedron Let. 2000; 41: 4855-4859Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Given these data, the question arises whether, upon binding with its target double helix, a TFO containing an intrinsically heterogeneous backbone conformation, allowing for a tailor-made structural fit to the target, could increase the triplex stability compared with a TFO with a homogeneous backbone. With this in mind, we developed a general method based on a combinatorial approach. The method is based on the synthesis of a combinatorial library of TFOs containing either ribo- or deoxyribonucleosides with the requisite base at each position in the chain. Both types of nucleoside units intrinsically prefer different sugar conformations (3′-endo for ribonucleosides and 2′-endo for deoxyribonucleotides) and thus give rise to a large variety of backbone conformations in the corresponding TFOs. After affinity chromatography on the immobilized target double helix, utilizing a temperature gradient as the selection criterion, and subsequent deconvolution of the thus obtained fractions by chemical and analytical means, the molecular features of TFOs leading to enhanced triple helix stability were defined. Based on these features, single oligonucleotides were designed, synthesized, and characterized for proof of principle. The results obtained validate our combinatorial approach, showing distinct effects of the nature of the sugar on triplex stability, depending on the position within the TFO chain. This method lends itself for use in the assay of oligonucleotides containing new, chemically modified nucleoside analogues, as it does not rely on an enzymatic amplification and in vivo deconvolution step typically used in DNA and RNA selection protocols. Single oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Amersham Pharmacia BiotechGene-Assembler special DNA synthesizer using standard β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry and the manufacturer's protocols (24Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Users Manual 56-1111-56: Gene Assembler Special/4 Primers, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJGoogle Scholar). dU, dT, dC, rU, rC, spacer-C18, and 5′-amino-modifier-C12 phosphoramidites were from Glen Research. The TFOs were synthesized on a 1.0-μmol scale. For the introduction of ribonucleotides, the coupling time was prolonged to 6 min. After final detritylation, the oligomers were removed from the solid support and deprotected with 25% NH4OH:ethanol (3:1), at 55 °C overnight. No ethanol was added for the deprotection of all-DNA oligonucleotides. After filtration and drying, deprotection of the 2′-OH groups, where necessary, was achieved with 1 m tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran (24 h at room temperature; Refs. 25Usman N. Ogilvie K.K. Jiang M.Y. Cedergren R.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 7845-7854Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholarand 26Scaringe S.A. Francklyn C. Usman N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The TFOs were purified by IE-HPLC followed by IP-RP-HPLC under the conditions indicated below, and characterized by IE-HPLC and IP-RP-HPLC, ESI-MS, UV-visible spectrophotometry, and gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The hairpin DNA double helix (dh) was synthesized on a 10-μmol scale. The dh was deprotected, purified, and characterized as indicated above for the TFOs. Names and composition are as indicated in the corresponding figures. The triple helices are named as the corresponding TFO, with the addendum th. For the synthesis of the TFO library M, the “split and combine” technique was used. First, two 10-μmol columns filled with dC-CPG phosphoramidite solid support were placed in the DNA-synthesizer, one dC residue was coupled to one of them, and one rC residue to the other. At the end of the coupling cycle (before detritylation), the columns were removed and the resins mixed together and separated again in two equal parts. New cycles were performed in the same way, always adding a ribonucleotide in one column and the corresponding deoxyribonucleotide in the other (rC and dC, or rU and dT, respectively). Removal of the solid support and nucleotide deprotection were achieved as indicated above. Trityl-on purification was performed with the aim to facilitate the separation of all the members of the library from the non-tritylated, truncated sequences. The crude, tritylated product was purified by IP-RP-HPLC, detritylated with 80% acetic acid (30 min, room temperature), lyophilized, and redissolved in deionized water. Thus, a library of 211 oligonucleotides was obtained. The hairpin DNA double helix containing the 5′-aminolinker unit (dh-NH2) was coupled to the gel matrix (NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mNaHCO3 buffer, pH 8, for 2 h at room temperature. The derivatized matrix (10 ml) was then packed into a chromatographic column (XK16, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the remaining non-reacted functional groups of the matrix were deactivated with ethanolamine. The column was attached to a HPLC system (ÄKTAbasic, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The total amount of dh immobilized into the column was estimated to be 1 μmol. The column was stored at 4 °C, using 20% ethanol as storage solution. The affinity chromatography experiments were performed in the following way. 0.42 μmol of the TFO library M in 1 ml of elution buffer (0.1m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmcitrate/phosphate, pH 6.0) were loaded onto the affinity chromatography (AC) column and allowed to hybridize for 1 h at 5 °C. The fraction of the library containing the non-binders and the failure sequences was then eluted with 15–20 ml of elution buffer at 1 ml/min and 5 °C. Then, the temperature was increased by 10 °C, the system left to stabilize for 15 min, and the next fraction was eluted. This cycle was repeated four times, up to 45 °C, after which the column was washed with pH 7.0 buffer to ensure that all TFO were eluted. The five recovered fractions were lyophilized, redissolved in water, and desalted through Sephadex G-25 resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fractions were characterized in the same manner as the other oligonucleotides. The samples were used directly after IP-RP purification or desalted by dialysis for 1.5 h against deionized water on a nitrocellulose filter (Millipore), then concentrated to 50–100 pmol/μl, and analyzed on a VG Platform electrospray mass spectrometer (Micromass). The oligonucleotides, TFO libraries, or fractions were 5′ end-labeled with 32P using [γ-32P]ATP (Hartmann), T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and standard protocols. After lyophilization, they were dissolved in 50 mmNaHCO3, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 9.3 buffer and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. The pH was then lowered with 1m HCl, and a new incubation performed (2 min at 37 °C) in order to break remaining 2′-3′-cyclophosphate ends (27Beier H. Gross H.J. Brown T.A. Essential Molecular Biology: A Practical Approach. IRL-Oxford University Press, New York1991: 221-236Google Scholar). The results were analyzed by PAGE under denaturing conditions (24% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea). Reading and quantification of the bands was done on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (version 3.3) for data processing. Results are an average of at least three independent experiments. UV-visible absorbance measurements were performed using a Cary 3E UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian). The molar extinction coefficient of each oligonucleotide (or AC fraction) was calculated using nearest neighbor approximation (28Puglisi J.D. Tinoco Jr., I. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 304-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). 2 nmol of the corresponding oligonucleotides were lyophilized to dryness and redissolved in 1 ml of a 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 4.4–6.8). To ensure the correct formation of the triple helix, the resulting solution was heated to 85 °C and allowed to slowly cool down to room temperature, followed by storage at 4 °C overnight. The pH of the solution was verified using a microelectrode. Prior to thermal experiments, the UV-visible spectra of the samples (210–350 nm) were measured at around 1 °C. Absorbance versus temperature profiles were measured at two wavelengths (260 and 300 nm), using a linear gradient of 0.5 °C/min and a heating-cooling-heating cycle between 0 and 90 °C. Data were analyzed using Origin50 software. Liquid chromatography experiments were done on anÄKTAbasic F System with UNICORN software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), using a DEAE column (Nucleogen 60–7) for IE and a C18 column (Nucleosil 100–5) for IP-RP chromatography, both from Macherey-Nagel. Eluents were as follows. For IE, eluent was 10 mmKH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 6.5, 20% CH3CN, with 1 m KCl in eluent B. For IP-RP, eluent was 10 mm triethylamineacetic acid, pH 7.5, in H2O for eluent A and in 80% CH3CN for eluent B. The gradient was as indicated for each experiment. The TFO base sequence chosen in this investigation (see Fig.1 A) was designed as to contain a T-rich part, a part of equal distribution of T and C, and a C-rich part, allowing for maximum sequence variability in the TFO and in the corresponding target double helix. Its length was chosen in order to stay within the limits of its detectability by UV melting measurements (see Tm values in Fig. 1 A), and to comply with the permissive temperature range of the affinity chromatography matrix. The selection process was designed as indicated in the flow chart (Fig.1 B). Synthesis of the TFO library and the immobilized dh, as well as the hybridization and selection strategies, are detailed under “Materials and Methods.” A first round of selection with the TFO library M, containing the complete set of 2048 individual oligonucleotides, was performed utilizing a temperature gradient as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” The results are shown in Fig.2. Five fractions (M05 to M45) at five different temperatures, containing individuals with increasing affinity to the double helix, were isolated and subsequently deconvoluted by a series of analytical steps explained in detail below. These experiments were performed in order to verify that oligonucleotides were eluted exclusively as a function of the thermal stability of the corresponding triple helices. As expected, hysteresis was observed between heating and cooling profiles due to slow kinetics of triplex formation (29Maher III, L.J. Dervan P.B. Wolf B.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8820-8826Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 30Rougée M. Faucon B. Barcelo F. Giovannangeli T. Garestier T. Hélène C.

The melting temperatures for third strand dissociation (Tm) were determined at the maximum of the first derivative of the heating curves. They are taken as indicative values for the stability of the triple helices, and not as thermodynamic parameters. The observed Tm of the triple helices confirmed the non-binding of the M05 fraction and the stability order of the triple helices formed by the other fractions under the conditions applied (Table I).Table IRelative size (%) of the AC fractions from the TFO library MM45M35M25M15M05%1.824.546.215.212.4T m(th)34.329.124.320.75.6A 260/A 2801.541.481.431.451.59t r18.719.219.619.719.2Table shows characterization by thermal stability of the triple helix (T m), 260 to 280 nm absorbance ratio, and retention time (t r) in IE-HPLC (15–65% B buffer gradient in 25 min). Open table in a new tab Table shows characterization by thermal stability of the triple helix (T m), 260 to 280 nm absorbance ratio, and retention time (t r) in IE-HPLC (15–65% B buffer gradient in 25 min). The differences in mass between ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides originated by the presence or absence of the 2′-O and of the 5-Me group in the case of rU/dT. These differences led to a mass distribution in the library M as indicated in Fig.3 A, where each mass represents from only 1 (in the corners of the table) to 200 (in the center) individual TFOs. The ribocytidine content of the TFOs can thus be easily quantified by the increase of n × 16 mass units (n = 0–5) for each new rC, with respect to the all-DNA TFO d. By contrast, the presence of a rU instead of a dT in the oligonucleotide leads to an increase of only two mass units (+ 16 from 2′-O, −14 from 5-Me). Due to the fact that the spectrum is complicated by the presence of isotopic peaks that overlap with those corresponding to different rU contents in each group of constant rC, it was not possible to resolve the families of constant rC into their different rU-containing subfamilies, so that we could only estimate the rU/dT ratio by comparing the maximum values of the peaks obtained for each family. The mass spectrum of M is depicted in Fig. 3 Btogether with the calculated one (Fig. 3 B,inset). The detection of all signals near to the expected relative intensities assesses the quality of the library. This mass spectrum was thus used as a control for the study of the corresponding fractions. The rC content in each fraction was defined from the quantification of the signals corresponding to different rC families, and compared with the mass spectrum of the whole library M. It clearly emerges (Fig.3 C) that there is a preference for more rC over dC units when moving toward the more stable AC fractions. The first eluting fractions have a slightly lower rC content than the average, while M35 contains a higher rC content. The AC fraction containing the strongest binding TFOs is populated by rC-rich species, suggesting that the increase in triplex stability goes parallel with the increase in the number of rC residues. In order to correct for the different sizes of the rC families and the different sizes of the fractions, each mass signal was normalized, and the values obtained for the same mass peak in different fractions were compared in order to obtain a rough idea on the number of species that they represent. For this calculation, the assumptions were made that every TFO of the library is only present in one fraction, and that each TFO represents an equal part of the library. The values obtained are shown in the table in Fig.3 D. It can be seen that the proportion of each rC family, which is present in the M45 fraction, doubles at each single increase in rC content, corroborating that individuals with more rC units have a higher probability of being found in the more stable TFO fractions. The average rU content in each rC family was estimated from the maximum value of the corresponding mass peak. We found values ranking from 2.6 to 4.6, with higher rU content in the more retained AC fractions for every rC family. These results indicate that the triple helix stabilization brought about by rU does not depend on the presence of rC or dC, as the values are similar for all rC families in the same fraction. Another conclusion is that the presence of rU is not a general guarantee for high stability, as fraction M45 contains an average of only 4.1 rU of 6 possible. At basic pH (pH > 9), ribooligonucleotides undergo strand cleavage by 2′,3′-cyclophosphate formation. Deoxyribonucleotides are stable under these conditions. Statistical control of this degradation process allows the reaction to take place at a maximum of one nucleotide per chain, and the 5′ end32P-labeled fragments can then be detected and analyzed by PAGE. The presence of ribonucleotides at each position along the TFO can thus be evaluated. Applied to the library M and its fractions, an average ribonucleoside distribution is obtained at each position in the chain. An example of this experiment is shown in Fig.4. For the analysis of these data, the signal intensities were corrected to a normalized total reactivity for each fraction and related to those of the whole library M. This method is complementary to analysis by MS since it allows detection of the positions at which ribonucleotides can be found, whereas MS reveals the total number of ribonucleosides in the TFOs of the fraction. In the stronger binding AC fraction M45, we find a requirement for ribonucleotides in the central part (positions 4–9) and a preference for dT over rU in positions 1 and 2. In positions 10 and 11, similar reactivities were found for all fractions, indicating a lack of preference for these positions. This explains the fact that the average rU content found for M45 by ESI-MS is only 4.1, and that many individuals with one or two dC are present in this fraction. It emerges as a general rule that sequence-dependent differences in triplex stability are more encountered for dT versus rU than for dC versus rC replacements. In the low binding fraction M05, the ribonucleotides are evenly scattered over all positions, and an anomalous migration is found for the fragments containing the nucleotides 8 and 9, which is not reflected in the migration of shorter and longer fragments, as well as in the mass spectra. A possible explanation for this and the poor triple-helix formation propensity by the members of this fraction is that a 2′ to 3′ phosphate migration of a part of the library had occurred during synthesis or deprotection. The UV-visible spectrum (210–350 nm) of RNA and DNA of the same sequence and length differ in the position of the absorption peak, because uridine has a near-UV maximum at 260 nm, rather than the 268 nm for deoxythymidine (33Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophys. Chem. 1980; 2: 382-383Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the A 260/A 280 ratio in order to estimate the rU/dT contents of the fractions. As shown in Table I, only little differences were found, with the higher rU/dT ratio occurring in the first and last fractions. These results indicate independently that a continuously increasing rU/dT ratio in the TFO goes not in parallel with increased stability of the triple helix. In IE-HPLC, the whole TFO library M eluted with intermediate retention times compared with the pure TFOs r11d and d (Table I). As expected, M45 and M35 have shorter retention times, indicating a higher ribonucleotide content. During IP-RP-HPLC, average retention times followed the sequence M45 < M35 < M05 ≤ M ≤ M25 ≈ M15, clearly indicating the presence of more ribonucleotides in the strong binding fractions. The intermediate position of the fraction M05 can again be explained by the fact that it mainly contains truncated 11-mers and sequences originating from phosphodiester isomerization. The chromatograms of M35 and M45 show better resolved peaks, which is in agreement with the presence of fewer species. The following conclusions could be drawn from the results obtained. (i) An “RNA core” is necessary for high triple helix stability, (ii) ribonucleotides at the 3′ end of the TFO have a negative effect on stability, and (iii) TFOs with higher rC content show higher triplex stability in a sequence-independent manner. Taking this into account, we designed and synthesized the sublibrary P corresponding to the all-rC family of M. This library contains only 64 individuals, with all C in the ribo-form (except the 3′-terminal unit), and dT and rU as variables. With this focused library, a second round of selection was performed. The TFO sublibrary P (Fig. 5) was prepared much in the same way as described for M. The sublibrary was again assayed for triplex formation by affinity chromatography on the immobilized dh, as before. The resulting elution profile (Fig. 6), as expected, showed the higher populated fractions eluting at higher temperatures (P35 and P45). The small peak arising at 90-ml elution volume is an artifact produced by the change of eluent. The thermal denaturation UV profiles of the collected fractions (Fig. 7) again verify the success of the selection process. UV-visible absorption spectra were measured for all fractions. The highestA 260/A 280 ratios were found for P45 and P35, indicating a higher content of rU (Fig. 6). The fractions were further characterized as before.Figure 6Top, affinity chromatography of the TFO library P, with the names of the recovered fractions.

Monitoring pre-steady state fluorescence intensity emission changes upon an addition of a ligand to the enzyme was possible by a unique tryptophan per subunit of the enzyme. Binding of fructose 6-phosphate to the enzyme displayed a two-step process, with a fast complex formation step followed by a relatively slower isomerization step. Systematic addition of fructose 6-phosphate to phosphofructokinase in the absence and presence of several fixed concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate indicated that the inhibitor binds to the enzyme concurrently with the substrate, forming a ternary complex and inducing a conformational change, rather than a displacement of the equilibrium as predicted by the classical two-state model (Monod, J., Wyman, J., and Changeux, J. P. (1965) J. Mol. Biol. 12, 88–118). The activator, MgADP, also altered the affinity of fructose 6-phosphate to the enzyme by forming a ternary complex. Furthermore, both phosphoenolpyruvate and MgADP act by influencing the fast complex formation step while leaving the slower enzyme isomerization step essentially unchanged.

Furthermore, both phosphoenolpyruvate and MgADP act by influencing the fast complex formation step while leaving the slower enzyme isomerization step essentially unchanged. phosphofructokinase fructose 6-phosphate phosphoenolpyruvate Monod-Wyman-Changeux Phosphofructokinase (PFK)1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) from MgATP to form fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and MgADP. Allosteric mechanism is one of the regulation strategies used by PFK to control catalysis in this first committed and highly regulated step of glycolysis. Allostery is defined as effector ligand(s) binding to a remote site (allosteric site) and influences the binding affinity of substrate(s) to the active site. Activators increase, whereas inhibitors decrease, substrate binding affinity. In Escherichia coli PFK, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is a potent inhibitor of Fru-6-P binding, whereas MgADP is a weak activator (1Blangy D. Buc H. Monod J. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 31: 13-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The allosteric properties of E. coli PFK have been studied extensively using steady state enzyme kinetics (1Blangy D. Buc H.

Linkage is defined as a reciprocity of effects between an allosteric ligand and a substrate interacting to an enzyme. The nature (i.e. whether activating or inhibiting) and potency of change resulting from an interaction is the same regardless of whether an allosteric ligand or a substrate binds to the enzyme first. This linkage phenomenon is a convenient method to derive rate and equilibrium constants from reaction steps that are not readily discernible by physical techniques. Linkage effects can be quantified by a coupling constant Q, where Q above 1 denotes an activating coupling interaction and Q below 1 denotes an inhibiting interaction, between two or more ligands (22Reinhart G.D. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 30: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Braxton B.L. Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Reinhart G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 47-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). InE. coli PFK, the binding affinity of Fru-6-P is 90-fold reduced in the presence of saturating concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (Q = ∼0.011), regardless of whether PEP or Fru-6-P binds first (13Johnson J.L. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12814-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of Fru-6-P is 6 times higher in the presence than in the absence of MgADP (Q = 5.6). 2A. S. Pham and G. D. Reinhart, submitted for publication. To date, we understand little of how linkage is manifested under pre-steady state and non-steady state conditions. Few reports have addressed allosteric phenomena in the pre-steady state time scale (24Auzat I. Gawlita E. Garel J.-R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,25Brzovic P.S. Ngo K. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3831-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Only recently, Auzat et al. (24Auzat I. Gawlita E. Garel J.-R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) reported the intrinsic rate constants, as determined by stopped-flow kinetics, associated with the binding of Fru-6-P, PEP, and MgADP to E. coli PFK. By using several concentrations of effectors and substrates, the authors clarified some aspects of the allosteric properties of PFK by examining the interactions between substrates, enzymes, and effectors. Changes in the rate constants for the interaction between Fru-6-P and PFK in the presence of effectors were inferred to be due to a conformational transition between an equilibrium of R (relax, high affinity, high activity) and T (taut, low affinity, low activity) conformational states (2Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar). The Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) two-state model relates these mutually exclusive pre-existing conformational states to enzymatic activities (2Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar). Modifications to the MWC model were made as necessary, by supplementing new states such as the Rf, Ra, and “not genuine T” states, to characterize kinetically distinct processes (24Auzat I. Gawlita E. Garel J.-R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These conformational state assignments if not confusing, were ambiguous as it became increasingly apparent that the two-state model provides a limited framework for interpreting allosteric properties (4Auzat I. Le Bras G. Garel J.-R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 5Deville-Bonne D. Bourgain F. Garel J.-R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5750-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Lau F.T.-K. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1987; 326: 811-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the first place, the formation of a possible ternary complex between substrate, inhibitor, and protein, which has been substantiated (13Johnson J.L. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12814-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), was not considered. Second, when a model appears to mathematically explain a phenomenon so well, regardless of whether it has any biophysical basis, it is tempting to design experiments by sampling only a few representative effector concentrations to conform to its guiding principles. When the rate constant for a substrate in the presence of an inhibitor differs from that in the presence of an activator, the disparity is attributed to the shifting of the enzyme between differing conformational states. Saturation plateaus were not often observed when only few effector concentrations were examined, and ligand interactions appeared to be competitive. By systematically varying the Fru-6-P concentration in a wide range of constant effector ligand concentrations (or vice versa) to explore a complete two-dimensional array of substrate and effector concentrations, we can examine comprehensively the processes involved in ligand-influenced binding events. All reagents used in experiments were of analytical grade and were purchased from either Sigma or Fisher. The purification protocol and steady state kinetics were performed as described previously (18Pham A.S. Janiack-Spens F. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4140-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 19Pham A.S. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40 (4148): 4150Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The pre-steady state kinetic experiments were performed using an Applied Photophysics SX18.MV model stopped-flow spectrofluorometer connected to an Acorn Archimedes 420/1 operating system. The instrument was set with a 2-mm path length cell and an excitation band pass of <10 nm (slit width = 1 or 2 mm). In most cases, the sample was subjected to excitation at 295 nm with a 150-watt xenon arc lamp, and emission intensity was monitored through a WG-335 (Schott) cut-on filter between the sample cell and the detector. The dead time of the instrument (i.e. the period between the trigger of the flow and the start of data collection) was estimated (27Peterman B.F. Laidler K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 577: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) at 1.4 ms, which gives an upper rate limit of ∼700 s−1. Pseudo-first order conditions were maintained in which the protein concentration (0.5–2 μm, 0.02–0.07 mg/ml) was at least 10 times less than that of the ligand concentrations. No dependence of the observed rate constant on PFK concentration was detected within this concentration range. Data were collected within a pre-selected time range, and data points within the first 2 ms were discarded when fitting the data. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, all rate constants were determined from an average of six runs, with each run consisting of 400 data points. In the coupling experiment between a substrate and an effector ligand, PFK was combined with an appropriate ligand concentration in one syringe, and a second ligand was introduced via another syringe to initiate the reaction. Nonlinear regression analyses were performed using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy). Decays profiles were fit to a single exponential equation, yielding the observed rate constant (kobs). Values of kobs as a function of ligand concentrations were then fit to the rate-dependent mechanisms described below. As with steady state conditions, experiments were performed with enzyme and ligand species in EPPS buffer (pH 8, KOH), 10 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 0.1 mmEDTA. The steady state rate equation describing the interaction of substrate A and allosteric ligandX with the enzyme E is shown (28Reinhart G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 224: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in Equation1. vET=VoKixo[A]+VoQaxWax[A][X]KiaoKixo+Kixo[A]+Kiao[X]+Qax[A][X]Equation 1 where v is the observed rate, V ois the maximal rate in the absence of allosteric ligand, andWax is the coupling constant reflecting theVmax influence between A andX. Qax is the coupling constant describing the binding affinities of A andX to the enzyme. K iao and K ixo are the dissociation constants for A and X, respectively, in the absence of all other ligands. Since ET = [E] + [EA] + [EX] + [AEX], the concentration of the ternary complex can be calculated using the following expression: [AEX]=Qax[A][X]KiaoKixo+Kixo[A]+Kiao[X]+Qax[A][X]Equation 2 By using Equation 2, we determined that at least 60 mm Fru-6-P and 200 mm PEP are needed to obtain 90% of the fractional component from which the ternary complexAEX predominates. Thus, to characterize fully a coupling interaction between two ligands, a wide concentration range of each ligand was needed to capture the various ligand complex states. This finding is the basis of our rationale for performing the experiments at extremely high ligand concentrations. For data exhibiting a linear observed rate dependence as a function of ligand concentration, the simplest model to describe the binding of a ligand to an enzyme is a one-step mechanism, E+X ⇌koffkon E−X. SCHEME IThis model predicts that a single first order rate constant will be observed and related to kon andkoff by the expression,kobs = kon[X] + koff, wherekon is the rate constant for the bimolecular association of a ligand to an enzyme, and koffis the unimolecular dissociation rate constant (29Johnson, K. A., The Enzymes, 3rd Ed., Sigman, D. S., 20, 1992, 1, 61, Academic Press, San DiegoGoogle Scholar). However, a hyperbolic dependence of the observed rate constant as a function of ligand concentration requires minimally a two-step mechanism, where one step is concentration-independent. The mechanism that best describes the rate dependence pattern for the binding of Fru-6-P to PFK is given by Scheme II (24Auzat I. Gawlita E. Garel J.-R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,30Hiromi K. Kinetics of Fast Reactions. Halsted Press, New York1979: 255-283Google Scholar), E+X ⇌K1 EX ⇌k4k3 E′X SCHEME IIThe ligand binding process is defined byK1, an equilibrium constant (K1 =k2/k1), and by a relatively slow unimolecular isomerization process that is represented by the forward (k3) and reverse (k4) steps. The isomerization step can be detected spectroscopically, and the rate dependence pattern is expressed by Equation 3, kobs=k3[X]K1+[X]+k4Equation 3 where kobs is the observed rate constant. For the mechanism shown in Scheme II, the apparent overall dissociation constant (K) is determined by Equation 4 (24Auzat I. Gawlita E. Garel J.-R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30Hiromi K. Kinetics of Fast Reactions. Halsted Press, New York1979: 255-283Google Scholar), K=[E][X][EX]+[E′X]=K11+(1/K2)=K11+k3/k4Equation 4 where K1 is the equilibrium constant for the fast complexation step of EX; K2is the equilibrium constant for the isomerization process between theEX and E′X forms (K2 =k4/k3), andk3 and k4 are the unimolecular forward and reverse isomerization rate constants, respectively. For the coupling constant determination, the rate Equation 1 can be simplified to (22Reinhart G.D. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 30: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Reinhart G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 224: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) Equation 5, Kia=KiaoKixo+[X]Kixo+Qax[X]Equation 5 where Kia represents an apparent dissociation constant determined from steady state measurements and K iao is the dissociation constant in the absence of other ligand. To determine the maximum relative fluorescence change and the fraction of the total fluorescence change occurring within the dead time of the instrument at a particular concentration of the substrate, we used the following Equation 6 (31Tanaka A. Ohnishi M. Hiromi K. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), ΔFa=ΔFo(1−e−kobsdt)Equation 6 where ΔFo is the observed fluorescence change; dt is the dead time of the instrument, and ΔFa is the actual change in fluorescence with a dead time of 0. Congruency between ΔFa and the fluorescence changes derived from equilibrium measurements indicates that the total contributions of amplitude changes are fully accounted by the observed changes derived from pre-steady state techniques. The dependence of the observed rate constant (kobs) for the binding of Fru-6-P to the enzyme exhibited a hyperbolic pattern that approached saturation at Fru-6-P concentrations above 1 mm (Fig.1). Introducing Fru-6-P at the lowest concentration allowable by the detection system to the free PFK yielded a rate constant of 100 s−1; binding approached an apparent upper rate constant of ∼400 s−1 at Fru-6-P concentrations greater than 1 mm. This pattern is well described by a two-step sequential mechanism shown in Scheme II, wherein the second process is the fluorescence detection step. These data are fully consistent with those reported by Auzat et al. (24Auzat I. Gawlita E. Garel J.-R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine how allosteric ligands affect the rate constant for binding, we monitored Fru-6-P binding in a range of fixed concentrations of PEP preincubated with the enzyme. The rate dependence for the binding of Fru-6-P to the PEP·PFK complex also displayed hyperbolic profiles that are well modeled by the two-step mechanism shown in Scheme II. Thekobs for Fru-6-P interaction as a function of PEP displayed several distinct transitions, and Fig.2 shows these transitions using several concentrations of PEP. In the absent of PEP, thekobs for Fru-6-P is between ∼100 and 400 s−1. In PEP concentrations of <0.5 mm, thekobs for Fru-6-P decreased drastically, displaying an overall downward shift in the trend. At 0.5 mm PEP, the kobs was generally 15 times lower, whereas the overall trend appeared to parallel that of thekobs pattern for Fru-6-P binding to free enzyme form. At PEP concentrations greater than 0.5 mm,kobs increased, with regions at both extreme Fru-6-P concentrations shifting upward. In PEP concentrations of 30 mm, the kobs at 100 mm Fru-6-P is comparable to kobsvalues extrapolated for saturating Fru-6-P concentrations interacting with free PFK. In addition, the mid-transitions, corresponding to theK1 value, become progressively steeper with increasing PEP concentrations. The kobs data for the Fru-6-P/PEP interactions were fit to Equation 3, and the derived dependence of rate and equilibrium constants are depicted in Fig.3. From the initial value of ∼300 s−1, the forward isomerization rate constant,k3, decreased dramatically with increasing effector concentrations up to 1 mm PEP and then rose gradually with increasing PEP concentrations up to 60 mm(Fig. 3 A). The midpoint of the downward transition appeared to be a PEP concentration of ∼0.3 mm, a value that is comparable the dissociation constant for PEP determined from equilibrium measurements. No further increase ink3 was observed at PEP concentrations above 15 mm. The trend exhibited by the k3values was clearly multiphasic, with only a minor difference in the values between low and high concentrations of PEP. The rate constant for the reverse isomerization step, k4, displayed a dependence on PEP concentration similar to that ofk3. The value of k4 was ∼90 s−1 in the absence of PEP, decreased to 5 s−1 at 1 mm PEP, and then increased gradually to 20 s−1 at a PEP concentration of 60 mm(Fig. 3 B). The difference of the k4value in the absence of PEP and that of saturating PEP concentrations was 4-fold. The influence of PEP on the interaction of Fru-6-P and PFK was largely exhibited in the complex formation step, as indicated by the higher equilibrium constants (K1) with increasing effector concentrations (Fig. 3 C). K1value initiated at 0.3 mm in the absence of PEP and approached a plateau of ∼60 mm at a PEP concentration of 30 mm. The K1 values approached at high PEP concentrations are consistent with the hypothesis of the formation of the PEP·PFK·Fru-6-P ternary complex. Thus, PEP appeared to act by affecting the ligand-encountered complex rather than by inducing a shift in subsequent conformation-change equilibrium. The overall dissociation constants obtained from pre-steady state measurements (K) were compared with those obtained from equilibrium fluorescence measurements (Kia) to determine whether these techniques fully account for the processes involved in binding. Each equilibrium value for Fru-6-P was derived as a function of a fixed PEP concentration. The K andKia data points overlap at the mid-range PEP concentrations (0.2–10 mm) but diverge at both extreme regions of PEP concentrations (data not shown). The K values initiated at 0.1 mm in the absence of PEP and decreased to 0.01 mm with increasing PEP concentrations of up to 0.25 mm; K values increased with PEP concentrations higher than 0.25 mm. The dip in the low PEP concentration range terminated coincidentally at the PEP concentration that corresponded to its dissociation constant (0.24 mm). The initial Kia value was determined to be 0.01 mm, in the absence of PEP, and increased in a sigmoidal pattern to 0.7 mm, in saturating PEP concentrations. The plateau region, indicating an approach of binding saturation, was 3 times lower for Kia than for K. Comparing the fluorescence amplitude trends determined by equilibrium measurements and those determined by stopped flow may provide insight to the discrepancy observed betweenK and Kia. Fig.4 shows the trends in the fluorescence amplitude change as a function of Fru-6-P concentration. The fluorescence signals for Fru-6-P determined by stopped-flow measurements only decreased by ∼10%, whereas the signals determined by steady state fluorescence decreased by a total of 30%. In both measurement types, the fluorescence signals for Fru-6-P in the presence of PEP was progressively smaller with increasing concentrations. The rate dependence pattern for the binding of allosteric ligands to the free enzyme in each case yielded a linear relationship in whichkobs is proportional to ligand concentration. The slope of each curve represents the second-order apparent rate constant for the loading of the ligand onto the enzyme, and the ordinate represents a first-order apparent rate constant for the unloading of the ligand from the enzyme. The observed rate for the binding of MgADP to PFK yielded a kon of 22 ± 0.8 mm−1 s−1 and for PEP to PFK yielded a kon of 3.0 ± 0.4 mm−1 s−1 and akoff of 5.7 ± 0.3 s−1. These values are fully consistent with those obtained by Auzat et al. (24Auzat I. Gawlita E. Garel J.-R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using slightly different buffer conditions. Introducing PEP to the PFK equilibrium complex containing various concentrations of Fru-6-P in all cases yielded kobs that ranged between the values observed for the binding of either PEP or Fru-6-P alone to the free enzyme. Fig. 5 shows the linear rate dependence pattern for the binding of PEP to PFK in the presence of various fixed concentrations of Fru-6-P. Addition of 30 mm PEP to 10 μm Fru-6-P in complex with PFK produced the kobs of ∼185 s−1, in contrast to the kobs of ∼85 s−1for PEP without Fru-6-P and ∼400 s−1 for Fru-6-P without PEP. At all Fru-6-P concentrations, the observed rate constant for PEP binding showed a linear concentration-dependent pattern, and no additional mechanistic steps were detected. Increasing the Fru-6-P concentrations caused the slope to become more shallow (corresponding to decreasing kon) and the intercept to increase (corresponding to increasingkoff). Decreasing konvalues for PEP were offset by the increase inkoff values. In addition, thekoff values appeared to be affected to a greater extent than the kon values;koff values were 15 times higher in the presence than in the absence of Fru-6-P, whereas konvalues were only 5 times lower. Both trends exhibited an approach of plateaus at Fru-6-P concentrations above 1 mm, providing evidence for a ternary complex of inhibitor, enzyme, and substrate.Figure FSIIIView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To compare the values derived from steady state with those from pre-steady state, the “measured” koff values were compared with the “calculated” koff. The calculated koff values were determined fromKia·kon, from whichKia values were derived using Equation 5. The parameters Kix for PEP and Kiafor Fru-6-P and the coupling constant values were obtained from equilibrium measurements reported previously (13Johnson J.L. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12814-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These calculatedkoff values roughly overlapped those measured values determined at pre-steady state with an approach of the point of saturation by a flattening of the trend apparent at Fru-6-P concentrations above 2 mm. A close correlation of the measured koff and the calculatedkoff rate constants indicated that the one-step mechanism adequately describes this kinetic process. Similar to the results for PEP binding to the PFK·Fru-6-P complex, the observed rate dependence for MgADP binding to the enzyme in the presence of fixed Fru-6-P concentrations (1–50 μm) yielded a linear relationship that was concentration-dependent. However, in contrast to the results for Fru-6-P/PEP binding, the slopes increased (rather than decreased) and the intercepts remained invariant (rather than increased) with higher Fru-6-P concentrations up to 50 μm (Fig. 6 A). As previously noted from experiments performed under equilibrium conditions, Fru-6-P and MgADP each independently produce substantial quenching of the PFK tryptophanyl fluorescence, but quenching is suppressed with increasing of ligand concentrations leading to insignificant changes in the presence of saturating concentrations of both ligands (6Johnson J.L. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11510-11518Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, rates for MgADP at Fru-6-P concentrations higher than 50 μm are unobtainable, because the changes in fluorescence intensity were insufficient to allow a determination of rate constants pertaining to the ternary complex. Although the results suggest that MgADP modestly influences the rate constant for Fru-6-P binding, however, with such limited Fru-6-P concentration ranges, the trend probably did not reflect the maximum changes possible by the ternary complex (Fig. 6 B). The measured and calculatedkoff values overlapped entirely and probably indicate that the measured rate constants reflect full accountability of the steps involved in the mechanism. When experiments were attempted in which Fru-6-P was introduced to the MgADP·PFK complex, the fluorescence signals were insignificant, and the observed rates cannot be measured reliably. The results indicate that the single-substrate, single-effector thermodynamic box previously described by Reinhart (28Reinhart G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 224: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) must be expanded to account for the intermediate isomerization step reflecting the interaction of Fru-6-P with the enzyme. A mechanism to describe the Fru-6-P binding to PFK, regardless of whether Fru-6-P binds to the free enzyme form or to the PFK·effector binary complex, is a two-step process that includes a complexation event followed by a slow structural isomerization (Scheme II). K io and K ia∞ describe the first complexation step in the absence and presence of allosteric ligand, respectively. The unimolecular rate constants k3and k4 describe, respectively, the forward and reverse isomerization step in the absence of effector.k9 and k10 correspond to the forward and reverse, respectively, rate constants in saturating concentrations of effector ligand. The binding of an allosteric ligand to free PFK or to the PFK·Fru-6-P complex conforms to a one-step mechanism; k5 and k11describe intrinsic bimolecular association rate constants in the absence of substrate and at the saturating substrate concentration, respectively; k6 and k12describe the unimolecular dissociation rate constants in the absence of Fru-6-P and at the saturating concentration of Fru-6-P, respectively. Table I summarizes these rate and equilibrium constants for the individual and three-way interactions between Fru-6-P, allosteric ligand, and the enzyme. Each overall ligand dissociation constant is then redefined to account for the additional step (Equation 7): Kiao=K1o1+k3/k4,Kia∞=K1∞1+k9/k10,Kixo=k6k5,Kix∞=k12k11Equation 7 The coupling constant (Q) is then defined with respect to rate constants (Equation 8) as follows: Qax=k6k11k5k12=K1o(1+k9/k10)K1∞(1+k3/k4)Equation 8 Table II shows a comparison of the coupling Q values derived from these rate constants with those determined from equilibrium measurements. A comparison ofQ values indicates that the coupling constants determined from pre-steady state kinetics are consistent with those obtained from steady state measurements (7Johnson J.L. Reinhart G.D.

Open table in a new tab The mechanism that drives the interaction of Fru-6-P with PEP/PFK appears to differ from the mechanism that drives the interaction of PEP with Fru-6-P/PFK. Fru-6-P yields a hyperbolic rate dependence mechanism regardless of the liganded state of the enzyme, whether free PFK or a PEP·PFK or MgADP·PFK complex. Conversely, the rate dependence profiles for allosteric effectors yield a one-step mechanism regardless of whether the effector ligand interacts with the free enzyme or with the PFK·Fru-6-P complex. Thus, whereas the observed rate constants for substrate and effector participating in a ternary interaction lie between those for each ligand participating in a binary interaction independently, the rate dependence patterns do not reflect this hybrid characteristic. However, a close examination of both binding events indicates that both ternary interactions followed the same mechanism. Consider the binding of Fru-6-P to the PFK·PEP complex. First, in the presence of low PEP concentrations, Fru-6-P appears to “bump off” PEP and to bind exclusively to the free enzyme. Dramatic decreases in the forward and reverse isomerization rate constants k3 andk4, respectively, suggest that not much Fru-6-P·PFK′·PEP complex is being formed. Second, theK1 value at the low PEP concentrations, which is similar to the K1 value observed for Fru-6-P binding to the free enzyme, suggests that Fru-6-P·PFK is being formed exclusively. The K1 value rises dramatically at PEP concentrations above 1 mm, indicating that PEP is binding directly to the Fru-6-P·PFK complex. A rise ink3 implies the formation of the Fru-6-P·PFK′·PEP complex. The k4 value also increases, but not by more than the k3, possibly indicating that the predominant species in the solution is the Fru-6-P·PFK·PEP complex rather than Fru-6-P·PFK′·PEP. For PEP concentrations above 10 mm, K1levels off to a saturable level, probably reflecting the ternary complex form. These results suggest that the allosteric influence of PEP on the binding of the substrate to the enzyme does not occur predominantly through a subsequent conformational change, as might be expected under the classical allosteric theory (2Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar, 20Koshland Jr., D.E. Nemethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar). Rather, differences in signals reflect the changing species population. A parallel argument can be made for the binding of PEP to the Fru-6-P·PFK complex. With increasing Fru-6-P concentrations, the decreasing kon is offset by increasingkoff and could indicate a displacement of PEP and a binding on Fru-6-P. However, the leveling of thekon rate constant observed at Fru-6-P concentrations above 1 mm indicates the formation of a ternary complex. Thus, results derived from either Fru-6-P or PEP binding to the PFK binary complex suggest the same conclusion, the formation of a Fru-6-P·PFK·PEP ternary complex. In addition, the rate constants measured during these processes are fully consistent with the equilibrium values we determined previously for the allosteric effects of PEP on Fru-6-P binding. The displacement model of Auzat et al. (24Auzat I. Gawlita E. Garel J.-R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which describes the mutually exclusive binding of PEP and Fru-6-P to the enzyme, is not entirely inconsistent with our view. Indeed, our results show evidence for ligand displacement at low Fru-6-P and PEP concentrations. Auzatet al. (24Auzat I. Gawlita E. Garel J.-R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), however, overlooked additional transitions of the Fru-6-P/PEP interactions, because only two concentrations of PEP (0.5 and 2 mm) were used with either 0.025 or 0.1 mm Fru-6-P. Hence, the changes resulting from Fru-6-P/PEP interaction appeared two-state. Equation 2 predicts that high concentrations of both ligands are needed to obtain an appreciable population of the ternary complex. Indeed, this prediction is supported by our experiments, wherein saturation levels were observed for PEP concentrations above 30 mm and for Fru-6-P concentrations above 1 mm. The displacement model of Auzat et al. (24Auzat I. Gawlita E. Garel J.-R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was based on the MWC prediction that inhibitor and substrate cannot bind to the same enzyme form. Our results show that whereas the MWC two-state model accounts for some aspects of allosteric properties, it is far from a complete and accurate depiction of allosteric influence. The MWC two-state theory presupposes that PEP stabilizes theT form PFK, whereas MgADP and Fru-6-P stabilize theR form. Transitions between the alleged R andT forms would predictably yield the same rate constants for the forward and reverse isomerization steps. However, our data indicate that the rate constants for the presumed R to Ttransition were not the same as those for the T toR transition. On the contrary, each ligand interaction with PFK yields distinct forward and reverse rate constants. Thus, to conserve the working MWC two-state model, other authors (24Auzat I. Gawlita E. Garel J.-R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 32Lau F.T.-K. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6841-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) resort to assigning a sub-classification of the R andT PFK forms for each ligand interaction. For example, it is assumed that Fru-6-P binds to the R form. However, a newRf form is invoked as an attempt to account for the two-state mechanism of the Fru-6-P interaction with PFK. The distinction between the R and Rf states is the high and low fluorescence, where high and low fluorescence states presumably correspond to the increase and decrease, respectively, of fluorescence intensity emission upon the binding of a ligand. This assignment is arbitrary, since the binding of Fru-6-P was not known to cause an increase and then a decrease in fluorescence. Allosteric action can be adequately explained without such a model being invoked. Given that the enzyme reacts to each species specifically, the minimum number of conformations to describe an allosteric action is four as follows: free enzyme, enzyme-substrate, enzyme-effector, and substrate-enzyme-effector, in which an effector may be an inhibitor or an activator. Pre-steady state studies can provide insights into whether the influence of an allosteric ligand on substrate binding affinity necessitates additional intermediate steps unique to each effector ligand or whether allosteric ligand acts through modification of existing rate constants for substrate binding. Our results indicate that activation and inhibition by allosteric ligands occur by essentially the same mechanism; each modifies the existing rate constants and forms the ternary complex."
