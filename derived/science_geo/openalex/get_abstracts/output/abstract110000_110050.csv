https://openalex.org/W1992494470,"In a search for genes that regulate circadian rhythms in mammals, the progeny of mice treated with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) were screened for circadian clock mutations. A semidominant mutation, Clock, that lengthens circadian period and abolishes persistence of rhythmicity was identified. Clock segregated as a single gene that mapped to the midportion of mouse chromosome 5, a region syntenic to human chromosome 4. The power of ENU mutagenesis combined with the ability to clone murine genes by map position provides a generally applicable approach to study complex behavior in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1983352401,"An elastomeric stamp, containing defined features on the micrometer scale, was used to imprint gold surfaces with specific patterns of self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiols and, thereby, to create islands of defined shape and size that support extracellular matrix protein adsorption and cell attachment. Through this technique, it was possible to place cells in predetermined locations and arrays, separated by defined distances, and to dictate their shape. Limiting the degree of cell extension provided control over cell growth and protein secretion. This method is experimentally simple and highly adaptable. It should be useful for applications in biotechnology that require analysis of individual cells cultured at high density or repeated access to cells placed in specified locations."
https://openalex.org/W2036180570,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by abnormal clonal myeloid proliferation and by progression to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). CMML thus offers an opportunity to study early genetic events in the transition to AML. A recently recognized subgroup of CMML has a t(5;12)(q33;p13) balanced translocation. We report that the consequence of the t(5;12) translocation is expression of a fusion transcript in which the tyrosine kinase domain of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR beta) on chromosome 5 is coupled to a novel ets-like gene, tel, on chromosome 12. The tel-PDGFR beta fusion demonstrates the oncogenic potential of PDGFR beta and may provide a paradigm for early events in the pathogenesis of AML."
https://openalex.org/W1984925149,"A gene, reaper (rpr), that appears to play a central control function for the initiation of programmed cell death (apoptosis) in Drosophila was identified. Virtually all programmed cell death that normally occurs during Drosophila embryogenesis was blocked in embryos homozygous for a small deletion that includes the reaper gene. Mutant embryos contained many extra cells and failed to hatch, but many other aspects of development appeared quite normal. Deletions that include reaper also protected embryos from apoptosis caused by x-irradiation and developmental defects. However, high doses of x-rays induced some apoptosis in mutant embryos, and the resulting corpses were phagocytosed by macrophages. These data suggest that the basic cell death program is intact although it was not activated in mutant embryos. The DNA encompassed by the deletion was cloned and the reaper gene was identified on the basis of the ability of cloned DNA to restore apoptosis to cell death defective embryos in germ line transformation experiments. The reaper gene appears to encode a small peptide that shows no homology to known proteins, and reaper messenger RNA is expressed in cells destined to undergo apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2050842983,"The in vivo function of murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was investigated in mice, carrying a null allele of the GM-CSF gene, that were generated by gene targeting techniques in embryonic stem cells. Although steady-state hematopoiesis was unimpaired in homozygous mutant animals, all animals developed the progressive accumulation of surfactant lipids and proteins in the alveolar space, the defining characteristic of the idiopathic human disorder pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Extensive lymphoid hyperplasia associated with lung airways and blood vessels was also found, yet no infectious agents could be detected. These results demonstrate that GM-CSF is not an essential growth factor for basal hematopoiesis and reveal an unexpected, critical role for GM-CSF in pulmonary homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2105409819,"We describe a novel gene, Blimp-1 (for B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein), transcripts of which are rapidly induced during the differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulin secretory cells and whose expression is characteristic of late B and plasma cell lines. The 856 amino acid open reading frame contains five Krüppel-type zinc finger motifs and proline-rich and acidic regions similar to those of known transcription factors. Serological studies show an approximately 100 kd protein that localizes to the nucleus. Stable or transient transfection of Blimp-1 into B cell lymphoma lines leads to the expression of many of the phenotypic changes associated with B cell differentiation into an early plasma cell stage, including induction of J chain message and immunoglobulin secretion, up-regulation of Syndecan-1, and increased cell size and granularity. Thus, Blimp-1 appears to be a pleiotropic regulatory factor capable of at least partially driving the terminal differentiation of B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2033418096,"In the accompanying paper, we show that the expression of a dominant negative activin receptor can convert prospective ectoderm into neural tissue, which suggests that activin is an inhibitor of neuralization. Here we report the isolation and characterization of an activin antagonist, follistatin, that can induce neural tissue directly in vivo. Follistatin RNA is localized in the Spemann organizer and notochord, tissues known to be potent neural inducers. We demonstrate that follistatin RNA and protein are able to block the activity of activin in embryonic explants. Furthermore, we show that follistatin RNA directly neuralizes ectodermal explants in the absence of detectable mesoderm. Thus, follistatin is present at the correct time and location to play a role in neural induction in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1974471630,"Single molecules of DNA, visualized in video fluorescence microscopy, were stretched to full extension in a flow, and their relaxation was measured when the flow stopped. The molecules, attached by one end to a 1-micrometer bead, were manipulated in an aqueous solution with optical tweezers. Inverse Laplace transformations of the relaxation data yielded spectra of decaying exponentials with distinct peaks, and the longest time component (tau) increased with length (L) as tau approximately L 1.68 +/- 0.10. A rescaling analysis showed that most of the relaxation curves had a universal shape and their characteristic times (lambda t) increased as lambda t approximately L 1.65 +/- 0.13. These results are in qualitative agreement with the theoretical prediction of dynamical scaling."
https://openalex.org/W2070154589,"Tube-like motion of a single, fluorescently labeled molecule of DNA in an entangled solution of unlabeled lambda-phage DNA molecules was observed by fluorescence microscopy. One end of a 16- to 100-micrometer-long DNA was attached to a 1-micrometer bead and moved with optical tweezers. The molecule was stretched into various conformations having bends, kinks, and loops. As the polymer relaxed, it closely followed a path defined by its initial contour. The relaxation time of the disturbance caused by the bead was roughly 1 second, whereas tube-like motion in small loops persisted for longer than 2 minutes. Tube deformation, constraint release, and excess chain segment diffusion were also observed. These observations provide direct evidence for several key assumptions in the reptation model developed by de Gennes, Edwards, and Doi."

https://openalex.org/W2086699946,"Duration is a biologically important feature of sound. Some neurons in the inferior colliculus of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, are tuned to sound duration, but it is unclear at what level the tuning originates or what neural mechanisms are responsible for it. The application of antagonists of the inhibitory neurotransmitters γ-aminobutyric acid or glycine to neurons in the inferior colliculus eliminated duration tuning. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of synaptic currents suggested that inhibition produces a temporal frame within which excitation can occur. A model is proposed in which duration tuning arises when an early, sustained inhibitory input interacts with a delayed, transient excitatory input."
https://openalex.org/W1981366355,"To facilitate molecular genetic analysis of vertebrate development, haploid genetics was used to construct a recombination map for the zebrafish Danio (Brachydanio) rerio. The map consists of 401 random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) and 13 simple sequence repeats spaced at an average interval of 5.8 centimorgans. Strategies that exploit the advantages of haploid genetics and RAPD markers were developed that quickly mapped lethal and visible mutations and that placed cloned genes on the map. This map is useful for the position-based cloning of mutant genes, the characterization of chromosome rearrangements, and the investigation of evolution in vertebrate genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2006796214,"By conventional spike count measures, auditory neurons in the cat's anterior ectosylvian sulcus cortical area are broadly tuned for the location of a sound source. Nevertheless, an artificial neural network was trained to classify the temporal spike patterns of single neurons according to sound location. The spike patterns of 73 percent of single neurons coded sound location with more than twice the chance level of accuracy, and spike patterns consistently carried more information than spike counts alone. In contrast to neurons that are sharply tuned for location, these neurons appear to encode sound locations throughout 360 degrees of azimuth."
https://openalex.org/W2116563193,"Renal sodium metabolism, a major determinant of blood pressure, is regulated with great precision by a variety of endocrine, autocrine, and neuronal factors. Although these factors are known to regulate sodium metabolism by affecting the rate of tubular sodium reabsorption, the molecular mechanisms by which they act are poorly understood. Na+,K(+)-ATPase plays a pivotal role for sodium reabsorption in all tubular segments. The activity of this enzyme can be dynamically regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Here we summarize both old and new evidence that several major substances believed to be involved in the regulation of sodium metabolism and blood pressure, i.e., the antidiuretic agents angiotensin II and norepinephrine, and the diuretic agents dopamine and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), may achieve their effects through a common pathway that involves reversible activation/deactivation of renal tubular Na+,K(+)-ATPase. Regulation of Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity was studied using a preparation of single proximal tubule (PT) segments, dissected from rat kidneys. Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity was stimulated by angiotensin II and the alpha-adrenergic agonist, oxymetazoline, at physiological, nonsaturating Na+ concentrations. These stimulatory effects were blocked by dopamine and ANP as well as by their respective second messengers, cAMP and cGMP. They were also blocked by the specific protein phosphatase 2B inhibitor FK506. These results indicate that regulation of sodium excretion by norepinephrine, angiotensin II, dopamine, and ANP can be accounted for by a bidirectionally regulated intracellular protein phosphorylation cascade that modulates the activity of renal tubular Na+,K(+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1490046471,"The 165-amino acid form of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) is a mitogen for vascular endothelial cells and a potent angiogenic factor. Expression of a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of the flk-1 receptor fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the human c-fms receptor in NIH-3T3 cells, resulted in the appearance of high affinity binding sites for 125I-VEGF165 on transfected cells. The binding of 125I-VEGF165 to the flk-1/fms chimeric receptor of the transfected cells as well as the VEGF165-induced autophosphorylation of the chimeric receptors were inhibited in the presence of low concentrations of heparin (1-10 micrograms/ml). In contrast, similar concentrations of heparin potentiated the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to the endogenous VEGF receptors of the transfected cells, indicating that to some extent, the effect of heparin on 125I-VEGF165 binding is receptor type-dependent. A soluble fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of flk-1 fused to alkaline phosphatase (flk-1/SEAP) was used to study the effects of heparin on the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to flk-1 in a cell-free environment. The fusion protein specifically inhibited VEGF165-induced proliferation of vascular endothelial cells, but bound 125I-VEGF165 inefficiently in the absence of heparin. Addition of low concentrations of heparin or heparan sulfate (0.1-1 microgram/ml) resulted in a strong potentiation of 125I-VEGF165 binding, whereas higher heparin or heparan sulfate concentrations inhibited the binding. The effect of heparin on the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to flk-1/SEAP could not be mimicked by desulfated heparin or by chondroitin sulfate. Both bFGF and aFGF inhibited the binding when low concentrations of heparin were added to the binding reaction. However, higher concentrations of heparin abolished the inhibition, indicating that the inhibition is probably caused by competition for available heparin. Taken as a whole, these results indicate that heparin-like molecules regulate the binding of VEGF165 to its receptors in complex ways which depend on the heparin binding properties of VEGF165, on the specific VEGF receptor type involved, and on the amount and composition of heparin-like molecules that are present on the cell surface of VEGF receptor containing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1645482826,"Post-translational modifications of the water-soluble human lens crystallins from young adult donors were identified and located using electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis of the intact proteins and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of enzymatic digests. Peptides corresponding to all of the sequences of alpha A-, alpha B-, and beta B2-crystallins were found, permitting the entire sequences to be searched for modifications. The major portions of these three crystallins were not modified. Modifications of alpha A-crystallin that were detected included 2 phosphorylated Ser residues (1 of which appears to be unique to human lenses), deamidation at some Gln and Asn residues, a disulfide bond between Cys-131 and Cys-142, and loss of the COOH-terminal Ser residue. Three phosphorylated Ser residues, but no deamidation, were found in alpha B-crystallin. The molecular weights of neither the intact protein nor the peptides in the enzymatic digests indicated any post-translational modification of the principal beta-crystallin, beta B2. The molecular weights of the other beta- and gamma-crystallins for which sequences have been published suggested the presence of post-translational modifications or errors in the published sequences. Although enough peptides were found to establish the presence of specific proteins, peptides corresponding to all portions of these proteins were not found, and elucidation of these structures is not yet complete. This mass spectrometric characterization of the total water-soluble proteins from normal young adult lenses provides a reference data base for future investigations of the modifications present in aged and cataractous lenses."
https://openalex.org/W2074619593,Tumor immunotherapy should increase both the number of T cells that kill the tumor and the likelihood that those cells are activated at the tumor site. Bispecific monoclonal antibodies (Bi-mAbs) were designed that bound to a Hodgkin's tumor-associated antigen (CD30) on the tumor and to either CD3 or CD28 on the T cell. Immunodeficient mice were cured of established human tumors when mice were treated with both the CD3-CD30 and the CD28-CD30 Bi-mAbs and then given human peripheral blood lymphocytes that had been incubated with the CD3-CD30 Bi-mAb and cells that expressed CD30. The enrichment of human T cells within the tumor and the fact that established tumors can be cured may indicate in situ activation of both the T cell receptor and the costimulatory pathway.
https://openalex.org/W1482410919,"The active form of pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) from Escherichia coli contains a glycyl radical in position 734 of the polypeptide chain which is produced post-translationally by pyruvate formate-lyase-activating enzyme (PFL activase) using S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and dihydroflavodoxin as co-substrates (Wagner, A.F. V., Frey, M., Neugebauer, F.A., Schafer, W., and Knappe, J. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 996-1000). Studying radical synthesis with [2-2H]glycine-labeled PFL, we have now found stoichiometric incorporation of a 2H atom into the 5‘-deoxyadenosine (dAdo) co-product via mass and NMR spectroscopic analyses. Furthermore, a series of peptides homologous to the Gly-734 site of PFL have been synthesized for analyzing recognition determinants of PFL activase. Peptides that proved active as substrates (monitored by [14C]dAdo formation from [14C]AdoMet) were also competitive inhibitors of PFL conversion to the radical form. In the sequence of the standard peptide Arg-Val-Ser-Gly-Tyr-Ala-Val, which corresponds to amino acid residues 731-737 of PFL, the Gly residue was replaceable by D-Ala (actually displaying enhanced efficiency), whereas a normal Ala totally abolished the interaction with PFL activase. Our results show that the radical in pyruvate formatelyase is produced by stereospecific abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen of glycine 734 by the 5‘-dAdo radical generated in the active center of PFL activase. Gly-734 is probably located in a beta-turn segment of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2052566941,"Inwardly rectifying potassium (K+) channels (IRKs) maintain the resting membrane potential of cells and permit prolonged depolarization, such as during the cardiac action potential. Inward rectification may result from block of the ion conduction pore by intracellular magnesium (Mgi2+). Two members of this family, IRK1 and ROMK1, which share 40 percent amino acid identity, differ markedly in single-channel K+ conductance and sensitivity to block by Mgi2+. The conserved H5 regions were hypothesized to determine these pore properties because they have this function in voltage-dependent K+ channels and in cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. However, exchange of the H5 region between IRK1 and ROMK1 had no effect on rectification and little or no effect on K+ conductance. By contrast, exchange of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions together transferred Mg2+ blockade and K+ conductance of IRK1 to ROMK1. Exchange of the carboxyl but not the amino terminus had a similar effect. Therefore, the carboxyl terminus appears to have a major role in specifying the pore properties of IRKs."
https://openalex.org/W1508099208,"Ligands that bind mammalian cell surface integrins with high affinity can mediate cellular internalization. We show that particles of the bacteriophage fd that display the cyclic integrin-binding peptide sequence GGCRGDMFGC in a proportion of their major coat protein subunits bind to cells and are efficiently internalized. In the displayed peptide the conformation of the RGD motif is restricted within a hairpin loop formed by a disulfide bridge between the 2 cysteine residues. Cellular internalization of phage was demonstrated by confocal and non-confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of tissue-cultured cells incubated with phage particles. The phage were contained in juxtanuclear vesicles in the same serial sections as transferrin receptor but were not colocalized with the cell surface marker alkaline phosphatase. Cell binding and internalization was inhibited by preincubation of cells with the integrin-binding peptide GRGDSP, whereas the control peptide GRGESP had no inhibitory effect. These results indicate that cyclic integrin-binding peptides can be used to target and enter cells and that it should be possible to exploit such peptides for the introduction of DNA, drugs, or other macromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W1570592780,"The insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-I-R) has been implicated in the etiology and/or progression of Wilms' tumor, a pediatric malignancy of the kidney that is often associated with deletion or mutation of the WT1 tumor suppressor gene. The expression of the IGF-I-R gene is increased in Wilms' tumor as compared with normal kidney tissue. Furthermore, the levels of IGF-I-R mRNA in individual tumors have been shown to be inversely correlated to the levels of WT1 mRNA, suggesting that the expression of the IGF-I-R gene is under the negative control of WT1. The activity of an IGF-I-R promoter/luciferase construct in Chinese hamster ovary cells was reduced by cotransfection of a WT1 expression vector. An analysis of various reporter constructs containing different portions of the IGF-I-R 5'-flanking and 5'-untranslated regions suggested that the effect of WT1 depends on the number of WT1 binding sites present, with sites located both upstream and downstream of the IGF-I-R transcription start site involved in mediating this effect. Using the purified zinc finger domain of WT1 in gel retardation and DNase I footprinting assays, we mapped five sites in the 5'-flanking and six sites in the 5'-untranslated regions that were involved in WT1 binding. In addition, the initiator element of the IGF-I-R gene contains a sequence that binds WT1. Thus, the repression of IGF-I-R promoter activity by the WT1 tumor suppressor gene product involves multiple interactions of its zinc finger domain with WT1 binding sites located both 5' and 3' of the transcription initiation site."
https://openalex.org/W1493067897,"Mammalian smooth muscles, like invertebrate catch muscles, dynamically regulate the rate of cross-bridge cycling. During sustained contractions, cross-bridge cycling rates may decrease severalfold, whereas tension remains elevated (latch-state). Physiologic studies have shown that decreased cycling rate is frequently, but not always, associated with dephosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton light chain of myosin. Tropomyosin, caldesmon, and calponin are actin-binding proteins found in mammalian smooth muscles that modulate actin-activated myosin ATPase activity in vitro and may modulate cross-bridge cycling in situ. Using an in vitro motility assay in combination with a new method for estimating relative changes in the force exerted on actin filaments, the present study demonstrates that the effects of calponin on actin filament motility are: increased actin filament binding to thiophosphorylated smooth muscle myosin, decreased filament velocity from 2.0 to 0.74 microns/s, and a 3-4-fold increase in the force exerted on stationary actin filaments. Taken together, these observations suggest that calponin inhibits the rate of dissociation of the high-affinity actomyosin complex and, consequently, that it may be an integral component of the latch-state in mammalian smooth muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1635320150,"Abstract Cysteine farnesylation of the ras oncogene product, p21ras, on its carboxyl-terminal CA1A2X box (C = cysteine, A = aliphatic, and X = methionine or serine) is required for its transforming activity. p21ras farnesyltransferase (FTase), the enzyme responsible or this important posttranslational modification can be inhibited by simple CA1A2X peptides. We have synthesized a family of CA1A2X peptidomimetics where the central 2 aliphatic amino acids are replaced by a variety of spacer groups with different shapes and conformational characteristics to investigate the structural requirements of these inhibitors. The biological activities of CA1A2X peptidomimetics, where the dipeptide A1A2 is replaced by 3- or 4-aminomethylbenzoic acid (AMBA) and 3- or 4-aminobenzoic acid (ABA), are evaluated in a p21ras FTase inhibitory assay. Peptidomimetics Cys-4-ABA-Met and Cys-3-AMBA-Met contain spacers that provide good distance correspondence of the carboxylate and ammonium separation with that of the parent KB p21ras tetrapeptide, Cys-Val-Ile-Met, and are as potent FTase inhibitors (IC50 values of 50 and 100 nM, respectively). In contrast, replacing the central dipeptide with 4-AMBA reduced FTase inhibitory activity by 17-fold whereas replacement by 3-ABA reduces inhibitory activity of the peptidomimetics by 43-fold. Cys-4-ABA-Met (IC50 = 50 nM) is 128 times more potent as a p21ras FTase inhibitor than Cys-3-ABA-Met (IC50 = 6400 nM), yet these two peptidomimetics differ only in the substitution pattern around the phenyl ring. These results coupled with computer modeling studies demonstrate that the interaction between FTase and the peptidomimetics requires precise structural and conformational characteristics; in particular, correct positioning of the Cys and Met must be respected. Furthermore, Cys-3-AMBA-Met and Cys-4-ABA-Met are true inhibitors of p21ras FTase since they are not farnesylated by this enzyme, in contrast to Cys-Val-Ile-Met, which inhibits the enzyme by acting as alternative substrate. Computer modeling studies of the potent FTase inhibitor Cys-4-ABA-Met show that a folded conformation, where the thiol and carboxylate groups are close, is not possible. Therefore a beta-turn conformation that would result in the simultaneous coordination of the Cys-thiol and Met-carboxylate to zinc ion is not important for inhibition of p21ras FTase, as previously suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1548475368,"After insulin stimulation of rat HTC hepatoma cells overexpressing normal human insulin receptors (IR), an antiserum to the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PIK) (alpha-p85) immunoprecipitated three major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins: IR, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and a new 62-kDa protein (p62). Studies with antibodies to GTPase activating protein (alpha-GAP) and p62 GAP-associated protein suggested that p62 was the same as (or closely related to) p62 GAP-associated protein. In order to understand how p62 interacts with p85, we employed: 1) antibodies to the p110 subunit of PIK (alpha-p110); and 2) antiserum to IRS-1. To determine which subunit of PIK (p110 or p85) p62 associates with, we first immunoprecipitated insulin-treated cell lysates with alpha-p110 and subsequently immunoprecipitated with alpha-p85 followed by Western blotting analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (alpha-PY). In response to insulin, most of the tyrosine-phosphorylated p62 was complexed to p85 alone rather than with the PIK heterodimer. Moreover, p62 was absent in alpha-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates. These data suggest that: 1) p62 GAP-associated protein is tyrosine phosphorylated after insulin stimulation of cells; 2) p62 and IRS-1 form separate complexes with p85; 3) p62-GAP complex may be linked to p85 that is not bound to p110; 4) p85 may serve as an adaptor molecule in insulin receptor signaling, interacting with and regulating other intracellular proteins via SH2 domains."
https://openalex.org/W1539719002,"In Escherichia coli the ompF gene encodes a major outer membrane porin protein that is differentially regulated by the OmpR protein. OmpR acts as a positive as well as a negative regulator of ompF expression by binding to DNA sequences in the ompF promoter region. The DNA binding activity of OmpR is itself regulated by phosphorylation through the kinase protein EnvZ. Phosphorylation is believed to change the function of OmpR from an activator to a repressor molecule. By using purified OmpR and various regions of the ompF promoter we show that phosphorylation causes binding of OmpR to a DNA region between the -40 to -100 region of the ompF promoter previously shown to be important for ompF expression. As the amount of OmpR-phosphate increases, a binding site located at a further upstream -360 to -380 region was occupied. This latter site has been reported to be important for ompF repression. Further experiments indicate that the -70 to -100 region is a high affinity site, while the -45 to -60 and -360 to -380 regions are low affinity sites. We also provide evidence that OmpR binding at the -360 to -380 region requires previous binding at downstream sequences, which is indicative of long range interactions between OmpR molecules. We interpret our results in terms of a model for ompF regulation involving hierarchical binding by phosphorylated OmpR and potential DNA looping."
https://openalex.org/W1524299271,"In this study, we examined protein phosphatase 1 (PP-1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP-2A) activities during various stages of myogenesis and their regulation by insulin in rat skeletal muscle cells. Protein phosphatase activities were measured using 32P-labeled phosphorylase a, glycogen synthase, and phosphorylase kinase as substrates. Spontaneous PP-1 activity increased progressively in cultures from 2 to 5 days, PP-2A activities remained constant in days 2-4 cultures and increased sharply on day 5. Most of the times in culture, a significant proportion (approximately 65%) of PP-1 was in a form that could be activated by trypsin. Insulin stimulated PP-1 activity (40-80% increase over basal) in a time (t1/2 approximately 5 min)- and dose (EC50 approximately 0.1 nM)-dependent manner. Insulin activation of PP-1 was accompanied by a corresponding inhibition in PP-2A activity. The effects of insulin on PP-1 and PP-2A were differentiation dependent and were observed only in cells at fusion (day 5) and post-fusion. The insulin's effect on PP-1 correlated with the gradual appearance of PP-1 G subunit in cells at fusion. Immunoprecipitation of PP-1 from 32P-labeled cells with an antibody directed against the site 1 sequence of rabbit skeletal muscle PP-1G detected a 160-kDa protein, phosphorylation of which was significantly increased by insulin. This correlated well with the increase observed in immunoprecipitated PP-1G activity. Treatment of cells with a cAMP agonist (SpcAMP) completely blocked activation of PP-1 by insulin and diminished insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the 160-kDa protein. The likely identity of the 160-kDa band as the regulatory subunit of PP-1 was confirmed by assay of PP-1 activity in the immunoprecipitates and by competition studies with the site 1 peptide against which the antibody was made. From these studies, we conclude that insulin activates PP-1 in L6 cells by increasing the phosphorylation of its regulatory subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1593538558,"The 240-kDa proteasome inhibitor has been reported to be an ATP-stabilized component (CF-2) of the 26 S proteasome complex. We now report that this inhibitory factor is indistinguishable from delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), the second enzyme in the pathway of heme synthesis, based upon the following observations: 1) common sequence of the first 14 N-terminal amino acids; 2) identical migration on native and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; 3) identical isoelectric points of pH 7.1; 4) cross-reactivity of specific polyclonal antibodies; 5) similar dehydratase and proteasome inhibitor specific activities in both proteins; and 6) the presence of both activities in recombinant ALAD. The dual role of this protein as CF-2 in the ATP/ubiquitin-dependent pathway and in heme synthesis may be an example of gene sharing and explains the unexpected abundance of ALAD noted in earlier studies."
https://openalex.org/W2128322752,"The functional significance of the isoform diversity of the calmodulin-dependent plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMGA) is largely unknown. To determine whether the mRNA synthesis of different isoforms of the enzyme is regulated in a differentiation-specific manner, we investigated the expression of isoform-specific mRNAs in muscle and neuronal cells during differentiation by reverse transcription PCR. In the rat, the ubiquitous PMCA splicing variants 1b and 4b formed the typical PMCA isoform pattern of L6 myoblasts, the heart-derived cell line H9c2(2-1), two different fibroblast cell lines (FR and NRK-49F), smooth muscle, and endothelial cells. In addition to these two enzymes, novel expression of the splicing variants 1c, 1d, and 4a was induced during myogenic Differentiation of L6 and H9c2(2-1) cells. A similar isoform subtype switch could be detected during differentiation of the neuronal PC-12 cells induced by nerve growth factor (NGF). The isoform-specific mRNAs 1c, 1d, and 4a were not expressed in cells other than myocytes and neurons, and therefore may be specific for excitable cells. The mRNA for isoform 1d was heart- and skeletal muscle-specific. To determine whether expression of a differentiation-specific PMCA mRNA pattern is under control of a myogenic determination factor, myogenin was constitutively expressed in rat fibroblasts. These cells converted to multinucleated myotubes, which displayed the PMCA isoform-specific mRNAs 1c, 1d, and 4a, typical of differentiated muscle cells. We conclude that: 1) the distribution of the various PMCA isoform-specific mRNAs and their splicing variants is cell type- and development-specific; 2) expression of the myogenic determination factor myogenin is sufficient to direct alternative splicing generating muscle-specific PMCA mRNA species; and 3) PMCA isoforms and/or splicing variants may play a role in determining functions of terminally differentiated muscle and neuronal cells and possibly during the differentiation process itself.—Hammes, A., Oberdorf, S., Strehler, E.

https://openalex.org/W2035449617,"Microtubule dynamic instability underlies many cellular functions, including spindle morphogenesis and chromosome movement. The role of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis in dynamic instability was investigated by introduction of four mutations into yeast β-tubulin at amino acids 103 to 109, a site thought to participate in GTP hydrolysis. Three of the mutations increased both the assembly-dependent rate of GTP hydrolysis and the average length of steady-state microtubules over time, a measure of dynamic instability. The fourth mutation did not substantially affect the rate of GTP hydrolysis or the steady-state microtubule lengths. These results demonstrate that the rate of GTP hydrolysis can modulate microtubule length and hence dynamic instability."
https://openalex.org/W1580662746,"The molecular basis for endothelin (ET) isopeptide selectivity between ETA and ETB receptors was studied by examining ligand binding to several site-specific mutants of the human ETA receptor. Based on a computer-built three-dimensional model of the ETA receptor, five non-conserved amino acids, clustered around the putative ligand binding site, were targeted for mutation to alanine. Expression of the wild-type and mutant ETA receptors in COS-7 cells revealed that the binding profile of one of the ETA mutants, Tyr129-->Ala, was characteristic of the ETB receptor. In the Tyr129-->Ala ETA receptor mutant the affinity of two ETB-selective agonists, endothelin-3 and sarafotoxin S6c, was increased 10-200-fold, whereas that for two ETA-selective antagonists, BQ-123 and BMS-182874, was reduced 350-2,000-fold. Thus, mutation of a single amino acid in the second transmembrane region of the wild-type ETA receptor results in subtype conversion. In addition, these data represent the first example of peptide interactions with a transmembrane region of a G protein-coupled receptor and indicate that Tyr129, located in the second transmembrane region of the ETA receptor, is a critical component for determination of endothelin receptor subtype-selective ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W1952761671,"Transgenic mice expressing the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)/human insulin chimeric gene have been obtained as a model to study the feasibility of gene therapy for diabetes. These transgenic animals were healthy and normoglycemic and expressed human insulin in a physiologically regulated manner, mainly in the liver. Streptozotocin-treated transgenic mice had high levels of human insulin immunoreactivity in serum and showed a significant decrease (up to 40%) in glycemia compared with streptozotocin-treated control mice. The expression of genes involved in liver glucose metabolism, such as glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, and PEPCK, which is markedly altered by diabetes, was significantly recovered in transgenic mice treated with streptozotocin. In addition, the activity of both glucokinase and glycogen synthase, and the content of glucose 6-phosphate and glycogen, were normal in the liver, even when transgenic animals were treated with diabetogenic doses of streptozotocin. These results constitute an indication in vivo that diabetes gene therapy is possible, by means of the production of insulin in extrapancreatic tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1531303582,"Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR, m2 subtype) are phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GR kinase) at sites located in the central part of mAChR. The GR kinase phosphorylated a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the m2 phosphorylation sites (13-GST). Phosphorylation of 13-GST was markedly stimulated by mastoparan: the Km for 13-GST decreased from 7.3 to 0.17 microM in the presence of 100 microM mastroparan and the Vmax increased 23-fold. beta gamma Subunits of G proteins synergistically stimulated the phosphorylation of 13-GST in the presence of 1-10 microM mastoparan by increasing the affinity of mastoparan for the GR kinase. The phosphorylation of mAChR by the GR kinase was also synergistically stimulated by 1-10 microM mastoparan in the presence of beta gamma subunits, but was inhibited by 100 microM mastoparan. Similar stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the phosphorylation of 13-GST and mAChR were observed using synthetic peptides of 15-20 amino acid residues corresponding to sequences of intracellular segments adjacent to the transmembrane segments of mAChR. These results are consistent with and support the idea that the GR kinase is synergistically activated by both G protein beta gamma subunits and agonist-bound receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1528553045,"The Na+/sulfate cotransporter cloned from rat kidney cortex (NaSi-1) has been expressed in oocytes of Xenopus laevis and subjected to electrophysiological analysis by current and voltage clamp methods. In current-clamped oocytes, superfusion with 1 mM sulfate resulted in a 12-mV depolarization of the cell membrane. Accordingly, in voltage-clamped oocytes sulfate induced an inward current IS, which was dependent on both the concentration of Na+ and sulfate in the superfusate. Half-maximal IS was observed at about 0.1 mM sulfate and 70 mM Na+. The Hill coefficients were 1 and 2.8 for sulfate and Na+, respectively. Thiosulfate and selenate created similar currents as sulfate with a similar Km. At saturating concentrations of thiosulfate and selenate, addition of sulfate could not induce an additive current. Phosphate (1 mM) did not inhibit sulfate-induced currents. Finally, IS was dependent on the holding potential being larger at more negative potentials. The results of this study strongly suggest an electrogenic cotransport of sulfate and Na+ with a stoichiometry of 1:3."
https://openalex.org/W1483604106,"All heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) share two regions of homology, identified as the DNA binding and trimerization regions. The DNA binding region consists of two parts, an 89-amino-acid minimal DNA-binding domain and an additional 21 amino acids which are not necessary for specific DNA binding of a monomeric DNA-binding domain. These 21 amino acids may act as a flexible linker between the DNA-binding and trimerization domains. Saccharomyces cerevisiae HSF has an additional 52 amino acids between the proposed flexible linker and the trimerization domain. Deletion of this unique region has no effect on the structural integrity or essential in vivo functions of HSF. To investigate the role of the 21-amino-acid proposed linker, a series of internal deletions was created in fragments containing the DNA-binding and trimerization domains. The deletions have no effect on the structural integrity of the protein as assayed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. However, alterations of the linker do affect affinity of trimeric HSF binding to its target DNA. In addition, deletion of part or all of the proposed linker from full-length yeast HSF, an essential protein, disrupts growth of yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1504042724,"A fusion protein containing the full-length sequences of the mitogen, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), and the ribosome-inactivating protein, saporin (SAP), has been expressed in E. coli. As expected, it binds with high affinity to heparin-Sepharose like FGF-2 and can displace the binding of radiolabeled FGF-2 to its high affinity receptor. In contrast, the fusion protein only has much lower ribosome-inactivating activity than free saporin, although full ribosome-inactivating protein activity can be generated by proteolytic removal of the FGF-2 moiety. Cytotoxicity experiments with B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells establish that the fusion protein is active as a chemical conjugate against these intact cells. Presumably these cells have the ability to activate the SAP component of the fusion protein through an intra-cellular metabolism of the fusion protein. Because we also show the fusion protein has tumor growth inhibition properties and antimetastatic activity in in vivo models of melanoma, the findings support the hypothesis that FGF-based ligand-mediated cytotoxicity can serve to target cytotoxic agents in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1677744184,"Oligosaccharide-lipid precursors and glycoprotein N-linked oligosaccharides isolated from the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, were compared with those from the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Bio-Gel P-4 chromatography of oligosaccharide intermediates showed that Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dol synthesis, transfer of glycan to protein, and glucose removal to yield Man9GlcNAc2 proceeded in S. pombe as in S. cerevisiae. Two series of oligosaccharides were released from S. pombe glycoproteins by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H; large mannan-like structures and smaller precursor or core-filling species. Unexpectedly, the smallest S. pombe N-linked glycan was Man9GlcNAc, confirmed by 500 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy to be the lipid-linked isomer. No endoplasmic reticulum Man9-alpha 1,2-mannosidase activity was detected in S. pombe, thus identifying Man9GlcNAc as the minimum precursor for oligosaccharide elongation in contrast to the Man8GlcNAc2 intermediate identified in S. cerevisiae (Byrd, J. C., Tarentino, A. L., Maley, F., Atkinson, P. H., and Trimble, R. B. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14657-14666). S. pombe Hex10GlcNAc was at least four isomers by high pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. Compositional analyses identified two of the major species as GalMan9GlcNAc and GlcMan9GlcNAc, the latter of which suggests that glycan trimming may be attenuated in the S. pombe endoplasmic reticulum. Hex13GlcNAc from S. pombe was homogeneous by mass spectrometry but yielded 12 species by high pH anion-exchange chromatography. Compositional analyses, alpha-galactosidase digestion, and lectin affinity chromatography on Griffonia simplicifolia lectin I-agarose indicated these to be a family of GalxMan13-xGlcNAc isomers (X = 1-4 residues). The absence of Man9GlcNAc2 to Man8GlcNAc2 trimming in S. pombe and elongation of the lipid precursor of Man9GlcNAc with both Man and Gal to form galactomannans provides a novel system for N-linked glycoprotein processing studies."
https://openalex.org/W1581400573,"Extensive structure activity analysis has allowed us to identify specific residues in the glucagon sequence that are responsible for either receptor recognition or signal transduction. For instance, we have demonstrated that aspartic acid 9 and histidine 1 are essential for activation, and that an ionic interaction between the negative carboxylate and the protonated imidazole may contribute to the activation reaction at the molecular level. In the absence of the carboxylic group at position 9, aspartic 21 or aspartic 15 might furnish distal electrostatic effects to maintain partial agonism. Further investigation established that each of the 4 serine residues in the hormone play distinct roles. Serine 8 provides an important determinant of binding. Whereas neither serines 2, 11, nor 16 are required for receptor recognition. We have shown that serine 16 is essential for signal transduction and thus have identified it to be the third residue in glucagon to participate in a putative catalytic triad together with aspartic 9 and histidine 1, in the transduction of the glucagon response. In this work, we utilized insights into the functional significance of particular residues in the peptide appropriated from our structure-function assignments, as the basis of a molecular approach for the design of active-site directed antagonists of glucagon. The importance as well as the accuracy of our findings are confirmed by the synthesis of a series of improved glucagon antagonists based on replacements at positions 1, 9, 11, 16, and 21. The inhibition index, (I/A)50, of our best antagonist des-His1-[Nle9-Ala11-Ala16]glucagon amide, has been improved 10-fold over the previous best glucagon inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W50186219,"Cl- and Ca2+ are obligatory cofactors in photosystem II (PS-II), the oxygen-evolving enzyme of plants. The electron transfer events in Cl(-)-depleted PS-II were investigated by using continuous wave (cw) and pulsed EPR, and the results were compared with those obtained in untreated and Ca(2+)-depleted PS-II. In Cl(-)-depleted PS-II, the S1 to S2 transition is not accompanied by the appearance of the S2 manganese signal in both cw and field-swept echo experiments. In the S3 state, the cw experiment reveals the presence of a radical signal, and the field-swept echo experiment reveals the presence of a manganese signal similar to that observed in the S2 state in Cl(-)-reconstituted PS-II. A relaxation enhancement study of the oxidized tyrosine D indicates that a relaxation enhancement occurs only in the S2 to S3 transition and not in the S1 to S2 transition. The results are interpreted by the following preferred model. In Cl(-)-depleted PS-II, the S1 to S2 transition corresponds to the oxidation of a component other than the manganese cluster, possibly an amino acid, and the S2 to S3 transition corresponds to the oxidation of the manganese complex. This oxidation sequence is the opposite of that observed in Ca(2+)-depleted PS-II and may be due to a modulation by chloride of the relative redox potentials of the manganese cluster and a nearby oxidizable amino acid. An alternative model involving manganese oxidation that is invisible in the S1 to S2 transition but that becomes visible on S3 formation cannot be ruled out, although it is considered less likely."
https://openalex.org/W72774733,"To understand the mechanism of gamma-monomethyl (meppp) cap formation, we attempted to identify and purify the U6 small nuclear RNA capping enzyme. Although more than one protein was cross-linked to U6, 7SK, B2, or plant U3 RNA, only one protein of approximately 130 kDa was common to all four meppp-capped RNAs; 5 S RNA, which is an uncapped RNA, was not cross-linked to this protein. In addition to specific cross-linking with meppp-capped RNAs, an approximately 130-kDa protein was also cross-linked to 3H-labeled AdoMet. We purified the capping enzyme from a HeLa cell S-100 extract by several successive chromatographic steps, and an approximately 130-kDa protein was purified along with the capping activity. The capping activity and the approximately 130-kDa protein also cosedimented on a glycerol gradient. The purified enzyme catalyzed meppp cap formation of U6, 7SK, B2, and plant U3 RNA, and this enzyme is probably responsible for the capping of multiple RNAs in vivo. The capping activity is distinct from U6 snRNA N6-adenosine methyltransferase, and this is the first methyltransferase to be purified that methylates gamma-phosphate residues in RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1603155543,"Substitution of the C-terminal leucine heptad repeat region of the normally tetrameric lactose repressor by the leucine heptad repeat dimerization domain of GCN4 protein resulted in cell extracts containing protein, designated R3, which behaved as a dimer based on gel retardation analysis of DNA binding (Alberti, S., Oehler, S., von Wilcken-Bergmann, B., and Muller-Hill, B. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 3227-3236). We have purified this R3 protein and characterized its properties in comparison with the wild-type repressor. R3 protein elutes from a molecular sieve with a Stokes radius characteristic of a dimer and a deduced molecular mass of 66 kDa. Unlike other dimeric repressors, produced by deletion or mutation in the leucine heptad repeat region, which display reduced apparent operator affinity, R3 binds to operator DNA sequences with wild-type equilibrium and kinetic properties. Although inducer affinity at neutral pH is similar for R3 and wild-type protein, at elevated pH the R3 protein undergoes a slightly smaller decrease in affinity and exhibits minimal cooperativity in sugar binding compared with the wild-type protein. Interestingly, in the presence of operator DNA, a state in which inducer binding to wild-type repressor is also of reduced affinity and slightly cooperative, R3 binding affinity is decreased to a greater extent, and the protein displays higher cooperativity than wild-type repressor. Consistent with inducer binding data in the presence of operator, the release of operator from R3 protein requires a higher sugar concentration than wild-type protein. These results are interpreted in the context of alterations involving the subunit interface which affect the allosteric behavior of the repressor protein."
https://openalex.org/W1526238231,"Abstract Interleukin-8 (IL-8) mediates the transendothelial migration and activation of neutrophils to the site of inflammation. Two human IL-8 receptor isotype (A and B) and one rabbit IL-8 receptor isotype (A) cDNAs have been previously cloned and characterized on the basis of their pharmacological profile. Human and rabbit IL-8 receptor subtype A binds IL-8 and structurally related peptide melanoma growth-stimulating activity (MGSA) and neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (NAP-2) according to the following affinity binding profile: IL-8 > MGSA > NAP-2, whereas the human IL-8 receptor subtype B profile is IL-8 = MGSA > NAP-2 (LaRosa, G., Thomas, K. M., Kaufmann, M., Mark, R., White, M., Taylor, L., Gray, G., Witt, D., and Navarro, J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 25402-25406). In this study, we isolated a cDNA clone (5B1a) from a rabbit neutrophil library encoding a G-protein-coupled receptor of the interleukin-8 receptor family. The 5B1a clone encodes a 358-amino acid protein exhibiting 80% amino acid identity to the human IL-8 receptor B, 74% to the rabbit IL-8 receptor A, and 73% to the human IL-8 receptor A. Tissue distribution by Northern blot analysis reveals that the 5B1a mRNA is expressed preferentially in neutrophils. In contrast to previously described IL-8 receptors, the 5B1a receptor exhibited specific 125I-IL-8 binding with a novel affinity binding profile of IL-8 > NAP-2 > MGSA. The corresponding apparent Ki values for IL-8, NAP-2, and MGSA were 4, 120, and 320 nM, respectively. IL-8 induced intracellular calcium mobilization and desensitization in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with 5B1a, indicating that this cDNA encodes a functional IL-8 receptor. Sequence analysis of the 5B1a protein with other IL-8 receptor subtypes within the framework of their pharmacological profile reveals putative structural motifs that may correspond to the ligand binding site of the IL-8 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1560501783,"Effects of the cytostatic drug adriamycin on inositol polyphosphate metabolism were analyzed in a human T-cell line (Jurkat) using a recently developed anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography/post-column complexometric dye system. Treatment of intact T-cells with adriamycin prior to stimulation with an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody induced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in the intracellular level of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (complete inhibition after 2 h at 10 microM adriamycin) and an increase in the level of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate without significantly changing the levels of other inositol phosphates. A marked inhibition of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase activity and a slight activation of the inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate 5-phosphatase activity were observed in cytosolic extracts in the presence of adriamycin, providing an explanation for the drug-induced metabolic effect. Adriamycin thus seems to be an extremely valuable tool for further dissecting inositol polyphosphate metabolism, as well as signaling pathways. Along these lines, we observed that adriamycin did not change the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration of Jurkat T-lymphocytes and, in particular, did not modulate Ca2+ influx upon T-cell receptor stimulation. We conclude that (i) inositol phosphate signaling pathways constitute an as yet undescribed target for the action of adriamycin and that (ii) an increase of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate is not necessary for sustained Ca(2+)-entry in stimulated T-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1486791172,"The diversity of the gamma subunits in bovine brain G protein preparations was investigated using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Analysis of these G protein mixtures revealed at least four gamma subunit masses by the following four criteria. 1) The measured masses were in the same mass range as the predicted molecular weights of gamma isoforms. 2) The masses were reproducible between the same or different preparations of G proteins. 3) The masses were independent of the matrix used for MALDI analysis. 4) The masses comigrated with the gamma subunit, as part of the heterotrimer, the beta gamma dimer, or the separated gamma subunit. These measured masses were compared with those calculated from cDNA sequences of known bovine brain gamma isoforms with the addition of plausible post-translational modifications. The mass of each spectral peak was consistent with the calculated mass for only one of four known bovine brain gamma subunit isoforms, but the data suggest modifications of the gamma subunits in addition to those already known or suspected at their carboxyl termini. Besides these four major masses, several additional, less resolved spectral peaks were observed whose measured masses did not correlate with any known gamma subunit or plausible modification. MALDI mass spectrometry promises to be a powerful technique for the analysis of the diversity of the gamma subunit in G proteins and for the characterization of their post-translational modifications."
https://openalex.org/W44836647,"Tissue-specific isoforms of the mitochondrial ATP synthase gamma-subunit are generated by alternative splicing, and the heart/skeletal muscle-specific transcript lacks exon 9 in a cassette fashion (Matsuda, C., Endo, H., Hirata, H., Morosawa, H., Nakanishi, M., and Kagawa, Y. (1993) FEBS Lett. 325, 281-284; and Matsuda, C., Endo, H., Ohta, S., and Kagawa, Y. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 24950-24958). Here, we show that the endogenous heart-type mRNA is cell-specifically induced by the extracellular pH value in the HT1080 (human fibrosarcoma) and KYM-1 (human rhabdomyosarcoma) cell lines. In these cells, a low extracellular pH value induced exclusion of exon 9, and this induction was inhibited by cycloheximide treatment. In contrast, a high extracellular pH value resulted in mRNA transcription of the liver type, including exon 9, and did not require de novo protein synthesis. These results suggest that alternative splicing in the gamma-subunit pre-mRNA is regulated by on-off switching of protein synthesis of a trans-acting factor involved in this exon-excluding step. The signal of low pH value was blocked by the protein kinase inhibitor H-7 or Calphostin C (protein kinase C inhibitor), indicating the involvement of protein kinase C in the alternative splicing. This is a good model system for studies on the induction mechanism of alternative splicing in cultured mammalian cells, in which intracellular factors play a pivotal role for the exon-excluding step in the tissue-specific alternative splicing mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1521531541,"The Escherichia coli galactose repressor protein (GalR) inhibits transcription of the gal operon upon binding to two operator sites (1-7). This DNA binding activity is inhibited when D-galactose or D-fucose binds to GalR (8-14). Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize the single tryptophan of GalR and to investigate the interaction between galactose and GalR. Fluorescence quenching experiments place both tryptophan residues of the GalR dimer in similar, solvent-exposed locations. Galactose is shown to enhance the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of GalR, the source of which is not explained by a change in decay times, but is due to an increase in the pre-exponential factor of the longest of the three fluorescence decay times. It is shown that the beta-anomer of D-galactose is the likely form that binds to GalR. An increase in pH from 6.3 to 9.5 causes the equilibrium association constant (K alpha) describing the galactose-GalR interaction to decrease 10-fold. The interaction is cooperative below pH 9.5. Over the pH range of 6.3 to 9.5, the tryptophan solvent exposure of GalR increases. Galactose binding also induces an increase in exposure. These results, and others presented in this paper, show that both pH and galactose cause global alterations in the structure of GalR."
https://openalex.org/W148231751,"Sulfhydryl substitution mutants of rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase; EC 2.8.1.1) were used to determine whether the 4 cysteine residues in the native structure could cooperate in reactions. The sulfhydryl reactivity of persulfide-containing (ES) rhodanese was not significantly changed when cysteine residues at positions 63, 254, and 263 were replaced by serine, either individually or in combination. However, the sulfhydryl reactivity of persulfide-free (E) rhodanese was enhanced when Cys-254 was mutated. One sulfhydryl group, presumably the active site Cys-247, reacted rapidly in the E forms of these proteins with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) or 4,4'-dipyridyl disulfide (4-PDS). After reaction with DTNB or 4-PDS, proteins with Cys-254 retained > 95% of their original activities as compared with Ser-254-containing proteins, which retained < 6% of their activities. Cyanide treatment could release thionitrobenzoate from rhodanese-thionitrobenzoate complexes with an approximate 1:1 stoichiometry. After this treatment, only the wild-type and C263S enzymes were fully active. Cyanide-treated rhodanese-thionitrobenzoate complexes of the C254S and C254S/C263S mutants could be fully reactivated using an exogenously added thiol, beta-mercaptoethanol. These results are consistent with the formation of a Cys-247-thiocyano derivative that is inactive but capable of being reactivated by intramolecular transfer of cyanide to Cys-254. In the absence of Cys-254, beta-mercaptoethanol can serve as the transferring sulfhydryl group."
https://openalex.org/W1529692087,"We have combined site-directed mutagenesis with the technique of reversible unfolding and subunit dissociation to construct heterodimeric thymidylate synthases that lack the C-terminal valine from only one subunit of the dimer. Removal of this residue either from both subunits of the dimer by mutagenesis (V316Am mutation) or from only one subunit by treatment with carboxypeptidase has been reported to result in an inactive enzyme (Carreras, C. W., Climie, S. C., and Santi, D. V. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 6038-6044; Aull, J.L., Loeble, R.B., and Dunlap. R.B. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 1167-1172). Arg-178 is an essential active site residue of thymidylate synthase that is donated from the opposing subunit of the dimer. The R178F-V316Am heterodimer was formed by the unfolding and refolding of a mixture of inactive R178F and V316Am mutants. This enzyme has one intact active site and was found to have half of the activity and the same Km values as wild-type thymidylate synthase that was unfolded and refolded as a control. We have also formed the V316Am-WT heterodimer and report that this heterodimeric enzyme is also active, has a kcat value that is approximately half of that of the wild-type thymidylate synthase dimer, and binds substrate and cofactor with Km values similar to those of the wild-type enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1581155576,"We have used block-substitution mutagenesis and in vitro transcription assays to identify cis-acting DNA sequence elements important for initiation and 3'-end formation of a U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) in the parasitic nematode Ascaris lumbricoides. Efficient initiation of synthesis by RNA polymerase II requires a compact element centered approximately 50 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site. Surprisingly, 3'-end formation of U1 snRNAs synthesized in vitro is solely dependent upon elements within the U1 coding sequence. In all other systems studied thus far, 3'-end formation of U snRNAs requires signals present in the 3'-flanking region. We also show that sequence elements that direct 3'-end formation of the A. lumbricoides trans-spliced leader RNA function when RNA synthesis is initiated from the U1 promoter. These results indicate that 3'-end formation of U snRNAs in nematodes is mechanistically distinct from the analogous process in higher eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2165924676,"A site-specific mutant of horse heart myoglobin has been prepared in which the distal heme pocket residue, His64, is replaced by tyrosine. The structure of this myoglobin variant has been determined to 2.0-A resolution using x-ray diffraction techniques and refined to a final crystallographic R-factor of 16.9%. The polypeptide backbone conformation of the His64-->Tyr variant of myoglobin is very similar to that of the wild-type protein. However, in the variant the water normally found coordinated to the heme iron atom and hydrogen-bonded to His64 has been displaced by the hydroxyl oxygen of the Tyr64 side chain. The tyrosine oxygen atom is directly coordinated to the heme iron atom with a bond length of 2.18 A. Distortion of heme planarity and changes in the packing of the Leu29 and Leu104 side chains are related to this mutation. The ligand environment of the ferric iron has been studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy using crystalline material and protein in solution. The protein in solution exhibits a rhombically split ferric high spin EPR spectrum with g values of 6.64, 5.34, and 1.98. The EPR spectrum of the crystalline sample consists of two different ferric high spin signals. The main signal is similar to the signal observed in solution and is assigned to His93-Fe(III)-Tyr64 coordination. The relatively high rhombicity of this signal can be explained as arising from distortions of the heme plane seen in the crystal structure. The second, more axial high spin signal found in the crystalline state can be tentatively assigned to another form of iron ligation with a different iron-tyrosine bond length and a less distorted heme plane."
https://openalex.org/W1556740327,"The chasm that C. P. Snow noted between the two cultures of science and the humanities may be part of an explanation for the success of the animal rights movement. Many philosophers, who represent the culture of the humanities, take an animal liberation position in the ethical debate about the use of animals in research. One who does not is Peter Carruthers. He presents a valuable critique of two important animal liberation ethicists, Tom Regan and Peter Singer, analyzing their thinking on the origins of ethical ideas and the source of ethical motivation. He identifies problems in their theories leading to conclusions that defy common sense about the value of human life. As an alternative, Carruthers introduces John Rawls' theory of contractualism. This theory provides a framework within which medical researchers and the public at large can defend the humane use of animals in research. His work promises to help bridge the gap between scientists and representatives of the humanities."
