https://openalex.org/W1970516100,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) is known to suppress NF-κB activity, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here we show that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) physically interacts with IκB kinase β (IKKβ) to block NF-κB activation. 1,25(OH)2D3 rapidly attenuates TNFα-induced p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB activity in a VDR-dependent manner. VDR overexpression inhibits IKKβ-induced NF-κB activity. GST pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that VDR physically interacts with IKKβ and that this interaction is enhanced by 1,25(OH)2D3. Protein mapping reveals that VDR-IKKβ interaction occurs between the C-terminal portions of the VDR and IKKβ proteins. Reconstitution of VDR(-/-) cells with the VDR C terminus restores the ability to block TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and IL-6 up-regulation. VDR-IKKβ interaction disrupts the formation of the IKK complex and, thus, abrogates IKKβ phosphorylation at Ser-177 and abolishes IKK activity to phosphorylate IκBα. Consequently, stabilization of IκBα arrests p65/p50 nuclear translocation. Together, these data define a novel mechanism whereby 1,25(OH)2D3-VDR inhibits NF-κB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2060198946,"Patients with chronic kidney disease have abnormal energy expenditure and metabolism. The mechanisms underlying altered energy expenditure in uremia are unknown and remain to be elucidated. Irisin is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α–dependent myokine, and it increases energy expenditure in the absence of changes in food intake or activity. We hypothesize that chronic kidney disease patients have altered irisin levels. We measured resting irisin levels in 38 patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease and in 19 age- and sex-matched normal subjects. Plasma irisin levels were significantly decreased in chronic kidney disease patients (58.59%; 95% CI 47.9%–69.2%, p<0.0001). The decrease in irisin levels was inversely correlated with the levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Further association analysis revealed that irisin level is independently associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Our results suggest that chronic kidney disease patients have lower than normal irisin levels at rest. Furthermore, irisin may play a major role in affecting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and abnormal energy expenditure in chronic kidney disease patients."
https://openalex.org/W2064245163,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), an inherited peroxisomal disorder, is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene encoding the peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCD1 (adrenoleukodystrophy protein, ALDP). Biochemically, X-ALD is characterized by an accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids and partially impaired peroxisomal β-oxidation. In this study, we used primary human fibroblasts from X-ALD and Zellweger syndrome patients to investigate the peroxisomal β-oxidation defect. Our results show that the degradation of C26:0-CoA esters is as severely impaired as degradation of unesterified very long-chain fatty acids in X-ALD and is abolished in Zellweger syndrome. Interestingly, the β-oxidation rates for both C26:0-CoA and C22:0-CoA were similarly affected, although C22:0 does not accumulate in patient fibroblasts. Furthermore, we show that the β-oxidation defect in X-ALD is directly caused by ABCD1 dysfunction as blocking ABCD1 function with a specific antibody reduced β-oxidation to levels observed in X-ALD fibroblasts. By quantification of mRNA and protein levels of the peroxisomal ABC transporters and by blocking with specific antibodies, we found that residual β-oxidation activity toward C26:0-CoA in X-ALD fibroblasts is mediated by ABCD3, although the efficacy of ABCD3 appeared to be much lower than that of ABCD1. Finally, using isolated peroxisomes, we show that β-oxidation of C26:0-CoA is independent of additional CoA but requires a cytosolic factor of >10-kDa molecular mass that is resistant to N-ethylmaleimide and heat inactivation. In conclusion, our findings in human cells suggest that, in contrast to yeast cells, very long-chain acyl-CoA esters are transported into peroxisomes by ABCD1 independently of additional synthetase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2094757523,"Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. The prognosis remains dismal with little advance in treatment. Metformin is a drug widely used for the treatment of type II diabetes. Recent epidemiologic data revealed that oral administration of metformin is associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, suggesting its potential as a novel drug for this disease. Many studies have demonstrated the in vitro anticancer action of metformin, but the typically used concentrations were much higher than the in vivo plasma and tissue concentrations achieved with recommended therapeutic doses of metformin, and low concentrations of metformin had little effect on the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. We examined the effect of low concentrations of metformin on different subpopulations of pancreatic cancer cells and found that these selectively inhibited the proliferation of CD133⁺ but not CD24⁺CD44⁺ESA⁺ cells. We also examined the effect of low concentrations of metformin on cell invasion and in vivo tumor formation, demonstrating in vitro and in vivo anticancer action. Metformin was associated with a reduction of phospho-Erk and phospho-mTOR independent of Akt and AMPK phosphorylation. CD133⁺ pancreatic cancer cells are considered to be cancer stem cells that contribute to recurrence, metastasis and resistance to adjuvant therapies in pancreatic cancer. Our results provide a basis for combination of metformin with current therapies to improve the prognosis of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2044948834,"Artificial lighting is strongly associated with urbanisation and is increasing in its extent, brightness and spectral range. Changes in urban lighting have both positive and negative effects on city performance, yet little is known about how its character and magnitude vary across the urban landscape. A major barrier to related research, planning and governance has been the lack of lighting data at the city extent, particularly at a fine spatial resolution. Our aims were therefore to capture such data using aerial night photography and to undertake a case study of urban lighting. We present the finest scale multi-spectral lighting dataset available for an entire city and explore how lighting metrics vary with built density and land-use. We found positive relationships between artificial lighting indicators and built density at coarse spatial scales, whilst at a local level lighting varied with land-use. Manufacturing and housing are the primary land-use zones responsible for the city’s brightly lit areas, yet manufacturing sites are relatively rare within the city. Our data suggests that efforts to address light pollution should broaden their focus from residential street lighting to include security lighting within manufacturing areas."
https://openalex.org/W2074300020,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a pluripotent lipophilic mediator working as a ligand for G-protein coupled S1P receptors (S1PR), which is currently highlighted as a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases including relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Sphingosine related compounds, FTY720 and KRP203 known as S1PR modulators, are phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) to yield the active metabolites FTY720-P and KRP203-P, which work as functional antagonists for S1PRs. Here we report that FTY720 and KRP203 decreased production of Amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), a pathogenic proteins causative for Alzheimer disease (AD), in cultured neuronal cells. Pharmacological analyses suggested that the mechanism of FTY720-mediated Aβ decrease in cells was independent of known downstream signaling pathways of S1PRs. Unexpectedly, 6-days treatment of APP transgenic mice with FTY720 resulted in a decrease in Aβ40, but an increase in Aβ42 levels in brains. These results suggest that S1PR modulators are novel type of regulators for Aβ metabolisms that are active in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2094746012,"Preeclampsia (PE) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) contribute significantly to fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Although the causes of PE and FGR are not fully understood, both conditions are known to be associated with impaired uterine artery blood flow. Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in a number of plants, has been shown to induce relaxation of uterine arteries in vitro as well as improve many pathological conditions associated with PE and FGR. We hypothesized that treatment of endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout mice (eNOS−/−) and catechol-O-methyltransferase knockout mice (COMT−/−) with resveratrol during pregnancy would improve uterine artery blood flow and therefore ameliorate the PE-like phenotype and FGR in these murine models. Pregnant C57BL/6J, eNOS−/− and COMT−/− mice received either resveratrol supplemented diet (4 g/kg diet) or control diet between gestational day (GD) 0.5 and GD 18.5. Resveratrol supplementation significantly increased uterine artery blood flow velocity and fetal weight in COMT−/− but not in eNOS−/− mice. There were no effects of resveratrol on litter size and placental weight among the groups. In conclusion, resveratrol increased uterine artery blood flow velocity and fetal weight in COMT−/− mice, suggesting potential as a therapeutic strategy for PE and FGR."
https://openalex.org/W2042427380,"Ongoing debate about whether food webs are primarily regulated by predators or by primary plant productivity, cast as top-down and bottom-up effects, respectively, may becoming superfluous. Given that most of the world's ecosystems are human dominated we broadened this dichotomy by considering human effects in a terrestrial food-web. We studied a multiple human-use landscape in southwest Alberta, Canada, as opposed to protected areas where previous terrestrial food-web studies have been conducted. We used structural equation models (SEMs) to assess the strength and direction of relationships between the density and distribution of: (1) humans, measured using a density index; (2) wolves (Canis lupus), elk (Cervus elapahus) and domestic cattle (Bos taurus), measured using resource selection functions, and; (3) forage quality, quantity and utilization (measured at vegetation sampling plots). Relationships were evaluated by taking advantage of temporal and spatial variation in human density, including day versus night, and two landscapes with the highest and lowest human density in the study area. Here we show that forage-mediated effects of humans had primacy over predator-mediated effects in the food web. In our parsimonious SEM, occurrence of humans was most correlated with occurrence of forage (β = 0.637, p<0.0001). Elk and cattle distribution were correlated with forage (elk day: β = 0.400, p<0.0001; elk night: β = 0.369, p<0.0001; cattle day: β = 0.403, p<0.0001; cattle, night: β = 0.436, p<0.0001), and the distribution of elk or cattle and wolves were positively correlated during daytime (elk: β = 0.293, p <0.0001, cattle: β = 0.303, p<0.0001) and nighttime (elk: β = 0.460, p<0.0001, cattle: β = 0.482, p<0.0001). Our results contrast with research conducted in protected areas that suggested human effects in the food web are primarily predator-mediated. Instead, human influence on vegetation may strengthen bottom-up predominance and weaken top-down trophic cascades in ecosystems. We suggest that human influences on ecosystems may usurp top-down and bottom-up effects."
https://openalex.org/W2050580400,"The circulation of West Nile virus and Usutu virus was detected in the Emilia-Romagna region in 2008 and 2009. To evaluate the extent of circulation of both viruses, environmental surveillance, based on bird and mosquito testing, was conducted in 2008 and gradually improved over the years.In February-March 2009-2011, 5,993 hibernating mosquitoes were manually sampled, out of which 80.1% were Culex pipiens; none tested positive for the viruses. From 2008 to 2011, 946,213 mosquitoes, sampled between May and October, were tested; 86.5% were Cx. pipiens. West Nile virus was detected in 32 Cx. pipiens pools, and Usutu virus was detected in 229 mosquito pools (217 Cx. pipiens, 10 Aedes albopictus, one Anopheles maculipennis s.l., and one Aedes caspius). From 2009 to 2011, of 4,546 birds collected, 42 tested positive for West Nile virus and 48 for Usutu virus. West Nile virus and Usutu virus showed different patterns of activity during the 2008-2011 surveillance period. West Nile virus was detected in 2008, 2009, and 2010, but not in 2011. Usutu virus, however, was continuously active throughout 2009, 2010, and 2011.The data strongly suggest that both viruses overwinter in the surveyed area rather than being continually reintroduced every season. The lack of hibernating mosquitoes testing positive for the viruses and the presence of positive birds sampled early in the season support the hypothesis that the viruses overwinter in birds rather than in mosquitoes. Herd immunity in key bird species could explain the decline of West Nile virus observed in 2011, while the persistence of Usutu virus may be explained by not yet identified reservoirs. Reported results are comparable with a peri-Mediterranean circulation of the West Nile virus lineage 1 related strain, which became undetectable in the environment after two to three years of obvious circulation."
https://openalex.org/W1968016411,"Several live attenuated rotavirus (RV) vaccines have been licensed, but the mechanisms of protective immunity are still poorly understood. The most frequent human B cell response is directed to the internal protein VP6 on the surface of double-layered particles, which is normally exposed only in the intracellular environment. Here, we show that the canonical VP6 antibodies secreted by humans bind to such particles and inhibit viral transcription. Polymeric IgA RV antibodies mediated an inhibitory effect against virus replication inside cells during IgA transcytosis. We defined the recognition site on VP6 as a quaternary epitope containing a high density of charged residues. RV human mAbs appear to bind to a negatively-charged patch on the surface of the Type I channel in the transcriptionally active particle, and they sterically block the channel. This unique mucosal mechanism of viral neutralization, which is not apparent from conventional immunoassays, may contribute significantly to human immunity to RV."
https://openalex.org/W2040788846,"The RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 is the master regulator of the tumor suppressor p53. It targets p53 for proteasomal degradation, restraining the potent activity of p53 and enabling cell survival and proliferation. Like most E3 ligases, Mdm2 can also ubiquitinate itself. How Mdm2 auto-ubiquitination may influence its substrate ubiquitin ligase activity is undefined. Here we show that auto-ubiquitination of Mdm2 is an activating event. Mdm2 that has been conjugated to polyubiquitin chains, but not to single ubiquitins, exhibits substantially enhanced activity to polyubiquitinate p53. Mechanistically, auto-ubiquitination of Mdm2 facilitates the recruitment of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. This occurs through noncovalent interactions between the ubiquitin chains on Mdm2 and the ubiquitin binding domain on E2s. Mutations that diminish the noncovalent interactions render auto-ubiquitination unable to stimulate Mdm2 substrate E3 activity.

Significance: Auto-ubiquitination may be a general mechanism for the activation of ubiquitin ligases. Covalent conjugation to ubiquitin is a major post-translational modification that regulates protein stability, function, and localization (1Pickart C.M. Back to the future with ubiquitin.Cell. 2004; 116: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination takes place due to sequential actions of three enzymes: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 2The abbreviations used are:E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase; CRL, Cullin-RING ligase; Mdm2, mouse double minute 2; RING, really interesting new gene; Ub, ubiquitin; UBD, ubiquitin binding domain. a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). The specificity and efficiency of ubiquitination are largely determined by the E3, which binds to both an E2 thioesterified with ubiquitin (E2∼Ub) and a substrate protein, and stimulates the transfer of ubiquitin from E2∼Ub to the substrate. The vast majority of the hundreds of known ubiquitin E3s contain a RING (really interesting new gene) domain (1Pickart C.M. Back to the future with ubiquitin.Cell. 2004; 116: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 2Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Some RING proteins contain only the RING domain and function in multisubunit E3 complexes (e.g. Cullin-RING ligases or CRLs) (3Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Function and regulation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar), but most RING proteins are relatively large proteins with multiple domains and can function as single-molecule E3s. A protein can be conjugated at one or multiple sites with a single ubiquitin or a polyubiquitin chain (1Pickart C.M. Back to the future with ubiquitin.Cell. 2004; 116: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 2Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Formation of polyubiquitin chains is critical for protein degradation and various nondegradative processes including signal transduction. However, the mechanism for the processive assembly of ubiquitin chains remains poorly understood. For RING E3s, a major rate-limiting step for the formation of a polyubiquitin chain is the recruitment of E2∼Ub to the E3 (2Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar, 4Ye Y. Rape M. Building ubiquitin chains: E2 enzymes at work.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Because an E2 interacts with both E1 and the E3 RING domain through overlapping regions (5Eletr Z.M. Huang D.T. Duda D.M. Schulman B.A. Kuhlman B. E2 conjugating enzymes must disengage from their E1 enzymes before E3-dependent ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like transfer.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 933-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), it needs to dissociate from the RING domain to be re-thioesterified with ubiquitin. Previous studies have shown that the cullin protein Cul1-based CRLs circumvent this rate-limiting step in part through rapid association and disassociation between an E2 and the E3 RING domain. This dynamic interaction is facilitated by a separate E2 binding site on the Cul1 subunit (6Kleiger G. Saha A. Lewis S. Kuhlman B. Deshaies R.J. Rapid E2-E3 assembly and disassembly enable processive ubiquitylation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase substrates.Cell. 2009; 139: 957-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Yet, the mechanism by which relatively large RING E3s achieve processive ubiquitination is not known. A notable trait of RING-containing E3s is their auto-ubiquitination (7Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. RING fingers mediate ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)-dependent ubiquitination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Despite being commonly regarded as a mechanism of autocatalytic degradation, the function of E3 automodification is not well defined. The multidomain RING-containing protein Mdm2 is the principal ubiquitin ligase of the pre-eminent tumor suppressor p53 (8Vousden K.H. Prives C.

Mdm2 association with p53 targets its ubiquitination.Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). p53 becomes activated in response to cellular stresses such as DNA damage, nutrient deprivation, and oncogene activation. The activation of p53 leads to potent anti-proliferative outcomes ranging from cell cycle arrest to senescence and apoptosis, making the control of p53 levels a central issue in mammalian cells (8Vousden K.H. Prives C. Blinded by the light: the growing complexity of p53.Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar). In unstressed cells, p53 is a short lived protein largely due to Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Mdm2 also undergoes auto-ubiquitination. Although this was previously thought to cause Mdm2 to be degraded, subsequent studies have shown that auto-ubiquitination of Mdm2 is not responsible for Mdm2 degradation in vivo (12Itahana K. Mao H. Jin A. Itahana Y. Clegg H.V. Lindström M.S. Bhat K.P. Godfrey V.L. Evan G.I. Zhang Y. Targeted inactivation of Mdm2 RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in the mouse reveals mechanistic insights into p53 regulation.Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 355-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Here we seek to address the function of Mdm2 auto-ubiquitination. We show that auto-ubiquitination of Mdm2 can enhance its substrate ubiquitination activity. We also find that auto-ubiquitination of Mdm2 leads to strong recruitment of E2-conjugating enzymes, overcoming the rate-limiting step of E2 recruitment and increasing the processivity of ubiquitination. Plasmids for expressing p53 and Mdm2 in mammalian cells are in pRK5 vector with N-terminal FLAG, HA, or GST tags as described previously (13Tang J. Qu L.K. Zhang J. Wang W. Michaelson J.S.

The following reagents were purchased from Boston Biochem: ubiquitin E1 (E-305), UbcH5a (E2–616), Mg2+-ATP (B-20), ubiquitin (U-100H), methylated ubiquitin (U-501), Lys48-only ubiquitin (UM-K480), and I44A ubiquitin (UM-I44A). The antibodies for the following proteins were purchased from the indicated sources: p53 (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); Mdm2 (Ab-1, Calbiochem); ubiquitin (P4D1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); polyubiquitinated conjugates (FK1 clone, Enzo Life Sciences); UbcH5 (A-615, Boston Biochem); UbcH5c (ab58251, Abcam); and MdmX (A300-287A, Bethyl Scientific). For purifying Mdm2 and p53, the corresponding expression plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells. Cells expressing Mdm2 were further treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 4 h. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold 1× PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 100 mm NaF, and 1× Complete protease mixture). GST-Mdm2 was precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare, 17-0756-01), and HA-Mdm2 with anti-HA affinity beads (Roche Applied Science). Bead-bound Mdm2 was sequentially washed twice with lysis buffer, once with lysis buffer plus 0.5 m KCl, once with lysis buffer plus 1 m KCl, and once with ubiquitination reaction buffer. Bead-bound Mdm2 was resuspended in ubiquitination reaction buffer and used for subsequent in vitro reactions. FLAG-tagged p53 was purified with M2 beads (Sigma) as described previously (13Tang J.

To purify the Mdm2-MdmX complex, GST-Mdm2 and FLAG-MdmX were co-expressed in HEK293T cells. Cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 4 h. Lysates were incubated with M2 beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and twice with elution buffer. Bound MdmX was eluted with 3× FLAG peptide for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Eluate was incubated with glutathione beads in lysis buffer overnight. Bead-bound Mdm2-MdmX complexes were washed as described for the purification of Mdm2 proteins. To generate recombinant WT and S22R UbcH5c proteins, BL21 cells containing either WT UbcH5c pET28a or S22R UbcH5c pET28a were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were resuspended in sonication buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) and lysed by sonication. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Supernatant was fractionated by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column driven by an AKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare). Fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected. Purified proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained by Coomassie, and quantified by densitometry against a BSA standard curve or by Western blotting against known protein standards. Fractions containing only UbcH5c were pooled and used for ubiquitination/binding reaction. Proteins in sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE for Mdm2 and p53, 15% SDS-PAGE for E2, and 8–15% gradient for simultaneously detecting GST and GST-Mdm2. Stacking gels were retained for all ubiquitination reactions. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. For ubiquitin blotting, membranes were boiled in water for 2 min using a microwave prior to blocking. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-T and probed with the indicated antibodies. Auto-ubiquitination reactions consisted of 3–5 ng of bead-bound Mdm2, 100 nm E1, 500 nm UbcH5a, 2 mm Mg2+-ATP, 2 mm DTT, and 2–5 μg of wild-type or mutant ubiquitin in final volume of 20 μl of ubiquitination reaction buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6). In control reactions, either ubiquitin (see Fig. 2B) or Mg2+-ATP (in the rest of figures) was omitted. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C on a microtube orbital shaker (Labnet, Shaker20) at 1400 rpm and were either stopped by addition of sample buffer or washed three times with ubiquitination reaction buffer and aliquotted in separate tubes for p53 ubiquitination. p53 ubiquitination was performed at 22 °C with 10 ng of FLAG-p53 for 5 min or the indicated times. Mdm2 and p53 ubiquitination was detected by Western blotting using anti-Mdm2 and anti-p53 antibody, respectively. To detect p53 polyubiquitination, FLAG-p53 (30 ng) was ubiquitinated by Mdm2 as described above. Reaction mixtures were denatured by adding SDS to 1% final concentration and boiling for 5 min, and diluted to reduce the SDS concentration to 0.1%. FLAG-p53 was pulled down with anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-polyubiquitin or anti-p53 antibodies. Thioesterification of E2 was performed using 150 nm E1, 600 ng of WT or S22R E2, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm Mg2+-ATP, and 2 μg of ubiquitin in a final volume of 20 μl of ubiquitination reaction buffer. Reactions were incubated at 22 °C for indicated times and analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For p53 and Mdm2 binding, GST-Mdm2 (unmodified or auto-ubiquitinated) immobilized on glutathione beads was first blocked with 3% BSA for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were incubated with 30 ng of p53 in lysis buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. For binding between Mdm2 and E2, ∼100 ng of immobilized GST or GST-Mdm2 (unmodified or auto-ubiquitinated) was washed with 50 mm HEPES and incubated with 1 μg of UbcH5c in a 50-μl final volume of lysis buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. Samples were treated with 15 mm dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate], a thiol-cleavable cross-linker (Thermo Scientific), at 22 °C for 2 min. Cross-linking was quenched with 50 mm (final concentration) Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 15 min. After extensive washing, the bead-bound proteins were boiled in sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol to reverse the cross-linking and analyzed by Western blotting. To examine how Mdm2 auto-ubiquitination may affect its ability to covalently modify p53, we used an in vitro system where auto-ubiquitination could be readily separated from the subsequent p53 ubiquitination. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged Mdm2 was immobilized on beads and incubated with E1, E2, and ubiquitin, in the presence or absence of ATP to permit or prevent Mdm2 auto-ubiquitination (Fig. 1A and 1B, left). Afterward, the ubiquitination reaction components were washed away, and the unmodified and automodified Mdm2 was used to conjugate p53 with ubiquitin in the presence of fresh reaction components. Of note, compared with the unmodified Mdm2, automodified Mdm2 exhibited a noticeably stronger ability to ubiquitinate p53 (Fig. 1B, right). To exclude any GST tag-specific effects, we performed a similar experiment using hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Mdm2. Automodified HA-Mdm2 also showed a strongly enhanced ability to ubiquitinate p53 (Fig. 1C). In vivo Mdm2 is present predominantly as a heterodimer with MdmX, which possesses minimal E3 activity of its own, but stimulates the E3 activity of Mdm2 (16Kawai H. Lopez-Pajares V. Kim M.M.

To generate the Mdm2-MdmX complex, we co-expressed GST-tagged Mdm2 and FLAG-tagged MdmX in cells and performed sequential pulldowns with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated beads and glutathione beads. Upon auto-ubiquitination, the purified Mdm2-MdmX complex showed markedly enhanced E3 activity toward p53 (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that auto-ubiquitination enhances the E3 activity of both Mdm2 and the Mdm2-MdmX complex. A polyubiquitin chain linked through the Lys48 residue on ubiquitin is the canonical signal for proteasomal degradation (1Pickart C.M. Back to the future with ubiquitin.Cell. 2004; 116: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). We examined whether p53 polyubiquitination was enhanced by Mdm2 auto-ubiquitination. When automodified Mdm2 was used, polyubiquitinated p53 species, which were indicated by their reactivity to a polyubiquitin-specific antibody as well as by their extremely high molecular masses, appeared rapidly (within 2 min). In contrast, when unmodified Mdm2 was used, polyubiquitinated p53 species appeared relatively slowly (in ∼20 min) (Fig. 2A). Automodified Mdm2 also exhibited an enhanced ability to conjugate p53 with Lys48-only ubiquitin, in which all Lys residues except for Lys48 were mutated to Arg residues (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–7). These results suggest that auto-ubiquitination of Mdm2 enhances its ability to conjugate p53 with Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains. To examine whether the extent of Mdm2 auto-ubiquitination influences its substrate E3 activity, we performed a time course experiment for Mdm2 auto-ubiquitination. The ability of GST-Mdm2 to ubiquitinate p53 initially increased in relation to more auto-ubiquitination, but later declined with higher levels of auto-ubiquitination (Fig. 3A). A similar result was observed using HA-Mdm2 (Fig. 3B). However, regardless of the extent of auto-ubiquitination, automodified Mdm2 was consistently more active than unmodified Mdm2 at ubiquitinating p53. To determine whether the increase in Mdm2 substrate E3 activity is due to polyubiquitination, we used methylated ubiquitin, which permits only mono-ubiquitination at one or multiple sites (19Hershko A. Ganoth D. Pehrson J. Palazzo R.E. Cohen L.H. Methylated ubiquitin inhibits cyclin degradation in clam embryo extracts.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16376-16379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate E3 activity of methyl-ubiquitinated Mdm2 was comparable with that of unmodified Mdm2 (Fig. 3C), indicating that mono-ubiquitination did not enhance Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. Next we investigated the mechanisms by which auto-ubiquitination of Mdm2 stimulates the substrate E3 activity of Mdm2. A possible explanation is that auto-ubiquitination might enhance the ability of Mdm2 to interact with p53. However, an in vitro pulldown assay showed that unmodified and automodified Mdm2 were comparable in their binding to p53 (Fig. 4A). Additionally, we considered the possibility that Mdm2 may transfer ubiquitin chains assembled on itself to p53. A previous study showed that the RING domain ubiquitin ligase gp78, which is involved in degradation of misfolded endoplasmic reticulum proteins, could transfer to the substrate protein a polyubiquitin chain that is attached via a thioester bond to the active site Cys residue of the E2 Ube2g2 (20Li W. Tu D. Brunger A.T. Ye Y. A ubiquitin ligase transfers preformed polyubiquitin chains from a conjugating enzyme to a substrate.Nature. 2007; 446: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). For a polyubiquitin chain attached via an isopeptide bond to a Lys residue on an E3, such a transfer mechanism has not been reported. To distinguish between de novo chain synthesis and ubiquitin transfer, we incubated auto-ubiquitinated GST-Mdm2 with p53 and ubiquitination components but omitted ubiquitin from the reaction. p53 was ubiquitinated in the absence of fresh ubiquitin, but the amount of ubiquitination was very small and accounted for only a minute fraction of total p53 ubiquitination mediated by automodified Mdm2 (Fig. 4B, lanes 2–4 versus lanes 5–7). This result suggests that auto-ubiquitin transfer is unlikely to be the mechanism by which auto-ubiquitination enhances the ability of Mdm2 to stimulate p53 ubiquitination. Of note, members of the UbcH5 family, which are the cognate E2s for an array of E3s including Mdm2 (21Saville M.K. Sparks A. Xirodimas D.P. Wardrop J. Stevenson L.F. Bourdon J.C. Woods Y.L. Lane D.P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 42169-42181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), contain a ubiquitin binding domain (UBD) (15Brzovic P.S. Lissounov A. Christensen D.E. Hoyt D.W. Klevit R.E. A UbcH5/ubiquitin noncovalent complex is required for processive BRCA1-directed ubiquitination.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 873-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 22Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Ubiquitin binding domains.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The UBD is required for the processivity of UbcH5-mediated auto-ubiquitination of the RING domain ligase BRCA1 (15Brzovic P.S. Lissounov A. Christensen D.E. Hoyt D.W. Klevit R.E. A UbcH5/ubiquitin noncovalent complex is required for processive BRCA1-directed ubiquitination.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 873-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the polyubiquitin chains on Mdm2 could simultaneously recruit multiple E2∼Ubs through binding to their UBDs, thereby circumventing the requirement for multiple rounds of E2 recharging. To test this possibility, we compared the interactions of ubiquitinated and unmodified Mdm2 with recombinant UbcH5c (Fig. 4C) in an in vitro pulldown assay. Because of the transient nature of the E2-E3 interaction (2Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar, 4Ye Y. Rape M. Building ubiquitin chains: E2 enzymes at work.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), we employed chemical cross-linking to stabilize the binding. The interaction of UbcH5c with ubiquitinated Mdm2 could be readily detected under these conditions, but the interaction between UbcH5c and unmodified Mdm2 could not (Fig. 4D, lanes 1–3). In accordance with the lack of a stimulating effect of mono-ubiquitination on Mdm2 substrate E3 activity (Fig. 3D), the interaction between UbcH5c and mono-ubiquitinated Mdm2 could not be detected under these conditions (Fig. 4E). These results suggest that polyubiquitin chains on Mdm2 may enhance the recruitment of E2 enzymes. To examine the functional importance of the noncovalent E2-ubiquitin interaction, we used E2 and ubiquitin mutations that impair the noncovalent interaction. Mutation of Ser22 within the UBD to Arg (S22R) impaired the interaction of UbcH5c with ubiquitin (15Brzovic P.S. Lissounov A. Christensen D.E. Hoyt D.W. Klevit R.E. A UbcH5/ubiquitin noncovalent complex is required for processive BRCA1-directed ubiquitination.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 873-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), whereas it did not affect the overall structure of UbcH5c (15Brzovic P.S. Lissounov A. Christensen D.E. Hoyt D.W. Klevit R.E. A UbcH5/ubiquitin noncovalent complex is required for processive BRCA1-directed ubiquitination.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 873-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) or its thioesterification with ubiquitin (Fig. 5A). Unlike WT UbcH5c, the UbcH5c S22R mutant showed no enhanced binding to automodified Mdm2 (Fig. 4D, lanes 4–6). Moreover, in the presence of S22R, automodified Mdm2 became ineffective at conjugating p53 with WT ubiquitin (Fig. 5B) and even less effective at conjugating p53 with Lys48-only ubiquitin (Fig. 2B, lanes 8–13). Most UBDs contact a hydrophobic surface on ubiquitin that is centered on Ile44 (23Beal R.E. Toscano-Cantaffa D. Young P. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. The hydrophobic effect contributes to polyubiquitin chain recognition.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mdm2 conjugated with I44A ubiquitin showed no increase in binding to UbcH5c (Fig. 6A). We performed Mdm2 auto-ubiquitination using either I44A ubiquitin for different times (30 and 45 min) or WT ubiquitin for a shorter time (10 min) (Fig. 6B). Mdm2 conjugated with I44A ubiquitin showed noticeably reduced activity compared with Mdm2 conjugated with WT ubiquitin, especially at early time points (2 and 5 min) (Fig. 6C). Mdm2 with longer I44A ubiquitination (45 min) had even less activity compared with Mdm2 with shorter I44A ubiquitination (30 min). Therefore, when the E2 and ubiquitin chains on Mdm2 cannot bind to each other, auto-ubiquitination becomes ineffective at stimulating Mdm2 substrate E3 activity. The current study shows that auto-ubiquitination of Mdm2 results in an enhanced substrate ubiquitin ligase activity. It also suggests a model where the polyubiquitin chains on an E3 act as “landing pads” for UbcH5∼Ub through the noncovalent ubiquitin-UbcH5 interaction (Fig. 7). The noncovalent ubiquitin-UbcH5 interaction has been shown to facilitate the assembly of UbcH5∼Ub into homo-oligomeric complexes (15Brzovic P.S. Lissounov A. Christensen D.E. Hoyt D.W. Klevit R.E. A UbcH5/ubiquitin noncovalent complex is required for processive BRCA1-directed ubiquitination.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 873-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), which may further enrich UbcH5∼Ub in the proximity of the E3-bound target protein. The increased local concentration of E2∼Ub may overcome the rate-limiting step of E2 recruitment and permit processive ubiquitination of the substrate. Auto-ubiquitination is a general feature of RING domain E3 ligases. We speculate that auto-ubiquitination may also augment the activity of other multiple-domain RING ligases that use members of the UbcH5 family as their cognate E2s. In principle, auto-ubiquitination can accelerate other steps of ubiquitination and could be an activating event for multiple-domain RING ligases that employ E2s without an UBD. Of note, for Cul1-based CRLs, the rapid E2-E3 association and dissociation, albeit facilitating substrate ubiquitination, cannot fully account for the high processivity of the reaction (6Kleiger G. Saha A. Lewis S. Kuhlman B. Deshaies R.J. Rapid E2-E3 assembly and disassembly enable processive ubiquitylation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase substrates.Cell. 2009; 139: 957-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to determine whether auto-ubiquitination also enhances the substrate E3 activity of these CRLs. Certain enzymes can be activated through autocatalytic action, as exemplified by the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases by autophosphorylation (25Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Cell signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases.Cell. 2010; 141: 1117-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3106) Google Scholar) and of apoptotic proteases (caspases) by autoproteolytic cleavage (26Chang H.Y. Yang X. Proteases for cell suicide: functions and regulation of caspases.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 821-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The results presented here further support the notion that autocatalytic action is a prevalent mechanism for switching on enzymatic activity. Like receptor tyrosine kinases and caspases, ubiquitin ligases catalyze a post-translational modification that has profound effects on various target proteins and that, if not controlled properly, can have deleterious consequences to the cell and the organism. Thus, it is vital to synthesize these enzymes with minimal or no activity and to activate them in a controlled manner. Autocatalytic activation, as opposed to trans-activation by molecules of the same class or a different class of enzymes, would offer important advantages. It is highly efficient because of the reduced reliance on other enzymes. From an evolutionary point of view, autocatalytic activation might also be a necessity. When a new class of enzyme emerged, other regulatory proteins might not initially be able to perform the task, or might not even exist. Perhaps more importantly, autocatalytic activation, as opposed to autocatalytic inhibition, engenders a built-in quality control mechanism: proteins that cannot fulfill the intended function would not become activated. Nevertheless, if it is influenced by concentrations of E3 ligases, autocatalytic activation also enables a negative regulatory mechanism of these ligases. As demonstrated for the receptor tyrosine kinases and for the precursors of caspase, the autocatalytic activation can be induced by dimerization or oligomerization (25Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Cell signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases.Cell. 2010; 141: 1117-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3106) Google Scholar, 27Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Autoproteolytic activation of pro-caspases by oligomerization.Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Activation of Mdm2 is also likely induced by its homo-oligomerization or hetero-oligomerization with MdmX mediated by the RING domains on these proteins, especially the C-terminal amino acids of these domains (28Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. MDM2 interacts with MDMX through their RING finger domains.FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 29Poyurovsky M.V. Priest C. Kentsis A. Borden K.L. Pan Z.Q. Pavletich N. Prives C.

Vousden K.H. An essential function of the extreme C-terminus of MDM2 can be provided by MDMX.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Mdm2 oligomers exhibit enhanced E3 activity compared with Mdm2 monomers (29Poyurovsky M.V. Priest C. Kentsis A. Borden K.L. Pan Z.Q. Pavletich N. Prives C. The Mdm2 RING domain C-terminus is required for supramolecular assembly and ubiquitin ligase activity.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), indicating an important role of oligomerization in Mdm2 activation. Oligomerization also facilitates the auto-ubiquitination of Mdm2 or the Mdm2-MdmX complex. In a heterodimer formed by the RING domains of these proteins, self-ubiquitination occurs in trans, with Mdm2 ubiquitinating MdmX but not itself (31Linke K. Mace P.D. Smith C.A. Vaux D.L. Silke J. Day C.L. Structure of the MDM2/MDMX RING domain heterodimer reveals dimerization is required for their ubiquitylation in trans.Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The reasons for this selective ubiquitination are not completely clear, as the RING domains of Mdm2 and MdmX in this complex appear to adapt nearly identical structures. It is proposed that in an Mdm2 RING homodimer, one Mdm2 molecule might take on the role as a substrate, whereas the other one as the enzyme (31Linke K. Mace P.D. Smith C.A. Vaux D.L. Silke J. Day C.L. Structure of the MDM2/MDMX RING domain heterodimer reveals dimerization is required for their ubiquitylation in trans.Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Still, it is possible that in the complex formed by full-length Mdm2 or Mdm2 and MdmX proteins, auto-ubiquitination may occur in cis, as well as in trans. Also, the auto-ubiquitination may occur between different complexes instead of within the same complex. A precedent for the latter is shown for the activation of caspases, where the activating cleavage events occur between dimeric caspase precursors (24Chang D.W. Xing Z. Capacio V.L. Peter M.E. Yang X. Interdimer processing mechanism of procaspase-8 activation.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This scenario would make auto-ubiquitination especially sensitive to the abundance of Mdm2. Recent results from mouse models point to the importance of Mdm2-MdmX hetero-oligomerization for the ability of Mdm2 to restrain p53 in vivo. Mutation of the conserved cysteine residue in the MdmX RING domain, C462A, disrupts dimerization with Mdm2 and allows for p53 activation, leading to embryonic lethality by day 9.5 (17Huang L. Yan Z. Liao X. Li Y. Yang J. Wang Z.G. Zuo Y. Kawai H. Shadfan M. Ganapathy S. Yuan Z.M. The p53 inhibitors MDM2/MDMX complex is required for control of p53 activity in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 12001-12006Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Notably, in the MdmXC462A mouse model, disruption of heterodimerization results in less Mdm2 ubiquitination and higher levels of p53 and Mdm2. We envision a scenario where under physiological settings Mdm2 alone is unable to function as a potent E3 ligase probably due to its low levels and the relatively weak self-association. In comparison, the Mdm2-MdmX association may occur more readily, which triggers the formation of auto-ubiquitin chains that recruit multiple E2s to processively polyubiquitinate p53. Regardless of the precise mechanism, the activation of RING domain ubiquitin ligases such as Mdm2 likely follows a similar mode to the dimerization/oligomerization-induced activation of receptor tyrosine kinases and caspases. In this case, auto-ubiquitination likely rids the cell of excessive E3s when the concentration of an E3 reaches a threshold while no substrates are around, thereby allowing a homeostatic control of the levels of these ligases.

https://openalex.org/W1980805829,"Changes in concentration of pollutants and pathogen distribution can vary among ecotypes (e.g. marine versus terrestrial food resources). This may have important implications for the animals that reside within them. We examined 1) canid pathogen presence in an endangered arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) population and 2) relative total mercury (THg) level as a function of ecotype ('coastal' or 'inland') for arctic foxes to test whether the presence of pathogens or heavy metal concentration correlate with population health. The Bering Sea populations on Bering and Mednyi Islands were compared to Icelandic arctic fox populations with respect to inland and coastal ecotypes. Serological and DNA based pathogen screening techniques were used to examine arctic foxes for pathogens. THg was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry from hair samples of historical and modern collected arctic foxes and samples from their prey species (hair and internal organs). Presence of pathogens did not correlate with population decline from Mednyi Island. However, THg concentration correlated strongly with ecotype and was reflected in the THg concentrations detected in available food sources in each ecotype. The highest concentration of THg was found in ecotypes where foxes depended on marine vertebrates for food. Exclusively inland ecotypes had low THg concentrations. The results suggest that absolute exposure to heavy metals may be less important than the feeding ecology and feeding opportunities of top predators such as arctic foxes which may in turn influence population health and stability. A higher risk to wildlife of heavy metal exposure correlates with feeding strategies that rely primarily on a marine based diet."
https://openalex.org/W2001145498,"Fertilization in animals is a complex sequence of several biochemical events beginning with the insemination into the female reproductive tract and, finally, leading to embryogenesis. Studies by Kitajima and co-workers (Miyata, S., Sato, C., and Kitajima, K. (2007) Trends Glycosci. Glyc, 19, 85-98) demonstrated the presence of polysialic acid (polySia) on sea urchin sperm. Based on these results, we became interested in the potential involvement of sialic acid polymers in mammalian fertilization. Therefore, we isolated human sperm and performed analyses, including Western blotting and mild 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene-HPLC, that revealed the presence α2,8-linked polySia chains. Further analysis by a glyco-proteomics approach led to the identification of two polySia carriers. Interestingly, besides the neural cell adhesion molecule, the polysialyltransferase ST8SiaII has also been found to be a target for polysialylation. Further analysis of testis and epididymis tissue sections demonstrated that only epithelial cells of the caput were polySia-positive. During the epididymal transit, polySia carriers were partially integrated into the sperm membrane of the postacrosomal region. Because polySia is known to counteract histone as well as neutrophil extracellular trap-mediated cytotoxicity against host cells, which plays a role after insemination, we propose that polySia in semen represents a cytoprotective element to increase the number of vital sperm."

In humans, the macrophage protein CD163 acts as the scavenger receptor for hemoglobin (Hb) 3The abbreviations used are:Hb, hemoglobin; CCP, complement control protein; Hp, haptoglobin; Hpr, haptoglobin-related protein; SP, serine protease; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; SRCR, scavenger receptor cysteine-rich. leaking into plasma during intravascular hemolysis (1Kristiansen M.

In the first step of this scavenging process, the released Hb is captured by haptoglobin (Hp), an acute-phase protein patrolling the bloodstream in search for free Hb, which it binds almost irreversibly (2Hwang P.K.

The binding of Hp to Hb not only protects against the toxicity of Hb and its heme group (3Andersen C.B. Torvund-Jensen M. Nielsen M.J. de Oliveira C.L. Hersleth H.P. Andersen N.H. Pedersen J.S.

This Hp-CD163-dependent clearance system protects against the potentially hazardous Hb, which, if left in the circulation, may cause oxidative tissue damage and inflammation (5Lim S.K. Kim H.

Inside the macrophage, the proinflammatory heme is converted into metabolites with antiinflammatory effect (for review, see Refs. 7Etzerodt A. Moestrup S.K.

Moestrup S.K. Hemoglobin and heme scavenger receptors.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; 12: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In accordance with an overall antiinflammatory role, CD163 is up-regulated in antiinflammatory subtypes of macrophages (7Etzerodt A. Moestrup S.K. CD163 and inflammation: biological, diagnostic, and therapeutic aspects.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2013; 18: 2352-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Structurally, CD163 belongs to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) family of proteins characterized by the presence of SRCR domains in the extracellular region (10Martínez V.G. Moestrup S.K. Holmskov U. Mollenhauer J. Lozano F. The conserved scavenger receptor cysteine-rich superfamily in therapy and diagnosis.Pharmacol. Rev. 2011; 63: 967-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The SRCR domain is a conserved protein fold consisting of 100–110 residues. In CD163 nine such consecutive SRCR domains are contained within the extracellular region, followed by a transmembrane segment and a short cytoplasmic tail (11Law S.K. Micklem K.J. Shaw J.M.

Immunol. 1993; 23: 2320-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Hp is also a multidomain protein with a complement control protein (CCP domain) and a serine protease (SP) domain (12Greer J.

A single disulfide bond connects a CCP subunit with an SP subunit to form the basic (CCP-SP) unit of Hp (14Kurosky A. Barnett D.R. Lee T.H. Touchstone B. Hay R.E. Arnott M.S. Bowman B.H. Fitch W.M. Covalent structure of human haptoglobin: a serine protease homolog.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 3388-3392Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In its simplest form (Hp1-1), corresponding to the version found in most mammals, Hp has a dimeric structure where two (CCP-SP) units are connected by a β-strand swap and a disulfide bond between the CCP subunits (3Andersen C.B.

Humans have two allelic forms of Hp (Hp1 and 2) owing to a duplication of the CCP region involved in dimerization. Individuals with the Hp2 gene in one or both of the Hp loci express multimeric Hp variants (Hp2-1 and Hp2-2) that also bind to CD163 with high affinity (1Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H. Jacobsen C.

In addition to these variant forms of Hp, humans and other old world primates express an Hp-related protein (Hpr), which is 91% identical to Hp1 (15Bensi G. Raugei G. Klefenz H. Cortese R.

The high affinity interaction between CD163 and Hp-Hb is Ca2+-dependent and critically relies on the amino-terminal third of the extracellular SRCR region in CD163 (1Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H.

Using a panel of truncated recombinant CD163 variants, we have previously shown that SRCR domains 1–5 bind Hp-Hb with an affinity similar to the entire extracellular region of CD163 (19Madsen M.

In the ligand, comparative binding analyses with human Hp, Hpr, and Hp/Hpr hybrids have shown that the so-called loop 3 of the Hp SP domain plays an essential function in CD163 recognition of Hp-Hb (20Nielsen M.J.

The recently published crystal structure of porcine Hp-Hb reveals that this loop protrudes from the distal part of the Hp-Hb complex and small angle x-ray scattering measurements of human Hp-Hb in complex with recombinant CD163 SRCR domains 1–5 support the approximate zones of contact between the ligand and receptor (3Andersen C.B.

Structure of the haptoglobin-haemoglobin complex.Nature. 2012; 489: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In contrast to the complex of Hp-Hb, Hb and Hp alone exhibit weak or no binding to CD163 in humans (1Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H. Jacobsen C. Sonne O. Hoffman H.J. Law S.K. Moestrup S.K.

CD163 is the macrophage scavenger receptor for native and chemically modified hemoglobins in the absence of haptoglobin.Blood. 2006; 107: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Mapping of the CD163-(Hp-Hb) interaction surfaces is so far restricted to the human system, but a recent study in mice has uncovered subtle and major evolutionary differences in the Hb scavenging mechanism. First, the binding of Hb alone to CD163 is of significantly higher affinity than the corresponding interaction in humans; and second, Hp fails to elicit high affinity receptor binding upon complex formation with Hb in the mouse system (22Etzerodt A. Kjolby M. Nielsen M.J. Maniecki M. Svendsen P. Moestrup S.K. Plasma clearance of hemoglobin and haptoglobin in mice and effect of CD163 gene targeting disruption.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2013; 18: 2254-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ligand binding by the SRCR domain of the scavenger receptor MARCO also depends on Ca2+, and this domain has been shown to harbor a metal ion binding site composed of three negatively charged residues that are involved in ligand binding (23Ojala J.R. Pikkarainen T. Tuuttila A. Sandalova T. Tryggvason K.

A corresponding motif for Ca2+-coordinated clustering of acidic residues is present in SRCR domains 2, 3, 7, and 9 of CD163. Based on a series of binding experiments with mutated variants of both CD163 and Hp, we here present data pinpointing the contact region between CD163 and its high affinity ligand Hp-Hb and propose a common model for Ca2+-dependent coupling and uncoupling of ligand.

Likewise, the following human CD163 mutated variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a pcDNA5/FRT construct that encodes the five amino-terminal SRCR domains of human CD163 (CD163 SRCR1–5; amino acids 1–574) (19Madsen M.

All plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing using the Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany) sequencing service. Flp-In HEK293 cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cambrex Bioscience, Verviers, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Transfection with Hp mutant cDNA was performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics), and stable transfectants were selected with 150 μg/ml Hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Flp-In CHO cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in serum-free HyClone medium for CHO cells (Thermo Scientific). Stably transfected Flp-In CHO cells expressing CD163 variants were established by means of FuGENE 6 and subsequent selection with 750 μg/ml Hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Hp and CD163 expression products were visualized by subjecting growth medium and cell lysate to SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal anti-human Hp antibody (DAKOCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-CD163 antibody (1Kristiansen M.

We purified Hp and Hp mutants from serum-free HEK293 cell culture medium (Invitrogen) by Hb (Sigma) affinity chromatography as detailed previously (20Nielsen M.J. Petersen S.V. Jacobsen C. Thirup S.

Purification of human CD163 SRCR1–5 and mutated versions was performed by subjecting harvested cell culture medium containing secreted expression products to antibody affinity chromatography. The affinity column was generated by coupling 5 mg of the humanized anti-human CD163 antibody KN2/NRY (a gift from Cytoguide Aps, Aarhus, Denmark) to 1 ml of HiTrap NHS-activated HP (GE Healthcare) according to manufacturer's instructions. The harvested culture medium was concentrated and filtered before application on the column. After allowing the expression products to bind to the immobilized antibody, the column was washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, before elution with a solution containing 50 mm acetate and 500 mm NaCl, pH 5.0. Secondary elution was performed with 100 mm glycine HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 4.0. The collected fractions were neutralized by a Tris buffer, pH 8.0, and the proteins were stabilized by addition of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Fractions were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.75 mm KH2PO4), pH 7.4, at 4 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) or complexes of human Hp (mixed phenotypes, Sigma) and human Hb A0 (Sigma) were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To test for interaction with CD163 variants, beads were washed twice in MB buffer (2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, and 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.8) prior to incubation with growth medium harvested from CD163-transfected Flp-In CHO cells. Incubation was performed overnight at 4 °C, and the following morning beads were washed six times in MB buffer. Bound CD163 variant proteins were eluted by a lithium dodecyl sulfate-containing sample buffer and visualized by Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-CD163 antibody (1Kristiansen M.

Biacore sensor chips type CM5 were activated with a 1:1 mixture of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccimide in water according to instructions by the manufacturer. CD163 purified from human spleen (1Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H. Jacobsen C. Sonne O. Hoffman H.J. Law S.K. Moestrup S.K.

A control flow cell was made by performing the activation and blocking procedure only. Samples were dissolved in 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA, and 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4. Sample and running buffers were identical. Regeneration of the sensor chip after each analysis cycle was performed with 10 mm glycine, pH 4.0, containing 20 mm EDTA and 500 mm NaCl. Fig. 1 shows an alignment of the MARCO SRCR domain and the nine SRCR domains of CD163 demonstrating that the metal binding residues of MARCO are conserved in CD163 SRCR domains 2, 3, 7, and 9. To investigate whether the acidic triads in CD163 SRCR domains 2 and 3 play a role in Hp-Hb binding, we expressed recombinant CD163 SRCR1–5 mutated in the candidate metal-binding residues of SRCR domains 2 and 3 (Fig. 2A). Expression of a variant carrying mutations in the acidic triad of SRCR domain 2 (D185A,D186A,E252A) revealed a stable protein but absent Hp-Hb binding as measured by Hp-Hb-mediated pulldown analysis (data not shown). Mutation of the entire acid triad of SRCR domain 3 rendered the protein unstable, but single (E359A) and double mutations (D292A,D293A) in this acidic triad completely abrogated Hp-Hb-mediated pulldown (Fig. 2B and data not shown). In line with these results, simultaneous mutation of one or two residues in each of the acidic triads of SRCR domains 2 and 3 (SRCR1–5 E252A,E359A and SRCR1–5 D185A,D186A,D292A,D293A) led to stable expression products but inactivity in terms of Hp-Hb binding (Fig. 2B). To study the Hp-Hb binding properties in a more sensitive assay, three of the mutants (SRCR1–5 D185A,D186A,E252A; SRCR1–5 D292A,D293A; and SRCR1–5 E359A) were purified by antibody affinity chromatography (Fig. 2C) for use in SPR experiments. The resulting data showed that the SRCR domain 2 mutant protein (D185, D186A,E252A) has a significant reduction in affinity compared with the WT counterpart, and that effects of the single (E359A) and double mutations (D292A,D293A) in SRCR domain 3 are equally dramatic (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these binding analyses disclosed an essential role for the acidic triads of CD163 SRCR domains 2 and 3 in Hp-Hb recognition. In this part of the study we tested the hypothesis that basic residues in the ligand pair with Ca2+-coordinated acidic triads in CD163, an electrostatic pairing mechanism, that has previously been proposed to be a common theme of Ca2+-dependent ligand-receptor interactions (24Andersen C.B. Madsen M. Storm T. Moestrup S.K. Andersen G.R. Structural basis for receptor recognition of vitamin B12-intrinsic factor complexes.Nature. 2010; 464: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this model, Ca2+ plays an indirect role in ligand binding by positioning two or three negatively charged residues from the acidic triad for direct interaction with one positively charged residue from the ligand. In compliance with Lys/Arg playing an essential role in the CD163-(Hp-Hb) interaction, the presence of free Lys or free Arg efficiently inhibited Hp-Hb binding to CD163 in SPR binding experiments (data not shown). In contrast, free His was severalfold less efficient in inhibiting Hp-Hb binding to CD163. Basic residues in the CD163 binding region in Hp loop 3 were subsequently subjected to mutagenesis to identify potential Arg/Lys residues involved in receptor binding. A strong candidate was Lys-262 because a previous comparison of Hp and Hpr has shown that simultaneous substitution with Hpr-specific residues in positions 261, 262, and 264 in Hp loop 3 completely abrogates binding of Hp-Hb to CD163 ((20Nielsen M.J.

Analysis of single mutants (Hp E261A; Hp K262A; and Hp T264) (Fig. 3B) in SPR binding experiments revealed that the K262A substitution alone accounted for the eliminated binding of the Hp-Hb complex to CD163 (Fig. 3C). For comparison, the triple mutant with mutations corresponding to Hpr-specific residues (Hp E261K,K262W,T264A (Fig. 3A)) and a triple mutant with Ala substitutions (Hp E261A,K262A,T264A) were also included in this analysis (Fig. 3, B and C). To hunt down a second positively charged Hp residue with a crucial role in receptor interaction, we again turned to the previous mutational analysis of Hp/Hpr hybrids which had furthermore revealed that the triple substitution of Hp residues Asp-248, Gln-249, and Arg-252 into the corresponding residues of Hpr (Fig. 3A) resulted in inhibition of receptor binding (20Nielsen M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2064098644,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by airways remodelling. In mouse models IL-9 and IL-13 have been implicated in airways remodelling including mucus hypersecretion and goblet cell hyperplasia. Their role, especially that of IL-9, has been much less studied in authentic human ex vivo models of the bronchial epithelium from normal and asthmatic children. We assessed the effects of IL-9, IL-13 and an IL-9/IL-13 combination, during differentiation of bronchial epithelial cells from normal (n = 6) and asthmatic (n = 8) children. Cultures were analysed for morphological markers and factors associated with altered differentiation (MUC5AC, SPDEF and MMP-7). IL-9, IL-9/IL-13 combination and IL-13 stimulated bronchial epithelial cells from normal children had fewer ciliated cells [14.8% (SD 8.9), p = 0.048, 12.4 (SD 6.1), p = 0.016 and 7.3% (SD 6.6), p = 0.031] respectively compared with unstimulated [(21.4% (SD 9.6)]. IL-9 stimulation had no effect on goblet cell number in either group whereas IL-9/IL-13 combination and IL-13 significantly increased goblet cell number [24.8% (SD 8.8), p = 0.02), 32.9% (SD 8.6), p = 0.007] compared with unstimulated normal bronchial cells [(18.6% (SD 6.2)]. All stimulations increased MUC5AC mRNA in bronchial epithelial cells from normal children and increased MUC5AC mucin secretion. MMP-7 localisation was dysregulated in normal bronchial epithelium stimulated with Th2 cytokines which resembled the unstimulated bronchial epithelium of asthmatic children. All stimulations resulted in a significant reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance values over time suggesting a role in altered tight junction formation. We conclude that IL-9 does not increase goblet cell numbers in bronchial epithelial cell cultures from normal or asthmatic children. IL-9 and IL-13 alone and in combination, reduce ciliated cell numbers and transepithelial electrical resistance during differentiation of normal epithelium, which clinically could inhibit mucociliary clearance and drive an altered repair mechanism. This suggests an alternative role for IL-9 in airways remodelling and reaffirms IL-9 as a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2113321565,"Most genomic resources available for insects represent the Holometabola, which are insects that undergo complete metamorphosis like beetles and flies. In contrast, the Hemimetabola (direct developing insects), representing the basal branches of the insect tree, have very few genomic resources. We have therefore created a large and publicly available transcriptome for the hemimetabolous insect Gryllus bimaculatus (cricket), a well-developed laboratory model organism whose potential for functional genetic experiments is currently limited by the absence of genomic resources. cDNA was prepared using mRNA obtained from adult ovaries containing all stages of oogenesis, and from embryo samples on each day of embryogenesis. Using 454 Titanium pyrosequencing, we sequenced over four million raw reads, and assembled them into 21,512 isotigs (predicted transcripts) and 120,805 singletons with an average coverage per base pair of 51.3. We annotated the transcriptome manually for over 400 conserved genes involved in embryonic patterning, gametogenesis, and signaling pathways. BLAST comparison of the transcriptome against the NCBI non-redundant protein database (nr) identified significant similarity to nr sequences for 55.5% of transcriptome sequences, and suggested that the transcriptome may contain 19,874 unique transcripts. For predicted transcripts without significant similarity to known sequences, we assessed their similarity to other orthopteran sequences, and determined that these transcripts contain recognizable protein domains, largely of unknown function. We created a searchable, web-based database to allow public access to all raw, assembled and annotated data. This database is to our knowledge the largest de novo assembled and annotated transcriptome resource available for any hemimetabolous insect. We therefore anticipate that these data will contribute significantly to more effective and higher-throughput deployment of molecular analysis tools in Gryllus."

Heritable regulation of gene expression in mammals can be encoded directly within DNA sequences (genetic) or carried in modifications to the DNA or the nucleosomal histones used to package the DNA in the chromatin (epigenetic). The most well characterized DNA modification is the addition of a methyl group to the C5 position of cytosine, typically within the context of a CpG sequence (reviewed in Ref. 1Jurkowska R.Z. Jurkowski T.P. Jeltsch A. Structure and function of mammalian DNA methyltranserases.Chembiochem. 2011; 12: 206-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In normal mammalian cells, the majority of CpGs are methylated except CpG islands. Because of the increased frequency by which methylcytosines mutate to TpG, CpGs are under-represented in the whole genome (2Pfeifer G.P. Tang M. Denissenko M.F. Mutation hotspots and DNA methylation.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 249: 1-19PubMed Google Scholar). However, regions of unmethylated CpGs, defined by a minimum observed/expected CpG ratio of 0.65 and a GC content >55% over a distance of 500 bp, are known as CpG islands (3Tazi J. Bird A. Alternative chromatin structure at CpG islands.Cell. 1990; 60: 909-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Over 37% of these islands are located in the promoters of genes and ∼70% of known genes have a CpG island within a region 2 kb upstream and 1 kb downstream of the start site of transcription (4Takai D. Jones P.A. Comprehensive analysis of CpG islands in human chromosomes 21 and 22.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 3740-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Methylated cytosines serve as binding sites for the methyl-CpG binding domain proteins, MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, MBD4 (5Dhasarathy A. Wade P.A. The MBD protein family. Reading an epigenetic mark?.Mutat. Res. 2008; 647: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and Kaiso (6Prokhortchouk A. Hendrich B. Jørgensen H. Ruzov A. Wilm M. Georgiev G. Bird A. Prokhortchouk E. The p120 catenin partner Kaiso is a DNA methylation-dependent transcriptional repressor.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1613-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). These proteins, in turn, interact with other chromatin remodeling enzymes and cause methylated DNA to be compacted into a chromatin environment repressive for transcription (7Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Methylation induced repression-belts, braces, and chromatin.Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). Mammalian genomes encode three active DNA methyltransferases (DNMT): 4The abbreviations used are: DNMT, DNA methyltransferase; SPA, scintillation proximity assay; HTS, high throughput screen; 5-AZA, 5-azacytidine/VIDAZA; 5-DAC, 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine/DACOGEN; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography tandom mass spectrometry; CAT, catalase; SAR, structure-activity relationship; H2DCFDA, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. the de novo methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B and the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 (1Jurkowska R.Z. Jurkowski T.P. Jeltsch A. Structure and function of mammalian DNA methyltranserases.Chembiochem. 2011; 12: 206-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The genes encoding all three of these enzymes are essential for development, with the earliest lethality seen in Dnmt1 knock-out embryos (8Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Targeted mutation of the DNA methyltransferase gene results in embryonic lethality.Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). DNMT3A and -3B are able to act on unmethylated DNA to establish methylation patterns imposed during embryogenesis and gametogenesis (9Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are essential for de novo methylation and mammalian development.Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4488) Google Scholar). DNMT1 generally shows preference for hemimethylated DNA and is responsible for transmission of lineage-specific DNA methylation patterns during replication, but some evidence suggests the clear separation of target specificity may be an oversimplification (1Jurkowska R.Z. Jurkowski T.P. Jeltsch A. Structure and function of mammalian DNA methyltranserases.Chembiochem. 2011; 12: 206-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). DNMT1 may contribute to both de novo and maintenance methylation in certain regions of the genome alone or in collaboration with DNMT3A and DNMT3B (10Jair K.W. Bachman K.E. Suzuki H. Ting A.H. Rhee I. Yen R.W. Baylin S.B. Schuebel K.E. De novo CpG island methylation in human cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 682-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 11Liang G. Chan M.F. Tomigahara Y. Tsai Y.C. Gonzales F.A. Li E. Laird P.W. Jones P.A. Cooperativity between DNA methyltransferases in the maintenance methylation of repetitive elements.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 480-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). DNA methylation is known to regulate gene imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and transcriptional silencing of repetitive elements during normal development (1Jurkowska R.Z. Jurkowski T.P. Jeltsch A. Structure and function of mammalian DNA methyltranserases.Chembiochem. 2011; 12: 206-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). However, DNA methylation patterns are frequently distorted in cancer cells leading to aberrant gene expression. For example, hypomethylation of intergenic regions can occur, leading to activation of transposable elements and increased genomic instability. Likewise, hypermethylation of the promoters of many tumor suppressor genes, such as retinoblastoma gene 1, E-cadherin, and RASSF1A often lead to loss of tumor suppressor function in certain cancer cells and tumors (12McCabe M.T. Brandes J.C. Vertino P.M. Cancer DNA methylation. Molecular mechanisms and clinical implications.Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 3927-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Because DNMT1 and DNMT3B are overexpressed and amplified in numerous cancers, there has been considerable interest in the development of selective inhibitors. At present there are two approved compounds known to affect DNA methylation, 5-azacytidine/VIDAZA (5-AZA) and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine/DACOGEN (5-DAC) (13Jones P.A. Taylor S.M. Cellular differentiation, cytidine analogs and DNA methylation.Cell. 1980; 20: 85-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). Both are cytidine analogs that, upon cellular import, are converted to the activated triphosphate 5-aza-dCTP and subsequently incorporated into DNA. The nitrogen at the 5-position of 5-AZA causes an irreversible covalent complex to be formed between the carbon at position 6 in the incorporated altered nucleobase and the DNMT enzyme and triggers its proteosome-mediated degradation (14Foulks J.M. Parnell K.M. Nix R.N. Chau S. Swierczek K. Saunders M. Wright K. Hendrickson T.F. Ho K.K. McCullar M.V. Kanner S.B. Epigenetic drug discovery. Targeting DNA methyltransferases.J. Biomol. Screen. 2012; 17: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In recent years both compounds have shown promise in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome as investigators have shifted from using high amounts of drug based on maximum tolerated doses to lower doses that are more effective at decreasing DNA methylation and show less direct cytotoxicity (15Silverman L.R. McKenzie D.R. Peterson B.L. Holland J.F. Backstrom J.T. Beach C.L. Larson R.A. Further analysis of trials with azacitidine in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.

Results of a phase III randomized study.Cancer. 2006; 106: 1794-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Despite the clinical utility of 5-AZA and 5-DAC there is a need for inhibitors that do not rely on DNA incorporation for activity, and that show improved stability and selectivity. Selective DNMT inhibitors may allow targeting of diseases driven by a particular DNMT enzyme with reduced off-target effects. Such chemicals might also serve as useful tool compounds to better understand the biological roles of individual DNA methyltransferases. Knockdown of DNMT3B, for example, has been shown to selectively induce apoptosis of tumor versus normal cells and selectively reactivates methylation-silenced gene expression without causing global or juxtracentrameric satellite demethylation (17Beaulieu N. Morin S. Chute I.C. Robert M.F. Nguyen H. MacLeod A.R. An essential role for DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B in cancer cell survival.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28176-28181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Conversely, it has been reported that partial deficiency of DNMT1 prevented intestinal polyp formation in Apcmin mice (18Eads C.A. Nickel A.E. Laird P.W. Complete genetic suppression of polyp formation and reduction of CpG-island hypermethylation in Apc(Min/+) DNMT-hypomorphic mice.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1296-1299PubMed Google Scholar), whereas cre-mediated deletion of the Dnmt1 gene in fibroblasts from mice expressing a conditional Dnmt1 allele caused global demethylation and uniform p53-dependent apoptosis (19Jackson-Grusby L. Beard C. Possemato R. Tudor M. Fambrough D. Csankovszki G. Dausman J. Lee P. Wilson C. Lander E. Jaenisch R. Loss of genomic methylation causes p53-dependent apoptosis and epigenetic deregulation.Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The present report describes the identification of several DNA methyltransferase inhibitors using a novel scintillation proximity (SPA)-based high throughput assay. Whereas the majority of the identified compounds showed activity against both the maintenance methyltransferase, DNMT1, and the de novo methyltransferases, DNMT3A, at least one chemical inhibitor was identified as having a 30-fold preference toward DNMT1. Experiments that validate the capacity of this latter compound to inhibit global methylation in living cells are presented. Human DNMT1 (hDNMT1) was produced and purified as described previously (20Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. Recombinant human DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase. I. Expression, purification, and comparison of de novo and maintenance methylation.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). However, in the construct utilized, the amino-terminal 580 amino acids (Δ1–580) were absent (21Pradhan S. Estève P.O. Allosteric activator domain of maintenance human DNA (cytosine-5) methylatransferase and its role in methylation spreading.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5321-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The truncated enzyme was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells using a baculovirus expression system and purified by intein-CBD affinity chromatography. Human DNMT3B and DNMT3L (hDNMT3B + 3L) and murine DNMT3A (mDNMT3A; amino acids 220–908) were expressed from the pET28 vector in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Purification was carried out using nickel affinity column chromatography (22Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Structure of Dnmt3a bound to Dnmt3L suggests a model for de novo DNA methylation.Nature. 2007; 449: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (23Bradford M.M. Rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215700) Google Scholar). DNA methylation assays were carried out in a mixture of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol), BSA (2.5 μg), [3H]S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) (3.35 nmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), hemimethylated DNA substrate (5.45 ng), and varying amounts of purified enzyme in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. The DNA substrate used consisted of hemimethylated oligo #1 (5′-Biotin-Biotin-GATCGGATCCGG(5mC)GG(5mC)GG(5mC)GG(5mC)GG(5mC)GG(5mC)GG(5mC)GG(5mC)GG(5mC)GG(5mC)GG(5mC)GG(5mC)GGAGATCTCTAG-3′) annealed to unmethylated oligo #2 (5′-CTAGAGATCTCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGGATCCGA-3′). Both oligos were synthesized by Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). After 3.5 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of cold AdoMet and streptavidin PVT SPA beads (GE Healthcare). For the biochemical DNMT HTS, mDNMT3A (0.375 μg/reaction) was screened in a 384-well format using the assay described above with the first column of each plate reserved for the positive control sinefungin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 10 μm. Columns 2 and 23 were used for a neutral control (DMSO alone). The University of Texas Southwestern chemical library used for this screen consisted of ∼180,000 compounds from commercial sources (ChemDiv, ChemBridge, TimTek, Prestwich, and NIH collections) and ∼2,000 compounds synthesized by chemists at The University of Texas Southwestern all of which passed 48 structure-based filters that are designed to remove compounds with undesirable properties (e.g. reactive and/or undesirable functional groups) and that satisfy a relaxed version of Lipinski's rules for good oral bioavailability. After addition of cold AdoMet (100 μm) and the SPA bead (0.03 mg/well) mixture, the plate was covered and shaken at RT for 15 min. The plate was then left at RT overnight to let the beads settle and each sample was read with a Wallac1450 MicroBeta Trilux (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) the following day. Assay quality on each plate was assessed with the Z′ metric (24Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. A simple statistical parameter for use in evaluation and validation of high throughput screening assays.J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5325) Google Scholar) using the neutral and positive controls. Plates with a Z′ value <0.45 were deemed failed plates and repeated. The average Z′ value for all plates in the screen was 0.76. Test wells containing The University of Texas Southwestern chemical library (columns 3–22) were normalized using a row-average normalization method that outputs a normalized activity on a scale of 0–1. For the biochemical DNMT filter-binding assay, after reactions were completed and frozen, they were thawed and then blotted onto a DE81 filter mat. The filter mats were washed 3 times for 5 min with ice-cold 0.2 m ammonium carbonate, rinsed with cold dH2O, rinsed with cold EtOH, and dried in a microwave. The processed samples were then put in a sealed plastic bag with scintillation fluid and read on the MicroBeta counter using a filter mat cassette. When a more limited number of compounds were assayed, the reactions were individually blotted onto separate pieces of DE81 filter paper. They were processed as before and put in vials with 10 ml of scintillation fluid and read on a traditional scintillation counter. Data were plotted in GraphPad Prism 6 and a nonlinear sigmoidal dose-response curve fitted to the data to determine IC50 values. Secondary screening consisted of the following assays: a biochemical mDNMT3A SPA assay performed in triplicate on active compounds cherry picked from the library (1472 of ∼180,000 compounds, Z-score ≤ −3.86, row-averaged normalized activity ≤0.7); an assay designed to remove nonspecifically active colored compounds (Color Assay), which was performed in triplicate in the same manner as the biochemical SPA, except the compound was added after the 3.5-h incubation and before the addition of SPA beads; a biochemical SPA assay measuring activity of the RNA methyltransferase TrmA (5.55 μl of 4.5 μm RNA substrate: 5′-biotin-CGCUGUGUUCGAUCCACAGCG-3′, 2.925 μg TrmA/reaction, 0.1 mg of SPA beads/reaction); a biochemical SPA assay with hDNMT1 Δ581 (0.106 μg/reaction); and a biochemical SPA assay with Spiroplasma sp. strain MQ-1 (M.SssI) methyltransferase. The above secondary screening biochemical assays were normalized using a dimethyl sulfoxide control-average normalization method that also outputs a normalized activity on a scale of 0–1. The remaining compounds were also tested for DNA intercalation ability by one or both of the following methods. The first method was a high-throughput 384-well plate format utilizing deoxyribonucleic acid (4.8 μg/ml) from calf thymus DNA as a competitive inhibitor and ethidium bromide as a fluorescent dye indicator. Fluorescence was measured using an excitation of 320 nm and emission of 590 nm on the Wallac EnVision 2104 Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer). Daunorubicin hydrochloride (5 μm) from Sigma was used as a positive control and compounds were tested at 5 μm. The second method used the DNA Unwinding Kit from TopoGen, Inc. (Port Orange, FL) and results were visualized on a 1% agarose, 1× TPE, 0.2 μg/ml of chloroquine gel. Hydrogen peroxide generation was measured using a colorimetric assay based on the ability of horseradish peroxidase to catalyze the oxidation of phenol red and produce a change in absorbance at 610 nm after reaction termination as previously described (25Johnston P.A. Soares K.M. Shinde S.N. Foster C.A. Shun T.Y. Takyi H.K. Wipf P. Lazo J.S.

Technol. 2008; 6: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine the redox effects in the biochemical DNMT assay using hDNMT1 Δ581 (0.188 μg/reaction), the filter method was utilized but with the addition of varying concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and/or 50 units of catalase where appropriate. A549 and HeLa cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gemini Bio Products, West Sacramento, CA), 100 units of penicillin, 100 μg of streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm minimal essential medium-non-essential amino acids, and 0.1 mm minimal essential medium-sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HBEC30KT cells, a kind gift of Dr. John Minna, were cultured in ACL4 media supplemented with 2% FBS at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cell viability was determined by counting viable cells after trypan blue staining. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates in triplicate at a density of 4,000 cells/well and treated with varying doses of different compounds for 72 h. The compound was added at time 0 and again at 48 h with a media change for cell based assays measuring toxicity and in vivo methylation. Cell viability was evaluated by measuring ATP levels with CellTiter-Glo from Promega (Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Treated/control values were plotted in GraphPad Prism and IC50 values were determined from a nonlinear log(inhibitor) versus response-variable slope (four parameter) fit of the data. Reactive oxygen species was measured by a fluorimetric assay using carboxy-H2DCFDA as the probe. A549 cells were plated at a density of 5,000 cells per well into a black 384-well plate (Corning, Tewksbury, MA) and incubated overnight. Cells were then washed once with PBS and treated with 50 μm carboxy-H2DCFDA for 1 h. After washing three times with PBS, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of compound or 100 μm H2O2 as a positive control. After 4 h incubation, fluorescence was measured using excitation wavelength of 480 nm and emission of 520 nm on the EnVision Multilabel Reader. Genomic DNA from HeLa cells treated with compound for 72 h was isolated and purified using the Promega Wizard SV genomic DNA purification system. 5-AZA (6 μm) was used as a positive control. Global methylation levels were determined, following DNA hydrolysis, by an LC-MS/MS method as described previously (26Kok R.M. Smith D.E. Barto R. Spijkerman A.M. Teerlink T. Gellekink H.J. Jakobs C. Smulders Y.M. Global DNA methylation measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Analytical technique, reference values and determinants in health subjects.Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2007; 45: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). RNA from A549 cells treated with compound for 72 h was isolated and purified using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. 5-AZA (6 μm) was used as a positive control. cDNA was generated with 1 μg of total RNA with SuperScript III First-strand Synthesis (Invitrogen). The expression of RASSF1A was analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, as described previously with RNASE P used as an internal reference gene to normalize expression of RASSF1A (27Suzuki M. Sunaga N. Shames D.S. Toyooka S. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of DNA methyltransferase 1 leads to promoter demethylation and gene re-expression in human lung and breast cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The expression data are shown as a ratio of 1/ΔCt mean because untreated A549 cells did not show a quantifiable amount of RASSF1A expression. To further confirm the lack of RASSF1A expression in A549 and its induction by various compounds, a set of reaction products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel stained with EtBr (supplemental “Materials”). Genomic DNA from A549 cells treated with compound for 72 h was isolated and purified using Promega Wizard SV genomic DNA purification system. 5-AZA (6 μm) was used as a positive control. The DNA was deaminated as previously described (28Kilgore J.A. Hoose S.A. Gustafson T.L. Porter W. Kladde M.P. Single-molecule and population probing of chromatin structure using DNA methyltransferases.Methods. 2007; 41: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After bisulfite treatment, the RASSF1A promoter sequence was amplified from the deaminated DNA samples using forward primer 5′-GGGTTTTATAGTTTTTGTATTTAGGTTTTT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CAACTCAATAAACTCAAACTCCCCC-3′ with M13 sites and a hot start DNA Taq Polymerase. After amplification, the promoter sequence was purified and transformed into TOP10 cells using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing from Invitrogen. Colonies were tested for the RASSF1A promoter insert using colony PCR. DNA was isolated from positive clones using the PureLink Quick Plasma DNA Miniprep Kit from Invitrogen. Plasmid DNA was then submitted for Big Dye Terminator sequencing at the McDermott DNA Sanger Sequencing Core Facility at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center using vector primer T3. Sequence readouts were then aligned and compared using Sequencher 5.0 software. The analyzed CpG sites are named according to RASSF1A (Homo sapiens) GenBankTM accession NM_007182 with the start codon notated. A limited number of SW155246 analogs were generated to evaluate the role of the hydroxyl group on the 1-position of the naphthyl ring (see supplemental “Materials”). SW155246-1 lacks the hydroxyl on the 1-position of the naphthyl ring, whereas SW155246-2 possesses an O-methyl group at the same position. These compounds were subjected to the filter method for the biochemical DNMT assay using hDNMT1 Δ581 (0.153 μg/reaction). HeLa and A549 cells were treated with 10 μm SW155246 or 4 μm 5-AZA for 3 days, with the compound replaced on day 2. The cells were trypsinized and washed twice with 5 ml of PBS. The cell pellet was lysed on ice with 200 μl of RIPA buffer with 10 mm PMSF and 2 μl of 100× proteinase inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The cell mixture was pipetted several times to ensure cells were mixed well with buffer, then drawn into a 1-ml syringe with a 25-gauge needle 10 times to shear DNA. The BCA method was used to calculate the total protein concentration, and BSA was used as the standard. The cell lysates were mixed 1:1 with 2× Laemmli loading buffer and stored at −20 °C prior to use in the Western blot. Samples (25 μg/lane) were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4% stacking and 8% separation gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) at 80 V for 1.5 h. The blot was blocked in 5% nonfat milk and DNMT1 was probed with a 1:300 dilution of an anti-DNMT1 antibody (sc-207011, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and β-actin with a 1:200 dilution of an anti-actin antibody (sc-47778; Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C. A 1:2500 dilution of a rabbit IgG-HRP secondary antibody, (GTX213110–01 GeneTex, Irvine, CA) was used for DNMT1, and a 1:2500 dilution of a mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz) was used for β-actin. After washing, the blot was incubated with ECL solution (Thermo Pierce Scientific) for 1 min and exposed to x-ray film. A SPA was used to conduct a high throughput screen for inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases. Although the screening was conducted using mDNMT3A, a hemimethylated DNA template consisting of a biotinylated 58-mer with 12 methylated CpG sites annealed to an antisense 58-mer without biotinylation or methylation was utilized for the substrate so that subsequent secondary assays could evaluate compound specificity for the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 versus the de novo methyltransferases DNMT3A and -3B (Fig. 1A). Briefly, DNA template and enzyme were mixed together in 384-well plates in a buffer containing DTT to keep the enzymatic site of the methyltransferase reduced. Compounds were added and the reaction initiated by addition of tritiated AdoMet. In the absence of inhibitors, mDNMT3A methylated the available CpG sites with tritiated AdoMet. After a 3.5-h incubation, streptavidin-labeled PVT scintillation proximity beads were added. Oligos containing labeled CpG sites were brought into sufficiently close proximity to the SPA bead via the biotin-streptavidin interaction and light was produced. Wells containing putative inhibitors showed reduced light generation. Sinefungin, a AdoMet analog originally isolated from S. griseolus (29Schluckebier G. Kozak M. Bleimling N. Weinhold E. Saenger W. Differential binding of S-adenosylmethionine S-adenosylhomocysteine and Sinefungin to the adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase M.Taql.J. Mol.

Approximately 180,000 compounds were screened in singlet at a concentration of 10 μm in this assay (Fig. 1b). Using a Z-score of <−3.86 and a normalization value of <0.7 (30% inhibition), 1472 compounds were selected and subsequently cherry picked for further analysis. These compounds were re-screened in the SPA assay in triplicate. Using a more stringent normalized cutoff value of <0.534 (50% inhibition), 640"

At the same time, our subjective experience of colour does not change with age. The main purpose of this large-scale study (n = 185) covering a wide age range of colour-normal observers (18–75 years of age) was to assess the extent to which the human visual system is able to compensate for the changes in the optical media and at which level of processing this compensation is likely to occur. We report two main results: (1) Supra-threshold parafoveal colour perception remains largely unaffected by the age-related changes in the optical media (yellowing of the lens) whereas our ability to discriminate between small colour differences is compromised with an increase in age. (2) Significant changes in colour appearance are only found for unique green settings under daylight viewing condition which is consistent with the idea that the yellow-blue mechanism is most affected by an increase in age due to selective attenuation of short-wavelength light. The data on the invariance of hue perception, in conjunction with the age-related decline in chromatic sensitivity, provides evidence for compensatory mechanisms that enable colour-normal human observers a large degree of colour constancy across the life span. These compensatory mechanisms are likely to originate at cortical sites."
https://openalex.org/W2030500089,"Amphetamine, a highly addictive drug with therapeutic efficacy, exerts paradoxical effects on the fundamental communication modes employed by dopamine neurons in modulating behavior. While amphetamine elevates tonic dopamine signaling by depleting vesicular stores and driving non-exocytotic release through reverse transport, this psychostimulant also activates phasic dopamine signaling by up-regulating vesicular dopamine release. We hypothesized that these seemingly incongruent effects arise from amphetamine depleting the reserve pool and enhancing the readily releasable pool. This novel hypothesis was tested using in vivo voltammetry and stimulus trains of varying duration to access different vesicular stores. We show that amphetamine actions are stimulus dependent in the dorsal striatum. Specifically, amphetamine up-regulated vesicular dopamine release elicited by a short-duration train, which interrogates the readily releasable pool, but depleted release elicited by a long-duration train, which interrogates the reserve pool. These opposing actions of vesicular dopamine release were associated with concurrent increases in tonic and phasic dopamine responses. A link between vesicular depletion and tonic signaling was supported by results obtained for amphetamine in the ventral striatum and cocaine in both striatal sub-regions, which demonstrated augmented vesicular release and phasic signals only. We submit that amphetamine differentially targeting dopamine stores reconciles the paradoxical activation of tonic and phasic dopamine signaling. Overall, these results further highlight the unique and region-distinct cellular mechanisms of amphetamine and may have important implications for its addictive and therapeutic properties."
https://openalex.org/W2071799469,"Following penetrating injury of the skin, a highly orchestrated and overlapping sequence of events helps to facilitate wound resolution. Inflammation is a hallmark that is initiated early, but the reciprocal relationship between cells and matrix molecules that triggers and maintains inflammation is poorly appreciated. Elastin is enriched in the deep dermis of skin. We propose that deep tissue injury encompasses elastin damage, yielding solubilized elastin that triggers inflammation. As dermal fibroblasts dominate the deep dermis, this means that a direct interaction between elastin sequences and fibroblasts would reveal a proinflammatory signature. Tropoelastin was used as a surrogate for elastin sequences. Tropoelastin triggered fibroblast expression of the metalloelastase MMP-12, which is normally expressed by macrophages. MMP-12 expression increased 1056 ± 286-fold by 6 h and persisted for 24 h. Chemokine expression was more transient, as chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 8 (CXCL8), CXCL1, and CXCL5 transcripts increased 11.8 ± 2.6-, 10.2 ± 0.4-, and 8593 ± 996-fold, respectively, by 6-12 h and then decreased. Through the use of specific inhibitors and protein truncation, we found that transduction of the tropoelastin signal was mediated by the fibroblast elastin binding protein (EBP). In silico modeling using a predictive computational fibroblast model confirmed the up-regulation, and simulations revealed PKA as a key part of the signaling circuit. We tested this prediction with 1 μM PKA inhibitor H-89 and found that 2 h of exposure correspondingly reduced expression of MMP-12 (63.9± 12.3%) and all chemokine markers, consistent with the levels seen with EBP inhibition, and validated PKA as a novel node and druggable target to ameliorate the proinflammatory state. A separate trigger that utilized C-terminal RKRK of tropoelastin reduced marker expression to 65.0-76.5% and suggests the parallel involvement of integrin αVβ3. We propose that the solubilization of elastin as a result of dermal damage leads to rapid chemokine up-regulation by fibroblasts that is quenched when exposed elastin is removed by MMP-12.—Almine, J.

https://openalex.org/W2064756696,"The need to develop effective management strategies for insectivorous bat populations requires an understanding of factors influencing habitat use. Availability of pest prey, such as mosquitoes is likely to be one such factor. To assess whether this is the case, we radio-tracked Vespadelus vulturnus Thomas (little forest bat), a predator of Aedes vigilax Skuse (saltmarsh mosquito), in saltmarsh and adjacent coastal swamp forest during periods of high and low Ae. vigilax abundance. When mosquito abundance in structurally-open saltmarsh was similar to the more cluttered coastal swamp forest, use of saltmarsh by V. vulturnus was disproportionately greater than its availability, with saltmarsh selected preferentially for foraging. However, at times of low Ae. vigilax abundance in saltmarsh, use of saltmarsh by V. vulturnus was reduced and all habitats were used in proportion to availability in the study area. This is the first radio-tracking study to demonstrate a shift in foraging range by an insectivorous bat species correlated with fluctuations in the distribution and abundance of a particular prey resource. The shift in foraging range by V. vulturnus, corresponding with a spatio-temporal variation in abundance of Ae. vigilax highlights the importance of mosquitoes as a dietary item. Broadscale pest control of Ae. vigilax may have ecological implications for the diet and habitat use of V. vulturnus. An adaptive management approach is proposed, whereby careful monitoring of insectivorous bat populations is recommended before and after any application of broadscale mosquito control measures. We also suggest a precautionary approach is taken such that broadscale control of mosquitoes avoids the lactation period of bats, a time when their energetic demands are greatest and when there is reduced risk of contracting mosquito-borne diseases transmitted by Ae. vigilax."
https://openalex.org/W1999934751,"T-type Ca(2+) channels play diverse roles in tissues such as sensory neurons, vascular smooth muscle, and cancers, where increased expression of the cytoprotective enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is often found. Here, we report regulation of T-type Ca(2+) channels by carbon monoxide (CO) a HO-1 by-product. CO (applied as CORM-2) caused a concentration-dependent, poorly reversible inhibition of all T-type channel isoforms (Cav3.1-3.3, IC50 ∼3 μM) expressed in HEK293 cells, and native T-type channels in NG108-15 cells and primary rat sensory neurons. No recognized CO-sensitive signaling pathway could account for the CO inhibition of Cav3.2. Instead, CO sensitivity was mediated by an extracellular redox-sensitive site, which was also highly sensitive to thioredoxin (Trx). Trx depletion (using auranofin, 2-5 μM) reduced Cav3.2 currents and their CO sensitivity by >50% but increased sensitivity to dithiothreitol ∼3-fold. By contrast, Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 channels, and their sensitivity to CO, were unaffected in identical experiments. Our data propose a novel signaling pathway in which Trx acts as a tonic, endogenous regulator of Cav3.2 channels, while HO-1-derived CO disrupts this regulation, causing channel inhibition. CO modulation of T-type channels has widespread implications for diverse physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms, such as excitability, contractility, and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2035806918,"Degradation of purines to uric acid is generally conserved among organisms, however, the end product of uric acid degradation varies from species to species depending on the presence of active catabolic enzymes. In humans, most higher primates and birds, the urate oxidase gene is non-functional and hence uric acid is not further broken down. Uric acid in human blood plasma serves as an antioxidant and an immune enhancer; conversely, excessive amounts cause the common affliction gout. In contrast, uric acid is completely degraded to ammonia in most fungi. Currently, relatively little is known about uric acid catabolism in the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans even though this yeast is commonly isolated from uric acid-rich pigeon guano. In addition, uric acid utilization enhances the production of the cryptococcal virulence factors capsule and urease, and may potentially modulate the host immune response during infection. Based on these important observations, we employed both Agrobacterium-mediated insertional mutagenesis and bioinformatics to predict all the uric acid catabolic enzyme-encoding genes in the H99 genome. The candidate C. neoformans uric acid catabolic genes identified were named: URO1 (urate oxidase), URO2 (HIU hydrolase), URO3 (OHCU decarboxylase), DAL1 (allantoinase), DAL2,3,3 (allantoicase-ureidoglycolate hydrolase fusion protein), and URE1 (urease). All six ORFs were then deleted via homologous recombination; assaying of the deletion mutants' ability to assimilate uric acid and its pathway intermediates as the sole nitrogen source validated their enzymatic functions. While Uro1, Uro2, Uro3, Dal1 and Dal2,3,3 were demonstrated to be dispensable for virulence, the significance of using a modified animal model system of cryptococcosis for improved mimicking of human pathogenicity is discussed."

Neural stem cells are self-renewing, multipotent cells that can produce all of the major cellular phenotypes in the nervous system (1Reynolds B.A. Weiss S.

Neural stem cells are important, not only because they produce the entire complement of neuronal and glial cells of the mature nervous system and continue to generate new neurons throughout life, but also because they may be useful for the therapeutic replacement of cells in neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanisms that promote neural stem or progenitor cell (NSPC) 4The abbreviations used are:NSPC, neural stem/progenitor cell; APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; sAPP, soluble APP; APP-KO, APP knock-out; Aβ, β-amyloid protein; AICD, APP intracellular domain; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; AD, Alzheimer disease; EdU, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine; ANOVA, analysis of variance. proliferation are only partially understood.

The β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a 110–130-kDa integral type I transmembrane glycoprotein that has been extensively studied for its role in Alzheimer disease (AD) (4Small D.H. Mok S.S. Bornstein J.C. Alzheimer's disease and Aβ toxicity: from top to bottom.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Despite the very large number of published studies on APP, the normal function of APP has remained a mystery. APP is encoded by a single gene located on chromosome 21 (5Patterson D. Gardiner K. Kao F.T. Tanzi R. Watkins P. Gusella J.F. Mapping of the gene encoding the β-amyloid precursor protein and its relationship to the Down syndrome region of chromosome 21.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 8266-8270Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). APP is post-translationally glycosylated and phosphorylated and can be cleaved by two major proteolytic pathways. In one pathway, sequential cleavage of APP by α- and γ-secretase generates a large ectodomain fragment (sAPPα), which is secreted into the extracellular milieu, and a small C-terminal fragment (the APP intracellular domain or AICD), which may have a role in regulating gene expression. In the other pathway, cleavage of APP by β- and γ-secretase generates a different ectodomain fragment (sAPPβ), as well as the AICD peptide. Cleavage of APP via this second pathway also generates the β-amyloid protein (Aβ) of AD (6Nunan J. Small D.H. Regulation of APP cleavage by α-, β-, and γ-secretases.FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Although the normal function of APP is poorly understood, the pattern of expression of APP suggests that it may be important for neuronal growth and differentiation, not only in the developing brain but also in the mature or aging nervous system. The expression of APP has been shown to increase as the nervous system matures (7Small D.H. Nurcombe V. Moir R. Michaelson S. Monard D. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Association and release of the amyloid protein precursor of Alzheimer's disease from chick brain extracellular matrix.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4143-4150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). APP expression increases as NSPCs mature into neurons, and soluble APP has been reported to promote neural differentiation (8Lee J.A. Cole G.J.

Furthermore, we report that this effect is mediated by a secreted factor. Despite previous suggestions that sAPPα can influence the growth of neural stem cells (9Freude K.K. Penjwini M. Davis J.L.

Instead, we demonstrate that APP-induced NSPC proliferation is mediated, at least in part, by secreted cystatin C. Synthetic human sequence Aβ peptides (>95% pure) were obtained from the Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (New Haven, CT). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), B27 supplement, and poly-l-lysine were from Life Technologies Australia Pty. Ltd. (Mulgrave, Australia). Penicillin, streptomycin, human recombinant sAPPα, and human recombinant EGF were all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Pty. Ltd. (Castle Hill, Australia). Human recombinant bFGF was from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). The anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody (mAb) 6E10 was from Covance Pty. Ltd. (North Ryde, New South Wales, Australia). Mouse recombinant cystatin C, anti-mouse cystatin C antibody, affinity-purified polyclonal goat immunoglobulin G, and normal goat immunoglobulin G were from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-βIII tubulin mAb was from Promega Australia (Alexandria, Australia). Normal mouse immunoglobulin G, anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody were from Dako Australia Pty. Ltd. (Campbellfield, Australia). Newborn pups (postnatal day 0) of APP-KO mice (from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and their corresponding wild-type background strain controls (C57Bl/6), as well as human APP-overexpressing mice (APPSW Tg2576, from Taconic Farms Inc., Hudson, NY) and their corresponding background strain controls (C57Bl/6×SJL), were used for this study. Mice were housed in the animal facility at the University of Tasmania. All experiments were approved by the University of Tasmania Animal Ethics Committee. Primary neurosphere cultures derived from cerebral cortices of newborn mice (postnatal day 0) were prepared according to the procedure of Millet et al. (29Millet P. Lages C.S. Haïk S. Nowak E. Allemand I. Granotier C. Boussin F.D. Amyloid-β peptide triggers Fas-independent apoptosis and differentiation of neural progenitor cells.Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 19: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Brain cortices were cleared of meninges and hippocampus and then incubated in 1×TrypLETM Express with EDTA (Life Technologies Australia) for 10 min at 37 °C. Tissue was disrupted mechanically with a 1000-μl fine tip, and then the tissue was passed through a 40-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences, North Ryde, Australia) to remove undissociated cells. The single neurospheres were prepared by growing cells in suspension in T75 cell culture flasks at a density of 20,000 cells/ml in proliferation medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% B27, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), human bFGF (20 ng/ml), and human EGF (20 ng/ml). After 7 days in culture, neurospheres were dissociated mechanically with 200-μl fine tips, and cells were counted in a hemocytometer and then either reseeded as suspension cultures or replated as adherent cultures in 200 μl per well of proliferation medium on poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well plates at a density of 2000 cells/well. All cultures were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cell number was measured by alamarBlue assay (28Hayashi Y. Kashiwagi K. Ohta J. Nakajima M. Kawashima T. Yoshikawa K. Alzheimer amyloid protein precursor enhances proliferation of neural stem cells from fetal rat brain.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Dissociated cells cultured adherently on poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well plates were incubated for up to 6 days, and then 20 μl of alamarBlue reagent (Life Technologies Australia) was added into each well, and the cells were incubated for a further 4 h. The fluorescence intensity was determined using a FLUOstar Optima microplate fluorescence plate reader at an excitation wavelength of 540 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Cell number was expressed as the relative fluorescence intensity. Cell proliferation was measured by EdU incorporation. After 4 days in proliferation medium, cells were incubated with EdU for 8 h as described previously (30Young K.M. Psachoulia K. Tripathi R.B. Dunn S.J. Cossell L. Attwell D. Tohyama K.

Neurospheres were mechanically dissociated, and then isolated cells were plated at a density of 105 cells/well in 24-well plate. The cells were grown in a differentiation medium (DMEM containing 1% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2% B27 supplement, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin) for 5 days at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (8 g/liter NaCl, 0.2 g/liter KCl, 1.44 g/liter Na2HPO4, and 0.24 g/liter KH2PO4, pH 7.2) for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.03% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and then blocked in 4% goat serum in PBS for 20 min. Fixed cells were stained with mouse anti-βIII tubulin antibody (1:1000 diluted in 2% goat serum in PBS) and then incubated with a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000 diluted in 2% goat serum in PBS) and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at 1:7000 dilution. Conditioned medium was collected from neurosphere cultures that had been grown over a period of 7 days. To examine the effect of conditioned medium on NSPC proliferation, dissociated cells from neurospheres were cultured adherently on poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well plates in 100 μl/well of proliferation medium. Sixteen hours after plating, 100 μl of conditioned medium or normal proliferation medium (control) was added, and the cells were incubated for 3 or 5 days, after which proliferation was measured using the alamarBlue assay. The level of sAPPα and cystatin C in conditioned medium was determined by Western blotting. The volume per well of conditioned medium that was analyzed was adjusted so that it represented the same number of viable cells, as determined using the alamarBlue assay. Routinely, ∼10–30 μl was loaded into each gel lane for analysis. For the analysis of intracellular cystatin C, cells were washed with PBS and then lysed as described previously (31Cui H. Hung A.C. Klaver D.W. Suzuki T. Freeman C. Narkowicz C. Jacobson G.A. Small D.H. Effects of heparin and enoxaparin on APP processing and Aβ production in primary cortical neurons from Tg2576 mice.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e23007Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) prior to analysis by Western blotting. Proteins were separated on 8% (sAPPα) or 12% (cystatin C) sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) gels before being transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk powder in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline (pH 8) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with either anti-APP antibody (22C11 at 1:1000 dilution or 6E10 at 1:1000 dilution) or anti-cystatin C antibody (1:1000 dilution). Chemiluminescence reactions were monitored using a CHEMI-SMART 5000, and images were collected using Chemi-Capt 50001. For quantification of immunoreactivity, images of blots were analyzed using ImageJ version 1.46. For depletion of sAPPα or cystatin C from conditioned medium, mAb 6E10, anti-mouse cystatin C antibody, or goat immunoglobulin G (35 μg) was incubated with 500 μl of protein G agarose gel (Roche Products Pty. Ltd., Dee Why, Australia) overnight at 4 °C in 5 ml of PBS. The gel was then washed three times with 5 ml PBS, after which the gel was incubated with 5.5 ml of conditioned medium for 3 h at 4 °C. Finally, the gel slurry containing conditioned medium was centrifuged (10,000 × g), and the resulting supernatant fraction was assayed by Western blotting or used for cell proliferation experiments. RNA was extracted from the neurospheres of n = 6 independent mouse cohorts using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Pty. Ltd., Chadstone, Australia) as described by the manufacturer. Each preparation of neurospheres contained ∼106 cells. Six independent RNA extracts were obtained from each neurosphere preparation. cDNA was obtained from 400 ng of RNA with an RT2 First Strand kit (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. The cystatin C primers (Cst3) were from Qiagen, and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primers were from Geneworks Pty. Ltd. (Hindmarsh, Australia). GAPDH was used as an internal control. All primers were used at a concentration of 10 μm. All samples were diluted 1:10 and analyzed in triplicate. Standard curves for Cst3 and GAPDH with concentrations 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 μg were used to quantify Cst3 mRNA using SYBR master mix (Qiagen). The results were analyzed using a LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics Australia Pty. Ltd., Castle Hill, Australia). Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism software, version 5.04. Data were tested by one-way ANOVA or Student's t test. Post hoc comparisons were analyzed using Tukey's test. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Data values are presented as the means ± S.E. All results were derived from at least three independent experiments in which cells were derived from at least three different mice of the same strain. We first examined the level of APP in neurosphere cultures to confirm that the level of APP expression was higher in the Tg2576 cultures than in the background strain (C57Bl/6xSJL) littermate control cultures. At 2, 4, and 6 days after plating, conditioned medium was analyzed for APP by Western blotting with mAb 22C11,which recognizes both mouse and human APP and the APP homologue amyloid protein-like protein-2, and with mAb 6E10, which recognizes human sAPPα. The results confirmed that APP levels were much higher in the medium of Tg2576 neurosphere cultures than in the background strain cultures (Fig. 1A). A major band of 100–110 kDa was detected in the medium, corresponding to the molecular mass of sAPPα. Next, to examine the role of APP in NSPC proliferation, we compared the proliferation of cells derived from Tg2576 mice with that of the background strain controls. Neurosphere cultures were dissociated into a single cell suspension on day 7, and then cells were cultured adherently on poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well plates. The proliferation of the cells was measured using an alamarBlue assay. Fluorescence intensity in an alamarBlue assay was taken as an index of the number of viable cells. Overall, the growth rate of the cells derived from the Tg2576 mice was significantly greater (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's test) than that of the cells derived from the background strain mice (Fig. 1B). We also examined the growth of neurospheres to determine whether the proliferation of NSPCs was increased in the Tg2576 cultures. Neurospheres were cultured for a period of 7 days, after which they were examined under phase-contrast microscopy (Fig. 1, C and D). Neurospheres derived from Tg2576 mice were on average greater in size than the neurospheres from the background strain mice, confirming that the growth of NSPCs in Tg2576 cultures was greater than that of the background strain cultures. To confirm that the increased growth of the Tg2576 NSPC was due to a higher proliferation rate, we measured proliferation using an EdU uptake assay (30Young K.M. Psachoulia K. Tripathi R.B. Dunn S.J. Cossell L. Attwell D. Tohyama K. Richardson W.D. Oligodendrocyte dynamics in the healthy adult CNS: evidence for myelin remodeling.Neuron. 2013; 77: 873-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The percentage of EdU-positive cells in the Tg2576 cultures was ∼20% higher than the cultures derived from background strain mice (Fig. 1E). These results clearly supported the view that the increased growth observed using the alamarBlue assay and in the neurosphere cultures was due to an increase in the amount of NSPC proliferation. To determine whether the higher proliferation rate of the Tg2576 cells was also associated with a higher potential for neuronal differentiation, isolated NSPCs, grown adherently, were transferred to a differentiation medium containing 1% FCS but lacking EGF and bFGF. The cells were incubated over 5 days and then immunostained for the neuronal marker βIII-tubulin (Fig. 2). The results showed that there was an increased proportion of neurons in the Tg2576 cell population when compared with the cells derived from the background strain (C57Bl/6xSJL) mice (Fig. 2). Tg2576 cells also possessed longer, more extensive neurite networks than the background strain cells. To examine whether expression of endogenous mouse APP influences NSPC proliferation and to rule out the possibility that the increase in proliferation observed in Tg2576 cultures was due to a factor unrelated to APP overexpression, we also examined the proliferation rate of NSPCs from APP-KO mice. We found that NSPC proliferation was decreased in APP-KO cultures when compared with the corresponding background strain (C57Bl/6) cultures (Fig. 3). The growth rate of the APP-KO cells, as assessed by an alamarBlue assay, was ∼60% of that of the cells derived from background strain mice (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, neurospheres from APP-KO mice were smaller and less numerous than the C57Bl/6 neurospheres (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition, the percentage of proliferating EdU-positive cells was also significantly decreased. These experiments clearly demonstrated that endogenous APP was also involved in the regulation of NSPC proliferation. We also examined the capacity of APP-KO NSPCs to differentiate using the same procedure as described previously for the Tg2576 cells. The APP-KO cells were compared with the corresponding C57Bl/6 background strain cells. The total number of βIII-tubulin-positive cells was lower in the APP-KO cultures than in the background strain cultures (Fig. 4). We next examined whether the effect of APP on proliferation was mediated by a factor that was secreted into the culture medium. Conditioned medium was prepared over 7 days from Tg2576 and the corresponding background strain (C57Bl/6xSJL) neurosphere cultures. In parallel, dissociated C57Bl/6xSJL NSPCs were plated and incubated for 16 h. Conditioned medium from the neurosphere cultures or unconditioned proliferation medium was then added to the dissociated cell cultures. The amount of proliferation was measured after 5 days of incubation. There was a higher rate of proliferation in cultures containing conditioned medium (whether from C57Bl/6xSJL or Tg2576 cell"
https://openalex.org/W1999005653,"Recently, there has been much interest in describing the behaviour of animals by fitting various movement models to tracking data. Despite this interest, little is known about how the temporal 'grain' of movement trajectories affects the outputs of such models, and how behaviours classified at one timescale may differ from those classified at other scales. Here, we present a study in which random-walk state-space models were fit both to nightly geospatial lifelines of common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) and synthetic trajectories parameterised from empirical observations. Observed trajectories recorded by GPS collars at 5-min intervals were sub-sampled at periods varying between 10 and 60 min, to approximate the effect of collecting data at lower sampling frequencies. Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo fitting techniques, using information about movement rates and turning angles between sequential fixes, were employed using a Bayesian framework to assign distinct behavioural states to individual location estimates. We found that in trajectories with higher temporal granularities behaviours could be clearly differentiated into 'slow-area-restricted' and 'fast-transiting' states, but for trajectories with longer inter-fix intervals this distinction was markedly less obvious. Specifically, turning-angle distributions varied from being highly peaked around either 0° or 180° at fine temporal scales, to being uniform across all angles at low sampling intervals. Our results highlight the difficulty of comparing model results amongst tracking-data sets that vary substantially in temporal grain, and demonstrate the importance of matching the observed temporal resolution of tracking devices to the timescales of behaviours of interest, otherwise inter-individual comparisons of inferred behaviours may be invalid, or important biological information may be obscured."
https://openalex.org/W2028319373,"For advanced prostate cancer (CaP), the progression of tumors to the state of chemoresistance and paucity of knowledge about the mechanism of chemoresistance are major stumbling blocks in the management of this disease. Here, we provide compelling evidence that BMI1 polycomb group protein and a stem cell factor plays a crucial role in determining the fate of tumors vis-à-vis chemotherapy. We show that progressive increase in the levels of BMI1 occurs during the progression of CaP disease in humans. We show that BMI1-rich tumor cells are non-responsive to chemotherapy whereas BMI1-silenced tumor cells are responsive to therapy. By employing microarray, ChIP, immunoblot and Luciferase reporter assays, we identified a unique mechanism through which BMI1 rescues tumor cells from chemotherapy. We found that BMI1 regulates (i) activity of TCF4 transcriptional factor and (ii) binding of TCF4 to the promoter region of anti-apoptotic BCL2 gene. Notably, an increased TCF4 occupancy on BCL2 gene was observed in prostatic tissues exhibiting high BMI1 levels. Using tumor cells other than CaP, we also showed that regulation of TCF4-mediated BCL2 by BMI1 is universal. It is noteworthy that forced expression of BMI1 was observed to drive normal cells to hyperproliferative mode. We show that targeting BMI1 improves the outcome of docetaxel therapy in animal models bearing chemoresistant prostatic tumors. We suggest that BMI1 could be exploited as a potential molecular target for therapeutics to treat chemoresistant tumors."

https://openalex.org/W1970213158,"Over the last few decades, sessile benthic organisms from the Mediterranean Sea have suffered from the global warming of the world's oceans, and several mass mortality events were observed during warm summers. It has been hypothesized that mortality could have been due to a nutrient (food) shortage following the stratification of the water column. However, the symbiotic gorgonian Eunicella singularis has also presented a locally exceptional mortality, despite its autotrophic capacities through the photosynthesis of its dinoflagellate symbionts. Thus, this study has experimentally investigated the response of E. singularis to a thermal stress (temperature increase from 18 to 26°C), with colonies maintained more than 2 months under four nutritional diets: autotrophy only (AO), autotrophy and inorganic nitrogen addition (AN), autotrophy and heterotrophy (AH), heterotrophy only (HO). At 18°C, and contrary to many other anthozoans, supplementation of autotrophy with either inorganic nitrogen or food (heterotrophy) had no effect on the rates of respiration, photosynthesis, as well as in the chlorophyll, lipid and protein content. In the dark, heterotrophy maintained the gorgonian's metabolism, except a bleaching (loss of pigments), which did not affect the rates of photosynthesis. At 24°C, rates of respiration, and photosynthesis significantly decreased in all treatments. At 26°C, in addition to a decrease in the lipid content of all treatments, a bleaching was observed after 1 week in the AO treatment, while the AH and AN treatments resisted three weeks before bleaching. These last results suggest that, temperatures above 24°C impair the energetic reserves of this species and might explain the mortality events in the Mediterranean."
https://openalex.org/W1996943741,"Proteostasis is critical for the maintenance of life. In neuronal cells an imbalance between protein synthesis and degradation is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases during aging. Partly, this seems to be due to a decrease in the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, wherein the 20S/26S proteasome complexes catalyse the proteolytic step. We have characterised 20S and 26S proteasomes from cerebrum, cerebellum and hippocampus of 3 weeks old (young) and 24 month old (aged) rats. Our data reveal that the absolute amount of the proteasome is not dfferent between both age groups. Within the majority of standard proteasomes in brain the minute amounts of immuno-subunits are slightly increased in aged rat brain. While this goes along with a decrease in the activities of 20S and 26S proteasomes to hydrolyse synthetic fluorogenic tripeptide substrates from young to aged rats, the capacity of 26S proteasomes for degradation of poly-Ub-model substrates and its activation by poly-Ub-substrates is not impaired or even slightly increased in brain of aged rats. We conclude that these alterations in proteasome properties are important for maintaining proteostasis in the brain during an uncomplicated aging process."
https://openalex.org/W2171260203,"Dendritic cells (DCs) initiate host immune responses by presenting captured antigens to naive T cells. Hence, DC-binding peptides may be used for antigen targeting to boost naive and memory immune responses. By biopanning peptide phage libraries on human monocyte-derived DCs, we identified novel DC-binding peptides. One of the selected phages, displaying the NW peptide (NWYLPWLGTNDW), bound DCs with high affinity, and its binding was inhibited by the corresponding synthetic peptide. Antigenic peptides or proteins conjugated to the NW peptide bound to DCs and were internalized without negative effects on DC phenotype and function. Ex vivo targeted delivery of CMV-pp65 peptides to DCs via the NW peptide increased T-cell responses in HLA-A2(+)/CMV(+) donors compared to untargeted peptides (P<0.001). Stimulation of CD45RO-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CMV(-) donors with the NW-pp65 fusion peptides expanded pp65-specific precursor T cells. Moreover, the NW peptide mediated small interfering RNA delivery to DCs, and a significant gene silencing was obtained. Collectively, the data reveal that proteins and nucleic acids can be directed to DCs through the NW peptide, enabling effective uptake and functional effects such as T-cell activation in the context of MHC class I and II molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2128299831,"The mechanisms of allosteric action within pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) remain to be determined. Using crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis, and two-electrode voltage clamp measurements, we identified two functionally relevant sites in the extracellular (EC) domain of the bacterial pLGIC from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC). One site is at the C-loop region, where the NQN mutation (D91N, E177Q, and D178N) eliminated inter-subunit salt bridges in the open-channel GLIC structure and thereby shifted the channel activation to a higher agonist concentration. The other site is below the C-loop, where binding of the anesthetic ketamine inhibited GLIC currents in a concentration dependent manner. To understand how a perturbation signal in the EC domain, either resulting from the NQN mutation or ketamine binding, is transduced to the channel gate, we have used the Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission (PMT) model to determine dynamic responses of the GLIC channel and signaling pathways upon initial perturbations in the EC domain of GLIC. Despite the existence of many possible routes for the initial perturbation signal to reach the channel gate, the PMT model in combination with Yen's algorithm revealed that perturbation signals with the highest probability flow travel either via the β1–β2 loop or through pre-TM1. The β1–β2 loop occurs in either intra- or inter-subunit pathways, while pre-TM1 occurs exclusively in inter-subunit pathways. Residues involved in both types of pathways are well supported by previous experimental data on nAChR. The direct coupling between pre-TM1 and TM2 of the adjacent subunit adds new insight into the allosteric signaling mechanism in pLGICs."
https://openalex.org/W2099336671,"Signaling processes are primarily promoted by molecular recognition and corresponding protein-protein interactions. One of the key eukaryotic signaling pathways is the MAP kinase cascade involved in vital cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and stress response. The principle recognition site of MAP kinases, the common docking (CD) region, forms selective interactions with substrates, upstream activators, and phosphatases. A second docking site, defined as the DEF site interaction pocket (DEF pocket), is formed subsequent to ERK2 and p38α activation. Both crystal structures of p38α in its dually phosphorylated form and of intrinsically active mutants showed the DEF pocket, giving motivation for studying its role in substrate activation and selectivity. Mutating selected DEF pocket residues significantly decreased the phosphorylation levels of three p38α substrates (ATFII, Elk-1, and MBP) with no apparent effect on the phosphorylation of MK2 kinase. Conversely, mutating the CD region gave the opposite effect, suggesting p38α substrates can be classified into DEF-dependent and DEF-independent substrates. In addition, mutating DEF pocket residues decreased the autophosphorylation capability of intrinsically active p38α mutants, suggesting DEF-mediated trans-autophosphorylation in p38α. These results could contribute to understanding substrate selectivity of p38α and serve as a platform for designing p38α-selective DEF site blockers, which partially inhibit p38α binding DEF-dependent substrates, whereas maintaining its other functions intact. In this context, preliminary results using synthetic peptides reveal significant inhibition of substrate phosphorylation by activated p38α."
https://openalex.org/W2054037007,"The transfer of genetic information between unrelated species is referred to as horizontal gene transfer. Previous studies have demonstrated that both retroviral and non-retroviral sequences have been integrated into eukaryotic genomes. Recently, we identified many non-retroviral sequences in plant genomes. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary origin and gene transfer of domains present in endornaviruses which are double-stranded RNA viruses. Using the available sequences for endornaviruses, we found that Bell pepper endornavirus-like sequences homologous to the glycosyltransferase 28 domain are present in plants, fungi, and bacteria. The phylogenetic analysis revealed the glycosyltransferase 28 domain of Bell pepper endornavirus may have originated from bacteria. In addition, two domains of Oryza sativa endornavirus, a glycosyltransferase sugar-binding domain and a capsular polysaccharide synthesis protein, also exhibited high similarity to those of bacteria. We found evidence that at least four independent horizontal gene transfer events for the glycosyltransferase 28 domain have occurred among plants, fungi, and bacteria. The glycosyltransferase sugar-binding domains of two proteobacteria may have been horizontally transferred to the genome of Thalassiosira pseudonana. Our study is the first to show that three glycome-related viral genes in the genus Endornavirus have been acquired from marine bacteria by horizontal gene transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2058227237,"Controlled exposure experiments can be very informative, however, they are based on the assumption that pathogens maintained on artificial media under long-term storage retain the infective and pathogenic properties of the reproducing pathogen as it occurs in a host. We observed that JEL284, an in vitro cultured and maintained isolate of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), was becoming less infectious with successive uses. We hypothesized that passing an isolate propagated on artificial media through an amphibian host would make the isolate more infectious and pathogenic in subsequent exposures. To test our hypothesis, we used two discreet steps, a reisolation step (step 1) and a comparative exposure step (step 2). In step 1, we exposed eastern spadefoot toads, Scaphiopus holbrooki, to JEL284 and JEL197, another isolate that had been maintained in vitro for over six years. We then re-isolated JEL284 only from a successful infection and named this new isolate JEL284(FMBa). JEL197 did not infect any amphibians and, thus, did not proceed to step 2. In step 2, we compared infectivity and pathogenicity (mortality and survival time) of JEL284 and JEL284(FMBa) by exposing 54 naïve S. holbrooki to three treatments (JEL284, JEL284(FMBa), and negative control) with 18 individuals per group. We found that JEL284(FMBa) caused higher mortality and decreased survival time in infected individuals when compared to JEL284 and negative controls. Thus, our data show that pathogenicity of Bd can decrease when cultured successively in media only and can be partially restored by passage through an amphibian host. Therefore, we have demonstrated that pathogenicity shifts can occur rapidly in this pathogen. Given the potential for shifts in pathogenicity demonstrated here, we suspect Bd to have similar potential in natural populations. We suggest that, when possible, the use of freshly isolated or cryopreserved Bd would improve the quality of controlled exposure experiments using this pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W1993507479,"Three main reproductive strategies have been described among insects: most common oviparity, ovoviviparity and viviparity. In the latter strategy, the embryonic development takes place within the body of the mother which provides gas exchange and nutrients for embryos. Here we present the results of histological and EM analyses of the female reproductive system of the viviparous earwig, Arixenia esau, focusing on all the modifications related to the viviparity. We show that in the studied species the embryonic development consists of two “physiological phases” that take place in two clearly disparate compartments, i.e. the terminal ovarian follicle and the uterus. In both compartments the embryos are associated with synthetically active epithelial cells. We suggest that these cells are involved in the nourishment of the embryo. Our results indicate that viviparity in arixeniids is more complex than previously considered. We propose the new term “pseudoplacento-uterotrophic viviparity” for this unique two-phase reproductive strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2042623161,"The FATC domain is shared by all members of the family of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-related kinases (PIKKs). It has been shown that the FATC domain plays an important role for the regulation of each PIKK. However, other than an involvement in protein-protein interactions, a common principle for the action of the FATC domain has not been detected. A detailed characterization of the structure and lipid binding properties of the FATC domain of the Ser/Thr kinase target of rapamycin (TOR) revealed that it contains a redox-sensitive membrane anchor in its C terminus. Because the C-terminal regions of the FATC domains of all known PIKKs are rather hydrophobic and especially rich in aromatic residues, we examined whether the ability to interact with lipids and membranes might be a general property. Here, we present the characterization of the interactions with lipids and different membrane mimetics for the FATC domains of human DNA-PKcs, human ATM, human ATR, human SMG-1, and human TRRAP by NMR and CD spectroscopy. The data indicate that all of these can interact with different membrane mimetics and may have different preferences only for membrane properties such as surface charge, curvature, and lipid packing. The oxidized form of the TOR FATC domain is well structured overall and forms an α-helix that is followed by a disulfide-bonded loop. In contrast, the FATC domains of the other PIKKs are rather unstructured in the isolated form and only significantly populate α-helical secondary structure upon interaction with membrane mimetics."
https://openalex.org/W2146297267,"53BP1 contributes to activation of the G2/M checkpoint downstream of ATM and MDC1 in response to ionizing radiation and promotes nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) in mammalian cells. In order to determine whether the cellular activities of 53BP1 are conserved in the model organism C. elegans, we analyzed the function of its homolog, HSR-9 in response to DNA damage. Deletion or Mos1-insertion in hsr-9 did not affect the sensitivity of worms to double strand DNA breaks (DSBs), as reflected in embryonic survival and larval development. Nevertheless, the hsr-9 mutations, as well as a lig-4 deletion, reversed the hypersensitivity of rad-54-deficient worms to DSBs. In addition, oocyte chromosomal aberrations, which were increased by rad-54 knockdown in response to DSBs, were also reduced by the hsr-9 mutations. The hsr-9 mutations did not prevent the cell cycle arrest induced by DSBs in mitotically proliferating germ cells. However, they attenuated apoptosis induced by DSBs, but not when CEP-1 (a p53 ortholog) was absent, suggesting that HSR-9 functions in the same pathway as CEP-1. We concluded that the 53BP1 homolog in C. elegans is not directly involved in cell cycle arrest in response to DSBs, but that it promotes apoptosis and also a form of NHEJ that occurs only when rad-54 is deficient."
https://openalex.org/W2080421990,"General amino acid control (GAAC) is crucial for sensing and adaptation to nutrient availability. Amino acid starvation activates protein kinase Gcn2, which plays a central role in the GAAC response by phosphorylating the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), leading to the translational switch to stimulate selective expression of stress-responsive genes. We report here that in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Cpc2, a homolog of mammalian receptor for activated C-kinase (RACK1), is important for the GAAC response. Deletion of S. pombe cpc2 impairs the amino acid starvation-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α and the expression of amino acid biosynthesis genes, thereby rendering cells severely sensitive to amino acid limitation. Unlike the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cpc2 ortholog, which normally suppresses the GAAC response, our findings suggest that S. pombe Cpc2 promotes the GAAC response. We also found that S. pombe Cpc2 is required for starvation-induced Gcn2 autophosphorylation, which is essential for Gcn2 function. These results indicate that S. pombe Cpc2 facilitates the GAAC response through the regulation of Gcn2 activation and provide a novel insight for the regulatory function of RACK1 on Gcn2-mediated GAAC response."
https://openalex.org/W2129191639,"The small GTPase Rab27B localizes to the zymogen granule membranes and plays an important role in regulating protein secretion by pancreatic acinar cells, as does Rab3D. A common guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab3 and Rab27 has been reported; however, the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specific for Rab27B has not been identified. In this study, the expression in mouse pancreatic acini of two candidate Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC) domain-containing proteins, EPI64 (TBC1D10A) and EPI64B (TBC1D10B), was first demonstrated. Their GAP activity on digestive enzyme secretion was examined by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of EPI64 and EPI64B in isolated pancreatic acini. EPI64B almost completely abolished the GTP-bound form of Rab27B, without affecting GTP-Rab3D. Overexpression of EPI64B also enhanced amylase release. This enhanced release was independent of Rab27A, but dependent on Rab27B, as shown using acini from genetically modified mice. EPI64 had a mild effect on both GTP-Rab27B and amylase release. Co-overexpression of EPI64B with Rab27B can reverse the inhibitory effect of Rab27B on amylase release. Mutations that block the GAP activity decreased the inhibitory effect of EPI64B on the GTP-bound state of Rab27B and abolished the enhancing effect of EPI64B on the amylase release. These data suggest that EPI64B can serve as a potential physiological GAP for Rab27B and thereby participate in the regulation of exocytosis in pancreatic acinar cells."
https://openalex.org/W2015782111,"Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) and multivariate statistical analysis were used to investigate the processing technology of Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) leaf (pipaye, PPY). The differences in samples processed using different methods were revealed by unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA). In the scores plot of PCA, honey-processed PPY (PPPY), crude PPY (CPPY), and heated PPY (HPPY) were clearly discriminated. Furthermore, samples processed at different temperatures could also be distinguished; indeed, our PCA results demonstrated the importance of temperature during processing. Two unique marker ions were found to discriminate between PPPY and CPPY by orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), which could be used as potential chemical markers. The method was further confirmed by a verification test with commercial PPY. The orthogonal array experiment revealed an optimized processing condition with 50% honey at 140°C for 20 min after 4 h of moistening time, a process that provides significant information for standardized production."
https://openalex.org/W2022129620,"Prolactin is a versatile hormone with over 300 known functions and predominantly expressed in the pituitary. However, its expression has additionally been found in a number of extrapituitary organs. Recently, we described the expression of prolactin in the inner ear of mice, where it was correlated to age. Previous research has shown prolactin to be linked to abnormal bone metabolism and hearing loss due to changes in morphology of the bony otic capsule. Here we further investigated the relationship between prolactin, hearing loss and cochlea bone metabolism. BALB/c mice were tested for hearing using ABR at 6 and 12 months of age. Bone mineral density of the cochlea was evaluated using microCT scanning. Prolactin expression was calculated using quantitative real time PCR. Expression of the key regulators of bone metabolism, osteoprotegerin and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand were also determined. We found that prolactin expression was exclusive to the female mice. This also correlated to a greater threshold shift in hearing for the females between 6 and 12 months of age. Analyses of the cochlea also show that the bone mineral density was lower in females compared to males. However, no gender differences in expression of osteoprotegerin or receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand could be found. Further analysis of cochlea histological sections revealed larger ostocyte lacunae in the females. These results provide a possible mechanism for an age related hearing loss sub-type that is associated with gender and provides clues as to how this gender bias in hearing loss develops. In addition, it has the potential to lead to treatment for this specific type of hearing loss."
https://openalex.org/W2131962285,"The NSs proteins of bunyaviruses are the viral interferon antagonists, counteracting the host's antiviral response to infection. During high-multiplicity infection of cultured mammalian cells with Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus (BUNV), NSs is rapidly degraded after reaching peak levels of expression at 12hpi. Through the use of inhibitors this was shown to be the result of proteasomal degradation. A recombinant virus (rBUN4KR), in which all four lysine residues in NSs were replaced by arginine residues, expresses an NSs protein (NSs4KR) that is resistant to degradation, confirming that degradation is lysine-dependent. However, despite repeated attempts, no direct ubiquitylation of NSs in infected cells could be demonstrated. This suggests that degradation of NSs, although lysine-dependent, may be achieved through an indirect mechanism. Infection of cultured mammalian cells or mice indicated no disadvantage for the virus in having a non-degradable NSs protein: in fact rBUN4KR had a slight growth advantage over wtBUNV in interferon-competent cells, presumably due to the increased and prolonged presence of NSs. In cultured mosquito cells there was no difference in growth between wild-type BUNV and rBUN4KR, but surprisingly NSs4KR was not stabilised compared to the wild-type NSs protein."
https://openalex.org/W1992790702,"Ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) channels control synaptic activity. The crystallographic structure of GluA2, the prototypical iGluR, reveals a clamshell-like ligand-binding domain (LBD) that closes in the presence of glutamate to open a gate on the pore lining α-helix. How LBD closure leads to gate opening remains unclear. Here, we show that bending the pore helix at a highly conserved alanine residue (Ala-621) below the gate is responsible for channel opening. Substituting Ala-621 with the smaller more flexible glycine resulted in a basally active, nondesensitizing channel with ∼39-fold increase in glutamate potency without affecting surface expression or binding. On GluA2(A621G), the partial agonist kainate showed efficacy similar to a full agonist, and competitive antagonists CNQX and DNQX acted as a partial agonists. Met-629 in GluA2 sits above the gate and is critical in transmitting LBD closure to the gate. Substituting Met-629 with the flexible glycine resulted in reduced channel activity and glutamate potency. The pore regions in potassium channels are structurally similar to iGluRs. Whereas potassium channels typically use glycines as a hinge for gating, iGluRs use the less flexible alanine as a hinge at a similar position to maintain low basal activity allowing for ligand-mediated gating."
https://openalex.org/W2096526556,For DNA sequences of various species we construct the Google matrix G of Markov transitions between nearby words composed of several letters. The statistical distribution of matrix elements of this matrix is shown to be described by a power law with the exponent being close to those of outgoing links in such scale-free networks as the World Wide Web (WWW). At the same time the sum of ingoing matrix elements is characterized by the exponent being significantly larger than those typical for WWW networks. This results in a slow algebraic decay of the PageRank probability determined by the distribution of ingoing elements. The spectrum of G is characterized by a large gap leading to a rapid relaxation process on the DNA sequence networks. We introduce the PageRank proximity correlator between different species which determines their statistical similarity from the view point of Markov chains. The properties of other eigenstates of the Google matrix are also discussed. Our results establish scale-free features of DNA sequence networks showing their similarities and distinctions with the WWW and linguistic networks.
https://openalex.org/W1971480068,"Background Channeling occurs when a medication and its potential comparators are selectively prescribed based on differences in underlying patient characteristics. Drug safety advisories can provide new information regarding the relative safety or effectiveness of a drug product which might increase selective prescribing. In particular, when reported adverse effects vary among drugs within a therapeutic class, clinicians may channel patients toward or away from a drug based on the patient's underlying risk for an adverse outcome. If channeling is not identified and appropriately managed it might lead to confounding in observational comparative effectiveness studies. Objective To demonstrate channeling among new users of second generation antipsychotics following a Food and Drug Administration safety advisory and to evaluate the impact of channeling on cardiovascular risk estimates over time. Data Source Florida Medicaid data from 2001–2006. Study Design Retrospective cohort of adults initiating second generation antipsychotics. We used propensity scores to match olanzapine initiators with other second generation antipsychotic initiators. To evaluate channeling away from olanzapine following an FDA safety advisory, we estimated calendar time-specific propensity scores. We compare the performance of these calendar time-specific propensity scores with conventionally-estimated propensity scores on estimates of cardiovascular risk. Principal Findings Increased channeling away from olanzapine was evident for some, but not all, cardiovascular risk factors and corresponded with the timing of the FDA advisory. Covariate balance was optimized within period and across all periods when using the calendar time-specific propensity score. Hazard ratio estimates for cardiovascular outcomes did not differ across models (Conventional PS: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.81–3.18 versus calendar time-specific PS: 0.93, 95%CI: 0.77–3.04). Conclusions Changes in channeling over time was evident for several covariates but had limited impact on cardiovascular risk estimates, possibly due to unmeasured confounding. Although calendar time-specific propensity scores appear to improve covariate balance, the impact on comparative effectiveness results is limited in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W2079409777,"Obesity is now a leading cause of preventable death in the industrialised world. Understanding its genetic influences can enhance insight into molecular pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets. A non-synonymous polymorphism (rs35859249, p.Arg125Trp) in the N-terminal TBC1D1 phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain has shown a replicated association with familial obesity in women. We investigated these findings in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a large European birth cohort of mothers and offspring, and by generating a predicted model of the structure of this domain. Structural prediction involved the use of three separate algorithms; Robetta, HHpred/MODELLER and I-TASSER. We used the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) to investigate familial association in the ALSPAC study cohort (N = 2,292 mother-offspring pairs). Linear regression models were used to examine the association of genotype with mean measurements of adiposity (Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference and Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) assessed fat mass), and logistic regression was used to examine the association with odds of obesity. Modelling showed that the R125W mutation occurs in a location of the TBC1D1 PTB domain that is predicted to have a function in a putative protein:protein interaction. We did not detect an association between R125W and BMI (mean per allele difference 0.27 kg/m(2) (95% Confidence Interval: 0.00, 0.53) P = 0.05) or obesity (odds ratio 1.01 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.77, 1.31, P = 0.96) in offspring after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, there was no evidence to suggest that there was familial association between R125W and obesity (χ(2) = 0.06, P = 0.80). Our analysis suggests that R125W in TBC1D1 plays a role in the binding of an effector protein, but we find no evidence that the R125W variant is related to mean BMI or odds of obesity in a general population sample."
https://openalex.org/W1964187955,"CD8+ T Lymphocytes (CTL) can control AIDS virus replication. However, natural selection favoring viral variants that escape CTL recognition is a common feature of both simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of macaques and HIV infection of humans. Emerging data indicate that CTL directed against alternate reading frame (ARF)-derived epitopes (a.k.a. cryptic epitopes) are important components of the total virus-specific response in SIV and HIV infection but the contributions of these responses during the critical first several weeks of infection have not been determined. We used a focused deep sequencing approach to examine acute phase viral evolution in response to CTL targeting two polypeptides encoded by ARFs of SIVmac239 in SIV-infected rhesus macaques. We report high magnitude CTL responses as early as three weeks post-infection against epitopes within both ARFs, which both overlap the 5' end of the env gene. Further, mutations accumulated in the epitopes by three to four weeks post infection consistent with viral escape. Interestingly, these mutations largely maintained the primary amino acid sequence of the overlapping Envelope protein. Our data show that high frequency CTL target cryptic epitopes and exert selective pressure on SIV during the acute phase, underscoring the importance of these unique immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1981679112,"N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) is a member of the type II AAA+ (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) family. It plays a critical role in intracellular membrane trafficking by disassembling soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes. Each NSF protomer consists of an N-terminal domain (N domain) followed by two AAA ATPase domains (D1 and D2) in tandem. The N domain is required for SNARE/α-SNAP binding and the D1 domain accounts for the majority of ATP hydrolysis. Little is known about the role of the N-D1 linker in the NSF function. This study presents detailed mutagenesis analyses of NSF N-D1 linker, dissecting its role in the SNARE disassembly, the SNARE/α-SNAP complex binding, the basal ATPase activity and the SNARE/α-SNAP stimulated ATPase activity. Our results show that the N-terminal region of the N-D1 linker associated mutants cause severe defect in SNARE complex disassembly, but little effects on the SNARE/α-SNAP complex binding, the basal and the SNARE/α-SNAP stimulated ATPase activity, suggesting this region may be involved in the motion transmission from D1 to N domain. Mutating the residues in middle and C-terminal region of the N-D1 linker increases the basal ATPase activity, indicating it may play a role in autoinhibiting NSF activity until it encounters SNARE/α-SNAP complex substrate. Moreover, mutations at the C-terminal sequence GIGG exhibit completely abolished or severely reduced activities of the substrate binding, suggesting that the flexibility of N-D1 linker is critical for the movement of the N domain that is required for the substrate binding. Taken together, these data suggest that the whole N-D1 linker is critical for the biological function of NSF to disassemble SNARE complex substrate with different regions responsible for different roles."
https://openalex.org/W2029472344,"The Ras-adenylyl cyclase-protein kinase A nutrient-sensing pathway controls metabolism, proliferation and resistance to stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The genetic disruption of this pathway increases resistance to a variety of stresses. We show here that the pharmacological inhibition of this pathway by the drug triclabendazole increases resistance to oxidants, heat stress and extends the chronological life. Evidence is presented that triclabendazole decreases the intracellular level of cyclic AMP by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase and triggers the parallel rapid translocation of the stress-resistance transcription factor Msn2 from the cytosol into the nucleus, as deduced from experiments employing a strain in which MSN2 is replaced with MSN2-GFP (GFP, green fluorescent protein). Msn2 and Msn4 are responsible for activating the transcription of numerous genes that encode proteins that protect cells from stress. The results are consistent with triclabendazole either inhibiting the association of Ras with adenylyl cyclase or directly inhibiting adenylyl cyclase, which in turn triggers Msn2/4 to enter the nucleus and activate stress-responsible element gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2063698056,"Background To investigate the associations of secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure with medical consultation and hospitalisation among adolescents in Hong Kong. Methods A total of 35827 secondary 1 (US grade 7) to secondary 5 students from 85 randomly selected schools completed an anonymous questionnaire on smoking, SHS at home, SHS outside home, medical consultation in the past 14 days, hospitalisation in the past 12 months, and socio-demographic characteristics. Current smoking was defined as any smoking in the past 30 days. SHS exposure was classified as none (reference), 1–4 and 5–7 days/week. Logistic regression yielded adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for medical consultation and hospitalisation in relation to SHS exposure at home and outside home in current smokers. Analyses were also done among never-smokers for comparison. Results Among all students, 15.9% had medical consultation and 5.2% had been hospitalised. Any SHS exposure at home was associated with AORs (95% CI) for medical consultation and hospitalisation of 1.69 (1.14–2.51) and 2.85 (1.47–5.52) in current smokers, and 1.03 (0.91–1.15) and 1.25 (1.02–1.54) in never-smokers, respectively, (P<0.01 for interaction between smoking status and SHS exposure at home). SHS exposure outside home was generally not associated with medical consultation and hospitalisation in smokers and never-smokers. Conclusions SHS exposure at home was associated with health services use among adolescent current smokers. Adolescent smokers should be aware of the harm of SHS in addition to that from their own smoking. The evidence helps health care professionals to advise adolescent smokers to avoid SHS exposure and stop smoking."
