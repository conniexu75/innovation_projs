To clarify the role of TGF-β signaling in stromal fibroblasts during mammary development and tumorigenesis, we conditionally knocked out the TGF-β type II receptor gene in mouse mammary fibroblasts (Tgfbr2fspKO). Tgfbr2fspKO mice exhibit defective mammary ductal development, characterized in part by increased ductal epithelial cell turnover associated with an increase in stromal fibroblast abundance. Tgfbr2fspKO mammary fibroblasts transplanted with mammary carcinoma cells promote growth and invasion, which is associated with increased activating phosphorylation of the receptors: erbB1, erbB2, RON, and c-Met. Furthermore, the increased receptor phosphorylation correlates with increased secretion of the cognate ligands by Tgfbr2fspKO fibroblasts. Treatment of tumor cells with fibroblast-conditioned medium leads to increased tumor cell proliferation and motility, which are blocked by addition of pharmacologic inhibitors of TGF-α signaling or neutralizing antibodies to macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), HGF, or c-Met. These studies characterize a significant role for stromal TGF-β signaling in mammary tissue homeostasis and mammary tumor progression via regulation of TGF-α, MSP, and HGF signaling pathways."

We have recently described that thetranscriptional co-activator LEDGF/p75 strongly interacts with HIV-1integrase.

The choice ofintegration sites in cellular chromosomes is affected by the heterogeneousstructure of the chromatin. While in vivo HIV-1 integration is notsequence-specific, transcriptionally inactive regions of the genome, such ascentromeres and telomeres, are disfavored targets(1Carteau S. Hoffmann C. Bushman F.

Cell. 2003; 115: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In vivo,integration is mediated by a large nucleoprotein complex called preintegrationcomplex (PIC) containing the viral cDNA, together with viral proteins: matrix(MA), nucleocapsid (NC), reverse transcriptase VPR, and IN. The PIC carriesout DNA cutting and joining reactions(7Bukrinsky M.I. Sharova N. McDonald T.L. Pushkarskaya T. Tarpley W.G. Stevenson M. Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and HIV-1 infection mayinduce the cytoplasmic relocation of INI-1/SNF5, leading to its associationwith the incoming PIC (17Turelli P.

Werecently identified LEDGF/p75 as a new cellular binding partner for HIV-1 IN(18Cherepanov P. Maertens G. Proost P. Devreese B. VanBeeumen J. Engelborghs Y. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. J. Biol.

LEDGF/p75, a member ofthe hepatoma-derived growth factor family is a transcriptional co-activatorwhich plays a protective role during stress-induced apoptosis(20Ganapathy V. Daniels T. Casiano C.A. Autoimmun. Rev. 2003; 2: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). LEDGF/p75 has beenreported as a component of the PIC, and when its expression is silenced IN isfound mostly in the cytoplasm(21Llano M. Vanegas M. Fregoso O. Saenz D. Chung S. Peretz M. Poeschla E.M.

Here, we report that the interaction of IN with LEDGF/p75 is involved inintegration and replication of HIV-1. A single mutation in IN,Gln168 to Ala, disrupted the interaction with LEDGF/p75 withoutaffecting its catalytic activity and abolished the chromosomal targeting of INresulting in integration and replication-deficient viruses. Furthermore, themutation did not affect the nuclear import of HIV-1 integrase. Taken together,our data indicate that integration of HIV-1 is under the control of thecellular cofactor LEDGF/p75. Integrase Mutant Library—Integrase bait plasmid wasamplified in mutagenic conditions (0.2 mm dGTP, 0.2 mmdATP, 1 mm dCTP, 1 mm dTTP, 3 mmMgCl2) according to Cadwell and Joyce(23Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCRMethods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) using the followingoligonucleotides: GGGCTGGCGGTTGGGGTTATTCGCAACGGCGACTGGCTGGAATTC andATCATAAGAAATTCGCCCGGAATTAGCTTGGCTGCAGGTC. PCR product was digested by DpnI andtransformed in yeast with an open empty vector pB27 using classical lithiumacetate protocol. Mutant bait plasmids were obtained by homologousrecombination in yeast (GAP repair). 1.6 millions yeast clones were collected,pooled, and stored at –80 °C as equivalent aliquot fractions of thesame integrase mutant library. The mutation rate in the library was evaluatedby sequencing of 48 random non selected clones and was found to be of about0.5 mutation by the integrase clone. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening Procedure—Two-hybrid screens wereperformed using a cell-to-cell mating protocol(24Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A test screen wasperformed for each bait to adapt the screening conditions. The selectivity ofthe HIS3 reporter gene was eventually modulated with 3-aminotriazole (Sigma)to obtain a maximum of 285 histidine-positive clones for 50 millions diploidsscreened. For all the selected clones, LacZ activity was estimated byoverlay assay on solid media in a 96-well plate format. Inserts of all thepositive clones were amplified by PCR(24Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and then sequenced on anABI 3700 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystem). Screening of integrasemutant library was based on the loss of β-galactosidase activity. (i)After the mating experiment, yeasts were plated on DO-2 to select diploidscontaining bait and prey plasmids, then LacZ activity was evaluatedby overlay assay. (ii) 192 white and light blue colonies were selected from11,000 diploid yeast cells (containing integrase as bait and LEDGF/p75 as prey(amino acids 168–473). (iii) Inserts were amplified by PCR, sequenced,and analyzed. (iiii) Plasmids of interesting mutants were extracted andphenotypes confirmed by retransformation. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—All mutations weregenerated by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations ofthe pBru molecular clone were performed as described previously(25Petit C. Schwartz O. Mammano F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5079-5088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IN synthetic gene(INs) (26Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Claeys A. Proost P. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1389-1399PubMed Google Scholar)was PCR-amplified using the following primers:5′-GAAGATCTGGCGCTGGTGCATTCCTGGACGGCATTG-3′ and5′-CGGAATTCTTAGTCCTCATCTTGACGAGAG-3′. The resulting PCR fragmentwas subcloned between the BglII and EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech)thus generating the GFP-INs expression vector. The recombinantINQ168L and INQ168A mutants were generated by mutagenesis. The plasmid usedfor the PCR was pRP1012 coding for integrase with a N-terminalHis6-tag (R. Plasterk, Dutch Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, TheNetherlands). The following primers were used: INTQ168L,5′-GTAAGAGATCTGGCTGAAC-3′; INTQ168A,5′-GTAAGAGATGCGGCTGAAC-3′; and INTrev2,5′-TGCTGGTCCTTTCCAAACTGG-3′. The resulting PCR fragments were thendigested with DpnI, generating the pKBINQ168L and pKBINQ168A expressionvectors, respectively. In Vitro Integration Assay—The DNA substrate used in theenzymatic assay corresponds to the U5 LTR end of the HIV-1 genome. The INT1(5′-TGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT) and INT2 (5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACA)oligonucleotides were purified by gel electrophoresis on a denaturing ureagel. 5′-End labeling of INT1 was done using polynucleotide T4 kinase and[γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), followed by annealingequimolar amounts of INT1 and INT2 in the presence of 100 mm NaCl.The final reaction mixture for the integration assay contained 20mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2, 75 mm NaCl, 15% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 8000,15% dimethyl sulfoxide, 20 nm oligonucleotide substrate, and 1μm His-tagged IN (final volume of 10 μl). Reactions werestarted by addition of the enzyme and allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 60min. To stop the reactions, formamide loading buffer (95% formamide, 30mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% sodiumdodecyl sulfate) was added. Subsequent products were separated in a 15%denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gel and visualized with a PhosphorImager. Cells, Viruses, and Infections—HeLa and 293 cells were grownin Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetalcalf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units of penicillin/ml (Invitrogen), and 100μg of streptomycin/ml (Invitrogen). CEM-A301 cells were grown in RIPA(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units ofpenicillin/ml (Invitrogen), and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml (Invitrogen).Virus stocks were produced by transfecting 293 cells with pBru-derivedmolecular clones. Supernatants were collected 3 days after transfection, andthe levels of HIV-1 p24 antigen were monitored by enzyme-linkedimmunoabsorbent assay (BD Biosciences). CEM-A301 cells were infected withviral doses corresponding to 30 ng of HIV-1 p24 antigen per 106cells. Nuclear Import Assay—Nuclear import assay of Cy3-labeledrecombinant IN was performed as described previously(27Depienne C. Mousnier A. Leh H. Le Rouzic E. Dormont D. Benichou S. Dargemont C. J. Biol.Chem. 2001; 276: 18102-18107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in the presence of anenergy-regenerating system and in the absence of HeLa cell cytosol. Cells weresubsequently fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and LEDGF/p75 expression wasmonitored by indirect immunofluorescence staining. Indirect Immunofluorescence Staining—Transfected HeLa cellsgrown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde prior topermeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. For synchronization, transfectedcells were accumulated in prometaphase by nocodazole treatment (0.04 μg/mlfor 4 h). Mitotic cells were selectively harvested by mechanical shock, washedwith nocodazole-free medium, and transferred ontopoly-l-lysine-coated glass slides for 45 min, the fixed with 4%paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100. Rabbitpolyclonal antibody against IN (generous gift of J. F. Mouscadet) or mousemonoclonal anti-LEDGF (BD Biosciences) were applied for 30 min followed by a30-min incubation with Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG orfluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, respectively (JacksonImmunoResearch). When indicated, DNA was stained with Hoechst 33258. Cellswere mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst) or in phosphate-buffered saline containing50% glycerol. Images were acquired with a Leica DMRB epifluorescencemicroscope equipped with a CCD camera (Princeton) controlled by Metaviewsoftware (Universal Imaging Corp.). Cell Transfection and Immunoprecipitation Experiments—293cells were transiently transfected by electroporation with 10 μg of IN-FLAGexpression vectors alone or co-transfected with 10 μg of a HA-SNF5expression vector (a kind gift from C. Muchardt, Pasteur Institute, Paris,France). Twenty-four hours later, cells were washed twice inphosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 400 mm NaCl, 50mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100,containing 1 mm DTT and standard protease inhibitors (Sigma) for 30min on ice. Cell lysates were sonicated twice for 20 s, then debris waspelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C. Precleared supernatants were incubatedwith protein G-Sepharose loaded with anti-Flag M2 antibody (Sigma) at 4 °Covernight. The beads were washed four times in lysis buffer and analyzed byWestern blotting. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE andrevealed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2 peroxidase-coupled antibody(Sigma), anti-LEDGF (BD Transduction Laboratories), or anti-HA (Roche AppliedScience). Quantification of Three Different Viral DNA Forms during HIV-1Replication—CEM-A301 cells were infected with HIV-1 Bru WT ormutants viruses in presence of 1 μm Saquinavir, to limit viralreplication to a single round, and harvested at 3, 9, 24, and 48 hpost-infection. Samples were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and treatedwith 500 units of DNase I (Roche Diagnostics) for 1 h at 37 °C, prior toDNA extraction using a QIAamp blood DNA minikit (Qiagen). The amounts of totalHIV-1 DNA, two-LTR circles, and integrated HIV-1 DNA were quantified byreal-time PCR performed with the Light Cycler instrument (Roche AppliedScience) as described previously(28Brussel A. Sonigo P. J.Virol. 2003; 77: 10119-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Each sample was analyzedin duplicate. Briefly, the total HIV-1 DNA copy number was determined usingprimer that annealed in the U5 region of the LTR (MH531) and in the 5′region of the gag gene (MH532)(29Butler S.L. Hansen M.S. Bushman F.D. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Two-LTR circles wereamplified using primers spanning the LTR-LTR junctions (HIV F and HIV R1)(28Brussel A. Sonigo P. J.Virol. 2003; 77: 10119-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Integrated DNA wasquantified using an Alu-LTR-based nested PCR procedure. In a first round ofPCR, integrated HIV-1 sequences were amplified with two outward facing Aluprimers and a HIV-1 LTR-specific primer (L-M667) containing a λphage-specific sequence at the 5′-end of the oligonucleotide. In asecond round of PCR, we used specific primers for the λ sequence(λ T) and the LTR region (AA5M)(28Brussel A. Sonigo P. J.Virol. 2003; 77: 10119-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To eliminate the signaldue to primer extension carried out by the L-M667 primer during the firstround PCR, a control PCR assay was performed without Alu primers. The signalof the nested PCR obtained in the absence of Alu primers was subtracted fromthe integrated HIV-1 DNA signal. Copy numbers of total DNA two-LTR circles andintegrated DNA were determined in reference to standard curves prepared byamplification of cloned DNA with matching sequences(28Brussel A. Sonigo P. J.Virol. 2003; 77: 10119-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Results were normalizedby the number of cells and the amount of cellular DNA quantified by PCR of theβ-globin gene according manufacturer's instructions (Roche AppliedScience). Glutamine 168 of IN Is Involved in Interaction withLEDGF/p75—To demonstrate the role of the interaction ofHIV-1 IN with LEDGF/p75 in the viral replication cycle, we first mapped byyeast two-hybrid screening the IN interacting domain on LEDGF/p75 to adiscrete region of 102 amino acids in the C-terminal domain of the p75 isoformof LEDGF, located between amino acids 340 and 442 (data not shown). These dataare in agreement with the results from Cherepanov et al.(30Cherepanov P. Devroe E. Silver P.A. Engelman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48883-48892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) showing that theinteracting binding domain of LEDGF/p75 with IN is comprised between residues347 and 429. Then, we characterized the interacting domain for LEDGF/p75 onHIV-1 IN using yeast two-hybrid screening of a highly complex library of HIV-1random fragments obtained after nebulization of the HIV-1 DNA and inserted inthe prey plasmid (data not shown and see additional methods given in the supplemental material). By this technique, we could map the LEDGF/p75interacting domain in the catalytic core of IN between amino acids 56 and 182.Then, to identify the amino acids of IN required for interaction withLEDGF/p75, we screened by two-hybrid a library of HIV-1 IN random mutantsobtained by PCR random mutagenesis using LEDGF/p75 as bait. Several mutationsimpairing LEDGF/p75 interaction were characterized in the core region of IN,in particular two different mutants at position Gln168. Thesemutations were introduced in molecular clones of HIV-1 Bru, and viral stockswere tested for replication in A301 cells. With the notable exception of theGln168 mutants, all the other mutations affected the synthesis ofviral cDNA (data not shown). So we choose to focus our studies on the mutantsQ168P and Q168L, since the isolation of two independent mutants at thisposition is a strong indication about the importance of this residue forinteraction with LEDGF/p75. Effectively, both of these mutants were impairedfor LEDGF/p75 interaction, as estimated by a quantitative β-galactosidaseassay (Fig. 1A) and bythe lack of co-immunoprecipitation of LEDGF/p75 with IN-Flag168L(Fig. 1B and data notshown). In addition, we generated a more conservative mutation Q168A toconfirm that the lack of interaction with LEDGF/p75 is linked to the absenceof the WT residue Gln168 (Fig.1, A and B). We verified that these mutants weredefective for interaction with LEDGF/p75 but were still able to interact withSNF5/Ini1, another partner of IN (Fig.1C). We next tested whether these mutants remainedenzymatically active in vitro. Recombinant WT and mutant integraseswere purified from Escherichia coli, and both 3′ processing andstrand transfer activities were assayed in the presence of Mg2+.While both INQ168L and INQ168A displayed a wild type3′ processing activities, only the Q168A mutant displayed strandtransfer activity similar to that of WT IN(Fig. 1D). Notunexpectedly, the Q168P mutant was defective for both 3′ processing andstrand transfer activities (data not shown). To correlate the lack of interaction of IN with LEDGF/p75 to a potentialdefect in HIV-1 replication, the Q168A and Q168L mutations were inserted inreplication competent molecular clones of HIV-1 Bru, and viral stocks wereproduced. No difference in virus release was observed between these mutantsand the WT virus, suggesting that none of these mutations impair virusassembly or release (data not shown). In contrast, both of these viruses werefound completely defective for replication over 2 weeks in A301 cells andother T cell lines including Jurkat (Fig.2A and data not shown). Taken together, these resultsdemonstrate that disruption of the IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction by a singlemutation in integrase completely inhibits the replication of HIV-1. Viruses Defective for the LEDGF/p75 Interaction ArePredominantly Blocked at Integration—To determine whether in theabsence of interaction of IN with LEDGF/p75 the integration step isspecifically blocked during the replication cycle of HIV-1, total HIV-1 DNA,two-LTR circles, and integrated forms of proviral DNA were measured byquantitative PCR on cell extracts from A301 cells infected, respectively, withtwo LEDGF/p75 interaction deficient mutant viruses Bru IN Q168A(HIVQ168A) and Bru IN Q168L (HIVQ168L), whileHIVWT Bru and the catalytically IN inactive D116A mutant (BruHIVD116A) were used as controls(Fig. 2A). In thisexperiment, HIV-1 replication was restricted to a single round infection byaddition of a protease inhibitor. At 3-h post-infection, reverse transcriptionproducts peaked, and levels of early reverse transcriptase (strong stop cDNA)(data not shown) or late reverse transcriptase (total HIV cDNA) were similar(HIVD116A and HIVQ168L) or even higher(HIVQ168A) than that of the WT virus(Fig. 2B). Theseresults show that none of these mutations impaired reverse transcription. At 9h post-infection, the amount of total HIV cDNA dropped for the mutantHIVQ168L, while the amount of cDNA remained high for Q168A until 24h post-infection. We next monitored the formation of two-LTR circles that aregenerally accepted to reflect PIC nuclear import. All viruses were able toform two-LTR circles at about the same level at 9 h post-infection(Fig. 2C), indicatingthat all PICs were imported into the nucleus. Compared with the WT virus, a2–3-fold reduction in two-LTR circles formation was observed for theHIVQ168L virus after 24 h, while the HIVQ168A virusdisplayed normal levels. Because HIVQ168A made twice as much totalHIV cDNA as the WT virus, it was also 2-fold defective for two-LTR circles.The catalytic mutant D116A accumulated about 5 times more two-LTR circles thanthe WT virus, as described previously(31Limon A. Devroe E. Lu R. Ghory H.Z. Silver P.A. Engelman A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10598-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Finally, by quantifyingintegrated proviruses at 24 and 48 h post-infection, both HIVQ168Land HIVQ168A mutants were deficient for integration much like theD116A mutant (Fig.2D). These results show that the mutant virusHIVQ168A encoding a fully active integrase that does not interactwith LEDGF/p75 is specifically blocked at the integration step. These results suggest that the IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction is involved in themechanism controlling integration of the proviral DNA. In addition theysuggest that this interaction does not participate per se to thenuclear translocation of the PIC. LEDGF/p75 Tethers IN to Chromatin—We previouslyreported that in the absence of endogenous LEDGF/p75, nuclear localization ofIN was aborted (19Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. DeClercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J.Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33528-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar),suggesting a potential role of LEDGF/p75 in IN nuclear import. However, wealso noticed that silencing of endogenous LEDGF/p75 greatly decreased GFP-INexpression level in the nucleus(19Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. DeClercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J.Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33528-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Here we show thattreatment by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 restored a normal level of nuclearGFP-IN WT in cells that were silenced for LEDGF/p75 expression(Fig. 3). This suggests thatthe defect in nuclear accumulation of GFP-IN observed after transientsilencing of LEDGF/p75 expression could be an indirect consequence ofproteasome-dependent degradation of IN within the nucleus in the absence ofLEDGF/p75 expression. Using an in vitro nuclear import assay based ondigitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells(27Depienne C. Mousnier A. Leh H. Le Rouzic E. Dormont D. Benichou S. Dargemont C. J.

In addition, both Q168L and Q168A IN mutants fused to GFPaccumulated also in the nucleus even if some diffuse pattern is visible in thecytoplasm (Fig. 4B).This confirms that interaction with LEDGF/p75 does not seem to be required fornuclear import of IN. Alternatively, LEDGF/p75, which is known to be stronglyassociated with chromosomes in mitotic cells(19Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. DeClercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J.Biol.

Of note, the retention phenomenon seems particularly crucialwhen IN is not fused to GFP, since the Q168L IN-Flag mutant protein is morehomogeneously distributed between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartmentscompared with the WT IN-Flag or to the GFP-IN Q168L mutant(Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Interaction with LEDGF/p75 is not required for nuclear localization ofIN. A, knock-down of p75 by specific siRNA does not inhibit INnuclear import in vitro. HeLa cells transfected with p75-specific orcontrol (p75inv) siRNA, as indicated, were digitonin-permeabilizedand incubated with Cy3-labeled IN and an energy-regenerating system (ATP, GTP,creatine phosphate, and creatine phosphokinase). Cells were then fixed, andLEDGF/p75 expression was monitored by immunofluorescence staining, whereas INimport was visualized by direct fluorescence. B, mutation ofGln168 does not impair IN nuclear localization. HeLa cells weretransiently transfected with INs-FLAG or GFP-INsexpression vectors coding for the wild type or mutated Q168L, Q168A, and D116AIN, as indicated. Cells were then fixed, and IN localization was followed byan anti-IN antibody or alternatively by direct GFP fluorescence asindicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further analyze the role of LEDGF/p75 in the nuclear localization of IN,we studied the binding of the Q168L IN mutant fused to GFP to chromosomes inmitotic HeLa cells. While GFP-IN WT fully co-localized with chromosomal DNA inmitotic cells (Fig. 5),strikingly mutants GFP-IN Q168L and Q168A displayed a diffuse staining andwere no longer able to bind with condensed chromosomes(Fig. 5). In sharp contrast,the enzymatically inactive form of integrase, GFP-IN D116A, is still able tobind to mitotic chromosomes. From these experiments, we conclude thatLEDGF/p75 is not involved in active nuclear import of IN but rather directlytargets IN to the chromosomes of the host cell thereby influencing theretention of this protein in the nucleus. By a combination of multiple complementary approaches based on interactionstudies using random and directed mutagenesis, we could demonstrate thatinteraction of IN with LEDGF/p75 is important for integration and replicationof HIV-1. Our results show that LEDGF/p75 plays the role of a chromosomalligand allowing the binding of IN to the chromosomes and could be involved intargeting the HIV-1 PIC to favorable chromatin regions(6Bushman F.D. Cell. 2003; 115: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The LEDGF/p75 interacting domain maps within the core region of IN wherethe catalytic site is also located. Using two-hybrid screening, we found thatmutations of Gln168 of IN impaired LEDGF/p75 interaction. Althoughthe Q168A mutation that disrupts the IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction has no effect onthe catalytic activity of IN in vitro, the proximity of these twodomains could explain why, at least in vitro, LEDGF/p75 is able tomodulate and enhance the catalytic activity of IN(18Cherepanov P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48883-48892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Importantly, we foundthat the mutant Q168A was still catalytically active, although it wasdefective for tethering IN to cellular chromosomes. On the other hand, themutant D116A was still able to be targeted to chromosomes, although it wascatalytically dead. These results demonstrate that the tethering of IN to thechromosomes and the catalytic activity of integration are governed by twoindependent determinants in the protein. These results also underline theimportance of LEDGF/p75 function in targeting IN to cellular chromosomes, asan independent step prior to the enzymatic reaction that integrates theproviral cDNA into the host genome. However, one cannot rule out that, oncethe HIV-1 preintegration complex is targeted via LEDGF/p75 at the site ofintegration, LEDGF/p75 could also act as a cofactor for the enhancement of theenzymatic activity of HIV-1 integrase. Our results on the nuclear import of IN using either in vitronuclear import or GFP-IN fusion proteins indicate that LEDGF/p75 is notrequired for active nuclear import of IN. In infected cells, we observed a2-fold reduction of two-LTR circle formation (relative to the amount of totalHIV-1 cDNA), as well as an inhibition of integrated copies ofHIV-1Q168A and HIV-1Q168L. This phenotype is differentfrom that observed with the catalytic mutant of IN, which displayed a 5-foldincrease of two-LTR circles formation as well as inhibition of integratedforms (Fig. 2, B andC). LEDGF/p75 silencing led to proteasome-dependentdegradation of IN (Fig. 3).Furthermore, we observed a decrease in the half-life of IN Q168L and IN Q168Acompared with the WT protein, while IN D116A wasstable. 3D. Tempe., S. Emiliani, and R. Benarous, unpublished data. These datasuggest that by inhibiting its interaction with LEDGF/p75, IN becomes moreprone to degradation in the nucleus, leading to a decrease of the two-LTRcircles forms associated with preintegration complexes. Although we cannotrule out that the isolated IN and the PIC could display distinct karyophilicbehavior, our results show that HIV-1Q168L andHIV-1Q168A are predominantly blocked at the integration step,suggesting that IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction is not directly required forimporting the HIV-1 PIC in the nucleus. Maertens et al.(22Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. Engelman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33421-33429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) found that overexpressionof LEDGF/p75 mutated in the nuclear localization signal resulted in theaggregation of IN-LEDGF/p75 complexes in the cytoplasm. This is fullyconsistent with our own conclusions in favor of a role of LEDGF/p75 in thetargeting of IN to chromatin rather than in nuclear import. In fact,overexpression of a nuclear localization signal mutant of LEDGF/p75 excludedfrom the nucleus but still able to bind to IN will act as a transdominant,trapping IN in the cytoplasm, even if the nuclear import of IN is notcontrolled by interaction with LEDGF/p75. Surprisingly, it was recently reported that replication of HIV-1 in Jurkatcells silenced for LEDGF/p75 was not impaired, despite the fact that in theseconditions, integrase was found delocalized in the cytoplasm(21Llano M. Vanegas M. Fregoso O. Saenz D. Chung S. Peretz M. Poeschla E.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9524-9537Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). One cannot rule out thatthe functions of LEDGF/p75 in viral replication and chromosomal targeting ofIN could be redundant and that another protein could substitute for LEDGF/p75in certain cell types. Interestingly, it has been proposed that HRP2(hepatoma-derived growth factor protein 2), another hepatoma-derived growthfactor-related protein, is also able to interact with HIV-1 integrase andcould be a substitute for some of LEDGF/p75 functions(30Cherepanov P. Devroe E. Silver P.A. Engelman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48883-48892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, we havegenerated several cell lines stably depleted for LEDGF/p75, and we constantlyobserved a reduction of HIV-1 replication in the absence of LEDGF/p75 that wasrestored when the protein wasre-expressed. 4L. Vandekerckhove, F. Christ, M. Michiels, B. Van Maele, J. De Rijck, R.Gijsbers, C. Vandenhaute, and Z. Debyser, submitted for publication.Furthermore, as indicated above, we found that HIV-1Q168L andHIVQ168A viruses were also replication-defective in Jurkatcells. Two other mutations of IN impairing interaction with LEDGF/p75 wererecently described. The point mutation H12N in the zinc binding domain of INwas shown to reduce its affinity for LEDGF/p75 in vitro(19Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. DeClercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J.Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33528-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). V165A, another INmutant, was also shown to be defective for LEDGF/p75 interaction(9Turlure F. Devroe E. Silver P.A. Engelman A. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 3187-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A virus harboring theV165A mutation was replication-deficient(31Limon A. Devroe E. Lu R. Ghory H.Z. Silver P.A. Engelman A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10598-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Analysis of the INstructure shows that residues Val165 and Gln168 are inclose contact within the monomer. However, Val165 is partiallyburied within the protein, therefore less accessible for interaction withLEDGF/p75 than Gln168, which is exposed at the surface of theprotein. Altogether, these findings support the notion that LEDGF/p75 is animportant cofactor of HIV-1 integrase involved in its chromosomal targetingand required for integration and replication of HIV-1. Taking into account thefull defect in viral replication resulting from lack of interaction of IN withLEDGF/p75, one can postulate that a compound capable of disrupting orpreventing the interaction of IN with LEDGF/p75 would display a very potentanti-viral activity.

https://openalex.org/W2125841356,"Altered expression of apoptosis-regulating genes plays an important role in the aggressive growth behavior and chemoresistance of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In the present study, the hypoxia-inducible proapoptotic gene, BNIP3, was analysed in terms of expression, effect on patient survival and chemo-responsiveness in pancreatic cancer cell lines. cDNA microarray, real-time light cycler® quantitative polymerase chain reaction, laser-capture microdissection and immunohistochemistry analyses were used to evaluate BNIP3 expression in normal and diseased pancreatic specimens. Modulation of BNIP3 expression was achieved using specific siRNA molecules. The effect of chemotherapeutic agents on pancreatic cancer cells was assessed utilizing 3-(4,5-methylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium-bromide assays. BNIP3 mRNA levels were 3.0- and 6.3-fold lower in chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer compared to the normal pancreas, respectively. Microdissection analysis confirmed the reduction of BNIP3 expression in pancreatic cancer cells compared to normal duct cells. By immunohistochemistry, BNIP3 was predominantly expressed in the acinar cells of the normal and diseased pancreas. Interestingly, while BNIP3 was undetectable in the cancer cells of 59% of the cases, 75–100% of PanIN2/3 lesions displayed BNIP3 immunoreactivity. Loss of BNIP3 expression correlated with poorer survival of patients (8 vs 14 months for BNIP3 negative vs positive tumors). Hypoxia induced BNIP3 expression in four out of eight pancreatic cancer cell lines, while it was absent under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in the remaining four. Downregulation of BNIP3 resulted in increased resistance to 5-fluoro-uracil and gemcitabine. In conclusion, loss of BNIP3 expression occurs late in pancreatic cancer, contributes to resistance to chemotherapy and correlates with a worsened prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2008575015,"Adherens junctions (AJs) are a major cell-cell adhesion structure in epithelial cells that are formed by two major cell-cell adhesion molecules, E-cadherin and nectin. We have previously shown that nectin first forms cell-cell adhesion and then recruits non-trans-interacting E-cadherin to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites, which gradually trans-interact there, eventually forming AJs. We have examined here the effect of trans-interacting nectin on non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis. Trans-interacting nectin capable of associating with afadin, but not trans-interacting nectin mutant incapable of associating with afadin, inhibited non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis in intact cells. Afadin is a nectin- and actin filament-binding protein that connects nectin to the actin cytoskeleton. Studies on the mode of action of the nectin-afadin system using cell-free assay revealed that afadin associated with nectin bound Rap1 activated by trans-interacting nectin, interacted with p120ctn, and strengthened the binding of p120ctn to E-cadherin, eventually reducing non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis. Afadin, which did not bind Rap1, was inactive in this capacity. These results indicate that trans-interacting nectin inhibits non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis through afadin, Rap1, and p120ctn and thereby further accumulates non-trans-interacting E-cadherin to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites for the formation of AJs.

E-cadherin first forms cis-dimers on the cell surface of the same cells, followed by formation of trans-dimers (trans-interactions) on the cell surface of two neighboring cells, through the extracellular region in a Ca2+-dependent manner, eventually causing cell-cell adhesion (5Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar, 6Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar, 7Vleminckx K. Kemler R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic region is linked to the actin cytoskeleton through α- and β-catenins (8Aberle H. Schwartz H. Kemler R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), which strengthen the cell-cell adhesion activity of E-cadherin (4Gumbiner B.M. J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The definitive role of p120ctn remains unknown, but several lines of evidence for its role have been reported: Mutations of the p120ctn binding region of E-cadherin inhibit transport of de novo synthesized E-cadherin to the plasma membrane in L fibroblasts (12Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); knock down of p120ctn reduces cell surface E-cadherin, presumably by enhancing its endocytosis (13Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar); and p120ctn binds to kinesin and promotes cell surface trafficking of cadherins (14Chen X. Kojima S. Borisy G.G. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 15Yanagisawa M. Kaverina I.N. Wang A. Fujita Y. Reynolds A.B. Anastasiadis P.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 579: 9512-9521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Nectin is a recently emerged Ca2+-independent immunoglobulin (Ig)-like cell-cell adhesion molecule that forms AJs cooperatively with cadherin (16Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 17Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Nectin comprises a family of four members, nectin-1, -2, -3, and -4. Each member first forms homo-cis-dimers and then homo- or hetero-trans-dimers (trans-interactions) through the extracellular region in a Ca2+-independent manner, inducing cell-cell adhesion. The cytoplasmic region is associated with the actin cytoskeleton through afadin, a nectin- and actin filament-binding protein. Trans-interaction of nectin first forms cell-cell adhesion and then recruits cadherin to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites, eventually forming AJs. In epithelial cells, after the formation of AJs, tight junctions are formed at the apical side of AJs (18Tsukita S. Furuse M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 268-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). At tight junctions, claudin is a key cell-cell adhesion molecule (19Tsukita S. Furuse M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 915: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 20Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). In addition, trans-interaction of nectin induces activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins (17Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 21Shimizu K. Takai Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Trans-interaction of nectin first recruits and activates c-Src at the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites (22Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T. Yamada T. Ogita H. Okada M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Activated c-Src then tyrosine phosphorylates FRG, a specific GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42, FRG (FGD1-related GEF) and activates C3G, a Rap1-GEF, through Crk, an adaptor of c-Src, at the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites. Rap1 then enhances the GEF activity on Cdc42 of tyrosine-phosphorylated FRG (23Fukuyama T. Ogita H. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara T. Yamada T. Sato T. Shimizu K. Nakamura T. Matsuda M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 815-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Vav2 is recruited and tyrosine phosphorylated by c-Src at the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites (24Kawakatsu T. Ogita H. Fukuhara T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Shimizu K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4940-4947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cdc42 then enhances the GEF activity on Rac of the tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav2. Cdc42 activated in this way induces the formation of filopodia and increases the cell-cell contact sites, whereas Rac activated in this way induces the formation of lamellipodia, which efficiently expands the cell-cell adhesion between filopodia, acting like a “zipper” and eventually enhancing the formation of AJs (22Fukuhara T.

Hansen M.D.H. Nelson W.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Both Rac and Cdc42, but mainly Rac, are activated by trans-interaction of E-cadherin (26Yap A.S. Kovacs E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 27Izumi G. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Morimoto K. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), but the physiological role of this activation of Rac or Cdc42 remains unknown. When epithelial cells migrate in response to many extracellular signals, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/scatter factor and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, the cells first spread, followed by disruption of AJs and tight junctions and cell scattering. The disruption of AJs is always associated with E-cadherin endocytosis, but its molecular mechanism has not been fully understood (28Kamei T. Matozaki T. Sakisaka T. Kodama A. Yokoyama S. Peng Y.F. Nakano K. Takaishi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6776-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 29Fujita Y. Krause G. Scheffner M. Zechner D. Leddy H.E. Behrens J. Sommer T. Birchmeier W.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We have recently developed a new biochemical assay that efficiently reconstitutes the E-cadherin endocytosis, using an AJ-enriched plasma membrane fraction from rat liver (27Izumi G. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Morimoto K. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We have found by use of this cell-free assay that non-trans-interacting E-cadherin is constitutively endocytosed in a clathrin-dependent manner. Rac mainly activated by trans-interacting E-cadherin inhibits the E-cadherin endocytosis through IQGAP1 and actin filaments. Because IQGAP1 is an actin filament-cross-linking protein and a downstream target of Rac (31Kuroda S. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 32Bashour A.M. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29579-29583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), it is likely that IQGAP1 binds to Rac activated by trans-interacting E-cadherin and reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in inhibition of E-cadherin endocytosis and stabilization of E-cadherin on the plasma membrane. On the other hand, we have previously shown that nectin, but not E-cadherin, plays an important role in recruiting IQGAP1 to very primordial nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites through the actin cytoskeleton (34Katata T. Irie K. Fukuhara A. Kawakatsu T. Yamada A. Shimizu K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2097-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), in contrast to the previous observation that E-cadherin is required for the accumulation of IQGAP1 at AJs solely by binding to β-catenin (35Fukata M. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We have shown that Rac and Cdc42 activated by trans-interacting nectin also have potency to inhibit the E-cadherin endocytosis (27Izumi G. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Morimoto K. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Therefore, taken together, IQGAP1 would be first recruited through the actin cytoskeleton to the cell-cell adhesion sites where Rac and Cdc42 are activated by trans-interacting nectin. IQGAP1 bound to Rac and Cdc42 then induces reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. E-cadherin is then recruited to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites and induces the activation of Rac, which then facilitates the recruitment of IQGAP1 and the subsequent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. These sequential reorganizations of the actin cytoskeleton are likely to inhibit E-cadherin endocytosis on one hand and strengthen the cell-cell adhesion activity of E-cadherin on the other hand. In addition, we have recently found that trans-interacting full-length nectin-1 capable of associating with afadin inhibits the non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis more potently than trans-interacting nectin mutant incapable of associating with afadin. These results suggest that afadin is additionally involved in E-cadherin endocytosis. We studied here the role and mode of action of afadin in E-cadherin endocytosis. Expression vectors were constructed in pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) and pFastBac1-maltose-binding protein (MBP) using standard molecular biology methods. The pFastBac1-MBP was constructed with a baculovirus transfer vector, pFastBac1 (Invitrogen), to express an N-terminal MBP fusion protein. Constructs of afadin contained the following amino acids (aa): pEGFP-afadin, aa 1-1829; pEGFP-afadin-ΔRA, aa 352-1829; pFastBac1-MBP-afadin, aa 1-1829; and pFastBac1-MBP-afadin-ΔRA, aa 352-1829. The pIRM21-FLAG-V12Rap1B was provided by Dr. M. Matsuda (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). A rat anti-E-cadherin (extracellular portion) mAb (ECCD-2) was provided by Dr. M. Takeichi (Center for Developmental Biology, RIKEN, Kobe, Japan). A mouse anti-p120ctn mAb, a mouse anti-E-cadherin mAb (BD Transduction Laboratories), a rabbit anti-GFP pAb (MBL), a mouse anti-FLAG mAb (Sigma), and a rabbit anti-MBP pAb (New England BioLabs) were purchased from commercial sources. The assay was performed as described with minor modifications (36Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Briefly, after preincubation with IgG or Nef-3, EL cells, nectin-1-EL cells, and nectin-1-ΔC-EL cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-ss-biotin on ice, and the cells were incubated at 18 °C to allow the E-cadherin endocytosis for the indicated periods of time. The cells were incubated in several washes with a glutathione buffer (60 mm glutathione, 83 mm NaCl, 83 mm NaOH, and 10% bovine serum albumin) on ice to remove bound biotinyl groups from remaining cell surface-biotinylated proteins. The cells were then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, and 5 mm EDTA). The cell extracts were incubated with streptavidin beads (Sigma) to collect bound biotinylated proteins. Bound proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the anti-E-cadherin mAb. The blots were developed using the ECL kit and quantitated using a densitometer Fluorchem™ (Alpha Innotech). The assay was performed as described (27Izumi G. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Morimoto K. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, the AJ-enriched fraction was prepared from rat livers as described (37Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), washed with 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4) and 125 mm KOAc), and stored at -80 °C until use. The thawed AJ membrane fraction (20 μg of protein) was incubated at 30 °C in a reaction mixture (36 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sorbitol, 70 mm KOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm Mg(OAc)2, an ATP-regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 IU creatine phosphate kinase), 100 μm GTP, and 2.5 mg/ml rat brain cytosol). The reaction was stopped by chilling the tube on ice. The membrane was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The membrane was resuspended by trituration (20 times pipetting) in 50 μl of 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2) and 0.25 m sorbitol and then supplemented with KOAc and Mg(OAc)2 to final concentrations of 150 and 2.5 mm, respectively (final volume of 60.6 μl). Immediately after addition of KOAc and Mg(OAc)2, differential centrifugation was performed at medium speed (16,000 × g) for 2 min. The top 42-μl supernatant fraction was harvested and centrifuged at high speed (100,000 × g) for 20 min. Membrane pellets from the high speed spins were solubilized in an SDS sample buffer at room temperature for 30 min with vigorous shaking, and proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane sheets and immunoblotted with the anti-E-cadherin mAb, followed by the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were developed using the ECL kit and quantitated using a densitometer Fluorchem™ (Alpha Innotech). The thawed AJ membrane fraction (20 μg of protein) was incubated in a reaction mixture (36 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sorbitol, 70 mm KOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm Mg(OAc)2, an ATP-regenerating system, and 100 μm GTP) with or without MBP-afadin, MBP-afadin-ΔRA, and a mixture of MBP-afadin and Rap1B-GTPγS or Rap1B-GDPβS. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by chilling the tube on ice and the membrane was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant fraction and the membrane pellet fraction were solubilized in an SDS sample buffer at room temperature for 30 min with vigorous shaking, and proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane sheets and immunoblotted with the anti-p120ctn mAb and the anti-MBP pAb, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were developed using an ECL kit and quantitated using a densitometer Fluorchem™ (Alpha Innotech). To determine the amount of E-cadherin bound to p120ctn in EL cell lines, cells treated with Nef-3 were extracted by the addition of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (at pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μm α-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The extract was incubated with the anti-p120ctn mAb (20 μg) at 4 °C for 18 h. The immunocomplexes were then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in the SDS sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the anti-E-cadherin and anti-p120ctn mAbs. To determine the binding of afadin to p120ctn, HEK293 cells were transfected with pEGFP, pEGFP-afadin, pEGFP-afadin-ΔRA, or a mixture of pEGFP-afadin and pIRM21-FLAG-V12Rap1B using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After 48 h of incubation, the cells were extracted by the addition of Buffer A. The cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The extract was incubated with the anti-GFP pAb (5 μg) at 4 °C for 18 h. The immunocomplexes were then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads. After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in the SDS sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the anti-p120ctn mAb, the anti-GFP pAb, and the anti-FLAG mAb. MDCK cells (2 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C for 48 h and then transfected with pEGFP, pEGFP-afadin, pEGFP-afadin-ΔRA, or a mixture of pEGFP-afadin and pIRM21-FLAG-V12Rap1B using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. After 24 h of culture, the cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml HGF for 4 h. The cells were fixed, followed by immunostaining with the anti-E-cadherin mAb (ECCD-2). Images were captured using a Carl Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope using a ×63 oil immersion objective lens (model LSM 510-V3.2; Carl Zeiss). The fluorescence intensities of E-cadherin and afadin in MDCK cells were measured using the fluorescence intensity profile function of LSM 510 software. Collected data were exported as 8-bit TIFF files and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. The number of endocytosed E-cadherin-positive vesicular structures inside the cells was compared between the transfected and untransfected cells in the same field. Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was done as described by Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of the non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis by the nectin-afadin system, we first examined the effect of the trans- or non-trans-interacting full-length nectin-1 and the C-terminal 4-aa deletion mutant of nectin-1, which does not associate with afadin (nectin-1-ΔC), on non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis in intact cells. For this purpose, we first used L cells stably expressing nectin-1 and E-cadherin (nectin-1-EL cells), L cells stably expressing nectin-1-ΔC and E-cadherin (nectin-1-ΔC-EL cells), and L cells stably expressing E-cadherin (EL cells), because E-cadherin is constitutively endocytosed and recycled when cells do not contact other cells and E-cadherin does not trans-interact (27Izumi G. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Morimoto K. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 40Paterson A.D. Parton R.G. Ferguson C. Stow J.L. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21050-21057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We assayed at 18 °C to stop this recycling and to measure only the E-cadherin endocytosis in the absence or presence of an extracellular fragment of nectin-3 fused to the Fc portion of IgG (Nef-3), known to potently trans-interact with cellular nectin-1 in these cells. When these cells were cultured sparsely and did not contact each other in the absence of Nef-3, the amounts of endocytosed E-cadherin were similar among EL cells, nectin-1-EL cells, and nectin-1-ΔC-EL cells (Fig. 1A). In the presence of Nef-3, the amounts of endocytosed E-cadherin were reduced in nectin-1-EL cells and nectin-1-ΔC-EL cells, but not in EL cells (Fig. 1B). The amount of endocytosed E-cadherin in nectin-1-EL cells was less than that in nectin-1-ΔC-EL cells. Thus, trans-interacting nectin-1 inhibited the non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis more potently than trans-interacting nectin-1-ΔC. We have previously shown that activation of Rac and Cdc42 by trans-interacting full-length nectin inhibits non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis through the IQGAP1-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in nectin-1-EL cells (27Izumi G. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Morimoto K. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Association of the C-terminal 4 aa of nectin-1 with afadin is not required for this nectin-induced activation of Rac and Cdc42 in nectin-1-EL cells (41Kawakatsu T. Shimizu K. Honda T. Fukuhara T. Hoshino T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50749-50755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Taken together, in addition to the Rac- and Cdc42-induced inhibition of the non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis, these results suggest that association of the C-terminal 4 aa of nectin-1 with afadin is required for full inhibition of the non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis by trans-interacting full-length nectin-1 in nectin-1-EL cells. We have previously developed a cell-free assay using an AJ-enriched fraction from rat liver in which non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis is induced (27Izumi G. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Morimoto K. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the regulation of the activity of afadin on E-cadherin endocytosis, we examined whether afadin affects the non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis in this cell-free assay as schematically shown in Fig. 2A. Pure recombinant afadin did not affect the E-cadherin endocytosis, but an RA domain-deleted mutant of afadin, afadin-ΔRA, inhibited the E-cadherin endocytosis, suggesting that the RA domain is the negatively regulatory domain for the activity of afadin on E-cadherin endocytosis (Fig. 2B). Afadin binds the GTP-bound form of Rap1B preferentially to the GDP-bound form of Rap1B (42Linnemann T. Geyer M. Jaitner B.K. Block C. Kalbitzer H.R. Witting-hofer A. Herrmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13556-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The GTPγS-bound form of Rap1B enhanced the inhibitory activity of afadin on the E-cadherin endocytosis in a dose-dependent manner, similarly to that induced by afadin-ΔRA, whereas the GDPβS-bound form of Rap1B was less effective (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that afadin inhibits non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis in a Rap1-dependent manner. It is well established that p120ctn directly binds to the juxtamembrane region of E-cadherin, and it has been suggested that p120ctn is involved in the stabilization of non-trans-interacting E-cadherin on the cell surface (13Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 43Xiao K. Allison D.F. Buckley K.M. Kottke M.D. Vincent P.A. Faundez V. Kowalczyk A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the nectin-afadin system inhibits non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis through p120ctn in nectin-1-EL cells. When p120ctn was immunoprecipitated, E-cadherin was co-immunoprecipitated with p120ctn in EL, nectin-1-EL, and nectin-1-ΔC-EL cells (Fig. 3). However, the amount of E-cadherin co-immunoprecipitated with p120ctn in nectin-1-EL cells was much more than that in EL and nectin-1-ΔC-EL cells. The amounts of E-cadherin co-immunoprecipitated with p120ctn were similar between EL and nectin-1-ΔC-EL cells. These results indicate that nectin-1 stabilizes the association of p120ctn with E-cadherin through afadin and thereby inhibits non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis. We next examined whether afadin affects the binding of p120ctn to E-cadherin in a Rap1-dependent manner using the cell-free assay as schematically shown in Fig. 4A. p120ctn was released from the AJ membrane during the incubation. Pure recombinant afadin did not affect the release of p120ctn from the AJ membrane, but afadin-ΔRA inhibited the release of p120ctn from the AJ membrane in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that afadin-ΔRA enhances the stabilization of p120ctn on the AJ membrane (Fig. 4B). Afadin and afadin-ΔRA bound to the AJ membrane in a dose-dependent manner. Afadin-ΔRA bound to it ~3-fold more than afadin. The GTPγS-bound form of Rap1B enhanced the inhibitory activity of afadin on the release of p120ctn from the AJ membrane in a dose-dependent manner, similarly to that induced by afadin-ΔRA, whereas the GDPβS-bound form of Rap1B was less effective (Fig. 4C). Two immunoblot bands were reacted with the anti-p120ctn mAb in the supernatant fraction of the cell-free assay as shown in Fig. 4, B and C. Two major N-terminal splicing variants of p120ctn (120 and 100 kDa) have been reported to be expressed in various mouse tissues (44Montonen O. Aho M. Uitto J. Aho S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The anti-p120ctn mAb used here was raised against the C-terminal fragment of p120ctn and could react with both 120 and 100 kDa isoforms of p120ctn in the AJ fraction from rat liver and other tissues (supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, we assumed that the two bands were the 120 and 100 kDa isoforms of p120ctn. For quantification of immunoblot, we measured the intensity of both bands collectively. These results indicate that afadin inhibits the release of p120ctn from the AJ membrane in a Rap1-dependent manner. To examine the in vivo binding of afadin to p120ctn, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed using the HEK293 cell lysate. Afadin, a mixture of afadin and a constitutively active mutant of Rap1B (V12Rap1B: Rap1B-CA), or afadin-ΔRA was transiently overexpressed in HEK293 cells. When afadin was immunoprecipitated, endogenous p120ctn was co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 5). The amount of co-immunoprecipitated p120ctn was increased by co-expression with Rap1B-CA. Rap1B-CA indeed bound to afadin. The amount of co-immunoprecipitated p120ctn with afadin-ΔRA was more than that with afadin alone and similar to that with the mixture of afadin and Rap1B-CA. Thus, afadin forms a novel trimeric complex with p120ctn and Rap1. To confirm the direct binding of afadin to p120ctn, we performed affinity chromatography using the pure recombinant proteins of afadin and p120ctn. Afadin did not bind p120ctn directly, and this binding was not affected by binding of Rap1B-CA to afadin (data not shown). A modification or another protein(s) may be required for the efficient binding between afadin and p120ctn. Taken together, these results indicate that afadin binds p120ctn in intact cells and inhibits non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis through p120ctn in a Rap1-dependent manner. To further validate the results obtained in our assay systems, we finally examined whether afadin affects E-cadherin endocytosis in intact MDCK cells. Activation of c-Met, the cell surface receptor for HGF, enhances E-cadherin endocytosis (28Kamei T. Matozaki T. Sakisaka T. Kodama A. Yokoyama S. Peng Y.F. Nakano K. Takaishi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6776-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of afadin on the HGF-induced E-cadherin endocytosis in MDCK cells. Quantitative analysis showed that overexpression of both afadin and Rap1B-CA or afadin-ΔRA inhibited the HGF-induced E-cadherin endocytosis, consistent with our results in the cell-free assay (Fig. 6, A and B). Control GFP or afadin alone did not affect the HGF-induced E-cadherin endocytosis. X-Z optical sectioning showed that afadin co-expressed with Rap1B-CA and afadin-ΔRA was more highly concentrated at the cell-cell adhesion sites than afadin alone, consistent with our results in the cell-free assay shown in Fig. 4, B and C (Fig. 6, A and C). These results indicate that afadin inhibits the HGF-induced E-cadherin endocytosis in a Rap1-dependent manner in intact MDCK cells. We have previously shown that non-trans-interacting E-cadherin, but not the trans-interacting one, undergoes endocytosis and that Rac activated by the action of trans-interacting E-cadherin inhibits E-cadherin endocytosis through the IQGAP1-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which shifts the equilibrium from the cell-cell dissociation state to the cell-cell adhesion state (27Izumi G. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Morimoto K. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously shown that Rac and Cdc42 activated by trans-interacting nectin also have a potency to inhibit non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis through the IQGAP1-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (27Izumi G. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Morimoto K. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For this nectin-induced activation of Rac and Cdc42, the association of the C-terminal tail of nectin with afadin has been shown not to be required (41Kawakatsu T. Shimizu K. Honda T. Fukuhara T. Hoshino T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50749-50755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). On the other hand, for the efficient recruitment of E-cadherin to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites, the association of the C-terminal tail of nectin with afadin has been shown to be required (45Tachibana K. Nakanishi H. Mandai K. Ozaki K. Ikeda W. Yamamoto Y. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1161-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We have shown here that, in addition to the Rac and Cdc42-induced inhibition of non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis, the association of the C-terminal tail of nectin with afadin is required for full inhibition of non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis by trans-interacting full-length nectin. The inhibitory effect of afadin on the endocytosis is Rap1-dependent. Afadin enhances the binding of p120ctn to E-cadherin in a Rap1-dependent manner and thereby inhibits non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis. Moreover, we have recently shown that trans-interacting nectin induces the activation of Rap1 through c-Src/Crk/C3G signaling pathway (23Fukuyama T. Ogita H. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara T. Yamada T. Sato T. Shimizu K. Nakamura T. Matsuda M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 815-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Taken together, the trans-interacting nectin inhibits non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis by two pathways, the Rac and Cdc42-IQGAP1 pathway and the Rap1-afadin pathway. It has been shown that the Kd value for trans-interaction of E-cadherin is >100-fold higher than that for trans-interaction of nectin (46Koch A.W. Pokutta S. Lustig A. Engel J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7697-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 47Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Itoh S. Shingai T. Takekuni K. Satoh K. Inoue Y. Hamaguchi A. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). E-cadherin recruited to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites is, therefore, likely to be non-trans-interacting; as the concentration of non-trans-interacting E-cadherin increases, it gradually trans-interacts, eventually establishing AJs. Trans-interaction of nectin induces the activation of Rap1, which binds to afadin. The afadin-Rap1 complex then forms a novel trimeric complex with p120ctn and thereby enhances the binding of p120ctn to E-cadherin (Fig. 7). This binding prevents non-trans-interacting E-cadherin from endocytosis and stabilizes E-cadherin at the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites. The binding of Rap1 to afadin does not affect the association of nectin with afadin. 2W. Ikeda and Y. Takai, unpublished data. In cooperation with the Rap1-afadin-p120ctn-dependent regulation, trans-interacting nectin induces the activation of Cdc42 and Rac, which then inhibit non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis through IQGAP1-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and thereby accumulate non-trans-interacting E-cadherin at the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites. The recruited non-trans-interacting E-cadherin gradually start trans-interacting each other. Rac activated by the action of trans-interacting E-cadherin inhibits non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis through the IQGAP1-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and thereby enhances the accumulation of non-trans-interacting E-cadherin more and more at the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites. In these ways, trans-interacting nectin shifts the equilibrium from the non-trans-interaction state of E-cadherin to the trans-interaction state and thereby induces formation of the E-cadherin-based AJs. Moreover, Cdc42 activated by the action of trans-interacting nectin induces the formation of filopodia and increases the cell-cell contact sites, whereas Rac activated by the action of trans-interacting nectin induces the formation of lamellipodia, which efficiently expands the cell-cell adhesion between filopodia, acting like a “zipper.” Even after the formation of AJs by trans-interaction of E-cadherin, trans-interacting E-cadherin may dissociate to produce non-trans-interacting E-cadherin, but Cdc42 and Rac activated in these ways inhibit non-trans-interacting E-cadherin endocytosis. Thus, nectin plays important roles in the stabilization of E-cadherin on the plasma membrane and the formation and maintenance of AJs through afadin, the small G proteins, and p120ctn.

https://openalex.org/W2041563661,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a nonreceptor kinase that is overexpressed in many types of tumors and associates with multiple cell surface receptors and intracellular signaling proteins through which it can play an important role in survival signaling. A link between FAK and p53 in survival signaling has been reported, although the molecular basis of these events has not been described. In the present study, we report that FAK physically and specifically interacts with p53 as demonstrated by pull-down, immunoprecipitation, and co-localization analyses. Using different constructs of N-terminal, central, and C-terminal fragments of FAK and p53 proteins, we determined that the N-terminal fragment of FAK directly interacts with the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53. Inhibition of p53 with small interfering p53 RNA resulted in a decreased complex of FAK and p53 proteins in 293 cells, and induction of p53 with doxorubicin in normal human fibroblasts caused an increase of FAK and p53 interaction. Introduction of the FAK plasmid into p53-null SAOS-2 cells was able to rescue these cells from apoptosis induced by expression of wild type p53. In HCT 116 colon cancer cells, co-transfection of FAK plasmid with p21, MDM-2, and BAX luciferase plasmids resulted in significant inhibition of p53-responsive luciferase activities, demonstrating that FAK can reduce transcriptional activity of p53. The results of the FAK and p53 interaction study strongly support the conclusion that FAK can suppress p53-mediated apoptosis and inhibit transcriptional activity of p53. This provides a novel mechanism for FAK-p53-mediated survival/apoptotic signaling.

FAK mRNA levels have been shown to be increased in premalignant adenomatous tissues and invasive and metastatic tumors (7Weiner T.M. Liu E.T. Craven R.J. Cance W.G.

Recently, real time PCR analysis of matched samples of normal colon mucosa, colorectal carcinoma, and liver metastases demonstrated increased FAK mRNA and protein levels in tumor and metastatic tissues versus normal tissues (16Lark A.L. Livasy C.A. Calvo B. Caskey L. Moore D.T. Yang X. Cance W.G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 215-222PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning and characterization of the FAK promoter demonstrated NF-κB and p53 transcription factor binding sites that had potential importance for regulation of FAK transcription (17Golubovskaya V. Kaur A. Cance W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1678: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). FAK was originally isolated as a tyrosine phosphorylated protein in v-Src-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts (1Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc.

The structure of the FAK protein includes a N-terminal domain with a primary autophosphorylation site, tyrosine 397, that directly interacts with the Src homology 2 domain (19Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) and PI-3 kinase (2Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), a central catalytic domain with two major sites of phosphorylation, Tyr-576/577, and a C-terminal domain containing two proline-rich segments and a focal adhesion-targeting subdomain that binds paxillin, talin, and other proteins (2Hanks S.K.

Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of FAK associates with the epidermal growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (21Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Ilic D. Klingbeil C.K. Schaefer E. Damsky C.H.

Recently, the N-terminal domain of FAK had been demonstrated in a complex with a protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1) (25Kadare G. Toutant M. Formstecher E. Corvol J.C. Carnaud M.

PIAS1 caused sumoylation of FAK and increased its autophosphorylation activity, suggesting a novel FAK role in signaling between the plasma membrane and the nucleus (25Kadare G. Toutant M.

The C-terminal noncatalytic domain of FAK, FAK-related nonkinase (p41/p43), is autonomously expressed in chicken embryo cells (26Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), initiated from an alternative promoter and start site residing within an intron (27Nolan K. Lacoste J. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6120-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Expression of FAK-related nonkinase caused dephosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397 (28Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and blocked FAK-mediated fibroblast migration (29Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In human cells, we have shown that an analogous C-terminal FAK fragment construct that we call FAK-CD can also regulate FAK function (14Xu L.H. Yang X. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 999-1005PubMed Google Scholar, 30Xu L. Yang X. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Baldwin A.S. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. J. Biol.

Inhibition of FAK expression with anti-sense oligonucleotides to FAK or overexpression of the FAK C-terminal domain led to cell rounding, detachment, reduction of invasion, and apoptosis (20Hildebrand J.D.

Craven R.J. Cance W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30597-30604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and anoikis (detachment-induced apoptosis) of epithelial cells (36Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar), suggesting that one function of FAK is to promote survival in cells subjected to apoptotic signals. Consistent with this hypothesis, constitutively active forms of FAK prevented anoikis and stimulated transformation of epithelial cells, resulting in anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in nude mice (36Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The functional link between FAK and tumor suppressor gene p53 was reported first by Ilic et al. (33Ilic D. Almeida E.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The authors demonstrated that p53 controls survival signals from the extracellular matrix transduced by FAK in anchorage-dependent cells (33Ilic D. Almeida E.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Recently, a link between p53-mediated anoikis and FAK was demonstrated in squamous cell carcinoma cells (37Zhang Y. Lu H. Dazin P. Kapila Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; Google Scholar). In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of 115 endometrial carcinoma samples demonstrated a correlation between FAK and p53 overexpression (38Livasy C.A. Moore D. Cance W.G. Lininger R.A. Appl. Immunohistochem. Mol. Morphol. 2004; 12: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of the p53-FAK-mediated role in anoikis and tumorigenesis has not been described. We have based our current study on the indirect link of FAK and p53 that has been reported (17Golubovskaya V. Kaur A. Cance W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1678: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 33Ilic D. Almeida E.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 37Zhang Y. Lu H. Dazin P. Kapila Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; Google Scholar, 38Livasy C.A. Moore D. Cance W.G. Lininger R.A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 10484-10490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that FAK directly and physically interacts with p53 in vitro and in vivo. We performed mapping analysis and have shown that the FAK-N-terminal domain binds the transactivation domain of p53. Binding of FAK and p53 was shown in different 293, HCT116, and BT474 cancer cell lines and in normal human fibroblasts. In addition, knockdown of p53 expression in 293 cells, treated with small interfering p53 siRNA, caused decreased binding of FAK and p53 proteins. In contrast, increased expression of p53 with doxorubicin treatment resulted in elevation of the FAK-p53 complex in normal human fibroblasts. In addition, we have shown that overexpression of FAK inhibited p53-induced apoptosis in SAOS-2 cells and decreased p53-mediated activation of p21 and MDM-2 luciferase constructs in HCT116 p53+/+ cells. Moreover, co-expression of FAK with p53 in p53-deficient HCT116 p53-/- and p53-null SAOS-2 cells significantly inhibited p53-mediated activation of a BAX-luciferase reporter. Thus, these studies strongly support a survival function of FAK and demonstrate that the FAK and p53 interaction can affect p53 transcriptional and apoptotic activity and play role in cancer cell survival signaling.

Samples were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic fractions. Pellets containing cell nuclei were washed once with hypotonic buffer and then extracted with high salt lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.025% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin), followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was the nuclear fraction. Equal protein amounts were loaded on the Ready SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and used for Western blot analysis with anti-FAK, anti-p53, anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (cytoplasmic fraction marker) and anti-histone H3 (nuclear fraction marker) antibodies. Expression of Recombinant GST Fusion Proteins—GST fusion proteins containing different domains of FAK and p53 were engineered by PCR. The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli bacteria by incubation with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were lysed by sonication, and the fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-agarose beads. The purified human FAK-NT protein was isolated from FAK-NT-GST fusion protein by thrombin cleavage according to manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Expression and Isolation of Baculovirus-expressed Proteins—PFastBac HT donor plasmids with the full-length FAK and PYK-2 cDNA were transformed into DH10Bac competent cells (Invitrogen). After transformation and transposition of the FAK DNA and PYK-2 DNA into a bacmid DNA, colonies containing recombinant bacmids were identified by disruption of the LacZ gene inside the bacmid DNA. The isolated recombinant bacmid DNAs from white LacZ- colonies were used for transfection of Sf9 insect cells. After three rounds of viral amplification, a recombinant FAK baculovirus and a PYK-2 baculovirus with a high titer (>1 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml) were used for infection of High Five insect cells (Invitrogen). The His6-tagged FAK and PYK-2 full-length proteins were isolated from High five, H5 insect cells with the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system buffers on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen Inc.) columns following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen Inc.). In brief, High five insect cell extract pellets were resuspended in the lysis buffer, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C. After centrifugation step, the supernatants were loaded on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column, pre-equilibrated with the washing buffer, containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol. After washing steps, the proteins were eluted with the buffer, containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm KCl, 100 mm imidazole, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol at 4 °C. The collected proteins were purified with slide-A-Lyzer 7K dialysis Cassettes (Pierce) in 1× PBS for 24 h at 4 °C. Isolated His-tagged FAK and PYK-2 proteins were analyzed by Western blot with anti-His and anti-FAK and anti"
https://openalex.org/W2034375425,"Originally characterized as a growth factor for erythrocytes, erythropoietin (EPO) is used to treat anemia and fatigue in cancer patients receiving radiation therapy and chemotherapy. EPO and the EPO receptor (EPOR) are expressed in nonhematopoietic cells and cancers. However, the role of EPO and EPOR within nonhematopoietic cancer cells remains incompletely understood. Although a recent clinical trial demonstrated worse tumor control and survival in head and neck cancer patients treated with EPO, the role of EPO and EPOR in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has not been examined. In the present study, we demonstrate the previously unrecognized EPO-mediated invasion by HNSCC cells through the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. Furthermore, we confirmed the expression of EPO and EPOR in a panel of human HNSCC cell lines and tissue specimens. Pharmacological doses of EPO also had a limited proliferation effect in these cell lines. These results define a novel role for EPO in mediating tumor cell invasion. Increased levels of EPO and EPOR in lymph node metastases as compared to primary tumors from HNSCC patients further support the role of EPO/EPOR in HNSCC disease progression and metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2058683340,"Dicamba O-demethylase is a multicomponent enzyme from Pseudomonas maltophilia, strain DI-6, that catalyzes the conversion of the widely used herbicide dicamba (2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid) to DCSA (3,6-dichlorosalicylic acid). We recently described the biochemical characteristics of the three components of this enzyme (i.e. reductaseDIC, ferredoxinDIC, and oxygenaseDIC) and classified the oxygenase component of dicamba O-demethylase as a member of the Rieske non-heme iron family of oxygenases. In the current study, we used N-terminal and internal amino acid sequence information from the purified proteins to clone the genes that encode dicamba O-demethylase. Two reductase genes (ddmA1 and ddmA2) with predicted amino acid sequences of 408 and 409 residues were identified. The open reading frames encode 43.7- and 43.9-kDa proteins that are 99.3% identical to each other and homologous to members of the FAD-dependent pyridine nucleotide reductase family. The ferredoxin coding sequence (ddmB) specifies an 11.4-kDa protein composed of 105 residues with similarity to the adrenodoxin family of [2Fe-2S] bacterial ferredoxins. The oxygenase gene (ddmC) encodes a 37.3-kDa protein composed of 339 amino acids that is homologous to members of the Phthalate family of Rieske non-heme iron oxygenases that function as monooxygenases. Southern analysis localized the oxygenase gene to a megaplasmid in cells of P. maltophilia. Mixtures of the three highly purified recombinant dicamba O-demethylase components overexpressed in Escherichia coli converted dicamba to DCSA with an efficiency similar to that of the native enzyme, suggesting that all of the components required for optimal enzymatic activity have been identified. Computer modeling suggests that oxygenaseDIC has strong similarities with the core αsubunits of naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase.

Nonetheless, the present studies point to dicamba O-demethylase as an enzyme system with its own unique combination of characteristics. The herbicide dicamba (2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid) has been used to effectively control broadleaf weeds in crops such as corn and wheat for almost 40 years. Like a number of other chlorinated organic compounds, dicamba does not persist in the soil because it is efficiently metabolized by a consortium of soil bacteria under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (1Smith A.E. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1973; 21: 708-710Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar—4Fogarty A.M. Tuovinen O.H. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1995; 14: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Studies with different soil types treated with dicamba have demonstrated that 3,6-dichlorosalicylic acid (DCSA), 1The abbreviations used are: DCSA, 3,6-dichlorosalicylic acid; DIC, dicamba; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; DIG, digoxigenin; ORF, open reading frame. 1The abbreviations used are: DCSA, 3,6-dichlorosalicylic acid; DIC, dicamba; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; DIG, digoxigenin; ORF, open reading frame. a compound without herbicidal activity, is a major product of the microbial degradation process (2Kreuger J.P.

Soil samples taken from a single site exposed to dicamba for several years yielded a number of bacterial species capable of utilizing dicamba as a sole carbon source (6Krueger J.P. Butz R.G. Atallah Y.H. Cork D.J. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1989; 37: 534-538Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These soil microorganisms could completely mineralize dicamba to carbon dioxide, water, and chloride ion (7Cork D.J. Kreuger J.P. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1991; 36: 1-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Studies on the metabolism of dicamba in the cells of one of these bacteria, the DI-6 strain of Pseudomonas maltophilia, showed that DCSA is a major degradation product (7Cork D.J. Kreuger J.P. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1991; 36: 1-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Yang J. Wang X-Z. Hage D.S. Herman P.L. Weeks D.P. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have been investigating dicamba O-demethylase, the enzyme involved in the first step of the dicamba degradation pathway in P. maltophilia, strain DI-6. We previously demonstrated that cell lysates contain an O-demethylase that catalyzes the rapid conversion of dicamba to DCSA (9Wang X-Z. Li B. Herman P.L. Weeks D.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1623-1626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also partially purified the enzyme and found that at least three separate components are required for activity (9Wang X-Z. Li B. Herman P.L. Weeks D.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1623-1626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we provided a detailed description of the purification and characterization of the reductaseDIC, ferredoxinDIC, and oxygenaseDIC components of dicamba O-demethylase (10Chakraborty S. Behrens M. Herman P.L. Arendsen A.F. Hagen W.R. Carlson D.L. Wang X-Z. Weeks D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 437: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). OxygenaseDIC is a homotrimer (α)3 with a subunit molecular mass of ∼40 kDa and contains a single Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster. FerredoxinDIC is a monomer with an estimated molecular mass of 14 kDa and has a single [2Fe-2S] cluster resembling those found in adrenodoxin and putidaredoxin. ReductaseDIC, a monomer with a molecular mass of ∼45 kDa, has the typical yellow color and UV fluorescence indicative of a flavin-containing molecule. All of the biochemical and physical data suggest that oxygenaseDIC can be classified as a member of the family of Rieske non-heme iron oxygenases (11Gibson D.T. Parales R.E. Curr. Opin. Biotech. 2000; 11: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In the present study, we describe the cloning and characterization of the genes (designated as ddmA, ddmB, and ddmC) that encode the three components of dicamba O-demethylase from P. maltophilia, strain DI-6. We demonstrate by Southern analysis that the oxygenase gene (ddmC) can be localized to a megaplasmid in cells of P. maltophilia. Finally, we describe overexpression of each of the cloned genes in a heterologous system and demonstrate that the three purified recombinant components can be reconstituted into an active enzyme that can convert dicamba to DCSA with an efficiency similar to that observed for the native enzyme under our assay conditions. Bacterial Strain and Culture Medium—P. maltophilia, strain DI-6, was originally isolated from a soil sample collected near a storm water retention pond at a dicamba manufacturing plant in Beaumont, TX (6Krueger J.P. Butz R.G. Atallah Y.H. Cork D.J. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1989; 37: 534-538Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in reduced chloride medium (6Krueger J.P. Butz R.G. Atallah Y.H. Cork D.J. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1989; 37: 534-538Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) amended with either filter-sterilized 5 mm dicamba or with autoclaved glucose (2 mg/ml) and casamino acids (2 mg/ml) as the carbon source. Solidified medium was prepared with 1% (w/v) Gelrite. Materials—Dicamba was a generous gift from Sandoz Agro Inc. (Des Plaines, IL). The custom oligonucleotide primers utilized in this study were commercially synthesized by Operon (Alameda, CA) and are listed in Table I.Table IAmino acid sequences, PCR primers, and oligonucleotide used in the cloning of the genes encoding the three components of dicamba O-demethylase The sequence of the degenerate nested PCR primers and oligonucleotide was based on the underlined amino acid residues.ComponentSequenceReductaseN-terminalSKADVVIVGAGHGGAQ (C) AIALQNInternalLYIRPPTFWANested PCR primersA5′–AARGCNGAYGTNGTNAT–3′B5′–ATHGTNGGNGCNGGNCA–3′C5′–GTNGGNGGNCKDATRTA–3′PCR primers (probe)5′–GGGCATGGCGGTGCACA–3′5′–AGGCGGTCGAAGGTCTT–3′FerredoxinN-terminalPQITVVNQSGEESSVEASEGRTLMEVIRDConsensusRL (T/S/C) CQ (V/I/L)Nested PCR primersA5′–ATHACNGTNGTNAAYCA–3′B5′–ATGGARGTNATHMGNGA–3′C5′–ANYTGRCANSWNARNCG–3′PCR primers (probe)5′–ATGGAGGTTATTCGCGACA–3′5′–GCTGTCGAGCAGGTCGTTC–3′OxygenaseN-terminalTFVRNAWYVAALPEELSEKPLGRTILDOligonucleotide (probe)5′–AAYGCNTGGTAYGTSGC–3′ Open table in a new tab Isolation of Genomic DNA—Genomic DNA was isolated from P. maltophilia according to a protocol modified from a method used for Synechococcus 6301 in the laboratory of Donald Bryant at Penn State University. 2D. Bryant, personal communication. Cells were grown in 500 ml of reduced chloride medium with glucose and casamino acids at 30 °C to an A600 of 1.5–2.0 and harvested by centrifugation at 9,110 × g for 20 min. The cells in the pellet were resuspended in sucrose buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose), incubated with lysozyme (5 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, and then lysed in 1% Sarkosyl. The lysate was centrifuged to equilibrium in a CsCl-ethidium bromide gradient in a Type 90 Ti rotor (Beckman) at 214,200 × g for 72 h at 20 °C. The fraction containing the genomic DNA was extracted with n-butanol and precipitated with 0.3 m sodium acetate and ethanol. Isolation of Megaplasmid DNA—Cells of P. maltophilia were grown in 500 ml of reduced chloride medium with 5 mm dicamba for ∼48 h at 30 °C with shaking (225 rpm). At this point, it was necessary to replace the culture medium because a metabolic by-product that interferes with cell growth typically accumulates in cultures of P. maltophilia grown with dicamba as the sole carbon source. The culture was centrifuged under sterile conditions at 5,000 × g for 10 min and then the pellet was resuspended in 500 ml of fresh or reduced chloride medium with 5 mm dicamba. The culture was grown for another 72 h under the same conditions and then plasmid DNA was isolated from the cells with a Qiagen-tip 100 according to a protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen) for the purification of very low-copy plasmids. Amino Acid Sequencing—The purification of the reductaseDIC, ferredoxinDIC, and oxygenaseDIC components of dicamba O-demethylase as well as the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the purified proteins have been described (10Chakraborty S. Behrens M. Herman P.L. Arendsen A.F. Hagen W.R. Carlson D.L. Wang X-Z. Weeks D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 437: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To obtain internal amino acid sequence information, the purified ferredoxinDIC and reductaseDIC proteins were digested with trypsin and the isolated peptide fragments were sequenced by automated Edman degradation in the Protein Core Facility (Center for Biotechnology, University of Nebraska-Lincoln). PCR Amplification and Cloning—A PerkinElmer DNA Thermal Cycler (model 480) programmed with the following profile was used for most PCR reactions: 97 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 7 min. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) typically contained 5 μl of 10 times buffer (Invitrogen), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 μm dNTPs, 100 pmol of each primer, 10–100 ng of template DNA, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). Pfu polymerase (2.5 units) (Stratagene) was used in PCR in which new restriction sites were added to the gene coding regions to facilitate cloning into a pET expression vector. Amplified products were ligated into the vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega) or pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) and the mixture was transformed into competent Escherichia coli DH5α cells. Plasmid DNA was isolated from selected bacterial colonies with a QIA-prep Spin Miniprep kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Clones were screened using standard molecular techniques that included appropriate restriction digests and agarose gel electrophoresis (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Both strands of selected clones were sequenced by the Genomics Core Research Facility (Center for Biotechnology, University of Nebraska-Lincoln) using standard sequencing primers. Preparation and Screening of Size-fractionated Genomic Libraries— Genomic DNA from P. maltophilia (at least 10 μg) was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and resolved on a 1% agarose gel using standard molecular techniques (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Gel pieces containing restriction fragments of the desired size were excised and digested with β-agarase according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). The DNA fragments eluted from the gel were ligated into the vector pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) and the mixture was transformed into competent E. coli DH5α cells. Colony lifts were prepared from each library and the bacterial clones were screened with gene-specific digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probes as described below. Plasmid DNA from positive bacterial colonies was isolated, characterized, and sequenced as described in the preceding section. Southern Blots, and Colony Lifts, and Probes—Blots and colony lifts were prepared and hybridized with probes labeled with DIG according to the standard protocols in the DIG Application Manual (Roche). Double-stranded DNA probes were labeled with DIG-11-dUTP using either a standard PCR or a random primed method detailed in the DIG Application Manual. Oligonucleotide probes were labeled with a DIG Oligonucleotide 3′-end Labeling Kit (Roche). Nylon filters were always washed under very stringent conditions after hybridization, that is, twice for 10 min at 65 °C in 2× SSC with 0.1% SDS and then twice for 20 min at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS. DIG-labeled DNA was detected by the chemiluminescent substrate CSPD according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Roche). Cloning of the Reductase Genes—The first 23 residues of the N-terminal sequence was determined for the purified reductaseDIC protein (Table I) as described previously (10Chakraborty S. Behrens M. Herman P.L. Arendsen A.F. Hagen W.R. Carlson D.L. Wang X-Z. Weeks D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 437: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A comparison of this sequence to the GenBank™ data base showed that it was 90% identical in a 20- amino acid overlap to the cytochrome P450-type reductase component of dioxin dioxygenase, a three-component enzyme previously isolated from Sphingomonas sp. RW1 (13Armengaud J. Timmis K.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An internal sequence of 10 residues obtained from tryptic digests of the purified reductaseDIC protein also was 80% identical to residues 61 through 70 of the same Sphingomonas reductase. This sequence information was used to clone the reductase gene by a two-step nested PCR approach. Three degenerate oligonucleotide primers (two sense and one antisense) were designed and synthesized (Table I). The sequence of the two sense primers was based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified reductaseDIC. Primer A (17-mer, 256 variants) was based on the sequence KADVVI and primer B (17-mer, 768 variants) was derived from the sequence IVGAGH. The sequence of the antisense primer C (17-mer, 768 variants) was based on the internal sequence YIRPPTF. Primers A and C were used in a PCR with P. maltophilia genomic DNA as template. An aliquot containing a mixture of the products from the first PCR was then used as the template in a second round of amplification with primers B and C. A 180-bp product was amplified in the second PCR and sequenced. The amino acid sequence predicted by this clone matched the N-terminal and internal sequence from the purified redutaseDIC protein. New sense and antisense primers based on the DNA sequence of the clone were designed (Table I) and a 148-bp probe was labeled in a PCR. The DIG-labeled probe consistently detected two fragments of different sizes when it was hybridized at 68 °C under very stringent conditions to several restriction digests of P. maltophilia genomic DNA that had been blotted to a nylon membrane (data not shown). This result suggested that there are two reductase genes located at different loci in the genome of P. maltophilia. A map of the restriction sites surrounding the reductase genes was constructed based on the sizes of the various restriction fragments that hybridized to the probe. This restriction map suggested that full-length copies of the two reductase genes were contained on 4- and 20-kb KpnI/EcoRI fragments. To clone the first gene, a size-fractionated genomic library containing 3.0–5.0-kb KpnI/EcoRI fragments was constructed and colony lifts were prepared. The 148-bp reductase probe was hybridized to ∼200 bacterial clones from the library at 68 °C and one positive clone was selected. To clone the second gene, KpnI/EcoRI fragments of P. maltophilia genomic DNA with a size of 15–25 kb were gel purified, digested with a number of restriction enzymes, and then hybridized by Southern blot to the same reductase probe. A second restriction map, constructed according to the sizes of restriction fragments that hybridized to the probe, suggested that a full-length reductase gene was contained on a 3.0-kb ApaI fragment. Subsequently, a size-fractionated genomic library containing 2.0–4.0-kb ApaI fragments was constructed and colony lifts were prepared. The reductase probe was hybridized to ∼200 bacterial clones from the library at 68 °C and one positive clone was selected. Cloning of the Ferredoxin Gene—The first 29 residues of the N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined for the purified ferredoxinDIC protein (Table I) as described previously (10Chakraborty S. Behrens M. Herman P.L. Arendsen A.F. Hagen W.R. Carlson D.L. Wang X-Z. Weeks D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 437: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A comparison of this sequence to the GenBank data base showed that it was 35% identical in a 26-amino acid overlap to a terpredoxin from a Pseudomonas species, a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin in the adrenodoxin family (14Peterson J.A. Lu J.-Y. Geisselsoder J. Graham-Lorence S. Carmona C. Witney F. Lorence M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14193-14203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence information was used to clone the ferredoxin gene by a two-step nested PCR approach. Three degenerate oligonucleotide primers (two sense and one antisense) were designed and synthesized (Table I). The sequence of the two sense primers was based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence from the purified ferredoxinDIC. Primer A (17-mer, 384 variants) was based on the sequence ITVVNQ and primer B (17-mer, 192 variants) was derived from the sequence MEVIRD. The sequence of the antisense primer C (17-mer, 8192 variants) was based on the amino acid sequence RL(T/S/C)CQ(V/I/L) that was part of the conserved [2Fe-2S] domain near the C-terminal end of six previously sequenced bacterial adrenodoxin-type ferredoxins (see Fig. 2). Primers A and C were used in a PCR with P. maltophilia genomic DNA as template. An aliquot containing a mixture of the products from the first PCR was then used as the template in a second round of amplification with primers B and C. A 191-bp product was amplified in the second PCR and sequenced. The amino acid sequence predicted by this clone matched the N-terminal and internal sequence obtained from the purified ferredoxinDIC protein. New sense and antisense primers based on the DNA sequence of the clone were designed (Table I) and a 149-bp probe was labeled in a PCR. The DIG-labeled probe was hybridized at 68 °C to P. maltophilia genomic DNA that had been digested with several restriction enzymes and blotted to a nylon membrane. A map of the restriction sites surrounding the ferredoxin gene was constructed based on the sizes of various restriction fragments that hybridized to the probe. This restriction map suggested that a full-length ferredoxin gene was contained on a 1.0-kb XhoI/PstI fragment. A size-fractionated genomic library containing 0.5–1.5-kb XhoI/PstI fragments was constructed and colony lifts were prepared. The 149-bp probe was hybridized to ∼200 bacterial clones from the library at 68 °C and one positive clone was selected. Cloning of the Oxygenase Gene—The first 27 residues of the N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined for the purified oxygenaseDIC protein (Table I) as described previously (10Chakraborty S. Behrens M. Herman P.L. Arendsen A.F. Hagen W.R. Carlson D.L. Wang X-Z. Weeks D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 437: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To clone the oxygenase gene, a degenerate oligonucleotide (17-mer, 32 variants) based on the sequence NAWYVA (Table I) was designed and synthesized. Genomic DNA from P. maltophilia was digested with several restriction enzymes, resolved on a 1% agarose gel, and blotted to a nylon membrane. The labeled oligonucleotide mixture was hybridized to the DNA on the blot at temperatures ranging from 35 to 60 °C. At 45 °C, the probe detected a single 3.5-kb XhoI/SstII fragment. A size-fractionated genomic library containing 3.0–4.0-kb XhoI/SstII fragments was constructed and colony lifts were prepared. The oligo probe was hybridized to ∼200 bacterial clones from the library at 45 °C and one positive clone was selected. Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis—A purified plasmid preparation from P. maltophilia was resolved on a 0.7% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer by pulsed field gel electrophoresis using a CHEF-DR III system (Bio-Rad). The apparatus was run at 6 V for 10 h with an initial switch time of 2 s and a final switch time of 2 s. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml water) to visualize the plasmid DNA and then blotted to a nylon filter. Sizes of megaplasmid DNAs were estimated relative to two sets of linear DNA markers. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—A set of sense and antisense primers was designed for each of the cloned genes to introduce an NcoI restriction site at the 5′ end and an XhoI restriction site at the 3′ end of the coding sequence. Each primer pair was used in a PCR with Pfu polymerase and the appropriate genomic clone as template. The amplified products were digested with NcoI and XhoI and then ligated into a pET expression vector (Novagen) that had been digested with the same restriction enzymes. The ferredoxin (ddmB) and the reductase (ddmA1) genes were cloned into the pET 30b(+) vector and the oxygenase gene (ddmC) was cloned into the pET 32b(+) vector. The constructs were sequenced to verify that the coding sequence of each gene was in-frame with the vector sequence that encodes a N-terminal His6 tag and then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). Recombinant proteins were expressed according to protocols in the pET system manual (Novagen). Cells transformed with the ferredoxin and reductase constructs were grown in 500 ml of LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C with shaking, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the A600 reached 0.6, and then grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Cells transformed with the oxygenase construct were grown in 500 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (75 μg/ml) at 37 °C with shaking, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the A600 reached 0.6, and then grown at 15 °C for an additional 24 h. The recombinant proteins were purified on a nickel ion-charged affinity column (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Fractions from the column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Assay of Dicamba O-Demethylase Activity—Fractions containing the purified native or recombinant reductase, ferredoxin, and oxygenase proteins were combined in a standard reaction mixture (9Wang X-Z. Li B. Herman P.L. Weeks D.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1623-1626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that was assayed for enzymatic activity by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to monitor the appearance of the DCSA reaction product (10Chakraborty S. Behrens M. Herman P.L. Arendsen A.F. Hagen W.R. Carlson D.L. Wang X-Z. Weeks D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 437: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 10 min in a total volume of 500 μl. Assays were initiated by addition of dicamba after a 5-min preincubation at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 80 μl of 5% sulfuric acid. Samples were centrifuged, filtered, and 250 μl of each sample was then injected into a C-18 reverse phase μBondapack 4.6 × 150-mm column. The product mixture was separated using a linear gradient of 60 to 0% methanol in 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.2) using a Waters HPLC unit. DCSA retention time was determined to be 14.1 min (established using 250 μl of 500 mm DCSA as a standard). Set concentrations of DCSA were used as quantitation standards. For kinetic studies, DCSA in reaction samples was detected and quantified by fluorescence emission at 420 nm (excitation wavelength, 310 nm) after separation from other reaction products by reverse-phase HPLC. Enzymatic activity in fractions containing the particular component being purified was assayed in the presence of excess quantities of the other two components of dicamba O-demethylase, 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 0.5 mm NADH, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 0.5 mm ferrous sulfate, and 0.5 mm dicamba. Cloning of the Reductase Genes—A 148-bp reductase probe was generated by a two-step nested PCR approach described under “Experimental Procedures“ and used to screen two E. coli size-fractionated genomic libraries of P. maltophilia, strain DI-6. Two genes (ddmA1 and ddmA2), both of which encode the reductase component of dicamba O-demethylase, were identified. Sequence analysis showed that a 4.3-kb KpnI/EcoRI fragment that hybridized to the probe contained a 1224-bp open reading frame (ORF) preceded by Shine-Dalgarno (ribosome binding site) sequence GGGAAAA positioned 11 bases upstream from the initiation codon (data not shown). The ORF encoded a 43.7-kDa protein consisting of 408 amino acids (Fig. 1), a size that was consistent with the molecular mass of 45 kDa that was previously estimated for purified reductaseDIC by SDS-PAGE (10Chakraborty S. Behrens M. Herman P.L. Arendsen A.F. Hagen W.R. Carlson D.L. Wang X-Z. Weeks D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 437: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence specified by the ddmA1 gene matched the N-terminal and internal amino acid sequence information previously obtained from purified reductaseDIC. The protein also had a flavin binding domain for FAD (consensus sequence TX6AXGD) and two ADP binding domains (for FAD and NADH, respectively) with the consensus sequence GXGX2GX3A. These conserved features were consistent with the yellow color and UV fluorescence previously observed for reductaseDIC (10Chakraborty S. Behrens M. Herman P.L. Arendsen A.F. Hagen W.R. Carlson D.L. Wang X-Z. Weeks D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 437: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The derived amino acid sequence was homologous over its entire length to other members of the FAD-dependent pyridine nucleotide reductase family. The identities ranged from 69% with the cytochrome P450-type reductase component of dioxin dioxygenase (RedA2) from Sphingomonas sp. RW1 to 38% with rhodocoxin reductase (ThcD) from Rhodococcus erythropolis and putidaredoxin reductase (CamA) from Pseudomonas putida (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis showed that a 3.0-kb ApaI frag"

Biol. Chem. 278, 30854–30858; Nishitani, H., Lygerou, Z., and Nishimoto, T. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 30807–30816). The stabilization was attributed to deletion of the cyclin binding motif (Cy motif), which is required for its phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases. Phosphorylated Cdt1 is subsequently recognized by the F-box protein Skp2 and targeted for proteasomal mediated degradation. Using phosphopeptide mapping and mutagenesis studies, we found that threonine 29 within the N terminus of Cdt1 is phosphorylated by Cdk2 and required for interaction with Skp2. However, threonine 29 and the Cy motif are not necessary for proteolysis of Cdt1 during S phase. Mutants of Cdt1 that do not stably associate with Skp2 or cyclins are still degraded in S phase to the same extent as wild type Cdt1, indicating that other determinants within the N terminus of Cdt1 are required for degrading Cdt1. We localized the region necessary for Cdt1 degradation to the first 32 residues. Overexpression of stable forms of Cdt1 significantly delayed entry into and completion of S phase, suggesting that failure to degrade Cdt1 prevents normal progression through S phase. In contrast, Cdt1 mutants that fail to interact with Skp2 and cyclins progress through S phase with similar kinetics as wild type Cdt1 but stimulate the re-replication caused by overexpressing Cdt1. Therefore, a Skp2-independent pathway that requires the N-terminal 32 residues of Cdt1 is critical for the degradation of Cdt1 in S phase, and this degradation is necessary for the optimum progression of cells through S phase. Previous reports have shown that the N terminus of Cdt1 is required for its degradation during S phase (Li, X., Zhao, Q., Liao, R., Sun, P., and Wu, X. (2003) J. Biol.

During G1 phase of the cell cycle, large multi-protein complexes referred to as pre-replicative complexes (pre-RCs) 1The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, pre-replicative complex; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; Cy motif, cyclin binding motif; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ORC, origin recognition complex; WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, pre-replicative complex; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; Cy motif, cyclin binding motif; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ORC, origin recognition complex; WT, wild type. assemble at replication origins throughout the genome, “licensing” the DNA for replication in S phase (1Blow J.J. Hodgson B. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 72-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Pre-RCs form in a stepwise fashion, beginning with the six-subunit origin recognition complex (ORC) that binds to origins and recruits Cdc6 and Cdt1, which are, in turn, both required for the subsequent recruitment of the replicative helicase Mcm2-7 (3Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). Transition to S phase is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the levels of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), which activate pre-RCs by mediating recruitment of the replicative polymerases that begin DNA synthesis. High Cdk activity during S phase also inhibits the formation of new pre-RCs. Therefore, origins are prevented from becoming relicensed until the next M/G1 transition, at which point cyclins are rapidly degraded and pre-RCs are again allowed to assemble. Consistent with this model, perturbation of Cdk levels such as inhibiting Cdk activity in G2 is sufficient to stimulate re-replication (4Broek D. Bartlett R. Crawford K. Nurse P. Nature. 1991; 349: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 5Dahmann C. Diffley J.F. Nasmyth K.A. Curr.

Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition to Cdk activity, metazoans have developed another mechanism for preventing re-replication involving the protein geminin. Geminin prevents inappropriate licensing by binding to and inhibiting Cdt1 (7Tada S. Li A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 8Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A.

Cdt1 overexpression or geminin silencing results in re-replication and genomic instability, highlighting the importance of properly regulating Cdt1 (10Vaziri C. Saxena S. Jeon Y. Lee C. Murata K.

Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The levels of Cdt1 are regulated during the cell cycle, being stable in G1 when pre-RCs are formed and degraded in S phase when pre-RCs are fired and disassembled (8Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 13Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Regulation is primarily at the protein level, as mRNA levels of Cdt1 remain constant throughout the cell cycle (13Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that Cdt1 is phosphorylated in vivo and that its phosphorylation is required for interaction with the F-box protein Skp2 (14Li X. Zhao Q. Liao R. Sun P. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30854-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Skp2 is a component of the SCF complex, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The SCFSkp2 complex has been implicated in the ubiquitination and ensuing proteasomal degradation of several cell cycle proteins at the G1/S transition, with the Skp2 subunit specifically recognizing phosphorylated substrates. Subsequently, it was shown that Cdt1 is phosphorylated by Cdks, suggesting that Cdt1 degradation is mediated through Cdk phosphorylation, which targets it for ubiquitination by SCFSkp2 (15Liu E. Li X. Yan F. Zhao Q. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17283-17288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Sugimoto N. Tatsumi Y. Tsurumi T. Matsukage A. Kiyono T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 30807-30816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, definitive evidence for this molecular mechanism is still lacking. Skp2-/- murine cells have been reported to show no difference in the expression of Cdt1 protein compared with that of wild type (WT) cells (18Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Miyake S. Ishida N. Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M. Iemura S. Natsume T. Nakayama K.I. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 661-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Although transient silencing of Skp2 by RNA interference increases Cdt1 steady state levels (14Li X. Zhao Q. Liao R. Sun P. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30854-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), reducing Skp2 levels also has been shown to prevent entry into S phase by stabilizing p27 (19Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 20Kossatz U. Dietrich N. Zender L. Buer J. Manns M.P. Malek N.P. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2602-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Because Cdt1 is stable in G1 phase, altering cell cycle progression could explain changes in Cdt1 stability. Additional evidence arguing against Cdk-mediated Skp2 degradation includes recent experiments in Xenopus demonstrating a Cdk-independent mechanism for degrading Cdt1 after origin firing (22Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Based on these conflicting data, we decided to more closely examine the significance of the interactions between Cdt1, Skp2, and Cdk phosphorylation in mammalian cells by identifying the phosphoresidues on Cdt1 required for Skp2 binding. By using point mutants of Cdt1, we avoid the nonspecific effects generated by manipulating Skp2 levels. Although we confirm that the N terminus of Cdt1 is required for its degradation, mutants of Cdt1 that do not interact with Skp2 and cyclins are still degraded during S phase, suggesting the presence of Skp2-independent pathways for Cdt1 destruction in S phase. These mutants stimulate the re-replication observed by overexpressing Cdt1, suggesting that phosphorylation by cyclin/Cdk2 and/or interaction with Skp2 has a negative effect on Cdt1 activity independent of proteolysis. In contrast, expression of Cdt1 mutants that are stable during S phase cause a delayed entry into and completion of S phase, suggesting that failure to degrade Cdt1 prevents proper progression through S phase. Cell Culture and Transfections—HeLa and 293T cells were grown as adherent monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% donor calf serum. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) reagent or electroporation for chromatin fractionation experiments using Amaxa Nucleofector according to the manufacturer's instructions. For FACS analyses, a plasmid expressing farnesylated green fluorescent protein, pEGFP (Clontech), was included at a 1:5 ratio. Cells were synchronized using nocodazole (40 ng/ml) overnight and released by washing with drug-free medium. Cells were harvested 8 h after release to obtain cells synchronized in G1 phase. For S phase synchronization, cells were released from nocodazole into medium containing 2.5 mm hydroxyurea and harvested after 14 h. Plasmids—The plasmids for expression of recombinant cyclin A/Cdk2 in Escherichia coli were described previously (8Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 23Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Takeda D.Y. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression plasmids for HA-tagged Cdt1 were constructed by sub-cloning Cdt1 from pGEX-5X1 into pAHP (24Delmolino L.M. Saha P. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26947-26954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites. For plasmids expressing GST-tagged Cdt1 in mammalian cells, Cdt1 was amplified by PCR using primers engineered with restriction sites and cloned into the SpeI and NotI sites of pEBG. Mutations in Cdt1 were created using the Stratagene QuikChange protocol with the following oligonucleotides pairs: 5′-AGGCCACCGGCCCGCGCTGCAGCGCGGCTGTCGGTGGAC-3′ and 5′-AGGCCACCGGCCCGCGCTGCAGCGCGGCTGTCGGTGGAC-3′ for Cdt1(ΔCy); 5′-AAGCTGGCCTGCCGAGCTCCCAGCCCCGCCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGGCGGGGCTGGGAGCTCGGCAGGCCAGCTT-3′ for Cdt1(T29A); and 5′-GCCTGCCGCACGCCGGCCCCCGCCAGGCCCGCA-3′ and 5′-GCCTGCCGCACGCCGGCCCCCGCCAGGCCCGCA-3′ for Cdt1(S31A). N-terminal mutants of Cdt1 were generated by PCR using primers corresponding to the appropriate positions in Cdt1 and cloned into the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites of pAHP. Cdt1(Δ20–32) was made by annealing the oligonucleotides 5′-AATTCATGGAGCAGCGCCGCGTCACCGACTTCTTCGCGCGCCGCCGCCCCGGGCCCCCCCGCG-3′ and 5′-AATTCGCGGGGGGGCCCGGGGCGGCGGCGCGCGAAGAAGTCGGTGACGCGGCGCTGCTCCATG-3′ and cloning into the EcoRI site of pAHP-Cdt1(Δ32). Phosphopeptide Mapping by Mass Spectrometry—Recombinant Cdt1 and cyclin A/Cdk2 were purified from E. coli as described previously (8Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) for use in in vitro kinase assays. Reactions were carried out in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% Triton X-100) with 500 ng of substrate and started by the addition of 1 μl of enzyme in a total volume of 30 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer followed by boiling. For in vivo phosphopeptide mapping, 293T cells were transfected with pEBG-Cdt1 (1–93) and harvested after 48 h with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4 supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). GST-tagged Cdt1 was purified by binding to glutathione-agarose (Sigma). Protein was eluted with reduced glutathione, and cysteines were alkylated using iodoacetamide (Sigma). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The band corresponding to Cdt1 was excised from the gel and subjected to an in-gel tryptic digest followed by tandem mass spectrometry performed by the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard Medical School. Immunoprecipitations, Immunoblotting, and Chromatin Fractionation—Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4 supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). MG132 (Sigma) treatment was performed using a final concentration of 25 μm for 1 h prior to harvesting. Chromatin fractionation experiments were done as described previously (25Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3122-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were Cdt1 (8Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T.

Walter J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), geminin (8Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), and α-tubulin (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed according to standard procedures. FACS Analysis—Cells harvested with trypsin were fixed with 70% ethanol and incubated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide, 5 μg/ml RNase, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. At least 10,000 cells were counted per sample. FACS analyses were performed using a BD Biosciences flow cytometer and CellQuest™ software. The N Terminus of Cdt1 Regulates Its Stability during S Phase—Within the N terminus of Cdt1 are several putative CDK phosphorylation sites as well as the previously identified cyclin binding motif (Cy motif) located at residues 67–71 (15Liu E. Li X. Yan F. Zhao Q. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17283-17288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Sugimoto N. Tatsumi Y. Tsurumi T. Matsukage A. Kiyono T. Nishitani H. Fujita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19691-19697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, we constructed an N-terminal truncation mutant of Cdt1 by deleting the first 93 amino acids. We also needed to append an SV40 nuclear localization signal in order to properly localize Cdt1(Δ93) to the nucleus (17Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30807-30816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were co-transfected with WT Cdt1 and Cdt1(Δ93) and synchronized in mitosis with nocodazole. To collect cells in G1, cells were harvested 8 h after release from nocodazole. Cells in S phase were obtained by releasing cells from nocodazole into hydroxyurea. FACS analysis and immunoblotting with anticyclin A were used to confirm the cell cycle phase. Fig. 1B shows that WT Cdt1 is stable in G1 and degraded in S phase, identical to what is seen with endogenous Cdt1 (Fig. 1A). These results also indicate that we are not overwhelming the degradative machinery by overexpressing Cdt1. In contrast, Cdt1(Δ93) is stable in S phase (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the first 93 amino acids of Cdt1 are necessary for its degradation during S phase. Recent studies report that the N terminus of Cdt1 is not required for its licensing function, indicating that deleting the N terminus of Cdt1 does not result in a completely misfolded and nonfunctional protein (27Li A. Blow J.J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 28Ferenbach A. Li A. Brito-Martins M. Blow J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mapping the Phosphorylation Sites of Cdt1 in Vitro and in Vivo—Because phosphorylation of Cdt1 is required for association with Skp2 (16Sugimoto N. Tatsumi Y. Tsurumi T. Matsukage A. Kiyono T. Nishitani H. Fujita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19691-19697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we mapped the phosphorylation sites of Cdt1 in vitro and in vivo. Full-length WT Cdt1 was phosphorylated in vitro using recombinant cyclin A/Cdk2 (Fig. 2A). Cdt1 was separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion followed by mass spectrometry. Phosphopeptide mapping revealed three phosphorylated residues within the first 93 amino acids. Two residues, threonine 29 and serine 31, are followed by a proline consistent with the (S/T)P consensus Cdk phosphorylation motif. The third residue identified, threonine 7, is within a noncanonical Cdk consensus sequence that may be an artifact of the in vitro phosphorylation reaction. To examine whether these sites are phosphorylated in vivo, we transfected cells with a plasmid expressing the N terminus of Cdt1, Cdt1-(1–93), tagged with GST for affinity purification using glutathione-agarose. Purification and mass spectrometry results are shown in Fig. 2B and indicate that threonine 29 and serine 31 are also phosphorylated in vivo. Although there are other potential phosphorylation sites present in peptides that were not recovered, the in vivo results supported the in vitro phosphorylation data and provided a starting point for mutagenesis studies. Threonine 29 Is Important for Cdt1 Interaction with Skp2— Based on the phosphopeptide mapping results, we constructed point mutants that had threonine 29 mutated to alanine, Cdt1(T29A), or serine 31 mutated to alanine, Cdt1(S31A). The Cy motif mutant Cdt1(ΔCy) was created by mutating residues 67–69, which correspond to RRL of the Cy motif, to AAA. This mutation has been shown to prevent the stable association of cyclins with Cdt1 in vitro and in vivo (16Sugimoto N. Tatsumi Y. Tsurumi T. Matsukage A. Kiyono T. Nishitani H. Fujita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19691-19697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We also constructed a mutant containing all three mutations Cdt1(T29A,S31A,ΔCy). These plasmids were transfected into cells in order to examine their interaction with Skp2 by immunoprecipitation. Wild type Cdt1 co-precipitated endogenous Skp2 (Fig. 3, lane 2). However, mutation of the Cy motif completely abolished the stable interaction between Cdt1 and Skp2 (Fig. 3, lane 5) as described previously (15Liu E. Li X. Yan F. Zhao Q. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17283-17288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Sugimoto N. Tatsumi Y. Tsurumi T. Matsukage A. Kiyono T. Nishitani H. Fujita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19691-19697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Similarly, Cdt1(T29A) failed to co-precipitate Skp2 (Fig. 3, lane 3). In contrast, mutation of serine 31 to alanine had no effect on Skp2 association (Fig. 3, lane 4). The construct containing all three mutations also did not co-precipitate Skp2 as predicted. Therefore, we conclude that threonine 29 and the Cy motif are both necessary for Cdt1 interaction with Skp2. The position of threonine 29 is similar to that of previously described Cdk substrates that locate the Cy motif C-terminal to the Cdk phosphoacceptor sites (29Takeda D.Y. Wohlschlegel J.A. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1993-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The distance between threonine 29 and the Cy motif is also greater than the minimal number of residues required for bipartite substrate recognition by cyclin A/Cdk2 (29Takeda D.Y. Wohlschlegel J.A. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1993-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cdt1 Mutants That Do Not Interact with Skp2 and Cyclins Are Still Degraded during S Phase—Because Cdt1(T29A) and Cdt1(ΔCy) fail to interact with Skp2 in vivo and because Skp2 has been suggested to be the main mechanism by which Cdt1 is degraded during the cell cycle (14Li X. Zhao Q. Liao R. Sun P. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30854-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we expected Cdt1(T29A) and Cdt1(ΔCy) to be resistant to proteasome-mediated degradation. Plasmids expressing WT or mutant Cdt1 were transfected into HeLa cells and harvested at G1 or S phase following a nocodazole block and release as done in Fig. 1. Cdt1(Δ93) was co-transfected to allow comparison between the point mutants and a stable form of Cdt1 within the same sample. Extracts were immunoblotted with cyclin A to confirm G1 and S phase of the cell cycle. As expected, Cdt1(Δ93) is stable in S phase (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly Cdt1(T29A) and Cdt1(ΔCy) were degraded in S phase similar to WT Cdt1 and Cdt1(S31A). Degradation of Cdt1 was still proteasome-mediated, as treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prior to harvesting stabilized Cdt1(T29A) and Cdt1(ΔCy) during S phase (Fig. 4B). To rule out artifacts caused by pharmacological inhibition of the cell cycle, we also examined the stability of the different Cdt1 proteins in an unperturbed S phase by harvesting cells at various time points following a release from nocodazole (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–8). Under these conditions, WT Cdt1 and Cdt1(ΔCy) were still degraded as cells entered S phase (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–8), whereas Cdt1(Δ93) was stable (Fig. 4C, lanes 13–16). Therefore interaction with Skp2 is not required for the degradation of Cdt1 during S phase, suggesting the presence of Skp2-independent mechanisms for degrading Cdt1 during S phase. Residues 1–32 of Cdt1 Are Required for S Phase-specific Degradation of Cdt1—Because Cdt1(Δ93) is stable in S phase, we hypothesized that there must be another signal within the first 93 amino acids that targets Cdt1 for degradation independent of Skp2 and cyclin binding. Therefore, we made truncation mutants of the N terminus of Cdt1 that deleted the first 19, 32, and 60 amino acids. When these mutants were analyzed during the cell cycle, Cdt1(Δ19) was degraded, whereas Cdt1(Δ32) and Cdt1(Δ60) were stable during S phase (Figs. 5A and 4C). The addition of MG132 during S phase also did not have an effect on the levels of Cdt1(Δ32) (Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 8). Based on these results, we also tested Cdt1 with an internal deletion of residues 20–32, Cdt1-(Δ20–32). However Cdt1-(Δ20–32) was still degraded in S phase (Fig. 5B), suggesting that there may be two redundant signals in the N terminus of Cdt1 that signal Cdt1 degradation during S phase. Therefore, we conclude that residues 1–32 are necessary for degradation of Cdt1 during S phase. Failure to Degrade Cdt1 Results in an Altered S Phase Progression—Having two forms of Cdt1 that were stable in S phase, we examined the significance of Cdt1 degradation during the cell cycle (Figs. 6 and 7). HeLa cells transfected with various Cdt1 plasmids were harvested at various time points following release from nocodazole. To analyze transfected cells by FACS, a plasmid expressing farnesylated GFP was co-transfected, and GFP-positive cells were counted. The cell cycle profile of cells expressing wild type Cdt1, Cdt1(T29A), or Cdt1(ΔCy) were identical to control cells. However, the cell cycle progression of cells transfected with Cdt1(Δ32) or Cdt1(Δ93) was significantly different. After 6 h, Cdt1(Δ32)- and Cdt1(Δ93)-expressing cells had entered G1 and showed a FACS profile identical to the other Cdt1 constructs and control cells. However, at 12 and 18 h after release, cells transfected with Cdt1(Δ32) and Cdt1(Δ93) displayed predominantly 2n DNA characteristic of G1 phase, whereas the majority of cells transfected with wild type Cdt1, Cdt1(T29A), or Cdt1(ΔCy) entered S phase and displayed greater than 2n DNA content. Even after 24 h when most of the control, wild type Cdt1-, Cdt1(T29A)-, and Cdt1(ΔCy)-transfected cells had completed S phase, cells expressing Cdt1(Δ32) or Cdt1(Δ93) still had very few cells with greater than 2n DNA content (Fig. 7). The effect of stable Cdt1 expression appears to be a delayed entry into S phase rather than a complete cell cycle arrest, because the cells eventually display 4n DNA after 54 h (Fig. 9). The duration of S phase is also longer with Cdt1(Δ32) and Cdt1(Δ93). The earliest time point at which S phase cells are visible for control cells and cells expressing wild type Cdt1 is 12 h after release. At the 24- and 30-h time points the majority of these cells contain 4n DNA, indicating that it takes ∼12–18 h to complete replication. However, cells expressing Cdt1(Δ32), which begin to enter S phase at the 24-h time point, are still in S phase 18 h later at the 42-h time point. Therefore, stabilizing Cdt1 also increases the length of S phase. The FACS profile of Cdt1(Δ93) was almost identical to Cdt1(Δ32), suggesting that the region of Cdt1 responsible for the effects seen with Cdt1(Δ93) is contained within the first 32 amino acids.Fig. 7Stable mutants prevent efficient progression through S phase.

P-TEFb stimulates transcription by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. It becomes inactivated when associated in a tetrameric complex with the abundant 7SK small nuclear RNA and the recently identified protein Hexim1. In this study, we identified a stable and soluble C-terminal domain (residues 255–359) in Hexim1 of 12.5-kDa size that binds the cyclin boxes of Cyclin T1. Functional assays in HeLa cells showed that this cyclin T-binding domain (TBD) is required for the binding of Hexim1 to P-TEFb and inhibition of transcriptional activity in vivo. Analytical gel filtration and GST pull-down experiments revealed that both full-length Hexim1 and the TBD are homodimers. Isothermal titration calorimetry yielded a weak multimer for the TBD with a multimerization constant of 1.3 × 103 m. The binding affinity between the TBD and cyclin T1 was analyzed with fluorescence spectroscopy methods, using a dansyl-based fluorescence label at position G257C. Equilibrium fluorescence titration and stopped flow fast kinetics yield a dissociation constant of 1.2 μm. Finally, we tested the effect of the HIV-1 Tat protein on the cyclin T1-TBD complex formation. GST pull-down experiments and size exclusion chromatography exhibit a mutually exclusive binding of the two effectors to cyclin T1. Our data suggest a model where HIV-1 Tat competes with Hexim1 for cyclin T1 binding, thus releasing P-TEFb from the inactive complex to stimulate the transcription of HIV-1 gene expression.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The action of P-TEFb has been studied most intensively in the regulation of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gene expression, which is the paradigm for the control of transcription at the level of elongation. Shortly after promoter clearance, RNA polymerase II stalls due to the action of the negative elongation factor, which consists minimally of the sensitivity-inducing factor 5,6-dichloro-1-6-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole riboside (DSIF) and the negative elongation factor (2Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 3Sims III, R.J. Belotserkovskaya R. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2437-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). During this postinitiation block, only short transcripts arise that may be prematurely terminated (1Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 4Kao S.Y. Calman A.F. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In HIV-infected cells, this block is relieved by the recruitment of P-TEFb to the paused RNA polymerase II by the viral Tat (transcriptional transactivator protein). P-TEFb phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase II as well as the Spt5 subunit in DSIF and the RD subunit in negative elongation factor. As a consequence, transcription elongation ensues. In addition to HIV gene expression, cellular genes require P-TEFb as well. On one hand, short transcripts have been also found during transcription of many genes, including c-myb, c-myc, c-fos, and HSP70. On the other hand, several eukaryotic transcription factors bind P-TEFb to stimulate transcription (for a review, see Ref. 5Garriga J. Grana X. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 337: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Finally, DRB and flavopiridol, two ATP analogs that inhibit the kinase activity of Cdk9 (cyclin-dependent kinase 9), inhibit nearly all transcription by RNA polymerase II in human cells (6Chao S.H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31793-31799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The active P-TEFb complex is composed of two subunits, Cdk9 and its regulatory subunit, cyclin T1, T2, or K. However, unlike other Cdks and their cyclin partners, P-TEFb is constitutively expressed, and its protein levels vary little throughout the cell cycle (7Garriga J. Bhattacharya S. Calbo J. Marshall R.M. Truongcao M. Haines D.S. Grana X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5165-5173Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a large inactive P-TEFb complex has been identified only recently, which comprises four subunits: Cdk9, cyclin T1 or T2, the abundant small nuclear RNA 7SK (8Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K.

Nature. 2001; 414: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), and the coupling protein Hexim1 (hexamethylene bisacetamide-inducible protein 1) (10Yik J.H. Chen R. Nishimura R. Jennings J.L.

Hexim1 (also named MAQ1) has been identified in human vascular smooth muscle cells after treatment with hexamethylene bisacetamide (12Kusuhara M. Nagasaki K. Kimura K. Maass N. Manabe T. Ishikawa S. Aikawa M. Miyazaki K. Yamaguchi K. Biomed. Res. 1999; 20: 273-279Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and was shown to suppress the transcriptional activity of cotransfected genes such as NF-κB or HIV-1 long terminal repeat (10Yik J.H.

Makino Y. Morimoto C. Handa H. Ohsuzu F. Tanaka H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Roughly half of nuclear P-TEFb in HeLa cells is sequestered in an inactive state; however, inactive and active P-TEFb complexes can rapidly interchange upon treatment with stress-inducing agents (10Yik J.H.

Cardiac hypertrophy inducers have been reported as physiological triggers of P-TEFb/7SK dissociation in cardiomyocytes (14Sano M. Abdellatif M. Oh H. Xie M. Bagella L. Giordano A. Michael L.H. DeMayo F.J. Schneider M.D. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A transcriptional arrest triggers dissociation of 7SK and Hexim1 from Cdk9 and Cyclin T1 (or T2) and subsequent accumulation of kinase-active P-TEFb (8Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 9Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A. Bensaude O. Nature. 2001; 414: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). 7SK snRNA and Hexim1 thus form a kinase inhibitor that contributes to the regulation of gene transcription. On a molecular level, several interaction sites that influence the formation of the large P-TEFb-Hexim1–7SK snRNA complex have been identified until now by mostly functional studies in cells. First, nuclear localization of Hexim1 was shown to result from a lysine-rich nuclear localization signal in its central part (150–177) (11Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 13Ouchida R. Kusuhara M. Shimizu N. Hisada T. Makino Y. Morimoto C. Handa H. Ohsuzu F.

Biol. 2004; 24: 5094-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Second, a C-terminal region of Hexim1 (residues 181–359) binds directly to the N-terminal cyclin box repeats of cyclins T1 and T2 (11Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F.

Price D.H. Lania L. Bensaude O. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2608-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Third, Hexim1 binds directly to the 175 nucleotides at the 5′ end of 7SK snRNA with a polybasic recognition motif (residues 152–155), whereas mutation of a conserved motif (PYNT, residues 202–205) suppresses P-TEFb binding and inhibition (16Michels A.A. Fraldi A. Li Q. Adamson T.E. Bonnet F. Nguyen V.T. Sedore S.C. Price J.P. Price D.H. Lania L. Bensaude O. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2608-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Finally, phosphorylation of the kinase Cdk9, on possibly the conserved residue Thr186 in the T-loop of the kinase, is important for the 7SK-P-TEFb interaction (17Chen R. Yang Z. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4153-4160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Most recently, a related protein termed Hexim2 has been identified that regulates P-TEFb similarly as Hexim1 through association with 7SK (18Byers S.A. Price J.P. Cooper J.J. Li Q. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16360-16367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Yik J.H. Chen R. Pezda A.C. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16368-16376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a stable 12-kDa C-terminal cyclin T-binding domain of Hexim1 (TBD; residues 255–359) that is sufficient to bind cyclin T1 in vitro and is required for the binding to P-TEFb and inhibition of transcription in vivo. Fast fluorescence studies reveal a dissociation constant of both molecules around 1 μm. From size exclusion chromatography and isothermal titration calorimetry, full-length Hexim1 as well as the C-terminal domain are found to be dimeric, whereas the cyclin T1-Hexim1 complex is heterodimeric. Finally, HIV-1 Tat and Hexim1 bind mutually exclusively to cyclin T1, suggesting a competition between Tat and Hexim1 for a similar binding site on cyclin T1. Protein Sequence Analysis—Computational investigations of the human Hexim1 sequence (BAA36166) were done prior to protein fragmentation. For domain architecture analyses, the following open access programs were quoted: SMART (available on the World Wide Web at smart.embl-heidelberg.de/), Prosite (available on the World Wide Web at au.expasy.org/prosite/), AnDom (available on the World Wide Web at www.bork.embl-heidelberg.de/AnDom/), and PFam (available on the World Wide Web at pfam.wustl.edu/). Coiled-coil predictions were run at EMBL computational services (available on the World Wide Web at www.russell.embl.de/cgi-bin/coils-svr.pl), and secondary structure predictions were calculated using PredictProtein (available on the World Wide Web at www.predictprotein.org/), the PSIPRED Protein Structure Prediction Server (available on the World Wide Web at bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/), Scratch at the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics, University of California Irvine (available on the World Wide Web at www.igb.uci.edu/tools/scratch/), and Sequence Alignment and Modeling System-Target99 (SAM-T99) at the University of California Santa Cruz (available on the World Wide Web at www.soe.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/HMM-apps/). Protein Expression, Purification, and Fluorescence Labeling—Plasmids encoding Hexim1 (accession number AB021179) were generated by PCR-mediated amplification with a primer containing NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites and cloned into the procaryotic expression vectors pProEx-HTa (Invitrogen) or pGEX-4T1-tev (Amersham Biosciences) for protein expression and purification. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the megaprimer method with both sense and antisense oligonucleotides. The plasmid coding for the CycT1-Tat fusion protein was described previously (20Fujinaga K. Irwin D. Taube R. Zhang F. Geyer M. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12934-12939Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For Hexim1-TBD protein expression plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen), expressed at 30 °C, and induced at an A600 of 0.6–1.0 with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5-h growth. Full-length Hexim1 and Hexim1 (residues 1–254) proteins were grown at 18 °C and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for overnight expression. Cells were fluidized in lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with 20 mm imidazole and cleared by spinning for 45 min at 30,000 × g. The lysate was loaded onto 5 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) that had been pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. After washing with 10 volumes of lysis buffer A, the protein was eluted with 10 volumes of lysis buffer A using a linear gradient from 20 to 250 mm imidazole. The peak fractions were dialyzed in buffer A, and the histidine tag was cleaved off at 4 °C over 12 h with Tev protease. Hexim1 was depleted of the protease and of the uncleaved His-Hexim1 by affinity chromatography. The protein-containing flow-through was concentrated and then further purified by gel filtration on an S75 column in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing Hexim1 (about 98% pure) were concentrated and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by extinction coefficient measurements. The surface-exposed cysteine at position 257 of the mutant protein Hexim1 (255–359, G257C, C297S) was labeled in thiol-free buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol (v/v)) with a 10-fold excess of 5-2-iodoacetylaminoethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (1,5-IAEDANS) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The reaction was carried out at 4 °C for 12 h and subsequently stopped by buffer exchange via gel filtration. Labeling efficiency and specificity was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and removal of excess fluorophore was proved by SDS-PAGE using UV irradiation. GST Pull-down Assays—For direct interaction assays between Hexim1, cyclin T1, and Tat, about 2 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with 10–20 μg of the respective target protein. Binding reactions were performed in 500 μl of buffer solution (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 2–4 h at 4 °C or for 0.5 h at room temperature, respectively. Beads were washed 3–5 times in the same buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by Coomassie SDS-PAGE. In Vivo Binding and Inhibition Assays—Plasmid reporter pG6TAR was described previously (21Taube R. Lin X. Irwin D. Fujinaga K. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell.

Plasmids coding for the FLAG-tagged full-length Hexim1 (pFLAG-CMV-2.Hexim1) and C-terminal deletion constructs were a kind gift from Dr. Zhou and Dr. Tanaka and were described previously (10Yik J.H.

Makino Y. Morimoto C. Handa H. Ohsuzu F. Tanaka H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To construct plasmids coding for the mutant Hexim1 (G257C/C297S) protein, the pFLAG-CMV-2.Hexim1 plasmid was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μg each of penicillin and streptomycin per ml. Cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The goat polyclonal anti-CycT1 (sc-8127) antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody and the anti-FLAG M2 beads were purchased from Sigma. HeLa cells were seeded into 6-well plates or 50-mm diameter Petri dishes ∼12 h prior to transfection and transiently transfected with FuGene6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzymatic assays were performed as described (22Fujinaga K. Cujec T.P. Peng J. Garriga J. Price D.H. Grana X. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all transfections, the amount of DNA was equilibrated with a corresponding empty vector. The activity of the reporter plasmid alone is given as 1. Data are representative of three independent transfections, which were performed in duplicate. The error bars give S.E. HeLa cells were seeded into 100-mm diameter Petri dishes and transfected with the indicated plasmid vectors. About 36 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in 0.8 ml of lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% protease inhibitor) for 1 h at 40 °C. Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG M2 beads and examined for the presence of CycT1 and FLAG-tagged Hexim1 proteins by Western blotting with the anti-CycT1 and anti-FLAG antibodies according to standard protocols, respectively. Analytical Gel Filtration—Analytical gel filtration was performed with a multicomponent Waters 626 LC system (Waters, MA) using a Superdex 75 column (10/30; column volume 25.7 ml; Amersham Biosciences). The column was first equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithioerythritol following injection of the samples (30–50 μg). The flow rate was set to 0.5 ml/min. Elution profiles were monitored by UV absorption at 280 nm and calibrated to a low molecular weight standard (Amersham Biosciences). Equimolar concentrations of CycT1 and Hexim1 were mixed 30 min prior to the experiment and incubated at 25 °C. Gel filtration experiments were performed at room temperature. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The thermodynamic parameter of Hexim1 multimerization and the CycT1/Hexim1-TBD interaction were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (MCS-ITC; MicroCal, Amherst, MA). For Hexim1 dissociation experiments, 500 μm Hexim1-TBD was placed in the syringe and injected into the cell, which was filled with the same buffer solution. For complex formation experiments, CycT1 was placed into the cell at concentrations varying between 5 and 70 μm, and a 10-fold higher concentration of Hexim1-TBD was filled in the syringe. Data evaluation was performed using the manufacturer's analysis software, yielding ΔG0 and ΔH0 values with 0.5 kcal/mol errors each. All ITC experiments were carried out at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.8) and 50 mm NaCl. Fluorescence Spectroscopy Measurements and Data Analysis—All fluorescence measurements were performed at 20 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 mm dithioerythritol. Equilibrium measurements were carried out on a SPEX FluoroMax III spectrofluorometer (JobinYvon, Longjumeau, France) at an excitation wavelength of 337 nm and a band pass of ±1 nm. For emission spectra, fluorescence emission was monitored with a band pass of ±2.5 nm between 400 and 600 nm. For titrations, emission was followed at a fixed wavelength of 490 nm with a band pass of ±7.5 nm. Binding curves, titration experiments, and dissociation experiments were analyzed with Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Corp.). Stopped Flow Measurements—Measurements of association rates were done using an SX.18MV stopped flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics, Surrey, UK) by rapid mixing of 3 μm Hexim1-TBD-EDANS and 1.5–30 μm GST-CycT1-(1–292). The dansyl-based fluorophore was excited at 337 nm, and the fluorescence emission was recorded through a 420-nm cut-off filter. Binding of CycT1 to Hexim1-TBD was detected by a change in the fluorescence of the EDANS fluorophore coupled to cysteine 257. An exponential equation was fitted to the fluorescence traces according to pseudo-first-order kinetics. The resulting inverse time constant corresponds to the observed rate constant kobs within an experimental error of 2–10%. Unless indicated otherwise, all measurements were done in buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.8) and 50 mm NaCl at 20 °C. Indication of a Highly Charged C-terminal Domain in Hexim1—We started to analyze the human Hexim1 protein (accession number BAA36166) by computational methods, including modular domain searches and secondary structure prediction analyses (Fig. 1). As was found in SMART, Prosite, AnDom, and PFam investigations, the 41-kDa Hexim1 protein does not contain any known functional or structural domain but is proposed to carry a central bipartite nuclear localization signal, which has already been confirmed in cellular studies (11Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 13Ouchida R. Kusuhara M. Shimizu N. Hisada T. Makino Y. Morimoto C. Handa H. Ohsuzu F. Tanaka H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Yik J.H. Chen R. Pezda A.C. Samford C.S. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5094-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a C-terminal coiled-coil region from position 283 to 349 or from position 284 to 314 and position 322 to 342 was suggested (coiled-coil prediction). Overall, the protein is highly hydrophilic, with 125 charged residues of 359 amino acids (Fig. 1B). These charges are distributed almost homogeneously over the entire protein but accumulate in one positive cluster (residues 150–165; nuclear localization signal) and two negative clusters (residues 211–219 and 234–253). On average, nontransmembrane human proteins contain only 23% charged residues, whereas Hexim1 contains 35%. Similarly, bulky hydrophobic residues such as Leu, Ile, Val, Met, and Phe are spread over the whole protein with slightly higher appearance C-terminal to position 250 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, numerous proline residues that often induce nonstructured regions occur particularly frequently in the N-terminal part of Hexim1 up to position 133 followed by another five prolines until position 218, whereas only one is found in the C-terminal 141 residues. The protein sequence analysis was complemented by secondary structure predictions from four independent calculations (Fig. 1C). Overall, only a small part of Hexim1 is predicted to adopt an α-helical fold, whereas large segments, particularly of the N-terminal region, are proposed to be unfolded. The suggested helical parts converge into two clusters from position 170 to 195 and for the proposed coiled-coil region from position 260 to 350. The prediction of unfolded regions in the N-terminal region may be most likely due to the high degree of polarity and the numerous glutamic acid (13.0%), proline (9.6%), serine (7.5%), glutamine (7.5%), and lysine (7.1%) residues. These residues often indicate intrinsically unstructured protein domains (23Tompa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). The detailed reliability index of the prediction for α-helical and extended secondary structure elements as derived from the PredictProtein calculation is shown in Fig. 1D. In summary, the C terminus of Hexim1 is proposed to form a folded region, whereas the N-terminal part appears rather unstructured. The C-terminal Domain of Hexim1 Interacts with Cyclin T1 Directly in Vitro—To investigate the proposed domain modules in Hexim1, we cloned four different constructs as His epitope-tagged fusion proteins, expressed these in E. coli, and used affinity tag chromatography for purification. High protein yields could be obtained using standard protocols; however, full-length Hexim1 as well as the N-terminal fragment 1–254 appeared less stable during purification and were degraded, whereas the C-terminal fragments 255–359 and 266–359 remained stable and soluble. Interestingly, the 41-kDa Hexim1 protein migrated through the SDS-PAGE at an apparent size of 70 kDa, as observed before (11Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 13Ouchida R. Kusuhara M. Shimizu N. Hisada T. Makino Y. Morimoto C. Handa H. Ohsuzu F. Tanaka H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similarly, the 28.1-kDa N-terminal fragment 1–254 migrated very slowly at 50 kDa, whereas the two C-terminal 12.5- and 11.4-kDa fragments run at their expected sizes (Fig. 2, lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12). Molecular masses of the expressed proteins were confirmed for control by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data not shown). These migration patterns may indicate that the N-terminal region of Hexim1 is largely unfolded, whereas the C terminus represents a structured domain. Direct binding of Hexim1 to the cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb was analyzed by GST pull-down experiments, using the cyclin box repeats of CycT1 (residues 1–292) fused to GST and coupled to GSH-Sepharose beads. We found that full-length Hexim1 as well as the two C-terminal fragments bind CycT1 directly but not the N-terminal fragment 1–254 (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11). Incubation and washing conditions were chosen so that Hexim1 proteins do not bind arbitrarily to GST-loaded beads (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10). Since the C-terminal fragment 255–359 appeared easier to handle in terms of expression yields, affinity tag removal, and solubility than the shorter fragment 266–359, we consider this 12.5-kDa fragment the TBD of Hexim1. The C-terminal Domain of Hexim1 Is Required for Binding to P-TEFb and the Inhibition of Transcription in Cells—To extend the findings from the binding experiment in vitro and to address the requirement for the C-terminal domain of Hexim1 for its function, we performed functional studies in HeLa cells (Fig. 3). For these studies, we used a wild-type and two mutant FLAG-epitope-tagged Hexim1 proteins, in which their C termini were shortened progressively, resulting in the construction of Hexim1 from position 1 to 314 and from position 1 to 286, respectively. First, to define the importance of the C-terminal domain of Hexim1 for the binding between Hexim1 and P-TEFb, we performed immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 3A). We expressed the FLAG-tagged Hexim1 proteins by using transient expression assays in HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated them from total cell lysates using anti-FLAG-agarose beads. Their binding to endogenous P-TEFb was inspected by Western blotting using antibodies directed against CycT1. As expected, the wild-type Hexim1 protein bound CycT1 in cells. Likewise, the mutant Hexim1-(1–314) protein retained this ability. In contrast, the mutant Hexim1-(1–286) protein failed to bind CycT1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3). Levels of the FLAG-tagged Hexim1 proteins in the immunoprecipitations were comparable (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Thus, the C-terminal region in Hexim1 from position 286 to 314 is necessary for its binding to CycT1 in cells. To examine the functional importance of the C-terminal domain of H"
https://openalex.org/W2165926532,"An emerging paradigm holds that loss of negative signalling to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is permissive for their oncogenic activity. Herein, we have addressed tumor suppression by RALT/MIG-6, a transcriptionally controlled feedback inhibitor of ErbB RTKs, in breast cancer cells. Knockdown of RALT expression by RNAi enhanced the EGF-dependent proliferation of normal breast epithelial cells, indicating that loss of RALT signalling in breast epithelium may represent an advantageous condition during ErbB-driven tumorigenesis. Although mutational inactivation of the RALT gene was not detected in human breast carcinomas, RALT mRNA and protein expression was strongly and selectively reduced in ERBB2-amplified breast cancer cell lines. Reconstitution of RALT expression in ERBB2-amplified SKBr-3 and BT474 cells inhibited ErbB-2-dependent mitogenic signalling and counteracted the ability of ErbB ligands to promote resistance to the ErbB-2-targeting drug Herceptin. Thus, loss of RALT expression cooperates with ERBB2 gene amplification to drive full oncogenic signalling by the ErbB-2 receptor. Moreover, loss of RALT signalling may adversely affect tumor responses to ErbB-2-targeting agents."
https://openalex.org/W1990345723,"Microtubule-associated protein (MAP) light chain 3 (LC3) is a human homologue of yeast Apg8/Aut7/Cvt5 (Atg8), which is essential for autophagy. MAP-LC3 is cleaved by a cysteine protease to produce LC3-I, which is located in cytosolic fraction. LC3-I, in turn, is converted to LC3-II through the actions of E1- and E2-like enzymes. LC3-II is covalently attached to phosphatidylethanolamine on its C terminus, and it binds tightly to autophagosome membranes. We determined the solution structure of LC3-I and found that it is divided into N- and C-terminal subdomains. Additional analysis using a photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization technique also showed that the N-terminal subdomain of LC3-I makes contact with the surface of the C-terminal subdomain and that LC3-I adopts a single compact conformation in solution. Moreover, the addition of dodecylphosphocholine into the LC3-I solution induced chemical shift perturbations primarily in the C-terminal subdomain, which implies that the two subdomains have different sensitivities to dodecylphosphocholine micelles. On the other hand, deletion of the N-terminal subdomain abolished binding of tubulin and microtubules. Thus, we showed that two subdomains of the LC3-I structure have distinct functions, suggesting that MAP-LC3 can act as an adaptor protein between microtubules and autophagosomes.

Gelfand V.I. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These two MAPs are abundant in the nervous system and are major components of the neuronal cytoskeleton (2Bloom G.S. Schoenfeld T.A. Vallee R.B. J.

A. 1985; 82: 5404-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). They share common distributions and physiological functions. For example, both are prominently expressed throughout the brain and associate with microtubules via a microtubule-binding domain found in the N-terminal region of MAPs. This domain of MAP1B was identified as a basic region containing KKE(E/I/V) repeats (4Noble M. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3367-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and may interact with the C-terminal acidic region of tubulin. MAP1A and MAP1B act cooperatively with their light chains, MAP-LC2 and MAP-LC1, respectively. Complexes of MAP and its corresponding light chain are synthesized as a single large polyprotein and then are post-translationally cleaved into two distinct chains (5Hammarback J.A. Obar R.A. Hughes S.A. Vallee R.B. Neuron. 1991; 7: 129-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Langkopf A. Hammarback J.A. Müller R. Vallee R.B. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16561-16566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, MAP-LC3 is not synthesized from either MAP1A/LC2 or MAP1B/LC1 polyprotein mRNAs. However, MAP-LC3 co-immunoprecipitates with either MAP1A or MAP1B, indicating that this light chain is a common partner of both MAPs (7Schoenfeld T.A. McKerracher L. Obar R. Vallee R.B. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1712-1730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the expressions of MAP1A and MAP1B are known to differ as neurons grow. MAP1B is highly expressed in developing neurons, whereas the expression level of MAP1A is highest in mature neurons; in other words, MAP1A and MAP1B display complementary patterns of expression (7Schoenfeld T.A. McKerracher L. Obar R. Vallee R.B. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1712-1730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the binding activities and the co-localization with MAPs suggest that MAP-LCs are related to the development and the differentiation of neurons, the detailed physiological functions of MAPs and MAP-LCs are not yet understood. In yeast, autophagy is induced by nutrient starvation to provide the minimal nutrients for cell maintenance. To date, at least 16 genes required for autophagy have been identified, and their products are referred to as the Apg/Aut/Cvt (Atg) family (8Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y.

MAP-LC3 is a mammalian homologue of Apg8/Aut7/Cvt5 (Atg8), which is essential for the formation of autophagosomes and cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) vesicles (11Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N.

After synthesis, Atg8 is cleaved by Apg4/Aut2 (Atg4), a yeast cysteine protease, exposing the C-terminal glycine to solvent (13Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T.

Subsequently, the cleaved Atg8 is modified by Apg7/Cvt2 (Atg7) and Apg3/Aut1 (Atg3), which act as E1 and E2 enzymes of the ubiquitination system, respectively (15Kim J. Dalton V.M. Eggerton K.P.

The PE-modified form is tightly bound to autophagosomes, whereas the unmodified form is localized in the cytosolic fraction (13Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T.

Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). In addition, immunoelectron microscopy has shown that Atg8 is localized in the precursor and mature structure of autophagosomes (11Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Atg8 plays a key role in the formation of autophagosomes, which agrees with the finding that a lack of Atg8 or the inhibition of its modification causes a defect in autophagy (13Kirisako T.

Taken together, the data suggest that MAP-LC3 is involved in the formation and/or the intracellular trafficking of autophagosomes in mammalian cells. Two additional proteins have been identified as human homologues of Atg8: GABAA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) (25Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W.

The structures include an N-terminal subdomain composed of two α-helices and a C-terminal subdomain that adopts a ubiquitin fold. Interestingly, Coyle et al. (31Coyle J.E. Qamar S. Rajashankar K.R. Nikolov D.B. Neuron. 2002; 33: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) demonstrated that GABARAP undergoes a conformational change in the N-terminal region, which may be involved in the polymerization of tubulin. NMR experiments have shown that some of the heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) signals for the amino acids in the N-terminal subdomain indicate NH cross-peak doubling (28Stangler T. Mayr L.M. Dingley A.J. Luge C. Willbold D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 183-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Harris R. McAlister M.S.B. Sankar A. Phelan J.P. Moss S.J. Keep N.H.

In the present study, we did not observe NMR signals with peak doubling in the spectra of LC3-I, and we were able to use NMR spectroscopy to successfully determine the solution structure of human LC3-I. In addition, we carried out a photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo-CIDNP) experiment to obtain additional information about the N-terminal conformation of LC3-I. The photo-CIDNP approach is based on the cyclic photochemical reactions between a photoexcited dye and the amino acid residues located on the surface of a protein (35Kaptein R. Dijkstra K. Nicolay K. Nature. 1978; 274: 293-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 36Hore P.J. Broadhurst R.W. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson.

This technique selectively detects the aromatic amino acids His, Trp, and Tyr when these side chains are accessible to the dye. By investigating whether tyrosine residues in LC3-I are located on the surface of the protein, we obtained evidence that LC3-I adopts a single conformation in solution. Moreover, we explored the physiological significance of the two subdomains in LC3-I by interaction assays using surface plasmon resonance and HSQC cross-peak perturbation. We propose here that the two subdomains play different roles in the function of MAP-LC3, suggesting that MAP-LC3 acts as an adaptor protein in the autophagy system. Expression and Purification of LC3-I and Its Mutant—Recombinant LC3-I was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Uniformly 15N-labeled and 13C/15N-labeled LC3-I proteins were obtained by growing E. coli cells in minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl or a combination of [13C]glucose and 15NH4Cl, respectively. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was applied to an immobilized glutathione column (Amersham Biosciences). Bound protein was treated with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) to remove glutathione S-transferase. Finally, LC3-I protein was purified using a BioScale-S2 cation exchange column (Bio-Rad) in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0). The protein was eluted with an NaCl gradient up to 500 mm. The expression plasmid for the LC3-I mutant (LC3-IΔN) lacking the N-terminal subdomain (residues 1 to 29) was generated using the plasmid containing the full-length LC3-I as a template. LC3-IΔN protein was prepared according to the same protocol as that used for LC3-I. The purities of LC3-I and LC3-IΔN were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR samples contained 0.8–1.0 mm non-, 15N-, or 13C/15N-labeled LC3-I in 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.02 mm NaN3, and 10 or 100% D2O. The non-labeled LC3-IΔN was also concentrated to 0.8 mm. Prior to the NMR experiments, centrifugation at 15,000 × g was used to confirm that no aggregation was present in the samples. All of the NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on Bruker DMX500 and AV800 spectrometers. The assignments of 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of the backbone and the side chains were performed using a series of three-dimensional NMR experiments (38Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). For the structure calculations of LC3-I, distance restraints were collected from 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY three-dimensional experiments and two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY with 85-ms mixing times. Dihedral angle (ϕ) restraints obtained from a HNHA experiment were also used in the calculations. Two hours after dissolving LC3-I in 100% D2O, slowly exchanging amide protons were identified from the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. The steady-state heteronuclear NOE values were collected from spectra recorded with and without 1H saturation (39Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar, 40Kördel J. Skelton N.J. Akke M. Palmer A.I. Chazin W.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Titration experiments were performed by the addition of dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) at final concentrations of 0.01 to 30 mm, and the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was recorded at each titration point. The cross-peak perturbation (Δδ) was quantified by the following equation: Δδ = [(5Δ1H)2 + (Δ15N)2]1/2, where Δ1H and Δ15N are the changes in the chemical shifts along the 1H and 15N axes, respectively. The 1H photo-CIDNP difference spectrum was recorded on a Bruker DMX500 with a continuous-wave argon ion laser (Spectra Physics) (35Kaptein R. Dijkstra K. Nicolay K. Nature. 1978; 274: 293-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 41Maeda K. Lyon C.E. Berliner L.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 63: 199-201Google Scholar). Blue-green light (4 W) was introduced into the NMR tube through an optical fiber inside a coaxial Pyrex insert (Wilmad) dipped in the solution and was controlled by a mechanical shutter connected to the NMR spectrometer. The sample contained 0.8 mm LC3-I protein and 0.4 mm flavin mononucleotide as a photosensitizer in the NMR sample buffer. Light and dark free induction decays were alternately acquired with and without a 0.5-s light flash prior to a 90° RF pulse, respectively, and were integrated 16 times. The CIDNP difference spectrum was obtained by subtraction of the dark spectrum from the light spectrum. All NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe (42Delaglio F. Grzesiek S.

Structure Calculations—The solution structure of LC3-I was calculated with a distance geometry-simulated annealing protocol using X-PLOR software (44Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The structure calculations and NOE peak assignments were performed iteratively and manually. NOE cross-peak intensities were classified as strong, medium, weak, and very weak, and assigned to restraints of 1.8–2.8, 1.8–3.5, 1.8–5.0, and 1.8–6.0 Å, respectively, with appropriate pseudo atom corrections (45Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The hydrogen bonds were identified according to slow exchange of the amide proton with the solvent deuterium, and their partners were assigned on the basis of the early structure calculations. The hydrogen bond data were used as distance restraints of 2.3–3.3 and 1.3–2.3 Å for N-O and HN-O atom pairs, respectively, and were incorporated into the late stages of structure calculations. Finally, a simulated annealing protocol was applied using 12,000 steps at high temperature (1,000 K) and 8,000 steps for the cooling process. A total of 50 structures were calculated, and the 15 lowest energy structures were used for further calculation of the energy-minimized average structure. The quality of the obtained structure was analyzed with MOLMOL (46Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK-NMR (47Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab Binding Assay by Surface Plasmon Resonance—The interactions of LC3-I and its mutant with purified tubulin (Cytoskeleton) were studied using a BIACORE J biosensor (Biacore). The tubulin solution was centrifuged (50,000 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min to remove aggregated protein. Immediately after centrifugation, the tubulin was immobilized on a CM5 biosensor chip using an amine-coupling reagent (Biacore), and uncoupled tubulin was washed out with 5 mm NaOH. Binding assays were performed at 25 °C in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.0). Prior to use, LC3-I and LC3-IΔN solutions were passed through a 0.45-μm filter. For each protein, 180 μl of solutions at different concentrations (2.5 to 10 μm) were injected at 60 μl/min over immobilized tubulin and control flow cells. The control sensorgrams were subtracted from those obtained with tubulin. After each injection, regeneration was performed with 60 μl of HEPES (pH 7.0) containing 400 mm NaCl. Co-sedimentation Assay—Purified tubulin (Cytoskeleton) was dissolved in PEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, pH 6.6, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2) at a final concentration of 15 μm. LC3-I, LC3-IΔN, and tubulin solutions were centrifuged (50,000 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min, and their supernatants were used for experiments. For the polymerization of tubulin, GTP and paclitaxel (Sigma) were added to the tubulin solution at final concentrations of 1 mm and 50 μm, respectively, and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Following the incubation, the polymerized tubulin was diluted to 7.5 μm with PEM buffer. The LC3-I and LC3-IΔN solutions were added to the tubulin solution at final concentrations of 5 μm. After an additional incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, centrifugation (50,000 × g) was carried out at 37 °C for 20 min. The pellets were resuspended in the original volume of PEM buffer and the centrifugation procedure was repeated. The final pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. As a negative control, 400 mm NaCl was added into the LC3-I mixture solution after the tubulin polymerization reaction and processed as above. Structure Determination of LC3-I—To calculate the solution structure of LC3-I, a total of 2136 distance restraints and 55 dihedral restraints were obtained from the NMR spectra. The final simulated annealing calculation using these restraints gave 50 structures. Of these, the 15 structures with the lowest energy values were selected and used to calculate the energy-minimized average structure. In the selected 15 structures, there were no distance restraints with a violation value larger than 0.20 Å and no dihedral angle restraints with a violation larger than 2°. The energy-minimized average structure did not include residues in the disallowable regions of the Ramachandran plot. The ensemble of the 15 structures are presented in Fig. 1A, and the backbone heavy atoms of the well defined regions gave a r.m.s. deviation value of 0.59 ± 0.10 Å. The details of the structural statistics for LC3-I are shown in Table I. The solution structure of LC3-I includes four α-helices (H1, H2, H3, and H4) and a central β-sheet composed of four strands (S1, S2, S3, and S4) (Fig. 1B). Strands S1 and S4 are parallel and are located in the middle of the β-sheet. Strands S2 and S3 are antiparallel to S1 and S4, respectively. The β-sheet bends around the helix H3. The global conformation of LC3-I is very similar to those of the other Atg8 mammalian homologues, GABARAP and GATE-16 (27Paz Y. Elazar Z. Fass D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13363-13366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These structures are composed of a ubiquitin fold (i.e. helices H3 and H4 and a central β-sheet of LC3-I) and additional N-terminal α-helices (i.e. helices H1 and H2 of LC3-I), which we refer to as the C- and N-terminal subdomains, respectively (Fig. 1). The two subdomains are folded into a single globular conformation by hydrophobic cores. One of the cores is formed between the N- and C-terminal subdomains. The helix H2 protrudes from the C-terminal subdomain and is located along the surface of the central β-sheet. The helix H1 also covers the side chains of the residues, such as Ile-34 and Tyr-110 on the β-sheet (Fig. 1B). Thus, the two α-helices of the N-terminal subdomain cover the surface of the C-terminal subdomain and contribute to the formation of the hydrophobic environment. The NMR data indicated that the 1Hγ11 and 1Hδ1 resonances of Ile-34 showed an extreme upfield shift (–0.295 and –0.992 ppm, respectively) because of the close proximity of some aromatic rings derived from Phe-7, Phe-108, and Tyr-110. Another hydrophobic core is found in the C-terminal subdomain and is surrounded by helices H3 and H4 and the central β-sheet. Residues Ile-35 and Ile-67 are located on strand S1 and helix H3, respectively, and their side chains are directed toward the interior of the C-terminal subdomain (Fig. 1B). Like Ile-34 in the core between the two subdomains, the resonances of Ile-35 1Hδ1 and Ile-67 1Hδ1 are upfield-shifted (0.230 and 0.183 ppm, respectively) because of the ring current effects from the side chains of Phe-52, Phe-79, and Tyr-113 that participate in the core. Additional Information about the N-terminal Conformation—According to the LC3-I structure calculations, helices H1 and H2 are located on the surface of the central β-sheet in the C-terminal subdomain. In addition, the steady-state heteronuclear NOE values of the residues included in helix H1 are relatively high (the average value of the heteronuclear NOEs for the residues Phe-7 to Arg-10 was 0.75 ± 0.10) (Fig. 2A), which indicates low flexibility in solution. However, the conformation of helix H1 is less defined in the overall structure of LC3-I (Fig. 1A). To obtain additional information about the spatial orientation of helix H1, we carried out a photo-CIDNP approach that detects only specific amino acid residues (His, Trp, and Tyr) that are located on the protein surface. LC3-I has three histidine and four tyrosine residues but lacks tryptophan. A tyrosine residue, Tyr-110, is located on the central β-sheet of LC3-I and its side chain makes contact with helix H1 in the solution structure (Fig. 1B). Assuming that the less defined structure of helix H1 is caused by the flexibility of the region, the side chain of Tyr-110 should be accessible to photoexcited dye. Accordingly, a CIDNP effect can be detected for Tyr-110. The signal derived from this tyrosine res"

https://openalex.org/W2170268034,"Gram negative endotoxemia is associated with an intrinsic impairment of cardiomyocyte contraction, in part due to a reduction in myofilament Ca2+ responsiveness. Endotoxemic rat hearts show increased cardiac troponin I (cTnI) phosphorylation at serines 23 and 24, residues required for the protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent reduction of myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity after beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. To investigate the functional significance of increased TnI phosphorylation in endotoxemia, we studied the contractile effects of systemic bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment in transgenic mice (TG) with cardiac-specific replacement of cTnI by slow skeletal TnI (ssTnI, which lacks the PKA phosphorylation sites) and matched nontransgenic littermates (NTG) on a CD1 background. In wild-type CD1 mice treated with LPS (6 mg/kg ip), after 16-18 h there was a significant reduction in the maximum rates of left ventricular pressure development and pressure decline in isolated Langendorff-perfused hearts compared with saline-treated controls and a decrease in isolated myocyte unloaded sarcomere shortening from 6.1 +/- 0.2 to 3.9 +/- 0.2% (1 Hz, 32 degrees C, P<0.05). Similarly, in NTG myocytes, endotoxemia reduced myocyte shortening by 42% from 6.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.9 +/- 0.1% (P<0.05) with no change in intracellular Ca2+ transients. However, in the TG group, LPS reduced myocyte shortening by only 13% from 7.5 +/- 0.2 to 6.5 +/- 0.2% (P<0.05). LPS treatment significantly reduced the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol in NTG myocytes but not in TG myocytes, even though isoproterenol-induced increases in Ca2+ transient amplitude were similar in both groups. Only LPS-treated NTG hearts showed a significant increase in cTnI phosphorylation. Investigation of the sarcomere shortening-Ca2+ relationship in Triton-skinned cardiomyocytes revealed a significant reduction in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity after LPS treatment in NTG myocytes, an effect that was substantially attenuated in TG myocytes. In conclusion, the replacement of cTnI with ssTnI in the heart provides significant protection against endotoxemia-induced cardiac contractile dysfunction, most probably by preserving myofilament Ca2+ responsiveness due to prevention of phosphorylation of TnI at PKA-sensitive sites."

https://openalex.org/W1974109336,"In humans, the oxidatively induced DNA lesion 8-hydroxyguanine (8-oxoG) is removed from DNA by hOgg1, a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase that specifically incises 8-oxoG opposite cytosine. We analysed the expression of hOGG1 mRNA in 18 lung cancer and three normal cell lines. Although hOGG1 was overexpressed in most cell lines, 2/18 (11.1%) showed a lower hOGG1 mRNA and protein expression (approximately 80% decrease) relative to normal cell lines. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis showed increased levels of 8-oxoG in the two cell lines with the lowest hOGG1 mRNA expression. We examined the ability of nuclear and mitochondrial extracts to incise 8-oxoG lesion in cell lines H1650 and H226 expressing lower hOGG1 mRNA and H1915 and H1975 with higher than normal hOGG1 mRNA expression. Both nuclear and mitochondrial extracts from H1915 and H1975 cells were proficient in 8-oxoG removal. However, both cell lines with the lowest hOGG1 mRNA expression exhibited a severe reduction in 8-oxoG incision in both nuclear and mitochondrial extracts. Under-expression of hOGG1 mRNA and hOgg1 protein was associated with a decrease in mitochondrial DNA repair in response to oxidative damaging agents. These results provide evidence for defective incision of 8-oxoG in both nuclear and mitochondria of H1650 and H226 lung cancer cell lines. These results may implicate 8-oxoG repair defects in certain lung cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1970554397,"Germline mutations of CDKN2A that affect the p16INK4a transcript have been identified in numerous melanoma pedigrees worldwide. In the UK, over 50% of pedigrees with three or more cases of melanoma have been found to carry mutations of CDKN2A. Mutations that affect p14ARF exon 1beta exclusively are very rare. This has led to the suggestion that it is p16INK4a and not p14ARF that plays the critical role in melanoma predisposition. We report the identification of a cluster of five different germline mutations at the p14ARF exon 1beta splice donor site in melanoma pedigrees. All the five splice site variants showed evidence of being causal mutations. Three of the variants were demonstrated to result in aberrant splicing of the p14ARF mRNA, confirming their role in melanoma predisposition. No other point mutations were identified in the coding region of p14ARF. The p14ARF transcript of CDKN2A is clearly important in disease predisposition in a subset of melanoma pedigrees. Curiously, the only mutations so far reported to affect p14ARF exon 1beta exclusively have been knockout mutations. Further investigation into the spectrum of mutations observed in this gene may help clarify the exact role of p14ARF in melanoma predisposition."

Increasing reports indicate that the lineage restriction of adult mesenchymal stem cells may be less established than previously believed, and stem cell-based therapeutics await the establishment of an efficient protocol capable of achieving a prescribed phenotype differentiation. We have investigated how adult mouse bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs) are guided to neurogenic and osteogenic phenotypes. Naïve BMSCs were found surprisingly active in expression of a wide range of mRNAs and proteins, including those normally reported in terminally differentiated neuronal cells and osteoblasts. The naïve BMSCs were found to exhibit voltage-dependent membrane currents similar to the neuronally guided BMSCs, although with smaller amplitudes. Once BMSCs were exposed to the osteogenic culture condition, the neuronal characteristics quickly disappeared. Our data suggest that the loss of discordant phenotypes during BMSC differentiation cannot be explained by the selection and elimination of unfit cells from the whole BMSC population. The percent ratio of live to dead BMSCs examined did not change during the first 8–10 days in either neurogenic or osteogenic differentiation media, and cell detachment was estimated at <1%. However, during this period, bone-associated extracellular matrix genes were selectively down-regulated in neuronally guided BMSCs.

https://openalex.org/W2019761372,"The downstream of kinase (Dok) family of adapter proteins consists of at least five members structurally characterized by an NH2-terminal tandem of conserved pleckstrin homology and phosphotyrosine binding domains linked to a unique COOH-terminal region. To determine the role of the novel adapter protein Dok-4 in endothelial cells, we first investigated the cell localization of Dok-4. Most surprisingly, immunofluorescence microscopy, cell fractionation studies, and studies with enhanced green fluorescent protein chimeras showed that wild type Dok-4 (Dok-4-WT) specifically localized in mitochondria. An NH2-terminal deletion mutant of Dok-4 (Dok-4-(ΔN11-29)), which lacks the mitochondrial targeting sequence, could not accumulate in mitochondria. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed an interaction of c-Src with Dok-4-WT in endothelial cells. Most interestingly, overexpression of Dok-4-WT, but not Dok-4-(ΔN1-99), increased mitochondrial c-Src expression, whereas knock-down of endogenous Dok-4 with a small interfering RNA vector greatly inhibited mitochondrial localization of c-Src, suggesting a unique function for Dok-4 as an anchoring protein for c-Src in mitochondria. Dok-4-WT significantly decreased 39-kDa subunit complex I expression. PP2, a specific Src kinase inhibitor, prevented the Dok-4-mediated complex I decrease, suggesting the involvement of Src kinase in regulation of complex I expression. Dok-4-WT enhanced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, supporting the functional relevance of a Dok-4-Src-complex I/ROS signaling pathway in mitochondria. Finally, Dok-4 enhanced TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation, whereas this was inhibited by transfection with Dok-4 small interfering RNA. In addition, Dok-4-induced NF-κB activation was also inhibited by transfection of a dominant negative form of c-Src. These data suggest a role for mitochondrial Dok-4 as an anchoring molecule for the tyrosine kinase c-Src, and in turn as a regulator of TNF-α-mediated ROS production and NF-κB activation.

Most interestingly, overexpression of Dok-4-WT, but not Dok-4-(ΔN1-99), increased mitochondrial c-Src expression, whereas knock-down of endogenous Dok-4 with a small interfering RNA vector greatly inhibited mitochondrial localization of c-Src, suggesting a unique function for Dok-4 as an anchoring protein for c-Src in mitochondria. Dok-4-WT significantly decreased 39-kDa subunit complex I expression. PP2, a specific Src kinase inhibitor, prevented the Dok-4-mediated complex I decrease, suggesting the involvement of Src kinase in regulation of complex I expression. Dok-4-WT enhanced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, supporting the functional relevance of a Dok-4-Src-complex I/ROS signaling pathway in mitochondria. Finally, Dok-4 enhanced TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation, whereas this was inhibited by transfection with Dok-4 small interfering RNA. In addition, Dok-4-induced NF-κB activation was also inhibited by transfection of a dominant negative form of c-Src. These data suggest a role for mitochondrial Dok-4 as an anchoring molecule for the tyrosine kinase c-Src, and in turn as a regulator of TNF-α-mediated ROS production and NF-κB activation. The intracellular signaling network triggered by binding of growth factors and cytokines to cellular surface receptors is rigorously regulated in cells and often involves recruitment of adapter molecules to transmembrane receptors (1Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4139-4140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar).

The previously identified Dok members, p62 Dok (Dok-1), Dok-2 (Dok-R), and Dok-3, are predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells (3Lemay S. Davidson D. Latour S. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2743-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although these three Doks have similar domains to IRSs, they can be distinguished from the IRS family based on sequence homology and functional interactions. Hematopoietic Dok molecules are prominent substrates of the Src and Abl tyrosine kinases. Upon tyrosine phosphorylation, they acquire the ability to bind SH2 domain-containing molecules such as RasGAP, Csk, and Nck (3Lemay S. Davidson D. Latour S. Veillette A. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) identified two novel Dok-like molecules, Dok-4 and Dok-5, as partners and substrates for the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret. Whereas Dok-5 appears concentrated in the central nervous system, Dok-4 seems most highly expressed in epithelial and endothelial cells (4Bedirian A. Baldwin C. Abe J. Takano T. Lemay S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19335-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Grimm J. Sachs M. Britsch S. Di Cesare S. Schwarz-Romond T. Alitalo K. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We have reported (4Bedirian A. Baldwin C. Abe J. Takano T. Lemay S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19335-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that a significant proportion of Dok-4 is constitutively associated with the cell membrane and that it can serve as a substrate for tyrosine kinases of the Src family. However, because Dok-4 lacks consensus binding sites for known SH2 domains, its exact function has been difficult to define. We found that Dok-4 inhibited activation of the Erk substrate Elk-1 by Ret and by the Src kinase Fyn in epithelial cells. On the other hand, by using different approaches and cellular systems, Grimm et al. (6Grimm J. Sachs M. Britsch S. Di Cesare S. Schwarz-Romond T. Alitalo K. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and Cai et al. (7Cai D. Dhe-Paganon S. Melendez P.A. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25323-25330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) have suggested a role for Dok-4 in enhanced Erk activation. Although it has been reported that Dok-4 is strongly expressed in vascular endothelium (6Grimm J. Sachs M. Britsch S. Di Cesare S. Schwarz-Romond T. Alitalo K. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), its function within this context remains unexplored. The Src family of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases plays critical roles in a variety of cellular signal transduction pathways, regulating such diverse processes as cell division, motility, adhesion, angiogenesis, and survival. Although c-Src protein kinase does not possess any mitochondrial targeting sequence, several recent studies (8Salvi M. Brunati A.M. Bordin L. La Rocca N. Clari G. Toninello A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Miyazaki T. Neff L. Tanaka S. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) have shown that c-Src exists not only in the cytoplasm but also in mitochondria. Miyazaki et al. (9Miyazaki T. Neff L. Tanaka S. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) have reported that c-Src associates with cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV subunit II (Ccox)) and activates Ccox activity in osteoclasts. However, the physiological role of mitochondrial c-Src in endothelial cells remains unclear. It has been reported that the PH domains of IRS and Dok proteins bind phospholipids and as such serve as membrane targeting domains. In addition, since Tamir et al. (10Tamir I. Stolpa J.C. Helgason C.D. Nakamura K. Bruhns P. Daeron M. Cambier J.C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) reported that the binding of Dok-1 to plasma membrane is due to the association of the PTB domain of Dok-1 with tyrosine-phosphorylated SH2-containing 5-inositol phosphatase, both the PH and PTB domains of Dok family proteins may have crucial roles in determining cellular localization. In fact, we recently reported that in COS, HEK293, and epithelial cells, overexpressed Dok-4 localized to the cell membrane in a PH and PTB domain-dependent manner (4Bedirian A. Baldwin C. Abe J. Takano T. Lemay S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19335-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, we noted that Dok-4 localized in an as yet undefined punctate cytoplasmic compartment. In the current study, while examining the localization of Dok-4 in endothelial cells, we found that the punctate distribution of Dok-4 in cytosol represented mitochondrial localization. In addition, we found that the NH2-terminal region of Dok-4 contains a putative novel mitochondrial targeting sequence within the previously described PH domain, and that both the NH2-terminal region and PTB domain are critical for mitochondrial localization. Furthermore, overexpression of Dok-4 recruits Src to mitochondria and increases TNF-α-induced ROS generation and NF-κB activation. Because the Src kinase family does not possess a mitochondrial targeting sequence, this suggests that Dok-4 serves as the anchoring protein of Src kinase family in mitochondria. Overexpression of Dok-4 enhanced TNF-α-mediated ROS production as well as NF-κB activation in endothelial cells. In addition, a knock-down of Dok-4 by siRNA significantly inhibited this NF-κB activation, suggesting a role for endogenous Dok-4 expression on mitochondria-mediated inflammatory responses in endothelial cells. Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were purchased from Clonetics Corp. and maintained in Medium 199 (Cellgro) as described previously (11Osawa M. Itoh S. Ohta S. Huang Q. Berk B.C.

Bovine lung microvascular endothelial cells (BLMEC) at passage 3-8 were grown in MCDB-131 media supplemented with 10% FBS, heparin (15,300 units/liter, Sigma), hydrocortisone (2.76 μmol/liter, Sigma), bovine pituitary extract, epidermal growth factor (1.64 nmol/liter, Sigma), l-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 68.6 mol/liter streptomycin) in flasks pre-coated with 2% gelatin as described previously (12Pi X. Yan C. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We performed our experiments at 70-80% subconfluent condition. Plasmids—The expression constructs of wild type and mutant Dok-4 fused to either Myc tag (in pcDNA3.1 myc-His vector, Invitrogen) or EGFP (in pEGFP-N1, Clontech) were described previously (4Bedirian A. Baldwin C. Abe J. Takano T. Lemay S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19335-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal domain deleted mutant (deletion of amino acids 1-99 and 11-29 in wild type Dok-4, Dok-4(ΔN1-99), and -(ΔN11-29), respectively), PTB domain deleted mutant (deletion of amino acids 100-233 in wild type Dok-4 and Dok-4-(Δ100-233)), and COOH-terminal domain deleted mutant (deletion of amino acids 234-325 in wild type Dok-4 and Dok-4Δ-(C234-325)) in Dok-4 were generated by PCR. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. For the visualization of mitochondrial localization, cells were transfected with mitochondrial targeting sequence from subunit VIII of human cytochrome c oxidase fused with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (Mito-EYFP, Clontech). High Transfection Efficiency of siRNA, Dok-4 WT, and Mutants in BAECs and BLMECs and Low Transfection Efficiency of Dok-4 WT and Dok-4-(ΔN1-99) in BAECs—Subconfluent BAECs and BLMECs in 35-mm dishes were washed twice with serum-free OPTI medium (Invitrogen). For high efficiency transfection in BAECs and BLMECs, we performed two consecutive transfections with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 1-4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 was mixed with 500 μl of serum-free OPTI medium. After 20 min, 0.5-2 μg of Dok-4 siRNA or control siRNA was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. BLMECs in 2 ml of serum-free OPTI medium were treated with this mixture. After 3 h of incubation, the medium was changed to MCDB-131 with 10% FBS, and the cells were cultured for 24 h. Then we transfected BLMECs again with the same serum-free OPTI medium containing siRNA/Lipofectamine 2000 mixture for 3 h followed again by MCDB-131 medium with 10% FBS for another 24 h. For transfection of Dok-4 WT and mutant constructs, 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 was mixed with 500 μl of serum-free OPTI medium. After 20 min, 3 μg of Dok-4 WT or mutant constructs were added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. BAECs or BLMECs in 2 ml of serum-free OPTI medium were treated with this mixture. After 3 h of incubation, the medium was changed to MCDB-131 media with 10% FBS, and the cells were cultured for 6 h. Then we transfected BAECs or BLMECs again with same serum-free OPTI medium containing Dok-4 WT or mutants/Lipofectamine 2000 mixture for 1.5 h, and after 1.5 h of incubation, the medium was changed to MCDB-131 media with 10% FBS, and cells were cultured for 24 h. Under these conditions (high transfection efficiency), 80-90% of the BLMECs were transfected (data not shown), and the Dok-4 expression of the culture was decreased by 70% in BLMECs (Fig. 3E). In Fig. 5 we intentionally transfected Dok-4 WT and Dok-4-(ΔN1-99) at low transfection efficiency (30-40%) to compare directly the Dok-4-transfected BAECs with nontransfected cells as we described previously (13Osawa M. Masuda M. Kusano K. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). BAECs were washed and placed in 1 ml of serum-free OPTI medium as above. They were then treated with Dok-4 WT and mutant constructs (1 μg/ml) in the OPTI mixture for 3 h, and after 3 h of incubation, the medium was changed to M199 media with 10% FBS, and cells were cultured for 24 h.Fig. 5Dok-4 enhances TNF-α-mediated ROS production. 24 h after transfection with Dok-4 WT EGFP vector or Dok-4-(ΔN1-99)-EGFP vector, BAECs were stimulated with (B) or without (A) TNF-α (15 ng/ml) for 1 h. The medium was changed to pre-warmed culture medium containing 100 nm of Reduced Mito-Tracker Red probe (CM-H2XRos, purchased form Molecular Probes) for 20 min. This reduced form of the probe is nonfluorescent until it is oxidized by ROS. When probe is oxidized by ROS, it then becomes fluorescent. The oxidized product is bound to thiol groups and proteins within the mitochondria. After 20 min, the medium was carefully removed and replaced by pre-warmed 3.7% formaldehyde-containing serum. The top panel shows a green signal from EGFP-tagged Dok-4 WT (A and B) and Dok-4-(ΔN1-99) (C), whereas the middle and bottom panels show the corresponding fields with a red fluorescent signal from CM-H2XRos under normal (middle) and bright field exposure (bottom) to show the cell density. Arrows indicate EGFP-positive cells. Asterisk indicates a cell with strong overexpression of EGFP signal (A) where no significant increase of CM-H2XRos signal was detected compared with nontransfected cells. D-F, changes in cell fluorescence. The intensity of red fluorescence (from Reduced Mito-Tracker Red Probe) in Dok-4 WT (D and E) and Dok-4-(ΔN1-99) (F)-transfected cells was compared with that found in nontransfected cells in same optical field. Results were normalized by arbitrarily setting the fluorescence of one of the nontransfected cells from the same field to 1.0. Cell fluorescence was quantified in five random fields (one field contained 15-30 cells), and the average fluorescence of transfected and nontransfected cells was calculated. The data presented combines six to eight experiments performed on different days (shown is the mean ± S.D., *, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RNA Interference—RNA interference construct was created using pSHAG (kindly provided by Greg Hannon, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories). Briefly, oligonucleotides carrying short RNA hairpins targeted to conserved regions of human (GenBank™ accession number AF466369) and mouse (BC004705) Dok-4 were annealed and cloned into BseRI-BamHI-cut pSHAG just downstream of the U6 promoter. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for the Dok-4 siRNA construction were as follows: oligonucleotides A (5′-TGG ATG TCC CAG AGG TAG ATG TTC TCG TGA AGC TTG ATG AGA ATA TCT ATC TCT GGG ACA TTC ACA ATT TTT T-3′) and B (5′-GAT CAA AAA ATT GTG AAT GTC CCA GAG ATA GAT ATT CTC ATC AAG CTT CAC GAG AAC ATC TAC CTC TGG GAC ATC CAC G-3′).

We used GFP siRNA for a control as described previously (14Hamar P. Song E. Kokeny G. Chen A. Ouyang N. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mitochondrial Preparation—Mitochondria fraction in BAECs was purified with ApoAlert cell fractionation kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—After treatment with reagents, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer as described previously (16Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously with mouse anti-Myc (Invitrogen) (17Abe J. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16586-16590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (16Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In brief, the blots were incubated for 4 h at room temperature with the anti-Dok-4 antibody (4Bedirian A. Baldwin C. Abe J. Takano T. Lemay S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19335-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), anti-Myc (Invitrogen), anti-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-complex I 39-kDa subunit (Molecular Probe), anti-caveolin (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-PCNA (Pharmingen), anti-GM130 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Bip (Affinity BioReagents), anti-α-tubulin (Clone B5-1-2, Sigma), or anti-cytochrome c oxidase (Molecular Probes) antibody, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). PathDetect in Vivo Signal Transduction Pathway Reporting System—NF-κB and AP-1 activity was assayed by using the PathDetect Signal transduction Pathway trans-Reporting Systems (Stratagene) as described previously (18Lerner-Marmarosh N. Yoshizumi M. Che W. Surapisitchat J. Kawakatsu H. Akaike M. Ding B. Huang Q. Yan C. Berk B.C. Abe J.I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Elk-1 activity was assayed by using the PathDetect Signal Transduction Pathway trans-Reporting Systems (Stratagene). The pRL-TK Renilla luciferase vector was used for normalization of transfection. Cells were co-transfected with pNF-κB-Luc reporter plasmid and pRL-TK with other plasmids as indicated in the figures. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy Analysis—Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min followed by permeabilization with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 15 min. After fixation and permeabilization of the cells, they were incubated with 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories) and treated with anti-Dok-4 antibody or anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) for 45 min at room temperature. Secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 546 dye against rabbit IgG or 488 dye against mouse IgG1 were purchased from Molecular Probes. To detect mitochondria distribution, we transfected the cells with mito-EYFP vector (Clontech) (containing targeting sequence from subunit VIII of cytochrome c oxidase). Images were observed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Fluoview; Olympus) with a LUMPlanFl60× lens or a fluorescence microscope (Axiophot; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) equipped with a CCD camera and an Acroplan Water 60×W lens. Quantification of the overlay image was done using Photoshop 7.0 program. Mitochondria-reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Detection, CM-H2XRos Staining—ROS production by mitochondria was monitored by using the Reduced MitoTracker Red CM-H2XRos staining (Molecular Probes). The reduced version of MitoTracker Red CM-H2XRos does not fluoresce until entering actively respiring cells, where it is oxidized by ROS to a red fluorescent compound, which is sequestered in the mitochondria (19Ludovico P. Rodrigues F. Almeida A. Silva M.T. Barrientos A. Corte-Real M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2598-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). After 24 h of transfection with EGFP-tagged wild type (Dok-4 WT) and NH2-terminal domain deletion mutant (Dok-4Δ-(N1-99)) in BAECs, cells were stimulated with TNF-α for 1 h. The medium was changed to pre-warmed culture medium containing 100 nm of Reduced Mito-Tracker Red (CM-H2XRos, purchased from Molecular Probes) for 20 min. After 20 min, the medium was carefully removed and replaced with pre-warmed 3.7% formaldehyde containing serum. ROS Measurement by Dihydroethidium (DHE)—Intracellular ROS were also measured using the redox-sensitive dye DHE (Molecular Probes). DHE enters the cell and is oxidized by ROS, particularly superoxide (O2−·), to become ethidium that emits red fluorescence. Ethidium intercalates with the DNA of the cell, further amplifying fluorescence. Therefore, the fluorescence in the nuclear region is indicative of ROS generation and was selected as the region of interest for data analysis (20Becker L.B. vanden Hoek T.L. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2240-H2246PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured endothelial cells were loaded with 10 μm dihydroethidium in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm NaHCO3, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1.2 mm Na2SO4, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, cells were washed three times with indicator-free HEPES buffer and left in the last washing buffer for imaging studies. Single-cell imaging was taken by a fluorescent microscope (TILL Photonics LLC) using Nikon TE2000s inverted microscope with a 40× oil objective. The cells was illuminated at 515 nm, and the emitted fluorescence was collected between 580 and 630 nm. Fluorescent images from 12-15 cells were taken every minute in a 60-min time course in each set of experiments. At the end of each experiment, mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and III inhibitors rotenone and antimycin A (Sigma) were added to induce maximal ROS production resulting in maximal DHE fluorescence. Ccox Activity—Ccox activity of cell lysates was measured as cyanide-sensitive oxidation of reduced cytochrome c, spectrophotometrically at 550 nm as described previously (21Ramachandran A. Ceaser E. Darley-Usmar V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are reported as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed with the StatView 4.0 package (ABACUS Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Differences were analyzed with a one-way or a two-way repeated measure analysis of variance as appropriate, followed by Schéffe's correction for multiple comparisons. p values less than 0.05 are indicated by * and less than 0.01 by ** (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8).Fig. 7Dok-4 enhances TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation via ROS production.

To control for transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with a fixed amount of pRL-TK control vector (A and B). After 12 h of transfection, BAECs were treated with or without MnTMPyP at indicated concentration (B), and after 24 h of transfection BAECs were treated with vehicle or TNF-α (10 ng/ml) (A and B). After 16 h of TNF-α stimulation, luciferase NF-κB transcriptional activity was assayed using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System. Firefly luciferase luminescence was normalized to co-transfected Renilla luciferase activity as described under “Materials and Methods.” Results are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments (mean ± S.D. **, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05). C, BAECs were transfected with pAP-1Luc-plasmid (left) or pFA2-Elk-1 and pFR-Luc vector (right) with empty or Dok-4 WT vector, and after 24 h of transfection BAECs were treated with vehicle or TNF-α (10 ng/ml).

Results are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments (*, p < 0.05). C, scheme of the role of mitochondria Dok-4/c-Src in TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation. Induction of Dok-4 recruits cytosolic c-Src in mitochondria to associate with Dok-4 and inhibits complex I expression via increasing Src kinase activity and then the reduction of complex I accelerates TNF-α-mediated mitochondria-ROS production and leads to NF-κB activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dok-4 Is Localized in Mitochondria through Its NH2-terminal Region and PTB Domain in Endothelial Cells—To determine the intracellular localization of Dok-4 in endothelial cells, we performed immunostaining analysis by using anti-DOK-4 antibody in BAECs.

https://openalex.org/W2107009082,"We examined the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARG) locus in an attempt to identify expressed sequence tags and/or conserved non-coding sequences in the intron sequences containing open reading frames and potentially able to encode new proteins. We identified a new PPARG transcript, defined γORF4, which harbors a readthrough in intron 4. The expected translated protein lacks the ligand-binding domain encoded by exons 5 and 6. We identified the transcript in human tumor cell lines and tissues, synthesized the cDNA, and cloned it in expression vectors. Using transient transfections, we found that γORF4 cDNA is translated into a predominantly nuclear protein that does not transactivate a reporter gene. Moreover, the isoform is dominant negative versus PPARγ. Interestingly, γORF4 was expressed in vivo in a series of sporadic colorectal cancers. In some cases, it was expressed, albeit at lower levels, also in the mucosa adjacent to the tumors, suggesting that it may be related to tumorigenesis. A tumorigenic effect of γORF4 is in line with our finding that γORF4 has not only lost the capacity to restrain cell growth but has acquired the potential to stimulate it. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that γORF4 is expressed in vivo, that it has lost some PPARγ properties, and that it affects PPARγ functioning. The ability to counteract PPARγ suggests that γORF4 plays a role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancers. We examined the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARG) locus in an attempt to identify expressed sequence tags and/or conserved non-coding sequences in the intron sequences containing open reading frames and potentially able to encode new proteins. We identified a new PPARG transcript, defined γORF4, which harbors a readthrough in intron 4. The expected translated protein lacks the ligand-binding domain encoded by exons 5 and 6. We identified the transcript in human tumor cell lines and tissues, synthesized the cDNA, and cloned it in expression vectors. Using transient transfections, we found that γORF4 cDNA is translated into a predominantly nuclear protein that does not transactivate a reporter gene. Moreover, the isoform is dominant negative versus PPARγ. Interestingly, γORF4 was expressed in vivo in a series of sporadic colorectal cancers. In some cases, it was expressed, albeit at lower levels, also in the mucosa adjacent to the tumors, suggesting that it may be related to tumorigenesis. A tumorigenic effect of γORF4 is in line with our finding that γORF4 has not only lost the capacity to restrain cell growth but has acquired the potential to stimulate it. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that γORF4 is expressed in vivo, that it has lost some PPARγ properties, and that it affects PPARγ functioning. The ability to counteract PPARγ suggests that γORF4 plays a role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancers. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR 1The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; EST, expressed sequence tags; PPIA, peptidyl propylyl isomerase A, cyclophilin A; RT, reverse transcriptase; PPRE, peroxisome proliferator-response element; TK, thymidine-kinase; Luc, luciferase; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; HA, hemagglutinin. α, β/δ, and γ isoforms) are nuclear hormone receptors that belong to a superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors (1Francis G.A. Fayard E. Picard F. Auwerx J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). PPARG is located on chromosome 3p25.2. It spans about 100 kb and comprises six coding exons that are translated into the protein domains common to all PPAR isoforms and nuclear receptors (1Francis G.A. Fayard E. Picard F. Auwerx J. Annu.

Analysis of the PPARG 5′-flanking region has identified at least four promoters that are alternatively used to produce two PPARγ protein species, γ1 and γ2 (3Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M. Fruchart J.-C. Deeb S. Vidal-Puig A. Flier J. Briggs M.R. Staels B. Vidal H. Auwerx J. J. Biol.

Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M. Fruchart J.-C. Deeb S. Vidal-Puig A. Flier J. Briggs M.R. Staels B. Vidal H. Auwerx J. J. Biol.

The sequences transcribed from the other promoters are present as untranslated regions at the 5′-end of the mRNAs; thus, γ3 and γ4 transcripts have the same coding potential as γ1 (4Fajas L.

Similar differential promoter usage, with no changes in the protein species produced, has been reported for the α (6Chew C.H. Samian M.R. Najimudin N. Tengku-Muhammad T.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and β/δ isoforms (7Larsen L.K. Amri E.Z. Mandrup S. Pacot C. Kristiansen K. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 767-775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PPARs also undergo diverse genomic rearrangements that result in distinct transcripts. PPARG undergoes a gene translocation event that produces a PAX8-PPARG chimeric, the product of which has been detected thus far only in thyroid follicular tumors (8Kroll T.G. Sarraf P. Pecciarini L. Chen C.J. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. Fletcher J.A. Science. 2000; 289: 1357-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar); PPARA undergoes an exon-skipping mechanism that generates alternatively spliced products in cell lines and tissues (9Gervois P. Pineda Torra I. Chinetti G. Grotzinger T. Dubois G. Fruchart J.-C. Najib-Fruchart J. Leitersdorf E. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1535-1549PubMed Google Scholar). Somatic loss-of-function PPARG mutations have also been reported in sporadic colorectal cancers (10Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W. Wrigth H.M. Kum J.B. Aaltonen L.A. De la Chapaelle A. Spiegelman B.M. Eng C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), suggesting that any event that hampers PPARγ activity causes loss of the differentiated phenotype. In fact, PPARγ plays a pivotal role in adipocyte and epithelial cell differentiation as well as in the regulation of energy metabolism (11Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Its prodifferentiation and antiproliferative effect occurs in several cell types. Specifically, exposure to PPARγ ligands inhibits the growth of various human cancer cell lines in vitro, of tumors in vivo, and of tumors transplanted into nude mice (12Michalik L. Desvergne B.

These data support the notion that PPARG exerts a protective function in cancer progression (18Sarraf P. Mueller E. Jones D. King F.J. DeAngelo D.J. Partridge J.B. Holden S.A. Chen L.B. Singer S.

Differently, whether or not PPARγ is a tumor-promoting factor in vivo remains to be established (19Lefebvre A.M. Chen I. Desreumaux P. Najib J. Fruchart J.-C. Geboes K. Briggs M. Heyman R. Auwerx J.

Alternative splicing is a post-transcriptional mechanism whereby proteins that exert distinct functions are generated from a single transcript (23Shin C. Manley J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Bio. 2004; 9: 727-738Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 24Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar, 25Maniatis T. Tasic B. Nature. 2002; 418: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). From 30 to 60% of human genes are thought to undergo this regulatory mechanism that results in protein diversity (25Maniatis T. Tasic B. Nature. 2002; 418: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). It appears to function during embryogenesis as in the case of sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster (26Schutt T. Nothinger R. Development. 2000; 127: 667-677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in the activation of various Hox genes by which different proteins are generated in different tissues at different developmental stages (27Oudejans C.B. Pannese M. Simeone A. Meijer C.J. Boncinelli E. Development. 1990; 108: 471-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, alternative splicing has also been implicated in apoptosis (23Shin C.

Krainer A.R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 4: 285-298Crossref Scopus (1761) Google Scholar), and in tumorigenesis (Refs. 30Sigalas I. Calvert A.H. Andersen J. Neal D.E. Lunec J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 31Maier B. Gluba W. Bernier B. Turner T. Mohammad K. Guise T. Sutherland A. Thorner M. Scrable H.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8535-8544Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and references therein). The aim of our study was to determine whether or not alternative splicing causes PPARγ loss-of-function. Using computer analysis, we identified a new PPARG transcript (henceforth “γORF4”) that contains a readthrough in intron 4. The expected protein lacks the whole ligand-binding domain. We identified γORF4 in tumor tissues and cell lines, synthesized the cDNA, and cloned it in expression vectors. Using transient transfection experiments, we demonstrate that γORF4 cDNA is translated into a predominantly nuclear protein. Despite its subcellular localization, the new isoform does not transactivate a reporter gene and is dominant negative toward PPARγ. Interestingly, we found that γORF4 is expressed in vivo in a series of sporadic colorectal cancers, and in some cases, at low levels, in the mucosa adjacent to the tumors, suggesting that it may be related to tumorigenesis. By colony-forming assay and BrdUrd incorporation experiments, we showed that the isoform has not only lost the capacity of the wild-type receptor to restrain cell growth but has acquired the potential to stimulate cell growth. These data demonstrated that γORF4 has lost some properties of PPARγ and that it interferes with its function. The ability to counteract PPARγ suggests that γORF4 plays a role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancers. Tissue Samples—We collected 25 tissue samples from patients affected by colorectal cancer who underwent surgery at the “Fatebenefratelli” Hospital, Benevento, Italy. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. The sporadic origin of the tumors was determined from clinical, imaging, and laboratory data as well as from the personal and familial history, which ruled out any disorder of the large intestine in the relatives of the proband up to the second degree. All patients were at their first surgery after the initial diagnosis. No patient was diabetic or had taken non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on a regular basis for inflammatory diseases of the large bowel. Tumor samples were obtained during surgery, immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored until time of analysis. Samples of intestinal mucosa were obtained from the adjacent tissue and processed in parallel as internal controls of the assays. The specimens were analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry to verify correct pathological staging. All tumors were stages 2-4 according to Broder's classification, and all were moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas that infiltrated the underlying lamina and the muscle layers. Local and regional nodes were involved in most cases. 6 out of 25 patients had liver metastases; only in one case were metastases detected in the lung. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR Assay—RNA was extracted from tissues and cell lines by Trizol™ (Invitrogen). Random primed double-strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III (Invitrogen). The specificity of each oligonucleotide pair used was verified with he BLAST program. The amplification conditions for each primer pair were experimentally determined. From 20 to 40 amplification cycles were run to avoid saturating conditions. For semiquantitative analysis, amplification was performed at 25, 30, and 35 cycles. The intensity of the amplified bands was quantified by densitometry and referred to that obtained with peptidyl propylyl isomerase A (PPIA, cyclophilin A). PCR products were sequenced with the BigDye reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) and a 3100 ABI Prism automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). We used the following the primer sequences in the RT-PCR analysis: PPAR-β/δ forward, 5′-AGC TGC AGA TGG GCT GTG AT-3′, and reverse, 5′-ACG CTG ATC TCG TTG TAG GG-3′; β-catenin forward, 5′-CCA GCG TGG ACA ATG GCT AC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGA GCT CGA GAG TCA TTG CAT AC-3′; PPARγ (exons 1-6) forward, 5′-ATG ACC ATG GTT GAC ACA GAG ATG C-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTA GTA CAA GTC CTT GTA GAT CT-3′; γORF4 forward, 5′-GAA GCC AAC ACT AAA CCA CA-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAA CCC AAA ACA ACT TCC CG-3′; cyclophilin A forward, 5′-GGA GAA ATT TGA AGA TGA GAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTG ATC TTC TTG CTG GTC TT-3′. Ovarian carcinoma RNAs samples were obtained from the National Cancer Institute Fondazione Pascale (Naples, Italy). Western Blot, Dot Blot, and Antibodies—Protein extracts were obtained from control and tumor tissues after homogenization at 4 °C in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), using an Ultra-Turrax (IKA, Labortechnik). Extracts were also prepared from cells in culture in the same buffer. Specimens from normal colonic mucosa were obtained from 10 healthy patients subjected to colon biopsy during diagnostic screening. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 50-70 μg of protein extracts were run on a 10-12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Alternatively, the extracts were spotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for dot blot analysis. Immunodetection was performed with the primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, and the signals were revealed with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). For displacement experiments, a blocking peptide directed against γORF4-specific amino acids was added to the reaction mixtures containing antibody-proteins at increasing concentrations as indicated. Protein loading was normalized by incubating the same filters with anti-β-actin antibody, and the band intensity was quantified by densitometry (Bio-Rad). The antibodies used in Western blot and dot blot analysis were: PPARγ (C terminus) sc-7273 and HA probe sc-805 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); PPARβ/δ PAI-823 (Affinity Bio Reagents); β-catenin C19220-050 (BD Transduction Laboratories); FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody A5441 and β-actin A1978 (Sigma), V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Expression Vectors—PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 and γORF4 cDNAs were cloned in pcDNA3 expression vectors (Invitrogen) in-frame with 5′-end HA or FLAG epitopes or in the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO in-frame with the V5 and His epitopes at the 3′-end. The various cDNAs were obtained by RT-PCR starting from total RNA extracted from tumor tissues. The right insertion was determined by restriction map, and the correct sequence was determined by automated DNA sequencing of the plasmids. Cell Lines, Transient Transfections, and Transactivation Assays—Cos7, NIH-3T3, and Caco2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Cos7 and Caco2 cells were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and NIH-3T3 cells were transfected by FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Where indicated, 16 h after transfection, troglitazone (Cayman Chemical) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide or the vehicle alone was added at the indicated concentrations and incubated for a further 24 h. All transfections were carried out with a luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional control of the herpes simplex thymidine-kinase (TK) promoter fused to three copies of the peroxisome proliferator-response element (PPRE) derived from the acyl-CoA oxidase gene (PPRE-TK-Luc). Expression vectors containing 5′- or 3′-tagged PPARγcDNA were transfected alone or in combination. In all cases, 0.2 μg of the CMV-β-galactosidase-containing plasmid were cotransfected to normalize for transfection efficiency. 48 h later, luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were determined on cell extracts, and luciferase was normalized to β-galactosidase. All experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least five times. Data are given as mean ± S.E. Differences between controls and the variants were assessed by Student's t test (two tailed, unpaired); a p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Colony-forming Efficiency Assay—The day after seeding, NIH-3T3 cells (105 cells/6-well plate) were transfected with 2 μg of the empty vector or the PPARγ- and γORF4 cDNAs-containing plasmids by FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The cells were exposed to the FuGENE-DNA complexes for 16-20 h and then split 1:10 in 100-mm plates in the G418 selection medium (600 μg/ml Geneticin, Invitrogen). After 15 days, the plates were stained with crystal violet. Colony-forming efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of colonies obtained on plates transfected with the various PPARγ constructs by that obtained with the empty vector (33Peverali F.A. Ramqvist T. Saffrich R. Pepperkok R. Barone M.V. Philipson L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4291-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The reported numbers are the mean from at least five independent experiments and are given as mean ± S.D. Differences between controls and the variants were assessed by Student's t test; a p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. BrdUrd Incorporation—NIH-3T3 were transfected with the various cDNA-containing expression vectors. DNA synthesis was assayed by a 2-h pulse with 100 μm BrdUrd, and incorporation was monitored as reported (34Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 387: 509-512Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar) by using the in situ cell proliferation kit FLUOS (Roche Applied Science). Experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Data are given as mean ± S.D. Differences were assessed by Student's t test; a p value less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. Immunofluorescence Analysis—NIH-3T3 and Caco2 cells were plated on coverslips and transfected with the various expression vectors. Coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, paraformaldehyde-fixed, permeabilized with Triton X-100, and incubated for 1 h with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% v/v bovine serum albumin. The fixed cells were then stained with anti-V5, anti-HA, or anti-FLAG antibodies (Invitrogen and Sigma) and revealed with Texas red-conjugated affini-pure anti-mouse IgG. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). Images were generated with an Axiophot fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss) using ×40 and ×100 objectives. Images were processed using KS300 software (Carl Zeiss). Identification and Analysis of the γORF4 Transcript—Using human genome sequencing data (UCSC Genome Browser, genome.ucsc.edu), we looked for expressed sequence tags (EST) and conserved non-coding sequences between human and mouse sequences distributed at the 3′-end of the chromosomal region spanning the entire PPARG. We identified an intriguing non-coding sequence at the 3′-end of exon 4 that extends into the intronic sequences. This non-coding sequence overlaps two ESTs initially identified in an ovary fibrothecoma (BF514811) and in an adenocarcinoma (AI476551). Both ESTs code for the same product, which we examined in detail (Fig. 1A). We next looked for the putative transcript, named γORF4, in cDNAs from two human transformed colon cell lines and from colon and ovarian carcinoma tissues. To this aim, we used RT-PCR analysis with oligonucleotides located on exon 1 and intron 4 sequences within the EST as primers (Fig. 1B). The RT-PCR analysis confirmed production of the γORF4 transcript, and we extended the analysis to the full-length cDNA. To map the correct ends of the transcript, primers on exons A and B (for the 5′-end) were synthesized and paired with primers synthesized on the intronic sequences at different distances from the splice junction between exon 4 and intron 4 (for the 3′-end) (data not shown). Sequence analysis of the products obtained yielded two full transcripts of about 1600 nucleotides originating from exons A and B (European Molecular Biology Laboratory accession number AJ563369 and AJ563370) (Fig. 1C). No base pair changes or deletions were detected versus the wild-type sequence. It is noteworthy that there were no mutations in the exon-intron junctions that could explain the readthrough in intron 4. Only the transcript from exon A was characterized further. It contains the PPARG coding sequences from exon 1 to exon 4 plus 63 additional in-frame nucleotides derived from intron 4 sequences. The γORF4 mRNA extends into the intron for about 1 kb up to a canonical poly-A addition site and reaches a length similar to that of the entire PPARG transcript, which explains why it has eluded detection so far. We would expect this transcript to generate a protein containing the PPARγ sequence from amino acid 1 to 273 plus 21 new C-terminal amino acids derived from the intronic sequences. Thus, the expected protein would lack the entire ligand-binding domain (Fig. 1D). In Vitro Expression and Subcellular Localization of PPARγ and the γORF4 Isoform—To determine whether the γORF4 transcript is translated into protein in an in vitro system and to investigate its biological role, we performed transient transfections in Cos7, NIH-3T3, and Caco2 cells using expression vectors containing PPARγ1, PPARγ2, and γORF4 cDNAs (Fig. 2A). All cDNAs were fused in-frame to DNA segments coding for specific epitopes (HA, FLAG, and V5) recognized by commercially available antibodies. These antibodies reveal only the proteins synthesized by the transfected cDNAs. In fact, using anti-FLAG antibodies, specific bands corresponding to the tagged PPARγ or γORF4 proteins (∼ 60 and 40 kDa, respectively) were obtained in Western blots of transfected cell extracts (Fig. 2B). Their intensity was similar, indicating that the two proteins are synthesized at equivalent levels (data not shown). Similar bands were detected with anti-PPARγ antibodies (data not shown). PPARγ and γORF4 proteins were also localized by immunofluorescence. Using an epitope-specific antibody (anti-FLAG) on transiently transfected NIH-3T3 and Caco2 cells, PPARγ showed diffuse cell staining, whereas the isoform showed mainly nuclear staining (Fig. 2C). To rule out that this result was due to the high expression of the protein in a limited number of transfected cells, we did the same experiments with cells stably expressing PPARγ or γORF4 and obtained a similar result (data not shown). Thus, the isoform has a more evident nuclear localization than PPARγ. Transcriptional Activity of PPARγ and γORF4 in Vitro—We evaluated the transactivation capacity of PPARγ and γORF4 by cotransfecting into Cos7 cells expression vectors carrying their corresponding cDNAs and a reporter gene. This construct contains three copies of a PPRE fused upstream to the minimal herpes simplex TK promoter that in turn drives transcription of a luciferase reporter gene. The cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of troglitazone, a PPARγ-selective ligand belonging to the thiazolidinedione family (5Knouff C. Auwerx J. Endoc. Rev. 2004; 25: 899-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). PPARγ-transfected cells had a strong ligand-dependent transcriptional response, whereas γORF4 resulted in a negligible response, even at the highest ligand concentrations used (Fig. 3A). Indeed, luciferase activity was even lower (∼50%) in γORF4-transfected cells than in cells transfected with the empty expression vector, which probably reflects inhibition of the endogenous receptor (Fig. 3A, inset). Cells were also transfected with the PPRE-luciferase reporter gene and increasing amounts of PPARγ or γORF4 expression vectors in the presence of a fixed concentration of the ligand (1 μm troglitazone). PPARγ caused a proportional increase of luciferase activity, whereas γORF4 did not, even at the highest ratios used (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the isoform does not promote transcription from a reporter gene and can conceivably interfere with PPARγ receptor activity. To investigate this possibility, we cotransfected Cos7 cells with the PPRE-TK-luciferase reporter gene and equal amounts of PPARγ and γORF4 expression vectors (ratio 1:1) in the presence of increasing concentrations of troglitazone. At all ligand concentrations, luciferase activity was markedly lower (∼60% of the PPARγ-induced response) than reporter gene activation in cells cotransfected with PPARγ expression vector alone (Fig. 3C). A similar degree of interference of PPARG point mutants has been attributed to a dominant negative mode of action (35Collingwood T.N. Butler A. Tone Y. Clifton-Bligh R.J. Parker M.G. Chatterjee V.K.

Indeed, we assayed one of these dominant negative mutants in our cell system, obtaining results similar to those reported here with the new isoform (data not shown). We next tested γORF4 inhibition in cells transfected with fixed amounts of the reporter gene and PPARγ expression vector together with increasing concentrations of γORF4 cDNA-containing vector. The addition of the isoform proportionally reduced luciferase activity (Fig. 3D). These experiments demonstrate that γORF4 interferes with the transactivation properties of PPARγ. γORF4 Is Expressed in Primary Colorectal Cancers—We next analyzed 25 sporadic colorectal cancers to determine whether the newly identified isoform is expressed in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2084896237,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations that disrupt the surface localization and/or gating of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. The most common CF mutant is ΔF508-CFTR, which inefficiently traffics to the surfaces of most cells. The ΔF508 mutation may also disrupt the opening of CFTR channels once they reach the cell surface, but the extent of this gating defect is unclear. Here, we describe potent activators of wild-type and ΔF508-CFTR channels that are structurally related to 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoate (NPPB), a negatively charged pore blocker that we show to have mixed agonistic activity (channel activation plus voltage-dependent pore block). These CFTR agonists include 1) an uncharged NPPB analog that stimulates channel opening at submicromolar concentrations without blocking the pore and 2) curcumin, a dietary compound recently reported to augment ΔF508-CFTR function in mice by an unknown mechanism. The uncharged NPPB analog enhanced the activities of wild-type and ΔF508-CFTR channels both in excised membrane patches and in intact epithelial monolayers. This compound increased the open probabilities of ΔF508-CFTR channels in excised membrane patches by 10–15-fold under conditions in which wild-type channels were already maximally active. Our results support the emerging view that CFTR channel activity is substantially reduced by the ΔF508 mutation and that effective CF therapies may require the use of channel openers to activate mutant CFTR channels at the cell surface.

Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). CFTR channels are normally activated by MgATP binding to the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and phosphorylation of the regulatory domain by protein kinase A (PKA) (2Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S77-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 3Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Many different mutations in these domains can cause CF, but the most common CF mutation is deletion of Phe-508 from NBD1 (ΔF508) (4Zielenski J. Tsui L.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 777-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The consensus view is that this mutation disrupts the biosynthetic maturation and surface localization of CFTR (5Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar, 6Riordan J.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1499-1504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, it has been argued that ΔF508-CFTR channels may reach the surfaces of a subset of cells in vivo (7Kälin N. Claaβ A. Sommer M. Puchelle E. Tümmler B. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1379-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). There is accumulating evidence that the ΔF508 mutation also affects the gating (opening and closing) of CFTR channels once they reach the cell surface, but the extent of this gating defect is unclear (8Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Reyes E. Chang X. Rommens J.M. Bear C.E. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 9Schultz B.D. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. J. Membr.

Determining the extent to which the ΔF508 mutation disrupts channel activity is central to the development of appropriate treatment strategies.CFTR gating is also modulated by reactive glutathione species, which inhibit channel opening in the presence of MgATP and PKA by glutathionylating a cysteine in NBD2 (12Wang W. Oliva C. Li G. Holmgen A. Lillig C.H. Kirk K.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here, we report that, while studying the effect of glutathionylation on CFTR gating, we observed that these modified channels could be activated by 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoate (NPPB), a negatively charged compound previously shown to block the pore in a voltage-dependent manner (13Zhang Z-R. Zeltwanger S. McCarty N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 175: 35-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we identified structurally related compounds that behave as pure CFTR agonists that stimulate channel opening without blocking the pore. By using these compounds as functional probes of mutant CFTR gating, we show that (i) the ΔF508 mutation profoundly decreases the opening rates of surface-localized channels and (ii) this defect can be corrected by such compounds. Our results support the view that effective CF therapies may require the use of CFTR channel openers (9Schultz B.D. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Yang H. Shelat A.A. Guy R.K. Gopinath V.S. Ma T. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Taddei A. Folli C. Pedemonte N. Galietta L.J.V. Verkman A.S. J.

W. Hanrahan (McGill University). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant CFTR cDNA using the Lipofectamine transfection kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 5 or 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm penicillin/streptomycin. CFTR expression in the transfected HEK-293T cells was verified by immunoblotting. The growth medium for the BHK-CFTR cells also contained 0.5 mm methotrexate to maintain selection for CFTR-expressing cells (15Chappe V. Hinkson D.A. Zhu T. Chang X-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 548: 39-52Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). CFBE41o– cells that were stably transfected with ΔF508-CFTR were cultured as described (16Hentchel-Franks K. Lozano D. Eubanks-Tarn V. Cobb B. Fan L. Oster R. Sorscher E. Clancy J.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For patch clamp recording, all cells were grown on plastic coverslips and used 1–4 days post-seeding. Cells expressing ΔF508-CFTR or ΔR-S660A-CFTR (where “R” is the regulatory domain) were grown for 1–2 days at 27 °C (low temperature-corrected) because these mutants are temperature-sensitive endoplasmic reticulum processing mutants that exhibit low surface expression when cells are cultured at 37 °C.Patch Clamp Analysis—Macroscopic and single channel currents were recorded in the excised inside-out configuration. Patch pipettes were pulled from Corning 8161 glass to tip resistances of 1.5–4.0 megaohms (macroscopic recordings) or 15–18 megaohms (single channel studies). CFTR channels were activated following patch excision by exposure of the cytoplasmic face of the patch to the catalytic subunit of PKA (110 units/ml; Promega) and MgATP (1.5 mm) unless indicated otherwise. CFTR currents were recorded in symmetrical solutions each containing 140 mmN-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm TES (pH 7.3). Macroscopic currents were evoked using a ramp protocol from +80 to –80 mV with a 10-s time period. Patches were held at –80 mV for single channel recordings. All patch clamp experiments were performed at 21–23 °C. Signals from macroscopic and single channel recording were filtered at 20 and 200 Hz, respectively. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using pCLAMP 9.1 software (Axon Instruments). Opening rates (openings/s/patch) were estimated from 3–5-min records by dividing the total number of events (openings plus closings) detected by the pCLAMP software by 2× the time period. Single channel opening rates and single channel open probabilities (Po) were calculated assuming that the number of channels/patch equals the maximum detected number of simultaneous openings. This analysis was limited to patches for which there were fewer than eight detectable open levels, i.e. the limit for the analysis software. Note that this biases the analysis to patches that are less responsive to activation by compounds. Curve fitting was performed using Microcal Origin software.Ussing Chamber Experiments—CFBE41o– epithelial cells stably transfected with ΔF508-CFTR or transiently transfected with wild-type CFTR were cultured as electrically resistive monolayers and assayed in Ussing chambers as described (16Hentchel-Franks K. Lozano D. Eubanks-Tarn V. Cobb B. Fan L. Oster R. Sorscher E. Clancy J.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). ΔF508-CFTR-expressing monolayers were grown at 27 °C for 2–3 days to enhance the surface expression of this temperature-sensitive mutant. A serosal-to-mucosal Cl– gradient (120 to 1.2 mm) was imposed, followed by amiloride addition (100 μm) to block Na+ currents. Compounds were added to both chambers at the indicated concentrations. A 3-mV voltage pulse was imposed every 100 s to monitor transepithelial resistance.RESULTSNPPB Behaves as a Mixed Agonist toward Glutathionylated or Incompletely Phosphorylated CFTR Channels—Fig. 1A shows the inhibitory effect of an equimolar mixture of GSH and diamide (a strong thiol oxidizer) on the macroscopic current mediated by many CFTR channels (>100) in an inside-out membrane patch. This effect is due to glutathionylation of a cysteine in NBD2, which causes a dramatic reduction in the channel opening rate (12Wang W. Oliva C. Li G. Holmgen A. Lillig C.H. Kirk K.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, when NPPB (200 μm) was added to block the residual CFTR current, we observed a large increase in current at positive voltages (i.e. voltages at which pore block by the negatively charged compound is less effective). The currents that are induced by NPPB at positive potentials are CFTR-mediated based on two criteria: (i) absence in membrane patches excised from CFTR– cells (see Fig. 3B) and (ii) inhibition by higher doses of NPPB (Fig. 1, E and F) or by 200 μm glibenclamide, another CFTR blocker (17Schultz B.D. DeRoos A.D. Venglarik C.J. Singh A.K. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L192-L200PubMed Google Scholar). (At lower doses, glibenclamide could partially mimic the stimulatory effect of NPPB (data not shown).) This stimulatory effect was specific in that CFTR currents were not induced by two other voltage-dependent blockers of the CFTR pore (10 mm SCN– (18Tabcharani J.A. Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and 0.5 mm diphenylamine carboxylate (13Zhang Z-R. Zeltwanger S. McCarty N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 175: 35-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)) (data not shown) or by 400 μm 2-amino-4-phenylbutyric acid, a truncated derivative of NPPB (Fig. 1B; see Fig. 2A). The stimulation by NPPB was not due to a reducing agent-like effect of this compound on oxidized CFTR channels because the increase in current was rapidly reversed upon washout from the bath (Fig. 1A), unlike the case for dithiothreitol (12Wang W. Oliva C. Li G. Holmgen A. Lillig C.H. Kirk K.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Fig. 3NPPB-AM increases the rate of CFTR channel opening without affecting the phosphorylation state.A, NPPB-AM and NPPB markedly stimulate ΔR-S660A-CFTR currents minus PKA across an excised HEK-293T patch.

C, effects of NPPB-AM (10 μm) and glibenclamide (glib; 300 μm) on CFTR channel activity in a BHK-CFTR micropatch. The holding potential was –80 mV. Channels were first activated by 2 units/ml PKA, followed by PKI. D, mean data showing that NPPB-AM stimulates the opening rates of poorly phosphorylated CFTR channels. The conditions were as described for C. The data are means ± S.E. (n = 7). Opening rates represent the total number of openings/s/patch. The “best guess” estimates of the mean single channel opening rates and single channel Po values for the pre- and post-NPPB-AM conditions (assuming that N is the maximum number of simultaneous openings after NPPB-AM addition) were as follows: 0.26 ± 0.09 (pre) and 1.07 ± 0.29 (post) openings/s/channel and Po = 0.06 ± 0.01 (pre) and 0.26 ± 0.06 (post) (means ± S.E., n = 7). E, NPPB-AM weakly activates G551D-CFTR, whereas high doses of NPPB markedly stimulate this mutant at high PKA concentrations in excised HEK-293T patches. Note the scale change at the asterisk. See mean data in F. F, NPPB stimulates wild-type CFTR currents (WT; ○) at lower doses than G551D-CFTR currents (●) in excised HEK-293T patches. Wild-type channels were activated with low PKA concentration. The conditions for G551D-CFTR were as described for E.

D, mean titration data fit to the Michaelis-Menten function (EC50 = 0.96 ± 0.19 μm). The conditions were as described for B and C. Data were normalized to the peak current at 10 μm NPPB-AM. The lowest dose tested was 125 nm, which increased the current by ~20%. The results are means ± S.E. (n = 8). E, NPPB-AM has a greater relative stimulatory effect on poorly phosphorylated CFTR channels. F, curcumin also stimulates CFTR currents, although less potently and less stably than NPPB-AM. The results are representative of six experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Based on the unexpected stimulatory effect of this pore blocker on glutathionylated channels, we determined whether NPPB could stimulate the activities of unmodified CFTR channels that are phosphorylated at low levels (i.e. under conditions of submaximum stimulation by PKA). Fig. 1C shows that NPPB also stimulated CFTR currents at depolarizing potentials when channels were first minimally phosphorylated by treating the patch with a low concentration of PKA (2 units/ml), followed by PKA inhibitory peptide (PKI) to inhibit further phosphorylation. Currents in both directions were increased by low micromolar concentrations of NPPB; at higher concentrations, a voltage-dependent block was observed. As expected, channels that were highly phosphorylated by continuous exposure to a high PKA concentration (110 units/ml; standard CFTR activation conditions) exhibited only a voltage-dependent block by NPPB (Fig. 1D). Thus, the relative enhancement of channel activity by NPPB is inversely related to the level of CFTR phosphorylation. We conclude that NPPB behaves as a mixed agonist toward thiolated or poorly phosphorylated CFTR channels, i.e. this compound stimulates partially active channels in addition to blocking the pore in a voltage-dependent fashion.To determine whether NPPB activates CFTR by binding to the same (or different) site that causes a pore block, we tested its effects on a CFTR pore mutant (R347E) that is resistant to block by NPPB (19Walsh K.B. Long K.J. Shen X. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 (E and F) shows that NPPB stimulated the currents mediated by R347E-CFTR at positive potentials to a greater extent compared with wild-type CFTR at moderate levels of phosphorylation (high PKA concentration (110 units/ml), followed by PKI). Unlike the wild-type channel, the R347E-CFTR currents were stimulated by NPPB even at negative potentials. Thus, NPPB behaves more as a pure agonist for the R347E pore mutant, which implies that this compound stimulates channel opening by binding to a site that is distinct from the pore-blocking site.CFTR Agonists That Activate the Channel without Blocking the Pore—The inhibitory effect of NPPB on CFTR currents presumably depends in part on the negative charge of this compound, as evidenced by the voltage dependence of the block. To explore this point further and to identify compounds that are pure CFTR agonists, we tested several neutral NPBB derivatives and related compounds for their effects on CFTR channel activity (see Fig. 2A). Two neutral NPPB derivatives had been synthesized earlier in a screen for photosystem II herbicides (20Bock A. Krieger-Liszkay A. Ortiz de Zarate I. Schönknecht G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar): a benzamide derivative (NPPB-AM) and a benzenesulfonamide derivative (NPPB-sulf). Neither of these compounds is an effective inhibitor of photosystem II (20Bock A. Krieger-Liszkay A. Ortiz de Zarate I. Schönknecht G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, we discovered that NPPB-AM is a potent activator of CFTR channels (Fig. 2). In pilot experiments, we observed that 10 μm NPPB-AM effectively stimulated the currents mediated by moderately phosphorylated CFTR channels (Fig. 2, B–D) or glutathionylated channels (data not shown) in excised membrane patches. NPPB-sulf had only weak effects at 100 μm and was not studied further (data not shown). The stimulatory effect of NPPB-AM was rapid, stable, quickly reversible upon washout, and inhibited by the subsequent addition of 200 μm glibenclamide (Fig. 2, B and E; see Fig. 4A). The relative stimulation by NPPB-AM varied with the degree of CFTR phosphorylation (greatest effects at low levels of phosphorylation), as was observed for the parent compound, NPPB (Fig. 2, compare B and E). However, the stimulation by NPPB-AM was voltage-independent, with no evidence for CFTR inhibition at any holding potential. CFTR activation by either compound required the presence of both MgATP and at least a low concentration of PKA (2 units/ml) (data not shown). Like the parent compound, NPPB-AM had no effect on currents across membrane patches excised from CFTR– cells (e.g. see Fig. 3B). In titration experiments, we observed detectable increases in CFTR currents at NPPB-AM concentrations as low as 125 nm, with EC50 ~ 1 μm (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, NPPB-AM behaves as a pure CFTR agonist over the nanomolar to low micromolar range.Fig. 4NPPB-AM and NPPB markedly stimulate ΔF508-CFTR channels.A, stimulation of a ΔF508-CFTR macroscopic current across an excised HEK-293T patch. high PKA, 110 units/ml. B, mean data showing that NPPB-AM much more greatly stimulates ΔF508-CFTR currents than wild-type currents (WT) in excised patches exposed to a high PKA concentration. Error bars indicate the means ± S.E. of five to eight experiments. All results were obtained from wild-type CFTR- or ΔF508-CFTR-transfected HEK-293T cells with the exception of the gray bar (CFBE41o– cells stably transfected with ΔF508-CFTR). ΔF508-CFTR-expressing cells were “low temperature-corrected” as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, ΔF508-CFTR channel activation by NPPB-AM in an excised HEK-293T micropatch containing sufficiently few channels to resolve unitary currents.

D, effects of NPPB-AM on the mean opening rates and Po for ΔF508-CFTR in excised membrane patches (n = four HEK-293T patches). Opening rates represent the total number of openings/s/patch. The best guess estimates of the mean single channel opening rates and single channel Po values for the pre- and post-NPPB-AM conditions (assuming that N is the maximum number of simultaneous openings after NPPB-AM addition) were as follows: 0.20 ± 0.11 (pre) and 0.87 ± 0.31 (post) openings/s/channel and Po = 0.05 ± 0.03 (pre) and 0.25 ± 0.07 (post) (mean ± S.E., n = 4). E, a representative excised HEK-293T micropatch showing the dramatic activation of ΔF508-CFTR channels by NPPB-AM and illustrating the difficulty in estimating channel number under control conditions for this mutant. The conditions were as described for C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The structure of NPPB-AM (two aromatic rings separated by a hydrocarbon spacer) is generally similar to that of a dietary compound that has attracted considerable interest in the CF field, viz. curcumin (a main ingredient in turmeric) (Fig. 2A). Egan et al. (21Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. GlöcknerPagel J. Canny S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Caplan M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) reported that curcumin promotes the biosynthetic maturation and functional correction of the ΔF508-CFTR mutant in tissue culture cells and in mice. They proposed that the mechanism for this apparent effect is indirect and involves perturbations in Ca2+ pump activity and chaperone function in the endoplasmic reticulum. Whether curcumin promotes the maturation of the ΔF508-CFTR protein in the endoplasmic reticulum is controversial (e.g. see Ref. 22Song Y. Sonawane N.D. Salinas D. Qian L. Pedemonte N. Galietta L.J.V. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40629-40633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, because of its general similarity to NPPB-AM, we were intrigued by the possibility that curcumin could have a direct effect on CFTR gating, which might explain some of the functional correction that was reported by Egan et al. (21Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. GlöcknerPagel J. Canny S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Caplan M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Fig. 2F shows that curcumin (0.5–10 μm) also stimulated the currents mediated by wild-type CFTR in excised membrane patches. This stimulatory effect was voltage-independent, although it was less stable (i.e. time-dependent) than that observed for NPPB-AM. We show below that curcumin also markedly stimulated the activities of ΔF508-CFTR channels.NPPB-AM Increases the Single Channel Opening Rate—Fig. 3 shows that the most potent agonist (NPPB-AM) primarily stimulated CFTR activity by increasing the channel opening rate independently of any effect on CFTR phosphorylation. Two observations indicate that NPPB-AM stimulated CFTR channel activity in excised membrane patches (for which channel number is presumably constant) without affecting CFTR phosphorylation. First, this compound and the parent compound (NPPB) reversibly stimulated CFTR currents following PKA washout or the addition of PKI (Figs. 1 and 2). Second, NPPB-AM markedly stimulated the currents mediated by a regulatory domain deletion mutant (ΔR-S660A-CFTR) (Fig. 3A) that exhibits low constitutive activity in the absence of PKA (23Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Anderson M.P. Manavalan P. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 253: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). NPPB-AM had no obvious effect on the MgATP sensitivity of CFTR activity as determined in MgATP titration experiments performed in the presence and absence of this compound (data not shown). However, NPPB-AM did markedly increase the opening rates and mean single channel Po values for partially phosphorylated CFTR channels (2 units/ml PKA) determined in “micropatch” experiments (i.e. patches containing fewer than eight channels each) (Fig. 3, C and D). We conclude that this compound stimulates the opening of individual CFTR channels possibly at a step downstream of nucleotide binding.NPPB-AM Markedly Stimulates the Opening of ΔF508-CFTR Channels under Conditions in Which Wild-type Channels Are Maximally Activated—We next tested the effects of NPPB and derivatives on the two most common CF mutants: G551D-CFTR and ΔF508-CFTR. G551D-CFTR is a gating mutant (24Gregory R.J. Rich D.P. Cheng S.H. Souza D.W. Paul S. Manavalan P. Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3886-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) that, unlike ΔF508-CFTR, is trafficked to the cell surface with efficiency similar to that of wild-type CFTR. The G551D mutation maps to a region in NBD1 that likely plays a role in MgATP binding or the conformational coupling between ATP binding and the opening of the pore within the transmembrane domains (ATP-binding cassette transporter signature sequence) (25Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the activity of this mutant was negligibly stimulated by 10 μm NPPB-AM (Fig. 3E), a dose that maximally stimulated the wild-type channel (Fig. 2). However, G551D-CFTR activity was markedly stimulated by high doses of the charged parent compound (NPPB), doses that were impossible to achieve for the less soluble uncharged derivative (Fig. 3E). In NPPB titration experiments, we observed an appreciable shift toward higher concentrations of NPPB for G551D-CFTR activation compared with wild-type channel activation (Fig. 3F). This result implies that the G551D mutation in NBD1 reduces the apparent affinity of NPPB (and presumably of NPPB-AM) for its activation site.Fig. 4 shows that membrane-resident ΔF508-CFTR channels were dramatically stimulated by NPPB, NPPB-AM, and curcumin under conditions that maximally stimulated wild-type channels. HEK-293T cells transiently transfected with ΔF508-CFTR or CF bronchial epithelial cells stably transfected with ΔF508-CFTR (CFBE41o– cells) (16Hentchel-Franks K. Lozano D. Eubanks-Tarn V. Cobb B.

NPPB-AM was added after treating the patch for an extended time (5–10 min) with a high PKA concentration (110 units/ml) to exclude the possibility that ΔF508-CFTR channels had not achieved steady-state phosphorylation prior to adding the agonist (Fig. 4A) (11Wang F.S.

This reaction ought to be tightly controlled because excessive formation of quinones and systemic hypermelanization are deleterious to the hosts, suggesting that a negative regulator(s) of melanin synthesis may exist in hemolymph. Here, we report the purification and cloning of a cDNA of a novel 43-kDa protein, from the meal-worm Tenebrio molitor, which functions as a melanization-inhibiting protein (MIP). The deduced amino acid sequence of 352 residues has no homology to known sequences in protein data bases. When the concentration of the 43-kDa protein was examined by Western blot analysis in a melanin-induced hemolymph prepared by injection of Candida albicans into T. molitor larvae, the 43-kDa protein specifically decreased in the melanin-induced hemolymph compared with control hemolymph. Recombinant MIP expressed in a baculovirus system had an inhibitory effect on melanin synthesis in vitro. RNA interference using a synthetic 445-mer double-stranded RNA of MIP injected into Tenebrio larvae showed that melanin synthesis was markedly induced. These results suggest that this 43-kDa MIP inhibits the formation of melanin and thus is a modulator of the melanization reaction to prevent the insect from excessive melanin synthesis in places where it should be inappropriate.

The innate immune system is a host defense mechanism that is evolutionarily conserved from plants to humans and is mainly involved in the recognition and control of the early stage of infection in all animals (1Hoffmann J.A.

It is activated by a group of germ line-encoded receptors and soluble proteins, conceptually termed pattern recognition receptors and proteins, which recognize microbial surface determinants that are conserved among microbes but absent in the host, such as lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, 1,3-β-d-glucan, and mannan. Upon recognition, these receptors activate distinct signaling cascades that regulate specific immune-related proteins aimed at the aggressors. Recently, our knowledge of innate immunity in mammals and insects has increased dramatically (1Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.

The recruitment of similar proteins and pathways in both insects and mammals in the fight against infection suggests that they have developed similar mechanisms and molecular pathways to recognize and eliminate pathogenic invaders (4Hultmark D.

The prophenoloxidase (pro-PO) 1The abbreviations used are: pro-PO, prophenoloxidase; DFP, diisopropyl fluorophosphate; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MEP, melanization-enhancing protein; MIP, melanization-inhibitory protein; nMIP, native MIP; PO, phenoloxidase; POI, PO inhibitor; PTU, phenylthiourea; rMIP, recombinant MIP; RNAi, RNA interference. system, like the vertebrate complement system, is a proteolytic cascade comprising pattern recognition proteins, serine proteases, their inhibitors, and terminates with the zymogen, pro-PO (7Söderhäll K.

Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 38: 128-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pro-PO system is an important non-self-recognition system present in most invertebrates. Microbial polysaccharides lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, and 1,3-β-d-glucan first react with pattern recognition proteins, which then induce activation of several serine proteases within the pro-PO system. Determining the molecular mechanism, by which pattern recognition molecules differentiate non-self from self and how to transduce signals that stimulate defense responses, is a key for understanding the ways in which innate immune systems are regulated. The pro-PO-activating enzymes or factors, which all are similar to Drosophila easter-type serine protease (clip domain-containing trypsin-like serine protease), cleave pro-PO to generate the active enzyme, phenoloxidase (PO) (11Lee S.Y. Cho M.Y. Hyun J.H. Lee K.M. Homma K-I. Natori S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This enzyme produces toxic compounds to microorganisms by oxidizing phenols to form the melanin pigment, and it also participates in the scleralization of the cuticle, which is vital for the survival of insects (8Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, New York1998: 135-172Google Scholar, 9Gillespie J. Kanost M.R. Trenczek T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 611-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Melanin synthesis is essential for defense and development but must be tightly controlled because systemic hyperactivation of the pro-PO system, excessive formation of quinones, and inappropriate excessive melanin synthesis are also deleterious to the hosts, suggesting that the pro-PO activation system and melanin formation are tightly regulated by melanization-regulatory molecules. Only a few inhibitors of the pro-PO system have been identified from insects and crustaceans (15Daquinag A.C. Nakamura S. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Tsukamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Previously, it has been shown that Drosophila serpin-27A specifically inhibited the pro-PO-activating enzyme and prevented the melanin synthesis induced by activated PO (19De Gregorio E. Han S.J. Lee W.J. Baek M.J. Osaki T. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Iwanaga S. Lemaitre B. Brey P.T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 581-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and that the proteinase inhibitor, pacifastin, efficiently inhibited the pro-PO-activating enzyme in a crayfish (18Liang Z. Sottrup-Jensen L. Aspan A. Hall M. Söderhäll K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6682-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the specific inhibitor protein for melanin formation induced by activated PO was not found. The identification of a specific melanization-inhibitory protein (MIP) will provide important information to clarify how an arthropod's innate immune reaction such as the melanization response is regulated and controlled. We reported previously that a 160-kDa vitellogenin-like protein was involved in melanin synthesis as a melanization-enhancing protein (MEP) in the beetle Tenebrio molitor (20Lee K.M. Lee K.Y. Choi H.W. Cho M.Y. Kwon T.H. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3695-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In our preliminary experiments we observed that a 43-kDa protein specifically disappeared from the hemolymph during melanin synthesis. Because the melanization-regulatory proteins usually disappear or are degraded during the melanization reaction, it is not easy to purify these proteins from crude hemolymph. Therefore, to purify a novel melanization-regulatory protein(s) of T. molitor larvae, we assumed that the components of pro-PO system should be in their nonactive form, and hence we prepared a nonactive pro-PO system by treating hemolymph with an irreversible serine protease inhibitor, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) to prevent activation of pro-PO-activating enzyme(s) (11Lee S.Y. Cho M.Y. Hyun J.H. Lee K.M. Homma K-I. Natori S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). By using DFP-treated hemolymph, we isolated a novel 43-kDa protein to homogeneity, cloned its cDNA, and examined its function by using RNA interference (RNAi) experiments in vivo and biochemical analysis in vitro. The recombinant 43-kDa protein was found to decrease the melanization reaction, but not PO activity in vitro. We here report for the first time a novel function of this 43-kDa protein as a negative regulator of the melanization reaction, which is an important innate immune reaction of arthropods. Animals and Collection of Hemolymph—The methods for raising the insects and collecting the hemolymph were as described previously (19De Gregorio E. Han S.J. Lee W.J. Baek M.J. Osaki T. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Iwanaga S. Lemaitre B. Brey P.T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 581-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Briefly, T. molitor larvae (mealworms) were maintained on a laboratory bench in terrarium containing wheat bran. Vegetables were placed on top of the bran to provide water. To harvest the hemolymph, the head of each larva was pricked with a 25-gauge needle. The extruding crude hemolymph from 25 larvae (about 20 μl of hemolymph/larva) was collected in 1 ml of a modified anticoagulation buffer (136 mm trisodium citrate, 26 mm citric acid, 20 mm EDTA, and 15 mm NaCl, pH 5.5) and then was centrifuged again at 203,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was named hemolymph and stored at -80 °C until use. Hemocytes were collected from the extruding crude hemolymph by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with anticoagulation buffer, and stored at -80 °C. About 3 × 106 packed cells were obtained from 500 μl of the crude hemolymph. Assay of PO Activity and Ability of Melanin Synthesis—An assay of PO and the preparation of G-100 solution were carried out according to our previously described method (20Lee K.M. Lee K.Y. Choi H.W. Cho M.Y. Kwon T.H. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3695-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, to obtain the solution showing PO activity in the presence of Ca2+ and 1,3-β-d-glucan, 50 ml of hemolymph was concentrated by ultrafiltration through a membrane filter (YM10, Amicon). Approximately 3 ml of the concentrated solution was applied to a Sephadex G-100 column (1 × 50 cm) equilibrated with anticoagulation buffer and eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 12 ml/h. Fractions showing specific PO activity in the presence of Ca2+ and 1,3-β-d-glucan were pooled and named G-100 solution. This solution was used to examine PO activity and melanin synthesis. To measure PO activity, 30 μl of G-100 solution (3.5 mg/ml proteins) was preincubated with 10 μl of 1,3-β-d-glucan (1 μg) for 5 min at 30 °C, and then 460 μl of the substrate solution (1 mm 4-methylcatechol, 2 mm 4-hydroxyproline ethylester in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm CaCl2) was added to the reaction mixture. After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, the increase in absorbance at 520 nm (A520) was measured using a spectrophotometer (Shimazu). One unit of PO activity was defined as the amount of enzyme causing an increase in absorbance of 0.1 at 520 nm/10-min incubation. Melanin synthesis was measured according to a method published previously (20Lee K.M. Lee K.Y. Choi H.W. Cho M.Y. Kwon T.H. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3695-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μl of G-100 solution (3.5 mg/ml proteins) was preincubated with 10 μl of 1,3-β-d-glucan (1 μg) at 30 °C for 5 min. After incubation, 460 μl of the substrate solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm dopamine and 10 mm CaCl2) was added to the reaction mixture and then incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The increase in absorbance at 400 nm, which records melanin formation, was measured. To examine the effects of purified native or recombinant MIP on the melanization reaction, the native MIP or recombinant MIP was preincubated with 20 μl of hemolymph (100 μg of proteins) in the presence or absence of Ca2+ and 1,3-β-d-glucan at 30 °C for 5 min. The melanization reaction was measured after incubation at 30 °C for 1 h as described above. Measurement of Amidase Activity during Pro-PO Activation—To determine amidase activity in the samples, commercially available trypsin substrate (t-butyloxycarbonyl-benzyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-seryl-l-arginine 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA)) was used. In our previous studies, we observed that this substrate was mostly hydrolyzed during insect pro-PO activation in the presence of 1,3-β-d-glucan and calcium ion (11Lee S.Y. Cho M.Y. Hyun J.H. Lee K.M. Homma K-I. Natori S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Lee M.H. Osaki T. Lee J.Y. Baek M.J. Zhang R.

This substrate was dissolved in dimethylformamide according to the instructions from the manufacturer. 100 μl of reaction mixture for measuring PO activity was incubated with 490 μl of substrate solution, which contains 40 μm substrate in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. After incubation of the mixture in the presence or the absence of MIP at 30 °C for 1 h, 500 μl of 17% (v/v) acetic acid was added to terminate the enzyme reaction. The specific amidase activity of the eluate solution can be detected by a fluorescence spectrophotometer at λex = 380 nm and (μg) λem = 460 nm. As a control, 100 μl of buffer A was added to check amidase activity as above. One unit of the amidase activity was defined as the amount that liberated 1 nmol of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin/min. SDS-PAGE Analysis of Hemolymph during Melanin Synthesis—To examine which bands of the hemolymph disappeared during PO-induced melanization, we induced melanin formation as described above. When melanin pigments were generated, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 28,500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions. To reconfirm whether the disappeared bands on SDS-PAGE were specifically related to melanin synthesis, a well known PO inhibitor, phenylthiourea (PTU), was added to the same reaction mixture under the same conditions. After incubation, the proteins of the supernatant were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Purification of Denatured 43-kDa MIP from Hemolymph—The denatured 43-kDa MIP was purified to homogeneity from polyacrylamide gel using the micro-Electroeluter (Centriluter, Amicon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the internal amino acid sequences, the purified protein (25 μg) was reduced, alkylated, and digested with 2 μg of lysylendopeptidase (Wako) at 37 °C for 12 h. The resulting peptides were separated through high performance liquid chromatography on a reverse phase C18 column (Waters) and applied to an amino acid sequencer (Applied Biosystem Procise Automated Gas Phase Sequencer). To determine the amino-terminal sequence, the purified protein (1 μg) transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride filter was applied directly to the amino acid sequencer. Antibody and Immunoblotting—Antibodies against the 43-kDa protein were raised by injecting 10 μg of the denatured 43-kDa protein into a male albino rabbit with complete Freund's adjuvant, and 14 days later two booster injections with the same amount of protein were done (22McCauley R. Racker E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The resulting antibody was affinity purified as described previously (23Lee S.Y. Kwon T.H. Hyun J.H. Choi J.S. Kawabata S-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and used for the purification of the native 43-kDa protein. For immunoblotting, the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was blocked by immersion in 5% skimmed milk solution containing 1% horse serum for 12 h. The membrane was then transferred to rinse solution I (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2.5% skimmed milk) containing the affinity-purified 43-kDa protein antibody (50 ng/ml) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The amounts of the bound antibodies were determined using ECL Western blotting reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of MIP-binding Protein in Hemolymph—The proteins of control G-100 solution (20 μg of proteins) and the supernatant of melanin-induced G-100 solution (20 μg) separated on SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the filter was blocked by immersion in 5% skim milk solution containing 1% horse serum for 12 h. The membrane was then incubated with the purified recombinant MIP (5 μg of protein) at 4 °C for 2 h. The membrane was then transferred to rinse solution I (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2.5% skimmed milk) containing the affinity-purified 43-kDa protein antibody (50 ng/ml) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The amounts of the bound antibodies were determined using ECL Western blotting reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). cDNA Cloning and Nucleotide Sequencing of 43-kDa MIP—A cDNA library from T. molitor larvae was constructed as described previously (24Cho M.Y. Lee H.S. Lee K.M. Homma K.I. Natori S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Among chemically determined four partial amino acid sequences of the purified 43-kDa protein, DNA oligonucleotide corresponding to YE-ANDDMI was synthesized as follows: 5′-TA(T/C)GA(A/G)GCIAA(T/C)GA(T/C)GA(T/C)ATGAT-3′, and it was labeled with [γ-32P]-ATP by a previously described method (25Sgaramella V. Khorana H.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 72: 427-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For the initial screening, ∼50,000 recombinants of T. molitor larvae cDNA library were used and the membranes were prehybridized at 65 °C for 1 h in 4 ×SSC (600 mm NaCl, 60 mm trisodium citrate, pH 7.0), 10 × Denhardt's solution (50 × Denhardt's solution: 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1% (w/v) Ficoll, and 1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone) and 25 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The membranes were then hybridized at 51.5 °C for 12 h in the same solution during prehybridization. We obtained 10 hybridization-positive clones and analyzed two plasmids containing four chemically determined partial amino acid sequences and amino-terminal sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of the 43-kDa protein was compared with the protein sequence data base of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the Genetyx system (Software Development Co., Ltd., Tokyo). Purification of the Native 43-kDa MIP (nMIP) from Tenebrio Hemolymph—To prevent the activation of Tenebrio pro-PO-activating enzyme(s), 600 μl of 0.5 m DFP was added to 150 ml of hemolymph (2 mm DFP as a final concentration), and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, and then the hemolymph was dialyzed at 4 °C for 12 h against 5 liters of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm EDTA, pH 6.0). After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min to remove the precipitated proteins, the supernatant was loaded onto a Sepharose CL-4B column (2 × 10 cm) preequilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with the same buffer until the A280 nm was 0 and then eluted with 1 m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing the 43-kDa protein were confirmed by Western blotting analysis and collected. The pooled fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration through a filter and Centricon (Amicon) to 1 ml and then loaded to a Sephacryl S-200 column (2 × 120 cm) preequilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.0) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min at 4 °C. Fractions containing the 43-kDa protein were pooled and diluted 10 times with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and then loaded onto a Mono Q FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with buffer C at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. After washing until the A280 nm was 0, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.75 m over 90 min. Fractions containing the 43-kDa protein from the Mono Q FPLC column were pooled and diluted with buffer C and then reloaded to the Mono Q FPLC column once again. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.25 to 0.75 m over 120 min. Finally, fractions containing the purified 43-kDa protein were pooled and concentrated to 0.1 mg/ml by Centricon. The identity and purity of the native 43-kDa protein were confirmed both by the determination of amino-terminal sequence and by the analysis of SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Expression and Purification of Recombinant MIP (rMIP)—The construction of the recombinant baculovirus vector and the expression of the rMIP were performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The cDNA encoding the mature MIP was subcloned into pFastBacDUAL vector (Invitrogen) using BamHI and HindIII enzyme sites. The recombinant virus for MIP expression was generated according to the manufacturer's instruction manual (Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus expression system, Invitrogen). The recombinant virus was amplified using Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9, Invitrogen) cells in SF-900II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. To produce the protein, Trichoplusia ni BTI-TN-5B1-4 (High-five, Invitrogen) cells were grown at 27 °C in 1 liter of Grace medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% Sf-900II serum-free medium and 0.1% Pluonic F-68 reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were infected with a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and were incubated for 5 days. For purification of rMIP from Hi-5 cells medium, 800 ml of medium was first concentrated into ∼100 ml by ultrafiltration through a membrane filter (Amicon, YM10) and then dialyzed against 10 liters of buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) at 4 °C for at least 18 h. After centrifugation at 3,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min to remove precipitates, the supernatant was mixed with 2 ml of precharged nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) preequilibrated with buffer D and gently rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. The unbound proteins were allowed to pass through the resin, and the resin was washed with 50 ml of buffer D containing 20 mm imidazole. The proteins bound to the resin were eluted with 200 mm imidazole in buffer D and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing rMIP were pooled and applied to a Mono Q FPLC column preequilibrated with buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). After washing with buffer E until the A280 nm was 0, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.9 m over 120 min, and the fractions containing rMIP were pooled and concentrated with Centricon to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was carried out to verify the sequence of rMIP. RNAi Experiments—The template (spanning from nucleotide 502 to 946) for synthesis of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for MIP was amplified from cDNA by PCR using the forward primer TAATACGACTCACTATAGGCTGATTTAGGCATTCCTGGC and the reverse primer TAATACGACTCACTATAAAGAAGAGGGGTTGACCAAGACTC. The dsRNA was synthesized using the T7 MEGAscript kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitated and finally dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Annealing of the complementary strands was performed by heating to 70 °C for 10 min and cooling overnight in water bath at room temperature. The template for synthesis of dsRNA for green fluorescent protein (dsGFP) was the PD2EGFP-1 plasmid (Clontech) was amplified by PCR using the forward primers TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGACGTAAACGGCCACAAGT and the reverse primer TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTTCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC, and dsRNA were then synthesized as described above. Tenebrio larvae were injected with 50 μl of dsRNA in 50 ng/μl phosphate-buffered saline using a 25-gauge needle. After the injection the larvae were kept at room temperature for 24 h. Reverse Transcription-PCR and Western Blot Analysis of dsRNA-treated Larvae—To detect MIP transcript, total RNA was isolated from the fat body of dsRNA-injected T. molitor larvae using the TRIzol LS regent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Contaminating genomic DNA was removed by treatment with RNase-free DNase I (1 unit/μl), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. After purification by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation the RNA (400 ng) was reverse-transcribed using Thermoscript (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was analyzed by PCR using the following primers: MIP (spanning from nucleotides 101 to 428) forward, CGTCGTCACTCCTCTCCAAAAG; reverse, TCGTCATCATCGTCGTCGTCGTAG. For controls (ribosomal protein L27a, accession number X99204) forward, GCATGGCAAACACAGAAAGCATC; and reverse, ATGACAGGTTGGTTAGGCAGGC. The PCR products were resolved on 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. For Western blotting analyses 40 μg of hemolymph proteins from MIP-dsRNA-treated larvae or GFP-dsRNA-treated larvae were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the immunoblotting was carried out as described above. Determination of MIP Localization—To determine the localization of the purified 43-kDa protein, we prepared plasma, extracts of hemocyte, and fat bodies as described previously (23Lee S.Y. Kwon T.H. Hyun J.H. Choi J.S. Kawabata S-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The hemocyte and plasma were obtained as described above. The precipitated hemocytes (3 × 108 cells) were washed with 500 μl of buffer A, suspended with 500 μl of buffer A, sonicated for 15 s at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 22,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was used as a source of hemocyte lysate. The soluble proteins of hemocyte lysate and fat bodies were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotting with the affinity-purified 43-kDa protein antibody was carried out.

Asbacterial UMP kinases have no counterpart in eukaryotes, the informationprovided here could help the design of new antibiotics. Nucleoside monophosphate kinases are key enzymes in the metabolism ofnucleotides. They represent a relatively homogeneous family of catalysts(1Yan H. Tsai M.D. Adv.Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 103-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) thought to derive from acommon ancestor. They catalyze the reversible transfer of theγ-phosphoryl group from a nucleoside triphosphate, generally ATP, to aparticular nucleoside monophosphate. The resulting nucleoside diphosphateswill be further phosphorylated (and eventually reduced) to produce nucleosidetriphosphates, precursors of the major biological molecules RNA, DNA, andphospholipids. Eukaryotic UMP/CMP kinases represent an exception to theotherwise generally observed specificity ofNMP 1The abbreviations used are: NMP, nucleoside monophosphate kinases; UMPK,UMP kinase; UMPKeco, E. coli UMPK; CBMK, carbamate kinase; NAG,N-acetyl-glutamate; NAGK, NAG kinase; r.m.s.d., root mean squaredeviation; ADPNP, 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: NMP, nucleoside monophosphate kinases; UMPK,UMP kinase; UMPKeco, E. coli UMPK; CBMK, carbamate kinase; NAG,N-acetyl-glutamate; NAGK, NAG kinase; r.m.s.d., root mean squaredeviation; ADPNP, 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate. kinases for thebase moiety of the phosphate acceptor nucleotide; they phosphorylate withcomparable efficiency both UMP and CMP. Conversely, bacteria possess twodistinct enzymes, specific to UMP or CMP. Bacterial CMP kinases are monomers,like most NMP kinases, and their overall fold is similar to that of otherenzymes of the latter family(2Briozzo P. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Gilles A.M. Gaucher J.F. Burlacu-Miron S. Sakamoto H. Janin J. Bârzu O. Structure. 1998; 6: 1517-1527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, bacterial UMPkinases are hexamers (3Serina L. Blondin C. Krin E. Sismeiro O. Danchin A. Sakamoto H. Gilles A.M. Bârzu O. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5066-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Theyspecifically phosphorylate UMP according to the scheme: UMP +Mg2+·ATP ↔ UDP + Mg2+·ADP. They areactivated by GTP and inhibited by UTP. This contributes to equilibrating thesynthesis of purine versus pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates. Genes coding for UMP kinases have been identified in all bacterial genomesinvestigated to date. They have no closely related counterpart in eukaryotesand have proved to be essential for growth in both Gram-negative species(Escherichia coli (4Yamanaka K. Ogura T. Niki H. Hiraga S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7517-7526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Smallshaw J. Kelln R.A. Genetics. 1992; 11: 59-65Google Scholar)) and some Gram-positivespecies (Streptococcus pneumoniae(6Fassy F. Krebs O. Lowinski M. Ferrari P. Winter J. Collard-Dutilleul V. Salahbey Hocini K. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)). They code for enzymesthat have strong sequence similarity. Therefore, bacterial UMP kinasesrepresent not only an interesting model of activity regulation but alsovaluable targets for antibacterial drugs. UMP kinase from E. coli (UMPKeco) has been the most studied enzymeof the family. Overall, its regulation seems to be complex. GTP and UTP actprimarily as effectors but also as weak phosphoryl donors; although theeffects of these two nucleotides are widely described as allosteric,Mg2+, an obligatory actor in the phosphoryl transfer reaction,dramatically decreases the inhibition by UTP, with no apparent effect on theactivation by GTP. Nevertheless, based on kinetic and fluorescence results, ithas been suggested that both nucleoside triphosphates bind to the sameallosteric site (7Serina L. Bucurenci N. Gilles A.M. Surewicz W.K. Fabian H. Mantsch H.H. Takahashi M. Petrescu I. Batelier G. Bârzu O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7003-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional structure was needed for a better understanding ofenzyme activity regulation. However, UMP kinase from E. coli exhibitslow solubility (∼0.1 mg·ml–1), and many othershave a low stability. This precluded for several years the determination oftheir crystal structure. Very recently, the UMP kinase from thehyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus was crystallized, butits structure could not be solved(8Marco-Marin C. Escamilla-Honrubia J.M. Rubio V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1747: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We previously obtained bysite-directed mutagenesis a variant of UMPKeco (D159N) similar to thewild-type enzyme in its stability and kinetic properties but significantlymore soluble at neutral pH. Its solubility increases with pH and in thepresence of magnesium-free UTP(7Serina L. Bucurenci N. Gilles A.M. Surewicz W.K. Fabian H. Mantsch H.H. Takahashi M. Petrescu I. Batelier G. Bârzu O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7003-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Altogether, theseproperties allowed us to get crystals of UTP-complexed UMPKeco suitable forx-ray crystallography. To further investigate the phosphorylation process, wethen solved the structures with the natural substrate UMP and with thereaction product UDP. In addition, we tested the role of 2 residues, which areinvolved in intersubunit active site contacts according to crystal structureanalysis, by site-directed mutagenesis. Chemicals—Nucleotides, restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase,VentDNA polymerase, Tfu DNA polymerase, and coupling enzymes werefrom Roche Applied Science, Sigma, or Qbiogene. Nucleoside diphosphate kinasefrom Dictyostelium discoideum (2000 units/mg of protein) was kindlyprovided by I. Lascu. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Growth Conditions, and DNAManipulations—General DNA manipulations were performed as describedby Sambrook et al.(9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The sequence coding forUMPKeco was amplified by the PCR method using the plasmid harboring the genewith the D159N mutation (7Serina L. Bucurenci N. Gilles A.M. Surewicz W.K. Fabian H. Mantsch H.H.

The PCRproducts were cloned at the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of the vectorpET28a. The resulting plasmid pLA 2.1.1 harboring the gene coding for UMPkinase D159N with a His tag was introduced into the E. coli strainBL21(DE3)pDIA17 (10Munier H. Gilles A.M. Glaser P. Krin E. Danchin A. Sarfati R.S. Bârzu O. Eur. J.Biochem. 1991; 196: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thetransformants were grown in the 2YT medium containing kanamycin (70 μg/ml)and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) at 37 °C. When the optical densityreached at least 1.5 at 600 nm, the expression of the recombinant proteins wasinduced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the growth wascontinued for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were then pelleted bycentrifugation and served as source for protein purification. The double mutants D159N,T138A and D159N,N140A and the triple mutantD159N,T138A,N140A were constructed by the one-tube PCR-based mutagenesismethod (11Picard V. Bock S. MethodsMol. Biol. 1997; 67: 183-188Google Scholar) using the plasmidpLA2.1.1 harboring the UMP kinase gene as template, Tfu DNApolymerase, the dNTPs, and the following mutagenic oligonucleotides:3′UMPK N140A,5′-GGTGGTAAAGAACGGGGCACCTGTACCGGCGGA-3′; 3′-UMPKT138A, 5′-AAAGAACGGGTTACCGGCACCGGCGGAGAGGAT-3′;3′-UMPK T138A N140A,5′-AAAGAACGGGGCACCTGCACCGGCGGAGAGGAT-3′. ThePCR product was cloned at the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of the vectorpET28a, giving respectively the plasmids pLA2.1.2, pLA2.1.3, and pLA2.1.4. Purification of UMP Kinase and Activity Assays—The differentN-terminal His-tagged variants of E. coli UMP kinase overproduced inthe same bacterial strain were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acidaffinity chromatography using the Qiagen express system(12Crowe J. Döbeli H. Gentz R. Hochulu E. Stüber D. Henco K. Methods Mol.Biol. 1994; 31: 371-387PubMed Google Scholar) after sonication in abuffer containing 3 mm UTP. The UMP kinase activity was determinedat 30 °C (0.5 ml final volume) using a coupled spectrophotometric assay(13Blondin C. Serina L. Wiesmüller L. Gilles A.M. Bârzu O. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The reaction mediumcontained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2,1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 1 mmATP, and 2 units each of lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and nucleosidediphosphate kinase. The pure or crude preparation of UMP kinase was thenadded, followed 2 min later by 0.3 mm UMP. The decrease inabsorbance at 340 nm was then recorded and corrected for secondary reactionsoccurring in the absence of UMP. One unit of UMP kinase corresponds to 1μmol of product formed per min. Protein concentration was measuredaccording to Bradford(14Bradford M.M. Anal.Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). For production of the selenomethionine derivative, selenomethionine wasincorporated in place of methionine, whereas the cells were growing in M9minimum medium containing kanamycin (70 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30μg/ml) at 37 °C. When the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5, themedium was supplemented with the amino acids lysine, threonine, andphenylalanine at 100 mg/ml and leucine, isoleucine, valine, andselenomethionine at 50 mg/ml. After 30 min, the expression was induced by theaddition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h. Ion spray mass spectra were used to check the variant proteins and theselenomethionine derivative. They were recorded on a quadrupole massspectrometer API-365 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with an ion spray(nebulizer-assisted electrospray) source. Crystallization and Data Collection—Three types ofcrystalline complexes were studied using the histidine-tagged D159N variant:with UMP, with UDP, or with UTP. Crystals were grown at 20 °C in a 50mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, by the vapor diffusion method. The6-μl hanging drop contained 3 mg/ml UMPKeco, the UXP ligand (5mm for UMP and UTP, 50 mm for UDP), 0.3 mpotassium sodium tartrate, 0.25% (w/v) n-octyl-β-d-glucoside,and (with UMP or UTP) 5% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentane diol. For theUTP-containing drops, the selenomethionine derivative of the enzyme was usedin the presence of 5 mm dithiothreitol. The drop contained ADPNP inthe case of UMP-(25 mm, in the presence of 25 mmMgCl2) and UTP-containing complexes (5 mm), but this ATPanalogue was not seen later in the corresponding electron density maps. Dropswere equilibrated with a reservoir solution containing the precipitantsodium/potassium tartrate (1.7 m with UMP, 1.3 m withUDP, 1.1 m with UTP). Good quality crystals only appeared when thecrystallization drop was in contact with the vacuum grease otherwise used forairtightness (with the exception of a unique UDP crystal). They were allowedto grow for several weeks before data collection. Prior to data collection,they were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution (consisting in reservoirsolution supplemented with 35% (v/v) glycerol) during 3 min and then frozen inliquid ethane. Data were collected at 100 K on the European SynchrotronRadiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, beamline BM30A, for crystalswith UDP or UTP and beamline ID14-2 for the crystal with UMP. With UTP, theabsorption edge of selenium was determined from fluorescence emission scans,and a data set was collected at the peak wavelength of selenium. All crystalsystems are rhombohedral, space group R3, with two molecules per asymmetricunit. Data were processed with DENZO and scaled and reduced with SCALEPACK(15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. DENZO,a Film Processing Program for Macromolecular Crystallography. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). Structure Solution, Model Building, and Refinement—The firststructure solved was that with UTP, using the single-wavelength anomalousdispersion method. The data were used in a single-wavelength anomalousdispersion routine implemented in the SOLVE/RESOLVE program suite version2.03. SOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) was used tofind the selenium sites, taking into account the calculated solvent content of45%. This led to the location of 12 of the 22 expected selenium atoms. Thenstatistical density modification and automated model building was done usingRESOLVE (17Terwilliger T. Acta Crystallogr.Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 59: 34-44PubMed Google Scholar), and refinementof the built model was done using REFMAC(18Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13818) Google Scholar). This allowedconstructing 116 of the 241 UMPKeco residues for molecule A and 121 formolecule B. Other residues were then hand-constructed. The structures of UMP-and UDP-UMPKeco complexes were solved by molecular replacement at 3.5 Åresolution with AMoRe (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar),using only the protein part of the UTP-UMPKeco model. In both cases, a cleardensity immediately appeared for the nucleotide. Models were built using TURBO(20Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. 77–78. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View,CA1989Google Scholar). CNS(21Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. ActaCrystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar) version 1.1 was used forrefinement, which was monitored using a free R factor. In all cases,simulated annealing was initially used, as well as non-crystallographicconstraints. Then the two molecules of the asymmetric unit were refined asdifferent models, using individual B factors. In the final steps, we placedwater molecules in residual density above 2.5 standard deviations. The finalmodels contain two polypeptide chains A and B corresponding respectively toeach of the two molecules from the asymmetric unit. A few residues (2–4,depending on the ligand and the chain) at the N-terminal end and residue 26from molecule B were missing. For the UMP-containing complex, this is also thecase of residues 176–178 in molecule A and for the UTP-containingcomplex of residue 112. Models were superposed with the procedure implementedin O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallog. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) with defaults, andthe relevant root mean square deviations for Cα atoms were calculatedusing O or DALI. The Protein Data Bank codes of the E. coli UMPKcomplexes are 2BNE with UMP, 2BND with UDP, and 2BNF with UTP. Overall Fold and Quaternary Structure—Theselenomethionine-substituted D159N variant of UMPKeco in complex with UTPcrystallized in the rhombohedral system, space group R3, with two moleculesper asymmetric unit. The structure was solved at 2.45 Å resolution in asingle-wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment. The crystals of the enzymecomplexed to UMP (2.3 Å resolution) or to UDP (2.6 Å resolution)were obtained in the same space group. Corresponding structures were solved bymolecular replacement using the UTP-UMP-Keco model. All three structures arevery similar (root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) for all Cα atoms of0.48 Å when comparing the UMP structure with that of UDP and of 0.76Å when comparing the UMP structure with that of UTP), and theirstereochemistry is good as indicated by Ramachandran plots.

All the β-strandsconstitute a unique, mainly parallel β-sheet; at increasing distancesfrom the α3 helix (pink), strands 4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 6, and 8 areparallel. This β-sheet is sandwiched between two layers of respectivelythree (α1, α3, α8) and four (α4, α5, α6,α7) α-helices. The fold also contains the external helix α2,and a 3-10 helix, η1.Fig. 2Overall fold and quaternary structure.

The globalstructure of these two subunits is nearly identical; r.m.s.d. between A and Bis 0.81 Å on 233 equivalent Cα atoms (UMP-UMPKeco model). Slightlydifferent positions are observed for the α6 and α7 helices, forthe loop connecting them, and also for the loop between β6 and β7.The dimer formation buries a surface of ∼2500 Å2 (takinginto account the sum of the buried surfaces of the two monomers),corresponding for each subunit to ∼11% of its total surface. The interfaceis mostly hydrophobic but also involves two hydrogen bonds connecting thehead-and-tail α3 helices through residues Asn-72 and Asp-93. This helixis by far the longest of the molecule (25 residues) and forms most of thedimer interface, the remaining part of which is mainly represented by theN-terminal side of α1 and the C-terminal side of α2. The three-fold axis of the rhombohedral crystal system applied to the dimergenerates a hexamer with a central channel. The interactions between twoneighbor dimers are less extended (buried surface ∼1430Å2, corresponding to ∼6.5% of the surface) than thosebetween two subunits of a dimer. They mostly involve hydrophobic interactions(mainly with residues from α3, α5, or α7), but also hydrogenbonds; the main-chain oxygen of Thr-138 from one subunit is H-bonded with theside-chain nitrogen of Asn-140 from the neighbor subunit(Fig. 2D). These 2residues also interact with the base moiety of UMP. As this creates across-talk path between the active sites of two neighbor dimers, we call theloop (Fig. 2A,green) containing these 2 residues the cross-talk loop. Comparison with Other Proteins of Known Three-dimensionalStructure—The fold of NMP kinases, including bacterial CMP kinases,contains three structurally distinct domains. The α/β-CORE domain,a parallel β-sheet surrounded by connecting α-helices, is used as arigid platform around which the LID and NMP-binding domains move in aninduced-fit mechanism, closing upon the phosphate donor and acceptornucleotides, respectively. This allows the phosphoryl transfer reaction toproceed (23Vonrhein C. Schlauderer G.J. Schulz G.E. Structure. 1995; 3: 483-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The majority ofNMP kinases are monomers, with a molecular mass around 25 kDa. The UMP-Kecosubunit molecular mass (25.8 kDa) is close to that of monomeric NMP kinases,but its fold is not related to any other member of that family of enzymes. Asearch for structural homologues of the UMPKeco subunit in the Protein DataBank using the program DALI(24Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) confirmed the absence ofsimilarity with other NMP kinases. It returned two proteins of the carbamatekinase-like superfamily (25Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5575) Google Scholar),with a Z-score of 19 (other proposed proteins had significantly lowerZ-scores: less than 8). Both are dimeric kinases. The first one is thecarbamate kinase from the extremophile P. furiosus (CBMK, ProteinData Bank access codes 1b7b and 1e19), with an r.m.s.d. of 4.0 Å over212 equivalent α-carbons. Many of the secondary structure elements areequivalent, but there are striking differences. When compared with UMPKeco(Fig. 1), carbamate kinase hastwo additional insertions: a very long one of 50 residues (between β4 andα4 from UMPKeco), including three antiparallel β-strands and anα-helix (26Ramòn-Maiques S. Marina A. Uriarte M. Fita I. Rubio V. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and ashorter one of 9 residues after Asp-146, forming a β-strand. The secondstructurally homologous protein is the N-acetyl glutamate kinase fromE. coli (NAGK, Protein Data Bank code 1gs5). Its structure is moresimilar to that of UMPKeco (r.m.s.d. 2.6 Å on 202 Cα atoms).However, there are important differences; NAGK contains three β-hairpins(Fig. 3, orange) closeto the phosphate acceptor that have no equivalent in UMPKeco. As a result,whereas both enzymes have the same number of α-helices, the former onecontains almost twice as many β-strands (16(27Ramòn-Maiques S. Marina A. Gil-Ortiz F. Fita I. Rubio V. Structure. 2002; 10: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), as opposed to only 9 forUMPKeco). Although there is a clear parenthood between NAGK and UMPKeco monomers,their quaternary structure assembly is fairly different. In the dimer ofUMPKeco observed in the asymmetric unit, the axes of the two long α3helices (Fig. 2B,pink) are parallel. Conversely, in the NAGK dimer, the axis of thelongest helix situated at the interface and equivalent to α3(Fig. 3B,pink) makes an angle of ∼65° with that of its counterpart inthe neighbor monomer. It is worth noting that the CBMK dimer is arranged verymuch like that of NAGK. The two latter kinases have therefore close quaternarystructures that contrast with that of UMP kinase. Binding of Ligands in the Phosphate Acceptor Cavity: The UMP Substrate,the Reaction Product UDP, or the Magnesium-free UTP Inhibitor—Theinteractions between E. coli UMP kinase and UMP are shown onFig. 4A. Those withuracil involve 2 residues from the cross-talk loop: Thr-138, which makes abidentate interaction with the carbonyl 04 oxygen, and Asn-140 which isH-bonded to Asn-3 from the uracil ring. The 2′OH from the ribose makeshydrogen bonds with the main-chain nitrogen of Gly-63 and with the side-chainoxygen of Asp-77. All three terminal oxygens of the α-phosphate interactwith enzyme residues: with a terminal nitrogen of Arg-62 side chain; with boththe side-chain oxygen and the main-chain nitrogen of Thr-145; and with theglycines 57 and 58. Thus, as is the case for other NMP kinases, severalconserved amino acid residues interact with the phosphate acceptor to allowthe simultaneous recognition of its base, sugar, and phosphate moieties. The interactions between the enzyme and the uracil, the ribose, or theα-phosphate from UDP (not shown) are very similar to those with UMP.Gly-58 binds the β-phosphate instead of the α-phosphate with thenucleoside monophosphate. The other interactions with the β-phosphate(Fig. 5A) involve theside chain of Arg-62, and in addition, 3 residues that are very close in thesequence: Lys-15, a residue essential for catalyticactivity 2C. Evrin and L. Assairi, unpublished data. through itsterminal nitrogen; Ser-17 (only for one molecule of the asymmetric unit)through its side-chain oxygen; and Gly-18.

However, recent studies argue strongly against a generalized increase in diabetic oxidative stress, which might instead be confined to the vascular wall. Here, we describe a pathway for glucose-stimulated protein oxidation and provide evidence of its complicity in diabetic microvascular disease. Low density lipoprotein incubated with pathophysiological concentrations of glucose became selectively enriched in ortho-tyrosine and meta-tyrosine, implicating a hydroxyl radical-like species in protein damage. Model system studies demonstrated that the reaction pathway requires both a reactive carbonyl group and a polyunsaturated fatty acid, involves lipid peroxidation, and is blocked by the carbonyl scavenger aminoguanidine. To explore the physiological relevance of the pathway, we used mass spectrometry and high pressure liquid chromatography to quantify oxidation products in control and hyperglycemic rats. Hyperglycemia raised levels of ortho-tyrosine, meta-tyrosine, and oxygenated lipids in the retina, a tissue rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Rats that received aminoguanidine did not show this increase in protein and lipid oxidation. In contrast, rats with diet-induced hyperlipidemia in the absence of hyperglycemia failed to exhibit increased protein and lipid oxidation products in the retina. Our observations suggest that generation of a hydroxyl radical-like species by a carbonyl/polyunsaturated fatty acid pathway might promote localized oxidative stress in tissues vulnerable to diabetic damage.

Diabetes mellitus markedly increases the risk of microvascular and macrovascular disease (1Skyler J. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North. Am. 2001; 30: 833-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). An elevated level of glucose is the metabolic hallmark of diabetes, and the degree of glycemic control has long been known to be a major risk factor for diabetic complications (1Skyler J. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North. Am. 2001; 30: 833-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 2Nathan D.M. Lancet. 1998; 352: 832-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These observations have given rise to the glucose hypothesis, which proposes that toxic effects of glucose mediate many of the deleterious effects of this disorder (1Skyler J. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North. Am. 2001; 30: 833-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 2Nathan D.M. Lancet. 1998; 352: 832-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was strongly supported by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, which demonstrated that intensive glucose-lowering therapy dramatically lowered the incidence of retinopathy and nephropathy (3Control Diabetes Group Complications Trial Research N.

Several mechanisms might explain the link between glucose and vascular disease, including mitochondrial dysfunction (5Brownlee M.

Another important factor might be oxidative stress, because in vitro oxidation of glucose produces reactive intermediates, carbonyl compounds, and AGEs, all of which have been linked to artery wall damage (5Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7030) Google Scholar, 6Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar, 7Bucala R. Cerami A. Adv.

J. 1987; 245: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). For example, collagen exposed to glycoxidation reactions in vitro (6Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar) accumulates the oxidized amino acids ortho-tyrosine and methionine sulfoxide as well as two well characterized AGEs, pentosidine and Nϵ-carboxymethyllysine. Levels of Nϵ-carboxymethyllysine and pentosidine correlate with the severity of diabetic complications (19Sell D.R. Lapolla A. Odetti P. Fogarty J. Monnier V.M. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, decreased levels of antioxidants and increased levels of markers of lipid oxidation products associate with diabetes (6Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar, 20Morrow J.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 368-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting that oxidative stress might play a causal role in diabetic vascular disease. Recent observations challenge the hypothesis that hyperglycemia increases oxidative stress, however. Wells-Knecht et al. (21Wells-Knecht M.C. Lyons T.J. McCance D.R. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) used sensitive and specific methods to demonstrate that age-adjusted levels of ortho-tyrosine and methionine sulfoxide are similar in skin collagen of diabetic and euglycemic subjects. Other studies have failed to find higher levels of glycoxidation products in urine and blood of diabetics than in euglycemic humans (6Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar, 22Dyer D.G. Dunn J.A. Thorpe S.R. Bailie K.E. Lyons T.J. McCance D.R. Baynes J.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 2463-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations argue strongly against an increase in generalized oxidative stress in diabetes, at least in the extracellular compartment. None of these studies excludes the possibility of a pathway that increases oxidative stress only in tissues such as the retina and artery wall that are prone to diabetic damage. One potentially destructive pathway involves reactive oxidant species generated by mitochondria (5Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7030) Google Scholar). Glucose promotes superoxide production in cultured endothelial cells (5Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7030) Google Scholar) and the endothelium of isolated aortic rings (23Gupta S. Chough E. Daley J. Oates P. Tornheim K. Ruderman N.B. Keaney Jr., J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C560-C566Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport block this process. In turn, superoxide or its products regulates gene expression and promote AGE formation (5Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7030) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence implicates cytosolic NAD(P)H oxidase as another potential source of reactive intermediates in the retina and aorta of diabetic rats (24Ellis E.A. Grant M.B. Murray F.T.

Clin. Pract. 2003; 60: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Another important mechanism might involve the ability of glucose to activate protein kinase C (14Ishii H. Jirousek M.R. Koya D. Takagi C. Xia P. Clermont A. Bursell S.E. Kern T.S. Ballas L.M. Heath W.F. Stramm L.E. Feener E.P. King G.L. Science. 1996; 272: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 26King G.L. Ishii H. Koya D. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1997; 60: S77-S85PubMed Google Scholar), which could prompt cells to generate oxidants by a variety of mechanisms (13Semenkovich C.F. Heinecke J.W. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Localized production of reactive intermediates might therefore contribute to diabetic retinopathy and atherosclerosis. We recently detected elevated levels of protein-bound ortho-tyrosine and meta-tyrosine in aortic proteins from cynomolgus monkeys subjected to short term hyperglycemia (27Pennathur S. Wagner J.D. Leeuwenburgh C. Litwak K.N. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Levels of these abnormal amino acids correlated strikingly with those of glycated hemoglobin in blood, suggesting that glucose or its metabolites had promoted protein oxidation. In vitro investigations into the stable end products of various oxidation pathways showed that hydroxyl radical generates both ortho-tyrosine and meta-tyrosine when it oxidizes proteins. These observations raise the possibility that the microenvironment of the diabetic artery wall promotes localized oxidized stress, which could be important in the pathogenesis of early diabetic macrovascular disease. In the current study, we investigated the mechanisms whereby glucose and metabolites of glucose, such as glyoxal and sorbitol, that accumulate in diabetics (6Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar, 15Hunt J.V. Dean R.T. Wolff S.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 16Monnier V.M.

Investig. 2001; 107: 799-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) can generate hydroxyl radical or a related species in vitro. Our observations suggest a novel pathway for glucose-mediated protein damage. The pathway requires both polyunsaturated fatty acids and a reactive carbonyl and it involves a species resembling hydroxyl radical. Localized production of reactive intermediates by this pathway might contribute to glucose-induced retinopathy and other forms of microvascular and macrovascular disease in diabetes. Materials—Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA) supplied 13C-labeled amino acids. Isotopically labeled oxidized amino acids were prepared as described (29Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1861-1867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, all other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Aldrich Chemicals. Glycoxidation Reactions—Buffers were passed over a Chelex-100 resin column (Bio-Rad) to remove redox-active transition metal ions (30Heinecke J.W. Baker L. Rosen H. Chait A. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 77: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), and then they were filter-sterilized (0.22 μm, Corning Glass). Low density lipoprotein (LDL) was isolated rapidly from plasma obtained from normolipidemic healthy subjects using ultracentrifugation on a density gradient (31Leeuwenburgh C. Rasmussen J.E. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Pennathur S. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3520-3526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out at 37 °C under argon in buffer A (100 mm sodium phosphate, 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), pH 7.4) supplemented with either 1 mg protein/ml LDL or RNase A (fatty acid-free; Sigma). For incubations of >1 week, 1 mm sodium azide was added to the reaction mixture to prevent bacterial growth. Reactions were terminated by adding 300 nm catalase, 100 μm butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, a lipid-soluble antioxidant (30Heinecke J.W. Baker L. Rosen H. Chait A. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 77: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar); prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in 95% ethanol), and 200 μm DTPA followed by acid precipitation (27Pennathur S. Wagner J.D. Leeuwenburgh C. Litwak K.N. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For reactions involving free fatty acids, the fatty acid was dissolved in chloroform and placed in a glass scintillation vial, and the solvent was removed with nitrogen. Then the indicated reaction mixture was added, and the vial was sealed under argon and incubated at 37 °C with shaking. Model System Studies—Proteins were exposed to hydroxyl radical, tyrosyl radical, and peroxynitrite as described (27Pennathur S. Wagner J.D. Leeuwenburgh C. Litwak K.N. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). All reactions were carried out at 37 °C in buffer A supplemented with 1 mg/ml protein. Soluble retinal proteins were isolated by centrifuging homogenized rat retina at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Bovine serum albumin and soluble retinal proteins were glycated by incubation with 1 md-glucose for 6 weeks at 37 °C. Animals—The Animal Studies Committee at Washington University and the University of Texas Health Sciences Center at San Antonio approved all studies. To study the effects of hyperglycemia, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (270–300 g; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were housed individually on a 12-h light-dark cycle and allowed ad libitum access to water and rat chow (Ralston Purina, Richmond, IN). Diabetes was induced by a single intravenous injection of 50 mg of streptozotocin (STZ) (32Ido Y. Vindigni A. Chang K. Stramm L. Chance R. Heath W.F. DiMarchi R.D. Di Cera E. Williamson J.R. Science. 1997; 277: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Aminoguanidine (50 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously once daily. Diabetic animals were not treated with insulin. To study the effects of hyperlipidemia, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (210–230 g) were housed individually on a 14–10-h light-dark cycle and allowed ad libitum access to water and a low fat diet (rat chow, 4.4% fat, Harlan Teklad, Madison, Wisconsin). Hyperlipidemia was induced by consumption of a high fat diet (60% calories from fat (70% animal fat) TD97201, Harlan Teklad) for 39 weeks. Levels of hemoglobin A1C were not different between control and hyperlipidemic rats. At the end of the studies, the animals were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (32Ido Y. Vindigni A.

Tissue was harvested immediately, submerged in ice-cold antioxidant buffer, rapidly frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C until analysis. Prior to acid hydrolysis, tissue was homogenized at 4 °C in buffer B (100 μm DTPA, 50 μm BHT, 1% (v/v) ethanol,10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), frozen, and then thawed. Protein Hydrolysis—Protein was precipitated with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10% v/v), collected by centrifugation, washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and delipidated twice with water/methanol/water-washed diethyl ether (1:3:7 v/v) (33Pennathur S.

Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Amino acids were isolated from the acid hydrolysate using a solid-phase C-18 column (Supelclean SPE, Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA). The n-propyl, heptafluorobutyric anhydride derivatives of amino acids were quantified by selected ion monitoring using isotope dilution negative ion chemical ionization GC/MS (27Pennathur S.

Investig. 2001; 107: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with a Hewlett Packard 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 12 m DB-1 capillary column and interfaced with a Hewlett Packard 5988A mass spectrometer with extended mass range. Under these chromatography conditions, authentic compounds and isotopically labeled standards were base line-separated and exhibited retention times identical to those of analytes derived from tissue samples. The limit of detection (signal/noise > 10) was <10 fmol for all of the amino acids. Lipid Peroxidation—Lipids were extracted from LDL or tissue using a modified Dole procedure (34Savenkova M.L. Mueller D.M. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20394-20400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Byun J. Mueller D.M. Fabjan J.S. Heinecke J.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs) were quantified by reverse-phase C-18 HPLC analysis of triphenylphosphine-reduced lipid extracts after base hydrolysis (35Byun J. Mueller D.M. Fabjan J.S. Heinecke J.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The protein content of tissue pellets was determined by a modified Lowry protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard (36Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5319) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Results represent means ± S.E. Differences between the two groups were compared using an unpaired Student's t test. Multiple comparisons were performed using two-way analysis of variance. Correlations were determined using linear regression analysis and the Spearman rank correlation method for nonparametric data (Sigma Stat, SPSS). A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Glucose Promotes in Vitro Oxidation of LDL but Not RNase A—To explore potential mechanisms for protein oxidation by d-glucose, we incubated a model protein, RNase A, in Chelex-treated buffer A supplemented with varying concentrations of the sugar. DTPA was included in the reaction mixture to inhibit metal-catalyzed oxidation reactions. We carried out parallel experiments using LDL, a non-covalent complex of protein, cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, triglycerides, and phospholipids to investigate the potential role of lipids in protein oxidation (37Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation, proteins were isolated, delipidated, and hydrolyzed. Free amino acids isolated from the hydrolysate were subjected to isotope dilution GC/MS analysis to measure their content of ortho-tyrosine, meta-tyrosine, o,o′-dityrosine, and 3-nitrotyrosine. After exposure to 25 mmd-glucose for 15 days, LDL contained ∼40% more ortho-tyrosine and meta-tyrosine than LDL incubated in buffer alone (Fig. 1). However, the d-glucose treatment induced little change in levels of either o,o′-dityrosine or 3-nitrotyrosine. d-Glucose also failed to promote oxidation of RNase A (Fig. 1). Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that this pattern of protein oxidation products is produced by hydroxyl radical but not by tyrosyl radical or reactive nitrogen species (27Pennathur S. Wagner J.D. Leeuwenburgh C. Litwak K.N. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 38Huggins T.G. Wells-Knecht M.C. Detorie N.A. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12341-12347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of ortho-tyrosine (Fig. 2A) and meta-tyrosine (data not shown) in LDL increased with length of exposure to d-glucose, and LDL oxidation increased maximally over a range of d-glucose concentrations (5–100 mm; Fig. 2B). Previous studies have suggested that glucose could potentially contribute to LDL oxidation by a metal ion-dependent pathway (39Mowri H.O. Frei B. Keaney Jr., J.F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When DTPA was omitted from the reaction mixture, oxidation of LDL protein increased modestly (Fig. 2A) and RNase A oxidation still failed to occur, suggesting that metal ions could potentially accelerate the LDL oxidation pathway. The d-glucose-dependent increase in LDL protein oxidation, monitored as an increase in ortho-tyrosine content, also exhibited little dependence on phosphate (Fig. 2C) in contrast to protein glycoxidation (40Watkins N.G. Neglia-Fisher C.I. Dyer D.G. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7207-7212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that d-glucose can oxidize LDL by a reaction that yields ortho-tyrosine and meta-tyrosine even in the apparent absence of metal ions. The observation that LDL but not RNase A is susceptible to oxidation suggests that lipids are essential to the pathway. Glycation Fails to Generate ortho-Tyrosine and meta-Tyrosine in Model Proteins—The Schiff base adduct that d-glucose forms with proteins promotes in vitro glycoxidation reactions much more effectively than d-glucose itself (6Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar, 28Monnier V.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 799-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 41Wolff S.P. Jiang Z.Y. Hunt J.V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 10: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Certain AGEs bind metal ions, which might promote additional d-glucose oxidation and tissue damage (42Saxena A.K. Saxena P. Wu X. Obrenovich M. Weiss M.F. Monnier V.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine whether interaction of d-glucose with protein might account for the results observed in the previous experiments, extensively glycated albumin and soluble rat retinal proteins (produced by a prolonged incubation with a high concentration of d-glucose as described under “Experimental Procedures”) were incubated for up to 15 days in buffer A. However, we failed to see an increase in any of the protein oxidation products that we assayed (data not shown). We also oxidized glycated albumin and glycated rat retinal proteins with hydroxyl radical, tyrosyl radical, or peroxynitrite in vitro, but we observed the same patterns of products that appear when nonglycated proteins are exposed to these systems (data not shown). These results suggest that extensively glycated proteins alone cannot promote protein oxidation by a pathway that generates ortho-tyrosine and meta-tyrosine. Reactive Carbonyls Promote LDL Protein Oxidation in Vitro— The carbonyl group of glucose accounts for its chemical reactivity (6Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar, 7Bucala R. Cerami A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1992; 23: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 8Brownlee M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar), and levels of a variety of carbonyls derived from glucose are elevated in diabetic humans. We therefore determined whether derivatives of glucose that accumulate in diabetics, such as glyoxal and sorbitol, might facilitate protein oxidation. LDL and RNase A were incubated with 25 mmd-glucose, fructose, fructose 6-phosphate, ribose, glyoxal, glyceraldehyde, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, glycolaldehyde, or sorbitol for 15 days. Reisolated proteins were hydrolyzed and analyzed by GC/MS. More reactive carbonyls caused greater increases in levels of protein-bound ortho-tyrosine (Fig. 3) and meta-tyrosine (data not shown) in LDL. Sorbitol (which lacks a carbonyl group and contains an alcohol group but is otherwise identical to d-glucose) did not raise ortho-tyrosine or meta-tyrosine levels. None of the compounds tested oxidized RNase A (data not shown). Collectively, these observations strongly implicate a carbonyl group in oxidation of LDL protein. d-Glucose-mediated LDL Oxidation Is Accompanied by Lipid Peroxidation and Blocked by Lipid-soluble Antioxidants and Aminoguanidine—The ability of d-glucose to oxidize LDL but not RNase A suggested that lipid peroxidation might be involved. We therefore incubated LDL for 15 days in the absence or presence of 25 mmd-glucose, extracted the LDL lipids, and analyzed them for HODEs by reverse-phase HPLC. d-Glucose increased the mean concentration of HODEs from 0.93 to 1.30 nmol/mg protein (40 ± 15%, n = 3, p < 0.05). This increase was completely blocked by the lipid-soluble antioxidant BHT (100 μm), the water-soluble antioxidant ascorbate (100 μm), or the carbonyl-reactive compound aminoguanidine (1 mm). In contrast, vitamin E (100 μm), the peroxidase inhibitor azide (1 mm), the peroxide scavenger catalase (170 nm), and the superoxide scavenger superoxide dismutase (250 nm) failed to inhibit LDL oxidation, as did a combination of catalase and superoxide dismutase. These results indicate that d-glucose stimulates peroxidation of LDL lipid in vitro. Low molecular weight compounds that react with intermediates in the lipid and aqueous phase block the reaction pathway, but peroxidase inhibitors or enzymes that scavenge superoxide or hydrogen peroxide are not inhibitory. In a parallel set of experiments, we determined levels of ortho-tyrosine"

To assess the contribution of somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (SST5) to somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SST2) action in these cells, we assessed multipathway responses to novel highly monoreceptor-selective peptide agonists and multireceptor agonists, including octreotide and somatostatin-28. Octreotide and somatostatin-28 cell membrane binding affinities correlated with their respective SST2-selective peptide ligand. Although octreotide had similar inhibiting potency (picomolar) for cAMP accumulation and ACTH secretion as an SST2-selective agonist, somatostatin-28 exhibited a higher potency (femtomolar). Baseline spontaneous calcium oscillations assessed by fluorescent confocal microscopy revealed two distinct effects: SST2 activation reduced oscillations at femtomolar concentrations reflected by high inhibiting potency of averaged normalized oscillation amplitude, whereas SST5 activation induces brief oscillation pauses and increased oscillation amplitude. Octreotide exhibits an integrated effect of both receptors; however, somatostatin-28 exhibited a complex response with two separate inhibitory potencies. SST2 internalization was visualized with SST2-selective agonist at lower concentrations than for octreotide or somatostatin-28, whereas SST5 did not internalize. Using monoreceptor-selective peptide agonists, the results indicate that, in AtT-20 cells, SST5 regulates the dominant SST2 action, attenuating SST2 effects on intracellular calcium oscillation and internalization. This may explain superior somatostatin-28 potency and provides a rationale for somatostatin ligand design to treat ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors.

https://openalex.org/W2017924979,"Human papillomaviruses are the causative agents of cervical cancer. Previous studies have shown that loss of the viral E2 protein during malignant progression is an important feature of HPV-induced malignancy due to the resulting uncontrolled expression of the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7. We now show however that the viral E2 and E6 proteins are both capable of regulating each other's activity. When coexpressed, E2 and E6 induce marked changes in the pattern of each other's expression, with preferential accumulation in nuclear speckles. The two proteins interact directly, resulting in changes in the substrate specificities of E6 and the biochemical activities of E2. Thus, while E6 efficiently degrades its PDZ domain-containing substrates in the absence of E2, this activity is greatly diminished when E2 is present. Likewise, E2 alone drives both viral DNA replication and viral gene expression. However, in the presence of E6, viral DNA replication is inhibited while the transcriptional activity of E2 is elevated. These studies define a far more complex pattern of interaction between E2 and E6 than was previously thought and redefines the possible consequences of loss of E2 with respect to uncontrolled E6 activity and consequent malignant progression."
https://openalex.org/W2045092502,"Prostaglandins mediate autacrine and paracrine signaling over short distances. We used the renal collecting duct as a model system to test the hypothesis that local control of prostaglandin signaling is achieved by expressing inactivation in the same cell as synthesis. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrated that renal collecting ducts in situ express the prostaglandin (PG) synthesis enzyme, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), as well as both components of prostaglandin metabolic inactivation, i.e. the prostaglandin uptake carrier prostaglandin transporter (PGT) and the enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase. We characterized this system further using the collecting duct cell line Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), which retains COX-2 and prostaglandin dehydrogenase expression but which has lost PGT expression. When we reintroduced PGT, it was correctly sorted to the apical membrane where it altered the sidedness of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release, a process we call “vectorial release via sided reuptake.” Importantly, although COX-2 and prostaglandin dehydrogenase are expressed in the same MDCK cell, they must be compartmentalized because even in the presence of excess dehydrogenase newly synthesized PGE2 is released largely un-oxidized. However, when PGE2 undergoes first release and then PGT-mediated reuptake, significant oxidation takes place, suggesting that PGT imports PGE2 into the prostaglandin dehydrogenase compartment. Our data are consistent with a new model that offers significant new mechanisms for the fine control of eicosanoid signaling.

Prostaglandins (PGs) 1The abbreviations used are: PG, prostaglandin; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; PGT, prostaglandin transporter; PGDH, prostaglandin dehydrogenase; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; COX, cyclooxygenase. represent an extreme example of context-dependent autacrine or paracrine signaling. A single type of prostaglandin, PGE2, can activate any of four receptor subtypes (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) so as to mediate changes in physiological function as diverse as gastric acid secretion, body temperature, intraocular pressure, blood pressure, and airway reactivity (1.Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 2.Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F12-F23PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Serhan C.N. Levy B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8609-8611Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Even within a single organ, such as the kidney, PGE2 has diverse effects including afferent arteriolar vasodilatation, reduction of NaCl resorption by the thick ascending limb of Henle, vasodilatation of medullary vasa rectae, and inhibition of osmotic water flow in the cortical collecting duct (2.Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F12-F23PubMed Google Scholar). On a smaller scale, the renal collecting expresses luminal EP4 receptors, activation of which increases Na+ reabsorption and increases water reabsorption, and basolateral EP1 receptors, activation of which signals the opposite effects (4.Sakairi Y. Jacobson H.R. Noland T.D. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F257-F265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Ando Y. Asano Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1093-F1101PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, to achieve the requisite fidelity in PGE2 signaling, rapid inactivation must occur. PG inactivation involves active uptake into the cell followed by cytoplasmic oxidation (6.Schuster V.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 221-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our laboratory identified the prostaglandin transporter PGT (Slc21a2; oatp2A1) (7.Kanai N. Lu R. Satriano J.A. Bao Y. Wolkoff A.W. Schuster V.L. Science. 1995; 268: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), which is the lead candidate for the uptake step. Targeted deletion of mouse PGT results in death at post-natal day 1, most likely the result of an inability to inactivate circulating PGE2. 2H. Y. Chang, M. L. Pucci, J. Locker, R. Lu, and V. L. Schuster, unpublished data. The enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) has been extensively characterized by others (8.Ensor C.M. Tai H.H. J. Lipid Mediat. 1995; 12: 313-319Google Scholar). Indeed, we recently reconstituted the two-step model of PG metabolism by co-expressing PGT and PGDH in cells otherwise lacking these elements; in this system, exogenously added PGE2 was efficiently taken up and oxidized to the inactive metabolite (9.Nomura T. Lu R. Pucci M.L. Schuster V.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The need for prostanoid inactivation over very short distances raises the possibility that PG synthesis and the PG inactivation coexist in close proximity. In accord with this hypothesis, in the present study we identified the components of both PGE2 synthesis and PGE2 inactivation in the collecting duct and went on to examine whether PG synthesis and inactivation can occur within the same collecting duct cell. Immunocytochemistry of Endogenous PGDH and PGT in Rat Kidney—Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighting 180–250 g were anesthetized with Nembutal. Immediately after exteriorization kidney tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h and then washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Sections 5 μm thick were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated through graded ethanols to water, and equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline. Sections were pretreated for 20 min by steaming in 0.01 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min; 5% bovine serum albumin and 2% normal goat serum were used to block nonspecific antibody binding. For PGT, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal antibody #20 as straight hybridoma supernatatant (10.Bao Y. Pucci M.L. Chan B.S. Lu R. Ito S. Schuster V.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F1103-F1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For PGDH and cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit antiserum to PGDH (catalog number 160615, 1:100) or with rabbit anti-mouse COX-1 (catalog number 160109, 1:500), respectively (Cayman Chemical). In all cases, negative controls consisted of omission of the primary antibody. Sections were then incubated with either biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG, respectively (Vector Laboratories, 1:500), for 1 h at room temperature, and antibody sites were visualized by incubating in avidin-biotin peroxidase complex solution (ABC complex, Vectastain, Vector Laboratories) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Dako Corp., Caepinteria, CA). Counter-staining was done with hematoxylin (Harris Hematoxylin, Poly Scientific, Bay Shore, NY). Survey and photomicroscopy were performed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope at a magnification of ×630. Release of PGE2 and PGE2 Metabolite from MDCK Monolayers—For immunoassays, the levels of PGE2 and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2 in collected solutions were determined using the prostaglandin E2 and Bicyclo prostaglandin E2 enzyme immunoassay kits according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cayman Chemical). All release values were calculated as fmol per mg of protein per 10 min from duplicate monolayers. Agonist-induced PGE2 release experiments were performed by rapid washing with Waymouth solution followed by addition of 1 μm bradykinin or 1 unit/ml thrombin in 1 ml of Waymouth solution added to the apical side and 2 ml added to the basolateral side. After 10 min at 37 °C, the release was terminated by collecting the incubation solutions, after which the monolayers were lysed with 0.5% SDS, 0.1 n NaOH for protein assay. Cloning and Characterization of Human PGDH cDNA and Transient Overexpression in MDCK Cells—The sequence of human NAD+-dependent PGDH (8.Ensor C.M. Tai H.H. J. Lipid Mediat. 1995; 12: 313-319Google Scholar) was used to search the NCBI data base. A human pancreas adenocarcinoma expressed sequence tag clone in the vector pOTB7 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) (ATCC no. 5793242). The cDNA insert was sequenced in both directions and subjected to restriction mapping, followed by sequence analysis using MacVector and Geneworks software programs. The cDNA contained the entire coding region (798 bp) of the human PGDH. The total size of the cDNA was 2.6 kb. The sequence of the 266-amino acid open reading frame was the same as that reported by Ensor except for one nucleotide change at codon 52, CAG, which did not result in an alteration of the deduced amino acid sequence (11.Ensor C.M. Yang J.Y. Okita R.T. Tai H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14888-14891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length human PGDH cDNA in the vector pOTB7 was subcloned into the vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) at BamHI and XhoI sites and was used for the transient transfection of MDCK Tet-Off cells. Transient Expression of PGDH in MDCK Tet-Off Cell Monolayers Grown on Filters—MDCK Tet-Off cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 μg/ml puromycin, and 1 μg/ml doxycycline. The cells were seeded on Nunc tissue culture inserts at 4.0 × 105 cells/insert without doxycycline (Clontech). The day after splitting, when the cells were ∼40% confluent, they were transiently transfected with rPGT cloned in pcDNA3, pcDNA3 vector alone, full-length human PG15DH cloned in pCR3.1, or both plasmid DNA as described previously (9.Nomura T. Lu R. Pucci M.L. Schuster V.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Three days after transfection, intact monolayers had formed and were assayed for the agonist-induced PGE2 release from the co-transfected cells. Northern Blot and Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis of Endogenous PGDH Expression in MDCK Cells—The 3′-untranslated region of the human PGDH cDNA was removed at the EcoRI site close to the 3′-end within the open reading frame, and the remaining cDNA was subcloned into pCR3.1 at EcoRI sites of both ends. The direction of the cDNA was deteremined by DNA sequencing. This construct, in turn, was linearized with XhoI to form a template, and antisense digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probe was generated with T7 RNA polymerase (Genius 4 kit, Roche Applied Science). Tet-Off PGT-green fluorescent protein MDCK clone 5, or control MDCK Tet-Off cells (Clontech), were seeded on Nunc tissue culture inserts at 4.0 × 105 cells/insert with or without doxycycline. Five days later, total RNA was prepared by guanidinium acid phenol extraction (12.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA was separated by glyoxal agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a Nytran N membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridized overnight at 62 °C in 5 × SSC, 50% formamide, 2% blocking reagent, 0.1% N-lauroyl sarcosine, 0.02% SDS, 0.01 m EDTA with 100 ng/ml of the digoxigenin labeled RNA probe. Membranes were washed twice in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS; twice in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS; and twice in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 62 °C. Detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibody (Fab fragments, Roche Applied Science). Signals were visualized by chemiluminescence autoradiography (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The extent of loading of lanes was established by methylene blue staining. RNA extracted from MDCK cells was reverse-transcribed and subjected to reverse transcription-PCR using primers based on the cDNA sequence of human PGDH (forward primer, 5′-TGACCAGCAACAACTGAGAGACAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AATGATGCCGCCTTCACCTC-3′). The initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 60 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. A final extension at 72 °C was performed for 10 min. The PCR product, which migrated at ∼200 bp, was subcloned into the TA cloning vector pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen) and was sequenced from the both end. Statistical Analysis—Comparisons were analyzed by paired t test, Wilcoxon ranked test, or one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. Cyclooxygenase, the prostaglandin transporter PGT, and the enzyme PGDH are co-expressed in renal collecting ducts To test the hypothesis that PG synthesis and PG metabolic clearance may occur in the same cell, we examined renal cortical collecting ducts, a site of COX expression and PGE2 synthesis (13.Smith W.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). PGT was expressed at the apical membrane as reported previously by our laboratory (10.Bao Y. Pucci M.L. Chan B.S. Lu R. Ito S. Schuster V.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F1103-F1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). PGDH was expressed throughout the cytoplasm of cortical collecting duct cells. There was also weaker, punctate labeling for PGDH in proximal tubules. MDCK Cells Are an in Vitro Model System for the Collecting Duct—To study the functional ramifications of the above findings, we used MDCK cells grown on permeable supports. Although of collecting duct origin (22.Valentich J.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1981; 372: 384-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23.Devuyst O. Beauwens R. Denef J.F. Crabbe J. Abramow M. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 277: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), MDCK cells have lost expression of PGT. 3T. Nomura, H. Y. Chang, R. Lu, and V. L. Schuster, unpublished observations. To reconstitute the endogenous system, we established stable MDCK cell lines in which green fluorescent protein-tagged rat PGT, or a non-functional mutant (R560N) (24.Chan B.S. Bao Y. Itoh S. Lu R. Schuster V.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9215-9221Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), is expressed under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter. As with transient PGT expression (25.Endo S. Nomura T. Chan B.S. Lu R. Pucci M.L. Bao Y. Schuster V.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F618-F622PubMed Google Scholar), these cell Tet-controllable cell lines express PGT at the apical membrane, where it mediates the active uptake of PGE2 from the apical medium. In addition, they synthesize PGE2 from COX-2 (see supplemental data). Net PGE2 Release in Filter-grown MDCK Cells Is Modulated by PGT-mediated Reuptake—To examine whether apical PGT carries out reuptake of endogenous prostaglandins released into the medium, we stimulated the cells with bradykinin (1 μm, 10 min) or thrombin (1 unit/ml, 10 min) (26.Cortizo A.M. Besterman J.M. Leitner P.P. Chandrabose K.A. Prostaglandins. 1992; 44: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and determined net PGE2 release. Fig. 2A shows that, although the various MDCK clones expressing wild type rat PGT, inactive R560N PGT, or empty Tet-Off vector were each associated with different overall levels of PGE2 release upon bradykinin stimulation, there was no effect of PGT expression (i.e. ±doxycycline) on the total amount of PGE2 released. Similar results were obtained with 1 unit/ml thrombin (data not shown). Despite the fact that overall PGE2 release was not affected by PGT expression, the sidedness of PGE2 release was altered. Net release of PGE2 into the apical compartment of the filter apparatus, as a fraction of the total PGE2 release, was significantly reduced when PGT expression was induced at the apical plasma membrane by doxycycline withdrawal. This resulted in a significant reduction in the apical-to-basal release ratio (Fig. 2B). Induction of PGT reduced the average apical PGE2 release from 1714 to 573 fmol/mg of protein/10 min and increased the average basolateral PGE2 release from 691 to 1307 fmol/mg of protein/10 min. The most likely explanation for these results is that PGT scavenges PGE2 from the apical solution and brings it back into the cell, whereupon it has another chance to exit by diffusion across the basolateral membrane. PGT expression did not change COX expression, a possible alternative explanation (data not shown). PGE2 Taken Back Up by PGT Is at Least Partially Oxidized to the 15-Keto Metabolite by Endogenous PGDH—Given that renal collecting ducts in vivo express PGDH (Fig. 1C), we considered the possibility that PGE2 taken back up by MDCK cells might undergo partial intracellular oxidation. Fig. 3A shows the appearance in the medium of the PGE2 metabolite 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2 as assayed by enzyme immunoassay. Induction of PGT expression by doxycycline removal resulted in a roughly 4-fold increase in the appearance of this PGE2 metabolite. The average PGT-induced fall in apical PGE2 was 1140 fmol/mg of protein/10 min, and the average total rise in 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2 (apical + basolateral) after PGT induction was 296 fmol/mg of protein/10 min, indicating that about 23% of PGE2 taken up by PGT was oxidized. Further quantitative considerations raised the possibility that metabolites other than 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2 might be formed: induction of PGT expression reduced the apical [PGE2 + PGE2 metabolite] from 1756 ± 774 to 649 ± 185 fmol/mg of protein/10 min (mean decrease = 1107) but only increased the basolateral [PGE2 + PGE2 metabolite] from 760 ± 513 to 1638 ± 837 fmol/mg of protein/10 min (mean increase = 878). However, when we incubated the cells in a mixture of PGE2, d4-PGE2, and [3H]PGE2 and analyzed the products formed in response to PGT expression using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, the results showed that only 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2 is formed following PGE2 reuptake (see supplemental data). PG Synthesis and PG Reuptake and Metabolism Are Compartmentalized in MDCK Cells—The presence of enzymatically active PGDH in a cell that is also engaged in PGE2 synthesis raises the question of whether newly synthesized PGE2 is subject to oxidation before it is released. To address this question further, we forced the system toward even more oxidation by overexpressing exogenous PGDH. In the presence of excess PGDH, PGT continued to significantly shift the direction of PGE2 release away from the apical and toward the basal side, as was the case without exogenous PGDH, and the combination of PGT and PGDH resulted in an ∼4-fold increase in the appearance of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2 into the medium (see supplemental data). A critical element of these experiments is shown in Fig. 4. Bradykinin did not generate significant PGE2 metabolite above base line unless PGT was also present, even in the presence of excess PGDH. These data argue against significant access of newly synthesized PGE2 to PGDH. Rather, they suggest that access of PGE2 to PGDH requires first the release of PGE2 into the medium, followed by PGT-mediated reuptake into the cell. This study addresses the question of whether PG synthesis and PG inactivation co-exist within the same cell. Rat kidney collecting ducts were shown to strongly express COX plus the two components of PG inactivation, namely the PG uptake carrier PGT and the enzyme PGDH. Using the collecting duct cell line MDCK as an in vitro model system, we found that agonist-stimulated PG synthesis and release were followed by PGT-mediated PG reuptake and PGDH-mediated oxidation. The reuptake of released PGE2 by apical PGT shifted the polarity of net PGE2 release by the epithelium, an apparently novel mechanism of directing signaling molecules that we have called “vectorial release via sided reuptake.” Data derived from overexpression of PGDH also lead to the new hypothesis that the COX synthetic pathway must be compartmentalized relative to the PG reuptake/oxidation pathway. MDCK cells are a good model system for the collecting duct in that they share many common features (22.Valentich J.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1981; 372: 384-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23.Devuyst O. Beauwens R. Denef J.F. Crabbe J. Abramow M.

Similarly, PGT expression is lost from endothelial cells when cultured, but expression is regained when shear stress is applied (32.Adachi H. Suzuki T. Abe M. Asano N. Mizutamari H. Tanemoto M.

In MDCK cells, when PGT was reintroduced it was correctly sorted to the apical plasma membrane (see supplemental data) (25.Endo S. Nomura T. Chan B.S. Lu R. Pucci M.L. Bao Y. Schuster V.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F618-F622PubMed Google Scholar). Different PGE2 receptors that mediate opposite physiological effects are often expressed on a single cell type. For example, cultured osteoblasts express both EP1 and EP4 receptors, which signal opposite effects on DNA synthesis and alkaline phosphatase activity (36.Suda M. Tanaka K. Natsui K. Usui T. Tanaka I. Fukushima M. Shigeno C. Konishi J. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Nakao N. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Similarly, the renal collecting duct expresses apical EP4 receptors and basolateral EP1 receptors that signal opposite effects on Na+ and water transport (4.Sakairi Y. Jacobson H.R. Noland T.D. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F257-F265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Ando Y. Asano Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1093-F1101PubMed Google Scholar). Since PGE2 likely exits collecting duct cells non-directionally by simple diffusion (37.Schuster V.L. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38.Chan B.S. Satriano J.A. Pucci M.L. Schuster V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6689-6697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), one method for directing PGE2 toward basolateral (EP1) receptors would be to use an apical reuptake carrier like PGT. The reclaimed PGE2 could either be oxidized or could rediffuse intact out of the cell across the basolateral membrane. In our studies, about 75% of the PGE2 taken back up apically by PGT in MDCK cells appeared as native PGE2 in the basolateral solution. Since PGT is also expressed at the luminal membrane of endothelial cells (32.Adachi H. Suzuki T. Abe M. Asano N. Mizutamari H. Tanemoto M. Nishio T. Onogawa T. Toyohara T. Kasai S. Satoh F. Suzuki M.

Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2396-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and endothelial cells preferentially release prostanoids toward the basolateral (abluminal) side (39.Moore S.A. Spector A.A. Hart M.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C37-C44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sided PG reuptake may be a general system of directing eicosanoids toward one or another receptor population. A major finding of the present studies is that, even when PGDH is overexpressed, newly synthesized PGE2 does not appear to have significant access to the enzyme unless the PGE2 is first released and then taken up again by PGT. Taken with the other data presented here, the most likely explanation for these results is that the process of PGE2 synthesis/release is compartmentalized away from the process of PGE2 reuptake and oxidation. A release-reuptake model for PG signaling bears a resemblance to synaptic signaling (Fig. 5) in which secreted neurotransmitter is taken up by the cell that released it and then oxidized (e.g. serotonin (40.Blakely R.D.

Int. 1996; 29: 335-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), and glutamate (43.Wu S.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 141-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)). The concept of PG compartmentalization within the cell is interesting in light of recent data on PG synthases. Although originally thought to occur exclusively in the cytoplasm (44.Morita I.

DeWitt D.L. Schindler M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7194-7199Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), recent evidence suggests that PGE2 synthase consists of at least two distinct isoenzymes that are expressed in distinct locations within the cell and are coupled to different pools of arachidonic acid (46.Ueno N. Murakami M. Tanioka T. Fujimori K. Tanabe T. Urade Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34918-34927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 47.Murakami M. Nakatani Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 36897-36903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of this coupling, as well as of the compartmentation described in the present study, are unknown. The control of net PG release now appears to be more complex than previously appreciated. In addition to control steps at the level of phospholipase, COX, and the PG synthases, PG reuptake is also controlled. Unpublished work from our laboratory indicates that PGT and COX-2 expression in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts is coordinately regulated by serum. 4R. Lu, M. L. Pucci, T. Nomura, and V. L. Schuster, unpublished data. Similarly, a recent report showed that PGT and COX-2 are coordinately regulated during the estrus cycle in the bovine corpus luteum (49.Arosh J.A. Banu S.K. Chapdelaine P. Madore E. Sirois J. Fortier M.A. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2551-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We propose that carrier-mediated PG reuptake represents a level of control that is complementary to the regulation of COX-2. In summary, we have presented data in support of a new model of eicosanoid signaling in which PG synthesis and PG inactivation occur in the same cell and are segregated from each other.

https://openalex.org/W2165313420,"Evidence indicates that extracellular ATP may have relevant functions in skeletal muscle, even though the physiological role and distribution of specific signaling pathway elements are not well known. The present work shows that P2X4 receptor, an extracellular ATP-regulated cell membrane channel permeable to Ca2+, is expressed in several tissues of the rat, including skeletal muscle. A specific antibody detected a protein band of approximately 60 kDa. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that P2X4 has an intracellular localization, and confocal analysis revealed that the receptor colocalizes with the T-tubule membrane DHP receptor. Considering that the natural agonist of P2X4 is ATP, we explored if changes of extracellular ATP levels could occur in contracting skeletal muscle to regulate the channel. In vitro experiments showed that substantial ATP is released and rapidly hydrolyzed after electrical stimulation of rat muscle fibers. Results show that the presence of ATP-degrading enzymes (hexokinase/apyrase), inhibitors of P2X receptors or Ca2+-free conditions, all abolished the progressive twitch tension potentiation produced in soleus muscle by low-frequency (0.05 Hz) stimulation. These data reveal that ATP-mediated Ca2+ entry, most likely through P2X4 receptor, may play an important role in modulating the contractility of skeletal muscle."

Nuclease colicins are processed during translocation with only the cytotoxic nuclease domains traversing the inner membrane to cleave tRNA, rRNA, or DNA in the cytoplasm of target cells. In this study, we show that the E. coli periplasmic extract cleaves ColE7 between Lys446 and Arg447 in the presence or absence of its inhibitor Im7 protein. Several residues near cleavage sites were mutated, but only mutants of Arg447 completely lost in vivo cell-killing activity. Both the full-length and the nuclease domain of Arg447 mutants retained their nuclease activities, indicating that failure to kill cells was not a consequence of damage to the endonuclease activity of the enzyme. Moreover, the R447E ColE7 mutant was not cleaved at its 447 site by periplasmic extracts or transported into the cytoplasm of target cells. Collectively, these results suggest that ColE7 is cleaved at Arg447 during translocation and that cleavage is an essential step for ColE7 import into the cytoplasm of target cells and its cell-killing activity.

Protein transport mechanisms across cell or organelle membranes have been studied extensively because these processes are essential for cell survival and defense. Protein toxins provide good opportunities for the study of protein import pathways into eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells because successful transport produces an obvious cell death consequence (1Sandvig K. Falnes P.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The protein toxins specifically targeting bacterial cells are classified as bacteriocins. These toxins bind to the respective receptors on target cells and are transported across bacterial outer or, in some cases, inner cytoplasmic membranes, resulting in cell death (2Riley M.A. Wertz J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 117-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Presently, Escherichia coli-released colicins are likely the most studied subfamily of bacteriocins in terms of outer membrane receptor binding, membrane translocation, and cell killing (3Cao Z. Klebba P.E. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 399-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Zakharov S.D. Cramer W.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Colicins are SOS response proteins, expressed under stress, that kill sensitive E. coli and other related bacterial strains (6Gillor O. Kirkup B.C. Riley M.A. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 129-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Most colicins share a similar organization containing three functional domains, the receptor-binding (R), membrane translocation (T), and cytotoxic (C) domains. After secretion from the host cell, colicins first bind to specific cell surface receptors on target cells. Examples include the vitamin B12 receptor BtuB for all the E-group colicins and iron siderophore receptor FepA for colicin B (ColB) 1The abbreviations used are: Col, colicin; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and colicin D (ColD) (7Barnard T.J. Watson Jr., M.E. McIntosh M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). They are then imported into cells by two different routes, one depending on Ton proteins (ExbB, ExbD, and TonB) and the other depending on Tol proteins (TolA, -B, -Q, and -R) (8Lazzaroni J-C. Dubuisson J.-F. Vianney A. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Riley M.A. Wertz J.E. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 365-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Colicins use a variety of strategies to induce cell death through their C-domains. For example, pore-forming colicins create voltage-gated channels in the cytoplasmic membrane (4Zakharov S.D. Cramer W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and nuclease colicins cleave tRNA or rRNA at specific sites to inhibit protein synthesis (10Masaki H. Ogawa T.

Ghosh P. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and Tol-dependent rRNase ColE3 (11Soelaiman S. Jakes K. Wu N. Li C. Shoham M. Mol.

In the ColE3-Im3 structure complex, the immunity protein Im3 is bound to the C-domain to prevent access of ColE3 to the ribosome and inhibits the rRNase activity of ColE3 upon ColE3 expression in the host cell. The crystal structure of the ColE3 R-domain in complex with its BtuB receptor further demonstrates how ColE3 interacts with BtuB at its coiled-coil apex to initiate colicin conformational change and translocation (15Kurisu G. Zakharov S.D. Zhalnina M.V. Bano S. Eroukova V.Y. Rokitskaya T.I. Antonenko Y.N. Wiener M.C. Cramer W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, the crystal structures of the Tol-dependent pore-forming colicin N (16Vetter I.R. Parker M.W. Tucker A.D. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and the Ton-dependent pore-forming ColB (17Hilsenbeck J.L. Park H. Chen G. Youn B. Postle K. Kang C. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) revealed different two-domain architectures. The dumbbell-shaped ColB has its T- and R-domains intertwining into a single large globular structure, suggesting that different colicins may have different mechanisms of translocation even though they use similar transporters. After import into the periplasm, the nuclease colicins, containing rRNase, tRNase, or nuclease activities (DNase/RNase), have to transport further across the inner membrane to reach the cytoplasm of target cells. It has been shown that nuclease colicin ColE7 is likely processed in the periplasm during translocation with only the C-terminal cytotoxic nuclease domain transported into the cytoplasm (18Liao C-C. Hsia K.-C. Liu Y.-W. Liang P.H. Yuan H.S. Chak K.-F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The tRNase colicin, ColD, was also reported to be cleaved during translocation and a leader peptidase, LepB, was identified as required in the processing (19de Zamaroczy M. Mora L. Lecuyer A. Geli V. Buckingham R.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to ColE7, which is processed in the presence of the immunity protein Im7, the immunity protein of ColD was found to prevent ColD processing. It was thus suggested that the immunity protein may not only inhibit tRNase activity but also protect ColD against LepB-mediated cleavage during export. Based on these results, it is generally accepted that nuclease colicins are processed during translocation but the cleavage sites in colicins and the component proteins involved in the processing have not yet been clearly elucidated. This report identifies the cleavage site at Arg447 in ColE7 during translocation and demonstrates that this cleavage is essential for ColE7 translocation and its cell-killing properties. A conserved basic residue was identified in a number of nuclease colicins, implying that a similar cleavage process may be involved for all these colicins during translocation. Protein Expression and Purification—DNA fragments encoding the full-length ColE7 and Im7 (20Chak K-F. Kuo W.-S. Lu F.-M. James R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and the C-domain of ColE7 and Im7 were first amplified by PCR and then subcloned between the SphI and BglII sites of pQE70. All mutants of ColE7-Im7 and C-domain-Im7 were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kits (Invitrogen). The E. coli strain M15 was used as the host strain for protein expression. Full-length ColE7—Overnight cultures of E. coli cells were diluted 100-fold in 1 liter of LB containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were grown at 37 °C to 0.6 O.D. (A600), after which isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce protein expression. Crude cell extracts were first loaded onto a Ni-NTA resin affinity column (Qiagen) followed by a CarboxyMethyl column (Amersham Biosciences). Purified full-length ColE7-Im7 complexes were denatured with 6 m guanidine-HCl and further separated on a Ni-NTA spin column (Qiagen). The flow-through containing full-length ColE7 alone was dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 10 mm ZnCl2. ColE7 C-domain—ColE7 C-domain and Im7 fused with a His6 affinity tag at the C terminus were expressed in the same E. Coli M15 strain. After Ni-NTA affinity column purification, the protein complex was denatured by dialysis against 20 mm glycine-HCl buffer (pH 3.0) overnight. The resulting protein solution was loaded onto a Sepharose-SP column (HiTrap SP, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm glycine-HCl buffer (pH 3.0). The C-domain alone was eluted by an NaCl gradient (0–2.0 m, pH 3.0), and Im7 was eluted afterward by 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The eluent containing the ColE7 C-domain was dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Preparation of Periplasmic Extracts—A published method was used for the preparation of periplasmic proteins by osmotic shock (21Witholt B. Boekhout M. Brock M. Kingma J. Heerikhuizen H.V. Leij L.D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Ten milliliters of fresh overnight E. coli (M15 strain) cell culture was diluted into 200 ml of LB and incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. Cells were harvested and suspended in 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) followed by an addition of the same volume of the buffer containing 200 ml Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 m sucrose. A final concentration of 0.5 mm EDTA was then added, resulting in a suspension containing ∼5–20 mg/ml cells in 0.5 m sucrose. Lysozyme was then added into the cell suspension to a final concentration of 60 μg/ml. The same volume of water was then added to the cell suspension and the reaction kept for 10 min at room temperature. MgSO4 was then added to a final concentration of 20 mm. The osmotic shock fluid containing periplasmic proteins was collected by centrifugation. The periplasmic extracts were further concentrated to 1 mg/ml by Centriprep (Millipore) followed by extensive dialysis against buffers containing 20 mm MES (pH 6.0) and 150 mm NaCl. In Vitro Processing of ColE7—The purified ColE7-Im7 complex (3 μg) was mixed with 1 μg of the concentrated periplasmic extracts at pH 6.0 and incubated at 37 °C for various periods of time (∼2–12 h). The processed protein products were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semi-dry apparatus (American Bionetics). The membrane was hybridized with polyclonal antibodies raised against the ColE7 C-domain followed by goat anti-IgG antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Promega). The blot was visualized by nitro blue tetrazolinm/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The desired fragment was eluted from a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane after staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and verified by N-terminal sequencing (492 Protein Sequencer, ABI). In Vivo Cell Death Assay—Purified full-length wild-type or mutated ColE7-Im7 complexes were serially diluted in sodium phosphate buffers. A drop of 20 μl of ColE7-Im7 solution was spotted at each dilution onto a disk filter paper placed in freshly prepared bacterial lawns on ampicillin LB agar plates. Plates were then incubated overnight at 37 °C. E. coli M15 containing pQE70 was used for the cell death assay. Circular Dichroism and Tryptophan Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism measurements were performed at 25 °C using a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter. The spectra presented in Fig. 3 were the average of three scans in units of mean residue ellipticity (θ). The protein concentration was 0.04 mg/ml in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). Measurements of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission of full-length ColE7-Im7 complex were performed on a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrometer using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm at 25 °C. The excitation bandwidth was set at 5 nm and the emission bandwidth at 10 nm. The protein concentrations were 0.04 mg/ml each in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). DNase Activity Assay—The purified full-length ColE7 (15 ng) was incubated with pUC18 plasmid in a final volume of 10 μl at 37 °C for ∼2–3 h. The amount of ColE7 C-domain was first adjusted to between ∼0.12 and 120 ng by series dilution and then incubated with the pQE70 plasmid at room temperature for 5 min. The plasmid digestion patterns were analyzed on 1% agarose gels. DNase Activity Measured by Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Methods—Thedouble-stranded DNA substrate labeled with fluorogenic material FAM (6-carboxyl-fluorescein) and TAMRA (6-carboxyl-tetramethyl-rhodamine) at the 5′ end was prepared by Biotech (Taiwan). FAM−5'−CCACAGGTAGCGACAG−3'3'−GGTGTCCATCGCTGTC−5'−TAMRASequence I Kinetic measurements were performed in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 1 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C. Enhanced fluorescence, a result of cleavage of the fluorogenic double-stranded DNA substrate, was monitored at 515 nm, with excitation at 486 nm using a fluorescence plate reader (PerkinElmer 1420 Victor2 mutilabel counter). The enzyme concentration used in measuring Km and kcat values was 20 nm with varied substrate concentrations of 9.75, 19.14, 47.85, 71.78, 95.7, 143.55, and 191.4 nm. Identification of ColE7 Translocation Products—A method reported previously (18Liao C-C. Hsia K.-C. Liu Y.-W. Liang P.H. Yuan H.S. Chak K.-F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was used to extract the final processed ColE7 from the cytoplasm of target cells. A cell culture of 200 ml of E. coli M15 containing a plasmid encoding His-tagged Im7 (pQE30-cei) was treated with 5 mg of ColE7-Im7 complex for 4 h. The treated cell culture was harvested and washed twice with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) followed with 10 mg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 37 °C to remove residual proteins bound on the cell surface. The proteinase K-treated cells were harvested and washed twice with the same buffer and then resuspended in 3 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) containing 300 mm NaCl and protease inhibitor complex (Roche Complete, EDTA-free). Cells were disrupted by sonication and the insoluble fractions removed by centrifugation. The soluble fractions were then loaded onto a Ni-NTA spin column (Qiagen). The His-tagged Im7 and any pull-down proteins from the spin column were eluted by 500 mm imidazole. Im7-associated proteins were identified by Western blot hybridization with polyclonal antibodies against the C-domain of ColE7. Periplasmic Proteins Cleave ColE7 at Arg447 in the Presence or Absence of Im7—To ascertain the location of ColE7 processing sites, a full-length ColE7-Im7 complex was incubated with E. coli periplasmic extracts prepared by osmotic shock (21Witholt B. Boekhout M. Brock M. Kingma J. Heerikhuizen H.V. Leij L.D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The quality of the periplasmic extract prepared from the E. coli M15 strain containing a plasmid encoding His-tagged Im7 was checked by Western blot hybridization using the cytoplasmic antibody markers against GroEL and His tags. Both GroEL and His-tagged Im7 were detected in total cell extracts and cytoplasmic fractions but were not detected in periplasmic fractions, indicating that the prepared periplasmic fraction was not contaminated by cytoplasmic proteins (Fig. 1A). After incubation with the cell fractions for 12 h, ColE7 was mostly cleaved by the periplasmic extract but not by cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 1B). The ColE7-Im7 was then further incubated with periplasmic extracts over different periods of time (2–12 h) in the presence or absence of metalloprotease inhibitors and EDTA. The processed ColE7 products were separated using SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot hybridization using an antibody raised against the ColE7 C-domain, revealing a processed fragment with a size similar to the constructed nuclease domain (Fig. 1C). The addition of EDTA but not serine or cysteine protease inhibitors inhibited the processing, implying that the processing might involve metalloproteases. The processed ColE7 product was then extracted from the SDS-PAGE and analyzed by N-terminal sequencing, revealing the first five residues of the processed ColE7 as RNKPG, corresponding to residues Arg447 to Gly451. Therefore the ColE7 cleavage site lay between Lys446 and Arg447, located in a region between its R-domain and C-domain. By incubating the free form of ColE7 (without Im7) with periplasmic extracts, we found the processing pattern (Fig. 1D) similar to that of the ColE7-Im7 complex. This result shows that periplasmic extracts cleave ColE7 between Lys446 and Arg447 in the presence or absence of bound Im7. Arg447 ColE7 Mutants Lose in Vivo Cell-killing Activity— Several single- or double-point ColE7 mutants were constructed to determine which of the amino acids flanking the Lys446-Arg447 cleavage site, including K446E, R447E, N448A, and K446E/R447E, would affect cleavage. In the cell death assay, wild-type ColE7-Im7, spotted on a disk filter paper placed in an agar plate seeded with E. coli M15 strains, killed cells and gave a clear region around the filter paper. However, two of the mutants with mutations at the 447 site, R447E and K446E/R447E, failed to kill target bacteria, as evidenced by the lack of a clear region surrounding the disk (Fig. 2A). In contrast, K446E and N448A mutants retained significant cell-killing activities. Arg447 was then further mutated to a similar basic residue (Lys) or to a noncharged residue (Ala). However, neither R447K nor R447A killed any cells even upon application at high concentrations (Fig. 2B). This result demonstrates the critical importance of Arg447 in mediating the cell-killing activity of ColE7 in vivo. Circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy were used to detect any conformational changes in Arg447 mutants (Fig. 3). No obvious differences were detected in secondary and tertiary structures between wild-type ColE7 and Arg447 mutants, indicating that the failure to kill cells, as exhibited by Arg447 mutants, was likely not to be because of any change in protein conformation. Arg447 ColE7 Mutants Retain DNase Activity—Because it was possible that the Arg447 mutants lacked cell lethality as a result of losing their endonuclease activity, full-length wild-type and mutated ColE7 proteins were prepared and purified for nuclease activity assays. Plasmids pUC18 or pQE70 were used as substrates to monitor ColE7 endonuclease activity from any DNA topological changes seen in agarose gel electrophoresis. Fig. 4A shows that the supercoiled plasmid was cleaved into linear/open circular forms by either wild-type or mutated ColE7 (K446E, R447E, and K446E/R447E). The wild-type nuclease domain of ColE7 (residues 444–576) and the corresponding R447A mutant were further constructed and purified. These two C-domain proteins also cleaved the plasmid substrate efficiently (Fig. 4B). Nevertheless, the R447A C-domain had ∼10-fold lower endonuclease activity than the wild-type protein. The catalytic activities of wild-type and mutant C-domains were further measured by a fluorescent method using a fluorophore and quencher-labeled oligonucleotide as the substrate. For a control to compare with Arg447 mutants, a mutant, N560D, was selected for the measurement of enzyme and cell-killing activity. Asn560 is a conserved residue in the HNH motif located in the C-domain of ColE7; therefore, the mutant N560D was expected to have reduced endonuclease activity. Cleavage of the fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides by the C-domain proteins gave increasing fluorescence emission intensities. The measured intensities showed that R447A C-domain had 15% and N560D C-domain had 0.7% of wild-type enzyme activity (Table I). The reduced catalytic activity of R447A was not because of any decrease in enzyme activity but mostly resulted from an increased Km, indicating that the affinity between R447A and DNA was lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. N560D mutant, with a much lower overall endonuclease activity of only 0.7%, was still able to kill target cells (Fig. 2C), indicating that any failure to kill cells by Arg447 mutants did not result from any reduction in endonuclease activity.Table IThe endonuclease activity of the wild-type and mutated nuclease domain of ColE7 as measured by the fluorescence resonance energy transfer methodProteinkcatKmkcat/KmRelative activity toward a 16-bp dsDNAaDouble-stranded DNA.10-3/s-1nm104 m-1 s-1%Wild typeaDouble-stranded DNA.1.8127.251.95100R447A1.09105.500.3015.4N560A0.02144.000.0140.7b The wild-type nuclease domain of ColE7 contains residues from 444 to 576.a Double-stranded DNA. Open table in a new tab b The wild-type nuclease domain of ColE7 contains residues from 444 to 576. ColE7 R447E Mutants Are Not Imported into Cytoplasm or Processed at the 447 Site—To further elucidate the underlying cause for the failure of Arg447 mutants to kill cells, the imported ColE7 in the cytoplasm of target cells was characterized. E. coli cells containing an endogenously expressed His-tagged Im7 were treated with full-length wild-type ColE7-Im7 and R447E-Im7 complexes. The translocation product in complex with the endogenous His-tagged Im7 was then purified by Ni-NTA resin and detected by Western blot hybridization using an antibody against nuclease-ColE7. Fragments of nuclease domains were detected in target cells treated with wild-type ColE7-Im7 complex. However, no nuclease domain fragments were detected in the cells treated with R447E-Im7 complex (Fig. 5A). This result indicates that the ColE7 R447E mutant was not imported into the cytoplasm of target cells in the same manner as that of wild-type ColE7. It was intriguing that ColE7 Arg447 mutant was not imported into the cytoplasm of target cells. It is thus necessary to determine whether R447E could be processed correctly in periplasm, because the incorrect processing may lead to the failure in import. Full-length ColE7 R447E mutant was incubated with periplasmic extracts, and the digested protein products were separated in SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot hybridization (Fig. 5B). The R447E mutant was not cleaved between Lys446 and Glu447. However, a larger fragment was found, resulting from a cut between Lys438 and Ala439 as analyzed by the N-terminal sequencing. This result suggests that cleavage at Arg447 is necessary for ColE7 import into target cells, and that is why the mutant R447E, not processed at 447, was not imported into the cytoplasm. Specific Cleavage at Arg447 in ColE7 Is Required for Cell-killing Activity—The nuclease colicins acting in the cytoplasm of sensitive bacterial cells have to traverse the second inner membrane, and as a result they require additional steps in translocation as compared with pore-forming colicins. Here we present evidence demonstrating that cleavage between Lys446 and Arg447 in ColE7 is essential for its import into the cytoplasm of sensitive cells. The arginine at the P1′ site (cleavage between P1 and P1′) is of critical importance, because replacing it with other residues abolished the specific cleavage and protein translocation, resulting in a non-lethal colicin. This cleavage is independent of immunity protein, i.e. Im7 cannot protect ColE7 from this cleavage. This cleavage process occurs extracellularly, most likely in the periplasm of sensitive cells. However, because outer membrane-associated proteins may have also been extracted under the preparation conditions used in the isolation of periplasmic extracts, it cannot be excluded that cleavage may take place during ColE7 translocation across the outer membrane. If one compares Arg447 cleavage in ColE7 with the LepB-mediated cleavage in ColD during translocation (19de Zamaroczy M. Mora L. Lecuyer A. Geli V. Buckingham R.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), similar features can be found. Firstly, the cleavages of ColD and ColE7 are required for their import into cytoplasm and for their cell-killing activity. Secondly, several single, double, and triple mutants have been constructed for ColD, but only the mutants in which the basic residue Lys603 was replaced (R602L/K603E and R602L/K603E/L596P) were not cleaved, similar to the Arg447 mutants in ColE7. However, cleavage of ColD by whole cell extracts was inhibited by the immunity protein and mediated by an inner-membrane-associated peptidase (19de Zamaroczy M. Mora L. Lecuyer A. Geli V. Buckingham R.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which was not present in the periplasmic extract used in this analysis. Moreover, the signal peptidase LepB is a serine protease but not a metalloprotease. However, the processing of ColE7 by periplasmic extracts is inhibited by EDTA, indicating that a metalloprotease may be involved. Therefore, it is likely that the observed cleavages in ColE7 and ColD occur at different stages or are processed by different proteins during translocation. The difference observed in processing may also be a consequence of two different types of colicins using two different translocation pathways for import: the nuclease ColE7 depending on Tol proteins and tRNase ColD depending on TonB. Cleavage Site in ColE7 Is Located in a Linker Region between R-domain and C-domain—The crystal structure of an E-group rRNase colicin, ColE3, has been determined. ColE3 shares high sequence identity with ColE7 in the T- and R-domains (75.4% identity). We therefore constructed a ColE7 structure model by fusing the crystal structure of ColE3 T- and R-domain (Protein Data Bank accession number 1JCH) to the crystal structure of a ColE7 C-domain (the nuclease domain) in complex with Im7 (Protein Data Bank accession number 7CEI) (11Soelaiman S. Jakes K. Wu N. Li C. Shoham M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Ko T.-P. Liao C.-C. Ku W.-Y. Chak K.-F. Yuan H.S. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The overall structure and a closer view of the endonuclease active site in ColE7 are shown in Fig. 6. In the crystal structure of ColE7 C-domain (Protein Data Bank accession number 1MZ8), Arg447 hydrogen bonds to the phosphate ion mimicking the scissile phosphate that is directly bound to the metal ion in the active site (23Sui M-J. Tsai L.-C. Hsia K.-C. Doudeva L.-G. Chak K.-F. Yuan H.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2947-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This explains why the R447A mutant has a lower affinity for DNA substrates even though it retains endonuclease activity, because Arg447 indeed is involved in DNA binding but not directly involved in catalysis. The location of Arg447 in the exposed linker region seems ideal for protease processing. This site is distant from Im7, which is consistent with the fact that Im7 cannot protect ColE7 from cleavage. From comparisons of ColE7 sequence with those of other nuclease colicins, the conserved basic residues arginine or lysine are seen to align at the same position as Arg447 for all the Tol-dependent colicins. The E-group rRNase (E3, E4, E6) and tRNase (E5) colicins, all have a lysine, whereas the nonspecific nuclease colicins (E2, E7, E8, and E9) all have an arginine at this position (Fig. 6C, red box). The Tol-dependent DF13, which binds to the receptor IutA (24Thomas J.A. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 548-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also shares high sequence homology with the E-group colicins in this linker region, and DF13 also has a lysine aligned with Arg447 in ColE7. This implies that the cleavage observed in ColE7 at Arg447 may be common to other Tol-dependent enzymatic colicins. The Ton-dependent nuclease colicin ColD shares low sequence homology with ColE7. However, it will be interesting to learn whether ColD requires cleavage at Lys603 for translocation. Additional experiments are needed to find out whether the processing seen for ColE7 at the Arg447 site is general for the import of all enzymatic colicins and the protein components involved in this process."

Studies of knockout mice also revealed an unexpected functional diversity among the p53 family. To determine how p63 and p73 are involved in tumorigenesis and normal development, we used cDNA microarray to examine 9216 genes in human colorectal cancer cells. We discovered that the expression of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) was specifically induced by either p63 or p73, but not by p53. We also report here that the PEDF gene contains a response element specific for p63 and p73 in its promoter region and is a direct target of p63 and p73. Collectively, p63 and p73 may be involved in cell fate by inducing PEDF expression."
https://openalex.org/W2019681296,"The EF-hand protein, S100A4, binds calcium ions and interacts specifically in vitro with protein targets. Elevated levels of S100A4 have been shown to produce a metastatic phenotype in independent models of breast cancer. The presence of S100A4 in the carcinoma cells of patients with different carcinomas is associated with reduced patient survival. In order to identify the region of the S100A4 molecule that is responsible for its metastasis-inducing properties, specific mutant S100A4 genes and proteins have been produced which contain targeted mutations to the two calcium-binding sites and a deletion of the last 15 amino-acid residues of the protein. The ability of the mutant proteins to bind to a potential specific target in vitro, nonmuscle myosin heavy chain, is correlated with their ability to cause motile, invasive and metastatic phenotypes. Mutation of the C-EF hand of S100A4 virtually abolished calcium binding and motility/invasion in vitro, abolished interaction with a molecular target and reduced metastasis induction by 2.5–3-fold. However, deletion of the last 15 amino acids of S100A4 reduced motility/invasion, target binding and metastasis-induction to similar extents as the C-EF-hand mutant, but reduced calcium binding by only 26%. The results suggest that the ability to interact with protein target(s) is important in S100A4-induced metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2152731121,"The RUNX1/AML1 gene on chromosome 21 is most frequently inactivated in human leukemias. In addition, an increased dose of RUNX1 is suggested as a basis for several kinds of leukemias. Amplifications of chromosome 21 or the RUNX1 gene are shown to be associated with leukemias with lymphoid lineage, whereas its involvement in myeloid lineage remains unclear. In this study, we generated GATA-1 promoter-driven Runx1 transgenic (Tg) mice, which showed a transient mild increase of megakaryocyte marker-positive myeloid cells but no spontaneous leukemia. These mice were then crossed with BXH2 mice, which have a replication-competent retrovirus in the mouse and develop myeloid leukemia due to insertional mutagenesis by random integration of the virus. Overexpressed Runx1 transgene in BXH2 mice resulted in shortening of the latency of leukemia with increased frequency of megakaryoblastic leukemia, suggesting that increased Runx1 dosage is leukemogenic in myeloid lineage. Identifications of retroviral integration sites revealed the genetic alterations that may cooperate with Runx1 overdose in myeloid leukemogenesis. This mouse model may be useful for analysing the pathogenesis of myeloid leukemias with RUNX1 overdose, especially to examine whether an extra-copy of RUNX1 by trisomy 21 is causally related to Down's syndrome-related acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AMKL)."

https://openalex.org/W2091616995,"The Arp2/3 complex creates filament branches leading to an enhancement in the rate of actin polymerization. Work with Arp complexes from different sources indicated that it was inactive by itself, required an activating factor such as the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), and might exhibit a preference for ATP or ADP-Pi actin. However, with yeast actin, Pi release is almost concurrent with polymerization, eliminating the presence of an ADP-Pi cap. We thus investigated the ability of the yeast Arp2/3 complex (yArp2/3) to facilitate yeast actin polymerization in the presence and absence of the Arp2/3-activating factor Las17p WA. yArp2/3 significantly accelerates yeast actin but not muscle actin polymerization in the absence of Las17p WA. The addition of Las17p WA further enhances yeast actin polymerization by yArp2/3 and allows the complex to now assist muscle actin polymerization. This actin isoform difference is not observed with bovine Arp2/3 complex, because the neural WASP VCA fragment is required for polymerization of both actins. Observation of individual branching filaments showed that Las17p WA increased the persistence of filament branches. Compared with wild type actin, the V159N mutant actin, proposed to be more ATP-like in behavior, exhibited an enhanced rate of polymerization in the presence of the yArp2/3 complex. yArp2/3 caused a significant rate of Pi release prior to observation of an increase in filament mass but while branched structures were present.

Here we describe SUMO modification of the Ets family member ERM at positions 89, 263, 293, and 350. To investigate how SUMO modification affects the function of ERM, Ets-responsive intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and E74 reporter plasmids were employed to demonstrate that SUMO modification causes inhibition of ERM-dependent transcription without affecting the subcellular localization, stability, or DNA-binding capacity of the protein. When the adenoviral protein Gam1 or the SUMO protease SENP1 was used to inhibit the SUMO modification pathway, ERM-dependent transcription was de-repressed.

To investigate how SUMO modification affects the function of ERM, Ets-responsive intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and E74 reporter plasmids were employed to demonstrate that SUMO modification causes inhibition of ERM-dependent transcription without affecting the subcellular localization, stability, or DNA-binding capacity of the protein. When the adenoviral protein Gam1 or the SUMO protease SENP1 was used to inhibit the SUMO modification pathway, ERM-dependent transcription was de-repressed. These results demonstrate that ERM is subject to SUMO modification and that this post-translational modification causes inhibition of transcription-enhancing activity. Covalent modification of proteins with ubiquitin-like proteins creates new proteins with unique protein surfaces that can mediate a range of protein-protein interactions (reviewed in Ref. 1Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Modification of proteins by the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) is increasingly recognized as an important regulatory mechanism that can affect the stability, subnuclear localization, and transcription-activating capacity of the protein (reviewed in Refs. 1Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar and 2Girdwood D.W. Tatham M.H. Hay R.T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Several transcription factors are reported to undergo SUMO modification, including the androgen receptor (3Poukka H. Karvonen U.

Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Three different types of enzyme constitute the SUMO pathway: ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; KR12345, K89R,K263R,K293R,K350R,K468R; EA12345, E89A,E263A,E293A, E350A,E468A; CPB, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme or carrier protein (E2), and ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3). Although Ubc9 is the only E2 (conjugating enzyme) found in humans, multiple E3 ligases have recently been identified. SUMO modification is a reversible process, and several SUMO proteases have been identified in mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In mammals, the ets genes encode a large family of transcription factors, characterized by their ETS DNA-binding domain. On the basis of conservation of this and other domains, these factors have been subclassified into 13 groups (for a review, see Ref. 11Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Some Ets transcription factors have been identified as targets of SUMO. For instance, Elk-1 is modified by SUMO, a modification that is reversed by signaling via the prototype extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK pathway, which induces a switch from the repressed to the transcriptionally active state (12Yang S.H. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 13Yang S.H. Jaffray E. Senthinathan B. Hay R.T. Sharrocks A.D. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SUMO modification of Elk-1 results in the recruitment of histone deacetylase activity to promoters; this indicates the existence of an important integration point for two protein-modifying pathways in the cell, the SUMO and deacetylation pathways, which combine to promote inhibition of transcription-enhancing activity (14Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). SUMO has also been shown to enhance the recruitment of the Ets transcription factor Tel into repressive domains such as the PML bodies (15Chakrabarti S.R. Nucifora G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 16Chakrabarti S.R. Sood R. Nandi S. Nucifora G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2003; 100: 3257-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The three PEA3 group members (PEA3/E1AF, ER81/ETV1, and ERM/ETV5) show high conservation of their ETS domain and of the two transcriptional activation domains (reviewed in Ref. 18de Launoit Y. Chotteau-Lelievre A. Beaudoin C. Coutte L. Netzer S. Brenner C. Huvent I. Baert J.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 480: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These factors are involved in a number of developmental processes. For example, they play a role in the organization of the germ layers showing high proliferation and migration rates (19Chotteau-Lelièvre A. Montesano R. Soriano J.V. Soulie P. Desbiens X. de Launoit Y. Dev. Biol. 2003; 259: 241-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and in the development of motor and sensory neurons (20Lin J.H. Saito T. Anderson D.J.

These factors have also been found to be deregulated in cancer and are over-expressed in metastatic human breast cancer cells (22Baert J.L. Monte D. Musgrove E.A. Albagli O. Sutherland R.L. de Launoit Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 590-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and Neu-induced mouse mammary tumors (23Trimble M.S. Xin J.H. Guy C.T. Muller W.J.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1739-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation regulate the function of the PEA3 group members. In particular, components of the MAPK pathway have been found to increase the transactivation capacity of these factors. This suggests that these factors may contribute to the nuclear response to cell stimulation and also to Ras-induced transformation (25Janknecht R. Monte D. Baert J.L. de Launoit Y.

The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathways are also involved in regulating the transcription-enhancing activity of the PEA3 group members (30Janknecht R.

We show that of the five putative SUMO modification sites of this protein, the first four can be conjugated to SUMO. We present the results of functional studies showing that this post-translational modification can inhibit ERM transcription-enhancing activity. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The yeast two-hybrid screening was performed with the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system as recommended by the manufacturer (Clontech). A DNA fragment encoding amino acids 72–370 of ERM was generated by PCR amplification and subcloned in-frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain contained in the yeast expression vector pLexA (Clontech) at the EcoRI restriction site. The resulting plasmid was transformed using a standard polyethylene glycol/LiAc-mediated transformation procedure into the EGY48 strain of yeast. An oligo(dT)-primed mammary gland cDNA library (Clontech) constructed in the yeast galactose-inducible expression plasmid pB42AD was introduced into the EGY48 yeast strain harboring the pLexA-ERM construct. The resulting co-transformants were grown at 30 °C in the absence of histidine, tryptophan, and uracil (selective minimal media). A total of 3 × 106 clones were screened for the capacity to grow on selective minimal media. Colonies growing in the absence of leucine and scoring positive for β-galactosidase activity by the filter assay method were directly recovered from the plate and grown in selective media lacking leucine. cDNA inserts from the positive yeast colonies were electrotransformed into KC8 Escherichia coli tryptophan auxotrophic bacterial cells. Transformants were grown on M9 (–Trp, –Amp) minimal medium to select for plasmids containing the pB42AD vector. The cDNA inserts were then sequenced by automated sequence analysis (ABI sequence analyzer). Plasmid Constructs—The full-length and amino-terminal truncated pSG5-ERM expression vectors and the pSV-HA-ERM vector have been described elsewhere (32Baert J.L. Beaudoin C. Coutte L. de Launoit Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1002-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The 5′ FLAG-tagged ERM vector (pSV-FLAG-ERM) was constructed using the ERM cDNA and the pSV plasmid used previously (33Laget M.P. Defossez P.A. Albagli O. Baert J.L. Dewitte F. Stehelin D. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1325-1336PubMed Google Scholar) (details are available upon request). The various ERM mutants (Lys to Arg and Glu to Ala) were generated with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. His6-SUMO-1, -SUMO-2, and -SUMO-3 expression plasmids have been described elsewhere (34Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). As luciferase reporter plasmids, we used the 3xE74-tk-Luc vector (25Janknecht R. Monte D. Baert J.L. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1745-1754PubMed Google Scholar) and the ICAMWT-Luc vector corresponding to the wild-type human ICAM-1 promoter fragment (bp –44 to –178) (Ets binding sites at positions –158 and –138) (35de Launoit Y. Audette M. Pelczar H. Plaza S. Baert J.L. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The pSG5-βGal vector was used to normalize transfections (32Baert J.L. Beaudoin C. Coutte L. de Launoit Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1002-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). SENP1 and SENP1mut expression vectors were kindly provided by Dr E. T. H. Yeh (University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston) (36Cheng J. Wang D. Wang Z. Yeh E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6021-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and the Gam1 and Gam1mut expression vectors were a gift from Dr S. Chiocca (European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy). Cell Culture and Transfections—Rabbit kidney (RK13), monkey kidney (COS-7), and human cervix (HeLa) carcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and cultured at 37 °C in water-saturated 5% CO2 atmosphere. 1.5 × 105 RK13 or HeLa cells/well were plated in 12-well plates, and the next day transient transfections were performed using the polyethyleneimine Exgen 500 procedure (Euromedex) using 150 ng of DNA/well including 25 ng of reporter plasmid, 10 ng of pSV expression vector, and 10 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector. When indicated, 20 ng of the plasmids expressing the wild-type or mutated SUMO-interfering molecule were used. Luciferase activity was determined 24 h after transfection and normalized with respect to the β-galactosidase activity (used as a measure of the transfection efficiency) as described previously (35de Launoit Y. Audette M. Pelczar H. Plaza S. Baert J.L. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The data presented are means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. To detect SUMO-modified forms of ERM, COS-7 or RK13 cells were transfected with 300 ng of ERM expression plasmid and, when indicated, with 700 ng of His6-tagged SUMO-1, -2, or -3 plasmids. After 24 h, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, or Ni2+ purification buffers. For the determination of protein half-life, COS-7 cells were transfected with ERM and SUMO-2 plasmids for 24 h and then treated with 80 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). After the indicated time, cells were processed for Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—Cells transfected with FLAG-tagged ERM were treated with 100 mm H2O2 for 20 min and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% SDS, 10 mm iodoacetamide, and protease inhibitors. After the addition of 9 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and 10 mm iodoacetamide, the cellular extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the immunopurified proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Prestained broad-range molecular weight markers (New England BioLabs) were used as standards in each SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblot analyzes were performed with the rabbit anti-ERM antibodies (22Baert J.L. Monte D. Musgrove E.A. Albagli O. Sutherland R.L. de Launoit Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 590-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or with the purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against SUMO-1 or SUMO-2/3 (Abgent) followed by treatment with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to manufacturer's instructions (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Identification of His-SUMO-ERM Conjugates—Transfected cells were lysed in denaturing buffer containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. His6-SUMO conjugates were purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography as described previously (37Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells plated in 6-well plates were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0)/35-mm well. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. Each sample was mixed with 20 μl of packed Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) and rotated 3 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer, three times with 8 m urea, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 6.4, and once with phosphate-buffered saline before being resuspended in Laemmli gel loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and His-SUMO-ERM conjugates were detected by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal anti-ERM antibody as described above. In Vitro SUMO Modification Reaction—[35S]Methionine-labeled substrates for SUMO modification reactions were generated by in vitro transcription/translation in wheat germ extract according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). In vitro modification was carried out with purified recombinant products as described (34Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Reaction products were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and detected by phosphorimaging. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—ERM was produced and sumoylated in vitro as described above. A portion of the reaction mixture was mixed with 1 ng of the 32P-labeled E74 probe (sense strand, 5′-GAGCTGAATAACCGGAAGTAACTCAT-3′) in the presence of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature and loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was run at 4 °C in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 180 V (32Baert J.L. Beaudoin C. Coutte L. de Launoit Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1002-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Studies—RK13 cells plated on coverslip slides were transfected with the different FLAG-tagged ERM plasmids. Twenty-four h later the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated for 2 h with 1:1000 diluted anti-FLAG antibody. This was followed by incubation for 1 h with 1:1000 diluted goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 antibody. SUMO Modification of ERM—To identify ERM-interacting proteins, we screened a human mammary gland cDNA library in the yeast two-hybrid system using a nontransactivating portion of the ERM molecule (amino acids 72–370) as bait. Twelve isolated clones were found to encode the human Ubc9. GST pull-down assays were used to obtain direct evidence for ERM binding to Ubc9 (data not shown), thus confirming Ubc9 as a novel ERM-interacting protein. Because Ubc9 is the only-known SUMO-conjugating enzyme (38Desterro J.M. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and because ERM displays five minimal consensus sumoylation motifs (ψKXE; ψ, large hydrophobic residue (39Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar)), we sought to determine whether ERM is a sumoylation target using in vitro and in vivo approaches. To show directly that ERM is a SUMO modification substrate, 35S-labeled ERM was generated by in vitro transcription/translation and incubated with purified components required for SUMO modification (34Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1A, analysis of the products indicates that a large proportion of the ERM was converted by SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3 to more slowly migrating forms in a reaction requiring the SUMO-activating enzyme E1 and the E2 enzyme Ubc9. To establish that ERM is modified by SUMO in vivo, we co-transfected RK13 cells with expression plasmids for ERM and His6-tagged SUMO-1, -2, or -3. Cells were lysed under conditions preserving SUMO modification, and ERM proteins were identified by Western blotting with an anti-ERM antibody. In the absence of SUMO, we observed a major 70-kDa protein species, corresponding to unmodified ERM. Higher molecular weight species were detected only when SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3 was present (Fig. 1B). Under these conditions, the presence of multiple high molecular weight species suggests that multiple SUMO modifications take place on ERM. Similar in vivo experiments were performed on other cell lines, such as COS-7. Again, the upper bands also appeared in the presence of each SUMO and were much pronounced in the presence of SUMO-2 (Fig. 1B). To prove that these upper bands corresponded to SUMO-modified forms of ERM, COS-7 cells transfected with ERM and His-SUMO-2 were lysed under highly denaturing conditions, and SUMO-modified proteins were isolated on nickel-agarose (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-bound proteins were then eluted and analyzed by Western blot with anti-ERM antibody. As expected, unmodified ERM was absent, and the higher molecular weight ERM species were observed in the SUMO-conjugated cellular fraction (Fig. 1C). It thus appears that ERM is modified by SUMO at multiple sites both in vitro and in vivo. SUMO Modification Sites on ERM—ERM contains five copies of the ψKXE sequence required for modification by SUMO (Fig. 2A). To locate sites of SUMO modification on the ERM protein, we generated amino-terminal deletion mutants of ERM and tested their ability to be SUMO-modified in vivo by co-transfection with His-SUMO-2 (as in Fig. 1C). Although wild-type ERM was modified by SUMO at multiple sites, ERM-(276–510) was modified at only one site and ERM-(354–510) did not appear to be SUMO-modified (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that residues Lys89 and Lys263 are likely targets of SUMO modification, along with either Lys263 or Lys350. It is unlikely that Lys468, although in a sequence matching perfectly the consensus sumoylation motif, is a site of SUMO modification. To determine precisely the sites of SUMO modification, we therefore replaced each potential acceptor lysine, separately or in combination, with an arginine unable to act as a SUMO acceptor. COS-7 cells were then co-transfected with a plasmid coding for wild-type or mutated ERM together with the SUMO-2 expression vector. ERM was revealed by Western blotting. Fig. 2B shows that the single mutation of Lys468 (KR5) has no significant effect on ERM SUMO modification. A single mutation of Lys89 (Fig. 2B, KR1), Lys 263 (KR2), or Lys 350 (KR4) reduced the intensity of at least some SUMO-modified ERM species, and a more pronounced effect was observed for the Lys293 mutation (KR3). When Lys263 and Lys293 (KR23) were mutated in combination, the more slowly migrating SUMO-conjugated species of ERM were no longer observed, but the major 110–120 kDa was still clearly detected. Further mutation of Lys350 (Fig. 2B, KR234) had little effect on the SUMO modification pattern, whereas mutation of Lys89 in combination with KR23 (KR123) caused the amount of the major SUMO-modified species to decrease markedly. This modified form was practically undetectable when Lys89, Lys263, Lys293, and Lys350 were mutated simultaneously (Fig. 2B, KR1234), and no further change was observed with ERM mutated at all five consensus sumoylation sites (KR12345). Simultaneous mutation at all of the five consensus sites completely prevented SUMO modification of ERM in vitro (Fig. 2C). These findings suggest that SUMO modification occurs only at consensus sites and that, of the five consensus sites identified in ERM, the motif containing Lys468 in the carboxyl-terminal part of ERM is the only one that is not SUMO-modified in vivo. ERM Is SUMO-modified in Response to Stress in Vivo— Because cell stresses such as heat shock or oxidative stress induce SUMO conjugation (40Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), we investigated the ability of endogenous SUMO to modify ERM in vivo upon exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). For this purpose, COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids coding for wild-type or KR12345 FLAG-ERM, and transfected cells were treated or not with H2O2. The cell extracts were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot with antibodies against ERM or SUMO. With the anti-ERM antibody, unmodified ERM was detected independently on H2O2 treatment. In contrast, more slowly migrating ERM species were observed specifically in the H2O2-treated cells. These H2O2-induced more slowly migrating ERM species were not observed with the FLAG-ERM KR12345 mutant (Fig. 3); their appearance was thus dependent on the presence of the sumoylation sites. To determine which form of SUMO was conjugated to ERM, extracts from H2O2-treated cells immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody were analyzed by Western blotting using either an anti-SUMO-1 or an anti-SUMO-2/3 antibody. The more slowly migrating forms of ERM were detected with the anti-SUMO-2/3 antibody but not with the anti-SUMO-1 antibody. These forms were absent when ERM KR12345 was used. This indicates that endogenous SUMO-2 or/and -3 are responsible for H2O2-induced ERM sumoylation in vivo. SUMO Sites in ERM Correlate with Inhibition of Transcription-enhancing Activity—To investigate the effect of SUMO modification on ERM transcription-enhancing activity, we analyzed the ability of wild-type and mutant forms of the protein to activate ERM-dependent reporter genes. In experiments with the human Ets-responsive ICAM-1 minimal promoter (35de Launoit Y. Audette M. Pelczar H. Plaza S. Baert J.L. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the wild-type ERM caused an ∼20-fold increase in transactivation (Fig. 4A, WT). ERM singly mutated at any one of the five consensus sumoylation sites showed the same or nearly the same transactivation power as wild-type ERM (Fig. 4A, left panel). Triply mutated ERM proteins KR123 and KR234, however, showed an ∼3-fold higher transactivation capacity. No further increase was observed with the KR1234 and KR12345 ERM mutants (Fig. 4A). The second luciferase reporter vector used contains three E74 Ets-binding sites cloned upstream from the minimal thymidine kinase promoter. Although ERM specifically interacts with the E74 binding site, it cannot activate the E74 reporter construct without stimulation by post-translational modification such as phosphorylation (32Baert J.L. Beaudoin C. Coutte L. de Launoit Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1002-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A (right panel), RK13 cells co-transfected with the E74 reporter and a plasmid expressing either the wild-type or a singly mutated ERM showed similar, near basal level luciferase activity. When a multiply mutated ERM was used, transactivation increased about 4-fold (KR234) to 8-fold (KR123, KR1234 and KR12345) (Fig. 4A). As assessed by immunofluorescence, the sumoylable (Fig. 4B, WT) and the nonsumoylable (KR12345) ERM forms similarly localized in the nucleus in a diffuse manner. Localization of ERM was not affected by overexpression of SUMO-2. Altogether, these results clearly show that the nonsumoylable ERM mutant has an enhanced transcriptional capacity and that it is not due to change in intracellular localization. We then investigated whether change in the transcriptional activity of the sumoylation defective ERM mutant is due to variation of protein stability as previously reported for other proteins (41Desterro J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2024147161,"p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) acts as an 'adaptor/mediator' for transducing DNA damage signals, especially following detection of DNA double-strand breaks. In an effort to broaden our understanding of the protein network surrounding 53BP1, we isolated possible 53BP1 binding partners by co-immunoprecipitation, and identified them via tandem mass spectrometric analysis. The 53BP1-associated proteins included RPA1 and RPA2, two components of the replication protein A (RPA) complex. The presence of RPA components in the immunoprecipitates was confirmed by immunoblotting, and we found that the association between 53BP1 and RPA2 was disrupted following DNA damage induced by treatment with camptothecin, a topoisomerase I inhibitor. To investigate the functional meaning of the 53BP1 and RPA interaction, we established U2OS osteosarcoma cell lines stably expressing dominant-negative fragments of 53BP1. We found that camptothecin-induced RPA2 phosphorylation was inhibited in these cells, and also following 53BP1 knockdown by siRNA transfection. On the cellular level, camptothecin-induced apoptosis was augmented in the dominant-negative cell lines, resulting in increased chemosensitivity to this drug. Taken together, these results suggest that 53BP1 is involved in DNA damage-induced RPA2 hyperphosphorylation, and inhibition of 53BP1 function may sensitize cancer cells to camptothecin treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2013762121,"The aim of this study was to investigate the level and the prognostic value of the expression of different survivin transcript variants--survivin, survivin-DeltaEx3 and survivin-2B--in tumours of 76 soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients. The expression of survivin transcript variants in STS tissue samples and in 12 nonmalignant control tissues was analysed by quantitative RT-PCRs. Expression levels of all survivin transcript variants were strongly elevated in STS compared to normal tissues. A positive correlation between expression of splice variants and tumour stage was found (P=0.02; chi2 test). The multivariate Cox's proportional hazards regression model revealed a 7.3-fold increased risk of tumour-related death for patients with survivin-DeltaEx3 overexpressing tumours (P=0.007). The effect of surivivin (wildtype variant) and survivin-2B was less pronounced but still significant (2.2- and 1.9-fold, resp., P<0.05 each). Our results show for the first time that mRNA expression of survivin-variants is significantly correlated to a poor prognosis for STS patients, and we suggest expression of survivin splice variants together with tumour stage as independent predictor of survival."
https://openalex.org/W1489650879,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a major G protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-activating ligand present in serum, elicits growth factor like responses by stimulating specific GPCRs coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins such as Gi, Gq, and G12/13. Previous studies have shown that the overexpression of wild-type Gα12 (Gα12WT) results in the oncogenic transformation of NIH3T3 cells (Gα12WT-NIH3T3) in a serum-dependent manner. Based on the potent growth-stimulating activity of LPA and the presence of LPA and LPA-like molecules in the serum, we hypothesized that the serum-dependent neoplastic transformation of Gα12WT-NIH3T3 cells was mediated by the stimulation of LPA-receptors (LPARs) by LPA in the serum. In the present study, using guanine nucleotide exchange assay and GST-TPR binding assay, we show that the treatment of Gα12WT-NIH3T3 with 2 μ M LPA leads to the activation of Gα12. Stimulation of these cells with LPA promotes JNK-activation, a critical component of Gα12-response and cell proliferation. We also show that LPA can substitute for serum in stimulating JNK-activity, DNA synthesis, and proliferation of Gα12WT-NIH3T3 cells. LPA-mediated proliferative response in NIH3T3 cells involves Gα12, but not the closely related Gα13. Pretreatment of Gα12WT-NIH3T3 cells with suramin (100 μ M), a receptor-uncoupling agent, inhibited LPA-stimulated proliferation of these cells by 55% demonstrating the signal coupling between cell surface LPAR and Gα12 in the neoplastic proliferation of NIH3T3 cells. As LPA and LPAR mediated mitogenic pathways have been shown to play a major role in tumor genesis and progression, a mechanistic understanding of the signal coupling between LPAR, Gα12, and the downstream effectors is likely to unravel additional targets for novel cancer chemotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W2126162016,"Despite the fact that objective response rates to 5-FU are as low as 20%, 5-FU remains the most commonly used drug for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The lack of understanding of resistance to 5-FU, therefore, remains a significant impediment in maximizing its efficacy. We used intestinal epithelial cells with an inducible K-RasV12 to demonstrate that expression of oncogenic Ras promotes cell death upon 5-FU treatment. Accordingly, transient expression of the mutant RasV12, but not the WT Ras, enhanced 5-FU-induced apoptosis in 293T cells. Consistent with these data, we showed that targeted deletion of the mutant Ras allele in the HCT116 colon cancer cell line protected cells from 5-FU-induced apoptosis. Using isogenic colon cancer cell lines that differ only by the presence of the mutant Ras allele, HCT116 and Hke-3 cells, we demonstrated that signaling by oncogenic Ras promotes both accumulation of p53 and its phosphorylation on serine15 in response to 5-FU, a situation that favors apoptosis over growth arrest. However, despite the differential induction of p53 in HCT116 and Hke-3 cells, the expression of Puma, a gene with an important role in p53-dependent apoptosis, was not affected by Ras signaling. In contrast, we showed that Ras interferes with 5-FU-induced expression of gelsolin, a protein with known antiapoptotic activity. We ascertained the role of gelsolin in 5-FU-induced apoptosis by demonstrating that silencing of gelsolin expression through RNAi sensitized cells to 5-FU-induced apoptosis and that re-expression of gelsolin in cells harboring mutant Ras protected cells from 5-FU-induced apoptosis. These data therefore demonstrate that Ras mutations increase sensitivity to 5-FU-induced apoptosis at least in part through the negative regulation of gelsolin expression. Our data indicate that Ras mutations promote apoptosis in response to 5-FU treatment and imply that tumors with Ras mutations and/or reduced expression of gelsolin may show enhanced apoptosis in response to 5-FU also in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2142127935,"The Raf/MEK/ERK (extracellular regulated kinase) signal transduction pathway controls the ability of cells to respond to proliferative, apoptotic, migratory and differentiation signals. We have investigated the combined contribution of A-Raf and Raf-1 isotypes to signalling through this pathway by generating mice with knockout mutations of both A-raf and raf-1 genes. Double knockout (DKO) mice have a more severe phenotype than single null mutations of either gene, dying in embryogenesis at E10.5. The DKO embryos show no changes in apoptosis, but staining for Ki67 indicates a generalized reduction in proliferation. DKO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit a delayed ability to enter S phase of the cell cycle. This is associated with a reduction in levels of transiently induced MEK and ERK phosphorylation and reduced expression of c-Fos and cyclin Dl. Levels of sustained ERK phosphorylation are not significantly altered. Thus, Raf-1 and A-Raf have a combined role in controlling physiological transient ERK activation and in maintenance of cell cycle progression at its usual rate."
https://openalex.org/W2010690351,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is a potent inhibitor of renin gene expression in renal juxtaglomerular cells.

Arterial blood pressure is one of the most important components of cardiovascular homeostasis in mammals. The plasma renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays a fundamental role in the regulation of blood pressure (1Hackenthal E. Paul M. Ganten D. Taugner R. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1067-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Renin is the key enzyme controlling the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

The JG cells are a small cell population in the afferent arteriole wall, located in the adjacent vicinity of the glomerulus (2Taugner R. Bührle C.P. Hackenthal E. Mannek E. Nobiling R. Contrib. Nephrol. 1984; 43: 76-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Renin production is regulated by a variety of factors (3Wagner C. Jensen B.L. Krämer B.K. Kurtz A. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 78-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Wagner C. Kurtz A. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1998; 7: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have reported that the cytokine TNFα is a potent inhibitor of renin synthesis at the cellular level (5Todorov V. Müller M. Schweda F. Kurtz A. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2002; 283: 1046-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This effect is likely to be part of a physiologically relevant feedback loop since increased blood pressure per se is a stimulus for the production of TNFα (6Dorffel Y. Latsch C. Stuhlmüller B. Schreiber S. Scholze S. Burmester G.R. Scholze J. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 7Kapadia S.R. Ora l H. Lee J. Nakano M. Taffet G.E. Mann D.L. Circ.

Benjafield A.V. Morris B.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1943-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and TNFα signaling seems to be defective in a rat model of hypertension (9Johns D.G. Webb R.C. Charpie J.R. J. Hypertens. 2001; 19: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in studying the intracellular mode of action of TNFα on renin gene expression. Recently, we found that TNFα suppresses renin transcription by a unique cell-specific mechanism (10Todorov V.T. Volkl S. Muller M. Bohla A. Klar J. Kunz-Schughart L.A. Hehlgans T. Kurtz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1458-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We established a direct interaction between transcription factor NFκB and a CRE in the proximal renin promoter, which seemed to be decisive for the inhibition of renin gene expression by TNFα. However, CRE is the canonical cis-acting element for CREB/ATF transcription factors (11Ziff E.B. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 69-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 12Lalli E.

Although TNFα appeared to target exclusively NFκB to suppress renin gene expression, CREB/ATF proteins may also play a significant role in the mechanism of TNFα action. CREB1, which is the prototypical CREB/ATF transcription factor, was found to bind to mouse renin CRE (14Pan L. Black T.A. Shi Q. Jones C.A. Petrovic N. Loudon J. Kane C. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J.

From these data it could be hypothesized that CREB1 might be involved in the down-regulation of renin gene expression by TNFα.NFκB-p65 was also found to bind to mouse renin CRE (10Todorov V.T.

Unless otherwise specified, TNFα (Calbiochem, 10 ng/ml) was applied for 20 h. RNA Interference—Ready-to-use double-stranded 21-nucleotide siRNAs were synthesized by IBA (Germany). The siRNA targeting CREB1 (GenBank™ accession number M95106) corresponded to positions 85–105 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon. Single-stranded sense RNAs (used as control) or siRNAs (200 nm) were transfected into As4.1 cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h firefly luciferase vector (Luc1) and Renilla luciferase vector (Luc2) were transfected into As4.1 cells according to the same protocol. Cells were harvested 72 h after the first transfection.

For preparation of nuclear extracts containing the Gal4:p65 fusion protein, 3 × 106 As4.1 cells were split in a 75-cm2 flask. Four micrograms of the Gal4:p65 construct were transfected on the next day. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were split into two 25-cm2 flasks. After overnight incubation, TNFα was applied (10 ng/ml for 20 h), or cells were left untreated (control). This protocol was performed to avoid differences in the transfection efficiency in the absence of an internal control. Luciferase Assay—Luciferase activity was measured with the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative luciferase activity was calculated as firefly luciferase to renilla luciferase ratio (Luc1/Luc2). Statistics—Experiments were carried out in triplicate with three samples per condition unless otherwise indicated. Representative EMSAs or Western blots were shown. Levels of significance were estimated by analysis of variance followed by Student's unpaired t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. CREB1 Is Involved in the Regulation of Basal Renin Transcription—CREB/ATF transcription factors are known to be involved in the regulation of renin transcription. However, the function of the different members of the family in the control of renin gene is not exactly known. Mouse renin CRE was found to bind almost exclusively CREB1 (14Pan L. Black T.A. Shi Q.

Therefore, we tried to characterize the precise role of CREB1 in the regulation of renin gene expression in the mouse JG cell line As4.1. To this end we knocked-down CREB1 gene expression by RNA interference. CREB1 was effectively down-regulated by sequence-specific siRNA (Fig. 1A). The changes in CREB1 abundance in siRNA-treated versus control cells were paralleled by decreased renin mRNA as well as by decreased activity of renin gene promoter (Fig. 1, B and C). Moreover, there was a straight correlation between renin and CREB1 mRNA abundance (Fig. 1D). These findings show that CREB1 is capable of regulating the basal transcriptional activity of renin gene. Therefore, we studied the potential role of CREB1 in the TNFα-mediated suppression of renin gene expression. CREB1 is known to bind to DNA in a constitutive manner (24Karin M. Smeal T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 418-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Its trans-activation is regulated by phosphorylation on serine 133, located in the kinase-inducible domain of the CREB1 molecule (25Gonzales G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). Treatment with TNFα induced transitory phosphorylation of CREB1 during the first hour of incubation (Fig. 2). This was a surprising finding because CREB1 phosphorylation stimulates, whereas TNFα inhibits renin transcription (10Todorov V.T. Volkl S. Muller M. Bohla A. Klar J. Kunz-Schughart L.A. Hehlgans T.

This apparent discrepancy could be explained with the transient nature of CREB1 phosphorylation, which peaks during the first 5 min of treatment with TNFα (Fig. 2). Because the renin mRNA half-life in As4.1 cells is about 8 h (15Klar J. Sandner P. Müller M.W. Kurtz A. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based DNA binding assay, which is presently the most sensitive method of studying DNA-protein interactions (26Shen Z. Peedikayil J. Olson G.K. Siebert P.D. Fang Y. Biotechniques. 2002; 32 (1170–1172, 1174): 1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). There was a small decrease (about 25%) in the binding of CREB1 to a CRE sequence in TNFα-treated cells (Fig. 3). This partially diminished binding of CREB1 to mouse renin CRE could contribute to a certain extent to the inhibition of renin gene expression by TNFα. However, the total amount of the protein complex bound to mouse renin CRE seemed not to be reduced after TNFα treatment (10Todorov V.T. Volkl S. Muller M. Bohla A. Klar J. Kunz-Schughart L.A. Hehlgans T. Kurtz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1458-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that CREB1 is partially replaced by another protein(s). NFκB was found to bind to mouse renin CRE (10Todorov V.T. Volkl S. Muller M. Bohla A. Klar J. Kunz-Schughart L.A. Hehlgans T. Kurtz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1458-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The consensus NFκB binding sequence (GGGACTTTCC) is not related to CRE (TGACGTCA). It is, therefore, unclear how NFκB could interact with CRE. To address this problem we studied the DNA binding properties of in vitro translated NFκB-p65, which is assumed to confer the trans-activation properties of NFκB (16Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 17Urban M.B. Baeuerle P.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1575-1584Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar) in shift assays. Both in vitro translated CREB1 and p65 bound to their corresponding consensus DNA motif (CRE or NFκB binding site, respectively), confirming the efficiency of the method (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 10). There was additional CRE binding activity in the lysate used for the in vitro translation (marked with NR (not related)), which could be clearly distinguished from the CREB1-dependent shift of the CRE probe (Fig. 4, lanes 2–6). Neither CREB1 nor p65 could bind to an unrelated sequence (NFκB binding site or CRE, respectively) (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 11). Similarly to the consensus CRE sequence, renCRE was found to bind CREB1 but not p65 (Fig. 5A, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, p65 seems to interact with CRE indirectly. Data suggests that p65 is capable of forming heterodimers with basic-domain-leucine-zipper (bZip) transcription factors (27Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 28Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Angel P. Herrlich P.

Thus, CREB1 could mediate the binding of p65 to mouse renin CRE. To test the hypothesis that p65 may heterodimerize with CREB1, we added increasing amounts of p65 to CREB1 in shift assays with renCRE probe. (Fig. 5B). The total amount of in vitro translated protein in each sample was kept constant with firefly luciferase. The addition of p65 to CREB1 appeared not to increase the amount of protein bound to renCRE (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, the binding of CREB1 to CRE also seemed not to be affected upon the addition of p65 (data not shown). These results provide evidence against possible dimerization of CREB1 and p65.Fig. 5Mechanism of interaction of p65 with renCRE. A, in vitro translated CREB1 (lanes 2–4) or p65 (lane 5) were probed with renCRE in EMSA. The sample in lane 1 contained just the labeled probe.

Nonradioactive (cold) renCRE was added to the sample in lane 3 for competition analysis. S, shifted DNA-protein complex; NR, not related binding activity of the in vitro translation lysate; FP, free probe. B, in vitro translated CREB1 (3 μl) was probed with renCRE in EMSA. In vitro translated p65 was added to the samples in lanes 2 (2 μl) and 3 (4 μl). In vitro translated firefly luciferase was added to keep the amount of total in vitro translated lysate in each sample unchanged.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NFκB-p65 Plays a Major Role in the Down-regulation of Renin Transcription by TNFα—The strong effect of TNFα on renin transcription could not be explained just by the marginal changes in the binding of CREB1 and p65. Because TNFα influenced just transiently the trans-activation potential of CREB1, we tested whether it has an effect on the transactivation potential of p65. In contrast to CREB1, NFκB is known to regulate transcription basically by signal-dependent-inducible DNA binding (31Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5513) Google Scholar). Therefore, to assess the transcriptional activity of p65 independently of its binding activity, we used a fusion protein-reporter gene system (21Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The fusion protein consists of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 DNA binding domain linked to the full-length p65. When co-transfected with a reporter gene driven by a minimal Gal4 binding sequence, the fusion protein should bind to this sequence in a constitutive manner through its Gal4 domain. Thus, changes in the expression of the reporter gene would reflect solely the trans-activation status of p65 but not its binding capacity. Using firefly luciferase as a reporter, we found that TNFα inhibits the transcriptional activity of p65 by 70% in As4.1 cells (Fig. 6A). We tested whether TNFα has an impact on the DNA binding activity of the Gal4 fusion protein, since this may also provide an explanation for the alterations in the expression of Gal4-dependent reporter gene. The binding of Gal4:p65 fusion protein remained unchanged after treatment with TNFα, indicating that the down-regulation Gal4-driven reporter gene expression by TNFα was due principally to impaired transactivation potential of p65 (Fig. 6B). The activity of a Gal4:cRel fusion protein was also inhibited by TNFα (Fig. 6C), demonstrating that the effect of TNFα is not restricted to a single Rel protein of the NFκB family. However, cRel appeared to possess less than 10% of the basal transactivation potential of p65 (Fig. 6C), suggesting that it plays a minor role in mediating the effect of TNFα in As4.1 cells. To test if the inhibition of p65 transcriptional activity by TNFα may directly suppress renin transcription, we replaced"
https://openalex.org/W1992845765,"Homologous recombination can induce tumorigenic sequence rearrangements. Here, we show that persistent hyper-recombination can be induced following exposure to a bifunctional alkylating agent, mitomycin C (MMC), and that the progeny of exposed cells induce a hyper-recombination phenotype in unexposed neighboring cells. Residual damage cannot be the cause of delayed recombination events, since recombination is observed after drug and template damage are diluted over a million-fold. Furthermore, not only do progeny of MMC-exposed cells induce recombination in unexposed cells (bystanders), but these bystanders can in turn induce recombination in their unexposed neighbors. Thus, a signal to induce homologous recombination can be passed from cell to cell. Although the underlying molecular mechanism is not yet known, these studies reveal that cells suffer consequences of damage long after exposure, and that can signal unexposed neighboring cells to respond similarly. Thus, a single acute exposure to a chemotherapeutic agent can cause long-term changes in genomic stability. If the results of these studies of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are generally applicable to many cell types, these results suggest that a relatively small number of cells could potentially induce a tissue-wide increase in the risk of de novo homologous recombination events."
https://openalex.org/W1967944738,"Rap1 is a Ras-related GTPase that is principally involved in integrin- and E-cadherin-mediated adhesion. Rap1 is transiently activated in response to many incoming signals via a large family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). The lack of potent Rap1 dominant-negative mutants has limited our ability to decipher Rap1-dependent pathways; we have therefore developed a procedure to generate such mutants consisting in the oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis of residues 14-19, selection of mutants presenting an enhanced interaction with Epac2 by yeast two-hybrid screening and counter-screening for mutants still interacting with Rap effectors. In detail analysis of their interaction capacity with various Rap-GEFs in the yeast two-hybrid system revealed that mutants of residues 15 and 16 interacted with Epacs, C3G and CalDAG-GEFI, whereas mutants of position 17 had selectively lost their ability to bind CalDAG-GEFI as well as, for some, C3G. In cellular models where Rap1 is activated via endogenous GEFs, the Rap1[S17A] mutant inhibits both the cAMP-Epac and EGF-C3G pathways, whereas Rap1[G15D] selectively interferes with the latter. Finally, Rap1[S17A] is able to act as a bona fide dominant-negative mutant in vivo since it phenocopies the eye-reducing and lethal effects of D-Rap1 deficiency in Drosophila, effects that are overcome by the overexpression of D-Epac or D-Rap1."

Helicases are enzymes that utilize the free energy derived from the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates to unwind duplex RNA or DNA. All of the organisms contain several helicases involved in the processes of nucleic acid metabolism, such as replication, transcription, translation, recombination, and so forth (1Tuteja N. Tuteja R.

Pif1p is conserved among eukaryotes, as homologues have been described in other yeasts, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and human (9Bessler J.B. Torredagger J.Z. Zakian V.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 60-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Pif1p is a 5′-3′-directional distributive DNA helicase that is functional in the monomeric state and is preferentially recruited to forklike DNA structures (10Lahaye A. Leterme S. Foury F. J. Biol.

The second DNA helicase described in yeast mitochondria, Hmi1p, is a close homologue of the bacterial Rep, UvrD, and PcrA helicases (5Sedman T. Kuusk S. Kivi S. Sedman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1816-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To date, in silico analyses of eukaryotes reveal Hmi1p homologues only in evolutionarily close yeasts from the family of Saccharomycetaceae. The C terminus of Hmi1p contains a mitochondrial targeting signal peptide that is cleaved off after the protein is transported into mitochondria (14Lee C.M. Sedman J. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20937-20942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Deletion of Hmi1p has a more severe effect on mtDNA metabolism than the deletion of Pif1p, because Hmi1p-deficient mutants do not retain functional mtDNA (5Sedman T. Kuusk S. Kivi S. Sedman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1816-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have shown that Hmi1p also influences the rho mtDNA metabolism, because in the absence of Hmi1p, the rho mtDNA concatemers are shorter (15Sedman T. Jõers P. Kuusk S. Sedman J. Curr. Genet. 2005; 47: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This shortening of the rho mtDNA molecules is linked to transcription, because the absence of Hmi1p has a much less effect on the mitochondrial RNA polymerase Rpo41p-deficient mutant. In addition, the role of Hmi1p on the functional mtDNA has been studied using a temperature-sensitive mutant of Hmi1p. We demonstrated that the cells containing the temperature-sensitive mutant of Hmi1p lost mtDNA through fragmentation during growth under restrictive temperatures, this being similar to the effect of Hmi1p on rho mtDNA metabolism (15Sedman T. Jõers P. Kuusk S. Sedman J. Curr. Genet. 2005; 47: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In mammalian mitochondria, another DNA helicase, Twinkle, has been described, which has no homologue in S. cerevisiae (16Moraes C.T. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 200-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The Twinkle helicase has sequence similarity to the bacteriophage T7 gene 4 protein and other hexameric helicases/primases (17Spelbrink J.N. Li F.Y. Tiranti V. Nikali K. Yuan Q.P. Tariq M.

Genet. 2001; 28: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). It is a 5′-3′-directional helicase that has been proposed to be the replicative helicase of mammalian mitochondria, as it has been shown to form a minimal mtDNA replisome in vitro together with the mitochondrial DNA polymerase and the mitochondrial ssDNA-binding protein (18Korhonen J.A. Gaspari M. Falkenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48627-48632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 19Korhonen J.A. Pham X.H. Pellegrini M. Falkenberg M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2423-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that two DNA helicases have been described in S. cerevisiae mitochondria, the question of replicative helicases in mitochondria is still unsolved. For Pif1p, a role in mtDNA metabolism has been proposed. The function of Hmi1p in this context has remained ambiguous. We have ruled out the involvement of Hmi1p in mtDNA transcription (5Sedman T. Kuusk S. Kivi S. Sedman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1816-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whether Hmi1p is involved in mtDNA replication is not clear, but it cannot be the sole replicative helicase because, in the Hmi1p-deficient strain, the rho mtDNA is still maintained. To further elucidate the role of Hmi1p in mitochondria, we have purified the recombinant Hmi1p from Escherichia coli. Here we describe the helicase activity of Hmi1p, its processivity, nucleotide cofactor utilization, and DNA substrate requirements. Constructs Used for Protein Overexpression—The previously described plasmid pGEX41-HMI1 was used for the overexpression of Hmi1p (5Sedman T. Kuusk S. Kivi S. Sedman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1816-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To change the conserved Glu-211 to Gln, the G nucleotide in the position 631 of the HMI1 open reading frame was changed to C by cloning the HMI1 open reading frame into pUC119 phagemid vector followed by site-directed mutagenesis conducted by the method of Kunkel et al. (20Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). To generate the plasmid pGEX41-HMI1(E211Q) that was used for the overexpression of the mutant Hmi1p(E211Q), the mutated HMI1 open reading frame was cloned into the BamHI site of the pGEX4T1 vector. Here and elsewhere, the restriction enzymes as well as other DNA-modifying enzymes were from Fermentas. Both the WT and the mutant Hmi1p(E211Q) expression constructs were verified by sequencing. Expression and Purification of Hmi1p and Hmi1p(E211Q)—Hmi1p and Hmi1p(E211Q) were purified essentially as described previously (5Sedman T. Kuusk S. Kivi S. Sedman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1816-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Kuusk S. Sedman T. Sedman J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 197: 303-316PubMed Google Scholar). A 2–3-liter culture of E. coli strain DH5α harboring either pGEX41-HMI1 or pGEX41-HMI1(E211Q) was grown in 2× YT broth (16 g/liter tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C until an A600 of 0.4 was reached. The culture was cooled to 25 °C, and the expression of Hmi1p was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to the final concentration of 1 mm and incubation for 10–15 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. The cell suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –75 °C. Subsequent purification was performed at 0–4 °C. The cells were thawed and lysed for 1.5 h with 1 mg/ml lysozyme followed by one freezing-thawing cycle. After thawing, buffer A was added to 50 ml and the cells were sonicated (5 × 20-s pulses separated by 1-min intervals at 70% power, Ultrasonic homogenizer CP300, Cole-Parmer Instrument Co.). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 12,000 × g. 30 mg of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma catalogue number G4510) preequilibrated in buffer A were added to the extract and incubated for 3–6 h with gentle mixing. The beads were poured into a 5-ml plastic column and washed consecutively with 10 ml of buffer B (20% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT), 2 ml of buffer B with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 ml of buffer B, 2 ml of buffer B adjusted to 1 m NaCl, and again with 2 ml of buffer B. The protein was eluted with buffer B containing 10 mm glutathione. The fractions containing Hmi1p (2–4 mg of total protein) were pooled together and adjusted to 2.6 mm CaCl2, and the GST tag was cleaved with 40 units of thrombin (Sigma catalogue number T6634) by incubating overnight on ice. The protein concentration was determined here and elsewhere by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. The sample was diluted 3-fold with buffer B without NaCl and loaded onto a 1-ml Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer B containing 100 mm NaCl. Hmi1p was found to be in the Q-Sepharose flow-through that was further loaded onto a 0.3-ml S-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer C (25 mm Mes-NaOH, pH 6.5, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 100 mm NaCl. The column was washed with buffer C containing 150 mm NaCl, and Hmi1p was eluted with buffer C containing 400 mm NaCl. Aliquots of the peak fraction were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –75 °C. The protein concentration in the peak fractions was estimated to ∼0.1–0.4 mg/ml. The molarities of Hmi1p were calculated from the estimated protein concentrations and the approximate molecular mass of Hmi1p without the 15 C-terminal amino acids (78.5 kDa). Sedimentation in Glycerol Gradient—A 200-μl aliquot of Hmi1p (80 μg) was loaded on a 5-ml 10–30% glycerol gradient containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged in a Sorwall SW 55 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 13 h at 4 °C. 26 fractions of 200 μl were collected from the top of the tube. The protein concentration in the fractions was determined, and aliquots of the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions were also analyzed for the ATPase activity using the charcoal assay as described below. BSA, ovalbumin, aldolase, and catalase were run in parallel gradients as molecular mass markers. ATPase Assays—The ATPase activity in the glycerol gradient fractions was measured discontinuously using an assay monitoring the release of radioactively labeled phosphorus from [γ-32P]ATP (21Kuusk S. Sedman T. Sedman J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 197: 303-316PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture (10 μl) contained 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.1 μm oligonucleotide F as ssDNA cofactor (see Table I), 1-μl aliquot from the glycerol gradient fractions, and ∼50,000 cpm of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and stopped by extracting twice with 150 μl of stop solution (0.035% HCl, 2 mm KH2PO4, 1.25% NoritA). The released phosphate was measured using a WinSpectral 1414 Liquid Scintillation Counter (Wallac).Table IOligonucleotidesOligonucleotideStrandLengthSequence (5′→3′)ntBBottom45GGGCAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGTAGACCTGCGGTTGGATCB9Bottom31CGACTCACTATAGTAGACCTGCGGTTGGATCB5Bottom27TCACTATAGTAGACCTGCGGTTGGATCB2Bottom24CTATAGTAGACCTGCGGTTGGATCBDBottom79TCGGTTGACGTTCCAGTGTGACCGCAATACGAGTAAGGCCTGAGCACGCCGACGAACATTCACCACGCCAGACCACGTAT3O22Top20AGTGAGTCGTATTACAATTGT3O19Top23TATAGTGAGTCGTATTACAATTGT3O16Top20TACTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAT3O13Top23GTCTACTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAT3O9Top20GCAGGTCTACTATACTCACTT3O5Top23AACCGCAGGTGTACTATAGTGAGT3T16Top38GATCCAACCGCAGGTCTACTATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT3T9Top31GATCCAACCGCAGGTCTACTATTTTTTTTTTT3T5Top27GATCCAACCGCAGGTCTACTATTTTTTT3T2Top24GATCCAACCGCAGGTCTACTATTTT5O22Top18GATCCAACCGCAGGTCTAT5T9Top31TTTTTTTTTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACAATTGUSPTop17GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTCTop70CGACGGCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACCTGCAGGCATGCAAGCTTGGTDTop79TACGTGGTCTCCGCTGGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCACACTGGAACGTCAACCGATINVTop42TGAATGTTCGTCGGCGTGCTCAGGCCTTACTCGTATTGCGGTTINV3TTop61TGAATGTTCGTCGGCGTGCTCAGGCCTTACTCGTATTGCGGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTINV5TTop61TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGAATGTTCGTCGGCGTGCTCAGGCCTTAGTGCTATTGCGGTF29CCGAATTCATGCCCGGAACGCCACAGAAGG87TAATTATTTATATTCTATATGGGGTCCCAATTATTATTTTCAATAATAATTATTATTGGGACCCGGATATCTTCTTGTTTATCATTT Open table in a new tab To determine the kinetic parameters for ATP hydrolysis, the ATPase activity was assayed by linking the ADP formation to the oxidation of NADH as described previously (23Runyon G.T. Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The assay mixture (0.5 ml) contained 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.3 μm oligonucleotide G as ssDNA cofactor (see Table I), 40 units/ml pyruvate kinase (from rabbit muscle, Roche Applied Science), 40 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase (Calbiochem), 4 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, and 0.3 mm NADH. Six independent reactions were carried out at each of four different ATP concentrations used (1, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 mm). Samples were prewarmed for 3 min at 30 °C, and the reaction was initiated by adding Hmi1p to the final concentration of 0.03 μm. The hydrolysis of ATP was monitored by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601PC). Values for the constants Vmax and Km were derived by nonlinear regression analysis according to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Preparation of Substrates for Helicase Assays—The DNA sequences of all of the oligonucleotides used for preparing substrates are shown in Table I. Oligonucleotides annealed to give various substrates are listed in Table II. The annealing reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 0.5–1 μm oligonucleotides and buffer Y (33 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 66 mm potassium acetate) was incubated for 5 min at 80 °C, slow-cooled to 25 °C over a period of 2–3 h, and then incubated on ice for 15 min. The top strand oligonucleotides (for making substrates 2–6, 16–21, and 23–27) and the bottom strand oligonucleotides (for making substrates 7–10) were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase before annealing to the complementary strand oligonucleotides. The top strand oligonucleotides of the substrates 1, 11–15, 22, and 28 were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using the DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment in the presence of 0.1 mm dNTPs as indicated in Table II. The substrates were purified by electrophoresis in 8% polyacrylamide gels (29:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) using 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA as electrophoresis buffer. The substrates were eluted from the gel by incubating the gel slices overnight at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. For preparing substrate 29, the oligonucleotide USP was 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed to phagemid pUC119 ssDNA as described above. To get a substrate with heterogeneous length of duplex DNA, a DNA synthesis reaction was performed in the presence of 0.5 mm dNTPs and 0.1 mm ddGTP using T7 DNA polymerase. After 5-min synthesis at 37 °C, the reaction product was extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1 v/v) and purified by gel filtration on a 1-ml Sephacryl S-400 column. Substrate 30 was prepared by annealing 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide C to phagemid pUC119 ssDNA as described above. The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1 v/v), and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in 10 μl of buffer Y, and cut with 5 units of SmaI for 3 h. 0.1 mm dNTP and [α-32P]dCTP were added as indicated in Table II, and the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide was extended by using the DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment. The substrate was extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1 v/v) and purified by gel filtration on a 1-ml Sephacryl S-400 column.Table IISubstratesSubstrateOligonucleotides, vectorsAdded nucleotidesa[α-32P]dCTP was always used with the exception of substrate 29.1B, T3O22dCTP2B, T3O19, T5O223B, T3O22, T5O224B, T3T165B, T5T9, T5O226B, T3O22, T3T167BD, TD8BD, TD, TINV9BD, TD, TINV5T10BD, TD, TINV3T11B, T3O19dCTP12B, T3O16dCTP, dATP, dTTP13B, T3O13dCTP, dATP14B, T3O9dCTP, dGTP15B, T3O5dCTP, dGTP, dTTP16B, T3O22, T3T917B, T3O22, T3T518B, T3O22, T3T219B, T3T920B, T3T521B, T3T222B, T5O22dCTP, dATP, dTTP23B9, T3T924B5, T3T925B2, T3T926B5, T3T527B2, T3T228B, T5O22all dNTPs29pUC119, USPall dNTPs, ddGTP30pUC119, CdCTP, dTTP, dGTPa [α-32P]dCTP was always used with the exception of substrate 29. Open table in a new tab Helicase Assay—The helicase assay mixture (10 μl) contained 1.5 nm substrate DNA (this corresponds to 70–160 nm in nucleotides for substrates made of oligonucleotides and ∼3000 nm in nucleotides for substrates based on pUC119 ssDNA), 4 mm ATP, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and Hmi1p as indicated. Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 15 min, unless otherwise specified. The reactions were stopped by adding 1.5 μl of stop solution containing 25% glycerol, 1% SDS, 0.4 m Tris, 0.4 m boric acid, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bromphenol blue and loaded directly onto 12% polyacrylamide gels (29:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide). 8% gels were used for the D loop substrates and the substrates based on pUC119 ssDNA. Electrophoresis was run at 4 °C using 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA as electrophoresis buffer. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films and to Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager screens (Amersham Biosciences) for quantitation. All of the helicase assays were repeated three times. Purification of Hmi1p—Hmi1p was overexpressed in E. coli using the pGEX-4T1 expression vector that encodes for a GST affinity tag fused to the N terminus of Hmi1p. The GST tag was removed by thrombin cleavage, and Hmi1p was subjected to chromatographic fractionation by Q-Sepharose and S-Sepharose columns. The purified protein preparation separated by SDS-PAGE is shown in Fig. 1A, lane 3. In parallel with the WT Hmi1p and by the same method, the E211Q mutant of Hmi1p, Hmi1p(E211Q), was purified. Glu-211 of Hmi1p is a conserved residue in the helicase motif II (8Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-423Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar), being a putative catalytic acid (24Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Velankar S.S. Wigley D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); thus, Hmi1p(E211Q) should be defective in regard to ATPase and helicase activities. The purified Hmi1p(E211Q) preparation separated by SDS-PAGE is shown in Fig. 1A, lane 2. Both the WT Hmi1p and the Hmi1p(E211Q) preparations contained the 75-kDa Hmi1p as the major component but also a small fraction of GST-Hmi1 fusion protein and proteins of ∼50, 35, and 30 kDa as minor contaminations. Although 0.07–0.1 mg of WT Hmi1p was routinely purified from 2 liters of bacterial culture, only 0.02 mg of Hmi1p(E211Q) could be obtained from the same amount of the bacterial culture. We also overexpressed two other mutants, Hmi1p(K32M) and Hmi1p(R275M), but these proteins could not be purified using the method described above because the GST fusion proteins were in the insoluble fraction after cell lysis (data not shown). ATPase and Helicase Activities of Hmi1p and Hmi1p(E211Q) Preparations—The ATPase activities of the WT Hmi1p and the mutant Hmi1p(E211Q) were examined at four different ATP concentrations in the presence and absence of an oligonucleotide ssDNA cofactor (for details see “Materials and Methods”). The WT Hmi1p preparation exhibited ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity with kinetic parameters for ATP hydrolysis: Km = 0.185 ± 0.037 mm and kcat = 13 ± 1 s–1. The ATPase activity without ssDNA was below the limits of detection on all of the ATP concentrations used. The mutant Hmi1p(E211Q) preparation did not show detectable ATPase activity, either in the presence or absence of ssDNA (data not shown). The helicase activities of the WT Hmi1p and the mutant Hmi1p(E211Q) were assessed in the presence and absence of ATP using substrate 1 that consisted of duplex DNA with a 3′-ssDNA overhang 22 nt in length (Fig. 1B). The WT Hmi1p showed ATP-dependent helicase activity, whereas ssDNA formation was not observed when the mutant Hmi1p(E211Q) was used. This result together with the result of the ATPase assay confirms that the ATPase and helicase activities of the Hmi1p preparation are properties of the Hmi1 helicase and not of any of the contaminating E. coli proteins. Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation of Hmi1p—The preparation of WT Hmi1p was subjected to a glycerol gradient sedimentation to determine the possible oligomerization/aggregation of Hmi1p in the preparation. Hmi1p was found to run as a single peak corresponding approximately to the monomer size of the protein (Fig. 1C). The ATPase activity appeared in the same fractions as Hmi1p, demonstrating that the monomer is the active form of the protein. Neither ATPase activity nor Hmi1p was recovered from the bottom of the tube, indicating that the purified Hmi1p was not aggregated. The Directionality of Hmi1p—The directionality of the helicase activity of Hmi1p was determined with substrate 30 consisting of the linearized pUC119 ssDNA with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides hybridized to both ends of the molecule. Hmi1p could unwind only the oligonucleotide from the 5′ end of the phagemid ssDNA (Fig. 2A). No oligonucleotide displaced from the 3′ end of the linearized pUC119 ssDNA could be detected. This result shows that Hmi1p translocates in the 3′-5′ direction on ssDNA. The Usage of Nucleotide Cofactors—Because helicases utilize the free energy derived from the hydrolysis of nucleotides to separate DNA strands, the ability of Hmi1p to hydrolyze different nucleotides was determined using the helicase assay. Hmi1p and the 22-nt 3′-ssDNA overhang containing substrate 1 were incubated in the presence of different NTP(s) and dNTP(s) (Fig. 2B). The highest enzymatic activity of Hmi1p was detected in the presence of ATP and dATP, thus these nucleotides being the preferred cofactors. Incubation in the presence of dCTP and CTP resulted in <20% activity compared with ATP. None of the other nucleoside triphosphates could support the helicase activity of Hmi1p above the limits of detection. The Processivity of Hmi1p—To estimate the processivity of Hmi1p, a heterogeneous substrate 29 was made. The substrate consisted of pUC119 ssDNA carrying oligonucleotides of different lengths synthesized in the presence of ddGTP (for details see “Materials and Methods”). The unwinding of this substrate by Hmi1p was assessed within 30 min (Fig. 3). The unwinding of 30-, 50-, 80-, and 120-nt oligonucleotides in length was quantified by phosphorimaging analysis. During a 30-min incubation, solely the 30-mer was completely unwound, whereas only ∼60% 50-mer was displaced during the same time. The unwinding of the 80- and 120-mer was far less effective (10–20% after 30 min of reaction). This demonstrates that Hmi1p preferentially unwinds short DNA duplexes. Unwinding of Substrates with Different Structures by Hmi1p—Substrates with different structures were made of oligonucleotides to characterize the substrate specificity of the protein (Fig. 4). Of 10 different substrates, Hmi1p could unwind only the ones containing a 3′-overhang or a stretch of ssDNA. The 3′-overhang was either as an extension to duplex DNA (substrate 1), in a forked structure (substrate 4), or in a flap structure (substrate 6). The ssDNA stretch, which also appeared to form a sufficient structural determinant for Hmi1p loading, was either in a bubble structure (substrate 7) or in different D-loop structures (substrates 8–10). D-loop substrates were unwound independently of the ssDNA overhangs of the invading strand, the only difference being at substrate 10 containing the invading strand with 3′-ssDNA overhang where the formation of bubble structure was detected (lane 28). This result shows that Hmi1p starts unwinding D-loop substrates from the 3′-flap structures that form in the 5′ end of ssDNA. Hmi1p could not start unwinding from a blunt end, from a nick in one strand (substrate 3), or from a 5-nt gap in one strand (substrate 2). Consistent with the previous result that Hmi1p translocates in the 3′-5′-direction on ssDNA, Hmi1p could not unwind the substrate with a 5′-flap structure (substrate 5). Minimal Length of 3′-ssDNA Overhang Necessary for Productive Hmi1p Recruitment—To determine the minimal required length of the 3′-overhang, we used substrates with 23-nt duplexes and 5-, 9-, 13-, 16-, 19-, or 22-nt 3′-overhangs, respectively. Hmi1p was incubated with these substrates, and the unwinding of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was quantified by phosphorimaging analysis. Only substrates with 19- and 22-nt overhangs could be unwound by Hmi1p (Fig. 5). Substrates with shorter 3′-overhangs could not be unwound, even by 4-fold molar excess of the protein over the substrate. Unwinding of Substrates with Forked Structures—We further examined the ability of Hmi1p to unwind different forked substrates. Three series of substrates were used: first, substrates with a 5′-overhang of constant length (23 nt) and the 3′-overhang of varying length; second, substrates with a 3′-overhang of constant length (9 nt) and th"
https://openalex.org/W2059424360,"Retinoid-related molecules are important potential agents for the treatment of cancer. In the present study, we test the effect of a novel retinoid-related ligand, AGN193198 (4-[3-(1-heptyl-4,4-dimethyl-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)-3-oxo-prophenyl] benzoic acid), on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and survival. AGN193198 treatment reduces BxPC-3 cell proliferation more efficiently than high-affinity retinoid acid receptor (RAR)- or retinoid X receptor (RXR)-selective retinoids. Moreover, AGN193198 does not activate transcription from RAR or RXR response elements and its effects on cell survival are not reversed by treatment with RAR- or RXR receptor-selective antagonists. These results suggest that the AGN193198-dependent inhibition of BxPC-3 cell function is not mediated via activation of the classical retinoid receptors. Cell cycle analysis of AGN193198-treated BxPC-3 cells indicates that AGN193198 causes accumulation of cells in G2/M. This change is associated with a marked reduction in regulators of S (cyclin A, cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)2), G2/M (cyclin B1, cdk1, cdc25c) and G1 (cyclin D1, cyclin E, cdk2, cdk4) phase, and an increase in p21 and p27 level. Kinases assays reveal that cdk1, cdk2 and cdk4 activity are suppressed in AGN193198-treated cells. In addition, reduced cell proliferation is associated with enhanced procaspase (3, 8 and 9) and PARP cleavage. Z-VAD-FMK, a pancaspase inhibitor, inhibits AGN193198-dependent caspase activation and attenuates cell death. Z-VAD-FMK inhibits PARP cleavage, but does not alter the AGN193198-dependent reduction in cell cycle regulatory protein expression and activity, suggesting that caspase activation and suppression of cell cycle regulatory protein levels are independent processes. AGN193198 produces similar responses in other pancreatic cancer cell lines including AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2. These studies suggest that AGN193198 may be useful for the treatment of pancreatic cancer."
