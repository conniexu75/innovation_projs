https://openalex.org/W1965130745,"Apoptosis occurs in essentially all tissues as part of normal development and homeostasis. Yet even in tissues with high cellular turnover, apoptotic cells are rarely seen; this has been attributed to the ability of apoptotic cells to advertise their presence via release of 'find-me' signals to recruit phagocytes and initiate prompt clearance. It has been unclear, however, what type of find-me signals are released by apoptotic cells and how these are sensed by phagocytes. In this paper apoptotic cells are shown to release ATP and UTP that act as a 'find me ' signal and chemoattractant for phagocytes expressing the P2Y2 ATP/UTP receptor. The efficient removal of apoptotic cells in vivo is thought to be due to the release of 'find-me' signals by apoptotic cells that recruit motile phagocytes. Here, the caspase-dependent release of ATP and UTP during the early stages of apoptosis is demonstrated. ATP and UTP are found to act as chemoattractants in a process mediated through the ATP/UTP receptor P2Y2, which is present on monocytes and macrophages. Phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells occurs efficiently in vivo such that even in tissues with significant apoptosis, very few apoptotic cells are detectable1. This is thought to be due to the release of ‘find-me’ signals by apoptotic cells that recruit motile phagocytes such as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, leading to the prompt clearance of the dying cells2. However, the identity and in vivo relevance of such find-me signals are not well understood. Here, through several lines of evidence, we identify extracellular nucleotides as a critical apoptotic cell find-me signal. We demonstrate the caspase-dependent release of ATP and UTP (in equimolar quantities) during the early stages of apoptosis by primary thymocytes and cell lines. Purified nucleotides at these concentrations were sufficient to induce monocyte recruitment comparable to that of apoptotic cell supernatants. Enzymatic removal of ATP and UTP (by apyrase or the expression of ectopic CD39) abrogated the ability of apoptotic cell supernatants to recruit monocytes in vitro and in vivo. We then identified the ATP/UTP receptor P2Y2 as a critical sensor of nucleotides released by apoptotic cells using RNA interference-mediated depletion studies in monocytes, and macrophages from P2Y2-null mice3. The relevance of nucleotides in apoptotic cell clearance in vivo was revealed by two approaches. First, in a murine air-pouch model, apoptotic cell supernatants induced a threefold greater recruitment of monocytes and macrophages than supernatants from healthy cells did; this recruitment was abolished by depletion of nucleotides and was significantly decreased in P2Y2-/- (also known as P2ry2-/-) mice. Second, clearance of apoptotic thymocytes was significantly impaired by either depletion of nucleotides or interference with P2Y receptor function (by pharmacological inhibition or in P2Y2-/- mice). These results identify nucleotides as a critical find-me cue released by apoptotic cells to promote P2Y2-dependent recruitment of phagocytes, and provide evidence for a clear relationship between a find-me signal and efficient corpse clearance in vivo."

The centerpiece of the project is an 800-kilometer-long, closely spaced, linear array of broadband seismographs, extending from the Ganges lowland, across the Himalayas, and onto the central Tibetan plateau. Nábělek et al. (p. 1371 ) present images of the crust and upper mantle of the Southern Tibetan plateau underthrust northward by the Indian plate, in which they trace the base of the Indian plate to 31°N. The character of the crust-mantle interface in this region suggests that the Indian crust is at least partly decoupled from the mantle beneath."
https://openalex.org/W2002740941,"Flu's Tricky Tricks After vaccination against influenza A virus, single-point mutations are selected in hemagglutinin (the virus molecule that binds to sialic acid molecules on the surface of host cells) that escape neutralization by polyclonal antibody responses. Hensley et al. (p. 734 ) have discovered that in mice these mutations increased the virus's avidity for sialic acid. Amino acid substitutions that occur during reiterations of immune escape and avidity modulation can thus drive antigenic variation. This constant evolution of influenza viruses requires us to change vaccine components annually, and, for equine influenza, Park et al. (p. 726 ) show that as the match between virus and vaccine strains drifts apart with time, the probability of becoming infected and the length of the infectious period increase to the point where outbreaks occur. Nevertheless, even imperfect vaccines may be of benefit to a population because increasing the proportion of vaccinated individuals can supply enough herd immunity to offset a poor antigenic match, especially if used in conjunction with antiviral drugs. For humans, Yang et al. (p. 729 , published online 10 September) estimate that the rate of transmission within U.S. households puts influenza A 2009 H1N1 (the current pandemic “swine flu”) in the higher range of transmissibility, compared to past seasonal and pandemic strains. Thus, to achieve mitigation this fall, children should be the first recipients of vaccine, followed by adults—aiming overall for 70% coverage of the population."
https://openalex.org/W2052586280,"Efficient Carbon Nanotube Photodiodes A single photon absorbed in a single-walled carbon nanotube device can generate multiple unbound particles carrying an electric charge. Gabor et al. (p. 1367 ) report that in such a device at low temperatures, excitation with light of increasing energy leads to well-defined stepwise increases in current. Interestingly, because of the unique band structure of carbon nanotubes, this behavior is analogous to particle-antiparticle creation commonly observed in high-energy particle physics. These observations point to the promise of investigations in other nanoscale carbon systems, such as graphene, and could lead to numerous applications, including highly sensitive photon detection and ultra-efficient photovoltaics."
https://openalex.org/W1499220571,"RNA interference (RNAi), a gene-silencing pathway triggered by double-stranded RNA, is conserved in diverse eukaryotic species but has been lost in the model budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we show that RNAi is present in other budding yeast species, including Saccharomyces castellii and Candida albicans. These species use noncanonical Dicer proteins to generate small interfering RNAs, which mostly correspond to transposable elements and Y' subtelomeric repeats. In S. castellii, RNAi mutants are viable but have excess Y' messenger RNA levels. In S. cerevisiae, introducing Dicer and Argonaute of S. castellii restores RNAi, and the reconstituted pathway silences endogenous retrotransposons. These results identify a previously unknown class of Dicer proteins, bring the tool of RNAi to the study of budding yeasts, and bring the tools of budding yeast to the study of RNAi."
https://openalex.org/W2015926166,"It's a Gas Many antibiotics, including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and quinolones, kill bacteria (at least in part) by oxidative stress. Gusarov et al. (p. 1380 ) show that nitric oxide (NO) produced by bacterial NO synthases (bNOS) protects bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis , against toxic agents they may encounter in the soil or in host organisms. Thus, bNOS activity is specifically induced in response to antibiotics and, in turn, activates the expression of another key antioxidant enzyme: superoxide dismutase. Hence, NO-mediated antibiotic resistance not only operates by direct chemical modification of toxic molecules, but also alleviates oxidative stress caused by naturally occurring antibiotics."

https://openalex.org/W2053816671,"A Lower Tunnel Among the peculiarities inherent in quantum mechanics is the ability of particles to tunnel through barriers that they lack the energy to surmount classically, as happens during radioactive decay. Strong laser fields can liberate electrons in this way from atoms and molecules. Akagi et al. (p. 1364 ) elegantly confirm that tunneling is not limited to the highest-energy electrons in a system by mapping the energy and momentum of both the ejected electron and positive ion produced when an intense laser pulse impinges on hydrogen chloride. When the molecule adopts specific orientations relative to the laser field, tunneling occurs from lower-lying states, as well as the highest-energy occupied orbital. This raises the possibility of tunneling microscopy capable of imaging the electronic structure of single molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2124327942,"Extending Quantum Memory Quantum information processing and communication relies on the ability to store, retrieve, and manipulate information stored in quantum memories. In most practical instances, however, the stored quantum information is fragile and susceptible to loss during readout. Jiang et al. (p. 267 , published online 10 September) used a combination of quantum logic operations on the electronic spin of a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond to control its interactions with a nearby set of proximal nuclear spins of the carbon network. In this setup, the quantum memory of the electron spin could be made more robust. Extending the lifetime and allowing multiple readouts of the quantum memory should prove a useful technique for quantum information processing."

Experimental confirmation of these orbital geometries remains challenging, however, particularly for molecules bound in thin layers to underlying surfaces—a morphology of increasing interest in organic semiconductor development. Puschnig et al. (p. 702 , published online 10 September) mapped the trajectories of photoelectrons emitted from polycyclic aromatic molecules deposited on copper and extracted spatial profiles of the orbitals from which these electrons emerged. The method of analysis takes advantage of the straightforward Fourier relation between position and momentum and complements orbital imaging techniques based on scanning tunneling microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1963929665,"Insulin is a critical component of metabolic control, and as such, insulin gene expression has been the focus of extensive study. DNA sequences that regulate transcription of the insulin gene and the majority of regulatory factors have already been identified. However, only recently have other components of insulin gene expression been investigated, and in this study we examine the role of DNA methylation in the regulation of mouse and human insulin gene expression.Genomic DNA samples from several tissues were bisulfite-treated and sequenced which revealed that cytosine-guanosine dinucleotide (CpG) sites in both the mouse Ins2 and human INS promoters are uniquely demethylated in insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Methylation of these CpG sites suppressed insulin promoter-driven reporter gene activity by almost 90% and specific methylation of the CpG site in the cAMP responsive element (CRE) in the promoter alone suppressed insulin promoter activity by 50%. Methylation did not directly inhibit factor binding to the CRE in vitro, but inhibited ATF2 and CREB binding in vivo and conversely increased the binding of methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Examination of the Ins2 gene in mouse embryonic stem cell cultures revealed that it is fully methylated and becomes demethylated as the cells differentiate into insulin-expressing cells in vitro.Our findings suggest that insulin promoter CpG demethylation may play a crucial role in beta cell maturation and tissue-specific insulin gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2040874707,"Background The liver is the central organ for xenobiotic metabolism (XM) and is regulated by nuclear receptors such as CAR and PXR, which control the metabolism of drugs. Here we report that gut microbiota influences liver gene expression and alters xenobiotic metabolism in animals exposed to barbiturates. Principal findings By comparing hepatic gene expression on microarrays from germfree (GF) and conventionally-raised mice (SPF), we identified a cluster of 112 differentially expressed target genes predominantly connected to xenobiotic metabolism and pathways inhibiting RXR function. These findings were functionally validated by exposing GF and SPF mice to pentobarbital which confirmed that xenobiotic metabolism in GF mice is significantly more efficient (shorter time of anesthesia) when compared to the SPF group. Conclusion Our data demonstrate that gut microbiota modulates hepatic gene expression and function by altering its xenobiotic response to drugs without direct contact with the liver."

https://openalex.org/W2033231579,"Glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) is an essential antioxidant enzyme having multiple functions. A long form Gpx4 protein and a short form Gpx4 protein, which are distinguishable by the presence or lack of a mitochondrial signal peptide at the N terminus, are generated from the Gpx4 gene. In this study, we generated transgenic mice using mutated GPX4 genes encoding either the long form Gpx4 (lGPX4 gene) or the short form Gpx4 (sGPX4 gene). Our results showed that transgenic mice with the sGPX4 gene had increased Gpx4 protein in all tissues and were protected against diquat-induced apoptosis in liver. Moreover, the sGPX4 gene was able to rescue the lethal phenotype of the mouse Gpx4-null mutation. In contrast, transgenic mice with the lGPX4 gene had increased Gpx4 protein only in the testes, and the lGPX4 gene failed to rescue the lethal phenotype of the mouse Gpx4-null mutation. In Gpx4-null mice rescued by the sGPX4 gene, the Gpx4 protein was present in mitochondria isolated from somatic tissues, and the submitochondrial distribution pattern of the Gpx4 protein in these mice was identical to that in wild-type mice. Interestingly, the male Gpx4-null mice rescued by the sGPX4 gene were infertile and exhibited sperm malformation. Together, our results demonstrated for the first time that the short form Gpx4 protein is present in somatic tissue mitochondria and is essential for survival and protection against apoptosis in mice, whereas the long form Gpx4 protein is important for male fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2030663130,"Protein acetylation is a widespread modification that is mediated by site-selective acetyltransferases. KATs (lysine Nϵ-acetyltransferases), modify the side chain of specific lysines on histones and other proteins, a central process in regulating gene expression. Nα-terminal acetylation occurs on the ribosome where the α amino group of nascent polypeptides is acetylated by NATs (N-terminal acetyltransferase). In yeast, three different NAT complexes were identified NatA, NatB, and NatC. NatA is composed of two main subunits, the catalytic subunit Naa10p (Ard1p) and Naa15p (Nat1p). Naa50p (Nat5) is physically associated with NatA. In man, hNaa50p was shown to have acetyltransferase activity and to be important for chromosome segregation. In this study, we used purified recombinant hNaa50p and multiple oligopeptide substrates to identify and characterize an Nα-acetyltransferase activity of hNaa50p. As the preferred substrate this activity acetylates oligopeptides with N termini Met-Leu-Xxx-Pro. Furthermore, hNaa50p autoacetylates lysines 34, 37, and 140 in vitro, modulating hNaa50p substrate specificity. In addition, histone 4 was detected as a hNaa50p KAT substrate in vitro. Our findings thus provide the first experimental evidence of an enzyme having both KAT and NAT activities.

KAT enzymes acetylate the ϵ-amino group of specific lysines on histone proteins as a crucial part of regulating gene expression (1Marmorstein R. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The KAT family consists of several members, but the p300 enzyme and its paralogue, CREB-binding protein (CBP), have been identified to account for most of the KAT activity (1Marmorstein R. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of p300/CBP activity has been implicated in several types of cancers and cardiac diseases (2Kalkhoven E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The NAT complexes are physically associated with ribosomes and transfer the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the N-terminal α-amino group of newly synthesized proteins (3Polevoda B. Brown S. Cardillo T.S. Rigby S. Sherman F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2008; 103: 492-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Gautschi M. Just S. Mun A. Ross S. Rücknagel P. Dubaquié Y. Ehrenhofer-Murray A. Rospert S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7403-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In yeast and humans, three different NAT complexes were identified, NatA, NatB, and NatC, whose activities were found to account for the majority of Nα-terminal acetylation (5Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 595-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The yeast NatA complex is composed of the catalytic subunit Naa10p (earlier known as Ard1p (6Polevoda B. Arnesen T. Sherman F. BMC Proc. 2009; 3: S2Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and the auxiliary subunit Naa15p (earlier known as Nat1p (6Polevoda B. Arnesen T. Sherman F. BMC Proc. 2009; 3: S2Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Park E.C. Szostak J.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2087-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)). The yNatA complex has a broad substrate specificity acetylating proteins with Ser, Ala, Gly, Val, Cys, or Thr N termini (8Arnesen T. Van Damme P. Polevoda B. Helsens K. Evjenth R. Colaert N. Varhaug J.E. Vandekerckhove J. Lillehaug J.R. Sherman F. Gevaert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8157-8162Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). A third subunit, Naa50p (earlier known as Nat5p (6Polevoda B. Arnesen T. Sherman F. BMC Proc. 2009; 3: S2Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), was found to be physically associated with the yNatA complex, but no influence on the NatA activity was detected (4Gautschi M. Just S. Mun A. Ross S. Rücknagel P. Dubaquié Y. Ehrenhofer-Murray A. Rospert S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7403-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The presence of a third subunit in the NatA complex has also been demonstrated in the fruit fly, dSan (9Williams B.C. Garrett-Engele C.M. Li Z. Williams E.V. Rosenman E.D. Goldberg M.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2025-2036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and human, hNaa50p (hNat5p) (10Arnesen T. Anderson D. Torsvik J. Halseth H.B. Varhaug J.E. Lillehaug J.R. Gene. 2006; 371: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, human Naa50p was reported to acetylate itself and purified chromosome pellets in vitro (11Hou F. Chu C.W. Kong X. Yokomori K. Zou H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Loss of this protein led to chromatid cohesion defects in both the fruit fly and humans (9Williams B.C. Garrett-Engele C.M. Li Z. Williams E.V. Rosenman E.D. Goldberg M.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2025-2036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 11Hou F. Chu C.W. Kong X. Yokomori K. Zou H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study of Naa50p in the fruit fly demonstrated its importance in chromosome resolution and segregation (12Pimenta-Marques A. Tostões R. Marty T. Barbosa V. Lehmann R. Martinho R.G. Dev. Biol. 2008; 323: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). HeLa cells with small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of hNAA10 and hNAA15, showed decreased acetylation levels of several proteins matching the predicted NatA specificity (8Arnesen T. Van Damme P. Polevoda B. Helsens K. Evjenth R. Colaert N. Varhaug J.E. Vandekerckhove J. Lillehaug J.R. Sherman F. Gevaert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8157-8162Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In addition, one protein, having an N-terminal sequence that deviated from the NatA substrate pattern, was also less acetylated in hNAA10/hNAA15 knockdown cells. This protein, hnRNP F, has the N-terminal protein sequence MLGPEGG (8Arnesen T. Van Damme P. Polevoda B. Helsens K. Evjenth R. Colaert N. Varhaug J.E. Vandekerckhove J. Lillehaug J.R. Sherman F. Gevaert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8157-8162Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). It has been established that knockdown of either hNAA10 or hNAA15 in HeLa cells causes a reduced level of the hNaa50p protein (11Hou F. Chu C.W. Kong X. Yokomori K. Zou H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore hnRNP F may represent a potential hNaa50p substrate in vivo. In this study, the important issue of whether hNaa50p is a bifunctional NAT and KAT enzyme has been addressed. Based on in vitro activity assays and mass spectrometric analyses, it is demonstrated that hNaa50p indeed possesses both NAT and KAT activities. Autoacetylation of hNaa50p was observed in lysine residues 34, 37, and 140, and hNaa50p specifically acetylated histone 4 in vitro. The preferred N-terminal sequence for the NAT activity of hNaa50p matches the sequence of the hypothesized in vivo substrate, hnRNP F. Overexpression and immunoprecipitation of Xpress-hNaa50p were done as described (13Arnesen T. Anderson D. Baldersheim C. Lanotte M. Varhaug J.E. Lillehaug J.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The acetyltransferase assay used to test the Xp-hNaa50p activity and the initial peptide screen were performed as described previously (13Arnesen T. Anderson D. Baldersheim C. Lanotte M. Varhaug J.E. Lillehaug J.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The enzyme was incubated in 250 μl of KAT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA) with 5 μl of [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (56 mCi/mmol, GE Healthcare) and 2.5 μl of custom made peptide (2 mm; Biogenes) as substrates. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the peptides were isolated using SP-Sepharose resin (Sigma). Incorporation of acetyl groups was determined by scintillation counting. Because the first residues of the peptide seemed to be most important for enzyme specificity (5Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 595-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), all peptides used in this study vary only within the 7 first N-terminal positions. The next 17 amino acids, indicated by “RRR,” are identical for all peptides and resemble the sequence of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), except, all Lys residues have been replaced by Arg to minimize the potential interference by Nϵ-acetylation. The positively charged Arg residues facilitate peptide solubility and effective isolation by cation exchange Sepharose beads. See supplemental Table S1 for peptide sequence information. Prokaryotic expression and purification of recombinant protein was conducted as described (14Arnesen T. Kong X. Evjenth R. Gromyko D. Varhaug J.E. Lin Z. Sang N. Caro J. Lillehaug J.R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6428-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding hNaa50p was cloned into pETM-glutathione S-transferase (GST) (G. Stier, EMBL, Germany) for expression in Escherichia coli. The plasmid encoding Xpress-tagged hNaa50p was previously described (10Arnesen T. Anderson D. Torsvik J. Halseth H.B. Varhaug J.E. Lillehaug J.R. Gene. 2006; 371: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity of hNaa50p was determined by reverse phase HPLC as described (15Evjenth R. Hole K. Ziegler M. Lillehaug J.R. BMC Proc. 2009; 3: S5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elution times of unmodified peptides were established by injecting pure unmodified peptide on the HPLC system, collecting fractions that corresponded to the absorbance peak of the peptide, and verification of the mass by mass spectrometry (see Fig. 4A). Kinetic parameters were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using the SigmaPlot Technical Graphing Software (SPSS Inc.). Elution times of acetylated peptides were determined by collecting fractions of corresponding absorbance peaks and verifying the molecular mass by MS. The MS data showed increased molecular masses of ∼42 Da, consistent with the acetylation of one residue. Prior to the MS analyses, the samples were diluted 1:1 with a matrix solution consisting of 8 μg/μl alfa-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 60% acetonitrile, 15% methanol, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. 1 μl of the sample/matrix mixtures was placed on the target plate (Bruker Daltonics, MTP 384 polished steel). The MALDI-TOF MS analyses were performed with an Ultraflex mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltronics) in a positive-ion mode. Peptide calibration standard (Bruker Daltonics) was mixed 1:1 with matrix solution and placed on the target along with the samples and used for external calibration. Xpress-hNaa50p and purified GST-hNaa50p separated by SDS-PAGE were excised from gels and washed twice in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile. Prior to protease treatment the washed gel pieces were dehydrated by vacuum centrifugation and subsequently treated with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide for reduction and alkylation of cysteines as described (16Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). “In gel” digestion with Lys-C endoproteinase was carried out essentially as described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). The digested peptides were purified and concentrated as described (17Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), and MALDI-TOF MS and MS/MS analyses were performed with an Ultraflex mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltronics) and a matrix solution consisting of 8 μg/μl alfa-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 60% acetonitrile, 15% methanol, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Mutagenesis was performed as recommended by Stratagene. See supplemental data for primer sequences. The identities of GST-hNaa50p mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. 22.5 μl of purified hNaa50p (0.8 mg/ml) was mixed with 37.5 μl of [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (56 mCi/mmol, GE Healthcare) and 262.5 μl of KAT buffer. The mixture was distributed into 2 tubes. One tube was incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots were collected after 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. The other tube was incubated at 4 °C, and an aliquot was collected after 120 min. The enzyme activity was quenched by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For kinetic analyses of the autoacetylation reaction, 5 μm GST-hNaa50p was incubated with 500 μm acetyl-CoA containing [1-14C]acetyl-CoA and KAT buffer at 37 °C. Aliquots were collected at six different time points and the enzyme reaction stopped by cooling and adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Autoacetylated GST-hNaa50p was isolated by reverse phase HPLC and analyzed by scintillation counting. Autoacetylation of GST-hNaa50p WT, or its R84A and Y124F mutants was performed adding 10 μl of the purified GST fusion protein (11 μm) to 30 μl of KAT buffer and 5 μl of non-radioactive acetyl-CoA (5 mm). The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the activity quenched by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Acetylation was detected by Western blotting using an anti-acLys antibody (Upstate). The NAT assay was performed in the presence of 100 μm acetyl-CoA, 30 μm 1MLGP-RRR24 peptide, and 50 nm of each enzyme in KAT buffer. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to adding trifluoroacetic acid to 1% (v/v). The resulting acetylation was analyzed using reverse phase HPLC as described above. For autoacetylation assays with GST-hNaa50p WT and the different lysine mutants, 2.4 μm protein was mixed with 500 μm acetyl-CoA in the above mentioned KAT buffer. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the activity quenched by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Acetylation was detected by Western blotting using an anti-acLys antibody (Upstate). To explore the effect of autoacetylation on the NAT activity of hNaa50p, 10 μm purified GST-hNaa50p was incubated at 37 °C for 120 h with either 300 μm acetyl-CoA or H2O as control in KAT buffer. An extensive incubation was chosen to ensure a high yield of autoacetylation. To determine Km values for 1MLGP-RRR24 or 1MIGP-RRR24 using these enzyme variants, 30 nm autoacetylated GST-hNaa50p was incubated with either 1MLGP-RRR24 (20–400 μm) or 1MIGP-RRR24 (50–500 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min with saturating levels of acetyl-CoA (300 μm). The activity was quenched by adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). The KAT activity of hNaa50p toward other proteins was measured using 2 μm pre-autoacetylated hNaa50p, non-preautoacetylated hNaa50p, or bovine serum albumin in the presence of 2 μm of the indicated protein substrates and 80 μm acetyl-CoA. The samples were incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots were collected after 0, 30, and 60 min. The activity was quenched by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Acetylation was detected by Western blotting using an anti-acLys antibody (Upstate). In vitro acetyltransferase assays were performed using immunoprecipitated Xp-hNaa50p from human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Xp-hNaa50p did not extensively acetylate a 1SESS-RRR24 oligopeptide, a known hNatA substrate (8Arnesen T. Van Damme P. Polevoda B. Helsens K. Evjenth R. Colaert N. Varhaug J.E. Vandekerckhove J.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8157-8162Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), whereas the 1MLGP-RRR24 oligopeptide was readily acetylated (Fig. 1). This experiment indicates that hNaa50p expressed in cell cultures has Nα-acetyltransferase activity toward an oligopeptide whose N terminus is identical to that of the hnRNP F protein. To establish the substrate specificity of hNaa50p in comparison to known NAT complexes, oligopeptides with N termini matching known NatA, NatB, and NatC substrates were tested. The putative hNaa50p substrate 1MLGP-RRR24 and two peptides known to be Nα-acetylated in vivo, but by unknown enzymes (8Arnesen T. Van Damme P. Polevoda B. Helsens K. Evjenth R. Colaert N.

For these experiments, hNaa50p N-terminal fused to GST was expressed in E. coli. The purified enzyme most efficiently acetylated oligopeptides with Met-Leu N termini corresponding to putative substrates of hNatC and hNaa50p (18Starheim K.K. Gromyko D. Evjenth R. Ryningen A. Varhaug J.E. Lillehaug J.R. Arnesen T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3569-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The NatA substrates, 1SESS-RRR24 and 1SYSM-RRR24, were not acetylated (Fig. 2). To characterize the enzyme specificity in more detail, several additional oligopeptides with different N termini were tested (Fig. 3 and Tables 1 and 2). The calculating specificity constants (V/K), show that hNaa50p has high specificity toward oligopeptides starting with ML and with a relatively small residue in the third position. Peptides with the N-terminal sequence MD and MK were not acetylated at detectable levels (Table 2). Interestingly, the 1MLGP-RRR24 (representing hnRNP F) and 1MLDP-RRR24 (1MLGP-RRR24 G3D) peptides were the best substrates. Table 1 shows kinetic parameters obtained for acetyl-CoA and the best in vitro oligopeptide substrate found so far, 1MLGP-RRR24. The Km for acetyl-CoA was estimated to be 6.9 μm, whereas the Km for the 1MLGP-RRR24 peptide was determined to be ∼75 μm with a kcat of 7 min−1.TABLE 2hNaa50p steady-state kinetic parameters for tested oligopeptide substratesPeptide substrates (N terminus)Kmkcatμmmin−11MLGPE-RRR2479 ± 67.2 ± 0.71MLDPE-RRR2491 ± 127.2 ± 1.61MIGPE-RRR24185 ± 2010.9 ± 3aVmax value (picomole of acetylated peptide min−1 pmol of hNaa50p−1) is given.1MLALI-RRR24190 ± 706.8 ± 0.41MLGTG-RRR24320 ± 202.3 ± 0.21MLGTE-RRR24416 ± 1855.6 ± 0.11MLRPE-RRR24460 ± 94—bDue to high Km values for these oligopeptide, it was not possible to determine kcat at [peptide] ≫ Km.1MLLPE-RRR24478 ± 305—bDue to high Km values for these oligopeptide, it was not possible to determine kcat at [peptide] ≫ Km.1MFGPE-RRR243734 ± 815—bDue to high Km values for these oligopeptide, it was not possible to determine kcat at [peptide] ≫ Km.1MKEEV-RRR24—cThese oligopeptides were tested as substrates, but were not acetylated to a detectable level under our assay conditions.—cThese oligopeptides were tested as substrates, but were not acetylated to a detectable level under our assay conditions.1MDELF-RRR24—cThese oligopeptides were tested as substrates, but were not acetylated to a detectable level under our assay conditions.—cThese oligopeptides were tested as substrates, but were not acetylated to a detectable level under our assay conditions.a Vmax value (picomole of acetylated peptide min−1 pmol of hNaa50p−1) is given.b Due to high Km values for these oligopeptide, it was not possible to determine kcat at [peptide] ≫ Km.c These oligopeptides were tested as substrates, but were not acetylated to a detectable level under our assay conditions.

Open table in a new tab To verify that the observed modification catalyzed by hNaa50p was indeed the transfer of an acetyl group to the peptide N terminus, modified and unmodified 1MLAL-RRR24 peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 4A). The resulting MS profiles of non-acetylated 1MLAL-RRR24 peptide (upper panel) revealed a MALDI molecular ion of m/z 2947.68, which is consistent with the theoretical molecular mass of the peptide (2947.7 Da). Acetylation of the 1MLAL-RRR24 peptide (lower panel) should increase its molecular mass by 42 Da. Indeed a MALDI molecular ion of m/z 2990.12 was detected in the MS analyses (Fig. 4A). Chemically N-terminal-acetylated 1MLGP-RRR24 peptide was then used as substrate in the hNaa50p acetylation assay to test whether additional acetylation could occur. The N-terminal acetylated 1MLGP-RRR24 (Ac-1MLGP-RRR24) peptide was not further acetylated as shown in Fig. 4B. These data further suggest that hNaa50p is an authentic NAT acetylating proteins at their N termini. hNaa50p was earlier reported to perform autoacetylation, indicative of an Nϵ-acetyltransferase activity (11Hou F. Chu C.W. Kong X. Yokomori K. Zou H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To study if hNaa50p is acetylated in vivo, Xp-hNaa50p expressed in HeLa cells was isolated and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Two peptides in the mass spectrometry spectra showed m/z ratios at 2173.19 and 1987.08, corresponding to acetylated Lys34 (supplemental Fig. S1A) and Lys140 (supplemental Fig. S1B), respectively. This acetylation could indicate that hNaa50p is a substrate for an unknown KAT, or that it acetylates itself. To test the possibility of autoacetylation, hNaa50p from an E. coli extract was purified and incubated with [1-14C]acetyl-CoA at 37 or 4 °C. Incubation at 37 °C showed a time-dependent increase in radioactively labeled protein, whereas the hNaa50p protein being incubated at 4 °C had no detectable level of acetylation (Fig. 5A). To quantify the autoacetylation reaction, purified GST-hNaa50p was incubated with [1-14C]acetyl-CoA at 37 °C, and aliquots were collected at 6 different time points. GST-hNaa50p was isolated by reverse phase HPLC and the extent of modification determined by scintillation counting (Fig. 5B). Given that 150 pmol of GST-hNaa50p incorporated 2.7 pmol of acetyl groups over a time period of 5 min, this assay suggests an enzyme turnover that is almost 2000 times slower than the highest recorded value for the acetylation of NAT substrate (Table 2). Because the autoacetylation assay does not discriminate between Nα-terminal acetylation and Nϵ-acetylation, the site(s) of modification were identified. GST-hNaa50p was autoacetylated for 60 min and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Moreover, the protein was digested with the Lys-C endoprotease, which is unable to cleave C-terminal acetylated lysines (19Dormeyer W. Ott M. Schnölzer M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1226-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The mass spectrometry analyses of the resulting peptides revealed three MALDI molecular ions of m/z 1552.769, 1986.980, and 2173.072, corresponding to predicted peptides with a 42-Da increase compared with their theoretical molecular masses (supplemental Fig. S2). An acetylated internal lysine was verified in all peptides by MS/MS analyses and established y- and b-ion series covering the acetylated lysine residues (supplemental Fig. S2, B–D). In addition, a specific acetyllysine marker ion at m/z 126 was detected in all MALDI MS/MS experiments further confirming that an acetylated lysine is present in the peptides (19Dormeyer W. Ott M. Schnölzer M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1226-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Sequence mapping of hNaa50p using the MS results identified lysines 34 and 140 as acetylated, the same residues as detected in vivo. In addition, lysine 37 was also observed as acetylated in vitro. In KAT assays, a significant amount of acetyl-CoA spontaneously reacts with substrate lysines (20Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.H. Howard R.M. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18157-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), a reaction that can lead to a false-positive interpretation of the acetylation assays. To verify that the observed autoacetylation of hNaa50p was due to enzymatic activity and not a chemical acetylation, we attempted to generate mutants of hNaa50p that were expected to have reduced enzyme activity. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of hNaa50p with proteins in the GCN5 family from yeast, Tetrahymena, and human, show that Arg84 of hNaa50p is central in the acetyl-CoA binding motif 84RRLGIG (Fig. 6A). The same alignment indicated that Tyr124 is positioned in Motif B, which is a region of the GCN5 superfamily that was predicted to be essential for catalytic activity (11Hou F. Chu C.W. Kong X. Yokomori K. Zou H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Trievel R.C. Rojas J.R. Sterner D.E. Venkataramani R.N. Wang L. Zhou J. Allis C.D. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8931-8936Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, a mutant hNaa50p was generated in which Arg84 was substituted by Ala, and Tyr124 was replaced by Phe. In a NAT assay, using 1MLGP-RRR24 as oligopeptide substrate, more than 80% of the activity was lost for the R84A mutant, whereas the Y124F mutant had ∼90% less activity than the wild type enzyme (Fig. 6B). Although both mutants still contained the three lysine residues identified as autoacetylation targets, a clear decrease in the acetylation signal was observed (Fig. 6C). Therefore, the contribution of non-enzymatic acetylation in the KAT assays presented is negligible. Collectively these data indicate that hNaa50p is acetylated in vivo and that it can perform autoacetylation in vitro in the same residues, consistent with a possible in vivo autoacetylation. The observed autoacetylation pattern was further supported using mutants of GST-hNaa50p in which Lys residues 34, 37, or 140 were replaced by Arg. In addition, a double mutant, hNaa50p K34R/K37R, and a triple mutant hNaa50p K34R/K37R/K140R were made. KAT assays with GST-hNaa50p WT and these mutants showed significantly reduced acetylation for the mutants, confirming the identification of these three Lys residues as the major targets for hNaa50p autoacetylation (Fig. 7). The potential effect of autoacetylation on NAT activity was explored by determining the kinetic constants for the best in vitro substrate 1MLGP-RRR24 and 1MIGP-RRR24 using pre-autoacetylated and non-preautoacetylated GST-hNaa50p. These assays show that autoacetylation leads to an increase in the enzyme specificity for both oligopeptide substrates (Fig. 8). The autoacetylation led to a 2-fold decrease of the Km values and a doubling of the maximal reaction rate (Table 3).TABLE 3Effect of autoacetylation on kinetic constantsNon pre-autoacetylated hNaa50pPre-autoacetylated hNaa50pKmVmaxaVmax is given in picomole of acetylated peptide min−1 pmol of hNaa50p−1.KmVmaxaVmax is given in picomole of acetylated peptide min−1 pmol of hNaa50p−1.μmμm1MLGP-RRR2462 ± 107 ± 1.533 ± 5.512 ± 31MIGP-RRR24186 ± 3710.9 ± 380 ± 8.320.7 ± 3.6a Vmax is given in picomole of acetylated peptide min−1 pmol of hNaa50p−1. Open table in a new tab It was also investigated whether the KAT activity of hNaa50p might be directed toward other proteins. Several proteins known to be KAT modified in vivo were tested. No modification was observed when using GST-p53, GST-ODD (Oxygen dependent degradation domain within hypoxia-inducible factor-1α), or human rhSP1 (transcription factor specificity protein 1 (22Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar)) as substrates (data not shown). However, hNaa50p KAT activity was detectable when using histone 4 as substrate. As shown in Fig. 9, a time-dependent acetylation of histone 4 was observed, as detected by anti-acLys antibodies, but only for the non-preautoacetylated GST-hNaa50p variant (Fig. 9). As negative control, GST-hNaa50p was replaced with an equal concentration of bovine serum albumin. To find some indications of how hNaa50p can perform both NAT and KAT functions, a structural superimposition of hNaa50p (Protein data bank code 2OB0) on a known NAT enzyme from Salmonella typhimurium RimL (PDB code 1S7N), and a known KAT enzyme, GNAT from Bacillus cereus (PDB code 3BLN) was performed (Fig. 10). All three structures were also superimposed on a KAT from Tetrahymena (PDB code 1PU9) that had been co-crystallized with a 19-residue oligopeptide of the H3 substrate (residue 5–23). The purpose of this structural comparison was to get an indication of how the Nϵ-substrate could interact with hNaa50p (Fig. 10). The analyses showed that hNaa50p shares some of the flexible structural elements with GCN5. They both have loops in the entry of the substrate binding cleft (Fig. 10, A and C). In contrast, the corresponding area of RimL is composed of an antiparallel β-sheet on one side of the cleft and two short α-helixes on the other side (Fig. 10B). Proteomic analyses of HeLa cell lysates, where the NatA complex was knocked down with small interfering RNAs, demonstrated reduced acetylation levels of a protein with an N-terminal sequence that did not fit with the expected hNatA substrate specificity (8Arnesen T. Van Damme P. Polevoda B. Helsens K. Evjenth R. Colaert N. Varhaug J.E. Vandekerckhove J. Lillehaug J.R. Sherman F. Gevaert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8157-8162Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Based on the N-terminal sequence (1MLGPEGG7), the protein was identified to be hnRNP F, a protein that is known to interact with members of the nuclear cap-binding complex (23Gamberi C. Izaurralde E. Beisel C. Mattaj I.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2587-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because knockdown of the human NatA complex causes reduced levels of the physical interactor hNaa50p (11Hou F. Chu C.W. Kong X. Yokomori K. Zou H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S3), it is reasonable to speculate that the reduction of hnRNP F acetylation could be explained by a reduced amount of hNaa50p. Immunoprecipitated hNaa50p did indeed acetylate 1MLGP-RRR24, whereas only very low activity was observed using the NatA substrate 1SESS-RRR24 (Fig. 1). The latter also excluded the potential presence of the catalytical subunit of NatA (hNaa10p) in the precipitates. Kinetic experiments show that NAT substrates with the third residue small and hydrophobic, 1MLGP-RRR24, or negatively charged, 1MLDP-RRR24, function equally well as substrates. If the third position is positively charged as in 1MLRP-RRR24, acetylation is more than 5-fold reduced, based on the V/K constant (Fig. 3). Also, Leu in the third position, 1MLLP-RRR24, is suboptimal for enzyme activity. Interestingly, Pro in the fourth position, 1MLGP-RRR24, is preferred in the hNaa50p substrates, because the V/K constant of the 1MLGTE-RRR24 peptide decreased by a factor of 2 (Fig. 3). The change from Pro to Thr has a minor effect on the kcat, but the Km is more than 4-fold increased (Table 2), indicating a weakened enzyme-substrate interaction. In contrast, the presence of Pro in position 2 is associated with reduced N-terminal acetylation by the NatA complex (5Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 595-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 8Arnesen T. Van Damme P. Polevoda B. Helsens K. Evjenth R. Colaert N. Varhaug J.E. Vandekerckhove J. Lillehaug J.R. Sherman F. Gevaert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8157-8162Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The specificity of hNaa50p appears relatively similar to the specificity of the yeast NatC complex. In yeast, NatC acetylate peptides with N termini ML, MF, and MW (5Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 595-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In contrast to yNatC, Phe in the second position leads to a dramatic increase in the Km value (Table 2). Recent findings on the human NatC complex suggest that hNaa30p (hMak3, the catalytic subunit of hNatC) has a conserved substrate specificity from yeast (18Starheim K.K. Gromyko D. Evjenth R. Ryningen A. Varhaug J.E. Lillehaug J.R. Arnesen T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3569-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In vitro acetylation assays showed that hNaa30p-acetylated oligopeptides with N-terminal sequences of 1MLALI-RRR24, 1MLGTG-RRR24, and 1MLGTE-RRR24 are more than 2-fold better than 1MLGPE-RRR24. Therefore, the substrate preference regarding the ML group of peptides differs between hNaa50p and hNatC. This implies that hNaa50p and hNaa30p acetylate similar, but distinct N-terminal substrates in vivo, and that the hNaa50p activity is restricted to a specific subset of substrates previously assumed to be NatC substrates. hNaa50p was earlier reported to perform autoacetylation, which most likely represents Nϵ-acetylation. The results of the present study verify this supposition. Moreover, they strongly suggest that autoacetylation of hNaa50p is of physiological relevance. Lysine residues 34 and 140 were identified as acetylation target sites both when the protein was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells or autoacetylated in vitro. Moreover, autoacetylation led to an increase in its NAT, but not KAT activity. Autoacetylation of hNaa50p leads to an increased enzyme specificity as indicated by a decreased Km value and increased enzyme activity. This appears to be a general effect as it was observed for both a highly preferred (1MLGP-RRR24) and suboptimal substrate (1MIGP-RRR24). The decrease in Km indicates an improved enzyme-substrate interaction and autoacetylation may thus reflect a potential specificity switch in vivo. Besides its autoacetylation, hNaa50p might also exert KAT activity toward other proteins. Although no such activity could be detected using GST-p53, GST-ODD, or rhSP1 as substrates, histone 4 was modified. Interestingly, whereas the NAT activity of hNaa50p was enhanced by autoacetylation, the KAT activity toward histone 4 was clearly reduced. This could indicate that autoacetylation mediates increased enzyme specificity. Further studies are required to establish whether or not histone 4 is a hNaa50p KAT substrate in vivo. The observed phenotypes following silencing of Naa50p/San in Drosophila or human cells (9Williams B.C. Garrett-Engele C.M. Li Z. Williams E.V. Rosenman E.D. Goldberg M.L. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2025-2036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 11Hou F. Chu C.W. Kong X. Yokomori K. Zou H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) indicate that important in vivo substrates are involved in sister chromatid cohesion. Blastp searches in the Swiss-Prot data base (version 56.0) for human proteins that match the preferred N-terminal sequence for the NAT activity of hNaa50p resulted in several hits, including TIMELESS-interacting protein, a protein that is reportedly involved in chromatid cohesion (24Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2729-2740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25Gotter A.L. Suppa C. Emanuel B.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 36-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table S3). hNaa50p is the first acetyltransferase to be identified as having both NAT and KAT activity. Several KAT enzymes have been structurally determined, but only a few NAT structures from prokaryotic organisms were solved. Therefore it is difficult to explain the dual acetylation capacity of hNaa50p in structural terms. However, comparison of the structures provided some hints. hNaa50p is constructed with flexible loops in the entry site of the substrate binding cleft (Fig. 10C). This is a structural property that hNaa50p shares with the KAT enzymes (Fig. 10A). These loops could allow for flexibility to accommodate larger substrates, such as protein surfaces that could make a productive interaction with hNaa50p. RimL, representing the NAT enzymes, has in the corresponding area an antiparallel β-sheet on one side and two short α-helixes on the other (Fig. 10B). These secondary structures are expected to be more rigid and hence reduce the area of interaction possibly required for ϵ-acetylation. In conclusion, hNaa50p displays Nα-acetyltransferase activity and prefers substrates that have ML at their N termini. In addition, hNaa50p has the capacity for Nϵ-autoacetylation, targeting Lys34, Lys37, and Lys140. It is thus the first identified bifunctional protein acetyltransferase exhibiting both KAT and NAT activities. We thank E. Skjelvik, L. Vikebø, M. Algrøy, H. Halseth, and N.

https://openalex.org/W2100232206,"Feeling touch on a body part is paradigmatically considered to require stimulation of tactile afferents from the body part in question, at least in healthy non-synaesthetic individuals. In contrast to this view, we report a perceptual illusion where people experience “phantom touches” on a right rubber hand when they see it brushed simultaneously with brushes applied to their left hand. Such illusory duplication and transfer of touch from the left to the right hand was only elicited when a homologous (i.e., left and right) pair of hands was brushed in synchrony for an extended period of time. This stimulation caused the majority of our participants to perceive the right rubber hand as their own and to sense two distinct touches – one located on the right rubber hand and the other on their left (stimulated) hand. This effect was supported by quantitative subjective reports in the form of questionnaires, behavioral data from a task in which participants pointed to the felt location of their right hand, and physiological evidence obtained by skin conductance responses when threatening the model hand. Our findings suggest that visual information augments subthreshold somatosensory responses in the ipsilateral hemisphere, thus producing a tactile experience from the non-stimulated body part. This finding is important because it reveals a new bilateral multisensory mechanism for tactile perception and limb ownership."
https://openalex.org/W2148085682,"Background The role of race in human genetics and biomedical research is among the most contested issues in science. Much debate centers on the relative importance of genetic versus sociocultural factors in explaining racial inequalities in health. However, few studies integrate genetic and sociocultural data to test competing explanations directly. Methodology/Principal Findings We draw on ethnographic, epidemiologic, and genetic data collected in southeastern Puerto Rico to isolate two distinct variables for which race is often used as a proxy: genetic ancestry versus social classification. We show that color, an aspect of social classification based on the culturally defined meaning of race in Puerto Rico, better predicts blood pressure than does a genetic-based estimate of continental ancestry. We also find that incorporating sociocultural variables reveals a new and significant association between a candidate gene polymorphism for hypertension (α2C adrenergic receptor deletion) and blood pressure. Conclusions/Significance This study addresses the recognized need to measure both genetic and sociocultural factors in research on racial inequalities in health. Our preliminary results provide the most direct evidence to date that previously reported associations between genetic ancestry and health may be attributable to sociocultural factors related to race and racism, rather than to functional genetic differences between racially defined groups. Our results also imply that including sociocultural variables in future research may improve our ability to detect significant allele-phenotype associations. Thus, measuring sociocultural factors related to race may both empower future genetic association studies and help to clarify the biological consequences of social inequalities."
https://openalex.org/W1964060538,"Increasing evidence points to an important role for hemozoin (HZ), the malaria pigment, in the immunopathology related to this infection. However, there is no consensus as to whether HZ exerts its immunostimulatory activity in absence of other parasite or host components. Contamination of native HZ preparations and the lack of a unified protocol to produce crystals that mimic those of Plasmodium HZ (PHZ) are major technical limitants when performing functional studies with HZ. In fact, the most commonly used methods generate a heterogeneous nanocrystalline material. Thus, it is likely that such aggregates do not resemble to PHZ and differ in their inflammatory properties. To address this issue, the present study was designed to establish whether synthetic HZ (sHZ) crystals produced by different methods vary in their morphology and in their ability to activate immune responses. We report a new method of HZ synthesis (the precise aqueous acid-catalyzed method) that yields homogeneous sHZ crystals (Plasmodium-like HZ) which are very similar to PHZ in their size and physicochemical properties. Importantly, these crystals are devoid of protein and DNA contamination. Of interest, structure-function studies revealed that the size and shape of the synthetic crystals influences their ability to activate inflammatory responses (e.g. nitric oxide, chemokine and cytokine mRNA) in vitro and in vivo. In summary, our data confirm that sHZ possesses immunostimulatory properties and underline the importance of verifying by electron microscopy both the morphology and homogeneity of the synthetic crystals to ensure that they closely resemble those of the parasite. Periodic quality control experiments and unification of the method of HZ synthesis are key steps to unravel the role of HZ in malaria immunopathology."
https://openalex.org/W1994787638,"Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) protects against atherosclerosis by regulating the activation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta) in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Activated PDGFRbeta undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequently interacts with various signaling molecules, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine 739/750 residues in mice, and thus regulates actin polymerization and cell movement.In this study, we found disorganized actin in the form of membrane ruffling and enhanced cell migration in LRP1-deficient (LRP1-/-) SMCs. Marfan syndrome-like phenotypes such as tortuous aortas, disrupted elastic layers and abnormally activated transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling are present in smooth muscle-specific LRP1 knockout (smLRP1-/-) mice. To investigate the role of LRP1-regulated PI3K activation by PDGFRbeta in atherogenesis, we generated a strain of smLRP1-/- mice in which tyrosine 739/750 of the PDGFRbeta had been mutated to phenylalanines (PDGFRbeta F2/F2). Spontaneous atherosclerosis was significantly reduced in the absence of hypercholesterolemia in these mice compared to smLRP1-/- animals that express wild type PDGFR. Normal actin organization was restored and spontaneous SMC migration as well as PDGF-BB-induced chemotaxis was dramatically reduced, despite continued overactivation of TGFbeta signaling, as indicated by high levels of nuclear phospho-Smad2.Our data suggest that LRP1 regulates actin organization and cell migration by controlling PDGFRbeta-dependent activation of PI3K. TGFbeta activation alone is not sufficient for the expression of the Marfan-like vascular phenotype. Thus, regulation of PI3 Kinase by PDGFRbeta is essential for maintaining vascular integrity, and for the prevention of atherosclerosis as well as Marfan syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2004364477,"Background The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza emerged in the year 1996 in Asia, and has spread to Europe and Africa recently. At present, effective monitoring and data analysis of H5N1 are not sufficient in Chinese mainland. Methodology/Principal Findings During the period from April of 2004 to August of 2007, we collected 14,472 wild bird samples covering 56 species of 10 orders in 14 provinces of China and monitored the prevalence of flu virus based on RT-PCR specific for H5N1 subtype. The 149 positive samples involved six orders. Anseriformes had the highest prevalence while Passeriformes had the lowest prevalence (2.70% versus 0.36%). Among the 24 positive species, mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) had the highest prevalence (4.37%). A difference of prevalence was found among 14 provinces. Qinghai had a higher prevalence than the other 13 provinces combined (3.88% versus 0.43%). The prevalence in three species in Qinghai province (Pintail (Anas acuta), Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and Tufted Duck (Aythya fuligula)) were obviously higher than those in other 13 provinces. The results of sequence analysis indicated that the 17 strains isolated from wild birds were distributed in five clades (2.3.1, 2.2, 2.5, 6, and 7), which suggested that genetic diversity existed among H5N1 viruses isolated from wild birds. The five isolates from Qinghai came from one clade (2.2) and had a short evolutionary distance with the isolates obtained from Qinghai in the year 2005. Conclusions/Significance We have measured the prevalence of H5N1 virus in 56 species of wild birds in 14 provinces of China. Continuous monitoring in the field should be carried out to know whether H5N1 virus can be maintained by wild birds."
https://openalex.org/W2045660156,"In Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) cell lines, specific nuclear bodies called APBs (ALT-associated PML bodies) concentrate telomeric DNA, shelterin components and recombination factors associated with telomere recombination. Topoisomerase IIIα (Topo III) is an essential telomeric-associated factor in ALT cells. We show here that the binding of Topo III to telomeric G-overhang is modulated by G-quadruplex formation. Topo III binding to G-quadruplex-forming oligonucleotides was strongly inhibited by telomestatin, a potent and specific G-quadruplex ligand. In ALT cells, telomestatin treatment resulted in the depletion of the Topo III/BLM/TRF2 complex and the disruption of APBs and led to the segregation of PML, shelterin components and Topo III. Interestingly, a DNA damage response was observed at telomeres in telomestatin-treated cells. These data indicate the importance of G-quadruplex stabilization during telomere maintenance in ALT cells. The function of TRF2/Topo III/BLM in the resolution of replication intermediates at telomeres is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2016355879,"The phosphatidylinositol (PI) cycle mediates many cellular events by controlling the metabolism of many lipid second messengers. Diacylglycerol kinase epsilon (DGK epsilon) has an important role in this cycle. DGK epsilon is the only DGK isoform to show inhibition by its product phosphatidic acid (PA) as well as substrate specificity for sn-2 arachidonoyl-diacylglycerol (DAG). Here, we show that this inhibition and substrate specificity are both determined by selectivity for a combination of the sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains of PA or DAG, respectively, preferring the most prevalent acyl chain composition of lipids involved specifically in the PI cycle, 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl. Although the difference in rate for closely related lipid species is small, there is a significant enrichment of 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl PI because of the cyclical nature of PI turnover. We also show that the inhibition of DGK epsilon by PA is competitive and that the deletion of the hydrophobic segment and cationic cluster of DGK epsilon does not affect its selectivity for the acyl chains of PA or DAG. Thus, this active site not only recognizes the lipid headgroup but also a combination of the two acyl chains in PA or DAG. We propose a mechanism of DGK epsilon regulation where its dual acyl chain selectivity is used to negatively regulate its enzymatic activity in a manner that ensures DGK epsilon remains committed to the PI turnover cycle. This novel mechanism of enzyme regulation within a signaling pathway could serve as a template for the regulation of enzymes in other pathways in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2062420757,"DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) are lethal if not repaired and are highly mutagenic if misrepaired. Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is one of the major DSB repair pathways and can rejoin the DSB ends either precisely or with mistakes. Recent evidence suggests the existence of two NHEJ subpathways: conservative NHEJ (C-NHEJ), which does not require microhomology and can join ends precisely; and deletional NHEJ (D-NHEJ), which utilizes microhomology to join the ends with small deletions. Little is known about how these NHEJ subpathways are regulated. Mre11 has been implicated in DNA damage response, thus we investigated whether Mre11 function also extended to NHEJ. We utilized an intrachromosomal NHEJ substrate in which DSBs are generated by the I-SceI to address this question. The cohesive ends are fully complementary and were either repaired by C-NHEJ or D-NHEJ with similar efficiency. We found that disruption of Mre11 by RNA interference in human cells led to a 10-fold decrease in the frequency of D-NHEJ compared with cells with functional Mre11. Interestingly, C-NHEJ was not affected by Mre11 status. Expression of wild type but not exonuclease-defective Mre11 mutants was able to rescue D-NHEJ in Mre11-deficient cells. Further mutational analysis suggested that additional mechanisms associated with methylation of Mre11 at the C-terminal glycine–arginine-rich domain contributed to the promotion of D-NHEJ by Mre11.

Improper repair or failure to repair DSBs can lead to gene deletions, duplications, translocations, and missegregation of large chromosome fragments, which may result in gene dosage imbalance, cancer development, or cell death (1Hoeijmakers J.H.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Historically, two distinct pathways have been described which ensure that DSBs are repaired: nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). During HR, the damaged chromosome interacts via synapsis with an undamaged DNA molecule with which it shares extensive sequence homology, usually its sister chromatid (4Modesti M. Kanaar R.

HR is most active in the late S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. In contrast, NHEJ is active throughout the cell cycle and requires little or no DNA homology during repair; thus, it is traditionally considered an error-prone repair pathway (6Lieber M.R. Ma Y.

The alternative pathway for NHEJ is the highly mutagenic and deletional NHEJ (D-NHEJ), which results in short deletions after use of imperfect microhomology of about 1–10 bp at the repair junctions. D-NHEJ activity has been demonstrated in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, D-NHEJ is independent of Rad52, Rad1, or Ku80 but depends on Mre11 in yeast (13Ma J.L. Kim E.M.

However, the genetic determinants of this subpathway have not been well established in mammalian cells. Mre11 is the core subunit of the Mre11·Rad50·Nbs1 complex (called the MRN complex), which is conserved throughout all kingdoms of life. The MRN complex is a central player in most aspects of the cellular response to DSBs, including HR, NHEJ, telomere maintenance, and DNA damage checkpoints (15Varon R. Vissinga C. Platzer M.

After DNA damage, the MRN complex is recruited to the sites of damage via zinc hooks at the ends of the long, flexible arms of Rad50 (19Wiltzius J.J. Hohl M. Fleming J.C. Petrini J.H. Nat. Struct.

Mre11 contains both single-stranded DNA endonuclease and 3′-5′ exonuclease activities in vitro, but in vivo Mre11 is also implicated in 5′-3′ DSB resection. The MRN complex also interacts with BRCA1 and CtIP, which may be essential for DSB end resection to generate 3′ overhanging single-stranded DNA during initiation of HR (21Chen L. Nievera C.J.

Mre11 has an N-terminal nuclease domain, which contains five phosphoesterase motifs, and a C-terminal glycine–arginine-rich domain (GAR). Arthur et al. (23Arthur L.M. Gustausson K. Hopfner K.-P.

Complementation of ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder cells with this mutant, called Mre11-3, restored the localization of the MRN complex to DSBs in IR-induced foci (23Arthur L.M. Gustausson K.

Methylation of the GAR region has also been shown to be important for the DNA binding and exonuclease activity of Mre11 in vitro (25Déry U. Coulombe Y. Rodrigue A. Stasiak A. Richard S. Masson J.Y.

Both the crystal structure of yeast Mre11 and data from conditional knock-out mice (Mre11H129N/Δ) reveal that the nuclease activity of Mre11 is required for HR repair of DSBs (22Williams R.S.

However, whether Mre11 regulates both NHEJ subpathways or only D-NHEJ is controversial, and the mechanisms by which Mre11 is involved in NHEJ remain to be established. To address these questions, we have established a system that can analyze the accuracy and efficiency of rejoining of two adjacent DSB ends at chromosomal level in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. We show here that Mre11 siRNA knockdown in these cells results in significant reduction of the overall NHEJ efficiency. Upon sequencing the repair junctions, we found that Mre11 siRNA knockdown suppressed D-NHEJ by ∼10-fold, reflected by a reduction of small deletions in the repair junction, but it had no effect on the efficiency of C-NHEJ. Mutation of Mre11 in either the phosphoesterase domain (Mre11-3) or the GAR region (Mre11-R/A) to produce abnormal exonuclease activity impaired the D-NHEJ pathway only. The D-NHEJ deficiency is significantly more severe in cells with Mre11-R/A than that in cells with Mre11-3. Therefore, our data suggest that Mre11 is required specifically for D-NHEJ repair of DNA DSBs and that its exonuclease activity is at least one of the important mechanisms for this DNA end joining subpathway. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and glutamine. The NHEJ reporter plasmid pPHW1 was described previously (9Schulte-Uentrop L. El-Awady R.A. Schliecker L. Willers H. Dahm-Daphi J.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1663-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). pPHW1 was linearized with PvuI and transfected into HEK293 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Puromycin (5 μg/ml; Sigma) was added 48 h after transfection for selection. Southern blotting was performed to confirm that a single copy of pPHW1 was integrated at a single locus. This cell line (HEK293/pPHW1) was maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. To create DSB within the chromosomally integrated NHEJ substrate, meganuclease I-SceI was expressed in the HEK293/pPHW1 cells by transient transfection of the expression plasmid pCMV-I-SceI. Wild-type or mutant Mre11 cDNA was inserted into pcDNA3-Myc-HisC vector between the KpnI and NotI restriction sites, creating plasmids pcDNA3-Myc-Mre11-WT, pcDNA3-Myc-Mre11-R/A, and pcDNA3-Myc-Mre11-3. The Mre11-3 protein has a double mutation in its third phosphoesterase domain, specifically, His129-Asp130 was converted to Leu129-Val130. The Mre11-R/A protein has a R587A mutation in its GAR region (23Arthur L.M. Gustausson K. Hopfner K.-P. Carson C.T. Stracker T.H. Karcher A. Felton D. Weitzman M.D. Tainer J. Carney J.P.

Biol. 2008; 28: 3058-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Both mutant proteins lack exonuclease activity and showed resistance to Mre11 siRNA silencing. The sequences for Mre11 siRNA and scrambled control siRNA were as follows: Mre11 siRNA, 5′-GAACCUGGUCCCAGAGGAGdTdT-3′; and control siRNA, 5′-GGUUUGGCUGGGGUGUUAUdTdT-3′. The target for Mre11 siRNA oligonucleotides is located in the 5′-untranslated region of Mre11 mRNA, so the HEK293/pPHW1 cell line containing Mre11 cDNA (pcDNA3-Myc-Mre11-WT, Mre11-R/A, or Mre11-3) can be resistant to Mre11 siRNA silencing. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). Transfection of siRNA duplexes was carried out by Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Expression levels of Mre11 were measured at different time points after transfection by Western blotting. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-Mre11 (1:1000; Oncogene, Real Carpinteria, CA), rabbit anti-Myc (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse anti-actin (1:1000; Sigma). Proteins were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:5000; Santa Cruz, CA) followed by the use of an ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). For the quantitative NHEJ assay, the HEK293/pPHW1 cells were transfected with Mre11 siRNA or the scrambled control siRNA duplexes. The transfection was repeated after 24 h. After 72 h, the cells were transfected with pCMV-I-SceI or a control vector plasmid. pcDNA3.1 and pEGFP-N1 were used for mock and transfection efficiency controls, respectively. To allow for I-SceI expression and recombination to proceed, cells were grown for 24 h in nonselective medium. Cells were then replated at densities between 104 and 105 cells/100 cm2, and after 16 h of incubation the medium was changed to XHATM (xanthine, hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine, and mycophenolic acid at 10, 13.6, 0.17, 3.87, and 10 mg/ml respectively; Sigma). Cells were grown for another 2–3 weeks with medium exchanges twice a week. Control cells were grown in puromycin without XHATM. Clones containing more than 50 cells were scored. The NHEJ frequency was derived from the number of XHATM-resistant colonies/the number of cells seeded, corrected for transfection efficiency and plating efficiency. To analyze the molecular feature of the junction and the fidelity joined ends, transfection of siRNA and pCMV-I-SceI was performed as before. To allow recombination to proceed, cells were grown for 24 h in nonselective medium. Cells were then replated at densities of 100 cells/100 cm2. Cells were grown for another 2–3 weeks with either nonselective or selective medium containing XHATM. The genomic DNA was extracted. The types of NHEJ repair junctions after I-SceI cleavage were measured by PCR with primers flanking the two I-SceI sites. The primers were as follows: forward primer, 5′-TCTCCGCCCCATGGCTGACTA-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-CTGCATGGATCTGCAACATGTC-3′. The genomic DNA was PCR-amplified, The PCR products were either subjected to agarose electrophoresis or subcloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) for sequencing. The sequencing primers were as follows: forward primer, 5′-TCTCCGCCCCATGGCTGACT-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-AGATTAGCGACCGGAGATTG-3′. To quantify the C-NHEJ efficiency, the HEK293/pPHW1 cells were transfected with siRNA and I-SceI as before. Genomic DNA was extracted. Quantitative real-time PCRs were carried out with the TaqMan® Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Probe B was designed to amplify only the intact NHEJ substrate, and probe C was designed to amplify only the accurate religation (C-NHEJ) product. The probe B sequence was 5′-TATCCCTAGATCTGGCTGGGACACTTCACA-3′. The probe C sequence was 5′-TGCGCCCATTACCCTGTTATCCCTAGATCT-3′. Both sequences contain I-SceI cut sites. The primer sequences for the intact substrate were as follows: probe B forward, 5′-CCTACTCGAGCCATGGATTAC-3′; and probe B reverse, 5′-CCAGGTGACGATGTATTTTTCG-3′. The primer sequences for the religation substrate were as follows: probe C forward, 5′-GAGGCCTAGGCTTTTGCAAA-3′; and probe C reverse, 5′-TGTATTTTTCGCTCATGTGAAGTGT-3′. RNaseP probe was used for an internal control. For quantification of precise NHEJ repair products, we isolated a stable cell line designated RHW1, in which the I-SceI-induced DSBs was repaired by precise end joining event (C-NHEJ). The standard curve for the number of C-NHEJ events measured using real-time PCR was generated from series dilution of the genomic DNA from RHW1. The values for C-NHEJ repair events were obtained from the standard curve generated using genomic DNA from RHW1. D-NHEJ efficiency was calculated as follows: D-NHEJ = 100% − value of religation (probe C) − value of uncut (probe B). All probes were purchased from ABI (Applied Biosystems). The data were analyzed via two-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni post test using GraphPad Prism version 4.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.001). To investigate the mechanisms that control the accuracy of NHEJ-mediated DNA DSB repair in mammalian cells, we generated a cell line in which a single copy of the NHEJ substrate pPHW1 was stably integrated into the genome (HEK293/pPHW1 cells). The structure of the NHEJ substrate and the strategy to measure NHEJ were described previously (9Schulte-Uentrop L. El-Awady R.A. Schliecker L. Willers H. Dahm-Daphi J.

Briefly, an artificial ATG (ATGART)-driven proximal open reading frame (ORF) is dominant over the downstream gpt ORF, thereby preventing gpt translation. The two I-SceI sites, which are separated by 30 bases containing the first ATGART, are in the same orientation, creating fully complementary cohesive 3′-OH single-stranded ends of 4 bases upon double cleavage and loss (“pop-out”) of the intervening nucleotides, including ATGART. Rejoining of the double-stranded ends by either precise C-NHEJ or error-prone D-NHEJ will reconstitute translation of the gpt ORF, permitting cell survival under XHATM selection and detection of recombinants as colonies grown in XHATM selection medium. Alternatively, error-prone D-NHEJ at either of the single I-SceI sites can also disrupt ATGART, allowing again for selection of recombinants with XHATM. By contrast, precise religation at a single I-SceI site cannot be detected directly with XHATM selection using this system. To define the role of Mre11 in the NHEJ pathway, we first estimated the overall NHEJ frequency after Mre11 was knocked down with siRNAs in HEK293/pPHW1 cells. The expression of Mre11 was almost completely inhibited between 72 and 90 h after Mre11 siRNA transfection (Fig. 1B). Induction of DSBs was achieved through transfection of pCMV-I-SceI at 48 h after Mre11 knockdown. As indicated in Fig. 1B, siRNA knockdown did not affect I-SceI expression. When NHEJ occurs, the cells will survive and form colonies in XHATM medium. As shown in Fig. 1C, suppression of Mre11 protein expression resulted in more than 2-fold reduction of the overall NHEJ efficiency (1.28 × 10−2 in control siRNA versus 0.66 × 10−2 in Mre11 siRNA), which indicates that Mre11 is involved in the repair of DNA DSBs by NHEJ. However, it was not clear whether Mre11 status affected C-NHEJ, or D-NHEJ, or both. To characterize the repair product in repaired clones, we analyzed profiles of the repair junction by PCR with primers flanking the two I-SceI sites. To avoid selection bias, the colonies did not undergo XHATM selection for gpt expression. According to the DNA sequence surrounding the I-SceI sites in the HEK293/pPHW1 cell line, we categorized PCR products into four groups: (i) uncut or precise rejoining after I-SceI digestion at either of the single I-SceI cut sites or at both of the I-SceI cut sites, the PCR product is 247 bp; (ii) small deletion, we define small deletion as less than 30 bp that clones with the PCR fragments between 217 bp and 247 bp; (iii) large deletion, the PCR fragment is shorter than 217 bp; and (iv) insertion, the PCR fragment is longer than 247 bp. Representative profiles of PCR products are shown in Fig. 2A, and the distribution of the repair products is summarized in Fig. 2B. Without Mre11 silencing, 8 of 69 (12.0%) clones adapted small deletions, but in Mre11 knockdown cells, only 1 of 84 (1.2%) clones had a small deletion. Therefore, Mre11 siRNA knockdown suppressed D-NHEJ repair events compared with control siRNA clones by 10-fold (from 12% to 1.2%). Mre11 knockdown had no effect on insertions and large deletions (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that Mre11 mainly controls small deletions during NHEJ but has little role in either large deletions or insertion mutations during DNA damage repair. The electrophoresis of the PCR fragments by agarose gel did not allow us to define whether the distal ends were rejoined through precise relegation or via imprecise end joining with deletion/insertion of few base pairs. To define how Mre11 affects DNA rearrangement at the junction site and to determine whether Mre11 regulates both D-NHEJ and C-NHEJ, we analyzed the DNA sequences in the repaired products. Fifty-three repair junctions from control siRNA knockdown clones and 48 repair junctions from Mre11 siRNA knockdown clones were sequenced (Fig. 3A). In clones with control siRNA knockdown, 29 of 53 repair events (54.7%) were accurately religated, and 24 of 53 repair events (45.3%) were involved in microhomologies ranging from 1 to 10 nucleotides (Fig. 3B). In contrast, in clones with Mre11 knockdown, precise religation occurred in 40 of 48 clones (83.3%), whereas only 8 of 48 clones (16.7%) were repaired using microhomologies (Fig. 3B). Importantly, all rearrangements were restricted to the sequence around the I-SceI site, indicating that these mutations did not arise from the PCR or bacteria amplification steps, in which mutations should be distributed all along the sequenced DNA. Hence, as shown in Fig. 3C, the loss of Mre11 resulted in a shift in the molecular spectrum of end joining from comparable proportions of precise religation versus microhomology-mediated deletional end joining (54.7% versus 45.3%) in control siRNA-treated cells to predominantly precise religation and diminished deletional end joining using microhomology (83.3% versus 16.7%). Based on the molecular spectrum of the rejoined ends and the overall efficiency of end joining, we calculated the frequency of D-NHEJ and C-NHEJ. As shown in Fig. 3D, the frequency of D-NHEJ was significantly suppressed by 6.2-fold by siRNA-mediated Mre11 silencing (p < 0.01), whereas the frequency of C-NHEJ was not changed significantly by Mre11 silencing (p > 0.05) (Fig. 3D). Overall, these data indicate that Mre11 promotes D-NHEJ repair using microhomology but does not have a significant effect on C-NHEJ, which is consistent with previous data in yeast (13Ma J.L. Kim E.M. Haber J.E. Lee S.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8820-8828Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and the recent report from in human cells using similar approaches to assess the role of Mre11 in NHEJ subpathways (30Xie A. Kwok A. Scully R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In addition, a small percentage of rejoining involved the insertion events associated with deletion, which were not effected by Mre11 status.FIGURE 3Mre11 promotes deletional D-NHEJ but does not affect the level of precise C-NHEJ.

The presence of D-NHEJ is then derived from the difference between total NHEJ and C-NHEJ events. We first validated the sensitivity and specificity of quantitative real-time PCR as an alternative method in the assessment of the efficiency of C-NHEJ directly and D-NHEJ indirectly.

https://openalex.org/W2084262863,"Ligand-dependent corepressor LCoR was identified as a protein that interacts with the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) ligand binding domain in a hormone-dependent manner. LCoR also interacts directly with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and HDAC6. Notably, HDAC6 has emerged as a marker of breast cancer prognosis. However, although HDAC3 is nuclear, HDAC6 is cytoplasmic in many cells. We found that HDAC6 is partially nuclear in estrogen-responsive MCF7 cells, colocalizes with LCoR, represses transactivation of estrogen-inducible reporter genes, and augments corepression by LCoR. In contrast, no repression was observed upon HDAC6 expression in COS7 cells, where it is exclusively cytoplasmic. LCoR binds to HDAC6 in vitro via a central domain, and repression by LCoR mutants lacking this domain was attenuated. Kinetic chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed hormone-dependent recruitment of LCoR to promoters of ERalpha-induced target genes in synchrony with ERalpha. HDAC6 was also recruited to these promoters, and repeat chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the corecruitment of LCoR with ERalpha and with HDAC6. Remarkably, however, although we find evidence for corecruitment of LCoR and ERalpha on genes repressed by the receptor, LCoR and HDAC6 failed to coimmunoprecipitate, suggesting that they are part of distinct complexes on these genes. Although small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of LCoR or HDAC6 augmented expression of an estrogen-sensitive reporter gene in MCF7 cells, unexpectedly their ablation led to reduced expression of some endogenous estrogen target genes. Taken together, these data establish that HDAC6 can function as a cofactor of LCoR but suggest that they may act in enhance expressing some target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2001686756,"Background Inflammation followed by fibrosis is a component of islet dysfunction in both rodent and human type 2 diabetes. Because islet inflammation may originate from endothelial cells, we assessed the expression of selected genes involved in endothelial cell activation in islets from a spontaneous model of type 2 diabetes, the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat. We also examined islet endotheliuml/oxidative stress (OS)/inflammation-related gene expression, islet vascularization and fibrosis after treatment with the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). Methodology/Principal Findings Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR on islets isolated from 10-week-old diabetic GK and control Wistar rats. Furthermore, GK rats were treated s.c twice daily with IL-1Ra (Kineret, Amgen, 100 mg/kg/day) or saline, from 4 weeks of age onwards (onset of diabetes). Four weeks later, islet gene analysis and pancreas immunochemistry were performed. Thirty-two genes were selected encoding molecules involved in endothelial cell activation, particularly fibrinolysis, vascular tone, OS, angiogenesis and also inflammation. All genes except those encoding angiotensinogen and epoxide hydrolase (that were decreased), and 12-lipoxygenase and vascular endothelial growth factor (that showed no change), were significantly up-regulated in GK islets. After IL-1Ra treatment of GK rats in vivo, most selected genes implied in endothelium/OS/immune cells/fibrosis were significantly down-regulated. IL-1Ra also improved islet vascularization, reduced fibrosis and ameliorated glycemia. Conclusions/Significance GK rat islets have increased mRNA expression of markers of early islet endothelial cell activation, possibly triggered by several metabolic factors, and also some defense mechanisms. The beneficial effect of IL-1Ra on most islet endothelial/OS/immune cells/fibrosis parameters analyzed highlights a major endothelial-related role for IL-1 in GK islet alterations. Thus, metabolically-altered islet endothelium might affect the β-cell microenvironment and contribute to progressive type 2 diabetic β-cell dysfunction in GK rats. Counteracting islet endothelial cell inflammation might be one way to ameliorate/prevent β-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1996559493,"Smooth muscle cells play a major role in numerous vascular diseases that contribute to remodeling, repair after injury, and arteriogenesis, and the source of these cells is thought to lie within the vessel wall and the circulating blood. Currently, the precise origin and mechanism of differentiation of extravascular smooth muscle progenitor cells (SPCs) is unclear. We show here that the CX3CR1 mononuclear cell population of murine bone marrow provides a source of SPCs that contributes to smooth muscle cells within the neointimal plaque after vascular injury. Moreover, CX3CR1-fractal-kine (FKN) interaction in vivo is essential for smooth muscle cell differentiation of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells at the vessel wall level. Functional competence of bone marrow-derived CX3CR1 positive cells to interact with FKN is also crucial in part for neointima formation following vascular injury. Finally, in a pure preparation of bone marrow-derived CX3CR1 positive cells, we show that in vitro smooth muscle cell differentiation increases markedly in the presence of FKN. Our data highlight a novel functional relationship between the myeloid and vascular systems and in the context of vascular injury and repair underscores a key chemokine-receptor pathway that may regulate cell fate when smooth muscle cell differentiation is required.—Kumar, A.

https://openalex.org/W1970725022,"Tetherin (also known as BST2, CD317 or HM1.24) has recently been reported to inhibit a wide range of viruses. However, the antiviral mechanism of action of tetherin has not been determined. Both ends of the tetherin molecule are associated with the plasma membrane and it forms a homodimer. Therefore, a model in which progeny virions are retained on the cell surface by dimer formation between tetherin molecules on the viral envelope and plasma membrane has been proposed as the antiviral mechanism of action of this molecule. To investigate this possibility, we examined the correlation between dimerization and antiviral activity of tetherin in Lassa and Marburg virus-like particle production systems using tetherin mutants deficient in dimer formation. However, the tetherin mutant with complete loss of dimerization activity still showed apparent antiviral activity, indicating that dimerization of tetherin is not essential for its antiviral activity. This suggests that tetherin retains progeny virions on the cell surface by a mechanism other than dimerization."
https://openalex.org/W2090734335,"Integrated vector management for malaria control has received a lot of recent interest. Attacking multiple points in the transmission cycle is hoped to act synergistically and improve upon current single-tool interventions based on the use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs). In the present study, we theoretically examined the application of larval habitat source reduction with ITNs in reducing malaria transmission. We selected this type of environmental management to complement ITNs because of a potential secondary mode of action that both control strategies share. In addition to increasing vector mortality, ITNs reduce the rate at which female mosquitoes locate human hosts for blood feeding, thereby extending their gonotrophic cycle. Similarly, while reducing adult vector emergence and abundance, source reduction of larval habitats may prolong the cycle duration by extending delays in locating oviposition sites. We found, however, that source reduction of larval habitats only operates through this secondary mode of action when habitat density is below a critical threshold. Hence, we illustrate how this strategy becomes increasingly effective when larval habitats are limited. We also demonstrate that habitat source reduction is better suited to human populations of higher density and in the presence of insecticide resistance or when the insecticidal properties of ITNs are depleted."

Aimed to determine the role of GCS in tumor response to chemotherapy, a new mixed-backbone oligonucleotide (MBO-asGCS) with higher stability and efficiency has been generated to silence human GCS gene. MBO-asGCS was taken up efficiently in both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells, but it selectively suppressed GCS overexpression, and sensitized drug-resistant cells. MBO-asGCS increased doxorubicin sensitivity by 83-fold in human NCI/ADR-RES, and 43-fold in murine EMT6/AR1 breast cancer cells, respectively. In tumor-bearing mice, MBO-asGCS treatment dramatically inhibited the growth of multidrug-resistant NCI/ADR-RE tumors, decreasing tumor volume to 37%, as compared with scrambled control. Furthermore, MBO-asGCS sensitized multidrug-resistant tumors to chemotherapy, increasing doxorubicin efficiency greater than 2-fold. The sensitization effects of MBO-asGCS relied on the decreases of gene expression and enzyme activity of GCS, and on the increases of C18-ceramide and of caspase-executed apoptosis. MBO-asGCS was accumulation in tumor xenografts was greater in other tissues, excepting liver and kidneys; but MBO-asGCS did not exert significant toxic effects on liver and kidneys. This study, for the first time in vivo, has demonstrated that GCS is a promising therapeutic target for cancer drug resistance, and MBO-asGCS has the potential to be developed as an antineoplastic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2048817002,"Background Hematophagous insects digest large amounts of host hemoglobin and release heme inside their guts. In Rhodnius prolixus, hemoglobin-derived heme is detoxified by biomineralization, forming hemozoin (Hz). Recently, the involvement of the R. prolixus perimicrovillar membranes in Hz formation was demonstrated. Methodology/Principal Findings Hz formation activity of an α-glucosidase was investigated. Hz formation was inhibited by specific α-glucosidase inhibitors. Moreover, Hz formation was sensitive to inhibition by Diethypyrocarbonate, suggesting a critical role of histidine residues in enzyme activity. Additionally, a polyclonal antibody raised against a phytophagous insect α-glucosidase was able to inhibit Hz formation. The α-glucosidase inhibitors have had no effects when used 10 h after the start of reaction, suggesting that α-glucosidase should act in the nucleation step of Hz formation. Hz formation was seen to be dependent on the substrate-binding site of enzyme, in a way that maltose, an enzyme substrate, blocks such activity. dsRNA, constructed using the sequence of α-glucosidase gene, was injected into R. prolixus females' hemocoel. Gene silencing was accomplished by reduction of both α-glucosidase and Hz formation activities. Insects were fed on plasma or hemin-enriched plasma and gene expression and activity of α-glucosidase were higher in the plasma plus hemin-fed insects. The deduced amino acid sequence of α-glucosidase shows a high similarity to the insect α-glucosidases, with critical histidine and aspartic residues conserved among the enzymes. Conclusions/Significance Herein the Hz formation is shown to be associated to an α-glucosidase, the biochemical marker from Hemipteran perimicrovillar membranes. Usually, these enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bond. The results strongly suggest that α-glucosidase is responsible for Hz nucleation in the R. prolixus midgut, indicating that the plasticity of this enzyme may play an important role in conferring fitness to hemipteran hematophagy, for instance."
https://openalex.org/W2075336687,"Mitochondria are cellular organelles that perform critical metabolic functions: they generate energy from nutrients but also provide metabolites for de novo synthesis of fatty acids and several amino acids. Thus mitochondrial mass and activity must be coordinated with nutrient availability, yet this remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila larvae grown in low yeast food have strong defects in mitochondrial abundance and respiration activity in the larval fat body. This correlates with reduced expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, particularly genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Second, genes involved in glutamine metabolism are also expressed in a nutrient-dependent manner, suggesting a coordination of amino acid synthesis with mitochondrial abundance and activity. Moreover, we show that Delg (CG6338), the Drosophila homologue to the alpha subunit of mammalian transcription factor NRF-2/GABP, is required for proper expression of most genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Our data demonstrate that Delg is critical to adjust mitochondrial abundance in respect to Cyclin D/Cdk4, a growth-promoting complex and glutamine metabolism according to nutrient availability. However, in contrast to nutrients, Delg is not involved in the regulation of mitochondrial activity in the fat body. These findings are the first genetic evidence that the regulation of mitochondrial mass can be uncoupled from mitochondrial activity."

Here, we analyzed the function of these domains in coregulation of PR- and ERα-regulated gene expression. LCoR and CtBP1 colocalize in nuclear bodies that also contain CtBP-interacting protein CtIP and polycomb group repressor complex marker BMI1. Coexpression of CtBP1 in MCF7 or T47D breast cancer cells augmented corepression by LCoR, whereas coexpression of CtIP did not, consistent with direct interaction of LCoR with CtBP1, but not CtIP. The N-terminal region containing the PXDLS motifs is necessary and sufficient for CTBP1 recruitment and essential for full corepression.

Notably, screens designed to identify coactivators revealed that agonist-bound nuclear receptors also recruit proteins with corepressor properties, such as nuclear receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP140/NRIP1) (11White J.H.

We identified LCoR as a protein that interacted with the estrogen-bound ligand binding domain of ERα. Transiently expressed LCoR repressed hormone-dependent transactivation by a range of nuclear receptors. This included particularly efficacious repression of progesterone-stimulated transcription. LCoR transcripts are detectable as early as the two-cell stage of embryonic development, and the protein is robustly expressed in numerous fetal and adult tissues, including progesterone and estrogen target tissues such as breast, endometrium, and placenta (15Fernandes I.

LCoR acts as a scaffold for both histone deacetylases (HDACs) and C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) corepressors and functions by both HDAC-dependent and -independent mechanisms in a receptor-specific manner. For example, whereas the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A abolished LCoR-dependent corepression of estrogen-stimulated reporter gene expression, PR-stimulated expression was largely resistant to trichostatin A (15Fernandes I.

LCoR contains two adjacent sequences, (P/V)XLDLX(K/R) or (P/V)XLDLXXK, near its N terminus that correspond to extended PXDLS consensus motifs recognized by CtBPs (13Vo N. Fjeld C. Goodman R.H. Mol.

Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G.

Highly homologous CtBP2 was identified from EST databases (20Katsanis N. Fisher E.M. Genomics. 1998; 47: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Remarkably, CtBPs bind NAD(H) and are related to 2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases, and CtBP1 has weak dehydrogenase activity. In addition, dinucleotide binding stimulates protein oligomerization activity and corepression. CtBPs interact directly with several transcriptional coregulatory proteins, many of which share the PXDLS motifs described above (13Vo N. Fjeld C. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell.

Acta. 2006; 1765: 67-73PubMed Google Scholar), which also binds BRCA1 and retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) tumor suppressor proteins (23Meloni A.R. Smith E.J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Targeted ablation of CtBP1 or -2 expression in mice revealed that the two proteins play important and overlapping roles in mouse development (19Mani-Telang P. Arnosti D.N. Dev.

In addition to its N-terminal CtBP interaction motifs and a central HDAC binding domain (29Palijan A. Fernandes I. Bastien Y. Tang L. Verway M. Kourelis M. Tavera-Mendoza L.E. Li Z. Bourdeau V. Mader S. Yang X.J. White J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30264-30274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), LCoR contains a C-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain that is homologous to motifs encoded by the Eip93F (CG18389 gene product from transcript CG18389-Rb) and MBLK-1 genes of Drosophila and Honeybee (Apis mellifera) (30Takeuchi H. Kage E. Sawata M. Kamikouchi A. Ohashi K. Ohara M. Fujiyuki T. Kunieda T. Sekimizu K. Natori S. Kubo T. Insect Mol. Biol. 2001; 10: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), respectively. The LCoR HTH domain also bears 35% homology to pipsqueak motifs (PSQ). PSQ motifs are repeated four times in the DNA binding region of the Drosophila pipsqueak transcription factor, which plays a role in gene silencing (31Lehmann M. Siegmund T. Lintermann K.G. Korge G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28504-28509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Multiple repeats of the domain are required for PSQ DNA binding (31Lehmann M. Siegmund T. Lintermann K.G. Korge G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28504-28509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and mutation of one of the two HTH motifs in the MBLK-1 gene strongly reduced site-specific DNA binding (30Takeuchi H. Kage E. Sawata M. Kamikouchi A. Ohashi K. Ohara M. Fujiyuki T. Kunieda T. Sekimizu K. Natori S. Kubo T. Insect Mol. Biol. 2001; 10: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The PSQ domain is homologous to unique motifs found in a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins that interact with DNA, such as recombinases (31Lehmann M. Siegmund T. Lintermann K.G. Korge G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28504-28509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Siegmund T. Lehmann M. Dev. Genes Evol. 2002; 212: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that LCoR itself may interact with DNA. Other studies have shown that HTH domains can function in protein-protein interactions, where the HTH motif, combined with other domains, can induce formation of multisubunit complexes (33Aravind L. Anantharaman V. Balaji S. Babu M.M. Iyer L.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 231-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such proteins with multidomains can act as scaffolds between the basal transcription machinery and transcription factors (33Aravind L. Anantharaman V. Balaji S. Babu M.M. Iyer L.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 231-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The accompanying paper showed that LCoR recruits HDAC6 through a central domain (29Palijan A. Fernandes I. Bastien Y. Tang L. Verway M.

In this study we have analyzed the roles of domains controlling recruitment of CtBPs and the C-terminal HTH motif in corepression by LCoR. We were primarily interested in determining the roles of these domains in corepression of the PR, as our previous work showed that the efficacious corepression of PR-driven gene reporter gene expression by LCoR appeared to be largely insensitive to HDAC inhibition (15Fernandes I. Bastien Y. Wai T. Nygard K. Lin R. Cormier O. Lee H.S. Eng F. Bertos N.R. Pelletier N. Mader S. Han V.K. Yang X.J. White J.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 139-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We find that both the PXDLS motifs and the HTH domain are required for corepression of both the PR and ERα, as disruption of either region markedly attenuated LCoR function. LCoR colocalizes with CtBP1 and CtIP in nuclear foci, and CtBP1 is corecruited with LCoR to PR and ERα target genes in a hormone-dependent manner. Ablation of LCoR and/or CtBP1 enhanced progesterone-stimulated gene expression in T47D breast cancer cells. In contrast, loss of LCoR or CtBP1 had gene-specific effects on ERα-regulated genes and generally led to reduced target gene expression. A rabbit polyclonal antipeptide antibody was raised against LCoR amino acids 20–36 (QDPSQPNSTKNQSLPKA) fused to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and purified over a peptide affinity column (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX).

Cy3-donkey polyclonal α-goat (705-165-147) and Cy2-goat polyclonal α-rabbit (711-225-152), Cy3-donkey polyclonal α-rabbit (711-165-152), and Cy2-donkey polyclonal α-mouse (715-225-150) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Mouse monoclonal α-FLAG M2 (F3165) and α-FLAG M2 horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugate (A-8592), monoclonal α-rabbit HRP conjugate (A2074), and rabbit polyclonal α-goat HRP conjugate (A5420) were from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal CtBP1 (07-306) was purchased from Millipore (Temecula, CA). Rabbit polyclonal LCoR (18-003-44018) was purchased from GenWay Biotech (San Diego, CA). Rabbit polyclonal PR (ab68195) and rabbit polyclonal CtIP (ab70163) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). PSG5/LCoR, FLAG-LCoR/pcDNA3.1 and LCoR derivatives mutagenized in the CtBP binding motifs, PLDLTVR (LCoR amino acids 64–70; m1) and VLDLSTK (LCoR amino acids 82–88; m2), and the double mutant (m1m2) have been described (3Wong C.W.

FLAG-LCoRΔHTH/pcDNA3.1 was made using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene 200518, La Jolla, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Primers were designed to delete amino acids 350–395 from LCoR. The new construct was sequenced to confirm proper deletion LCoR. All cells were cultured under the recommended conditions. For immunocytochemistry, MCF7 cells grown on collagen IV-treated microscope slides in 6-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were prepared for immunocytochemistry as described below. For immunoprecipitation of tagged proteins, MCF7 cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 10 μl of Lipofectamine containing 10 μg of pSG5 vectors containing FLAG-LCoR, FLAG-m1, FLAG-m2, or FLAG-m1 + m2. For analysis of the effects of CtBP1 and CtIP on LCoR corepression, MCF7 cells (60–70% confluent) were grown in DMEM without phenol red supplemented with 10% FBS on 6-well plates. Cells were transfected in medium without serum (Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The amounts of expression vectors were as follows: 100 ng of ERα or human PR expression vectors (as indicated), 100 ng of LCoR/pcDNA3.1, 250 ng of ERE3-TATA/pXP2 or pGRE5/pXP2 reporter plasmid, 250 ng of internal control vector pCMV-βgal. Quantities of expression vectors used are indicated in the legends to Figs. 3 and 5. The medium was replaced 18 h after transfection by a medium containing charcoal-stripped serum and ligand (10 nm) for 30 h as indicated. For the Luciferase reporter assay, cells were harvested in 250 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega).FIGURE 5The HTH domain of LCoR is essential for corepression. A, shown are schematic representations of full-length LCoR (upper panel) and a deletion mutant lacking the HTH domain (lower panel; LCoRΔHTH) in which amino acids 350–395 were deleted, leaving the C-terminal portion of the protein (395–433 amino acids) intact.

The upper panel shows a schematic view of IGFBP1 promoter. PRE, progesterone response element. D and E, deletion of HTH domain of LCoR abolishes corepressor function is shown. Dose-response curves were performed analyzing corepression in the presence of increasing amounts of LCoR or LCoRΔHTH expression vectors (0, 100, 400, and 600 ng, as indicated). T47D cells were treated with P4 (10 nm; panel D) and MCF7 cells were treated with E2 (10 nm; panel E). Cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors of either PR (100 ng) or ERα (100 ng) and their corresponding reporter plasmid (250 ng) for 18 h.

MCF7 cells were then incubated with α-LCoR (1:500) and goat polyclonal antibodies against CtBP1, CtIP, or Bmi1 (1:50) in buffer B (0.2% Triton X-100, 5% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed (3×) with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with goat anti-rabbit-Cy2 and donkey anti-goat Cy3 (1:300) in buffer B for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were mounted with Immuno-Fluore Mounting Medium (ICN, Aurora, Ohio) and visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous CtBP, CtIP, or Bmi1, MCF7 cells in 150-mm dishes were lysed for 3 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of LB (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, protease inhibitor mixture). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 5 min), and proteins were immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of αCtBP or αCtIP or polyclonal rabbit αBMI1 or control rabbit or goat IgG at 4 °C overnight followed by 2 h of incubation at 4 °C with protein A-agarose (for αCtBP, αBmi1, control rabbit IgG) or protein A+G-agarose (for αCtIP or control goat IgG). Beads were washed (3×) with LB. Bound immunocomplexes were boiled in Laemmli buffer, separated by 10% SDS/PAGE, blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with α-LCoR (1/1000), α-CtBP1, α-CtBP2, α-CtIP, or α-BMI1 (1:100), and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For immunoprecipitation of tagged proteins, transfected MCF7 cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of LB, 48 h after transfection. Supernatants were cleared and incubated overnight with 4 μg of αCtBP or α-FLAG M2 antibody followed by a 2-h incubation with protein A-agarose or protein A+G-agarose beads, respectively. Beads were washed (3×) with LB and Western-blotted as above. Dilutions of specific antibodies used for Western blotting were α-CtBP1 (1:100) and α-FLAG M2-peroxidase (1:100). A Western blot was performed as previously described (34Tavera-Mendoza L.E. Quach T.D. Dabbas B. Hudon J. Liao X. Palijan A. Gleason J.L. White J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cells were grown in 10-cm dishes (70% confluent) and transiently transfected with 500 ng of FLAG-tagged full-length of mutated LCoR. Cells were harvested 30 h later. ChIP and reChIP assays were performed as previously described (35Tavera-Mendoza L. Wang T.T. Lallemant B. Zhang R. Nagai Y. Bourdeau V. Ramirez-Calderon M. Desbarats J. Mader S. White J.H.

Cells were grown in 10-cm dishes (70% confluent) and transiently transfected with 500 ng of FLAG-tagged LCoR (or FLAG-tagged LCoRΔHTH as indicated). After transfection, cells were starved for 2 days in DMEM-phenol free and FBS-free media and treated with 2.5 μm α-amanitin (Sigma, A2263) for 2 h before hormone treatment to properly synchronize cells. Cells were collected, and cofactor recruitment was evaluated on promoter regions containing either estrogen or progesterone response element (as indicated) of target genes. For ChIP primers sequences, please refer to supplemental Table 1. siRNAs were purchased from Thermo Scientific Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The following ON-TARGETplus SMART pool siRNAs were used: LCoR (L-026303-00), CtBP1 (L-008609-00), CyPB (D-001820-10), and non-targeting (D-001818-10). siRNAs were resuspended per the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections were done in 6-well plates as described previously. Lipofectamine 2000 (10 μl) was used as the transfection reagent. DMEM phenol-free with 10% stripped FBS was added 12 h after transfection. For Western blot analysis, cells were collected 48 h after transfection. Luciferase reporter assays after siRNA knockdowns were performed as follows. 100 ng of ERα expression vector and 250 ng of ERE3-TATA-pXP2 vector were transfected with the corresponding siRNA. DMEM phenol-free with 10% stripped FBS was added 12 h after transfection. Ligand was added 36 h after transfection, and cells were collected 24 h later. Luciferase activity was measured as previously described. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes. Media were replaced with charcoal-stripped medium-containing ligand. Total RNA was extracted with TRIZOL reagent. cDNA synthesis was performed with iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The MiniOpticon real-time PCR system with the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) was used for qRT-PCR expression analysis of target genes. The program used was as follows: 1) incubation at 94 °C for 60 s, 2) incubation at 95 °C for 20 s, 3) incubation at 60 °C for 30 s (decreasing temperature by 1° per cycle), 4) incubation at 72 °C for 30 s, 5) plate reading, 6) repetition from step 2 five more times, 7) incubation at 95 °C for 20 s, 8) incubation at 57.5 °C for 30 s, 9) incubation at 72 °C for 30 s, 10) plate reading, 11) repetition from step 7 thirty-five more times, 12) performance of melting curve and end. Results were normalized to β-actin mRNA expression. For qRT-PCR primers sequences, please refer to supplemental Table 2. Colocalization of LCoR with CtBP1 in MCF7 cells was confirmed by immunocytochemical analyses (Fig. 1A). Both proteins were broadly distributed in the nucleus and were also concentrated in discrete nuclear bodies. A similar colocalization of CtBP2 and LCoR was also observed (data not shown). Given the extensive overlap of CtBPs and LCoR, we determined whether LCoR colocalized with CtIP, which was identified as a CtBP-interacting protein containing an extended PXDLS motif (22Chinnadurai G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1765: 67-73PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to results obtained with CtBP, CtIP and LCoR showed strongly overlapping patterns of expression concentrated in discrete nuclear bodies (Fig. 1B). In addition, endogenous LCoR coimmunoprecipitates with antibodies directed against either CtBPs or CtIP (Fig. 1C). Other studies have shown that CtIP interacts directly with the retinoblastoma gene product (22Chinnadurai G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1765: 67-73PubMed Google Scholar) and link CtBP1 and Rb to polycomb group repressor complexes (26Sewalt R.G. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell.

PRC1 complexes form large foci containing numerous factors, including BMI1 polycomb ring finger oncogene (BMI1), visible as discrete nuclear structures (37Ren X. Vincenz C. Kerppola T.K. Mol. Cell.

Taken together, these studies show that LCoR extensively colocalizes with CtBP1 and CtIP in the nucleus, including in PRC1 complexes. The specificity of the interactions of LCoR with CtBP1 were further analyzed in vitro using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to a series of C-terminal deletion mutants of LCoR or LCoR mutant m1m2, which lacks the tandem PXDLS motifs (Fig. 2A).

https://openalex.org/W2008981958,"The study of coordinated activity in neuronal circuits has been challenging without a method to simultaneously report activity and connectivity. Here we present the first use of pseudorabies virus (PRV), which spreads through synaptically connected neurons, to express a fluorescent calcium indicator protein and monitor neuronal activity in a living animal. Fluorescence signals were proportional to action potential number and could reliably detect single action potentials in vitro. With two-photon imaging in vivo, we observed both spontaneous and stimulated activity in neurons of infected murine peripheral autonomic submandibular ganglia (SMG). We optically recorded the SMG response in the salivary circuit to direct electrical stimulation of the presynaptic axons and to physiologically relevant sensory stimulation of the oral cavity. During a time window of 48 hours after inoculation, few spontaneous transients occurred. By 72 hours, we identified more frequent and prolonged spontaneous calcium transients, suggestive of neuronal or tissue responses to infection that influence calcium signaling. Our work establishes in vivo investigation of physiological neuronal circuit activity and subsequent effects of infection with single cell resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2049466713,"Membrane transporters play crucial roles in the cellular uptake and efflux of an array of small molecules including nutrients, environmental toxins, and many clinically used drugs. We hypothesized that common genetic variation in the proximal promoter regions of transporter genes contribute to observed variation in drug response. A total of 579 polymorphisms were identified in the proximal promoters (-250 to +50 bp) and flanking 5' sequence of 107 transporters in the ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) and Solute Carrier (SLC) superfamilies in 272 DNA samples from ethnically diverse populations. Many transporter promoters contained multiple common polymorphisms. Using a sliding window analysis, we observed that, on average, nucleotide diversity (pi) was lowest at approximately 300 bp upstream of the transcription start site, suggesting that this region may harbor important functional elements. The proximal promoters of transporters that were highly expressed in the liver had greater nucleotide diversity than those that were highly expressed in the kidney consistent with greater negative selective pressure on the promoters of kidney transporters. Twenty-one promoters were evaluated for activity using reporter assays. Greater nucleotide diversity was observed in promoters with strong activity compared to promoters with weak activity, suggesting that weak promoters are under more negative selective pressure than promoters with high activity. Collectively, these results suggest that the proximal promoter region of membrane transporters is rich in variation and that variants in these regions may play a role in interindividual variation in drug disposition and response."
https://openalex.org/W2163099364,"Background An accurate estimate of the total number of cases and severity of illness of an emerging infectious disease is required both to define the burden of the epidemic and to determine the severity of disease. When a novel pathogen first appears, affected individuals with severe symptoms are more likely to be diagnosed. Accordingly, the total number of cases will be underestimated and disease severity overestimated. This problem is manifest in the current epidemic of novel influenza A/H1N1. Methods and Results We used a simple approach to leverage measures of incident influenza A/H1N1 among a relatively small and well observed group of US, UK, Spanish and Canadian travelers who had visited Mexico to estimate the incidence among a much larger and less well surveyed population of Mexican residents. We estimate that a minimum of 113,000 to 375,000 cases of novel influenza A/H1N1 have occurred in Mexicans during the month of April, 2009. Such an estimate serves as a lower bound because it does not account for underreporting of cases in travelers or for nonrandom mixing between Mexican residents and visitors, which together could increase the estimates by more than an order of magnitude. Conclusions We find that the number of cases in Mexican residents may exceed the number of confirmed cases by two to three orders of magnitude. While the extent of disease spread is greater than previously appreciated, our estimate suggests that severe disease is uncommon since the total number of cases is likely to be much larger than those of confirmed cases."
https://openalex.org/W1989635442,"The post-translational import of nucleus-encoded preproteins into chloroplasts occurs through multimeric translocons in the outer (Toc) and inner (Tic) membranes. The high fidelity of the protein import process is maintained by specific recognition of the transit peptide of preproteins by the coordinate activities of two homologous GTPase Toc receptors, Toc34 and Toc159. Structural and biochemical studies suggest that dimerization of the Toc receptors functions as a component of the mechanism to control access of preproteins to the membrane translocation channel of the translocon. We show that specific mutations that disrupted receptor dimerization in vitro reduced the rate of protein import in transgenic Arabidopsis compared with the wild type receptor. The mutations did not affect the GTPase activities of the receptors. Interestingly, these mutations did not decrease the initial preprotein binding at the receptors, but they reduced the efficiency of the transition from preprotein binding to membrane translocation. These data indicate that dimerization of receptors has a direct role in protein import and support a hypothesis in which receptor-receptor interactions participate in the initiation of membrane translocation of chloroplast preproteins as part of the molecular mechanism of GTP-regulated protein import."
https://openalex.org/W2013666169,"The stalling of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at the promoters of many genes, including developmental regulators, stress-responsive genes, and HIVLTR, suggests transcription elongation as a critical regulatory step in addition to initiation. Spt5, the large subunit of the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), represses or activates RNAPII elongation in vitro. How RNAPII elongation is repressed in vivo is not well understood. Here we report that CTR1 and CTR2CT, the two repeat-containing regions constituting the C-terminus of Spt5, play a redundant role in repressing RNAPII elongation in vivo. First, mis-expression of Spt5 lacking CTR1 or CTR2CT is inconsequential, but mis-expression of Spt5 lacking the entire C-terminus (termed NSpt5) dominantly impairs embryogenesis in zebrafish. Second, NSpt5 de-represses the transcription of hsp70-4 in zebrafish embryos and HIVLTR in cultured human cells, which are repressed at the RNAPII elongation step under non-inducible conditions. Third, NSpt5 directly associates with hsp70-4 chromatin in vivo and increases the occupancy of RNAPII, positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation (H3K4Me3), and surprisingly, the negative elongation factor A (NELF-A) at the locus, indicating a direct action of NSpt5 on the elongation repressed locus. Together, these results reveal a dominant activity of NSpt5 to de-repress RNAPII elongation, and suggest that the C-terminus of Spt5 is critical for repressing RNAPII elongation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1974032249,"The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit (RPB1) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP-II) is essential for gene expression in metazoa and yeast. The canonical CTD is characterized by heptapeptide repeats. Differential phosphorylation of canonical CTD orchestrates transcriptional and co-transcriptional maturation of mRNA and snRNA. Many organisms, including trypanosomes, lack a canonical CTD. In these organisms, the CTD is called a non-canonical CTD or pseudo-CTD (ΨCTD. In the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, the ΨCTD is ∼285 amino acids long, rich in serines and prolines, and phosphorylated. We report that T. brucei RNAP-II lacking the entire ΨCTD or containing only a 95-amino-acid-long ΨCTD failed to support cell viability. In contrast, RNAP-II with a 186-amino-acid-long ΨCTD maintained cellular growth. RNAP-II with ΨCTD truncations resulted in abortive initiation of transcription. These data establish that non-canonical CTDs play an important role in gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2046942081,"Focal arboviral infections affecting a subset of the overall population present an often overlooked set of challenges in the assessment and reporting of risk and the detection of spatial patterns. Our objective was to assess the variation in risk when using different at-risk populations and geographic scales for the calculation of incidence risk and the detection of geographic hot-spots of infection. We explored these variations using a pediatric arbovirus, La Crosse virus (LACV), as our model.Descriptive and cluster analyses were performed on probable and confirmed cases of LACV infections reported to the Tennessee Department of Health from 1997 to 2006, using three at-risk populations (the total population, the population 18 years and younger, and the population 15 years and younger) and at two geographic levels (county and census tract) to assess the variation in incidence risk and to investigate evidence of clustering using both global and local spatial statistics. We determined that the most appropriate at-risk population to calculate incidence risk and to assess the evidence of clustering was the population 15 years and younger. Based on our findings, the most appropriate geographical level to conduct spatial analyses and report incidence risk is the census tract level. The incidence risk in the population 15 years and younger at the county level ranged from 0 to 226.5 per 100,000 persons (median 41.5) in those counties reporting cases (n = 14) and at the census tract level it ranged from 50.9 to 673.9 per 100,000 persons (median 126.7) in those census tracts reporting cases (n = 51). To our knowledge, this is the highest reported incidence risk for this population at the county level for Tennessee and at the census tract level nationally.The results of this study indicate the possibility of missing disease clusters resulting from performing incidence risk investigations of focal diseases using inappropriate at-risk populations and/or at large geographic scales. Improved disease surveillance and health planning will result through the use of well defined at-risk populations and the use of appropriate geographic scales for the analysis and reporting of diseases. The finding of a high incidence risk of LACV infections in eastern Tennessee demonstrates that the vast majority of these infections continue to be under-diagnosed and/or underreported in this region. Persistent prevention and surveillance efforts will be required to reduce exposure to infectious vectors and to detect new cases of infection in this region. Application of this study's observations in future investigations will enhance the quantification of incidence risk and the identification of high-risk groups within the population."

https://openalex.org/W2134879715,"Activator protein 2 alpha (AP-2alpha) is involved in a variety of physiological processes. Increased AP-2alpha expression correlates with progression in various squamous cell carcinomas, and a recent publication found AP-2alpha to be overexpressed in approximately 70% of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) patient samples. It was found to repress transcription of the tumor suppressor gene C/CAAT Enhancer Binding Protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), and its binding site correlated with upstream methylation of the C/EBPalpha promoter. Therefore, we investigated the potential for AP-2alpha to target methylation to additional genes that would be relevant to HNSCC pathogenesis.Stable downregulation of AP-2alpha stable by shRNA in HNSCC cell lines correlated with decreased methylation of its target genes' regulatory regions. Furthermore, methylation of MLH1 in HNSCC with and without AP-2alpha downregulation revealed a correlation with microsatellite instability (MSI). ChIP analysis was used to confirm binding of AP-2alpha and HDAC1/2 to the targets. The effects of HDAC inhibition was assessed using Trichostatin A in a HNSCC cell line, which revealed that AP-2alpha targets methylation through HDAC recruitment.These findings are significant because they suggest AP-2alpha plays a role not only in epigenetic silencing, but also in genomic instability. This intensifies the potential level of regulation AP-2alpha has through transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, these findings have the potential to revolutionize the field of HNSCC therapy, and more generally the field of epigenetic therapy, by targeting a single gene that is involved in the malignant transformation via disrupting DNA repair and cell cycle control."
https://openalex.org/W2058578736,"Background ET-743 (trabectedin, Yondelis®) and PM00104 (Zalypsis®) are marine derived compounds that have antitumor activity. ET-743 and PM00104 exposure over sustained periods of treatment will result in the development of drug resistance, but the mechanisms which lead to resistance are not yet understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Human chondrosarcoma cell lines resistant to ET-743 (CS-1/ER) or PM00104 (CS-1/PR) were established in this study. The CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR exhibited cross resistance to cisplatin and methotrexate but not to doxorubicin. Human Affymetrix Gene Chip arrays were used to examine relative gene expression in these cell lines. We found that a large number of genes have altered expression levels in CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR when compared to the parental cell line. 595 CS-1/ER and 498 CS-1/PR genes were identified as overexpressing; 856 CS-1/ER and 874 CS-1/PR transcripts were identified as underexpressing. Three zinc finger protein (ZNF) genes were on the top 10 overexpressed genes list. These genes have not been previously associated with drug resistance in tumor cells. Differential expressions of ZNF93 and ZNF43 genes were confirmed in both CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR resistant cell lines by real-time RT-PCR. ZNF93 was overexpressed in two ET-743 resistant Ewing sarcoma cell lines as well as in a cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cell line, but was not overexpressed in paclitaxel resistant cell lines. ZNF93 knockdown by siRNA in CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR caused increased sensitivity for ET-743, PM00104, and cisplatin. Furthermore, ZNF93 transfected CS-1 cells are relatively resistant to ET-743, PM00104 and cisplatin. Conclusions/Significance This study suggests that zinc finger proteins, and ZNF93 in particular, are involved in resistance to ET-743 and PM00104."

Women initiating HAART after pregnancy were more likely to receive triple-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Multivariable analyses adjusted for baseline CD4+ lymphocytes, baseline HIV-1 RNA, age, race, CD4+ lymphocyte count nadir, history of ADE, prior use of non-HAART ART, type of HAART regimen, prior pregnancies, and date of HAART start. In these models, women initiating HAART during pregnancy had better 6-month HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ changes than those initiating HAART after pregnancy (-0.35 vs. 0.10 log(10) copies/mL, P = 0.03 and 183.8 vs. -70.8 cells/mm(3), P = 0.03, respectively) but similar to those initiating HAART before pregnancy (-0.32 log(10) copies/mL, P = 0.96 and 155.8 cells/mm(3), P = 0.81, respectively). There were 3 (25%) AIDS-defining events or deaths in women initiating HAART before pregnancy, 3 (4%) in those initiating HAART during pregnancy, and 5 (17%) in those initiating after pregnancy (P = 0.01). There were no statistical differences in rates of HIV disease progression between groups.HAART initiation during pregnancy was associated with better immunologic and virologic responses than initiation after pregnancy."

The recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli, and when purified at high concentration, NarE is a distinctive golden brown in color. Evidence from UV-visible spectrophotometry and EPR spectroscopy revealed characteristics consistent of an iron-binding protein.

To identify the amino acids involved in binding iron, a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and UV-visible and enzymatic assays were performed. All four cysteine residues were individually replaced by serine. Substitution of Cys67 and Cys128 into serine caused a drastic reduction in the E420/E280 ratio, suggesting that these two residues are essential for the formation of a stable coordination. This modification led to a consistent loss in ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, while decrease in NAD-glycohydrolase activity was less dramatic in these mutants, indicating that the correct assembly of the iron-binding site is essential for transferase but not hydrolase activity.

This observation may unravel novel functions exerted by this class of enzymes. Mono-ADP-ribosylation is a covalent and enzyme-catalyzed reaction in which β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), beyond its role in energy metabolism, acts as substrate. Mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases split the N-glycosidic bond of NAD+ to yield ADP-ribose moiety, which is selectively linked to specific amino acids in their protein targets, and nicotinamide, which is simultaneously released into the medium (1.Ueda K. Hayaishi O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 73-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Among the several toxins used by pathogenic bacteria to target and kill their host cells, proteins that exert ADP-ribosylation activity represent a large family of dangerous and potentially lethal toxins that interfere with cellular, metabolic, and regulatory pathways (2.Moss J. Vaughan M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 303-379PubMed Google Scholar). Many bacteria (e.g. Corinebacterium diphteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Bordetella pertussis, Salmonella enterica, Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) that pose significant human health threats (e.g. diphtheria, cholera, whooping cough, and severe diaorrhea) utilize ADP-ribosylating toxins to block protein synthesis, to alter signal transduction, or to modify cytoskeletal functions. All the effects that these enzymes produce are mediated by ADP-ribosylation of key target proteins such as elongation factor-2 (3.Honjo T. Nishizuka Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

The importance of a solid and robust catalytic activity in the onset of the diseases caused by ADP-ribosylating toxins prompted us to elucidate the structural and catalytic characteristics of NarE. Since NarE contains a Cys-X-Cys motif, which confers iron sensitivity, an attractive hypothesis was that NarE was capable of binding iron. Here, we used a combination of biophysical methods (UV spectra and EPR) to show that NarE contains an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) center with structural features resembling those present in the rubredoxin protein family (15.Chen C.J. Lin Y.H. Huang Y.C. Liu M.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 349: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fe-S clusters are typically bound to proteins via four cysteines. Therefore, to identify the iron ligands in NarE and investigate the biochemical effects of their substitutions, we generated a series of mutants in which the four cysteines, iron putative ligands (Cys11, Cys67, Cys128, and Cys130), were individually replaced by serine. Effects of serine substitution on Fe-S cluster stability were assessed by comparing spectroscopic properties and catalytic activities of wild-type protein with molecular variants. The results reported here indicate that Cys67 and Cys128 are important for maintaining a coordinated iron center.

Molecular masses were estimated from calibration standards included on each gel. ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was measured using standard assay (16.Moss J. Stanley S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 4809-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in a final volume of 0.3 ml, containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 20 mm agmatine as ADP-ribose acceptor and 0.1 mm [adenine-U-14C]NAD (0.05 μCi). After incubation at 30 °C, duplicate samples (100 μl) were applied to 1 ml columns of Dowex AG1-X2. [adenine-14C]ADP-ribosylagmatine was eluted for liquid scintillation counting with 5 ml of H2O. Alternatively, ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was assayed using a filter plate-based assay (17.Balducci E. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 344: 278-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Assays were performed as above in 0.3 ml total volume with 0.6 mg of poly-arginine replacing agmatine as an ADP-ribose acceptor. After incubation at 30 °C, samples were precipitated with 0.3 ml of 50% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, left for 30 min on ice, and applied in quadruplicate (100 μl) under vacuum conditions to each well of a mixed cellulose esters filter plate. The unreacted [adenine-U-14C]NAD was washed out with 10 volumes of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured in a Packard Top counter. An analog assay based on nicotinamide release was employed to measure the NADase activity of NarE (18.Moss J. Manganiello V.C. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 4424-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This assay was carried out in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm [carbonyl-14C]NAD (0.05 μCi) replacing [adenine-U-14C]NAD in a total volume of 0.3 ml. Samples (100 μl) after incubation at 30 °C were applied to a 1-ml column of Dowex AG1-X2 and 14C-nicotinamide eluted with 5 ml of H2O for liquid scintillation counting. Concentration of wild-type NarE iron content was determined colorimetrically using ferrozine under reducing conditions as described (19.Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). To completely release the complexed iron, samples were incubated 2 h at 60 °C in 2.25% KMnO4 and 0.6 n HCl. After a second reducing step at room temperature for 30 min, absorbances of samples were measured at 562 nm in a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The iron content was also measured by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer with a Varian 820-MS ICP mass spectrometer. To mutate amino acid residues of NarE, a PCR-based method was used. Oligonucleotides indicated below carrying a single nucleotide mismatch in the underlined positions were used to generate the mutants: C11S, AGAGGCATTAGTTCCCACAAGATAG; C67S, TCTATATGACGGATCTTATATATCTACA; C128S, AGCTGAAGATTCTGGCTGGCTGTATTCCTGAAG; and C130S, AGCTGAAGATTGTGGCTCTATTCCTGG. After mutagenesis and DNA sequencing, all of the generated mutants were cloned into pET21b+, expressed, and purified following the procedure described previously. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy of purified recombinant NarE was carried out at room temperature using a Lambda 2 Ultraspec spectrophotometer. Continuous wave X-band (9.4 GHz) EPR spectra were obtained using a spectrometer Bruker E500 Elexsys Series using the Bruker ER4122 SHQE cavity and an Oxford helium continuous flow cryostat (ESR900) system. EPR signals of the Fe-S center at X-band consist of three parts, one for each of the Kramers doublets. If the magnetic field is not too large compared with the energy separation between the Kramers doublets, each of these three parts may be described by a set of three effective g values. The lowest Kramers doublet gives rise to a signal starting at approximately geff = 9. The second Kramers doublet consists of a complex pattern centered near geff = 4.3. The third signal arising from the highest Kramers doublet is similar to that arising from the lowest and is not usually observed independently of it (20.Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. Lode E.T. Coon M.J.

All these contributions are rationalized using an isotropic S = 5/2 spin Hamiltonian of the form, He=g0βHS+D(Sz2-S(S+1)/3)+E(Sx2-Sy2)(Eq. 1) where D and E are the axial and rhombic zero-field splitting parameters, respectively. Samples of NarE suitable for EPR spectroscopy were prepared inside the glove box and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen after elution. Protein content was determined by the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's instructions using bovine serum albumin for standardization. The His6-tagged recombinant NarE was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using a T7 RNA polymerase-driven system. The protein used in this study was purified to apparent homogeneity by a single chromatographic step on an immobilized metal ion chromatography (Ni-NTA) column. Fig. 1A shows an SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified NarE protein, which gave an essentially pure band running slightly above the predicted molecular mass for NarE of 17 kDa. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry gave a more precise mass of 17,269 Da (Fig. 1B). Both results were consistent with the theoretical mass for His-tagged NarE (17,269 Da). Western immunoblotting (Fig. 1A, lane 3) and peptide mass analysis (data not shown) were also performed to confirm the identity of the purified protein. The high solubility of the protein allowed a highly concentrated sample of NarE to be used. Interestingly, when concentrations of ≥7 mg/ml were reached, the protein solution appeared to be golden brown in color, whereas the protein solution at lower concentrations was colorless. A UV absorption spectrum of the protein revealed an increase in absorption at 340 nm and ∼420 nm, in addition to the normal peak at 280 nm caused by side chains of aromatic amino acid residues (Fig. 2A) and with an E420/E280 ratio of 2.3 × 10−2. To maximize purification of the active enzyme, the protein was purified under anaerobic conditions, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and analyzed soon after purification or anaerobically sealed in vials and kept at 4 °C for subsequent analysis. Absorption peaks in the 340–420 nm range can result from a variety of common biological chromophores ranging from carotenes to phorphyrins, but these features are also typical for many proteins containing Fe-S clusters. The iron content of NarE preparation was determined by colorimetric assay and by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results of the two assays are very similar and converge to a ratio <1 iron atom per monomer that is lower than it would be expected for an intact rubredoxin-like cluster. Due to the high level production of recombinant protein only incomplete iron-sulfur cluster formation was achieved leading to a substechiometric ratio. Furthermore, we have not performed all the procedures in strictly anaerobic conditions. Another observation that further supports the presence of iron came from the strong inhibition of transferase activity by the addition of high specific iron chelator O-phenanthroline to the assay mixture (Fig. 2B). In contrast, NADase activity measured in the presence of the iron chelator was less dramatically affected (Fig. 2C). EPR spectroscopy is a well established technique to confirm the presence of iron-sulfur centers in proteins and assign them to specific cluster type. To this purpose, low temperature EPR spectroscopy was performed. The use of UV-visible spectrophotometry analysis paired with EPR spectroscopy assures that no structural change occurs at the iron site, lowering the temperature. EPR spectra were recorded using a fresh sample of the anaerobically purified NarE that had been frozen in glass needles in liquid N2 soon after purification. The native state of the protein shows a complex resonance with g values equal to 4.4, 4.3, and 4.2, as reported in Fig. 3a. This is indicative of a high spin ferric iron, as it occurs in similar cases such as rubredoxin, where the ferric iron is bound to four sulfur atoms in a rhombic site (20.Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. Lode E.T. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5877-5881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EPR spectra of oxidized rubredoxin display a number of features in the g = 4.0–4.8 range arising from the ±3/2 Kramers doublet of a S = 5/2 ground spin multiplet and a g ∼ 9.5 signal from the lowest doublet of this multiplet. In our case, the resonances centered around g = 4.3 are clearly evident, but the contribution at g ∼ 9 is too low to be detected in the native state. The NarE protein was also analyzed in the presence of 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6 and 10 mm FeCl3. FeCl3 strongly increases the intensity of the pattern centered around g = 4.3 and a signal at g = 9.3 becomes evident, as shown in Fig. 3b. In particular with FeCl3, a better outlined series of signals, but very low in intensity, comes out at g = 9.3, 7.3, and 5.7 in addition to the pattern also visible in the native state at g = 4.4, 4.3, and 4.2. This result shows that the agent acts at the metal site of the protein. In contrast, the addition of 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6 does not induce any changes at the iron site of the protein (Fig. 3c), keeping the intensity of the signal at g = 4.3 unchanged. A new broad peak appears due to the presence of the low spin contribution of the Fe(III)-inorganic salt (25.Duelund L. Toftlund H. Spectrochim. Acta. A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc. 2000; 56A: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which remains free in solution, as shown in Fig. 3c. A variety of amino acids, including histidine, aspartate, and arginine (26.Berkovitch F. Nicolet Y. Wan J.T. Jarrett J.T. Drennan C.L. Science. 2004; 303: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), have the ability to coordinate iron. However, cysteine residues, by far the most common ligands, usually hold a critical role in iron coordination. Distribution of cysteine ligands in Fe-S proteins is very heterogeneous, and sometimes this family lacks a unique consensus pattern. NarE contains four cysteines (Cys11, Cys67, Cys128, and Cys130) not involved in disulfide bridges (7.Masignani V. Balducci E. Serruto D. Veggi D. Aricò B. Comanducci M. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2004; 293: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and a Cys-X-Cys iron-sensing motif at C-terminal that is present in well characterized Fe-S proteins like AFT1 (27.Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and the IscA/SufA family reviewed in Ref. 28.Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar. Therefore, to probe the role of the four cysteines in cluster assembly, we constructed a panel of site-directed mutant forms of the protein in which each cysteine was individually changed to serine. The mutated enzymes were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) under conditions identical to the wild-type enzyme and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 4A). All the mutant forms were highly soluble, expressed at levels comparable to wild-type NarE, and recognized by α-NarE antibodies (Fig. 4B). C67S and C128S mutants were colorless upon purification, even at concentration >7 mg/ml, which may reflect reduced iron content. The presence of iron in these forms is reinforced by EPR spectroscopy that showed a weak but clear paramagnetic signal (data not shown). Moreover, UV-visible spectroscopy analyses of C67S and C128S mutants provided a spectrum in which absorption signals at 320 and 420 nm were highly reduced with respect to the wild-type protein (Fig. 5A), suggesting an altered cluster assembly. In contrast, spectroscopic analyses of C11S and C130S mutants showed spectra overlapping with WT NarE (Fig. 5B). To assess the functional relevance of the Fe-S cluster in NarE, transferase activity of the four mutant proteins was tested. Quantification of enzyme activity as a function of protein concentration revealed a 20-fold reduction in the ADP-ribosyltransferase specific activity of C67S and C128S proteins compared with WT (Fig. 6A). By contrast, C11S and C130S mutants maintained transferase activity at a comparable level to wild-type protein (Fig. 6A). We have also measured the E420/E280 ratio in the four generated mutants and compared with the WT protein. While this value was drastically reduced (0.72 and 0.99 × 10−2) in the mutants lacking transferase activity it remained at a level (2.8 and 2.2 × 10−2) comparable with WT protein (2.3 × 10−2) in the mutants with unaltered activity. Like most of the ADP-ribosyltransferases, NarE, in addition to its ability to transfer ADP-ribose to small guanidine compounds, possesses the ability to hydrolyze NAD in the absence of a specific substrate. Therefore, we compared NADase activity in WT and NarE mutants to determine whether mutations that alter cluster organization completely inactivate the enzyme or affect only its ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Although C67S and C128S had not detectable ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, they still possessed NADase activity, which was reduced by ∼45 and 39%, respectively (Fig. 6B). The presence of O-phenanthroline, an iron-chelator, inhibits ∼40 and 45% the transferase activity of C11S and C130S (Fig. 7), thus reinforcing the hypothesis that the substitution at Cys11 and Cys130 with Ser allows the formation of a coordinate and stable Fe-S cluster. Overall, these results are in line with a previous experiment (Fig. 6) supporting the view that the transferase activity is blocked or highly reduced without a coordinated cluster, but the ability to hydrolyze NAD is only weakly affected. Coupled with spectroscopic results, these observations strongly suggest that Cys67 and Cys128 are involved in ligating iron in a correct coordination, which is crucial for NarE transferase but play a less important role for NADase activity.FIGURE 5Spectroscopic characterization of wild-type and mutated NarE.

https://openalex.org/W2067321186,"A key early player in the regulation of myoblast fusion is the gene dumbfounded (duf, also known as kirre). Duf must be expressed, and function, in founder cells (FCs). A fixed number of FCs are chosen from a pool of equivalent myoblasts and serve to attract fusion-competent myoblasts (FCMs) to fuse with them to form a multinucleate muscle-fibre. The spatial and temporal regulation of duf expression and function are important and play a deciding role in choice of fibre number, location and perhaps size. We have used a combination of bioinformatics and functional enhancer deletion approaches to understand the regulation of duf. By transgenic enhancer-reporter deletion analysis of the duf regulatory region, we found that several distinct enhancer modules regulate duf expression in specific muscle founders of the embryo and the adult. In addition to existing bioinformatics tools, we used a new program for analysis of regulatory sequence, PhyloGibbs-MP, whose development was largely motivated by the requirements of this work. The results complement our deletion analysis by identifying transcription factors whose predicted binding regions match with our deletion constructs. Experimental evidence for the relevance of some of these TF binding sites comes from available ChIP-on-chip from the literature, and from our analysis of localization of myogenic transcription factors with duf enhancer reporter gene expression. Our results demonstrate the complex regulation in each founder cell of a gene that is expressed in all founder cells. They provide evidence for transcriptional control--both activation and repression--as an important player in the regulation of myoblast fusion. The set of enhancer constructs generated will be valuable in identifying novel trans-acting factor-binding sites and chromatin regulation during myoblast fusion in Drosophila. Our results and the bioinformatics tools developed provide a basis for the study of the transcriptional regulation of other complex genes."
https://openalex.org/W2018437721,"NMR spectroscopy has been used to map the interaction domain on Escherichia coli thioredoxin for the thioredoxin- dependent 5′-adenylylsulfate reductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaAPR). Seventeen thioredoxin amino acids, all clustered around Cys-32 (the more surface-exposed of the two active-site cysteines), have been located at the PaAPR binding site. The center of the binding domain is dominated by nonpolar amino acids, with a smaller number of charged and polar amino acids located on the periphery of the site. Twelve of the amino acids detected by NMR have non-polar, hydrophobic side chains, including one aromatic amino acid (Trp-31). Four of the thioredoxin amino acids at the PaAPR binding site have polar side chains (Lys-36, Asp-61, Gln-62 and Arg-73), with three of the four having charged side chains. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have shown that replacement of Lys-36, Asp-61, and Arg-73 and of the absolutely conserved Trp-31 significantly decreases the Vmax for the PaAPR-catalyzed reduction of 5′-adenylylsulfate, with E. coli thioredoxin serving as the electron donor. The most dramatic effect was observed with the W31A variant, which showed no activity as a donor to PaAPR. Although the thiol of the active-site Cys-256 of PaAPR is the point of the initial nucleophilic attack by reduced thioredoxin, mutagenic replacement of Cys-256 by serine has no effect on thioredoxin binding to PaAPR.

Thioredoxins contain an active site consisting of two cysteine residues separated by two intervening amino acids that undergo reversible redox reactions. The negative redox potentials of the disulfide/dithiol couples found at the active site in most thioredoxins would suggest that thioredoxin is capable of reducing almost all disulfide bonds in proteins. However, the reality is that thioredoxins are in many cases highly specific for their substrate (8Balmer Y. Koller A. del Val G. Manieri W. Schürmann P. Buchanan B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 9Kumar J.K. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3759-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), suggesting that thioredoxin first interacts with its target protein before reducing the target. The interaction of thioredoxin with target proteins is poorly understood. Both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions have been implicated in the binding (10Wangensteen O.S. Chueca A. Hirasawa M.

One of the first enzymes to have been identified as a thioredoxin target is 3′-phosphoadenylylsulfate (PAPS) 4The abbreviations used are: PAPS3′-phosphoadenylylsulfateAPS5′-adenylylsulfateDTTdithiothreitolHMQChomonuclear single quantum correlationHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceNOESYnuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopyNTRNADPH:thioredoxin oxidoreductasePAP3′,5′-bisphosphatePaAPRP. aeruginosa APS reductase. reductase, an enzyme necessary for sulfur assimilation and cysteine or methionine synthesis. In this process, sulfur is reduced from the +6 oxidation state found in sulfate to the −2 oxidation state found in sulfide. Ultimately, sulfide is incorporated into cysteine and methionine. PAPS reductase, the product of the cysH gene, carries out the 2-electron reduction of 3′-phosphoadenylylsulfate to yield sulfite and adenosine 3′,5′-bisphosphate (PAP). A structurally and catalytically distinct form of CysH also uses thioredoxin as the electron donor but uses 5′-adenylylsulfate (APS) as the substrate instead of PAPS. The key differences between these enzymes are the high sequence divergence (they share only ∼25% identity; Fig. 1) and the fact that although PAPS reductase does not contain any prosthetic group, APS reductase contains a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster. 3′-phosphoadenylylsulfate 5′-adenylylsulfate dithiothreitol homonuclear single quantum correlation heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy NADPH:thioredoxin oxidoreductase 3′,5′-bisphosphate P. aeruginosa APS reductase. Much is known about the structures of PAPS and APS reductases. Thus, these enzymes offer an ideal opportunity to define and compare their interactions with thioredoxin. The three-dimensional structures of Escherichia coli PAPS reductase (11Savage H. Montoya G. Svensson C. Schwenn J.D. Sinning I. Structure. 1997; 5: 895-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and of a disulfide-linked complex between the enzyme and thioredoxin (12Chartron J. Shiau C. Stout C.D. Carroll K.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3942-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) are known. This structural information allowed the catalytic mechanism to be determined. In the first step an absolutely conserved catalytic cysteine residue carries out a nucleophilic attack on PAPS, releasing PAP as the first product and producing a covalently modified form of CysH in which the SO3− residue from PAPS has become covalently bonded to the sulfur of the catalytic cysteine. This is referred to as the S-sulfocysteine intermediate (E-Cys-S-SO3−). Subsequently, the more N-terminal of the two active-site cysteine thiols of reduced thioredoxin carries out a nucleophilic attack of the sulfocysteine intermediate, releasing sulfite and forming a transient disulfide-bonded, covalent protein/protein intermediate between the attacking cysteine of thioredoxin and the active-site cysteine of PAPS reductase. Finally, the second active site cysteine of thioredoxin (the “resolving cysteine”) carries out one final nucleophilic attack producing oxidized thioredoxin and regenerating the original state of PAPS reductase. For the x-ray studies of the PAPS reductase/thioredoxin complex, a mono-cysteine mutant of thioredoxin in which the resolving cysteine had been replaced by alanine was used to trap the intermediate (12Chartron J. Shiau C. Stout C.D. Carroll K.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3942-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A similar catalytic mechanism has been proposed for bacterial APS reductases with the difference that the initial reaction is with APS rather than PAPS (12Chartron J. Shiau C. Stout C.D. Carroll K.S.

Shiau C. Stout C.D. Carroll K.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3942-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Previous studies carried out in two of our laboratories demonstrated that the APS reductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaAPR), like PAPS reductase, could form a disulfide-linked covalent complex with E. coli thioredoxin (17Kim S.K.

PaAPR was also shown to form a similar adduct with a cytoplasmic h-type thioredoxin from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In these experiments mono-cysteine variants of the E. coli and C. reinhardtii thioredoxins, in which the resolving cysteine was eliminated by mutagenesis, were used to trap the disulfide-linked PaAPR-thioredoxin complexes. These studies also identified the C-terminal, catalytic Cys-256 of PaAPR as the site for disulfide formation with thioredoxin and demonstrated that PaAPR could form non-covalent complexes with both thioredoxins with dissociation constants of ∼40 μm (17Kim S.K.

Following up on the initial findings in the current study, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of the non-covalent complex formed between PaAPR and 15N-labeled E. coli thioredoxin has been used to map the interaction domain on thioredoxin for PaAPR. The interaction domain was further explored using a series of site-specific E. coli thioredoxin variants that were designed based on the NMR results. Wild-type PaAPR and its C256S variant were prepared and purified as described previously (17Kim S.K. Rahman A. Mason J.T. Hirasawa M. Conover R.C. Johnson M.K. Miginiac-Maslow M. Keryer E. Knaff D.B.

The gene encoding E. coli thioredoxin 1 (hereafter referred to simply as thioredoxin) was cloned by PCR into the region between the NdeI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites of the pET28b vector (Novagen) by PCR using 5′-AGCTTATACCATATGAGCGATAAAATTATTCACCTG-3′ as a forward primer and 5′-TAACATTGGATCCTTACGCCAGGTTAGCGTCGAG-3′ as a reverse primer and E. coli genomic DNA as a template. After cloning into the pET28b vector, the DNA sequence was confirmed by sequencing in the Biotechnology Core Facility at Texas Tech University. The E. coli thioredoxin was expressed and purified as described previously (17Kim S.K. Rahman A. Mason J.T. Hirasawa M. Conover R.C. Johnson M.K. Miginiac-Maslow M. Keryer E. Knaff D.B. Leustek T.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14877-14884Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 15N labeling of E. coli thioredoxin was accomplished by growing E. coli cells harboring the expression plasmid in M9 minimal medium containing salts, 0.5% d-glucose, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mg of thiamine, trace elements, a vitamin mixture, 50 μg of kanamycin, and 0.5 g of [15N]ammonium chloride (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories, Inc., Andover, MA) per liter of culture. The 15N-labeled E. coli thioredoxin was purified using the same method used to purify the unlabeled thioredoxin. Site-specific mutation of E. coli thioredoxin was carried out using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the primers used to create all of these thioredoxin variants are shown in Table 1 (sequences of the genes encoding these variants were confirmed by DNA sequencing in the Biotechnology Core Facility at Texas Tech University). These mutated thioredoxin variants were expressed and purified using the same method used for wild-type thioredoxin. All thioredoxin and PaAPR samples used in this study displayed a single Coomassie Blue-staining band after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate.TABLE 1Sequences of oligonucleotide primers used in site-directed mutagenesis PCR amplificationPrimerSequence 5′–3′Mutated codonW31A ForGAT TTC TGG GCA GAG GCG TGC GGT CCG TGC AAA ATGTGG → GCGW31A RevTTT GCA CGG ACC GCA CGC CTC TGC CCA GAA ATCW31F ForGAT TTC TGG GCA GAG TTT TGC GGT CCG TGC AAA ATGTGG → TTTW31F RevTTT GCA CGG ACC GCA AAA CTC TGC CCA GAA ATCK36E ForTGG TGC GGT CCG TGC GAA ATG ATC GCC CCG ATT CAAA → GAAK36E RevAAT CGG GGC GAT CAT TTCGCA CGG ACC GCA CCA CK36R ForTGG TGC GGT CCG TGC AGA ATG ATC GCC CCG ATT CAAA → AGAK36R RevAAT CGG GGC GAT CAT TCTGCA CGG ACC GCA CCA CD61N ForGCA AAA CTG AAC ATC AAT CAA AAC CCT GGC ACT GGAT → AATD61N RevAGT GCC AGG GTT TTG ATT GAT GTT CAG TTT TGCD61K ForGCA AAA CTG AAC ATC AAA CAA AAC CCT GGC ACT GGAT → AAAD61K RevAGT GCC AGG GTT TTG TTT GAT GTT CAG TTT TGCR73E ForCCG AAA TAT GGC ATC GAA GGT ATC CCG ACT CTGCGT → GAAR73E RevCAG AGT CGG GAT ACC TTC GAT GCC ATA TTT CGGR73K ForCCG AAA TAT GGC ATC AAA GGT ATC CCG ACT CTGCGT → AAAR73K RevCAG AGT CGG GAT ACC TTT GAT GCC ATA TTT CGGK100E ForTCT AAA GGT CAG TTG GAA GAG TTC CTC GAC GCTAAA → GAAK100E RevAGC GTC GAG GAA CTC TTC CAA CTG ACC TTT AGAD104K ForTTG AAA GAG TTC CTC AAAGCT AAC CTG GCG TAAGAC → AAAD104K RevTTA CGC CAG GTT AGC TTT GAG GAA CTC TTT CAA Open table in a new tab The gene encoding E. coli NADPH:thioredoxin oxidoreductase (hereafter abbreviated NTR) was cloned into the pET28b vector between the NdeI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites by PCR using 5′-ACGTCATATGGGCACGACCAAACACAG-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-ACGTGGATCCTTATTTTGCGTCAGCTAAACC-3′ as the reverse primer and with E. coli genomic DNA as the template. After induction by isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the NTR-pET28b vector were harvested and broken by a French press, and the extract was centrifuged. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm pore-size membrane and applied to a Ni2+ affinity column (Hi-Trap Chelating HP, obtained from Amersham Biosciences) incorporated into a BioCAD perfusion chromatography system (PerSeptive BioSciences). SDS-PAGE analysis showed a single Coomassie staining band. Absorbance spectra in the visible and ultraviolet regions were measured at 0.5-nm spectral resolution using a Shimadzu Model 2401PC spectrophotometer. Dissociation constants (Kd) for the complex between PaAPR and thioredoxin were measured using the spectral perturbation method described previously (17Kim S.K. Rahman A. Mason J.T. Hirasawa M.

Oxidation-reduction titrations were carried out using mixtures of oxidized and reduced dithiothreitol (DTT) for redox equilibration at defined ambient potentials followed by labeling of reduced thioredoxin with the fluorescent thiol modifier monobromobimane as described previously (19Setterdahl A.T. Chivers P.T. Hirasawa M. Lemaire S.D. Keryer E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Kim S.K. Mason J. Jacquot J.P. Longbine C.C. de Lamotte-Guery F. Knaff D.B.

Biochem. 1998; 255: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The activity of the NADPH-dependent E. coli NTR was measured by following the reaction of reduced thioredoxin with 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), as described by Krause and Holmgren (21Krause G. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4056-4066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rates were calculated from changes in absorbance at 412 nm using an extinction coefficient of 13.6 mm−1 cm−1, and the data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten Equation using Microsoft Excel. The enzymatic activity of PaAPR with wild-type and site-specific variants of E. coli thioredoxin (with the exception of the R73E variant; see below) was measured by coupling the PaAPR-catalyzed oxidation of thioredoxin to the reduction of thioredoxin by NADPH catalyzed by E. coli NTR. The 1-ml reaction contained 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm sodium sulfate, 100 μm APS, 5 μm E. coli NTR, 300 nm β-NADPH, 5 μm PaAPR, and E. coli thioredoxin (either wild type or a site-specific variant) at concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, or 12.5 μm. The oxidation of NADPH was monitored by following absorbance decreases at 340 nm. Rates were calculated from the amount of NADPH oxidized after 1 min using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1 cm−1. Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Microsoft Excel. In the case of the R73E variant of thioredoxin, which showed no activity as an electron acceptor in the NTR-catalyzed reaction, PaAPR enzymatic activity was assayed essentially as described by Bick et al. (22Bick J.A. Dennis J.J. Zylstra G.J. Nowack J. Leustek T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The 100-μl reaction mixture contained 5 μmol of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 5 nmol of [35S]APS (2500 Bq nmol−1), and 10 ng of PaAPR. The concentrations of the reduced forms of wild-type thioredoxin and its R73E were varied up to a maximum of 50 μm, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30 °C. A reaction lacking thioredoxin served as the blank. Thioredoxin was reduced by incubation for 60 min on ice with 5 mm freshly prepared reduced DTT in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). DTT was removed using a Millipore Biomax-5 centrifugal filter device centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. After ultrafiltration, the concentration of residual DTT was estimated to be ∼0.02 mm, a concentration of DTT that was shown to produce negligible rates of APS reduction by PaAPR in the absence of thioredoxin. The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism 4.03. All NMR samples were prepared in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm Na2SO4, 10% D2O, and 0.02% NaN3. The pH was adjusted by adding small amounts of 1 m NaOH or 1 m HCl to the sample. For all experiments, 15N-thioredoxin was present at a concentration of 75 μm, and the concentration of PaAPR was varied from 0 to 195 μm for the wild-type protein and from 0 to 407 μm for the C256S variant of PaAPR. NMR experiments were performed at 20 °C using a Varian INOVA Unity 600 spectrometer fitted with a normal triple resonance (HCN) probe and a z-field gradient coil. 1H,15N Sofast-HMQC (23Schanda P. Kupce E. Brutscher B. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 33: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) data were acquired with 512 complex points and a spectral width of 10,000 Hz in F2 (1H) and 64 complex points, 2200 Hz in F1 (15N). The recycle delay was 0.1 s, and the number of transients used was 256. All spectra were processed using NMRPIPE scripts (24Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar) and were analyzed with NMRVIEW software (25Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). The HN resonance assignments for thioredoxin used in this work were obtained from the BioMagRes data bank, accession numbers 62 and 1812 (26Nooren I.M. Thornton J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3486-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 27LeMaster D.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 28Chandrasekhar K. Krause G. Holmgren A. Dyson H.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This assignment was made at 30 °C in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5.7) containing 150 mm NaCl. Because of the instability of PaAPR under these experimental conditions, the interaction between PaAPR and thioredoxin was studied at 20 °C in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm Na2SO4. To check thioredoxin HN resonance assignments under these experimental conditions, a 15N NOESY-HSQC spectrum was recorded with 512 complex points in F3 (1H), 96 complex points in F1 (1H), 38 complex points in F2 (15N), and a mixing time of 150 ms. Mapping of the binding interface was achieved in a series of NMR titration experiments in which 1H,15N Sofast-HMQC spectra of 15N-labeled thioredoxin (75 μm) were recorded as a function of increasing amounts of unlabeled wild-type PaAPR (from 15 to 195 μm). The titration included eight different PaAPR/thioredoxin ratios ranging from 0:1.0 to 2.6:1.0. 1H,15N Sofast-HMQC spectra were recorded at each titration point. A similar titration was performed using 15N-labeled thioredoxin (75 μm) and the unlabeled C256S variant of PaAPR (at concentrations ranging from 0 to 407 μm). The perturbations observed in the thioredoxin spectrum during titration were quantified by calculating the weighted average ΔAV of 1H and 15N chemical shifts given by the equation ΔAV=[(ΔδHN2+ΔδN2/25)/2]1/2(Eq. 1) where Δδ is the chemical shift variation between free thioredoxin and thioredoxin bound to PaAPR. Our earlier work on the interaction of PaAPR with thioredoxin demonstrated that the two proteins could form a non-covalent complex (17Kim S.K. Rahman A. Mason J.T. Hirasawa M. Conover R.C. Johnson M.K. Miginiac-Maslow M. Keryer E. Knaff D.B. Leustek T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1710: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with a Kd of ∼40 μm (with the exact value depending on the specific thioredoxin used and on the buffer composition). This non-covalent complex appears to function as the precursor to the disulfide-linked, covalent 1:1 complex formed between the enzyme and thioredoxin as a transient reaction intermediate, with Cys-256 supplying the enzyme site for transient covalent attachment of the thioredoxin (17Kim S.K. Rahman A. Mason J.T. Hirasawa M. Conover R.C. Johnson M.K. Miginiac-Maslow M. Keryer E. Knaff D.B. Leustek T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1710: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Given that the Kd for the non-covalent complex is in the range appropriate for studying protein/protein interactions by NMR spectroscopy (26Nooren I.M. Thornton J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3486-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), an attempt to map the site on thioredoxin involved in binding PaAPR using NMR seemed feasible. Although thioredoxin from P. aeruginosa was not available, E. coli thioredoxin can serve as an efficient electron donor to the thioredoxin-dependent PaAPR, and previous work in our laboratory had already characterized a number of aspects of the interaction of this thioredoxin with PaAPR (17Kim S.K. Rahman A. Mason J.T. Hirasawa M. Conover R.C. Johnson M.K. Miginiac-Maslow M. Keryer E. Knaff D.B. Leustek T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1710: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, P. aeruginosa PAO1, the strain from which PaAPR was cloned, contains a thioredoxin that is 86% conserved when compared with E. coli thioredoxin. For these reasons and also because a complete NMR assignment already exists in the literature for E. coli thioredoxin (27LeMaster D.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 28Chandrasekhar K. Krause G. Holmgren A. Dyson H.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), E. coli thioredoxin was chosen for this study. Fig. 2 shows the effects of titrating 15N-labeled, wild-type E. coli thioredoxin with wild-type PaAPR on the HMQC spectrum and identifies the E. coli thioredoxin amino acid residues experiencing the greatest changes as a result of the addition of PaAPR. Fig. 3 displays these results as a histogram in which the 1H and 15N chemical shift variations are plotted against thioredoxin sequence position. The data of Fig. 3 were then used to construct a map (Fig. 4) of the binding domain for PaAPR on thioredoxin. Before describing the details of this interaction domain, it should be mentioned that an area of ∼800 Å2 on the surface of E. coli thioredoxin that is exposed to the solvent in the free protein becomes buried as a result of complex formation with PaAPR. The size of this buried area is consistent with buried surface areas reported for other protein/protein complexes with Kd values of ∼40 μm (29Nooren I.M. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 991-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Interaction of E. coli thioredoxin with PaAPR. The weighted average of the 1H and 15N chemical shift changes resulting from binding to PaAPR is plotted as a function of thioredoxin sequence position. The weighted average is given by Equation 1, Δδ is the chemical shift difference in ppm between free thioredoxin and in the presence of 2.6 eq of PaAPR. Residues with the greatest chemical shift variations have been labeled with their primary sequence numbers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Mapping of the thioredoxin-PaAPR interaction on the thioredoxin solvent-accessible surface.

The red dotted lines show the active-sites Pro-34 (not detected in the 15N-HSQC spectra).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 4 shows a map of the interaction domain on E. coli thioredoxin for PaAPR in which the amino acids experiencing the largest shift in NMR characteristics are color-coded on the structure of the E. coli protein. The interaction domain on E. coli thioredoxin for PaAPR involves a central hydrophobic core that includes residues Trp-31, Gly-33, Met-37, Ala-39, Ile-41, Leu-42, Ile-60, Ile-72, Ile-75, Gly-92, Ala-93, and Leu-94, all of which surround the more N-terminal cysteine of the catalytic site, Cys-32 (the other catalytic site cysteine, Cys-36, is buried in the interior of the protein and is not surface-accessible). On the periphery of this hydrophobic central domain lies one polar, uncharged amino acid (Gln-62) and three charged amino acids (Lys-35, Asp-61, and Arg-73) that are also involved in binding PaAPR. Data essentially identical to that shown in Figs. 2 and 3 for the effect of wild-type PaAPR on the NMR spectrum of E. coli thioredoxin were obtained with the C256S variant of PaAPR (data not shown). To verify the involvement of several thioredoxin residues identified by NMR mapping of the interaction with PaAPR, a series of site-directed variants of E. coli thioredoxin were generated, and the effects of these amino acid replacements on binding and kinetic parameters with wild-type PaAPR were investigated. However, because the reduced thioredoxins used as possible electron-donating substrates for PaAPR in this study were generated by NADPH reduction of the oxidized thioredoxins in a reaction catalyzed by E. coli NTR (see “Experimental Procedures”), it was important to first make sure that the thioredoxin variants used were in fact reduced at reasonable rates by NTR. If that were not the case, then a lack of NADPH oxidation could not be interpreted as an inability of a thioredoxin variant to serve as a donor to PaAPR. Although earl"
