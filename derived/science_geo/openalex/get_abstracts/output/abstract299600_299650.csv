The two chemicals, D735 and F461, were highly specific and selective against the pathogens without injury of the hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2092739065,"Mice received a single training trial on an inhibitory avoidance task and a retention trial 24 hours later. Electroshock stimulation, administered 25 seconds after the training trial, produced amnesia even if the convulsion was prevented by ether anesthesia. The amnesia produced by such shock is apparently due to the electric current and not to the convulsion."
https://openalex.org/W2085459428,"Enzyme amplifier systems have been implicated in such diverse physiological phenomena as vision and blood coagulation. Such systems are considered from a general point of view and the concept of steady state gain of the enzyme amplifier is introduced. Expressions for the latter are obtained, and several of the main factors influencing gain are discussed. The effect of the duration of the activation on the characteristics of the response is discussed, and the influence of small changes in the rate constants on the steady state gain is considered."
https://openalex.org/W2010226043,"Unconditioned aggression between paired animals in response to electric shock has been previously demonstrated. In this study, with the use of classical Pavlovian conditioning procedures, aggression was produced between paired rats as a response to a tone stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W2021052427,"Large alveolar cells of normal dog lung are rich in enzymes concerned with oxidative and synthetic pathways. In three experimental situations where ability of the lung to produce surfactant was impaired, the enzyme-rich cells were lacking or absent. Findings support the concept that these cells are sites of active metabolism, possibly including production of surfactant."
https://openalex.org/W2046565536,"The injection of 60 micrograms of 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene into newborn mice gave rise to a very high incidence of malignant thymomas. The tumor incidence was directly related to the dose of the carcinogen. The neonatal injection of the carcinogen also resulted in a depression in the immune response when the animals were challenged with an antigert as early as 4 weeks or as late as 11 weeks after administration of the carcinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1991068695,"An erythropoietic factor was extracted with hypotonic phosphate buffer from the kidneys of hypoxic rats. Normal rat serum enhanced the activity of this factor, which is associated with the light mitochondrial fraction. The data suggest that the renal factor is not physiologically active unless it interacts with a serum carrier or activator, or that the factor may be an enzyme which produces erythropoietin from some serum substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2082583256,"During stage 1 sleep, subjects responded to suggestions on two or more nights, up to 5 months apart. While they were awake they did not recall the material to which they successfully responded while asleep on a subsequent night."
https://openalex.org/W2012322942,Rats were fed a basic diet supplemented with sodium alginate and with tracer amounts of strontium-85 and calcium-45. Absorption of strontium was always inhibited by the alginate to a greater extent than absorption of calcium. Discrimination against strontium was greatest in alginate containing a high proportion of guluronic acid.
https://openalex.org/W2008972678,"Small lesions placed near the diencephalic, mesencephalic junction, in either the lateral or medial mammillary region, resulted in an increase of copulatory behavior. This increase was expressed both by increased numbers of copulation plugs formed per 14-day interval and by increased percentage of days on which copulation occurred. Inhibitory structures thus form an essential part of the circuitry involved in mediation of sex behavior in the male."
https://openalex.org/W1994797535,"Increase in body weight, spontaneous running activity, and adrenal cortical function have been studied in rats exposed to a random lighting schedule. In two separate experiments, grouped control animals were given 12 or 14 hours of light alternating with 12 or 10 hours of darkness, respectively, while coresponding grouped experimental animals were given the same total amounts of light and darkness per 24 hour period in a randomized pattern. Random light for periods of 17 to 40 days exerted no influence on growth rate, on weights of endocrine organs, or on adrenal response to adrenocorticotrophic hormone. However, the physiological fluctuation of group running activity and adrenal steroid secretion was abolished. Group desynchronization and the development of circadian rhythms having periods both shorter and longer than 24 hours appear to have replaced the synchronized group rhythmicity."
https://openalex.org/W2035123250,"Spine arrangements on silicified specimens of Waagenoconcha abichi (Waagen) from the Khisor Range of West Pakistan suggest that the juvenile shell attached itself to a foreign object, and that the adult shell lay on its ventral valve in the substrate, anchored and stabilized by a dense corona of long slender spines around the ventral visceral disc."
https://openalex.org/W1986718138,"Two inbred strains of mice show a threefold difference in duodenal phosphatase activity at 11 days of age. When half-litters of the two strains are interchanged between the two mothers on the day of birth, enzyme activity in young of the low-activity strain is unaffected at 11 days by the source of milk, but is significantly reduced in high-activity young nursed by a low-activity mother."

https://openalex.org/W2029798610,"Though the excitation of azoethane by ultraviolet light is primarily an electronic process, a considerable fraction of the energy must go into the excitation of vibrations. As in unimolecular reactions, it is then possible for the vibrational energy to accumulate by chance in a weak bond, causing disruption of the molecule. On the other hand, deactivation may occur through collisions with other molecules. The greater the amount of energy put into the molecules, the more rapidly decomposition should occur and the less effective should be deactivation by collision. We have, therefore, investigated the photolysis at 3519, 3660, and 3776 A, and, assuming deactivation at every collision, the average lifetimes of the activated molecules were determined to be roughly 1.6, 2.6, and 3.9×10−10 sec, respectively. The results have been compared with earlier results at 3660 A at a series of different temperatures ranging up to about 120° above room temperature. They have been discussed in terms of the classical theory of unimolecular reactions. Though not all the parameters can be completely determined, and though some complications may be present, a reasonably good picture of the mechanism can be given on the basis of this theory."
