The cell death resulting from induction of the overexpression of Bax was prevented by inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) with cyclosporin A (CyA) in combination with the phospholipase A2 inhibitor aristolochic acid (ArA). The caspase-3 inhibitor Z-Asp-Glu-Val aspartic acid fluoromethylketone (Z-DEVD-FMK) had no effect on the loss of viability. The MPT was measured as the CyA plus ArA-preventable loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). The MPT was accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, caspase-3 activation in the cytosol, cleavage of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), and DNA fragmentation, all of which were inhibited by CyA plus ArA. Z-DEVD-FMK had no effect on the loss of ΔΨm and the redistribution of cytochrome c but did prevent caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation. It is concluded that Bax induces the MPT, a critical event in the loss of cell viability. In addition to the cell death, the MPT mediates other typical manifestations of apoptosis in this model, namely release of cytochrome c, caspase activation with PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation.

Bax is a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that has been associated with apoptotic cell death both in cell culture (1Hassouna I. Wickert H. Zimmerman M. Gillardon F. Neurosci.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), and the cell death that accompanied the overexpression of Bax was associated with loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and an increased production of reactive oxygen species (8Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). However, neither the nature of the responsible mitochondrial alterations nor their relationship to the loss of cell viability and to other features of apoptosis have been defined. Here we show that the induction of the overexpression of Bax in stably transfected Jurkat cells induces the MPT, an event that is accompanied by typical features of apoptosis, namely cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c, caspase activation, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP), DNA fragmentation, and cell death. Inhibition of the MPT prevents all manifestations of apoptosis, whereas caspase inhibition prevents PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation but not cytochrome c release or cell death. Jurkat cells were stably transfected with an inducible expression system encoding mouse Bax. Total RNA was isolated from mouse fibrosarcoma cells (L929). A 5′-primer (5′ CCCAAGCTTATGGACGGGTCCGGGGAG 3′) and 3′-primer (5′-GGAATTCAGCCCATCTTCTTCCAG 3′) were designed and utilized for reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction amplification of the cDNA for Bax from the isolated total RNA. The polymerase chain reaction products were electrophoresed, and the 579-base pair mouse Bax cDNA was identified. The fragment was then cloned into pIND downstream of the ecdysone response element to generate pINDBax. The insert was sequenced and found to be 100% identical to the published sequence of mouse Bax (GenBankTM accession number L22472). To generate inducible clones, wild-type Jurkat cells were first transfected with pVgRXR, which encodes for a heterodimer of the ecdysone receptor, and the retinoid X receptor, which binds the ecdysone response element (encoded on pINDBax) in the presence of muristerone A. Stable transfectants were obtained (JtVgRXR) and in turn transfected with the pIND(Bax) construct. Stable transfectants (JtBax1 and 2) were then selected. JtLacz1 clones were generated as above with the exception that cDNA for β-galactosidase was cloned into pIND instead of Bax. Cells (5 × 105) were pelleted at 700 × g, resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min. Protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples were then run on an 8 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel for determination of PARP cleavage or Bax expression, respectively. Kaleidoscope prestained standards (Bio-Rad) were used to determine molecular weights. The gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. For the determination of PARP cleavage, the blots were probed with anti-human PARP monoclonal antibody (C2–10; Enzyme Systems Products, Dublin, CA) at 1:5,000 dilution. For Bax expression, a rabbit polyclonal anti-Bax antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used at a 1:2,000 dilution. A secondary horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat-antimouse or goat-antirabbit antibody at 1:2,000 was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence for PARP or Bax, respectively. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and the ability of viable cells to reduce 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS). For trypan blue exclusion, 10 μl of a 0.5% solution of the dye was added to 100 μl of treated cells (1.0 × 105/ml). The suspension was then applied to a hemocytometer. Both viable and nonviable cells were counted. A minimum of 200 cells were counted for each data point in a total of eight microscopic fields. For the MTS assay, a 100-μl aliquot of cells (1.0 × 106 cells/ml) was placed in the well of a 96-well plate. The reaction was started by the addition of MTS and phenazine methosulfate (PMS). The absorbance change obtained upon reduction of MTS was read 90 min later with a 96-well plate reader at 490 nm. 100% cell killing was determined by the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.5%, 30 min prior to MTS and PMS addition. The MTS assay and trypan blue exclusion gave identical results. Mitochondrial energization was determined as the retention of the dye 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine (DiOC6(3); Molecular Probes Inc, Eugene, OR). Cells (5 × 105 in 500 μl of complete RPMI 1640 medium) were loaded with 100 nmDiOC6(3) during the last 30 min of treatment. The cells were then pelleted at 700 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended and washed in PBS two times. The pellet was then lysed by the addition of 600 μl of deionized water followed by homogenization. The concentration of retained DiOC6(3) was read on a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 488 nm excitation and 500 nm emission. Cells (1.0 × 106) were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 ×g for 10 min. The cell pellet was washed in PBS and then lysed in 200 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mmEDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. RNase (0.2 mg/ml) was added, and the lysate was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml) and SDS (final concentration 1%) were added, followed by incubation at 50 °C for 16 h. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and then chloroform, precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate, and electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels. The assay is based on the ability of the active enzyme to cleave the chromophore pNA from the enzyme substrate DEVD-pNA. Cytosolic fractions isolated as above were diluted 1:1 with 2× reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). DEVD-pNA was added to a final concentration of 50 μm, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were then transferred to a 96-well plate, and absorbance measurements were made with a 96-well plate reader at 405 nm. Cells (1.0 × 107) were harvested by centrifugation at 600 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed once in PBS and then resuspended in 3 volumes of isolation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mmsodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm aprotinin) in 250 mm sucrose. After chilling on ice for 3 min, the cells were disrupted by 40 strokes of a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 2,500 × g at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The mitochondria were then pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was removed and filtered through 0.2 μm and then 0.1 μm Ultrafree MC filters (Millipore) to give cytosolic protein. Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions (20 μl, 250 μg of protein) were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Cytochrome c was detected by a monoclonal antibody to cytochrome c (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) at a dilution of 1:5,000. Secondary goat-antimouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody (1:2000) was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Caspase-3 inhibitor (Z-Asp-Glu-Val aspartic acid fluoromethylketone, Z-DEVD-FMK, Kamiya Biomedical Co. Seattle, WA), was dissolved in Me2SO and added to cells at 50 μm. Cyclosporin A (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added at 5 μm. Aristolochic acid (Biomol) was dissolved in PBS and added at 50 μm. FK506 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and cypermethrin (Calbiochem) were dissolved in ethanol and added at 5 and 10 μm, respectively. All additions were 1% v/v or less. Control experiments demonstrated that Me2SO and ethanol had no effect on any of the parameters measured under the conditions tested. To study the mechanism of action of Bax, we produced clones (JtBax1 and JtBax2) of stably transfected Jurkat T cells in which Bax expression is inducible by muristerone A. Bax was not detected in uninduced JtBax1 cells (Fig. 1 a). In the presence of muristerone A, however, Bax expression was detected within 30 min and increased for 4 h (Fig. 1 a). Similar results were obtained with JtBax2 cells (data not shown). Bax expression was accompanied by cell death that was detectable within 2 h (Fig. 2 a). By 16 h, 75% of the cells were dead. As a control, the cDNA for β-galactosidase was cloned downstream of the muristerone A-inducible promoter. Stable transfectants (JtLacz1) were produced that, upon induction by muristerone A, exhibited an increase in β-galactosidase (1000 microunits/106 cells at 6 h). However, induced JtLacz1 cells showed no loss of viability over the same time course that JtBax1 cells were killed (Fig. 2 a).Figure 2Cell killing upon induction of Bax expression and its inhibition by CyA and ArA. Panel a, JtBax1 (closed circles) and JtLacz1 (closed squares) clones were treated with 1 μm muristerone A. Alternatively in panel b, JtBax1 cells were pretreated with either 5 μm CyA plus 50 μm ArA (closed squares) or 50 μm Z-DEVD-FMK (closed circles) 30 min prior to the addition of muristerone A. Cell viability was determined at the times indicated. All data points are the mean of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The MPT refers to the regulated opening of a large, nonspecific pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane (9Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The MPT is inhibited by cyclosporin A (CyA) (10Fournier N. Ducet G. Crevat A. J.

Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16440-16449Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and in the intact cell (14Imberti R. Nieminen A.L. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1992; 78: 27-38PubMed Google Scholar). CyA in combination with the phospholipase inhibitor aristolochic acid (ArA) completely prevented the killing of JtBax1 cells upon induction of Bax expression (Fig. 2 b). By contrast, the caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK (15Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar) had no effect on the loss of viability (Fig. 2 b). As a control, the same concentration of Z-DEVD-FMK effectively prevented the killing of JtBax1 cells upon activation of the Fas receptor with an anti-Fas antibody (data not shown). Importantly, CyA plus ArA did not alter the time course or level of Bax expression induced by muristerone A (Fig. 1 b). In addition to its ability to inhibit the MPT, cyclosporin A binds to cytosolic cyclophilin A, and the resulting complex inhibits the Ca2+-regulated protein phosphatase calcineurin (16Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.R. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3618) Google Scholar, 17Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). The ability of CyA to prevent the cell killing by Bax was not a consequence of the inhibition by CyA of calcineurin. Two other calcineurin inhibitors, cypermethrin A and FK506, alone or in combination with ArA, did not prevent cell killing produced by Bax expression (Table I). FK506 and cypermethrin are inactive against the MPT (18Pastorino J.G. Simbula G. Yamamoto K. Glascott Jr., P.A. Rothman R.J. Farber J.L. J. Biol.

We have used the CyA-inhibitable loss of ΔΨm to document the MPT in intact cells independently of the effect of the transition on cell viability (18Pastorino J.G. Simbula G. Yamamoto K.

The fluorescent dye DiOC6(3) localizes to mitochondria as a consequence of ΔΨm, and the MPT reduces the accumulation of DiOC6(3) as a consequence of the loss of ΔΨm (20Vayssière J.-L. Petit P.X.

In JtBax1 cells, CCCP, a proton ionophore that dissipates ΔΨm, produced a time-dependent loss of DiOC6(3) (Table II), a result indicating the mitochondrial localization of the majority of the dye. Importantly, CyA plus ArA had no effect on the rate or extent of the loss of DiOC6(3) caused by CCCP (Table II), a result demonstrating the specificity of CyA plus ArA in preventing the loss of ΔΨm as a consequence of the MPT.Table IIInability of CyA plus ArA to prevent the loss of ΔΨm produced by CCCPTreatmentDiOC6(3) retention (percent control)1 h2 hCCCP (10 μm)37 ± 717 ± 7CCCP (10 μm) + CyA and ArA33 ± 515 ± 3JtBax1 cells were either left untreated or treated with CyA and ArA for 30 min.

CCCP was then added to all cultures, and the ability of cells to take up and retain DiOC6(3) was determined as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Treatment of JtBax1 cells with muristerone A produced a steady decline in ΔΨm, (Fig. 3 a), and the time course of the loss of ΔΨm upon induction of Bax overexpression paralleled that of the loss of viability. Within 4 h, more than 30% of the dye was lost from the cells (Fig. 3 a), and 25% of the cells had died (Fig. 2 a). Within 8 h, retention of DiOC6(3) was reduced by 65%, and 40% of the cells were dead. The time-dependent loss of DiOC6(3) fluorescence that resulted from the induction of Bax expression was completely inhibited by CyA plus ArA (Fig. 3, a and b). Treatment of JtLacz1 cells with muristerone A had no effect on the retention of the dye over the same time course (Fig. 3 a). Consistent with its inability to prevent the loss of viability (Fig. 2 b), the caspase inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK had no effect on Bax-induced mitochondrial depolarization (Fig. 3 b), a result that confirms a previous report (8Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Degradation of DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments (180-base pair multiples) is a hallmark of apoptosis(22Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4153) Google Scholar, 23Wyllie A.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Induction of Bax expression produced extensive DNA fragmentation, detectable within 2 h and complete by 4 h (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). There was no DNA fragmentation in JtLacz1 cells treated with muristerone A (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8). DNA fragmentation induced by Bax expression was a consequence of the MPT, as shown by its prevention by CyA plus ArA (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). DNA fragmentation also depends on caspase-3 activity, as shown by the ability of Z-DEVD-FMK to prevent the appearance of the characteristic ladder of fragmented DNA (Fig. 4,lanes 5 and 6). Cleavage of the nuclear enzyme PARP by caspase-3 is another prominent indicator of apoptosis (24Dubrez L. Savoy I. Hamman A. Solary E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5504-5512Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Induction of Bax expression resulted in PARP cleavage that was evident within 2 h and complete by 6 h (Fig. 5). CyA plus ArA, as well as Z-DEVD-FMK, prevented this cleavage of PARP (Fig. 5).Figure 5CyA plus ArA inhibits PARP cleavage.JtBax1 cells (5.0 × 106 cells in 24-well plates) were either left untreated or pretreated for 30 min with either CyA plus ArA or Z-DEVD-FMK. Afterward, muristerone A was added to induce Bax expression. At the indicated time points, the cells were harvested, and PARP cleavage was determined by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Induction of Bax expression produced a steady increase in the caspase-3 activity of cytosolic extracts of JtBax1 cells, an effect completely prevented by CyA and ArA (Fig. 6 a). As a control, addition of CyA plus ArA to the cytosolic extracts obtained from JtBax1 cells induced with muristerone A had no effect on caspase-3 activity (Fig. 6 b), indicating that CyA plus ArA do not inhibit this enzyme directly or any other component necessary for its activation. Z-DEVD-FMK, added to the JtBax1 cells at the time of induction by muristerone A, prevented the increase in caspase-3 activity (Fig. 6 b). The MPT releases cytochrome c from the intramembranous space (25Kantrow S.P. Piantadosi C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 26Igbavboa U. Zwizinski C.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5504-5512Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) from the mitochondrial matrix. Cytochrome c released from mitochondria during apoptosis promotes the activation of caspase-3 (27Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar, 28Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). Bax expression produced a progressive release of cytochrome c to the cytosol of JtBax1 cells and a concomitant decrease in the content of cytochromec in the mitochondria (Fig. 7 a and b). Cytochrome c release to the cytosol and its depletion from the mitochondria was completely inhibited by CyA plus ArA (Fig. 7,a and b). By contrast, Z-DEVD-FMK had no effect on the redistribution of cytochrome c (Fig. 7 c). The data presented above document that the overexpression of Bax induces the MPT, an event that is accompanied by typical features of apoptosis, namely the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP), DNA fragmentation, and cell death (Fig. 8). Inhibition of the MPT prevents all manifestations of apoptosis, whereas caspase inhibition prevents PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation but not cytochrome c release or cell death. Participation of the MPT in our model of apoptosis was shown by the observation that CyA, a known inhibitor of the MPT, in combination with a phospholipase A2 inhibitor, prevents the cell death, as well as the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochromec release. It might be argued that the effect of CyA plus ArA is not necessarily the consequence of an inhibition of the MPT. According to such a scenario, CyA plus ArA interfere with an as yet unidentified mechanism that is both required for the loss of cell viability and is not the MPT. In association with the loss of cell viability, an as yet unidentified mitochondrial injury must be postulated (again not the MPT) that causes, in turn, loss of ΔΨm and the release of cytochrome c. That CyA plus ArA could act in such an enigmatic manner to inhibit a process that has the same consequences as the MPT, an event that is known to be a target of the action of these compounds, seems highly coincidental. Bax may induce the MPT in at least two ways. Bax may interact directly with one or more proteins that reside in either the inner or outer mitochondrial membrane and that regulate or constitute the MPT. Alternatively, Bax may itself form a channel that modifies ion fluxes across the mitochondrial membranes (30Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Montal M.O. Matsuyama S. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5113-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 31Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). In addition to the loss of viability, Bax expression produced the other typical manifestations of apoptosis, namely caspase activation with DNA fragmentation and PARP cleavage. All of these changes are a likely consequence of the MPT, as they were prevented by CyA plus ArA. PARP is cleaved by caspase-3, and DNA fragmentation has recently been linked to the caspases through activation of DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) (32Liu X. Zou H. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). In our model, the activation of caspases is clearly the upstream event since Z-DEVD-CMK prevented PARP cleavage and the fragmentation of DNA. The caspase inhibitor, however, did not prevent induction of the MPT and, thus, the loss of cell viability. These results indicate that caspase activation is downstream of the MPT. The release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria readily accounts for the activation of caspases upon Bax-mediated induction of the MPT. As cytochrome c was retained in the cytosol, it decreased in mitochondria. This redistribution of cytochromec was prevented by CyA plus ArA, but not by Z-DEVD-CMK. The time course of the release of cytochrome c also paralleled that of the loss of mitochondrial energization. However, the consequences of the release of cytochrome c, namely caspase activation (Fig. 6), PARP cleavage (Fig. 5), and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4), evolved over a time course that might appear inconsistent with that of the full evolution of the MPT. PARP cleavage was complete within 6 h, a time at which ΔΨm was reduced by slightly greater than 50% (Fig. 3). We would argue that the release of cytochrome c during the first 6 h following induction of Bax expression and consequent MPT activates caspase-3 to an extent that can account for the degree of PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation occurring during this period. Previously, the MPT was discounted as a mechanism of cytochromec release upon induction of apoptosis by staurosporine in HL-60 cells (27Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar) because the accumulation of cytochrome c in the cytosol preceded a detectable decline in ΔΨm. It deserves, emphasis that the absence of mitochondrial depolarization, as assessed by the redistribution of fluorescent dyes, does not necessarily imply that the MPT has not occurred. The mitochondrial population reacts heterogeneously to induction of the MPT, with some mitochondria undergoing the MPT very early or very late and some not at all (33Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence there can be a redistribution of membrane-sensitive dyes from depolarized to still polarized mitochondria at earlier time points (34Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present report has not defined how the MPT is coupled to the loss of cell viability. Importantly, cell death following the MPT is not necessarily the consequence of the loss of an energy-dependent function. Cell killing with inhibition of electron transport is prevented by CyA without restoration of ΔΨm or ATP levels (35Pastorino J.G. Simbula G. Gilfor E. Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31041-31046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The link between the MPT and the loss of plasma membrane integrity may involve alterations in the cytoskeleton. The microtubule-associated protein MAP2 binds to porin, thereby linking the mitochondria to the cytoskeleton (36Linden M. Karlsson G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although disruption of microtubule structure enhances the MPT (37Evtodienko Y.V. Teplova V.V. Sidash S.S. Ichas F. Mazat J.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it is possible that the opposite is true, that is, the MPT may disrupt the cytoskeleton, a structure that is, in turn, in intimate association with the plasma membrane. Alternatively, the MPT may release mitochondrial matrix proteins, such as mitochondrial phospholipase A2, that may directly damage the plasma membrane (38Schalkwijk C.G. Märki F. Wiesenberg I. van den Bosch H. J. Lipid Mediators. 1991; 4: 83-96PubMed Google Scholar,39Aarsman A.J. de Jong J.G.N. Arnoldussen E. Neys F.W. van Wassenaar P.D. Van den Bosch H. J. Biol.

Recent studies have shown that missense mutations in this gene contribute, evidently through a gain-of-function mechanism, to about 20% of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To define further the physiologic role of this enzyme, a model of mice deficient in this enzyme was generated using gene targeting technology. Mice lacking this enzyme were apparently healthy and displayed no increased sensitivity to hyperoxia. However, they exhibited a pronounced susceptibility to paraquat toxicity. Most surprisingly, female homozygous knock-out mice showed a markedly reduced fertility compared with that of wild-type and heterozygous knock-out mice. Further studies revealed that although these mice ovulated and conceived normally, they exhibited a marked increase in embryonic lethality. These data, for the first time, suggest a role of oxygen free radicals in causing abnormality of female reproduction in mammals.

Lab. Invest. 1982; 47: 412-426PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian cells are equipped with both enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defense mechanisms to minimize the cellular damage resulting from interaction between cellular constituents and ROS (for review, see Ref. 2Forman H.J. Fisher A.B. Gibert D.L. Oxygen and Living Processes: An Interdisciplinary Approach. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1982: 235-249Google Scholar). Despite the presence of these delicate cellular antioxidant systems, an overproduction of ROS in both intracellular and extracellular spaces often occurs upon exposure of cells or individuals to radiation, hyperoxia, and certain chemicals. An unbalanced production of ROS has been postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of a number of clinical disorders such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, ischemia/reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer (for review, see Ref. 3Cross C.E. Halliwell B. Borish E.T. Pryor W.A. Ames B.N. Saul R.L. McCord J.M. Harman D. Ann. Intern. Med. 1987; 107: 526-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). This understanding illustrates the importance of the antioxidant defense system in maintaining normal cellular physiology. However, due to the overlapping activity among some of the antioxidant enzymes, it is generally difficult to define the role of each individual antioxidant enzyme. We are interested in understanding the physiologic relevance of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) under normal physiologic conditions and in defending cells and animals against the pathogenesis of ROS-mediated diseases. The results from previous studies for defining the protective function of this enzyme using cells and animals with augmented enzyme expression have been controversial (4Elroy-Stein O. Groner Y. Cell. 1988; 52: 259-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Elroy-Stein O. Bernstein Y. Groner Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 6Krall J.

It is not clear whether the detrimental effect of CuZn-SOD overexpression is a result of the associated free radical generating activity of this enzyme or of its capability in enhancing nitration of tyrosine by peroxynitrite (10Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5298Crossref Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 11Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I.

Therefore, overexpression of this enzyme may not provide a suitable model to address the nature of this enzyme in cellular antioxidant mechanisms. To define further the role of CuZn-SOD in cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms, we generated, by gene targeting technology, mice lacking this enzyme. Eleven mouseSod1 genomic clones were isolated from a 129/SvJ genomic library purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) by screening with a rat Sod1 cDNA probe (16Ho Y.-S. Crapo J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6746Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An approximately 7.2-kbSacI genomic fragment from clone 30 was found to contain the entire mouse Sod1 gene with a sequence very similar to that published by Benedetto et al. (17Benedetto M. Anzai Y. Gordon J.W. Gene (Amst .). 1991; 99: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To inactivate the mouseSod1 gene, the SmaI and HindIII restriction sites flanking the SmaI-HindIII fragment, which contains sequences from intron 1 to intron 4, were converted into XhoI sites by linker ligation and then inserted into the XhoI site in plasmid vector pPNT (see Ref.18Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, Fig. 1 a). Similarly, linker ligation was also used to clone the EcoRI-SalI fragment containing the 3′-flanking sequence of the gene into the BamHI site in the pPNT vector. The Sod1 targeting vector, in which exon 5 was deleted, was linearized by HindIII digestion and transfected into R1 embryonic stem cells (19Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). Clones resistant to G418 and ganciclovir were screened by Southern blot analysis using a probe 5′ external to the genomic sequence present in the targeting vector. Fifty-two clones were identified from 666 clones screened to contain the expected targeted Sod1 allele. Targeted clones were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts following the standard procedure (20Bradley A. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 113-151Google Scholar). Thirty chimeric mice with near 100% chimerism were generated using Sod1 knock-out clones 5 and 8. Chimeric mice derived from either clone showed 100% transmission of the 129/SvJ chromosomes. The heterozygous CuZn-SOD knock-out (Sod1 +/−) mice were initially derived from breeding between the chimeric mice and C57BL/6 mice. They, therefore, are F1 hybrid between the 129SvJ and C57BL/6 inbred genetic backgrounds. These Sod1 +/− mice were interbred to generate mice with three Sod1 genotypes (Sod1 +/+, Sod1 +/−, and Sod1 −/−). These F2 littermates were used in expression studies including RNA and protein analysis. Since the femaleSod1 −/− mice are not very fertile, breeding was performed between F2 male Sod1 −/− and female Sod1 +/− littermates as well as between F2 Sod1 +/+ male and female littermates to generate a large number of wild-type and knock-out mice for various pathologic and physiologic studies described in this report. Total RNA was isolated from tissues by the guanidinium isothiocyanate-CsCl method as described by Chirgwinet al. (21Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16608) Google Scholar). RNA was denatured with glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide for electrophoresis on an agarose gel buffered with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 (22McMaster G.K. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4835-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Hybridization of the RNA blot filter was performed according to the procedures described by Thomas (23Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5844) Google Scholar). Activities of CuZn-SOD and Mn-SOD were determined using a xanthine oxidase/cytochrome cassay (25Crapo J.D. McCord J.M. Fridovich I. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 382-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). However, acetylated cytochrome c instead of cytochrome c was used in the reaction mixture to minimize interference from cytochrome c reductases and oxidases present in the tissue homogenates (26Azzi A. Montecucco C. Richter C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 65: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). One hundred micrograms of tissue protein were separated on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The SOD activity was then visualized by initially soaking the gel in 2.43 mm nitro blue tetrazolium for 20 min, followed by incubating in a solution of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 0.028 mm riboflavin, and 280 mm Temed. Wild-type and age-matched homozygous knock-out mice were fixed by systemic perfusion with Bouin's fixative through the left ventricle. The tissues were then embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Tissue sections were examined under a light microscope. Vaginal smears were taken daily using a moisturized cotton tip and examined under a light microscope. Entry into the estrous cycle is indicated by an increase in the number of nucleated epithelial cells in vaginal samples. Female mice of threeSod1 genotypes were housed with either maleSod1 +/+ or Sod1 −/−mice. Copulatory plugs were checked at around 9 a.m. each morning. Female mice with plugs were then housed individually and the birth date and number of pups recorded. Ten-week-oldSod1 +/+ and Sod1 −/−mice were used for exposure to >99% oxygen in several Plexiglas chambers. The oxygen concentration varied less than 2%, and CO2 concentration was maintained at less than 0.5% by providing approximately 12 complete gas changes per h. During the exposure, food and water were provided ad libitum, and the animals were kept in a 12-h on, 12-h off light cycle at all times. The numbers of surviving animals were counted three times each day. One-way analysis of variance was used to examine differences in each measurement performed on wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous knock-out mice. If a significant difference was observed (p < 0.05), then pairwise comparisons among mice were made using Duncan's test. Fecundity indices of mice were analyzed by one-sided Fisher's exact test. Survival of wild-type and knock-out mice exposed to >99% oxygen or following intraperitoneal administration of paraquat at 10 mg/kg body weight was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. As shown in Fig. 1 a, exon 5 of the mouse Sod1 gene (which encodes the C-terminal of the protein from amino acid residues 120–154 that constitute both the structure and function of the active site channel (28Fisher C.L. Hallewell R.A. Roberts V.A. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1991; 12–13: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)) and some of the flanking intron sequences were replaced by a neomycin resistance cassette (neo). Insertion of the neo in the mouseSod1 gene creates a new PstI restriction site, resulting in a shorter PstI genomic fragment from the targeted allele (∼12.5 kb) than that from the wild-type allele (∼16.5 kb). Mice heterozygous (Sod1 +/−) for the targeted allele were interbred to generate homozygous knock-out (Sod1 −/−) mice. An example of DNA blot analysis of mouse DNA is shown in Fig. 1 b. In addition to the ∼16.5-kb wild-type and the ∼12.5-kb targeted genomic fragments, the 5′ external probe containing exon 1 sequence also hybridized with aPstI fragment of 6.6 kb. This is believed to result from cross-hybridization between the probe and the mouse Sod1pseudogene(s) (29Danciger E. Dafni N. Bernstein Y. Laver-Rudich Z. Neer A. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3619-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the functional mouse Sod1 gene by gene targeting was then demonstrated by expression study. RNA blot analysis revealed an approximate 40–60% reduction of Sod1 mRNA in tissues of Sod1 +/− mice compared with that of wild-type (Sod1 +/+) mice (Fig. 1 c). Furthermore, no CuZn-SOD mRNA could be found in the tissues from Sod1 −/− mice, indicating that the truncated CuZn-SOD or CuZn-SOD-neo fusion mRNA was degraded rapidly in these tissues. Reduction of CuZn-SOD activity in tissues of Sod1 +/− and Sod1 −/−mice was also confirmed by activity staining on a native polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1 d) and the enzyme assay (Table I). It should be noted that whereas no CuZn-SOD activities were found in brain and liver of Sod1 −/− mice, a very low level of CuZn-SOD activity was present in the lung samples. This activity presumably represents the activity of extracellular superoxide dismutase, as expression of this SOD isoform is relatively high in the lungs compared with other tissues (30Marklund S.L. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). A decrease in CuZn-SOD activity apparently had no effect on the activity of other cellular antioxidant enzymes such as manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) (Fig. 1 d and Table I), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase and the enzymes that participate in the recycling of oxidized glutathione including glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in these tissues from Sod1 +/+,Sod1 +/−, and Sod1 −/−mice (data not shown).Table ISOD activities in tissues of Sod1+/+, Sod1+/−, and Sod1−/− mice.EnzymeSod1genotypeBrainLiverLungCuZn-SOD+/+23.0 ± 5.461.2 ± 15.921.9 ± 1.7+/−10.7 ± 1.21-2001p < 0.01 when comparing +/+ and +/− mice.28.5 ± 4.51-bp < 0.001 when comparing +/+ and +/− mice.11.4 ± 1.31-2003p < 0.0001 when comparing +/+ and +/− mice.−/−NA1-dp < 0.0001 when comparing +/+ and −/− mice, or +/−, and −/− mice.NA1-dp < 0.0001 when comparing +/+ and −/− mice, or +/−, and −/− mice.0.6 ± 0.41-dp < 0.0001 when comparing +/+ and −/− mice, or +/−, and −/− mice.Mn-SOD+/+11.3 ± 3.113.0 ± 2.79.4 ± 0.9+/−11.1 ± 2.212.9 ± 3.19.5 ± 1.3−/−11.4 ± 1.411.5 ± 1.38.3 ± 1.11-2001 p < 0.01 when comparing +/+ and +/− mice.1-b p < 0.001 when comparing +/+ and +/− mice.1-2003 p < 0.0001 when comparing +/+ and +/− mice.1-d p < 0.0001 when comparing +/+ and −/− mice, or +/−, and −/− mice. Open table in a new tab The ratio of the three Sod1genotypes of mouse progeny obtained from interbreeding of Sod1 +/− mice was in agreement with Mendelian inheritance, indicating that there was no lethality in development of Sod1 −/− mice. Male and femaleSod1 −/− mice grew normally and were apparently healthy upon observation to 16 months of age. Histologic survey at the light microscopic level performed on fiveSod1 −/− mice at 4.5 months of age showed no evidence for abnormalities in various tissues including the brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, testis, uterus, and ovary (data not shown). Since CuZn-SOD is highly expressed in erythrocytes (31McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is believed to play a protective role against the superoxide-mediated damage in these cells, a survey of hematologic profile was performed to assess the effect of CuZn-SOD deficiency on homeostasis of these cells. No differences were found in the numbers of red cells, reticulocytes, and differential leukocyte counts including lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and platelets of Sod1 +/+, Sod1 +/−, or Sod1 −/− mice (data not shown). Since the protective role of CuZn-SOD against hyperoxia has been implicated in earlier studies on rats and CuZn-SOD transgenic mice (32Crapo J.D. Barry B.E. Foscue H.A. Shelburne J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1980; 122: 123-143PubMed Google Scholar,33White C.W. Avraham K.B. Shanley P.F. Groner Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 2162-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we next determined whether a deficiency in pulmonary CuZn-SOD activity would render animals more susceptible to hyperoxic exposure. As shown in Fig. 2 a, a virtually identical survival curve with a median survival time of 3.4 ± 0.1 (± S.E.) days was found in bothSod1 +/+ and Sod1 −/−mice, indicating that the function of this enzyme in lung defense against the damage from increased production of superoxide anion radicals during hyperoxia is very limited. However, the Sod1 −/− mice were extremely sensitive to paraquat at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight with a median survival time of 1.4 ± 0.3 (S.E.) days (Fig. 2 b, p< 0.0001 compared with Sod1 +/+ or Sod1 +/− mice). Remarkably, the Sod1 −/− mice became listless at about 30 min after intraperitoneal administration of paraquat, whileSod1 +/+ and Sod1 +/− mice were phenotypically normal even at the end of 7 days of observation. During the study, we intended to generate a large number of Sod1 −/− mice for various pathologic and physiologic studies by interbreeding betweenSod1 −/− mice. To our surprise, the reproductive performance of female Sod1 −/−mice was inferior to that of female Sod1 +/−mice. As shown in Table II, while 10 female Sod1 +/− mice gave birth to 26 litters (mean litter size 7.5 ± 2.5) in a period of 3 months, only 16 litters (mean litter size 1.6 ± 1.0) were yielded from an equal number of Sod1 −/− female mice. Of these 16 litters, 6 litters contained only 1 pup, 3 litters contained 2 pups, and one litter contained 4 pups. It should be noted that the drastic reduction in reproduction of Sod1 −/− females is not a result of a defect in the development of Sod1 −/− fetuses, since of the 194 pups derived from the breeding between Sod1 +/− female and Sod1 −/− male mice, 52% were heterozygous and 48% homozygous for the targeted Sod1 allele.Table IINumber of progeny produced from breeding of female Sod1 knock-out miceSod1 genotypeNumber of littersTotal number of pupsLitter size2-2001Numbers are means ± S.D.MaleFemale−/−+/−261947.5 ± 2.5−/−−/−10161.6 ± 1.02-bp < 0.001 when comparing to +/− female mice.2-2001 Numbers are means ± S.D.2-b p < 0.001 when comparing to +/− female mice. Open table in a new tab To understand further this unexpected observation, the reproductive performance of the female mice with three Sod1 genotypes was closely followed. As shown in Table III, male Sod1 −/− mice were as fertile asSod1 +/+ males, and femaleSod1 +/+ and Sod1 +/− mice were similarly fertile when bred with eitherSod1 +/+ or Sod1 −/− male mice. However, the fecundity index (number of litters/number of copulations) and size of the litters of Sod1 −/− females were much less than those of Sod1 +/+ and Sod1 +/−females.Table IIIReproductive performance of Sod1+/+, Sod1+/−, and Sod1−/− female mice in breeding with Sod1+/+ and Sod1−/− male miceSod1genotypeNumber of pups from each copulationFecundity index3-2001Fecundity index = number of litters/number of copulations × 100.Litter size3-bNumbers are means ± S.D.MaleFemale+/++/+11, 9, 9, 9, 8, 7, 7, 6, 5, 41007.5 ± 2.1+/++/−9, 9, 7, 7, 7, 6, 5, 5, 5, 0906.7 ± 1.6+/+−/−5, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0363-2003p < 0.05 when comparing −/− females to +/+ or +/− females bred with either +/+ or +/− males.3.0 ± 1.63-dp < 0.01 when comparing −/− females to +/+ or +/− females bred with either +/+ or +/− males.−/−+/+11, 10, 9, 8, 8, 7, 7, 0888.6 ± 1.5−/−+/−14, 11, 11, 9, 9, 8, 8, 7, 5, 21008.4 ± 3.3−/−−/−3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0363-2003p < 0.05 when comparing −/− females to +/+ or +/− females bred with either +/+ or +/− males.1.5 ± 1.03-dp < 0.01 when comparing −/− females to +/+ or +/− females bred with either +/+ or +/− males.3-2001 Fecundity index = number of litters/number of copulations × 100.3-b Numbers are means ± S.D.3-2003 p < 0.05 when comparing −/− females to +/+ or +/− females bred with either +/+ or +/− males.3-d p < 0.01 when comparing −/− females to +/+ or +/− females bred with either +/+ or +/− males. Open table in a new tab The mechanism underlying the poor reproductive performance of Sod1 −/− females was further investigated. Examination of vaginal smears indicated that all types of mice had similar estrous cycles, with an average length of 4 to 5 days. The frequency of female mice that became receptive to males was also measured. For 6 weeks, eight Sod1 +/+,Sod1 +/−, and Sod1 −/−female mice mated 17, 20, and 18 times with vasectomized males, respectively. Apparently, the reduced fertility in Sod1 −/− mice was not a result of altered estrous cycles. The numbers of ova ovulated by these three types of females at each estrous cycle were also found to be equivalent (Table IV). In addition, femaleSod1 −/− mice exhibited a normal ovarian histology including the number, size, or morphology of antral follicles and corpora lutea compared with that of Sod1 +/+and Sod1 +/− mice (data not shown). These results suggested that the reduced fertility in Sod1 −/− female mice might result from a defect in implantation of embryos to the wall of the uterine horns or premature death of the fetuses.Table IVNumber of ova produced by female Sod1+/+,Sod1+/−, and Sod1−/− mice at each estrous cycleSod1 genotypeNumber of ova per cycleAverage number of ova4-2001Numbers are means ± S.D.+/+9, 6, 10, 7, 8, 88.0 ± 1.4+/−8, 5, 6, 7, 7, 97.0 ± 1.4−/−5, 4, 8, 10, 7, 9, 9, 97.6 ± 2.14-2001 Numbers are means ± S.D. Open table in a new tab To evaluate further these two possibilities, we then examined the number and viability of fetuses in Sod1 −/−female mice bred with Sod1 −/− male mice between 10.5 and 14.5 days postcoitum. As shown in Table V, of 15 mice examined, only 2 of them were not pregnant. However, 75 of 91 implanted embryos in a variety of sizes were found dead and in the process of being resorbed. Compared with the normal 12.5-day fetuses, most of those dead and resorbed embryos were loosely attached to the wall of the uterine horns without a developed placenta or yolk sac (data not shown). Judging from the sizes of these embryos, embryonic death might have occurred at various times before 10 days of pregnancy. In control experiments, 14 of 15 female Sod1 +/− mice were pregnant from breeding with Sod1 −/− males. A total of 122 implanted embryos was found, and of them only 9 were dead. Although the average number of successfully implanted embryos in Sod1 −/− females (6.3 ± 4.4), including both the live and dead ones, was less than that in Sod1 +/− females (8.2 ± 3.0), the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.2). These results indicated that the efficiency of embryo implantation in the former mice was equivalent to that in the latter mice. However, the rate of post-implantation embryonic death that occurred in Sod1 −/− females was significantly higher than that in Sod1 +/− females (83 ± 23%versus 7.0 ± 7.0%, respectively; p < 0.0001).Table VPost-implantation embryonic lethality in female Sod1+/− and Sod1−/− mice in breeding with male Sod1−/− miceSod1 genotypeNumber of pregnancies/number of copulationsTotal number of implanted embryosAverage number of implanted embryosTotal number of dead embryosFrequency of embryonic death5-2001Numbers are means ± S.D.+/−14/151228.2 ± 3.097.0 ± 7.0−/−13/15916.3 ± 4.47583 ± 235-bp < 0.0001 when comparing to +/− female mice.5-2001 Numbers are means ± S.D.5-b p < 0.0001 when comparing to +/− female mice. Open table in a new tab During the course of this study, generation and characterization of a line of mice lacking the entire Sod1 locus have also been reported (34Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown R.H. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Although we inactivated the Sod1 gene by a different approach, our results on the apparently normal phenotype of the Sod1 −/− mice are in agreement with those reported previously. However, our study has focused on some other antioxidant functions of this enzyme that were not described previously (34Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F.

Our data reveal that although the role of CuZn-SOD in defending lungs against lethal exposure of hyperoxia is negligible, it is essential in protecting animals against paraquat toxicity. These data indicate that the protective role of CuZn-SOD is dependent on the cellular site of oxygen radical generation. The mitochondrion is known to be a major subcellular site producing oxygen radicals under normal physiologic conditions (for review, see Ref. 1Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D. Lab. Invest. 1982; 47: 412-426PubMed Google Scholar), and the rate of radical production is further enhanced in mitochondria of hyperoxic lungs (35Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10986-10992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Turrens J.F. Freeman B.A. Levitt J.G. Crapo J.D. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 1982; 217: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This understanding and our results suggest that Mn-SOD may play a more critical role than does CuZn-SOD in antioxidant defense mechanism(s) under normal physiologic conditions, and in defending against lung injury resulting from hyperoxic insults. This notion is supported by the recent findings that mice lacking Mn-SOD die at very young ages (38Li Y. Huang T.-T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar, 39Lebovitz R.M. Zhang H. Vogel H. Cartwright J. Dionne L. Lu N. Huang S. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9782-9787Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). However, CuZn-SOD is apparently critical for animals to survive under a lethal exposure to paraquat, a bipyridyl herbicide capable of generating oxygen radicals through the redox cycling mechanism. This reaction is believed to be catalyzed by the enzyme NADPH-dependent cytochrome P-450 reductase, primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Our data suggest that both the cytosolic and microsomal enzymes may be the primary targets of superoxide radicals generated during paraquat toxicity. This conclusion is in agreement with an earlier study reported by Phillips and colleagues (40Phillips J.P. Campbell S.D. Michaud D. Charbonneau M. Hilliker A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) that Drosophila deficient in CuZn-SOD is hypersensitive to paraquat. The most intriguing observation made in this study is the reduced fertility of female mice lacking this enzyme. Apparently, this defect is associated with CuZn-SOD deficiency in the female mice and unrelated to the Sod1 genotypes of the fetuses. Since the femaleSod1 −/− mice exhibited a normal estrous cycle and generated comparable numbers of ova compared with those of Sod1 +/+ and Sod1 +/−females, the reduced fertility might not have been a result of a gross defect in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in these mice. However, post-implantation embryonic loss did occur, and this could certainly be endocrine-related. Interestingly, male CuZn-SOD-deficient fruit flies are sterile, and females show a markedly reduced fertility (40Phillips J.P. Campbell S.D. Michaud D. Charbonneau M. Hilliker A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). These and our results suggest that CuZn-SOD plays a critical role in female reproduction. The exact mechanism(s) underlying the observed reduced fertility in female CuZn-SOD-deficient mice as well as its implication in human reproductive dysfunction remain to be defined.

https://openalex.org/W2010184495,"The assembly of contractile proteins into organized sarcomeric units is one of the most distinctive features of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. In a well characterized in vitro model system using cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, a subset of G protein-coupled receptor agonists has been shown to induce actin-myosin filament organization. Pretreatment of myocytes with C3 exoenzyme ADP-ribosylated Rho and inhibited the characteristic α1-adrenergic receptor agonist-induced myofibrillar organization, suggesting involvement of the Rho GTPase in cardiac myofibrillogenesis. We used adenoviral mediated gene transfer to examine the effects of activated Rho and inhibitory mutants of one of its effectors, Rho kinase, in myocytes. Rho immunoreactivity was increased in the particulate fraction of myocytes infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing constitutively activated Rho. Rho-infected cells demonstrated a striking increase in the assembly and organization of sarcomeric units and in the expression of the atrial natriuretic factor protein. These Rho-induced responses were markedly inhibited by co-infection with adenoviruses expressing putative dominant negative forms of Rho kinase. A parallel pathway involving Ras-induced myofibrillar organization and atrial natriuretic factor expression was only minimally affected. α1-Adrenergic receptor agonist-induced myofibrillogenesis was inhibited by some but not all of the Rho kinase mutants. Our data demonstrate that activated Rho has profound effects on myofibrillar organization in cardiac myocytes and suggest that Rho kinase mediates Rho-induced hypertrophic responses."

https://openalex.org/W2063717885,"We have previously shown that the PLAG1 gene on chromosome 8q12 is consistently rearranged in pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary glands with t(3;8)(p21;q12) translocations. The t(3;8) results in promoter swapping between the PLAG1 gene, which encodes a novel zinc finger protein, and the constitutively expressed gene for beta-catenin (CTNNB1), a protein with roles in cell-cell adhesion and the WG/WNT signalling pathway. In order to assess the importance of other translocation partner genes of PLAG1, and their possible relationship to CTNNB1, we have characterized a second recurrent translocation, i.e. the t(5;8)(p13;q12). This translocation leads to ectopic expression of a chimeric transcript consisting of sequences from the ubiquitously expressed gene for the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and PLAG1. As for the t(3;8), the fusions occurred in the 5'-noncoding regions of both genes, exchanging regulatory control elements while preserving the coding sequences. The results of the current as well as previous studies indicate that ectopic expression of PLAG1 under the control of promoters of distinct translocation partner genes is a general pathogenetic mechanism for pleomorphic adenomas with 8q12 aberrations."

Five of these genes have not previously been reported to exhibit increased expression in this disease: cathepsin S, the C1q B-chain of complement, apolipoprotein D, and two previously unidentified genes denominated scrapie-responsive gene (ScRG)-1 and ScRG-2, which are preferentially expressed in brain tissue.

The work presented herein together with certain previous reports (18Campbell I.L. Eddleston M. Kemper P. Oldstone M.B.A. Hobbs M.V. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2383-2387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Williams A. Van Dam A.M. Lucassen P.J. Ritchie D. Court L. Dodet B. Transmissible Subacute Spongiform Encephalopathies: Prion Diseases.

Nature. 1996; 380: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) raises the question of whether the continuous and widespread activation of glial cells, a host response most probably designed for more local, limited, or transitory injuries of the brain, may be more detrimental than beneficial to neuron survival in TSE. Such a hypothesis is supported by in vitro studies of the neurotoxicity of PrP-related peptides, the results of which show that neuronal death is mediated by activated microglial cells (23Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Moreover, reactive astrocytosis has been reported to accompany neuronal degeneration in brains of mice with cerebral overexpression of the interleukin-6 gene (24Castelnau P.A. Campbell I.L. Powell H.C. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 234: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To identify those genes the altered expression of which is associated with or may even be responsible for the neurodegenerative changes observed in TSE, we have systematically analyzed modifications of gene expression in scrapie-infected mouse brain using the mRNA differential display screen described by Liang and Pardee (25Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4694) Google Scholar) and Liang et al. (26Liang P. Zhu W. Zhang X. Guo Z. O'Connell R.P. Averboukh L. Wang F. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5763-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This approach has led to the detection of an increased level of expression of eight cellular genes and the slight decreased expression of one other gene. Five of these genes have not previously been reported to be enhanced in scrapie. Indeed, two are previously unrecognized genes that are specifically expressed in brain tissue. The three others encode cathepsin S, the C1q B-chain of complement, and apolipoprotein D. The increased expression of cathepsin S, a cysteine-protease produced by cells of monocytic/macrophage lineage that is secreted and which retains activity at neutral pH (27Petanceska S. Canoll P. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4403-4409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), together with the possible activation of a component of the cytotoxic complement pathway suggest that some pathological lesions observed in scrapie may result directly from microglial products. Fifty-three C57Bl/6 mice (Charles River, France) were inoculated intracerebrally with 20 μl of a 1% brain homogenate of C506M3 seventh passage scrapie agent (a gift from Dr. D. C. Gajdusek, NIH, Bethesda, MD) (19Lazarini F. Boussin F. Deslys J.-P. Tardy M. Dormont D. J. Comp. Pathol. 1994; 111: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Eighteen control mice were inoculated with the same volume of 1% normal brain homogenate. Scrapie-inoculated and control animals were killed by cervical column disruption on days 2, 45, 88, 120, 150 and in the late clinical stages of the disease at days 165, 171, 175, or 184 post-infection. The brains were split, and each hemisphere was frozen directly in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Only the hemispheres opposite the site of inoculation were further used for RNA extraction. The C6 rat glioma cell line was a gift from Dr. J. J. Hauw (Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France). The murine neuroblastoma cells N2A and NIE-115 were a gift from Dr. G. Barbin (Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France). All the cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, except for the PC12 cell line derived from a rat pheochromocytoma, which was supplemented with 5% horse serum and 10% fetal calf serum. Total cellular RNA was isolated from (a) control and scrapie-infected mouse brains, (b) various normal mouse organs, and (c) the C6, N2A, NlE-115, and PC12 cell lines using the method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA from animals in late clinical stages of disease was obtained after one cycle of affinity chromatography of total brain RNA on oligo(dT) cellulose columns. Northern blots were performed using glyoxal denaturation according to standard protocols, and the blots were hybridized as described by Church and Gilbert (29Church G. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar) using probes radiolabeled to a specific activity of at least 1 × 109 cpm/μg using the Megaprime DNA labeling systems kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The blots were first exposed to autoradiography and then submitted to quantification using PhosphorImager. The procedure employed was based on the use of the “MessageClean” and the “RNAimage” kits of GenHunter Corp. and was essentially the same as that described by the manufacturer, with minor modifications. Briefly, RNA was treated with a RNase-free DNase, and 1 μg was reverse-transcribed in 100 μl of reaction buffer using either one or the other of the three one-base-anchored oligo(dT) primers, (HT11) A, C, or G. All the samples to be compared were reverse-transcribed in the same experiment, separated into aliquots, and frozen. The amplification was performed with only 1 μl of the reverse transcription sample/reaction in 10 μl of amplification mixture containing the Taq DNA polymerase and [α-33P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmole). Eighty 5′ end (HAP) primers were used in combination with each of the three (HT11) A, C, or G primers. Samples were then run on 7% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and exposed to autoradiography. Bands of interest were cut out, reamplified according to the instructions of the supplier, and further used as probes to hybridize Northern blots. Reamplified bands from the differential display screen were cloned in the Sfr1 site of the pCR-Script SK(+) plasmid (Stratagene), and cDNA amplified from the rapid amplification of cDNA ends were isolated by TA cloning in the pCR3 plasmid (Invitrogen). DNA was sequenced using the Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit (Amersham). One μg of poly(A)+ RNA from scrapie-infected mice (171 days) was reverse-transcribed, processed according to the instruction of the marathon amplification procedure (CLONTECH), and amplified with a reverse primer specific for extension of the differential display cDNA fragment numbered 7322 (5′-GTGAAGGCCTTCAGGACCATGTTCTCC-3′). The amplified cDNA was run on a 1% agarose gel; longer molecules were isolated by electroelution and cloned into plasmid pCR3 (Invitrogen). Relevant cDNA molecules were then targeted by colony filter hybridization with a radiolabeled primer (5′-AGTGCAAGGCAGATCCTCAG-3′) designed from the sequence of the 7322 band upstream of the primer used for the amplification (see Fig. 4). To identify mRNA species, the expression of which was increased in scrapie-infected mouse brain, we used the mRNA differential display (DD) strategy (25Liang P. Pardee A.B.

C57Bl/6 mice were inoculated intracerebrally with scrapie strain C506M3, and brains were harvested at different times post-inoculation corresponding to different stages of the disease: 45 days, PrPSc is barely detectable; 88 days, PrPSc is clearly detectable; 120 days, gliosis had occurred, and increased GFAP mRNA was observed in astrocytes; 150 days, the first clinical signs of the disease appeared; and between 165–184 days, the terminal stage of the disease, with neurodegeneration and spongiosis, occurred (19Lazarini F. Boussin F. Deslys J.-P. Tardy M. Dormont D. J. Comp. Pathol. 1994; 111: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Lazarini F. Deslys J.-P. Dormont D. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1645-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Brain RNA from scrapie-infected and control mice were submitted to reverse transcription with either one or the other of the three (HT11) A-, C-, or G-anchored primers. The cDNA obtained was amplified by PCR with the oligo(dT) used previously and a second primer arbitrary in sequence (HAP), and size-fractionated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1 A). To minimize false positives, one sample of control brain RNA (lane C) and four separate samples of scrapie-infected brain RNA from mice sacrificed on days 2, 120, 150, and 171 (lanes 2, 120,150, and 171) were simultaneously compared in the DD screen. For each primer combination used, about 100 cDNA bands can be visualized per RNA sample. We performed 240 PCR amplifications using different primer combinations, and we examined the intensity of some 24,000 bands obtained for each sample. As expected, the majority of the cDNA bands from scrapie-infected samples were similar in intensity to those of the control, whereas some bands exhibited an increased abundance either at the late clinical stage of the disease (Fig. 1 A, star) or simultaneously at days 120, 150, and 171 post-inoculation (Fig. 1 A, arrow). After confirmation of the putative difference by displaying the samples for a second time, candidate cDNA was recovered from the polyacrylamide gel, PCR-amplified, and used to probe a Northern blot containing total control and scrapie-infected brain RNA. For example, the two cDNA indicated with a star in Fig. 1 A were found to represent the same mRNA species, the abundance of which is markedly increased in the brain of mice with clinical signs of scrapie (Fig. 1 B, lane 171). This RNA was shown to code for metallothionein II, a gene previously identified as overexpressed in scrapie (11Duguid J.R. Rohwer R.G. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5738-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In contrast, the other cDNA selected (indicated by the arrow in Fig. 1 A) revealed a mRNA that was present in greater amounts from 120 to 171 days post-inoculation (Fig. 1 B, lanes 120, 150, and 171). Seventy-two differently expressed candidate bands were isolated using the screen and further studied using Northern blot analysis. Twelve of the bands hybridized more strongly with RNA from scrapie-infected mouse brain and correspond to eight distinct genes whose transcripts are significantly increased during scrapie (one of these genes was represented three times in the screen, and two other genes were represented twice). Five of the genes identified using the DD screen have not been reported to exhibit altered expression during scrapie infection. Cloning and sequencing of the corresponding DD cDNA fragments revealed that the nucleic acid sequence of two of these genes was unknown in the data bases. The three remaining genes were identified as the C1q B-chain of complement, apolipoprotein D, and a gene closely related to rat cathepsin S (Table I).Table IIdentification of genes with modulated expression in the brain of scrapie-infected miceDD cDNA fragmentIdentificationmRNA sizemRNA changeScrapie/controlkbDays post-inoculation-fold increased7233/7321Cathepsin S1.51203–87411Complement C1q-B1.01204–57322ScRG-10.71202–3554/10261Apolipoprotein D0.9165–1715–810722ScRG-2 (unknown)2.9 /3.2165–1713–41432ScRG-3 (unknown)6.4165–17120–30% decreased7641β2 microglobulin0.912037801F4/803.2120ND1-2001Not done.131/122/132Metallothionein II0.45150–16571-2001 Not done. Open table in a new tab Northern blot analysis with the first unidentified DD cDNA (7322 cDNA), 197 bp in length, led to the identification of a 0.7-kb transcript (denominated scrapie-responsive gene 1 (ScRG-1) that is overexpressed 2–3-fold from 120 days post-inoculation to 171 days in scrapie-infected brain relative to normal mouse brain (Figs.1 B and 2 A and Table I). Increased expression of GFAP mRNA, a marker for astrocytosis (19, 30; Fig. 2 A) has previously been reported to occur during the same time period. The use of the 7322 cDNA as a probe revealed the presence of an additional 2.5-kb mRNA, expressed at very low levels in control brain (10% of the expression observed for the 0.7-kb message), which was also overexpressed in scrapie-infected brain. A quantitative evaluation of the degree of enhancement was difficult due to the low level of expression of the larger mRNA species (data not shown). RNA blot analysis with the second unknown DD cDNA (10722 cDNA) 245 bp in length revealed two mRNA species, 3.2 and 2.9 kb in length, denominated ScRG-2, that are increased 3–4-fold in the scrapie-infected brain at the terminal stage of the disease compared with brain from control animals (Fig. 2 B and Table I). The 10722 cDNA sequence represents the 3′ end of the ScRG-2 mRNA . The third cDNA (7233 DD cDNA, Table I) encodes the C-terminal region of the mouse cathepsin S protein. This 366-bp fragment was sequenced (EMBL accession number AJ223208), and translation of the nucleic acid sequence (3–137) gives rise to a 45-amino acid partial protein sequence identical to the C-terminal sequence of rat cathepsin S except for one conservative amino acid substitution. Furthermore the 3′-noncoding sequence of the 7233 cDNA fragment also exhibits strong homology with the corresponding sequence of the rat gene. As shown in Fig. 2 A, this mouse cathepsin S cDNA detected a 1.5-kb message that is more abundant in the scrapie-infected brain from 120 to 171 days post-inoculation than in the brain of control animals or in the brain of scrapie-infected animals during the first three months of the disease. A 2.2-fold increase in the cathepsin S mRNA is observed between 120 and 150 days post-infection, but the level of expression continues to increase toward the terminal stage of the disease (3–8-fold increase, depending upon the individual animal) (Table I). The fourth cDNA (7411 DD cDNA, Table I) corresponds to the C1q B-chain of the complement (Table I). Brains from scrapie-infected mice exhibited a 2.5-fold higher level of complement C1q B-chain mRNA than control animals at 120 days and a 4–5-fold increase at the terminal stage of the disease (Fig. 2 B, Table I). The last cDNA (554 DD cDNA, Table I) corresponding to a mRNA, the expression of which has been shown for the first time to be increased during scrapie infection, encodes apolipoprotein D. The expression of apolipoprotein D mRNA was found to be increased 5–7-fold during the terminal stage of the disease (Fig. 2 A, Table I). The three other genes identified with the DD screen, metallothionein II (Table I, Fig. 1), β2 microglobulin (Table I, Fig. 2 B), and F4/80 (Table I) had already been reported to exhibit increased expression in scrapie-infected brain (11Duguid J.R. Rohwer R.G. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5738-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 13Duguid J.R. Dinauer M.C.

Transmissible Subacute Spongiform Encephalopathies: Prion Diseases. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., Paris1996: 167-171Google Scholar). To determine whether changes in the expression of ScRG-1, cathepsin S, the C1qB-chain of complement, and β2 microglobulin mRNA occur before 120 days post-infection at least in some mice, we examined two scrapie-infected mice at 88 days post-infection in addition to the animal in which the results are shown in Fig. 2. No increase in the expression of the four genes was detected at this stage of infection compared with the control samples (data not shown). The DD screen also led to the identification of a cDNA corresponding to a mRNA, the abundance of which is decreased in scrapie-infected mouse brain. The sequence (EMBL accession number AJ223207) of the 235-bp cDNA fragment (1432 cDNA, Table I) was not present in the nucleic acid sequence data bases. This cDNA, when used to probe a Northern blot, revealed a 6.4-kb mRNA (denominated ScRG-3), the abundance of which at the terminal stage of infection is only 70–80% of that observed in the brains of control animals. Although the decrease was weak, it was consistently observed in four mice with clinical scrapie compared with five controls and six scrapie-infected mice examined at either 45 or 88 days post-inoculation (Table I and data not shown). Finally, as described previously (30Lazarini F. Deslys J.-P. Dormont D. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1645-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the level of the PrP mRNA was not altered in mouse brain by scrapie infection (Fig. 2 A) and as actin, can be used as an internal control of the amount of RNA loaded on the blots (31Dron M. Modjtahedi N. Brison O. Tovey M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We characterized the pattern of tissue expression of the three previously unidentified genes, ScRG-1,ScRG-2, and ScRG-3, by examining the relative levels of the different mRNAs present in different adult mouse tissues (Fig. 3 A). ScRG-1 and ScRG-2 transcripts of 0.7 kb and 2.9/3.2 kb, respectively, were detected only in the brain even after overexposure of the autoradiography of the Northern blots examined; expression of these two genes could not be detected in the lung, heart, thymus, liver, kidney, and spleen either in the size range expected or elsewhere on the blot (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). In contrast, the third previously unidentified gene, ScRG-3, whose transcription products are decreased in scrapie-infected brain (Table I), was expressed as a 6.4-kb transcript in all the organs examined (Fig. 3 A). This broad tissue distribution was also observed for the cathepsin S 1.5-kb mRNA (Fig. 3 A), but the expression pattern of cathepsin S was different in relative intensity from the ScRG-3 pattern. The transcripts for cathepsin S showed marked variations in the levels of expression in different tissues. The highest levels were observed in brain, lung, thymus, and spleen, whereas much lower levels of cathepsin S transcripts were observed in the heart, liver, and kidney (Fig. 3 A). These results are consistent with previous reports concerning rat and mouse cathepsin S expression (32Qian F. Bajkowski A.S. Steiner D.S. Chan S.J. Frankfater A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4870-4875PubMed Google Scholar, 33Petanceska S. Devi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26038-26043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast,ScRG-3 was expressed with relatively small variations between the organs examined. For example, in the liver and kidney,ScRG-3 was expressed in levels comparable to actin levels, whereas cathepsin S mRNA was at the lowest levels detected (Fig. 3 A). The virtually uniform distribution of ScRG-3expression in different tissues suggests a housekeeping function for this gene. We have identified two unknown genes, ScRG-1 and ScRG-2, the mRNA of which are increased in scrapie-infected mouse brain and that are preferentially expressed in brain tissue (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 A). We decided to further investigate ScRG-1because the change in the mRNA content of this gene occurred the earliest throughout the course of scrapie infection (Fig. 2). The ScRG-1 cDNA fragment isolated with the DD screen was only 197 bp in length and represented the 3′ end of the mRNA. To generate cDNA molecules extending to the 5′ end of the message, we performed a 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR with a specific reverse primer derived from within the 5′ half of the sequence of the 7322 DD band. The amplified cDNA was cloned and screened by colony hybridization using a 20-mer probe corresponding to the 5′ end of the 7322 band (Fig. 4 A). We sequenced the ScRG-1 cDNA present in three positive clones numbered 15, 16, and 24. The inserts of clones 16 and 24 were identical with one exception, a nucleotide that extends the insert of clone 24 at the 5′ terminus. The sequence of clone 15 cDNA was shorter by 145 nucleotides at its 5′ end than that of the two other cDNA and was found to be identical to them for the remaining region with one exception, a T (clones 16 and 24) change to a C (clone 15) substitution at position 481 of clone 24 cDNA. The full sequence of ScRG-1 cDNA given in Fig. 4 B is the sequence of the insert of clone 24 extended in 3′ by the additional sequence determined from the DD band. The size of the the full-length cDNA is in perfect agreement with our previous determination of the ScRG-1 mRNA size on Northern blot (700 bp), and two polyadenylation signals are present at its 3′ end, one at position 639 and the other at position 681. ScRG-1 mRNA sequence does not exhibit significant homology with any other reported sequence in the data bases. The longest open reading frame in the message begins at position 217, the position of the first AUG seen in this mRNA, and terminates at position 360. This hypothetical open reading frame would code for a small 47-amino acid protein (Fig. 4 B) with a hydrophobic N-terminal region. We applied the method of von Heijne (34von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar) for identifying a putative N-terminal signal sequence and for predicting the site of cleavage. The results obtained suggest the existence of such a cleavabl"

The encoded protein, Merlin, is closely related to the Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin family of membrane/cytoskeletal linker proteins. Examination of Merlin in several cell lines revealed that the protein migrates as two distinct species near 70 kDa. Phosphatase treatment and orthophosphate labeling demonstrated that the species with decreased mobility is phosphorylated. Given Merlin's localization to cortical actin structures, we examined the effect of cell-cell contact or other forms of growth arrest on Merlin expression and post-translational modification. Under conditions of confluency or serum deprivation, the levels of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Merlin species increased significantly. Cells arrested in G1 by other methods or other phases of the cell cycle did not show changes in Merlin levels. Furthermore, loss of adhesion resulted in a nearly complete dephosphorylation of Merlin, which was reversed upon re-plating of cells, suggesting Merlin phosphorylation may be responsive to cell spreading or changes in cell shape. Thus, the tumor suppressor function of Merlin may involve the regulation of cellular responses to cues such as cell-cell contact, growth factor microenvironment, or changes in cell shape.

Genetic mapping and positional cloning led to the identification of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene, which was shown to be mutated in the germ line of NF2 patients and in sporadically occurring tumors of the type associated with the disease (2Gusella J.M.

The NF2-encoded protein is most similar to three closely related genes in this family, Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin (the “ERMs”) and was hence dubbed Merlin for moesin, ezrin,radixin-like protein. Merlin is most similar to the ERMs in its N-terminal half (e.g. 61% identity to Ezrin), whereas the C-terminal half of the protein shares only 24% identity with the other members of this subfamily.NF2 is transcribed at moderate levels in most human and mouse tissues and is highly expressed in the mouse fetal brain (3Rouleau G.A.

McClatchey, unpublished observations Several members of the band 4.1 superfamily, including the ERM proteins, are thought to serve as membrane-cytoskeletal linkers. Band 4.1 itself is a major component of the erythrocyte undercoat and binds to the integral membrane protein glycophorin C through its N-terminal domain and to actin via spectrin with the C-terminal domain (7Luna E.J. Hitt A.L. Science. 1992; 258: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). All three of the ERM proteins localize similarly to cortical actin structures near the plasma membrane such as microvilli, membrane ruffles, and lamellipodia (8Amieva M. Furthmayr H. Exp.

The proposed actin-binding domain is highly conserved among the ERM proteins, but, importantly, it is not apparent in Merlin. Furthermore, it not known whether Merlin can bind any of the known ERM interactors nor have any novel Merlin binding partners been identified yet. Depletion of ERM proteins by antisense oligonucleotide treatment, as well as experiments overexpressing Ezrin in insect cells, suggests a role for ERM proteins in regulating cell-substratum and cell-cell adhesion (17Takeuchi K.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 73-84PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, studies of ERM proteins suggest they may serve to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton in response to growth factors (20Bretscher A. J.

Jacks, submitted for publication. we were interested in whether Merlin may be involved in responding to cell-cell contact, loss of substrate attachment, and other growth suppressive signals. Here, we examine the expression of Merlin under such conditions and find the protein is regulated in multiple ways during cellular response to microenvironmental changes. NIH3T3 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). U2OS cells (a gift of J. Lees, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) and NRK cells (a gift of R. Hynes, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). For serum starvation of cells, subconfluent cells were placed in 0.5% fetal bovine serum (0.2% calf serum for NIH3T3 cells) for 24 h except where indicated otherwise. For other growth arrest treatments, subconfluent cells in 10% serum were treated with 20 nmstaurosporine, 750 μm hydroxyurea (Sigma) for 24 h, 500 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 24 h, or 500 centigrays γ-irradiation and then placed at 37 °C for 18 h. For confluency experiments, exponentially growing cells were plated at various densities (as noted in figure legends) in fresh medium 24 h before Western lysates were prepared. All cells were cultured in 10-cm tissue culture dishes, and we determined that the saturation density of the NIH3T3 cells used on these dishes was 6 × 106 cells per dish. All cells were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber. Anti-Merlin polyclonal antibodies sc331 and sc332 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Ellen Zwartoff (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands) kindly supplied the 1398 Merlin polyclonal antibody (den Bakker et al. (21den Bakker M.A. Riegman P.H. Hekman R.A. Boersma W. Janssen P.J. van der Kwast T.H. Zwarthoff E.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 757-763PubMed Google Scholar)). All three of these Merlin antisera are anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies directed against unique peptide antigens. sc331, sc332, and 1398 were directed against residues 2–21, 579–579, and 508–533, respectively, of human Merlin. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to Radixin (polyclonal antibody 457) was a generous gift of F. Solomon (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) Anti-src MAb (LA074) was a gift of E. Clark (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). Total cell lysates were obtained by two different methods with the same results observed with each methodology. Cultured cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in PBS containing 2% SDS, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptinin, and pepstatin (51Henry M.D. Gonzalez Agosti C. Solomon F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1007-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); or lysed in boiling 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cells were then scraped with a rubber policeman, boiled for 5 min, and then sheared with a 26-gauge needle three times, and an aliquot was taken for protein concentration determination using the Bio-Rad DC-Kit (Melville, NY) or using the BCA protein determination kit (Pierce) with identical results. Sample buffer (5 ×) was added to the remainder of the sample. For immunoblotting, total cell extracts were separated on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a 4% stack and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). For blotting with anti-Merlin sc331, membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). sc331 was diluted to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml in blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Polyclonal antibody 457 was used as described previously (12Winckler B. Gonzalez Agosti C. Magendantz M. Solomon F. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2523-2534PubMed Google Scholar). Each was washed extensively in TBST followed by probing with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Amersham Corp.) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). For methionine labeling, 1 × 106 cells were plated in a 100-mm dish, and the next day the cells were serum-starved (as described above) for 42 h. Cells were then preincubated with 5 ml of methionine-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 40 min and then labeled for 6 h with 500 μCi of [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products). For orthophosphate labeling, serum-starved cells were preincubated with phosphate-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then incubated for 5 h with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (HCl-free, NEN Life Science Products). Cells were rinsed in PBS and then lysed in a modified RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin). Lysed cells were rocked at 4 °C for 30 min, then scraped and cleared by centrifugation at top speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 15 min. Supernatants were preincubated with irrelevant rabbit IgG in 50% protein A-Sepharose beads (Pierce) at 4 °C for 2 h and then centrifuged for 1 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The resulting supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation with 0.5 μg of sc331 or sc332 antibody (per sample) overnight at 4 °C. 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added and rocked 2 h further at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered by centifugation and washed three times in RIPA buffer; sample buffer was added, and samples were boiled 5 min. Equal number of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts were immunoprecipitated for each sample within a given experiment. Samples were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Cells were trypsinized, washed in media, rinsed in PBS, and fixed with cold 95% ethanol. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 20 μg/ml propidium iodide and 200 μg/ml RNase A in PBS and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and placed at 4 °C overnight. A total of 10,000 cells were analyzed for each arrest sample per experiment. The phosphoamino acid composition was analyzed essentially as described (52Sefton B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 18.3.1-18.3.18Google Scholar). Briefly, [32P]orthophosphate-labeled immunoprecipitates were separated on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride as described. Bands containing32P-labeled Merlin were located by autoradiography, excised, and subjected to direct hydrolysis in 100 μl of 6n HCl at 100 °C for 1 h. Supernatants were lyophilized and resuspended in distilled H20 and spotted onto plastic-backed cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (EM Sciences, Gibbstown, NJ). A mixture of 3 mg/ml phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (Sigma) containing a trace of phenol red was spotted on top of each sample. Two-dimensional high voltage TLC electrophoresis was performed at 1000 V for 20 min each on a Multiphor II (Pharmacia) electrophoretic apparatus. Buffers and visualization of standards were as described (50Shaw R.J. Henry M. Solomon F. Jacks T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 403-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For adhesion assays, confluent NIH3T3 cells were serum-starved in DMEM (0% calf serum) for 18 h, washed with PBS, and trypsinized. Cells were then washed twice in DMEM containing 0.5% soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty acid-free, Sigma) and suspended in DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were plated on fibronectin (Biocoat dishes, Becton Dickinson) or tissue culture plastic plates for 15–60 min, except where otherwise indicated. For cytochalasin D (CCD) experiment, CCD was added to 1 μm in DMEM at the time of plating. Similarly for experiments in presence of serum, calf serum was added to 10% in DMEM at time of plating. All plates were washed with PBS prior to making protein extracts to ensure that only adherent cells were examined. To begin to investigate the expression and post-translational modification of Merlin, we characterized the ability of multiple antisera to recognize endogenous Merlin by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of total cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 1 A, Western blot analysis revealed that in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells the endogenous protein migrated as a distinct doublet around 70 kDa. The identity of these species as Merlin was confirmed by using multiple antisera, cells overexpressing hemagglutinin-tagged Merlin, Nf2-deficient cells derived from tumors from Nf2-heterozygous mutant mice, and ES cells bearing a homozygous disruption of the Nf2 gene (Fig. 1 A; Ref. 24McClatchey A.I. Saotome I. Ramesh V. Gusella J.F. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1253-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As Merlin had been previously reported to be a phosphoprotein (25Takeshima H. Izawa I. Lee P.S. Safdar N. Levin V.A. Saya H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2135-2144PubMed Google Scholar), we were interested in whether the nature of the two migrating species was due to phosphorylation. We first characterized the ability of three polyclonal antisera (directed at three distinct peptide epitopes; see “Experimental Procedures”) to immunoprecipitate Merlin. Because preliminary experiments indicated that these antisera were more efficient in immunoprecipitating Merlin from human as opposed to mouse cells, human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were employed. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Merlin was immunoprecipitated as a doublet around 70 kDa in [35S]methionine metabolically labeled U2OS cell lysates by all three antibodies. We also detected two species in immunoprecipitates from mouse, although the two species of human Merlin migrate more closely together (also observed in immunoblot analysis, not shown). Importantly, no immunoreactivity was observed in Merlin-deficient tumor cells (Fig. 1 B), confirming the specificity of these antibodies. To address directly the nature of the difference between the two Merlin isoforms, lysates from U2OS cells were immunoprecipitated with the sc331 antibody, and aliquots were treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP). As shown in Fig. 1 C, CIP treatment eliminated the slower migrating species (lane 3), whereas CIP buffer alone had no effect (lane 2). More significantly, immunoprecipitation of Merlin from parallel dishes of [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells yielded a single species, which migrated with the same mobility as the slower form in the 35S-labeled immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 C, lane 4). A faster migrating species was never observed in any32P-labeled immunoprecipitates, even upon exposure times 200 times that shown in lane 4 of Fig. 1 C. These data demonstrate that the two Merlin species are differentially phosphorylated, with the slower migrating form representing a phosphorylated species and the faster migrating form most likely a fully unphosphorylated form. Given Merlin's localization to the cell periphery and its status as tumor suppressor, we were interested in whether the regulation of the protein might be affected by cell-cell contact, which can result in growth inhibition of untransformed cells, as first described in NIH3T3 cells (26Fisher H.W. Yeh J. Science. 1967; 155: 581-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were plated at increasing degrees of confluency (Fig. 2 A), and Merlin levels were examined by immunoblotting of total cell lysates normalized for total protein levels. As shown in Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–5, with increasing confluency, the levels of both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Merlin species increased, with the faster migrating, unphosphorylated form of the protein being most prominent when the majority of the cells in the population had established cell-cell contact (Fig. 2 A). To examine the specificity of the response, we then determined whether other cell cycle arrest-inducing agents might up-regulate Merlin levels. We first utilized serum starvation to induce quiescence in subconfluent NIH3T3 cells (same density as in Fig. 2 A, 2nd panel) and, once again, observed the up-regulation of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Merlin species to approximately equimolar amounts (lane 7). Strikingly, restimulation of the serum-starved cells resulted in a rapid disappearance of the unphosphorylated form of the protein as follows: within 5–15 min following serum readdition, only a fraction of the faster migrating form remained (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8 and 9). The level of the phosphorylated, slower migratory species also appeared to decrease modestly following restimulation with 10% serum (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7–9). These results were confirmed using a second polyclonal antibody (1398) (data not shown). Given that both serum starvation and confluency cause an arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, we were interested in whether Merlin levels or phosphorylation status might be affected by growth arrest stimuli generally, or only G1-specific arrests, or if this response was specific to serum deprivation and confluency. To address this question, duplicate sets of sparsely plated NIH3T3 cells were treated with a variety of growth-suppressive agents or were left untreated for 24 h. One set was then subjected to cell cycle characterization utilizing propidium iodide labeling and fluorescent activated cell sorter analysis (Fig. 3 A). Total cell extracts were made from the other set of plates, equilibrated for total protein, and immunoblotted as before (Fig. 3 B). While serum deprivation for 24 h led to a significant increase in protein levels, no up-regulation of phosphorylated or unphosphorylated Merlin was observed in cells treated with another G1 arresting agent, staurosporine (Fig. 3 B, 3rd lane) (27Crissman H.A. Gadbois D.M. Tobey R.A. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7580-7584Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, no up-regulation of Merlin was observed in cells treated with γ-irradiation, nocodazole, or hydroxyurea (Fig. 3 B, 4th and 5th lanes; data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 A, hydroxyurea and nocodazole led to early S phase and G2/M arrest, respectively. Similar results were obtained with U2OS cells (data not shown). Thus, the changes in Merlin expression associated with confluency and serum deprivation appear to be specific and not a secondary consequence of a G1 phase or more general cell cycle arrest. To investigate whether this was a general property of Merlin regulation or a phenomenon specific to NIH3T3 cells, we examined many cell types from different species, including murine embryonic and Rat1 fibroblasts, normal rat kidney (NRK), and human osteosarcoma (MG63 and U20S) cells (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). In all cell types examined, both confluency and serum starvation were associated with the presence of the two migrating forms of Merlin, of which the faster species was diminished upon addition of serum or in low density cells. To examine whether this form of regulation was specific to Merlin, we stripped and reprobed the anti-Merlin immunoblot from Fig. 4 B (of NIH3T3 total cell lysates) with an anti-Radixin polyclonal antibody (12Winckler B. Gonzalez Agosti C. Magendantz M. Solomon F. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2523-2534PubMed Google Scholar). Radixin was also up-regulated by confluency but did not migrate as two distinct species (Fig. 4 B). We determined that there was no cross-reactivity of the Radixin antibody for Merlin. Serum starvation/restimulation did not affect Radixin levels or mobility (data not shown). These same lysates were run in parallel and probed with an anti-c-src antibody, which confirmed that equivalent amounts of protein were loaded in each lane (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether the increase in Merlin levels at higher cell confluency might just be due to exhaustion of critical serum factors in the media, we examined whether treating cells plated at high density with fresh serum might reduce Merlin levels. As shown in Fig. 5, cells plated at near-saturation density showed a preferential loss of the unphosphorylated form of Merlin when treated with serum (compare lanes 3 and 4 of Fig. 5). Importantly, however, the levels of Merlin after serum treatment were still significantly higher than the level in more sparsely plated cells (compare lane 4 to lanes 1 and 2 of Fig. 5). These results suggest that confluency and serum deprivation synergize in their up-regulation of Merlin. Consistent with this idea, serum-starvation of the densely plated cells resulted in even further up-regulation of Merlin levels (compare lanes 3 and 5, Fig. 5). On the contrary, however, cells plated at saturation density (6 × 106for our NIH3T3 cells on a 10-cm dish) did not show a loss of Merlin levels when treated with serum, arguing that at the highest cell densities, these cells were no longer responsive to the serum factors that induce down-regulation of Merlin (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7). To identify which residues are phosphorylated in these cells and to determine if the loss of the unphosphorylated form of Merlin following serum treatment results in the appearance of a novel phosphorylated form, we performed phosphoamino acid analysis on serum-starved and serum-treated U2OS cells. As shown in Fig. 6, Merlin is phosphorylated on both serine and threonine residues but apparently not on tyrosine residues; moreover, the ratio of serine to threonine phosphorylation was not affected by serum treatment. Antisense oligonucleotide experiments have suggested a role for Merlin and the other ERM proteins in regulating cell adhesion (17Takeuchi K. Sato N. Kasahara H. Funayama N. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 19Huynh D.P. Pulst S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 73-84PubMed Google Scholar). Given our results with serum deprivation and confluency, we were interested in whether loss of adhesion might also modulate Merlin protein levels or phosphorylation. To test this idea, total cell lysates were made from serum-starved, confluent NIH3T3 cells before or after trypsinization and placement in suspension in the absence of serum for 30 min (28Clark E.A. Hynes R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14814-14818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 A, placement of the cells in suspension resulted in a rapid loss of the phosphorylated form of Merlin and a concomitant increase in the level of unphosphorylated Merlin. Parallel cultures kept in suspension for 30 min were then replated on tissue culture plastic plates in the absence of serum to address whether adhesion might be capable of re-inducing Merlin phosphorylation. Indeed, upon replating, the slower migrating species of Merlin returned, with the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated reaching nearly one to one at 1 h post-plating (Fig. 7 A). It should be noted for all of these experiments that the plates were washed prior to preparing total cell lysates, so only adherent cells were collected. To examine further a possible connection between Merlin regulation and cell shape, cells in suspension were plated on fibronectin in the absence or presence of CCD, which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton. CCD treatment allows for cell attachment but prevents cell spreading (29Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Plating of cells on fibronectin resulted in clear phosphorylation of Merlin when compared with suspended cells, b"
https://openalex.org/W2332311127,"Members of the Myc proto-oncogene family encode transcription factors that function in multiple aspects of cell behavior, including proliferation, differentiation, transformation and apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that MYC activities are modulated by a network of nuclear bHLH-Zip proteins. The MAX protein is at the center of this network in that it associates with MYC as well as with the family of MAD proteins: MAD1, MXI1, MAD3 and MAD4. Whereas MYC–MAX complexes activate transcription, MAD–MAX complexes repress transcription through identical E-box binding sites. MAD proteins therefore act as antagonists of MYC. Here we report the expression patterns of the Mad gene family in the adult and developing mouse. High level of Mad gene expression in the adult is limited to tissues that display constant renewal of differentiated cell populations. In embryos, Mad transcripts are widely distributed with expression peaking during organogenesis at the onset of differentiation. A detailed analysis of their pattern of expression during chrondrocyte and neuronal differentiation in vivo, and during neuronal differentiation of P19 cells in vitro, shows that Mad family genes are sequentially induced. Mad3 transcripts and proteins are detected in proliferating cells prior to differentiation. Mxi1 and Mad4 transcripts are most abundant in cells that have further advanced along the differentiation pathway, whereas Mad1 is primarily expressed late in differentiation. Taken together, our data suggest that the different members of the MAD protein family exert their functions at distinct steps during the transition between proliferation and differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2079190466,"An early event in signaling by the G-protein-coupled angiotensin II (Ang II) AT1receptor in vascular smooth muscle cells is the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1). In the present study, we show that stimulation of this event by Ang II in vascular smooth muscle cells is accompanied by binding of PLCγ1 to the AT1 receptor in an Ang II- and tyrosine phophorylation-dependent manner. The PLCγ1-AT1 receptor interaction appears to depend on phosphorylation of tyrosine 319 in a YIPP motif in the C-terminal intracellular domain of the AT1 receptor and binding of the phosphorylated receptor by the most C-terminal of two Src homology 2 domains in PLCγ1. PLCγ1 thus binds to the same site in the receptor previously identified for binding by the SHP-2 phosphotyrosine phosphatase·JAK2 tyrosine kinase complex. A single site in the C-terminal tail of the AT1 receptor can, therefore, be bound in a ligand-dependent manner by two different downstream effector proteins. These data demonstrate that G-protein-coupled receptors can physically associate with intracellular proteins other than G proteins, creating membrane-delimited signal transduction complexes similar to those observed for classic growth factor receptors."

In fact, from animal research, it is known that a common property of 14-3-3 proteins is the capability to associate with interacting proteins (5Ferl R.J. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1996; 47: 49-73Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 6Sehnke P.C. Ferl R.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1403-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that a similar mechanism of regulation occurs also for NADH:nitrate reductase from spinach leaves (7Bachmann M. Huber J.L. Liao P.C. Gage D.A. Huber S.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 8Moorhead G. Douglas P. Morrice N. Scarabel M. Aitken A. MacKintosh C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1104-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Nitrate reductase activity is inhibited upon binding of endogenous 14-3-3 proteins, which can occur only after the enzyme has been phosphorylated at a specific serine residue by a calcium-dependent protein kinase (9Bachmann M. McMichel R.W. Huber J.L. Kaiser W.M. Huber S.C. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that these endogenous 14-3-3 proteins are a mixture of different 14-3-3 homologs (7Bachmann M. Huber J.L. Liao P.C. Gage D.A. Huber S.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and that multiple 14-3-3 isoforms are able to inhibit nitrate reductase in vitro(10Bachmann M. Huber J.L. Athwal G.S. Wu K. Ferl R.J. Huber S.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated motif of the nitrate reductase involved in the interaction has been identified, and it is similar to consensus sequences for 14-3-3 binding, occurring in most animal 14-3-3-interacting proteins (10Bachmann M. Huber J.L. Athwal G.S. Wu K. Ferl R.J. Huber S.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that FC is able to disrupt in vitro complexes between nitrate reductase and 14-3-3 proteins, thereby releasing their inhibitory effect. A speculative model for the regulation of plasma membrane H+-ATPase based on that worked out for nitrate reductase has been proposed by Moorhead et al. (8Moorhead G. Douglas P. Morrice N. Scarabel M. Aitken A. MacKintosh C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1104-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). According to it, the stimulatory effect of FC would result from its capability to dissociate 14-3-3 proteins from H+-ATPase. The in vitro evidence supporting this model relies on the activating effects of the phosphoserine 259-Raf1 peptide and protein phosphatase 2A on plasma membrane-bound H+-ATPase activity, which parallels that of FC.However, results from other groups are in contrast with those presented by Moorhead et al. (8Moorhead G. Douglas P. Morrice N. Scarabel M. Aitken A. MacKintosh C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1104-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been demonstrated that FC in vivo treatment of plant tissues, which produces a strong stimulation of H+-ATPase activity, concomitantly brings about a marked increase in plasma membrane-associated 14-3-3 proteins (4Oecking C. Eckerskorn C. Weiler E.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 11Marra M. Fogliano V. Zambardi A. Fullone M.R. Nasta D. Aducci P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Also, the amount of FC bound to plasma membrane appears to be strictly correlated with stimulation of H+-ATPase activity (12De Michelis M.I. Rasi-Caldogno F. Pugliarello M.C. Olivari C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). More recent evidence indicates that administration of FC in vivo or in vitrostabilizes (13Oecking C. Piotrowski M. Hagemann K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Lett. 1997; 2: 236-237Google Scholar) or promotes (14Baunsgaard L. Fuglsang A.T. Korthout H.A.A.J. De Boer A.H. Palmgren M.G. Cell. Mol. Biol. Lett. 1997; 2: 243-244Google Scholar) the interaction between H+-ATPase and 14-3-3 proteins.The data reported here demonstrate that recombinant GF14-6, a 14-3-3 homolog already identified in maize as a component of the G-box-binding complex (15de Vetten N.C. Ferl R.J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1593-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), is able to associate in vitro with H+-ATPase and, remarkably, that this interaction is modulated by FC. By trypsin treatment of H+-ATPase and expression of the isolated C terminus as a GST fusion peptide, we also demonstrate that the 14-3-3 probe interacts with the C-terminal domain of H+-ATPase in a FC-dependent manner. Structural data, obtained by sequencing the hypervariable C-terminal domain of the 33-kDa 14-3-3 protein present in purified preparations of FC receptors from maize, strongly suggest that this isoform is highly homologous to GF14-6, thus prompting its use in the in vitroprotein-protein interaction study.DISCUSSIONRecently, it has been shown by different groups that FC receptors are members of the 14-3-3 eukaryotic protein family (2Marra M. Fullone M.R. Fogliano V. Masi S. Mattei M. Pen J. Aducci P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 3Korthout H.A.A.J. De Boer A.H.

Yet, no information is currently available about the identity of the 14-3-3 isoform(s) competent in FC perception since all of the sequences determined thus far have been obtained from conserved regions of the proteins. In fact, comparison of known sequences indicates that plant 14-3-3 isoforms share a very high degree of homology, with differences being concentrated almost exclusively in the hypervariable 20-amino acid C-terminal peptide, which therefore represents the major determinant of isoform diversity (26Daugherty C.J. Rooney M.F. Miller P.W. Ferl R.J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Hence, to obtain isoform-specific sequence information, we determined the sequence of the 17-amino acid C-terminal peptide of the 33-kDa 14-3-3 protein occurring in purified FC receptor preparations from maize shoots. There was a complete homology to the C terminus of GF14-6, a 14-3-3 homolog already identified in maize as a component of the G-box-binding complex (15de Vetten N.C. Ferl R.J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1593-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This finding, which was suggestive of the occurrence of a significant homology between the two proteins, prompted us to carry out an in vitro investigation of the functional properties of GF14-6. To this purpose, the cDNA of GF14-6 was cloned and expressed as a 32P-phosphorylatable GST fusion protein, which was used as a probe for a partially purified H+-ATPase from maize roots in overlay experiments. The results demonstrated that GF14-6 is able to bind specifically to H+-ATPase and that different treatments or effectors are able to modulate the interaction between the two proteins. In fact, the binding was dependent on the presence of millimolar concentrations of Mg2+, a result reminiscent of that observed for binding of spinach 14-3-3 homologs to nitrate reductase (7Bachmann M. Huber J.L. Liao P.C. Gage D.A. Huber S.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and in accordance with the emerging notion that 14-3-3 proteins bind to phosphorylated serines on target proteins (28Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). More important, the binding was strongly increased by FC. The effect was better seen at 100 μm FC, but was also evident at physiological concentrations of the toxin, such as 5 μm. Interestingly, FC was also effective in the absence of Mg2+, a result that suggests that Mg2+ and FC may act by different mechanisms. Trypsin treatment of H+-ATPase under conditions known to bring about excision of the C-terminal domain abolished the interaction with the 14-3-3 probe and the FC effect as well. This finding strongly suggests that the binding site for 14-3-3 is located in the C-terminal domain, a region that appears to be also essential for FC action. This result was confirmed by using, in the overlay assay, a recombinant GST-fused C-terminal domain of H+-ATPase. In fact, it was found that GF14-6 was also able to associate with the isolated C terminus, but interestingly, in this case, the interaction was completely dependent on the presence of FC. Moreover, it was shown that only the complete C terminus was labeled by GF14-6, whereas the partially proteolyzed C-terminal fragments were unable to interact with the probe. Among them, the highest molecular proteolyzed fragment is only slightly shorter than the full-length C terminus (amino acids 845–947 of the H+-ATPase sequence). In fact, it is recognized by the anti-C terminus antibodies raised against amino acids 927–938 of the H+-ATPase sequence (Fig. 7 B,lane 2). These pieces of evidence suggest that the FC-induced interaction of 14-3-3 with H+-ATPase requires C-terminal integrity and may therefore underlie the involvement of tertiary structure constraints. The very last portion of the C terminus appears to be strictly involved in the FC-stimulated interaction with 14-3-3 proteins since the truncation of a few residues is sufficient to abolish it. This region might hence be crucial for the fulfillment of conformational requirements or, alternatively, directly involved in the binding of FC.In contrast to binding to the whole H+-ATPase, the binding of GF14-6 to the GST-fused C terminus is totally dependent on FC. Since a large body of evidence indicates that 14-3-3 proteins interact physiologically with target proteins by binding to phosphorylated serines within consensus motifs (28Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), a rationale for this discrepancy could be that the recombinant and native C termini differ in their phosphorylation state, with the former being unphosphorylated and the latter being phosphorylated by regulatory endogenous protein kinases. This would also imply that physiological and FC-induced binding of 14-3-3 proteins to H+-ATPase proceeds through different mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, phosphorylation studies of the expressed C terminus with plant endogenous protein kinases are presently in progress.In conclusion, the data reported here provide direct evidence of the capability of 14-3-3 proteins to interact with H+-ATPase and provide a better insight into the mechanism of H+-ATPase activation by FC. In fact, whereas contrasting models have been put forward (8Moorhead G. Douglas P. Morrice N. Scarabel M. Aitken A. MacKintosh C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1104-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 13Oecking C. Piotrowski M. Hagemann K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Lett. 1997; 2: 236-237Google Scholar), our data appear to be fully compatible with that proposed by Oecking et al. (13Oecking C. Piotrowski M. Hagemann K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Lett. 1997; 2: 236-237Google Scholar), according to which FC strengthens the interaction between 14-3-3 and H+-ATPase, thus shifting cytosolic isoforms to the plasma membrane and locking H+-ATPase in its activated state. The identification of the C terminus as the 14-3-3-interacting region appears to be in accordance with the well documented regulatory function of this domain and with recent evidence indicating its direct interaction with 14-3-3 proteins (13Oecking C.

The discovery that receptors of the fungal toxin fusicoccin (FC) 1The abbreviations used are: FC, fusicoccin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: FC, fusicoccin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are members of the 14-3-3 family of eukaryotic regulatory proteins (1Aitken A.

Sci. 1992; 17: 498-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) has shed some light on the FC mechanism of activation of plasma membrane H+-ATPase (2Marra M. Fullone M.R. Fogliano V. Masi S. Mattei M. Pen J. Aducci P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 3Korthout H.A.A.J. De Boer A.H.

In fact, from animal research, it is known that a common property of 14-3-3 proteins is the capability to associate with interacting proteins (5Ferl R.J. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1996; 47: 49-73Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 6Sehnke P.C. Ferl R.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1403-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that a similar mechanism of regulation occurs also for NADH:nitrate reductase from spinach leaves (7Bachmann M. Huber J.L. Liao P.C. Gage D.A. Huber S.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 8Moorhead G. Douglas P. Morrice N. Scarabel M. Aitken A. MacKintosh C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1104-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Nitrate reductase activity is inhibited upon binding of endogenous 14-3-3 proteins, which can occur only after the enzyme has been phosphorylated at a specific serine residue by a calcium-dependent protein kinase (9Bachmann M. McMichel R.W. Huber J.L. Kaiser W.M. Huber S.C. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that these endogenous 14-3-3 proteins are a mixture of different 14-3-3 homologs (7Bachmann M. Huber J.L. Liao P.C. Gage D.A. Huber S.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and that multiple 14-3-3 isoforms are able to inhibit nitrate reductase in vitro(10Bachmann M. Huber J.L. Athwal G.S. Wu K. Ferl R.J. Huber S.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated motif of the nitrate reductase involved in the interaction has been identified, and it is similar to consensus sequences for 14-3-3 binding, occurring in most animal 14-3-3-interacting proteins (10Bachmann M. Huber J.L. Athwal G.S. Wu K. Ferl R.J. Huber S.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that FC is able to disrupt in vitro complexes between nitrate reductase and 14-3-3 proteins, thereby releasing their inhibitory effect. A speculative model for the regulation of plasma membrane H+-ATPase based on that worked out for nitrate reductase has been proposed by Moorhead et al. (8Moorhead G. Douglas P. Morrice N. Scarabel M. Aitken A. MacKintosh C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1104-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). According to it, the stimulatory effect of FC would result from its capability to dissociate 14-3-3 proteins from H+-ATPase. The in vitro evidence supporting this model relies on the activating effects of the phosphoserine 259-Raf1 peptide and protein phosphatase 2A on plasma membrane-bound H+-ATPase activity, which parallels that of FC. However, results from other groups are in contrast with those presented by Moorhead et al. (8Moorhead G. Douglas P. Morrice N. Scarabel M. Aitken A. MacKintosh C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1104-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been demonstrated that FC in vivo treatment of plant tissues, which produces a strong stimulation of H+-ATPase activity, concomitantly brings about a marked increase in plasma membrane-associated 14-3-3 proteins (4Oecking C. Eckerskorn C. Weiler E.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 11Marra M. Fogliano V. Zambardi A. Fullone M.R. Nasta D. Aducci P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Also, the amount of FC bound to plasma membrane appears to be strictly correlated with stimulation of H+-ATPase activity (12De Michelis M.I. Rasi-Caldogno F. Pugliarello M.C. Olivari C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). More recent evidence indicates that administration of FC in vivo or in vitrostabilizes (13Oecking C. Piotrowski M. Hagemann K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Lett. 1997; 2: 236-237Google Scholar) or promotes (14Baunsgaard L. Fuglsang A.T. Korthout H.A.A.J. De Boer A.H. Palmgren M.G. Cell. Mol. Biol. Lett. 1997; 2: 243-244Google Scholar) the interaction between H+-ATPase and 14-3-3 proteins. The data reported here demonstrate that recombinant GF14-6, a 14-3-3 homolog already identified in maize as a component of the G-box-binding complex (15de Vetten N.C. Ferl R.J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1593-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), is able to associate in vitro with H+-ATPase and, remarkably, that this interaction is modulated by FC. By trypsin treatment of H+-ATPase and expression of the isolated C terminus as a GST fusion peptide, we also demonstrate that the 14-3-3 probe interacts with the C-terminal domain of H+-ATPase in a FC-dependent manner. Structural data, obtained by sequencing the hypervariable C-terminal domain of the 33-kDa 14-3-3 protein present in purified preparations of FC receptors from maize, strongly suggest that this isoform is highly homologous to GF14-6, thus prompting its use in the in vitroprotein-protein interaction study. DISCUSSIONRecently, it has been shown by different groups that FC receptors are members of the 14-3-3 eukaryotic protein family (2Marra M. Fullone M.R. Fogliano V. Masi S. Mattei M. Pen J. Aducci P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 3Korthout H.A.A.J. De Boer A.H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1681-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Oecking C. Eckerskorn C. Weiler E.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Yet, no information is currently available about the identity of the 14-3-3 isoform(s) competent in FC perception since all of the sequences determined thus far have been obtained from conserved regions of the proteins. In fact, comparison of known sequences indicates that plant 14-3-3 isoforms share a very high degree of homology, with differences being concentrated almost exclusively in the hypervariable 20-amino acid C-terminal peptide, which therefore represents the major determinant of isoform diversity (26Daugherty C.J. Rooney M.F. Miller P.W. Ferl R.J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Hence, to obtain isoform-specific sequence information, we determined the sequence of the 17-amino acid C-terminal peptide of the 33-kDa 14-3-3 protein occurring in purified FC receptor preparations from maize shoots. There was a complete homology to the C terminus of GF14-6, a 14-3-3 homolog already identified in maize as a component of the G-box-binding complex (15de Vetten N.C. Ferl R.J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1593-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This finding, which was suggestive of the occurrence of a significant homology between the two proteins, prompted us to carry out an in vitro investigation of the functional properties of GF14-6. To this purpose, the cDNA of GF14-6 was cloned and expressed as a 32P-phosphorylatable GST fusion protein, which was used as a probe for a partially purified H+-ATPase from maize roots in overlay experiments. The results demonstrated that GF14-6 is able to bind specifically to H+-ATPase and that different treatments or effectors are able to modulate the interaction between the two proteins. In fact, the binding was dependent on the presence of millimolar concentrations of Mg2+, a result reminiscent of that observed for binding of spinach 14-3-3 homologs to nitrate reductase (7Bachmann M. Huber J.L. Liao P.C. Gage D.A. Huber S.C.

This association was direct and mediated by the Grb7 Src homology (SH)2 domain. Co-expression of erbB2 with erbB3 point mutants was used to map Grb7 binding sites. This demonstrated that tyrosine 1180 and 1243 represent the major and minor sites of Grb7 interaction, respectively. Although these recognition sequences possess an Asn residue at +2 relative to the phosphotyrosine and therefore represent potential Grb2 binding sites, phosphopeptide competition and “pull-down” experiments demonstrated that they interact preferentially with the Grb7 versus the Grb2 SH2 domain. Substitution analysis indicated that an Arg residue at +3 could act as a selectivity determinant, but the effect was context-dependent. Consequently, the Grb2 and Grb7 SH2 domains possess overlapping, but distinct, specificities. These studies therefore identify Grb7 as an in vivo target of erbB3 and erbB4 and provide an underlying mechanism for the ability of erbB3 to recruit Grb7 and not Grb2, a property unique among erbB receptors.

For example, the EGFR possesses multiple ligands, including EGF, transforming growth factor-α, amphiregulin, and betacellulin, but betacellulin also binds erbB4 (8Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6071-6076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and both erbB3 and erbB4 provide receptors for the heregulin/neuregulin 1 and neuregulin 2 families of ligands (9Holmes W.E.

Furthermore, ligand-induced erbB receptor heterodimerization, first detected between the EGFR and erbB2 (17King C.R. Borrello I. Bellot F. Comoglio P. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Wada T. Qian X. Greene M.I.

In particular, erbB2-containing heterodimers are preferred, and this receptor favors interaction with erbB3. Moreover, heterodimerization is critical for the activity of the erbB3 receptor because it is kinase-impaired and hence reliant on transphosphorylation by other receptors for signal generation (2Soltoff S.P.

A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Dimerization of erbB receptors leads to kinase activation and phosphorylation of their cytoplasmic domains on specific tyrosine residues, thus creating binding sites for signaling molecules containing phosphotyrosine binding or Src homology (SH) 2 domains (24Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). The latter are conserved noncatalytic regions of approximately 100 amino acids which, along with other modules such as SH3 and pleckstrin homology domains, mediate inter- and intramolecular interactions involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction. The specificity of the SH2 domain binding is determined by both the residues flanking the phosphotyrosine, in particular the three COOH-terminal amino acids, and the residues in the SH2 domain which interact with these sites (24Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar,25Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G.

For example, the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) p85 subunit preferentially binds a pYM/VXM motif, and the Grb2 SH2 domain recognizes a pYXN motif (25Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Consequently, the signaling specificity of a given receptor tyrosine kinase is determined largely by its repertoire of SH2 domain docking sites and the nature of the proteins that these recruit. Proteins that contain SH2 domains can be divided into two distinct groups: those that exhibit enzymatic activity and those that contain only noncatalytic protein modules (24Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar, 27Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Those in the latter class, which includes Crk, Nck, and Grb2, act as adaptors linking separate catalytic subunits to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors or other signaling intermediates. For example, Grb2 recruits the Ras GDP-GTP exchange factor Sos (28Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). A rapidly emerging adaptor subfamily has been described recently which comprises Grb7, Grb10, and Grb14 (29Margolis B. Silvennoinen O. Comoglio F. Roonprapunt C. Skolnik E. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

These proteins exhibit significant sequence homology and a common overall architecture, which includes a conserved NH2-terminal proline-rich motif, a central pleckstrin homology domain, and a COOH-terminal SH2 domain. Grb7 is bound by a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases upon ligand stimulation, including erbB2 (32Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A.W. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. Eustachio P.D. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M.

Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Osborne C.K. Margolis B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and the protein tyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP2 (36Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this reflects an overlap in Grb2 and Grb7 SH2 domain specificity (33Janes P.W. Lackmann M. Church W.B. Sanderson G.M. Sutherland R.L. Daly R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8490-8497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, Grb10 is recruited directly by the insulin receptor (37O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22506-22513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 38Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, despite the intriguing structure of these adaptors and their participation in diverse signaling systems, their detailed mechanisms and functions have yet to be identified. Both the ERBB and GRB7 gene families exhibit differential expression in certain human cancers. Amplification and/or overexpression of ERBB2 occurs in approximately 20% of human breast cancers and correlates with a poor prognosis (39Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J. Stuart S.G. Udove J. Ullrich A. Press M.F. Science. 1989; 244: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (6289) Google Scholar); high expression of ERBB3 and ERBB4 has also been detected in human breast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancers (21Kraus M.H.

J. Physiol. 1996; 148: 549-558Google Scholar). GRB7 maps close to ERBB2 on chromosome 17q, resulting in frequent co-amplification of these two genes, and the concomitant overexpression of the two interacting gene products is likely to up-regulate a fundamental receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway in human breast cancer (32Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A.W. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. Eustachio P.D. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Osborne C.K. Margolis B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, although the erbB3 and erbB4 receptors represent heterodimerization partners for erbB2 and are commonly expressed at high levels in human breast cancer cells, their interaction with Grb7 has yet to be characterized. We therefore addressed this issue by analyzing Grb7 recruitment by heregulin-activated erbB receptors. This demonstrated that Grb7 represents an in vivo target of the erbB3 and erbB4 receptor tyrosine kinases and identified a signaling function for two previously uncharacterized erbB3 phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, because these sites bound Grb7 and not Grb2, this provides an important insight into the signaling specificity of erbB3 and the SH2 domain selectivity of these adaptor proteins. The sources and maintenance of the human breast cancer, HEK-293, and HER1–2 cell lines were as described previously (31Daly R.J. Sanderson G.M. Janes P.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12502-12510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 43Buckley M.F. Sweeney K.J. Hamilton J.A. Sini R.L. Manning D.L. Nicholson R.I. deFazio A. Watts C.K. Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2127-2133PubMed Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-erbB2 (Novocastra, Newcastle, U. K.); polyclonal anti-erbB3 MK4, which was used for immunoprecipitation; monoclonal anti-erbB3 2F12 (44Kim H.H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24747-24755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for Western blotting; polyclonal anti-erbB3 C-17 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting; polyclonal anti-erbB4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), for Western blotting; recombinant anti-phosphotyrosine (RC20)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); polyclonal anti-Grb7 (Transduction Laboratories); polyclonal anti-Shc (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); and monoclonal anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The monoclonal anti-erbB4 antibody used for immunoprecipitations was produced for our laboratory from a mouse immunized with recombinant erbB4 extracellular domain. For immunoprecipitation experiments, breast cancer cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in either 10-cm tissue culture dishes or T150 flasks. After overnight starvation in serum-free medium, recombinant heregulin β2 (amino acids 177–237) (45Fiddes R.J. Janes P.J. Sanderson G.M. Sivertsen S.P. Sutherland R.L. Daly R.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1567-1577PubMed Google Scholar) was added to a final concentration of 5 nm. After a 10-min exposure to heregulin, the cells were lysed as described previously (46Janes P.W. Daly R.J. deFazio A. Sutherland R.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3601-3608PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration was estimated using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Antibodies (1–2 μg) were incubated with lysates for at least 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were then collected by incubation with 20 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) for at least 1 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were then collected by centrifugation, washed three times in cold lysis buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the samples were Western blotted with the appropriate antibody. Visualization of bound antibody was by enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). Densitometric analysis of autoradiographs was performed using the IP Lab Gel analysis program (Signal Analytics Corp., Vienna, VA). GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 domains of Grb2 and Grb7 were as described previously (33Janes P.W. Lackmann M. Church W.B. Sanderson G.M. Sutherland R.L. Daly R.J. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 μg of fusion protein coupled to glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with 400 μl of lysate from control or heregulin-treated ZR-75-1 cells for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then collected by centrifugation and washed three times in cell lysis buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot using erbB receptor-specific antibodies. Direct binding of the Grb7 SH2 domain was demonstrated by a “Far Western” approach. erbB receptors were immunoprecipitated from control or heregulin-treated breast cancer cells, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The filters were then incubated with fusion proteins diluted to 1 μg/ml in TBS (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 4 mm dithiothreitol. After washing, bound fusion protein was detected using an anti-GST monoclonal antibody. Subconfluent SK-BR-3 cells were starved overnight in serum-free RPMI medium and then incubated in phosphate-free minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 h. The medium was then replaced with phosphate-free minimal essential medium containing 0.4 mCi/ml 32Pi (Amersham Australia Proprietary Ltd., Sydney, NSW, Australia) and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. After 3 h the medium was removed and the cells incubated with heregulin (5 nm in phosphate-free minimal essential medium) for 10 min. Control cells received growth factor diluent (0.1% bovine serum albumin in TBS) only. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before preparation of cell lysates. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating the32Pi-labeled cell lysates (1.5 mg of protein) with 5 μg of anti-Grb7 antibody for 16 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was then added for a further 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were then collected by centrifugation, washed 8 times in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Two-thirds of each sample was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and exposed for autoradiography while the remaining third was subjected to Western blot analysis. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed essentially as described (49van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1993: 31-59Google Scholar). The Grb7 band was excised, washed twice in water, and then hydrolyzed for 2 h at 110 °C in 6 m HCl. The samples were dried by vacuum desiccation and then dissolved in 6 μl of pH 1.9 buffer containing 2 μg of phosphoamino acid standards (Sigma). Thin layer electrophoresis was then performed using 0.1-mm plastic-backed cellulose TLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in a Multiphor II apparatus (Amrad Pharmacia Biotech, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). The run conditions for the first dimension (pH 1.9) were 1,500 V for 50 min (flatbed plate temperature 16 °C) and for the second dimension (pH 3.5 buffer) 1,000 V for 30 min. After visualization of the standards by ninhydrin staining the plate was exposed for autoradiography. To construct a mammalian expression vector for hGrb7, the EcoRI insert containing full-length hGRB7 cDNA (50Kishi T. Sasaki H. Akiyama N. Ishizuka T. Sakamoto H. Aizawa S. Sugimura T. Terada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was excised from a pUC18 clone. This fragment was then blunt ended with Klenow enzyme and cloned into HindIII-digested, blunt-ended pRcCMV (InVitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands). To generate erbB2 and erbB3 expression vectors, a full-length ERBB2 cDNA clone was subcloned into HindIII-digested pRcCMV, and a cDNA clone encoding full-length erbB3 was subcloned intoXbaI/XhoI-digested pCMVneo. Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations in erbB3 were performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to produce erbB3-Y1180F, erbB3-Y1243F, and erbB3-Y1180,1243F. Correct incorporation of these mutations was verified by DNA sequencing (fmol DNA Cycle Sequencing System, Promega). HEK-293 cells stably transfected with hGRB7/pRcCMV (HEK/Grb7 cells) were used for transient transfection studies. To generate HEK/Grb7 cells, HEK-293 cells were transfected with hGRB7/pRcCMV as described previously (33Janes P.W. Lackmann M. Church W.B. Sanderson G.M. Sutherland R.L. Daly R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8490-8497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After selection with Geneticin (500 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.), single clones were analyzed for Grb7 expression by Western blot. One clone expressing a high level of Grb7 was expanded and used for transient transfections. HEK/Grb7 cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 10-cm tissue culture dishes. The erbB2 expression construct (10 μg) was co-transfected with either the wild-type or a mutant erbB3 expression construct (10 μg) as described previously (33Janes P.W. Lackmann M. Church W.B. Sanderson G.M. Sutherland R.L. Daly R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8490-8497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Control cultures received the empty vectors alone. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium and the cells cultured for a further 24 h. The cultures were then stimulated for 10 min with heregulin (5 nm final concentration) or vehicle alone before preparation of cell lysates in 500 μl of lysis buffer. Synthetic phosphopeptides were synthesized by Chiron Technologies Proprietary Ltd. (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) and were as follows; Tyr-1139, PQPEpYVNQPD; Q1142R, PQPEpYVNRPD; Tyr-1196, VENPEpYLTPQG; Tyr-1180, DEEYEpYMNRRR; R1183Q, DEEYEpYMNQRR; Tyr-1243, DEDYEpYMNRQR, where pY represents a phosphotyrosine residue. These were purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography to ≥ 95% and their identity confirmed by ion spray mass spectrometry. Phosphopeptide competition experiments were performed using lysates from HER1–2 cells, essentially as described previously (33Janes P.W. Lackmann M. Church W.B. Sanderson G.M. Sutherland R.L. Daly R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8490-8497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Peptides were coupled to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) under anhydrous conditions. In brief, 50 μg of peptide (in dimethyl sulfoxide) was incubated with 100 μl of Affi-Gel 15 (in isopropyl alcohol) for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1m ethanolamine, pH 8, and the beads were washed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl. This prepared sufficient coupled peptide for 20 binding reactions, which were performed as follows. The matrix was incubated with 250 μl of lysis buffer containing 1 μg of GST, GST-Grb2 SH2, or GST-Grb7 SH2 fusion protein for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed three times in 1 ml of lysis buffer. The presence of fusion protein bound to the coupled peptide was analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against GST. Although others have demonstrated a strong association of Grb7 with erbB2 in SK-BR-3 cells (32Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A.W. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. Eustachio P.D. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M.

For example, SK-BR-3 cells overexpress erbB3 relative to normal breast epithelial cells, whereas BT-474 cells express high levels of erbB3 and erbB4 (41Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.-M. Whitney G.S.

Because heregulin administration leads to activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of these receptors, serum-starved SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells were stimulated with this growth factor and Grb7 immunoprecipitates analyzed for the presence of associated proteins by Western blot. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots revealed heregulin-inducible association of Grb7 with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 52 kDa and 180–185 kDa (p180–185, Fig. 1 A). The use of specific antibodies identified the former as the p52 isoform of Shc (Fig. 1 A). Association of Grb7 with tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc proteins has been observed by other workers (32Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A.W. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. Eustachio P.D. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Osborne C.K. Margolis B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 34Yokote K.

The identity of the proteins comprising the p180–185 band was determined by blotting the immunoprecipitates with erbB-specific antibodies (Fig. 1 B). Increased levels of erbB2 and erbB3 were found in the complexes isolated from heregulin-treated SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells. Furthermore, analysis of anti-erbB4 immunoprecipitates from BT-474 cells detected recruitment of Grb7 by this receptor which was increased upon heregulin administration. The association between erbB2 and Grb7 observed in the absence of ligand administration is the result of significant basal receptor tyrosine phosphorylation often observed in breast cancer cell lines (46Janes P.W. Daly R.J. deFazio A. Sutherland R.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3601-3608PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies on erbB receptor heterodimerization (20Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G.

Genetic and biochemical studies suggest that KSR is a positive regulator of Ras signaling that functions between Ras and Raf or in a pathway parallel to Raf. We examined the effect of mammalian KSR expression on the activation of extracellular ligand-regulated (ERK) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in fibroblasts. Ectopic expression of KSR inhibited the activation of ERK MAP kinase by insulin, phorbol ester, or activated alleles of Ras, Raf, and mitogen and extracellular-regulated kinase. Expression of deletion mutants of KSR demonstrated that the KSR kinase domain was necessary and sufficient for the inhibitory effect of KSR on ERK MAP kinase activity. KSR inhibited cell transformation by activated RasVal-12 but had no effect on the ability of RasVal-12 to induce membrane ruffling. These data indicate that KSR is a potent modulator of a signaling pathway essential to normal and oncogenic cell growth and development.

Biol. 1994; 59: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In turn, Ras proteins regulate multiple downstream signal transduction pathways through direct protein-protein interactions (2White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M.

Genetic screens for additional downstream effectors of Ras in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans lead to the identification of the loss-of-function allele kinase suppressor of Ras (7Therrien M.

Epistasis experiments indicated that KSR was a positive regulator of Ras signaling acting in series between Ras and Raf or in parallel to Raf. Results from these genetic studies were further supported by biochemical studies examining the function of KSR (10Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Murine KSR cooperated with activated RasVal-12 (10Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) or with 14-3-3 proteins (11Xing H.M. Kornfeld K. Muslin A.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) to enhance the maturation of Xenopus oocytes. KSR expression enhanced the biological activity of RasVal-12 by accelerating the kinetics of Raf (11Xing H.M. Kornfeld K. Muslin A.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), MEK1, and ERK MAP kinase activation (10Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and this effect could be inhibited by introduction of dominant-negative Raf (11Xing H.M. Kornfeld K. Muslin A.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the cooperative activity of KSR was localized, not to its putative kinase domain, but to a non-catalytic amino-terminal region including a conserved, cysteine-rich area termed CA3 (12Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Cacace A. Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12792-12796Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here we have examined the ability of KSR to affect the activation of ERK MAP kinase by growth factors, activated Ras, and activated effectors of Ras. We observed that the ectopic expression of KSR resulted in the inhibition of ERK MAP kinase activation. Furthermore, this inhibitory effect of KSR on ERK MAP kinase activity resulted in the suppression of cell transformation by activated Ras and could be mimicked by expression of the KSR kinase domain alone. These data suggest that distinct structural domains within KSR may differentially modulate signal transduction between Raf, MEK, and ERK MAP kinase. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C. 293T cells were grown in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. REF-52 cells were grown in 6% CO2. The FLAG epitope tag was added to the COOH terminus of KSR using a PCR strategy with pMA57 cDNA (KSR in pBS) as the template. The primers were 5′-CTCTGGACATCAATAAGACTAG-3′ and 5′-CGGGGTACCTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCATCTTTGGATTACCGGACTCCAG-3′. The PCR product was digested with NsiI, KpnI, and PvuII to yield a 383-base pair fragment containing the COOH terminus of KSR and the FLAG epitope. This fragment was ligated back into pMA57 after NsiI and KpnI digestion to give pBSKSRFLAG. The pBSKSRFLAG cDNA was cut with EcoRI and KpnI to remove KSRFLAG from pBS. This 2724-base pair fragment was ligated into the same sites of pCMV5 (13Andersson S. Davis D.N. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to produce pCMV5KSR. For the construction of KSR C540, a primer containing anEcoRI site, a start codon, and an ApaI site (5′-GGGAATTCGCCACCATGGGCCCATCTCT-3′), and its complement were made. The two primers were annealed together, cut with EcoRI and ApaI and then ligated into pCMV5KSR cut withEcoRI and ApaI. EcoRI and ApaI digestion of pCMV5KSR removed the portion of the cDNA encoding the NH2 terminus of KSR. pMA57 cDNA was used as a template to create KSR N539 using a PCR strategy. The upstream primer was 5′-GCAGGAATTCCCTCGGGGCTTTCCTGCCG-3′ and the downstream primer, which added the FLAG epitope and an XbaI restriction site to the 3′ end, was 5′-GCTCTAGATCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCCTCCAGGGCCGGCGGGAGC-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XbaI to yield a 1722-base pair fragment. pCMV5 was also digested with EcoRI and XbaI and the PCR products ligated into these sites to produce pCMV5KSR N539. All recombinant DNA was sequenced to confirm the fidelity of each construct. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated cDNAs using calcium phosphate (14Van Aelst L. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This procedure resulted in transfection efficiencies in 293T cells near 90%. Cells were deprived of serum 48 h after transfection, then stimulated with 100 nm insulin or 1 μm PMA for 10 min and lysed. Clarified cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using ERK-1 and ERK-2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and ERK MAP kinase assays were performed using myelin basic protein as a substrate (15Rao G.N. Baas A.S. Glasgow W.C. Eling T.E. Runge M.S. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32586-32591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by the addition of sample buffer and heating to 110 °C for 3 min and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12% gel. Radiolabeled myelin basic protein was quantified using phosphor storage technology (Molecular Dynamics). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and Western blots were developed using anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Kodak IBI, 1:3000), anti-c-Myc (9E10, American Type Culture Collection, 1:500), anti-c-Raf (Transduction Laboratories, 1:1000), or anti-MEK1 (Transduction Laboratories, 1:1000) antibodies. Blots were developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium using goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. For the microinjection assay, REF-52 cells were plated onto acid-washed glass coverslips and grown to confluence, then placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h before microinjection. A plasmid mixture containing the indicated plasmids in microinjection buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm NaH2PO4) was microinjected into cell nuclei. For monitoring ERK MAP kinase activation, cells were fixed at the indicated times in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min at room temperature. The coverslips were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with rabbit antibody to tyrosine-phosphorylated p42/44 ERK MAP kinase (New England Biolabs) in phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml) and then with rhodamine-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulin G. For membrane ruffling, cells were fixed and permeabilized as above then incubated with rat antibodies to Ras (Y13-259) followed by fluorescein-conjugated goat antibodies to rat immunoglobulin G. To detect KSR expression, cells were stained with mouse M2 antibodies to the FLAG epitope followed with fluorescein-conjugated goat antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin G. The cells were photographed with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (14Van Aelst L. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with either empty vector or pCGT RasVal-12 (500 ng) plus the indicated concentration of KSR for a total of 15.5 μg of total plasmid DNA/10-cm dish. Transfected cells were grown in media containing calf serum (5%) for 14 days, then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with Giemsa. Foci of transformed cells appear as diffuse, darkly staining spots. Epistasis experiments in Drosophila and C. elegans have suggested that KSR is a positive effector of Ras-mediated signals (7Therrien M. Chang H.C. Solomon N.M. Karim F.D. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 8Sundaram M. Han M. Cell. 1995; 83: 889-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 9Kornfeld K. Hom D.B. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The ability of KSR to affect ERK MAP kinase activity was assessed by transient expression of KSR in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. It is well established that insulin stimulates ERK MAP kinase (16Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Science. 1985; 233: 1061-1068Crossref Scopus (539) Google Scholar) through activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK signaling pathway (17Medema R.H. De Vries-Smits A.M.M. Van der Zon G.C.M. Maassen J.A. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18Porras A. Muszynski K. Rapp U.R. Santos E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12741-12748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with these data, insulin induced an 8-fold activation of ERK MAP kinase in cells transfected with the human insulin receptor (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, co-expressing KSR with the human insulin receptor resulted in the 6-fold inhibition of ERK MAP kinase activity. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of KSR on ERK MAP kinase activation is unique to the insulin signaling system, we tested the effect of KSR expression on ERK MAP kinase activation by the phorbol ester PMA. Phorbol esters bind to protein kinase C, which can phosphorylate and activate Raf independent of Ras to stimulate ERK MAP kinase (19Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marmé D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). PMA treatment of 293T cells activated ERK MAP kinase activity 30-fold. However, expression of KSR also resulted in a 7-fold inhibition of PMA-stimulated ERK MAP kinase activity (Fig. 1 B). These observations indicated that the mechanism of ERK MAP kinase inhibition by KSR was not due to its direct effect on growth factor receptors. Intracellular signals are transmitted sequentially from Ras to Raf, and then to MEK, which phosphorylates and activates ERK MAP kinase (5Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). To determine the level in the signal transduction cascade at which KSR inhibits MAP kinase activation, 293T cells were transfected with RasAsp-12 (20Chipperfield R.G. Jones S.S. Lo K.M. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1809-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), Raf-CAAX (21Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), or MEKEE (22Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). Expression of RasAsp-12, Raf-CAAX, and MEKEE alone led to the activation of ERK MAP kinase, and this activation was abolished by co-transfection of KSR (Fig. 2 A). This observation suggests that KSR inhibits the activation of ERK MAP kinase downstream of, or at the level of, MEK. The action of KSR was further examined by co-injection of KSR with activated RasVal-12, Raf-CAAX, and MEKEE into quiescent REF-52 cells. To monitor MAP kinase activity in the injected cells, ERK2 expression plasmid was included in the injection mixture. Activation of the ectopically expressed ERK2 was assayed with polyclonal antibodies raised to the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of ERK MAP kinase. It should be noted that the level of endogenous ERK MAP kinase in REF-52 cells is too low to be detected by this antibody. ERK MAP kinase was activated in REF-52 cells within 3 h after injection of RasVal-12, Raf-CAAX, or MEKEE expression vectors as indicated by the enhanced immunostaining of tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK MAP kinase (Fig. 2 B). It has been documented that activated ERK kinase translocates to the nucleus (23Gonzalez F.A. Seth A. Raden D.L. Bowman D.S. Fay F.S. Davis R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1089-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect the accumulation of activated ERK MAP kinase only in the nuclei of injected cells. Rather, the protein appears to be localized both to the cytosol and nucleus, presumably due to overexpression. Ten hours after injection of RasVal-12, Raf-CAAX, or MEKEE expression vectors alone, ERK MAP kinase remained activated. In contrast, ERK MAP kinase activation was suppressed 10 h after co-injection of KSR with RasVal-12, Raf-CAAX, or MEKEE DNA (Fig. 2 B). Immunostaining revealed that KSR was expressed primarily in the cytosol of microinjected REF-52 cells (Fig. 2 C). We have consistently observed that KSR expression had no inhibitory effects on RasVal-12, Raf-CAAX, or MEKEE-induced ERK MAP kinase activation when monitored 3 h after injection. These observations suggest that the effects of KSR on ERK MAP kinase activation might be temporally regulated. Identical results were obtained when KSR was expressed without the FLAG epitope tag, eliminating the possibility that the effect is due to the epitope tag (data not shown). The ability of KSR to affect other Ras-mediated signaling pathways was also tested. Injection of fibroblast cells with activated Ras is known to induce membrane ruffling (16Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Science. 1985; 233: 1061-1068Crossref Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Ras-mediated membrane ruffling and activation of ERK MAP kinase are mediated by distinct effectors (24Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Co-injection of KSR had no effect on the ability of RasVal-12 to induce membrane ruffling (Fig. 3). This observation suggests that KSR functions specifically to regulate pathways affecting ERK MAP kinase and support data (Fig. 2) indicating that KSR does not exert its effect by interfering directly with Ras function. KSR consists of amino-terminal regions conserved between alleles from different species and a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain with greatest homology to the Raf kinase (7Therrien M. Chang H.C. Solomon N.M. Karim F.D. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 8Sundaram M. Han M. Cell. 1995; 83: 889-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 9Kornfeld K. Hom D.B. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Truncated forms of KSR, consisting of amino acids 1–539 (KSR N539) or the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain (amino acids 540–873, KSR C540) were tagged with the FLAG epitope and expressed in 293T cells or microinjected into REF-52 cells to determine each region's contribution to the ability of KSR to suppress ERK MAP kinase activation. KSR N539 had no effect on the activation of ERK MAP kinase in 293T cells by phorbol esters (Fig. 4 A), or in REF-52 cells by co-injection with RasVal-12 (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, KSR C540 was a potent suppressor of ERK MAP kinase activation in both 293T and REF-52 cells (Fig. 4). These data demonstrate that expression of the KSR kinase domain alone is necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of ERK MAP kinase activation. ERK MAP kinase activation contributes to the transforming potential of activated Ras. Mutated, constitutively activated members of this kinase cascade can induce transformation in certain cell types, whereas expression of kinase-deficient forms of these components interfere with the mitogenic effects of Ras (6Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 67-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To test the role of KSR in transformation, we co-transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with expression plasmids for RasVal-12 and increasing concentrations of KSR. To visualize the foci, cells were fixed and stained with Giemsa 14 days after transfection. We found that focus formation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts by RasVal-12 was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by co-transfection of KSR (Fig. 5), which is consistent with its ability to suppress ERK MAP kinase activity. In this report we have examined the ability of ectopic KSR to affect ERK MAP kinase activation by extracellular stimuli and upstream regulators. We find that murine KSR inhibits the activation of ERK MAP kinase by these factors. The ability of KSR to inhibit activation of ERK MAP kinase by activated Ras, Raf-CAAX, and MEKEE (Fig. 2) indicates that KSR exerts its inhibitory effect downstream or at the level of MEK. Consistent with its inhibitory effect on ERK MAP kinase activity, KSR inhibits the transforming potential of activated RasVal-12 when co-transfected into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 5). The inhibitory effects of KSR in this report contrast with observations that KSR facilitates Xenopus oocyte maturation and Balb/c 3T3 fibroblast transformation by RasVal-12 (10Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The enhancing function of KSR has been attributed to the ability of the non-catalytic CA3 region in the amino-terminal portion of KSR to activate Raf (12Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Cacace A. Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12792-12796Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect a positive effect of the KSR amino-terminal domain on ERK MAP kinase activity when it was transiently expressed in 293T or REF-52 cells (Fig. 4). The delay between the time of KSR expression and the assay of ERK MAP kinase activity may conceal a positive effect of the KSR amino-terminal domain. Consistent with this possibility, co-injection of KSR did not inhibit the initial phase of ERK MAP kinase activation by RasVal-12, Raf-CAAX, or MEKEE (Fig. 2 B). The delayed inhibitory effect of KSR raises the possibility that one role of KSR may be the feedback inhibition of activated ERK MAP kinase. The inhibitory affect of KSR on ERK MAP kinase activation is consistent with the function of KSR in a pathway parallel to Raf (7Therrien M. Chang H.C. Solomon N.M. Karim F.D. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) to deactivate ERK MAP kinase. Overexpression of KSR or the KSR kinase domain might constitutively activate the inhibitory program and down-regulate ERK MAP kinase signaling. The inhibitory effect of intact KSR on ERK MAP kinase activation was mimicked by transfection or microinjection of a truncated construct encoding the KSR kinase domain (Fig. 4). Our observations are consistent with the inhibition of RasVal-12-induced MEK and ERK activation in Xenopus oocytes and RasVal-12-induced Balb/c 3T3 transformation upon expression of the isolated KSR kinase domain in these cells (10Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, in that study full-length KSR did not have the same effect. Observations that an amino-terminal region of KSR facilitates Raf-activated pathways (10Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 12Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Cacace A. Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12792-12796Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and that the carboxyl-terminal region of KSR inhibits ERK MAP kinase activation (Fig. 4) raise the possibility of cross-talk between these two domains of KSR. If the amino-terminal domain of KSR interacts with novel proteins to activate Raf (12Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Cacace A. Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12792-12796Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), it is possible that the KSR kinase domain inhibits the stimulatory function of the amino-terminal domain by regulating the binding of those putative proteins. Regulation could occur through phosphorylation of the KSR amino-terminal region. The KSR kinase domain might also competitively inhibit the association of novel proteins with the KSR amino-terminal domain. Such an interaction could be independent of KSR kinase activity. The inhibitory affect of KSR on ERK MAP kinase activation is also consistent with the predicted action of an ectopically expressed molecular scaffold. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ste5p is a scaffold protein that binds yeast homologs of the mammalian ERK MAP kinase cascade (25Marcus S. Polverino A. Barr M. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7762-7766Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although KSR bears no obvious structural homology to Ste5p, two-hybrid and biochemical analyses indicate that the KSR kinase domain can bind Raf (10Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and MEK (26Denouel, A., Douville, E., Warne, P., Papin, C., Calothy, G., Downward, J., Eychène, A., Thirteenth Annual Meeting on Oncogenes, 13, 1997, 22, (abstr.).Google Scholar). A Ras·Raf·MEK complex has been shown to form in mammalian cells in advance of MEK1 activation (27Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Scaffold proteins simultaneously associate with several effectors of a signaling pathway to create an ordered module that facilitates sequential activation of the associated enzymes (28Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a KSR scaffold to a stoichiometry above the level of the available, endogenous catalytic components might prevent the formation of complete and functional signaling modules. Facilitation of Raf activation requires membrane localization of KSR (10Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 12Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Cacace A. Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12792-12796Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Localization of an overexpressed KSR scaffold to the cytosol (Fig. 2 C) might also explain quenching of the ERK MAP kinase signal. Alternatively, a KSR scaffold could incorporate phosphatases or other molecules that deactivate other components of the module (28Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Taken together with previous data, these results support the possibility that KSR could function to modulate the duration and intensity of ERK MAP kinase stimulation. The magnitude of ERK MAP kinase activation controls its subcellular distribution (29Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 30Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 702-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and is the basis for a model that explains how the activation of the same signaling pathway by different growth factor receptors can result in conspicuous differences in cell proliferation and differentiation (31Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar). The data presented here provide experimental evidence and a rationale for the analysis of KSR as an unique modulator of ERK MAP kinase activation with implications for normal and abnormal cell growth and development.

Whittaker are thanked for providing the Myc-tagged RasAsp-12, MEKEE, and human insulin receptor cDNAs, respectively. K. Siddle is thanked for providing antibodies to the human insulin receptor. While this manuscript was under review, papers were published that also demonstrated the ability of KSR to inhibit ERK MAP kinase activity (32Yu W. Fantl W.J. Harrowe G. Williams L.T. Curr.

Barrington E.J.W. Hormones and Evolution. Academic Press, New York1979: 561-642Google Scholar). PRL interacts with specific cell surface receptors expressed on different target tissues (reviewed in Ref. 2Kelly P.A. Ali S. Rozakis-Adcock M. Goujon L. Nagano M. Pellegrini I. Gould D. Djiane J. Edery M. Finidori J. Postel-Vinay M.-C. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 123-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The receptor for PRL (PRLR) belongs to a large group of receptors known as the cytokine/GH/PRL receptor superfamily, which includes the receptors for GH, EPO, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and several interleukins (2Kelly P.A. Ali S. Rozakis-Adcock M. Goujon L. Nagano M. Pellegrini I. Gould D. Djiane J. Edery M. Finidori J. Postel-Vinay M.-C. Recent Prog. Horm.

These receptors share common extracellular structural motifs such as two disulfide loops and intracellular such as the proline-rich Box1 homology domain. These receptors do not possess intrinsic kinase activity but signal through cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase family (Jak/Tyk kinases) and the Src-kinase family. Ligand binding to the cytokine/GH/PRL receptor family induces receptor dimerization and activation of the associated kinases. This leads in turn to tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins including the receptors themselves (4Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The downstream signaling molecules activated by this receptor family have not been completely elucidated. However, it has been shown that several of the SH2 domain containing molecules interact with cytokine receptors, e.g. phospholipid metabolizing enzymes, phospholipase C-γ, and the regulatory unit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2, and adapter proteins Grb2, Shc, and IRS1 (5Boulton T.G.

Moreover, a family of SH2 domain containing transcription factors of 85–95 kDa, called signal transducers and activators of trasncription (Stat), have been identified as primary effector molecules for this receptor family (12Darnell J.E.J. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Rapidly upon receptor activation, tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat factors occurs leading to their homo- or heterodimerization and translocation to the nucleus where they induce transcription of cytokine responsive genes (13Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H.T. Qureshi S. Cowburn D. Darnell J.E.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The complete molecular events leading to Stat proteins activation are not fully understood. It has been suggested that phosphotyrosines on the receptor components may act as docking sites for the SH2 domains of Stat proteins (14Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 15Stahl N. farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), allowing them to be phosphorylated by Jak tyrosine kinase family, a process necessary for Stat proteins activation by cytokine receptors. Recent information, however, indicate that other signaling pathways might be involved for maximal induction of Stat proteins activity. For example, to fully activate Stat1α, serine phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase is required (16Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.C. Schindler C. Chen-kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The rat PRLR, a member of the cytokine/GH/PRL receptor family, exists in three natural forms; the long form, identified in the mammary epithelial and ovarian cells (17Shirota M. Banville D. Ali S. Jolicoeur C. Boutin J.-M. Edery M. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), the short form, characterized in liver cells (18Boutin J.-M. Jolicoeur C. Okamura H. Gagnon J. Edery M. Shirota M. Banville D. Dusanter-Fourt I. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 69-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and a third intermediate form, found in rat T-lymphoma Nb2 cells called PRLR Nb2 form (19Ali S. Pellegrini I. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20110-20117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The short form of the receptor results from alternative splicing of the long form, whereas the Nb2 form results from a deletion mutation of the long form. The membrane-proximal events following PRLR activation have recently been clarified. PRL binding to its receptor triggers homodimerization of the PRLR and activation of the constitutively associated kinase, Jak2 (20Rui H. Lebrun J.J. Kirken R.A. Kelly P.A. Farrar W.L. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1289-1291Google Scholar, 21Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5364-5368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Sofer L. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14021-14026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this process lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of the PRLR long form and the PRLR Nb2 form, no tyrosine phosphorylation was observed for the PRLR short form (23Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10664-10670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies examining the mechanism through which PRLR regulate gene transcription have previously demonstrated that although the PRLR long and the Nb2 forms are able to transmit the signal of PRL to activate β-casein gene transcription, the short form was inactive in this biological assay system (24Ali S. Edery M. Pellegrini I. Lesueur L. Paly J. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1242-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We have further shown that PRLR signals through the coordinated action of Jak2 and a single tyrosine residue present on the PRLR long and Nb2 forms to activate β-casein gene transcription. Indeed, when the C-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR long form (Tyr580) or of the PRLR Nb2 form (Tyr382) was mutated to phenylalanine, signaling of the PRLR to β-casein gene promoter activation was impaired (23Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10664-10670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PRL has recently been shown to activate several Stat proteins such as Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 (23Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10664-10670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26DaSilva L. Rui H, . Erwin R.A. Howard O.M. Kirken R.A. Malabarba M. Hackett R.H. Larner A.C.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In particular, Stat5, for which two isoforms Stat5a and Stat5b differing in their C-terminal tail were characterized in mouse mammary gland (28Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), has been shown to be vital for hormonal induction of β-casein gene transcription in mammary gland of lactating animals (29Liu X. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1496-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and in heterologous cell systems (30Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Stat5 activation has also recently been shown to correlate with mitogenic signaling in response to PRL (31Gilmour K.C. Pine R. Reich N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10772-10776Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, Stat5 appears to be a key player in PRL-induced gene activation and cell proliferation. Stat5 has also been shown to be part of the signaling pathway for a number of cytokine receptors such as GHR, EPOR, IL3-R, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, IL2-R, IL6-gp130, and epidermal growth factor receptor (reviewed in Ref. 32O'Shea J.J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The mechanism of activation of Stat5 through the different cytokine receptors remains elusive and controversial. Indeed, Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation, DNA binding, and induction of transcription via the GHR requires certain phosphotyrosine residues on the receptor (33Sotiropoulos A. Moutoussamy S. Renaudie F. Clauss M. Kayser C. Gouilleux F. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 34Wang, X., Darus, C. J., Xu, B. C., and Kopchick, J. J.Mol. Endocrinol., 10, 1249–1260.Google Scholar). Similarly, Stat5 activation downstream of the EPOR was found to be dependent on receptor phosphotyrosines (35Damen J. Wakao H. Miyajima A. Krosl J. Humphries R.K. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5557-5568Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 36Quelle F.W. Wang D. Nosaka T. Thierfelder W.E. Stravopodis D. Weinstein Y. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1622-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 37Gobert S. Chretien Gouilleux F. Muller O. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Groner B. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2434-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, other studies have reported a mechanism of activation of Stat5 totally independent of receptor phosphotyrosines. For example, GHR phosphotyrosines-independent activation of Stat5 has been documented (38Wang Y.-D. Wong K. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7021-7024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Separate studies indicated that Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation and Stat5-DNA binding activity through the gp130 subunit of the IL-6 receptor (39Fujitani Y. Hibi M. Fukada T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Yoshida H. Yamaguchi T. Sugiyama K. Yamanaka Y. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (40Tian S.S. Tapley P. Sincich C. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Lamb P. Blood. 1996; 88: 4435-4444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is independent of receptor phosphotyrosines. Furthermore, direct Jak-Stat interaction has recently been implicated as an alternative mechanism for activation of Stat5 by cytokine receptors (39Fujitani Y. Hibi M. Fukada T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Yoshida H. Yamaguchi T. Sugiyama K. Yamanaka Y. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).Therefore, the mechanism of activation of Stat5 by the cytokine/GH/PRL receptor family and the possible role of receptor phosphotyrosines in this process remains to be elucidated. In this paper, we examined the significance of tyrosine phosphorylation of the PRLR in activating Stat5 molecules. Our results indicate that although Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation is regulated by PRLR-Jak2 activation, it is independent of PRLR tyrosine phosphorylation. We further found that the C-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR Nb2 form regulates Stat5 nuclear translocation. Together, our results indicate for the first time that Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation are two separately regulated process. Cytomegelovirus-based expression plasmids, pR/CMV vector (Invitogen), containing cDNAs encoding PRLR long wild type, LY237F, LY580F, Nb2 wild type, NbY237, NbY382F, Δ296–322, ΔY237F, and ΔY382F, were constructed as described previously (25Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and were obtained from Dr. P. Kelly (Paris, France). Expression plasmid DNA, pXM-MGF/Stat5, encoding MGF/Stat5 was obtained from Dr. B. Groner (Freiburg, Germany). Ovine PRL (oPRL) used for cell treatment was obtained from Sigma (Mississauga, ON, Canada). Polyclonal antibody to Stat5a and monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (4G10) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), monoclonal antibody to Stat5 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and monoclonal antibody to PRLR, U5, was provided by Dr. P. Kelly (Paris, France). Protein A beads used for immunoprecipitations were purchased from Pharmacia (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). HC11, mouse mammary epithelial cells, were grown to confluency in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), insulin (5 μg/ml), and epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml). Cells were then induced by incubating them for 3–5 days in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, insulin (5 μg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 μm) (41Ball R.K. Zimiecki A. Shoenenberger C.A. Riechmann E. Redmond S.M.S. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 42Doppler W. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 124: 93-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then starved in RPMI medium containing insulin (5 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (1 μm), and transferrin (10 μg/ml). Cells were then stimulated with oPRL (1.5 μg/ml) for the time indicated. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) for 5 min at 4 °C. The lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford technique. Transfection was carried out as described earlier (23Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10664-10670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, the human 293 clone stably expressing the tyrosine kinase Jak2 (clone LA) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Several hours before transfection, cells were plated in a rich medium (two parts Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium and one part Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing glucose at 4.5 g/liter) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Approximately 5 × 106 cells were then co-transfected with the cDNA encoding the different forms of RPLR (1 μg each) and the cDNA for Stat5 (500 ng) by using the calcium phosphate technique. After 24 h of expression, the cells were starved by serum deprivation overnight. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described earlier (22Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Sofer L. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14021-14026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, protein extracts were immunoprecipitated for 2 h using polyclonal antibody to Stat5a and protein A-Sepharose beads. This antibody was used because immunoprecipitations were unsuccessful using the monoclonal antibody to Stat5. Precipitates were then separated on SDS-PAGE and probed with monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosines (4G10) then stripped and reprobed with polyclonal antibody to Stat5a. Transiently co-trasfected 293-LA cells were stimulated with oPRL (1.5 μg/ml) of for 5 min and then lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) for 5 min at 4 °C. The lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford technique. Equal amounts of protein obtained by total lysis were loaded and run on an 8% SDS-PAGE. Western analysis was performed using monoclonal antibodies to phosphotyrosine, PRLR, or Stat5. Proteins were revealed using chemiluminescence (ECL kit from Amersham Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Procedure for obtaining nuclear extracts was described previously (30Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, transiently co-transfected 293-LA cells or HC11 cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were incubated for 15 min and then vortexed vigorously and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then the nuclear extracts were obtained by adding a high salt buffer (25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl,1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin), shaken for 30 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. Total nuclear proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and Western blots were carried out using anti-Stat5 monoclonal antibody and revealed using chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Corp.). EMSA was performed as described elsewhere (30Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. Binding reactions performed in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) contained nuclear extract (8–10 μg), end labeled double stranded DNA containing the Stat5 response element of the β-casein gene promoter (5 pmol) and nonspecific competitor polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycyctidylic acid (2 μg). For supershifts, protein extracts were incubated on ice for 30 min with polyclonal antibody to Stat5a (1 μg). We used this antibody because supershifts were unsuccessful when the monoclonal antibody to Stat5 was used. Samples were run on a 0.25× TBE (45 mm Tris-borate, 1 mm EDTA), 5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C (Hyperfilm, Amersham Corp.). Gene expression of milk proteins in mammary cells is under a complex hormonal control. A combination of insulin, glucocorticoids, and PRL is required for maximal hormonal induction of milk proteins, such as β-casein, in mammary organ and epithelial cell cultures (41Ball R.K. Zimiecki A. Shoenenberger C.A. Riechmann E. Redmond S.M.S. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 42Doppler W. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 124: 93-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stat5 activation has recently been shown to be the main intracellular mediator for activation of β-casein gene promoter (27Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first evaluated the ability of PRL to induce Stat5 activation in HC11 cells, PRL-sensitive mouse mammary epithelial cells (27Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Cells were starved in the presence of insulin and hydrocortisone, were either left untreated or treated with PRL (1.5 μg/ml) for 10 min, and were lysed in lysis buffer. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-Stat5a polyclonal antibody. Immune complexes were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunodetected with monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosines (4G10). As shown in Fig. 1 A, no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 was observed under basal conditions. However, PRL stimulation of cells (10 min) rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5. To confirm that equal amounts of Stat5 were immunoprecipitated, membrane was stripped and reprobed with polyclonal antibodies to Stat5a (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that in mammary cells Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation is induced by PRL treatment. Furthermore, these results indicate that the combinations of insulin and hydrocortisone are not competent to induce Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of PRL. We then examined the kinetics of Stat5 nuclear translocation in HC11 cells in response to PRL stimulation. Cells were grown and stimulated for the indicated times. Cytoplasmic (Fig. 1 C) and nuclear (Fig. 1 D) extracts were then prepared from the same culture. As shown in Fig. 1 D, the amount of Stat5 in the nucleus increases rapidly following PRL stimulation. Meanwhile, the amount of Stat5 present in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 C) decreases until eventually no detectable Stat5 was found in the cytoplasm following 10 min of PRL hormone treatment. We next examined the ability of Stat5 to bind to the β-casein gene promoter. It has been shown previously that Stat5 binds to the −75/−104 region of the β-casein gene promoter (27Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed using a primer of the sequence 5′-TGT GGA CTT CTT GGA ATT AAG GGA C-3′, and nuclear extracts were prepared from unstimulated or PRL-stimulated HC11 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 E, PRL stimulation of HC11 cells results in Stat5 binding to the GAS-like element present on the β-casein gene promoter. This complex was supershifted in the presence of anti-Stat5a polyclonal antibody (third lane), indicating the specificity of the DNA binding activity. All together, using the mammary epithelial cell system, we show here that Stat5 activation in mammary cells follows PRL inductive effects. Having established that PRL regulates Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding activity in mammary cells, we were interested in defining the mechanism through which PRLR mediate this effect. We have previously shown that C-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR is necessary for PRL activation of β-casein gene promoter (25Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When this tyrosine was mutated to phenylalanine in the PRLR Nb2 form, β-casein gene promoter induction was strongly inhibited. Similar mutation of the C-terminal tyrosine on the PRLR long form, however, had less notable effects on β-casein gene activation. To investigate the role of PRLR tyrosine phosphorylation in Stat5 activation, we used a heterologous overexpression system consisting of 293-LA cells, human kidney cell line stably overexpressing Jak2 kinase (23Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10664-10670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that transient overexpression of PRLR in these cells leads to ligand-independent constitutive activation of the receptor-kinase complex. Here we have used this system to investigate the role of PRLR tyrosine phosphorylation in activation of Stat5. The receptor natural and mutant forms used in our studies were described previously (23Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10664-10670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The PRLR Nb2 form, found in Nb2 T-lymphoma cells, has an inframe deletion mutation compared with the PRLR long form (19Ali S. Pellegrini I. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20110-20117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three tyrosine residues (Tyr237, Tyr309, and Tyr382) are retained in the PRLR Nb2 form compared with the PRLR long form. Tyrosine 382 of the PRLR Nb2 form corresponds to tyrosine 580 of the PRLR long form. Another biologically active form is the PRLR Nb2 mutant form Δ296–322 (23Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10664-10670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This receptor form has a 27-amino acid internal deletion and lacks tyrosine 309. Finally, the PRLR Nb2 mutant form Δ243–268 is also used in our studies (23Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10664-10670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This mutant form is missing a 25-amino acid region encompassing the"

This cDNA encodes a protein of 1505 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 170,972 Da. The amino acid sequence of PI3K-IIγ is highly similar to those of class II PI 3-kinases, including murine Cpk-m/p170 and human HsC2-PI3K. It contains a C2 domain at the C terminus but no recognizable protein motifs at its N terminus. PI3K-IIγ displays a restricted substrate specificity for PtdIns and PtdIns 4-P, but not for PtdIns 4,5-P2. By epitope tag immunocytochemistry, the immunoreactivity for PI3K-IIγ is localized in the juxtanuclear Golgi region at high levels and also in the plasma and nuclear membranes at low levels. By Northern blot analysis and in situhybridization histochemistry, PI3K-IIγ mRNA expression is confined to the liver throughout the development with much higher expression in adult liver than in fetal liver. In addition, its expression increases during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy with maximal expression after the growth period, suggesting that PI3K-IIγ may function mainly in highly differentiated hepatic cells.

Although the intracellular level of PtdIns 3-P is largely unaltered following extracellular stimuli, the other two phosphoinositides are almost absent in unstimulated cells but accumulate in response to a variety of external agonists (1Auger K.R.

Nature. 1991; 351: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Since initial identification of the molecular structure of PI 3-kinase as a form of heterodimer,i.e. a complex composed of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (3Carpenter C.L.

Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cDNA cloning analyses have revealed multiple catalytic subunits of this kinase family which can now be classified into three classes on the basis of their structural characteristics and in vitro lipid substrate specificity. The class I PI 3-kinases, which have so far been reported to be composed of p110α, β, γ, and δ, catalyze the phosphorylation of all PtdIns, PtdIns 4-P, and PtdIns 4,5-P2 (4Hiles I.D. Otsu M.

The class III PI 3-kinase represents a human homologue of yeast PtdIns 3-kinase, Vps34, which is involved in trafficking of proteins from the Golgi to vacuoles. This class III PI 3-kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation solely of PtdIns (13Volinia S. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. MacDougall L.K. Stein R. Zvelebil M.J. Domin J. Panaretou C. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3339-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Earlier studies focused on the role of PI 3-kinases in growth factor-stimulated and tyrosine kinase receptor-mediated cascades (reviewed in Ref. 14Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: M11-M16PubMed Google Scholar), but recent studies support the involvement of this lipid kinase in inhibition of apoptosis, intracellular vesicle trafficking, and regulation of cytoskeletal functions in addition to mitogenic signaling (reviewed in Refs. 15Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar and 16Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The liver may be an advantageous tissue to examine because of the following two facts: 1) the developing liver is relatively large, which makes it easy to obtain sufficient amounts of mRNA for molecular analysis, and 2) a recent gene knockout study has shown that the embryonic development of liver is severely retarded by mutation of hepatocyte growth factor whose effects on cellular functions mediated by the c-Met tyrosine kinase receptor includes induction of PI 3-kinase activity (17Schmidt C.

Moreover, the regenerating liver remnant after partial hepatectomy represents a typical model for active mitogenesis in the adult, and there has been evidence that PI 3-kinase activity is markedly enhanced in response to the hepatectomy (19Sasaki Y. Zhang X.F. Nishiyama M. Avruch J. Wands J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3805-3808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study addressed this issue and was undertaken to identify a novel liver-specific PI 3-kinase species by cDNA cloning from the cDNA library of regenerating rat liver. The molecular structure of a novel class II PI 3-kinase and its detailed biochemical characteristics are clarified in this report. Regenerating liver was prepared from partially hepatectomized rats 24 h after the removal of two-thirds of liver mass according to the method of Higgins and Anderson (20Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared by the guanidine method, and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by chromatography on an oligo(dT)-cellulose column. First strand cDNA was prepared using First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oligonucleotide primers corresponding to two regions of highly conserved amino acid sequences in PI kinase domains, (V/T)GDD(C/L)RQ (5′-CGGAATTCCGG(A/T/C)GA(T/C)GA(T/C)T(G/T)(T/C)CG(G/C)CA(G/A)GA-3′) and HIDFGF (I/M) (5′-CGGAATTCAT(G/A)AA(G/A/T)CC(G/A)TC(G/A)AT(G/A)TG-3′) were used for PCR amplification as sense and antisense primers. The 5′ ends of both primers contained an EcoRI restriction site (underlined). PCR amplification was performed using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 42 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles. The reaction products of approximately 400 base pairs were then subcloned and sequenced. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library from the regenerating liver of 49-day-old (P49) rat was constructed in the same way as described previously (21Goto K. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yuasa H. Sakane F. Kanoh H. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Clones (approximately 2×106) derived from the cDNA library were screened by hybridization with the 400-base pair PCR products labeled with [32P]dCTP. A positive bacteriophage containing a 1.4-kb insert was isolated. The insert (pF3K4) was cloned into pBluescript, and the sequence was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method with a 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) according to the instructions of the supplier. The missing 5′ end was obtained by a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using two gene-specific antisense primers, (5′-CGCACAGGGCCGGGTTCAGAGGAAGATG-3′) and (5′-ACCGTGAAGCTCAGGTGGGAGTGGAGCC-3′), with the Marathon sense primer in PCR amplifications (Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit,CLONTECH). The missing 3′ end was amplified using the gene-specific sense primer (5′-CTCGCACCATGAGAGAATCCGAGATCTG-3′) and the antisense primer (5′ -TGGAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCAG- 3′) corresponding to the sequence of NotI (dT)18 primer which contained a NotI restriction site (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). At least five overlapping RACE products were subcloned and completely sequenced as described above. A NotI site was introduced by PCR at the position of the initiation codon of a newly identified cDNA using the primer (5′-GCGGCCGCCAAAAATGGCATACAATTGGC-3′). ResultingNotI fragments were ligated to the same site of the expression vector, pSRE (pcDL-SRα 296 in Ref. 22Tanabe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Sakane et al. (23Sakane F. Imai S. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). At the same time, FLAG marker peptide, Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys (Kodak Co.), was fused upstream of the initiation codon, ATG, of the cDNA for the newly identified molecule. FLAG-tagged molecule was recovered as described below from COS-7 cells 3 days after the transfection by the DEAE-dextran method (24Okayama H. Kawauchi M. Brownstein M. Lee F. Yokota T. Arai K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 2-28Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 15 min), and its protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowryet al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG antibody-agarose beads (approximately 20 μl of beads/1 mg of lysate) for 90 min. The resulting beads were washed repeatedly and resuspended in assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2). A volume of 10 μl of the beads recovered from 100 μg of the transfected cell lysates was then used for PI kinase assay. After 10 min of incubation with lipid substrates (200 μm each of PtdIns, PtdIns 4-P, and PtdIns 4,5-P2) mixed with an equal amount of phosphatidylserine, the reaction was carried out for an additional 10 min in the presence of 40 μm ATP containing 12.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Various concentrations of wortmannin or detergents (Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, or CHAPS) were added to the reaction buffer. Alternatively, 3.5 mm Mn2+ was added instead of Mg2+. Reaction products were extracted and resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using Silica Gel 60 plates (Whatman). For determination of the phosphorylated position on the inositol ring, reaction products were resolved using TLC with a borate buffer system as described by Walsh et al. (26Walsh J.P. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9184-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As reference, [γ-32P]PtdIns 3-P was produced by phosphorylating PtdIns with A431 cell lysate, which had been reported to contain a high level of PI 3-kinase activity (27Miller E.S. Ascoli M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]PtdIns 4-P was produced by phosphorylating PtdIns with the immunoprecipitates of FLAG-tagged 92-kDa PtdIns 4-kinase that we isolated from rat brain (28Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For separation of PtdIns 3-P, PtdIns 3,4-P2, and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3, the products were resolved by TLC in a buffer consisting of chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (80/30/26/24/14). Poly(A)+ RNAs were purified from liver, testis, brain, heart, lung, and spleen of the P49 rat, livers of prenatal day 18 (E18) rat, and from regenerating livers of P49 rats on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day after partial hepatectomy (PH1, PH2, and PH3, respectively) as described above. Each of the poly(A)+ RNA samples (2 or 5 μg) was denatured with formamide and size-separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The RNAs were transferred and fixed to a nylon membrane (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell) and hybridized with a [32P]dCTP-labeled probe prepared from a 6-kbNotI restriction fragment of a novel cDNA. Conditions for hybridization and washing were performed as described previously (21Goto K. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yuasa H. Sakane F. Kanoh H. Mol.

Fresh frozen blocks of livers and brains from adult (P49) and 7-day-old (P7) rats, whole bodies of fetal (E15 and E18) rats, and regenerating livers of P49 rats after partial hepatectomy (PH1, PH2, and PH3) were sectioned at 30 μm thickness on a cryostat. The sections were hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C with [35S]dATP-labeled oligonucleotides (5′-GGCTCACTCTGTAGTGTCATGCTGAGAAGCCTAGACCCCAGCGGA-3′ (nucleotides 1944–1988)). After hybridization, the sections were rinsed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% Sarkosyl at 42 °C for 20 min, three times in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% Sarkosyl at 42 °C for 1 h, and dehydrated in 70 and 100% ethanol. For comparison in relative hybridization intensity, targeted tissue sections were all mounted on one glass slide and exposed to a Hyperfilm-β max (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 weeks. The tissues and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.01% Triton X-100 and were incubated with the anti-FLAG antibodies (Anti-FLAG M2, Kodak). Sites of antigen-antibody reaction were visualized using the avidin-biotin complex system (Vector Laboratories) with diaminobentidine as a substrate. In the immunoblotting, the lysates of overexpressed cells were collected by centrifugation (550 ×g, 10 min), and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to separate soluble and particulate fractions. The proteins of both fractions were subjected to SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with anti-FLAG antibodies and treated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies for 1 h. The deduced amino acid sequences of the composite cDNA of the novel molecule are presented in Fig. 1. The putative initiation codon was preceded by in-frame stop codon at nucleotide −57. The predicted open reading frame encoded a protein of 1505 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 170,972 Da. When the sequences of the extreme 3′ and 5′ ends of the composite cDNA were used in the PCR amplification, a full-length cDNA of the same size was amplified, and its sequence was identical to that of the composite cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence of the novel molecule contained a lipid kinase unique domain, a putative catalytic domain, and a C2 domain as found previously for murine Cpk-m/p170 and human HsC2-PI3K (9Brown R.A.

The novel molecule showed 48, 42, and 30% identities to HsC2-PI3K, Cpk-m/p170, and p110α in the lipid kinase unique domain and 59, 57, and 42% identities to the three individual kinases in the catalytic domain, respectively. The C2 domain of the novel molecule was located at the C terminus, and it was 40 and 32% identical to the same domain of HsC2-PI3K and Cpk-m/p170, respectively. The N terminus of the novel molecule did not contain any recognizable protein motifs (Fig. 2).Figure 2A, schematic representation of the protein structure of PI3K-IIγ.

A smaller transcript of approximately 2.5 kb was detected at a low level in the heart and testis, which was considered to be a result of alternative splicing. No significant hybridization band was discerned in the brain, lung, spleen, or kidney (Fig. 3 A). The expression was detectable, though weakly, in E18 liver, and the expression level of P49 liver was approximately 10-fold higher than that of E18 liver (Fig. 3 B). During liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, the mRNA expression showed a pattern of time-dependent gradual increase, and it increased markedly on the 3rd day after hepatectomy (PH3) (Fig. 3 C). The expression level of PH3 was superficially 3-fold higher and 1.6-fold higher than that of non-operated control (PH0), even after normalizing it to GAPDH mRNA expression, although a previous study has shown a slight increase in GAPDH mRNA during liver regeneration after hepatectomy (29Goldswothy S.M. Goldworthy T.L. Sprankle C.S. Butterworth B.E. Cell Prolif. 1993; 26: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which was also confirmed by us. By in situ hybridization histochemistry of the whole body of embryos on E15 and E18 and of liver and brain on P7 and P49, the expression signals for this novel molecule were detected only in the liver, and no significant signals were detected in any other tissues of embryos and the postnatal brain (Fig. 4). Detection of the lipid kinase activity of the novel molecule was performed using immunoprecipitates from lysates of COS-7 cells transfected with the corresponding epitope-tagged cDNA. A single band at an approximate size of 190 kDa was visualized by silver staining on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 5 A). A single immunoreactive band of the same size was detected at almost equal intensities in both soluble and particulate fractions (Fig. 5 B). In an assay for lipid kinase activity using PtdIns as a substrate, the selective production of [32P]PtdIns 3-P, but not [32P]PtdIns 4-P, was clearly revealed, compared with immunoprecipitates from lysates of cells transfected with cDNAs for 92-kDa PtdIns 4-kinase (28Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) as well as lysates of A431 cells, which are known to have high intrinsic activities for both PtdIns 3-kinase and PtdIns 4-kinase (27Miller E.S. Ascoli M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 C). When PtdIns 4-P and PtdIns 4,5-P2 were used as substrates, the formation of [32P]PtdIns 3,4-P2 was detected, whereas no formation of [32P]PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 was discerned (Fig. 5 D). The kinase activity was inhibited by wortmannin with an IC50 of 12 nm, whereas the PI 3-kinase activity of A431 cell lysates was inhibited with an IC50 of 5 nm under the same conditions. The kinase activity was also inhibited almost completely by addition of 0.5% Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40 or CHAPS, or in the presence of 3.5 mm Mn2+ instead of Mg2+ (data not shown). When COS-7 cells were transfected with the epitope (FLAG)-tagged cDNA for the novel molecule and immunostained for the FLAG-tag, immunoreactive cells accounted for about 20% of the total cell populations and appeared randomly dispersed in each culture dish. The immunoreactive products were densely aggregated in juxtaposition to the cell nuclei. In addition, the contours of the cell nuclei and cell boundary appeared clearly delineated (Fig. 6). When the transfection was made with a cDNA without the tag, no immunoreactivity was detected (data not shown). Judging from the presence of a C2 domain in its molecular structure as well as its substrate specificity for PtdIns and PtdIns 4-P in vitro and inhibition of its kinase activity by wortmannin and Mn2+, it is clear that this novel molecule represents the third species of class II PI 3-kinase in vertebrates. But it is the first vertebrate species whose biochemical characteristics and localization in tissues and cells have been revealed in detail (9Brown R.A. Ho L.K.F. Wever-Hall S.J. Shipley J.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13304-13307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The novel molecule is thus termed as PI3K-IIγ, and we propose to name the previous molecules, murine cpk-m/p170 and human HsC2-PI3K, as PI3K-IIα and -IIβ, respectively. Among several short cDNA clones reported in a recent study of novel PI 3-kinases, a partial amino acid sequence of one of their clones is found to be a presumed human homologue of PI3K-IIγ (30Ho L.K.F. Liu D. Rozycka M. Brown R.A. Fry M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The appearance of PI3K-IIγ in both supernatant and particulate fractions, together with the absence of any transmembrane domains in its deduced amino acid sequence, suggests that translocation of PI3K-IIγ occurs between the two intracellular components although the molecular mechanism of the translocation remains to be determined. The present immunohistochemical analysis of COS-7 cells overexpressed with PI3K-IIγ shows that the immunoreactivity for PI3K-IIγ is localized in the juxtanuclear Golgi region with the highest intensity and, furthermore, in the nuclear and plasma membranes at low levels. Whether or not the localization of the immunoreactivity in the juxtanuclear Golgi region by light microscopy represents the localization of this molecule in the Golgi apparatus itself or in both the Golgi and adjacent endoplasmic reticulum requires further double immunocytochemical analysis using specific antisera against the two organelles. It will also be necessary to use a specific antibody against PI3K-IIγ to examine whether the present immunohistochemical finding represents the real localization or reflects the artificially high production of PI3K-IIγ protein in such cells. The present study reveals that the gene expression of PI3K-IIγ is confined to the liver at both prenatal and postnatal stages, with the latter at a much higher level. In addition, its expression increases during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in a time-dependent manner. Haber et. al. has recently defined three chronological patterns of expression for various genes in the regenerating liver after hepatectomy. The first pattern parallels the major growth period of the liver that ends at 60–72 h after hepatectomy. The second has two peaks coincident with the first and second G1 phases of the two hepatic cell cycles. In the third pattern, the expression level reaches the maximum at 72 h, which is maintained for a substantial length thereafter (31Haber B.A. Mohn K.L. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The induction pattern of PI3K-IIγ mRNA after partial hepatectomy is similar to the third pattern. These results may suggest that PI3K-IIγ is not involved in the major mitogenic signaling pathway but is involved in other pathways responsible for some yet undefined liver-specific matured functions, in contrast to the expectation mentioned in the introduction. C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α) represents one of the molecules exhibiting the third pattern of the gene expression in the regenerating liver and is expressed late in gestation and highly in the nongrowing normal adult liver (32McKnight S.L. Lane M.D. Gluecksohn-Waelsch S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2021-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 33Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). C/EBPα has also been shown to activate the transcription of several tissue-specific genes such as insulin-responsive glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in a coordinated fashion (34Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Lane M.D. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 35Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L. Thatcher J.D. Shuman J. Friedman A. Hanson R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6264-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The functional relation of PI3K-IIγ to C/EBPα in the liver remains to be evaluated. With the regard to the possible functional significance of PI3K-IIγ in matured cells, it should be noted that the axonal crush was shown in our recent study to induce the enhanced gene expression of a class I PI 3-kinase in hypoglossal motoneurones which represent the non-mitotic cell population (36Ito Y. Sakagami H. Kondo H. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We have also shown in crushed/axotomized motoneurones the enhanced gene expression of a serine/threonine protein kinase, Akt/PKB, which is activated by PtdIns 3,4-P2, but not by PtdIns 3,4,5-P3. PtdIns 3,4-P2 is a direct product of the class II PI 3-kinase from PtdIns 4-P although it is also a product of the hydrolysis at the d-5 position of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 which is produced by class-I PI 3-kinase (37Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). To understand the physiological role of PI3K-IIγ in non-mitotic signaling in hepatic cells, further studies will be needed such as a search for agonists that may induce enhanced activation of PI3K-IIγ and for proteins that may modulate the action of this molecule.

Prostaglandin synthesis and release by amnion cells in response to hormones and ligands takes place after a characteristic 4–5 h lag. However, we report herein that free arachidonic acid (AA), the metabolic precursor of prostaglandins, can be induced at much shorter times (1 h) in human amnionic WISH cells by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) through activation of protein kinase Cα (PKCα). WISH cells were found to possess both cytosolic group IV phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and Group VI Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2(iPLA2). Of these, the cPLA2 was found to be the likely mediator of AA mobilization in PMA-activated WISH cells. PMA also activates phospholipase D (PLD) in these cells and ethanol, a compound that inhibits PLD-mediated phosphatidic acid (PA) formation, blocked AA release. Moreover, prevention of PA dephosphorylation by the PA phosphohydrolase inhibitors propranolol and bromoenol lactone, resulted in inhibition of AA release by PMA-treated WISH cells. Collectively, these data suggest that activation of cPLA2and attendant AA release by phorbol esters in WISH cells requires prior generation of DAG by phosphatidate phosphohydrolase.

Those include five groups of small secreted PLA2s, which show millimolar requirements for Ca2+ (Groups I, II, III, V, and X), and two groups of intracellular, high molecular weight enzymes (Groups IV and VI). Group IV PLA2, or cPLA2, is Ca2+-dependent and a highly regulated enzyme (4Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar); whereas, Group VI PLA2, or iPLA2, is Ca2+-independent (5Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Among these PLA2s, Groups II, V, and IV have been shown to be the responsible enzymes for prostaglandin generation in different systems (6Barbour S.E. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

On the other hand, Group VI PLA2 has been implicated in basal fatty acid remodeling reactions (5Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

PGs, especially PGE2 and PGF2α, are thought to play a central role in the initiation of spantaneous labor in humans by mediating physiological effects such as uterine contractions (10Embrey M.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 180: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and cervical softening and effacement (11Calder A.A. Karim S.M.M. Practical Applications of Prostaglandins and their Synthesis Inhibitors. MTP Press, Lancaster, England1979: 301-318Crossref Google Scholar). The human amnion has the capacity of producing PGE2, and it is known that changes in this capacity occur in association with parturition (12Okazaki T. Casey M.L. Okita J.R. MacDonald P.C. Johnson J.M. Am. J Obstet. Gynecol. 1981; 139: 373-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, numerous studies have focused on PG production by amnionic cells, mostly at the level of PG synthase enzymes (13Hulkower K.I. Otis E.R. Li J. Ennis B.W. Cugier D.J. Bell R.L. Carter G.W.

Surprisingly however, the study of PLA2 in amnion cells has received much less attention. Myatt and co-workers (16Xue S. Brockman D.E. Slater D.M. Myatt L. Prostaglandins. 1995; 49: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Xue S. Slatter D.M. Bennett P.R. Myatt L.

These studies were conducted at late stages of activation (several hours). Unfortunately, no information is available on the events that occur immediately after amnionic cell activation (i.e. up to 1 h). In the current study, we have investigated the signaling mechanisms that operate at the early stages of WISH cell activation and lead to increased PLA2 activity and concomitant AA release. Human WISH cells (established amnion cell line) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (endotoxin <0.05 ng/ml) was from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Labs. (Logan, UT).

Group IV cPLA2 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Ruth Kramer (Lilly Research Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN). The sPLA2 inhibitor LY311727 was kindly provided by Dr. Edward Mihelich (Lilly Research Laboratories). Rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK-2 that recognizes p42 and p44 MAPKs were a generous gift from Dr. Alan Saltiel (Parke-Davis, Ann Arbor, MI). Methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) was from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). Antibodies against PKCα, PKCβ, and PKCε and the polyconal anti-Raf-1 antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against PKCγ, PKCδ, and PKCζ were purchased from Calbiochem. WISH cells (18Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 23: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium suplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere at 90% air and 10% CO2. The cells were subcultured twice weekly by trypsinization and, when used for experiments, were seeded into 24-well (2 × 105cells/well, NUNC) or 12-well plates (5 × 105cells/well, Corning Inc.), or 100 × 20-mm dishes (2.5 × 106 cells/dish, Falcon). After a 2-day growth, the cells, at 90% confluency, were rinsed with serum-free medium and incubated for 1–2 h before stimulation. Ca2+-dependent PLA2assay was conducted as described by Kramer et al. (20Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J. Putnam J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5268-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, aliquots of WISH cell homogenates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and sonicated liposomes consisting of 2 μm1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1 μm 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol. Products were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography using the systemn-hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1). To measure Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity, aliquots of WISH cell homogenates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.8 mmATP, 400 μm Triton X-100, 100 mm1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, in a final volume of 500 μl. The substrate was used in the form of mixed micelles of Triton X-100/phospholipid at a molar ratio 4:1, obtained by a combination of heating, vortex mixing, and water bath sonication (21Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11738-11740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Products were analyzed by thin-layer chtomatography using the same system described above. Radiolabeling of the cells with [3H]AA was achieved by including 0.5 μCi [3H]/106 cells in the culture medium 20 h before stimulation. Cells were stimulated with PMA (25–50 ng/ml) for different periods of time in the presence of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free). The supernatants were removed and cleared of detached cells by centrifugation, and radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation. When inhibitors were used, they were added to the cells 30 min before PMA was added to the medium. A Promega kit (PKC assay system, V5910) was used for this purpose, and the manufacturer instructions were followed. Briefly, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 0.5 ml of extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm PMSF) at 4 °C, and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were passed through a 1-ml column of DEAE cellulose pre-equilibrated with the extraction buffer. PKC was extracted by using the extraction buffer plus 200 mm NaCl. PKC activity was then measured with a biotinylated peptide substrate of PKC that binds to Streptavidin-disks. PKC was assayed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 30 μg/ml DAG, 25 μm EGTA, 400 μmCaCl2, and [γ-32P]ATP (5000 pmol, 100–200 cpm/pmol). Reactions were run with and without phospholipids and stopped by adding 7.5 m guanidine-HCl. Aliquots from the reactions were spotted in streptavidin-disks and washed with 1m NaCl, and radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. Experiments were carried out as described elsewhere (20Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J. Putnam J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5268-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated in 100-mm dishes. Control and PMA-stimulated WISH cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mmEDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 20 μm leupeptin, 20 μm aprotinin, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5. Homogenates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to separate soluble and membrane fractions. Membranes were washed with buffer, resuspended, and sonicated. After protein quantification, 100 μg were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel) and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Western blotting analysis was performed by using specific antibodies against PKC isoforms. The cells were labeled with [3H]palmitic acid (3 μCi/106 cells) for 20 h, and the stimulations were carried out in the presence of 1% ethanol. At the end of the reactions, total lipids were extracted (21Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol.

The lipids were identified by comparison with authentic standards run in the same plate and visualized by iodine vapors. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were labeled overnight with either [3H]palmitic acid (3 μCi/106 cells) or [3H]arachidonic acid (0.5 μCi/106 cells), washed, and were incubated with inhibitors for 30 min prior to stimulation with 25–50 ng/ml PMA. At the indicated times, supernatants were removed, cell monolayers were scraped, and total lipids were extracted (22Balboa M.A. Firestein B.L. Godson C.A Bell K.S. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10511-10516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For separation of DAG, lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography with n-hexane/diethyl ether/water (70:30:1, v/v/v). The plates were run twice in this system if monoacylglycerol determination was required as well. Radioactivity in DAG and monoacylglycerol was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h, preincubated with 100 μmpropranolol for 30 min, and stimulated with 25–50 ng/ml PMA for 1 h. Cells were washed and then lysed in a buffer consisting of 1 mm Hepes, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin at 4 °C. Protein was quantified, and a 100-μg aliquot was analyzed by Western blot under conditions previously described (23Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), with antibodies against ERK-2 that recognizes both p42 and p44 MAPKs or against PLA2isoforms. One of the best established systems for the study of lipid mediators in amnionic cells is the human-derived cell line WISH (24Frenkel R.A. Johnston J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19186-19191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line was established from altered colonies appearing in a subculture of a primary monolayer of amnion cells (18Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 23: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Kniss D.A. Mershon J. Su H.-C. Sonek J. Fertel R.H. Wasman M. Iams J.D. Gabbe S.G. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1990; 163: 1883-1890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). WISH cells produce large amounts of PGs after prolonged exposure to phorbol esters (18 h) (13Hulkower K.I. Otis E.R. Li J. Ennis B.W. Cugier D.J. Bell R.L. Carter G.W. Glaser K.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 1065-1074PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J. Putnam J.E. J. Biol.

Gynecol. 1988; 159: 1385-1389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To characterize the steps in the regulation of PG production that occur during the early stages of WISH cell activation, we measured [3H]AA release in these cells after incubation with 50 ng/ml PMA for different time periods (Fig. 1 A). After a time lag of approximately 30 min, significant release of [3H]AA was observed at 60 min, reaching a plateau at about 75 min. Typically, a 2–5-fold increase over basal unstimulated release was detected at an optimal PMA concentration of 25 ng/ml (Fig. 1 B). As a first approach, in vitro measurements of PLA2 activity in homogenates from stimulatedversus unstimulated cells were conducted to identify the phospholipase A2 involved in PMA-stimulated AA release. As shown in Fig. 2 A, WISH cell homogenates exhibited both Ca2+-dependent and -independent PLA2 activity. Interestingly, the Ca2+-dependent PLA2 activity was increased by a little bit less than 2-fold in homogenates from PMA-treated cells as compared with control unstimulated cell homogenates; whereas, Ca2+-independent PLA2activity did not change (Fig. 2 A). These data suggest that the PLA2 mediating PMA-induced AA mobilization is Ca2+-dependent. In keeping with these data, PMA-induced AA release by PMA was inhibited by the presence of 2 mm EGTA in the incubation medium, (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating that Ca2+ is an important regulatory element in this system. We did not detect any increase in iPLA2protein content in WISH cells or in the membrane fraction after 1 h of treatment with PMA (data not shown). There are two types of Ca2+-dependent PLA2 in mammalian cells, i.e. the secretory enzymes (sPLA2s) and the cytosolic Group IV PLA2 (cPLA2). An easy method for distinguishing them is to use specific inhibitors for each of these enzymes, as we have done previously in macrophages (26Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Thus the effect of MAFP and LY311727, specific inhibitors of both cPLA2 and sPLA2, respectively, on PMA-stimulated AA release was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3, MAFP strongly inhibited PMA-induced AA release, suggesting involvement of the cPLA2. On the other hand, LY311727, at concentrations up to 50 μm, was totally unable to affect the response (data not shown), ruling out a role for sPLA2 in PMA-induced AA release in WISH cells. Consistent with the latter, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we have not detected significant levels of mRNA for either Group II or Group V sPLA2s in WISH cells, whether resting or treated with PMA. 2B. Johansen and E. A. Dennis, unpublished data. However, both the Group IV cPLA2 and the Group VI iPLA2 were easily detectable by immunoblot (see below). The effect of BEL on PMA-induced AA release was examined, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 A. BEL was previously identified as a potent iPLA2 inhibitor (5Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), but more recent results have demonstrated its lack of specificity for iPLA2 in cells, as BEL also potently inhibits another key enzyme in lipid metabolism, i.e. the Mg2+-dependent PA phosphohydrolase (PAP) (27Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In fact, the inhibitory effect of BEL on PMA-induced AA release shown in Fig. 4 A cannot be attributed to iPLA2inhibition on the basis of the results presented in Fig. 2 A, which show that the iPLA2 activity does not change upon PMA treatment while the cPLA2 activity does. Moreover, BEL inhibited the PMA-induced DAG production in cells labeled with [3H]palmitic acid (Fig. 4 B), indicating that BEL is indeed inhibiting the PAP. Thus, the possibility arises that the BEL effect on AA release is due to PAP inhibition. To investigate this possibility, we employed propranolol, a well established PAP inhibitor. Analogous to BEL, propranolol appreciably inhibited the PMA-induced [3H]AA release (Fig. 5 A) and [3H]palmitate-labeled DAG production (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5A, effect of propranolol on AA release.B, effect of propranolol (100 μm) on DAG levels. The cells were pretreated with different concentrations of propranolol for 30 min and then stimulated with 25 ng/ml PMA (closed circles) or vehicle (open circles) for 75 min. Free AA and DAG were quantified as described under “Materials and Methods.” AA release was measured in cells prelabeled with [3H]AA. DAG was measured in cells prelabeled with [3H]palmitic acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) One major route for the production of the PA to be used by PAP is the PLD-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids (28Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 A shows that, in the presence of ethanol, PMA induced the time-dependent accumulation of PEt in WISH cells, reflecting PLD activation. PEt is a specific product of PLD action in the presence of ethanol. Accumulation of PEt was detected at much earlier time points than AA release (i.e.15 min), suggesting the possibility that products of PLD may be implicated in cPLA2 activation and attendant AA release. Should this be the case, one would expect that addition of exogenous PLD to the WISH cells would mimic the activating effect of PMA on AA release. Fig. 6, B and C, shows that treatment of the WISH cells with exogenous PLD produced a time- and dose-dependent release of [3H]AA. PLD activation by PMA was unaffected by BEL, confirming that PLD is upstream of the BEL-sensitive step, i.e. the PAP (data not shown). A third, indirect strategy to inhibit the effect of the PAP activity is to use ethanol. By forming PEt instead of PA via phospholipase D, this alcohol depletes the substrate for PAP, thereby impairing DAG production by this route. The overall effect is thus the same as if PAP was directly inhibited. Consistent with the data with BEL and propranolol, ethanol induced a dose-dependent decrease in the PMA-induced AA release (Fig. 7). Collectively, the use of three distinct approaches to inhibit PAP activity have yielded the same result, thus underscoring the critical role that PAP plays in the chain of events leading to cPLA2 activation by PMA and, hence, to AA release in WISH cells. The possibility that PAP-derived DAG is serving itself as a substrate for the AA release via DAG lipase was first investigated by using the DAG lipase specific inhibitor RHC80267. This compound, at concentrations up to 100 μm, did not affect the PMA-induced AA release (not shown). However, the inhibitor slightly raised both basal and activated DAG levels in [3H]AA labeled-cells (Fig. 8 A), indicating that the drug indeed prevents DAG breakdown. Examination of the time course of accumulation of DAG and MAG in [3H]AA-labeled cells did not reveal any significant variation in the levels of these two metabolites up to 60 min after PMA addition, a time point at which AA release is well underway (cf. Figs.1 A and 8, B and C). Activation of PKC, particularly the α isoform, has previously been shown to constitute a major route for PLD activation in a wide variety of cell types (22Balboa M.A. Firestein B.L. Godson C.A Bell K.S. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10511-10516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Exton J.H. J. Biol.

WISH cells express PKCα, ε, δ, and ζ. 3M. A. Balboa and E. A. Dennis, unpublished data. Of them, only PKCα was translocated to the membrane fraction after cellular activation with PMA (Fig. 9 A). The translocation took place very early, being observed at 5 min and disappearing completely from the cytosolic fraction after 30 min of stimulation. To assess whether or not PKCα translocation to the membrane fraction was mediated by PAP-derived DAG, experiments were conducted in the presence of BEL. BEL affected neither PKCα binding to the membrane (Fig. 9 B) nor PKC activity, as measuredin vitro using a commercial kit (PKC assay system V5910, Promega) (data not shown). Like BEL, propranolol did not have any effect on PKCα translocation (data not shown). Involvement of PKCα in PMA-induced AA release was confirmed by the use of the inhibitor Gö7874, specific for Ca2+-dependent isoforms, which inhibited [3H]AA release (Fig. 9 C). PMA-induced signaling events have been shown to include activation of p42/p44MAPK downstream of PKCα (30Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). In keeping with this notion, PMA was able to induce a mobility shift on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating phosphorylation and activation of these kinases. cPLA2, which in some instances lies downstream of p42/p44MAPK (4Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), also experienced a mobility shift after PMA treatment (Fig. 10). Interestingly, after BEL or propranolol treatment, conditions that decrease AA release, the MAPK and cPLA2 mobility shifts were not prevented (Fig. 10). In fact, even in the absence of PMA, both inhibitors were able to induce a cPLA2 mobility shift. Moreover, neither BEL nor propranolol affected the intrinsic activity of the cPLA2 as measured in homogenates from PMA-treated cells (26; data not shown). These data indicate that inhibition of AA mobilization by PAP blockers is not due to inhibition of the signaling mechanism through which the cPLA2 increases its intrinsic specific activity,i.e. phosphorylation by MAPKs. Very little is known about how free AA levels are regulated in the amnion, the PLA2s responsible for such a regulation, and the molecular mechanisms involved. In the present study, we have uncovered phosphatidate phosphohydrolase as a novel regulatory element within the signaling cascade that results in cPLA2activation and AA release during the early stages of activation of the amnionic-like cell line, WISH. BEL has recently been used as a tool to investigate whether the iPLA2 has a role in AA mobilization in different cell types, as this inhibitor possesses over 1000-fold selectivity for the iPLA2 among other PLA2 forms (31Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, BEL also inhibits the magnesium-dependent PAP (26Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 32Dillon D.A Chen X. Zeimetz G.M. Wu W.I. Waggoner D.W. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10361-10366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In P388D1 cells, the IC50 for inhibition by BEL of the PAP is 8 μm, i.e. almost identical to that for inhibition of iPLA2 in the same cells (21Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11738-11740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have found that BEL appreciably blunts AA release in activated WISH cells; however, it blunts DAG production as well, demonstrating that the drug is affecting the PAP in addition to any effect on the iPLA2. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of BEL on AA release herein reported appear to be a consequence of PAP inhibition, since blockage of this enzyme by two other unrelated strategies,i.e. (i) direct inhibition of the enzyme by propranolol and (ii) PAP substrate depletion by ethanol, gave the same inhibitory effect on AA release. Moreover, unlike the cPLA2, the iPLA2 specific activity does not increase after cell stimulation. Our recent attempts at inhibiting iPLA2expression by using antisense mRNA technology in WISH cells, similar to those succesfully used in P388D1 macrophages (33Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29317-29321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), have failed to detect any effect on AA release, which reinforces the notion that the iPLA2 is not an effector in this process. 4M. A. Balboa, J. Balsinde, and E. A. Dennis, unpublished data. It should be noted, however, that unlike P388D1 cells, the WISH cells express very high levels of iPLA2 protein, as judged by immunoblot analysis (results not shown). Collectively, the aforementioned results constitute, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence implicating PAP and the metabolite it produces, DAG, in the regulation of AA mobilization. Since PAP is usually coupled to PLD, as is the case in WISH cells as well, and PLD uses phosphatidylcholine as a preferred substrate, it seems logical to assume that the DAG involved in cPLA2 activation in WISH cells arises mainly from phosphatidylcholine. Besides the identification of PAP as an important regulator of the AA release response in WISH cells, another striking feature of the current work is the finding that none of the PAP-inhibition strategies used resulted in alteration of the intrinsic activity of the cPLA2, as measured by both phosphorylation and in vitro activity. This finding raises interesting questions as to the role of DAG in cPLA2 activation in WISH cells. The currently accepted paradigm of cPLA2 activation by stimuli considers the involvement of two different signaling branches that converge at the cPLA2 itself (4Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The first one is a phosphorylation cascade that culminates in the phosphorylation of the cPLA2 and serves to increase the intrinsic activity of the enzyme. Both the nature of the kinase involved as well as the site of phosphorylation remain controversial (4Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The second branch for cPLA2 signaling involves the translocation of the enzyme from the cytosol to the membrane, where its substrate is localized. This translocation, which does not modulate the cPLA2activity itself, is currently believed to be mediated by increased Ca2+ availability although other factors may also be involved, especially in the case of stimuli like PMA which do not promote Ca2+ increases (34Fernández B. Balboa M.A. Solı́s-Herruzo J.A. Balsinde J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26711-26716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mosior M. Six D.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2184-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The two pathways for cPLA2 activation are independent of each other, but both appear to be required for proper cPLA2 activation and subsequent AA release (4Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Because PAP is not involved in regulating the cPLA2phosphorylation cascade, it appears logical to suggest that PAP is involved in regulating binding of the cPLA2 to the membrane. DAG is long known to cause perturbations in membrane bilayers, rendering them susceptible to PLA2 attack (36Dawson R.M.C. Irvine R.F. Bray J. Quinn P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 836-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). DAG accumulation in membranes has the effect of spreading apart the phospholipid headgroups, thereby making the glycerol backbone more accessible to the PLA2. Indeed, one of the most commonly utilized methods for detecting cPLA2 activity is based on this principle (20Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J. Putnam J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5268-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, at the same time the specific activity of the cPLA2 is increased as a result of its enhanced phosphorylation, local accumulations of DAG in the membrane allow for an appropriate substrate presentation for the enzyme. When the cPLA2 translocates to the membrane as a a result of increased Ca2+ availability and/or other factors, the enzyme will find optimal conditions to initiate AA release. The key role for DAG in this process is strengthened by the observation that, in the presence of BEL or propranolol, both p42/p44MAPK and cPLA2 become phosphorylated normally in WISH cells but no AA release is induced. DAG is regarded as a universal activator of PKCs. However it is highly unlikely that the PAP-derived DAG is playing such a role in PMA-induced AA release in WISH cells because, in this system, the only PKC that becomes activated is the α isoform, which is the one that PMA directly activates. PMA-induced PKCα is most likely the upstream event that triggers DAG production by activating the PLD, which in turn generates the PA substrate for the PAP. Therefore, despite the presence in WISH cells of the DAG-activable isoforms δ and ε, none of them become activated after DAG levels increase. This is consistent with our suggestion that the PAP-derived DAG serves a structural, not messenger, role for AA release in PMA-activated WISH cells. In agreement with this view is the recent work by Pettitt et al. (37Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Horton T. Liossis C. Lord J.M. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) in activated endothelial cells. These investigators provided compelling evidence that only the DAG which derives from inositol lipids, i.e.the one that PMA mimics in our WISH cell system, is able to activate PKC; whereas, the DAG arising from the PLD/PAP pathway does not serve a messenger role but rather a structural/metabolic role (37Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Horton T. Liossis C. Lord J.M. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). An interesting but yet unresolved question regarding AA metabolism by amnionic WISH cells relates to the fact that apreciable free AA mobilization is already detectable after a 30-min cell challenge, whereas PGE2 is released only after 4–6 h of stimulation with the phorbol ester (13Hulkower K.I. Otis E.R. Li J. Ennis B.W. Cugier D.J. Bell R.L. Carter G.W. Glaser K.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 1065-1074PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that COX-2 is the enzyme responsible for PG production and that its synthesis by PMA-activated WISH cells requires at least 4 h (13Hulkower K.I. Otis E.R. Li J. Ennis B.W. Cugier D.J. Bell R.L. Carter G.W. Glaser K.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 1065-1074PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the question arises as to why free AA is produced much before it can be metabolized to PGE2. It seems likely that at short times, the free AA may act as a signaler rather than an intermediary metabolite. As a matter of fact, it has been suggested that exogenous AA up-regulates the expression of COX-2 in uterine stromal cells (38Prigent-Tessier A. Pageaux J.-F. Fayard J.-M. Lagarde M. Laugier C. Cohen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The induction is not due to conversion of AA to prostaglandin by COX-1 because it occurs even in the presence of aspirin, a well known inhibitor of COX activity. Studies are currently underway in our laboratory to investigate this intriguing possibility. In conclusion, this study has shown that PAP plays an important role in the regulation of cPLA2, possibly by facilitating interaction of the enzyme with its substrate and not by increasing the specific enzyme activity. Our data suggest the mechanism for AA mobilization in PMA-activated WISH cells depicted in Fig. 11. According to this model, the phorbol ester activates PKCα which, in turn, activates PLD. The PLD gives rise to PA that will be converted to DAG by PAP. The DAG produced by this pathway will act to allow a good substrate presentation for the cPLA2. Parallel to but independent of this sequence of events, PKCα and perhaps PA as well (39Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) act to activate the MAP kinase pathway, which leads to the phosphorylation of cPLA2. When these two signaling routes are turned on, the cPLA2 will start hydrolyzing phospholipids, resulting in the early generation of free AA."

A new approach to this problem is presented, consisting of (1) a convention of unambiguous reaction diagrams, (2) a convenient computer simulation method, and (3) a quasi-evolutionary method of probing the functional capabilities of simplified components of the network. Simulations were carried out for a sequence of hypothetical primordial systems, beginning with the simplest plausibly functional system. The complexity of the system was then increased in small steps, such that functionality was added at each step. The results suggested new functional concepts: (1) Rb-family proteins could store E2F in a manner analogous to the way a condenser stores electric charge, and, upon phosphorylation, release a large wave of active E2F; (2) excessive or premature cyclin-dependent kinase activities could paradoxically impair E2F activity during the G1/S transition period. The results show how network simulations, carried out by means of the methods described, can assist in the design and interpretation of experiments probing the control of the G1/S phase transition."

Sporn M.B. Peptide Growth Factors. 1990; 95: 419-472Google Scholar). They act as growth inhibitors for most epithelial cells and some cancer cells. Two pathways are primarily involved in mediating effects of TGFβ on cell growth and differentiation. One pathway involves blockade of cell cycle transit, while the other involves alteration of the extracellular matrix environment. TGFβs elicit their effects by binding to cell surface receptors. Three major types of receptors have been shown to be present in most TGFβ-responsive cell lines. They are designated as type I (RI), type II (RII), and type III (RIII), respectively. RIII is a 280–330-kDa glycoprotein that has no functional signaling domain but rather serves as a ligand storage protein and presents TGFβ to the signaling receptors (2Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). RI and RII, which are glycoproteins of ∼55 and 85 kDa, respectively, form a heteromeric receptor complex. Both are serine/threonine kinases, and each appears to be indispensable for TGFβ signaling (3Lin H.Y. Wang X-F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 4Franzen P. Ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schultz P. Heldin C-H. Miyazono K.

Science. 1994; 263: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The direct involvement of both RI and RII in conferring TGFβ effects indicates that loss of either of the functional receptors would contribute to loss of autocrine TGFβ activity. Loss of negative autocrine TGFβ activity results in a growth advantage caused by an imbalance in positive and negative regulators, possibly leading to tumor formation and progression (6Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Markowitz S.

Science. 1995; 268: 1336-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has shown a loss of RII is often associated with the failure to respond to autocrine and exogenous TGFβ. We have previously demonstrated that re-expression of this receptor in an RII-deficient breast cancer cell line (late passage MCF-7) leads to restoration of TGFβ sensitivity and reduced malignancy in athymic nude mice (6Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that mutational inactivation of RII occurs frequently in a subset of colon tumors with microsatellite instability (7Markowitz S. Wang J. Myeroff L. Parsons R. Sun L-Z. Lutterbaugh J. Fan R.S. Zborowska E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Brattain M. Willson J.K.V. Science. 1995; 268: 1336-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar), and reconstitution of RII expression by stable transfection also leads to reversal of malignancy in these cells (8Wang J. Sun L. Myerloff L. Wang X. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E. Markowitz S. Willson J.K.V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol.

Others have noted that loss of RII expression is important in other types of malignancies (9Garrigue-Antar L. Muñoz-Antonia T. Antonia S.J. Gesmonde J. Vellucci V.F. Reiss M.

A. 1993; 90: 5359-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence suggest that RII is a critical determinant for conferring TGFβ tumor suppression as well as negative autocrine TGFβ growth function. Consequently, agents that can induce RII expression would be valuable in the development of approaches for cancer treatment and prevention where receptor expression appears to be repressed, such as estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer (16Brattain M.G. Ko Y. Banerji S.S. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1996; 1: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Kalkhoven E. Roelen B.A. de Winter J.P. Mummery C.L. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1151-1161PubMed Google Scholar). To date, no such agents have been carefully characterized for their ability to induce RII. Although Cohen et al. (55Cohen P.S. Letterio J.J. Gaetano C. Chan J. Matsumoto K. Sporn M.B. Thiele C.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2380-2386PubMed Google Scholar) showed increased RII mRNA in a human neuroblastoma cell line after retinoic acid (RA) treatment, they were not able to detect cell surface RII. In addition, they failed to test for increased autocrine activity and increased responsiveness/growth inhibition to TGFβ after RA treatment. A study by Turley et al. (56Turley J.M. Funakoshi S. Ruscetti F.W. Kasper J. Murphy W.J. Longo D.L. Birchenall-Roberts M.C. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 655-663PubMed Google Scholar) in RL human B lymphoma cells demonstrated increased RII protein levels following treatment with RA and vitamin E succinate. However, they did not investigate whether this correlated with increased levels of cell surface RII. Development of effective therapeutic and preventive approaches for breast cancer remains an issue, since conventional treatment by antiestrogens such as tamoxifen often leads to resistance in estrogen receptor-positive tumors (18Jordan V.C. Robinson S.P. Welshons W.V. Kessel D. Resistance to Antineoplastic Drugs. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 403-427Google Scholar), and chemotherapy of estrogen receptor-negative tumors is even less effective (19Pasqualini J.R. Sumida C. Giambiagi N. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 31: 613-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since there is a high incidence of vitamin D receptors (VDRs) in human breast cancer tumors (21Eisman J.A. Suva L.J. Sher E. Pearce P.J. Funder J.W. Martin T.J. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 5121-5124PubMed Google Scholar, 22Berger U. Wilson P. McClelland R.A. Colston K. Haussler M.R. Pike J.W. Coombes R.C. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 6793-6799PubMed Google Scholar), vitamin D3 is an appealing candidate as a new therapeutic agent. Like other steroid hormones, it mediates its effect through interaction of its nuclear receptor (VDR) with DNA-responsive elements in the target genes (20Haussler M.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Komm B.S. Terpening C.M. Yamaoka K. Allegretto E.A. Baker A.R. Shine J. McDonnell D.P. Hughes M. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. Pike J.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1988; 44: 263-305PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, many breast cancer cell lines are responsive to vitamin D3antiproliferative effects both in vitro and in athymic mice (23Abe-Hashimoto J. Kikuchi T. Matsumoto T. Nishii Y. Ogata E. Ikeda K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2534-2537PubMed Google Scholar). However, a major drawback for its clinical application is that the doses effective for suppressing tumor growth often cause hypercalcemia. Consequently, analogues have been developed to reduce the calcemic effects while increasing the potency of inhibition of proliferation (23Abe-Hashimoto J. Kikuchi T. Matsumoto T. Nishii Y. Ogata E. Ikeda K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2534-2537PubMed Google Scholar, 24Colston K.W. Mackay A.G. James S.Y. Binderup L. Chander S. Coombes R.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Two analogues, EB1089 and MC903, both of which are derived by modification of the C17 side chain of vitamin D3, have been shown to be effective against rat breast tumors in vivo (24Colston K.W. Mackay A.G. James S.Y. Binderup L. Chander S. Coombes R.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) or as an antiproliferative agent when given topically for psoriasis as well as for cutaneous metastatic breast cancer (25Colston K.W. Chander S.K. Mackay A.G. Coombes R.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of vitamin D3-mediated growth inhibition and in particular its anti-tumor action remain largely unresolved. In this report, we show a correlation between RII expression and vitamin D3 inhibition in MCF-7 sublines that differ dramatically in their RII expression and hence their TGFβ sensitivity as well. We hypothesized that vitamin D3's mechanism of inhibition might involve induction of TGFβ autocrine activity through increased expression of RII. This hypothesis was confirmed by RNase protection assays showing approximately 3-fold induction of the RII mRNA and a 3–4-fold induction of cell surface RII protein. The increased inhibition by vitamin D3/analogues was blocked by TGFβ-neutralizing antibodies, indicating an induction of negative autocrine TGFβ activity. The use of an essential dietary nutrient with antiproliferative and anti-tumor properties represents an attractive approach for chemoprevention and/or therapy. This is particularly true of vitamin D compounds, since the high stress western style diet associated with colon and breast cancer is also associated with low levels of vitamin D and calcium (26Khan N. Yang K. Newmark H. Wong G. Telang N. Rivlin R. Lipkin M. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2645-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, increased autocrine negative TGFβ activity mediated by vitamin D3 compounds in MCF-7 E cells may provide a novel mechanism for blocking malignant progression by chemopreventive approaches. MCF-7 E cells (passage number 150) were kindly provided by Drs. Robert J. Pauley and Herbert D. Soule from the Michigan Cancer Foundation. MCF-7 L cells were obtained from the ATCC and used at a passage number greater than 500. These cell lines were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, pyruvate, vitamins, amino acids, and antibiotics. Working cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. 1,25-(OH)2vitamin D3 as well as its analogues EB1089 and MC903 were generous gifts from Dr. Lise Binderup of LEO Pharmaceutical Products (Ballerup, Denmark). Stock solutions were prepared in isopropyl alcohol at 4 mm. Serial dilutions were made in absolute ethanol and stored at −20 °C protected from light. These diluted solutions were added to the experimental culture media at a final ethanol concentration of 0.1%. Control cells received 0.1% ethanol vehicle, which had no effect on cell proliferation. [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was measured as described previously to determine TGFβ and vitamin D3 sensitivity (6Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF-7 cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/well in 1 ml of medium. Various concentrations of compounds (1,25-(OH)2 D3, EB1089, MC903, or TGFβ) were added after cell attachment (approximately 2 h). Following 4 days of incubation, cells received a 2-h pulse with [3H]thymidine (7 μCi, 46 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA was then precipitated with 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, and the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting in a Beckman LS 7500 scintillation counter as described previously (6Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether there is an increase in the inhibitory effects by TGFβ1 following EB1089 treatment, MCF-7 E cells, which are TGFβ-responsive, were plated as described above. Various concentrations of EB1089 plus 0.1 ng/ml of TGFβ1 were added after attachment. Cells were incubated and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined as described above. Cells were resuspended at a concentration of 1.5 × 104 cells/ml and plated into 24-well tissue culture plates (1 ml/well) either untreated or in the presence of 10 μg/ml TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody (R & D Systems) or control normal IgG. After 3 h of incubation, different concentrations of vitamin D3 compounds were added as indicated. Cells were allowed to grow for 72 h without changing the media, followed by determination of [3H]thymidine incorporation as described above. RNase protection assays were performed to determine RII RNA expression levels after vitamin D3treatment. A 476-base pair fragment of the RII cDNA within the cytoplasmic region was obtained by polymerase chain reaction with the following primers: 5′-TGGACCCTACTCTGTCTGTG-3′ and 5′-TGTTTAGGGAGCCGTCTTCA-3′. The fragment was subcloned into a pBSK (−) plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla) for making the RII riboprobes. In vitro transcription using T3 RNA polymerase yields antisense riboprobes that protect a 476-base pair RII fragment. RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (27Wu S.P. Sun L-Z. Willson J.K.V. Humphrey L . E. Kerbel R. Brattain M.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 115-123PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, exponentially growing cells were treated with EB1089 at 1 × 10−8m for the indicated time periods. Cells were solubilized in guanidine thiocyanate, and total RNA was obtained by cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation (28Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). 40 μg of total RNA was used for overnight hybridization with 32P-labeled antisense riboprobes. Following RNase A and T1 treatment, the protected double-stranded RNA fragments were heat-denatured at 95 °C and analyzed by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the radioactive probes were visualized by autoradiography. Actin was used as an internal control for normalizing the amount of sample loading. Simian recombinant TGFβ1 was purified as described (29Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and iodinated by the chloramine T method (30Ruff E. Rizzino A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were seeded into 35-mm2 tissue culture wells at a density of 105cells/well. In the kinetic studies, exponentially growing cells were treated with various concentrations of the compounds for 24 h or with a single concentration for the indicated time periods. Cell monolayers were then incubated with 200 pm125I-labeled TGFβ1 at 4 °C for 4 h followed by chemical cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate for 15 min (31Segarini P.R. Roberts A.B. Rosen D.M. Seyedin S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14655-14662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled cell monolayers were solubilized in 200 μl of 1% Triton X-100 with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Equal amounts of cell lysate protein were separated by 4–10% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and exposed for autoradiography. MCF-7 E cells were plated into 100-mm2 tissue culture dishes and allowed to reach 70–80% confluency. The medium was then removed and replaced with 5 ml of fresh McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with pyruvate, vitamins, amino acids, and antibiotics (SM). The cells were then treated with EB1089 (1 × 10−8m) or with vehicle only for 24 h. Following treatment, the conditioned medium was collected, and the indicated volumes were used to treat mink lung epithelial cells plated in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1500 cells/well. In addition, a standard TGFβ growth inhibition curve was generated by treating the cells with various concentrations of TGFβ1. The mink lung epithelial cells were allowed to incubate for 3 days at which time the medium was removed and replaced by 100 μl of fresh SM. Colonies were immediately visualized by staining with 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) for 2 h. The stained cells were solubilized with Me2SO (dimethyl sulfoxide) (Mallinckrodt) and the relative cell numbers were then determined by the resultant absorbance at 595 nm. The TGFβ-responsive cyclin A promoter in tandem with a luciferase reporter construct (−133/−2) was used as described previously (32Yoshizumi M. Wang H. Hsieh C-M. Sibinga N.E.S. Perrella M.A. Lee M-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22259-22264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The reporter construct (−133/−2) contains only the activating transcription factor site, which has been shown to be the site required to mediate down-regulation of cyclin A promoter activity by TGFβ1 in mink lung epithelial cells (32Yoshizumi M. Wang H. Hsieh C-M. Sibinga N.E.S. Perrella M.A. Lee M-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22259-22264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). MCF-7 E cells were transiently transfected with 30 μg of luciferase reporter construct and 7 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid by electroporation with a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 250 mV and 960 microfarads. Cells were plated into a six-well tissue culture plate and treated with TGFβ-neutralizing antibody (10 μg/ml) or control normal IgG and allowed to attach for 3 h. Following attachment, cells were treated with EB1089 (1 × 10−8m), while control cells were treated with vehicle only. At 51 h post-transfection, cells were harvested with 100 μl of lysis buffer (Luciferase assay system, Promega). Luciferase activity was determined according to the manufacturer's instruction using a luminometer (Berthold Lumat LB 0501) and expressed as relative units after normalization to β-galactosidase. Inconsistent response of MCF-7 cells to TGFβ has been observed in several laboratories (34Zugmaier G. Ennis B.W. Deschauer B. Katz D. Knabbe C. Wilding G. Daly P. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 141: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,35Jeng M.H. Dijke P.T. Iwata K.K. Jordan V.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 97: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), probably due to growth selection during long term passage of cultures. Having obtained both early (150) and late (>500) passage MCF-7 cells, we decided to first test whether they responded differently to TGFβ (Fig. 1). MCF-7 E cells showed a significant dose-dependent inhibition by TGFβ with an IC50 of 0.2 ng/ml. In contrast, MCF-7 L cells demonstrated complete resistance to TGFβ up to 25 ng/ml (Fig. 1). As described below, MCF-7 E cells expressed RII mRNA and protein in contrast to MCF-7 L cells, which had 5-fold less mRNA and no detectable cell surface protein. Effects of 1,25-(OH)2 D3 and its analogues on cell proliferation of MCF-7 cells were investigated by assessing [3H]thymidine incorporation following treatment by these compounds as described under “Materials and Methods.” MCF-7 E cells showed a dose-dependent inhibition by vitamin D3 with an IC50 of 5 × 10−8m. In contrast, MCF-7 L cells were not affected by vitamin D3 (Fig. 2 A). Vitamin D3 analogues EB1089 and MC903 demonstrate similar growth-inhibitory patterns (Fig. 2, B and C). The overall potency of growth inhibition by EB1089 was approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than vitamin D3. MCF-7 E cells showed an IC50 of 2.5 × 10−10m, and MCF-7 L cells did not respond to EB1089 treatment up to 1 × 10−7m. The correlation between TGFβ and vitamin D3 sensitivity suggested that vitamin D3 may function through increasing TGFβ autocrine-negative activity in MCF-7 E cells. To test this hypothesis, TGFβ-neutralizing antibodies were used to determine whether they were capable of blocking the growth inhibition induced by these compounds (Fig. 3). At 10 μg/ml, TGFβ1-neutralizing antibody reversed the inhibitory effect of vitamin D3 and its analogues, generating an approximately 60% increase in DNA synthesis as compared with the normal chicken IgG treatment. In contrast, MCF-7 L cells did not respond to TGFβ1-neutralizing antibody, indicating a lack of induction of autocrine TGFβ activity. These results indicate that the growth-inhibitory mechanism of vitamin D3 involves induction of TGFβ autocrine-negative activity in MCF-7 E cells. Increased autocrine TGFβ activity could result from enhanced expression of TGFβ isoforms and/or their receptors. To test these possibilities, RNase protection assays were initially carried out on MCF-7 E cells to determine whether there were alterations of TGFβ isoform expression upon treatment with vitamin D3 compounds. MCF-7 E cells expressed high levels of TGFβ1 mRNA and low levels of TGFβ2and TGFβ3 mRNA. Treatment with EB1089 did not generate altered mRNA expression for any of the three TGFβ isoforms (data not shown). In addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of the conditioned medium showed no significant increase in the levels of activated TGFβ1 protein (data not shown). Since the levels of activated TGFβ cannot be determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis, a growth inhibition bioassay on mink lung epithelial cells was performed. The condition medium from EB1089-treated and -untreated MCF-7 E cells was added to mink lung epithelial cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” After exposure to either treated or untreated conditioned medium, no significant difference in growth inhibition was observed in the mink lung epithelial cells (Fig. 4). These results indicate that EB1089 treatment did not alter the activation of secreted growth and/or inhibitory peptides from MCF-7 E cells, one of which is likely to be TGFβ1, as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis. Taken together, these results suggest that the enhanced TGFβ autocrine activity by vitamin D3 did not result from modulation of ligand expression or activation. The other possibility for increased autocrine TGFβ activity upon treatment with vitamin D3 compounds was induction of receptor expression; therefore, we determined whether vitamin D3 analogue treatment modulated expression of RII mRNA. EB1089 (10−8m) was utilized to determine the kinetic effects on RII expression. MCF-7 E cells expressed 5-fold higher RII mRNA than MCF-7 L cells. After exposure to EB1089, a 3-fold increase in the RII mRNA levels of MCF-7 E cells was observed. In contrast, no significant modulation was noted for the MCF-7 L cells after exposure to EB1089 (Fig. 5). EB1089 treatment did not effect the levels of RI or RIII mRNA (data not shown). The increase in MCF-7 E RII mRNA expression led us to examine whether this corresponded to an increase in cell surface RII protein. This was tested by receptor cross-linking with 125I-labeled TGFβ (Fig. 6 A). The GEO cell line, which expresses all three types of TGFβ receptors, was used as a positive control (lane 1). The specificity of cross-linking was demonstrated by competing with 100-fold cold TGFβ1 (lane 2). MCF-7 E cells expressed all three types of receptors (lane 3). Treatment of these cells with the indicated concentrations of vitamin D3 or EB1089 resulted in a 3–4-fold induction of RII, while expression levels of RI remained relatively unchanged (Fig. 6 A). Compared with the MCF-7 E cells, no cell surface RII protein was detected in MCF-7 L cells. Treatment with the vitamin D3 compounds did not result in any change in receptor expression of these cells (Fig. 6 B). To determine if the induction of RII protein in MCF-7 E cells was also time-dependent, a kinetic study was performed. Receptor cross-linking assays revealed a time-dependent increase of cell surface RII protein (Fig. 7 A). Induction was detected as early as 8 h with a 3–4-fold increase after 24 h of treatment.Figure 7Kinetics of induction of cell surface TGFβ RII. Exponentially growing MCF-7 E cells were treated with EB1089 (10−8m) for the indicated time periods.A, receptor cross-linking was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” RI, RII, and RIII were visualized by autoradiography. B, the RII bands were quantified densitometrically with an Ambis scanning system and presented as -fold increase compared with the control at 0 h. The autoradiograph is representative of two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To evaluate whether RII induction by treatment with EB1089 enhanced autocrine TGFβ sensitivity, TGFβ-dependent promoter activity was analyzed using the TGFβ-responsive cyclin A luciferase reporter construct (32Yoshizumi M.

TGFβ induces down-regulation of cyclin A promoter activity but requires a functional TGFβ type I and II receptor complex (32Yoshizumi M. Wang H. Hsieh C-M. Sibinga N.E.S. Perrella M.A. Lee M-E. J.

Thus, an increase in functional receptor levels would result in enhanced down-regulation of cyclin A promoter activity. The cyclin A reporter construct (−133/−2) contains only the activating transcription factor site, which has been shown to mediate down-regulation of cyclin A promoter activity by TGFβ1 in mink lung epithelial cells (32Yoshizumi M.

https://openalex.org/W2326298037,"Cyclin A is a positive regulatory component of kinases required for the progression through S phase and for the transition between the G2 and M phases of the cell division cycle. Previous studies have demonstrated that the promoter of its gene is under transcriptional repression in quiescent cells. Whereas the DNA sequences mediating this effect have been clearly delineated, the nature of the proteins acting in trans is still debated. Indirect observations suggest the involvement of proteins related to the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb). However, the precise role of these proteins has been difficult to assess, since most experiments designed to analyse their function have been carried out in transformed cell lines. Nevertheless, a current model has emerged whereby the role of the p130 protein would be restricted to resting and early G1 cells and p107, absent in quiescent cells, would be involved later in the control of the G1/S transition, whilst pRb would be effective throughout the cell cycle. We show here that cyclin A transcriptional inhibition is relieved in primary fibroblasts from pRb(-/-) embryos and not in fibroblasts from p13O(-/-), p107(-/-) or even p130(-/-)/p107(-/-) double mutant embryos. This suggests a unique role for pRb in controlling the extinction of specific genes in G0, providing thus the first example of non-overlapping functions achieved by the different pocket proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1973675837,"The t(11;22)(p13;q12) translocation associated with desmosplastic small round cell tumor results in a chimeric molecule fusing the amino terminal domain (NTD) of the EWS1 gene to three of the four carboxy-terminal zinc fingers of the WT1 tumor suppressor gene. Since the DNA binding domains of WT1 and EWS/WT1 are structurally different, we have assessed the functional consequences of the EWS/WT1 fusion. We find that the EWS/WT1 protein has a higher binding affinity for a given recognition target than the WT1 product. This is unlike other fusion products involving translocation of the NTD of EWS to DNA binding domains in which DNA binding specificity and affinity is not changed. We demonstrate that EWS/WT1 is a nuclear protein and that the NTD of EWS contains (a) nuclear localization signal(s). We also find that the integrity of a domain within the WT1 zinc fingers, responsible for mediating interaction between WT1 and the transcriptional repressor par-4, is disrupted in the EWS/WT1 fusion product. Deletion analysis of the NTD of EWS indicated that integrity of the entire domain was necessary to achieve full transactivation potential."

To identify cis- and trans-acting factors that regulate Id4 gene expression, we have analyzed the promoter regulatory sequences of the human Id4 gene in transient transfections and gel mobility shift assays. We have identified two functional elements, both located downstream from the TATA motif, that control Id4 promoter activity. One element contains a consensus E-box, and we demonstrated that the protein complex binding to the E-box contains the bHLH-zip upstream stimulatory factor (USF) transcription factor. Enforced expression of USF1 leads to E-box-mediated stimulation of promoter activity. The E-box also mediated stimulatory effects of several bHLH transcription factors, and co-expression of Id4 blocked the stimulatory effect mediated by the bHLH factors. A second element is a GA motif, located downstream from the transcriptional start sites, mutation of which resulted in a 20-fold increase in transcriptional activity. Gel-shift analysis and transfections into DrosophilaSchneider SL2 cells showed that the repressor element is recognized by both Sp1 and Sp3 factors.

Another class of HLH proteins is defined by the Id genes, which share a highly homologous HLH domain but which lack the basic DNA-binding region.

It has been shown that the Id proteins, by heterodimerization with bHLH proteins, inhibit their binding to DNA (13Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar, 15Christy B.A. Sanders L.K. Lau L.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, the Id proteins act as dominant negative regulators by sequestering the ubiquitously expressed class A proteins and preventing them from forming active heterodimers with the tissue-restricted bHLH proteins. Accordingly, it has been found that the down-regulation of Id is necessary for differentiation to proceed in many cell lineages (13Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H.

Several lines of evidences also suggest that at least some Id proteins may play a role in controlling proper G0 to S phase transition in cultured mammalian cell lines (19Hara E. Yamaguchi T.

Moreover, the expression pattern of dnHLH genes during mouse embryogenesis is temporally and spatially controlled (35Riechmann V. Sablitzky F. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 837-843PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms that control Id expression will be important in understanding the molecular events that lead to differentiation. Regions of the Id1 and Id2 promoters controlling the expression of the genes and their response to differentiation or cell cycle withdrawal have been recently identified (36Kurabayashi M. Dutta S. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31162-31170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Tournay O. Benezra R. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the expression and regulation of the Id4 gene. We have chosen to examine the Id4 promoter as a means of identifying elements that may be important for proper transcriptional regulation. Using deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis in transient transfection experiments, we have identified in the proximal Id4 promoter two cis-acting regulatory elements. One element is an E-box, and gel shift experiments in the presence of specific antibodies demonstrated that the protein complex binding to the E-box contains the ubiquitously expressed USF transcription factor. Co-transfection experiments demonstrated that the E-box mediates stimulatory effects exerted by USF1. Moreover, the Id4 promoter E-box also represents an effective target site accessible for transcriptional activation mediated by several transcription factors of the bHLH family such as E2A and Myo-D. Co-expression of Id4 blocks the stimulatory effect mediated by the bHLH transcription factors, suggesting the presence of feedback loops in Id4 transcriptional regulation. Conversely, USF1-mediated stimulation was not inhibited by Id4 co-expression. A second element is a GA motif located downstream from the transcriptional start sites. Mutation of this element resulted in a near 20-fold increase in transcriptional activity. Gel-shift analysis and transfections into Drosophila Schneider cells showed that this repressor element is recognized by both Sp1 and Sp3 factors. These data suggest that Id4 transcriptional control is highly complex and highlight a novel inhibitory function exerted by Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors. The 1.2-kbBamHI-NotI genomic fragment encompassing the 5′ end of the Id4 cDNA was subcloned in the BamHI and NotI sites of pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). Subclones were generated using convenient restriction endonucleases and sequenced with the dideoxy sequencing method using the T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Luciferase reporter constructs were obtained via cohesive or blunt-end ligation of the pBluescript subclone inserts in pGL2 basic (Promega); details of the construction procedure are available upon request. The pGL-Id#6 and pGL-Id-Id#7 were constructed by cloning into the SmaI-HindIII sites of pGL2 a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing sequences from residues −42 to +32 or −25 to +32, respectively. Similarly, pGL-Id#6 E−, pGL-Id#6 Sp− and pGL-Id#8 reporters were constructed using mutated oligonucleotides. The pCMV-Id4 was constructed by cloning an ApaI-NotI fragment corresponding to residues 241–808 of the previously published cDNA sequence encoding a full-length Id4 protein (20Pagliuca A. Cannada-Bartoli P. Saccone S. Della-Valle G. Lania L. Genomics. 1995; 27: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) into the expression vector pRC-CMV (Invitrogen). The pCMV-USF1 expression plasmid has been described previously (40Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and was provided by Dr. R. Roeder (Rockefeller University, New York). The structure of the pCMV/USF-VP16 has been reported (41Choi J.K. Shen C.-P. Radomska H.S. Eckhardt L.A. Kadesch T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5014-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as the expression vectors pCMV/E12, pCMV/E47, and pCMV/E2–2, all of which were provided by Dr. T. Kadesch (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia). Primer extension was performed as described previously (42Lanfrancone L. Pengue G. Pandolfi P.-P. Salcini A.-E. Giacomuzzi A. Longo L. Donti E. De Luca P. La Mantia G. Pelicci P.-G. Lania L. Genomics. 1992; 12: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In brief, a 31-nucleotide oligomer (5′-TAGCCCACCCGGGTGTCCTAGTCACTCCTTC-3′) corresponding to residues 30–61 of the published Id4 cDNA sequence was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and used as a primer. The labeled primer was annealed with different amounts of total mRNA from HeLa cells and processed as described (42Lanfrancone L. Pengue G. Pandolfi P.-P. Salcini A.-E. Giacomuzzi A. Longo L. Donti E. De Luca P. La Mantia G. Pelicci P.-G. Lania L. Genomics. 1992; 12: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The primer extension products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gel. The length of the fragments obtained were estimated by comparison with sequence reactions loaded on the same gel. HeLa, C33A, and NIH3T3 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Subconfluent cell cultures were transfected by the calcium phosphate method using different amounts of reporter and effector plasmids as described in the text, while maintaining at a constant level the quantity of DNA transfected by the addition of genomic carrier DNA. All transfections included a reference sample with pGL2 basic. Cells were harvested 48 h after addition of the precipitates, and extracts were assayed for luciferase activity. For normalization of transfection efficiencies, 400 ng of renilla (sea pansy) luciferase expression plasmid was included in the transfections (pRL-CMV, Promega). Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The experimental reporter luciferase activity was calculated by subtracting the intrinsic activity as measured by samples corresponding to the pGL2 basic and then normalized to transfection efficiency as measured by the activity deriving from pRL-CMV. Drosophila Schneider cells were grown at 25 °C in Schneider medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and transfected by the calcium phosphate method. The pPac-Sp1 and pPacSp3 expression vectors have been described previously (43Majello B. De Luca P. Suske G. Lania L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar, 44Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). 48 h after addition of the precipitates, the cells were harvested and extracts assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to published procedure (45Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar) using subconfluent HeLa cell cultures. The double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to residues −48 to +32 of the Id4 promoter was labeled by filling the terminal 3′ end with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I in the presence of α32P-dCTP. Nuclear extracts were preincubated in a 20-μl mix containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 25 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 2 mm magnesium spermidine, 25 ng/μl poly(dI-dC) for 5 min on ice with a 50-fold molar excess of the unlabeled competitor specified in the text. The probe (1 μl of 10,000 cpm/μl) was then added and the incubation continued for 20 min at 20 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of gel loading buffer, and the mixture was immediately resolved on a 5% acrylamide-bisacrylamide (29:1) 0.5×TBE nondenaturing gel at 15 V/cm. The run was stopped when the bromphenol blue reached the lower margin of the gel. In supershift experiments, the double-stranded oligonucleotides described in the figures were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Antisera against E2A (gift of Dr. Tomas Look, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN), Myc and Max (Santa Cruz), USF (gift of Dr. Piaggio, Laboratorio di Oncogenesi Moleculare CRS-IRE, Rome, Italy), or Sp1 and Sp3 proteins (44Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) were preincubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min on ice before addition of the probe, and the incubation was prolonged as described above. To investigate the transcriptional control of Id4 expression, we isolated a human sequence containing the 5′ end of the Id4 gene. A human genomic phage library was screened with an Id4 cDNA probe, and one phage clone containing a 17-kb insert was isolated and further characterized. The sequence of relevant portions of this region confirmed the presence of the Id4 gene and demonstrated the presence of two introns, the first located shortly after the HLH encoding region, and the second in the 3′-untranslated region of the cDNA (data not shown). A 1.2-kb genomic fragment, which contained sequences upstream of the previously reported 5′ end of the Id4 cDNA (20Pagliuca A. Cannada-Bartoli P. Saccone S. Della-Valle G. Lania L. Genomics. 1995; 27: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), was subcloned and sequenced (Fig. 1). The Id4 transcription initiation site was determined by primer extension (Fig. 1). Three closely spaced transcriptional start sites were identified 26 base pairs downstream of the TATA-box in a region 70 base pairs to the 5′ end of the published cDNA sequences (Fig. 1). Thus, the cloned 1.2-kb genomic fragment contains mainly the Id4 promoter sequence. To identify functional elements contained within the Id4 promoter, the 1.2-kb fragment (Fig. 1) was cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL2 (Promega), and a series of 5′ and 3′ deletion constructs was generated (Fig. 2). These deletion constructs were transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and luciferase activity was determined. Fig. 2 shows that deletions up to position −48 did not result in significant changes in the promoter strength, with an activity of the longest Id4 promoter-reporter being only 2 times higher when compared with the pGL-Id#6 construct (−48/+32), and the promoter activity was completely lost using the pGL-Id#7 containing sequences from −25 to +32. These results indicated that the minimal promoter comprises a relatively small region spanning from −48 to +32, and a potential positive regulatory element appear to be located in the sequences from −1096 to −700.Figure 2Schematic diagram of the deletion mutants of the human Id4 promoter and effect of subclones on the promoter activity. The number indicates the last or the first nucleotide position upstream of the major transcription start site of the Id4 gene. Each pGL-Id construct was transfected into HeLa cells as described in the text. The promoter activity expressed from each subclone relative to the 1.2-kb fragment activity (6.6 × 103 relative light units) is shown on the right panel. B, BamHI; H,HindIII; E, EcoRI; Bs,BssHII; S, SmaI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The sequence of the Id4 gene proximal promoter contains a TATA-box, an E-box (−23/−18) and two putative Sp1 binding sites at −14 and + 13, designated SpUp and SpDn, respectively (Fig. 3). To identify transcription factors able to bind to these elements, an end-labeled fragment covering residues from −48 to +32 of the Id4 minimal promoter was incubated with nuclear extracts from HeLa cells, and then subjected to gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 3, the interaction of Id4 promoter fragment with cell nuclear extracts resulted in three specific protein-DNA complexes (lane 2). Specificity of binding was shown by a competition assay (lane 1). Because the Id4 promoter fragment appears to contain an E-box and two Sp-binding sites, we also used as a competitor specific oligonucleotides spanning these three potential sites, respectively. Using the E-box oligonucleotide as competitor (lane 3), complex II was eliminated, while complex I was unaffected and complex III was partially competed. Thus, it appears that complex II is formed by a protein-DNA complex located on the E-box. Moreover, the partial competition of complex III might be due to the presence of a GC-box within the E-box competitor oligonucleotide, which may bind some Sp-like factor(s) in the presence of E-box but not when it is absent (see competition in lane 5). Inclusion in the binding reaction of a 50-fold excess of a cold oligonucleotide spanning the SpDn site eliminated complexes I and III, suggesting that at least two specific complexes were formed at the GA-box located downstream from the transcriptional start site. Finally, no effect was observed using the SpUp oligonucleotide. Taken together, these results suggest that complexes I and III are sequence-specific complexes formed at the Sp site located downstream of the start site, and complex II is a specific protein-DNA complex formed at the E-box site. To identify the protein factors interacting with the E-box and the Sp-site we used oligonucleotides covering the E-box and the SpDn sites in gel mobility shift assays, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4 A, two distinct protein complexes were observed when the SpDn probe was incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts. It has been shown previously that both Sp1 and Sp3 are able to bind GC- and CT-boxes with similar efficiency, and both proteins are present in many mammalian cell lines (43Majello B. De Luca P. Suske G. Lania L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar, 44Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). To determine the presence of specific members of the Sp family in the complexes formed at the SpDn site, EMSA assays were carried out in the presence of specific antisera raised against bacterially expressed Sp1 and Sp3 proteins, respectively (44Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, it appears that the slow complex also contains an Sp1 binding activity, because the inclusion of Sp1 antiserum in the binding reaction resulted in a reduction of this complex, whereas no effects on the fast migrating complex were seen (lane 2). On the other hand, addition of Sp3-specific antisera in the binding reactions resulted in the absence of the fast migrating (compare lanes 1 and 3). If both antisera against Sp1 and Sp3 were present in the binding reactions, all three complexes were no longer detected (lane 4). Thus, in accordance with previous studies (43Majello B. De Luca P. Suske G. Lania L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar,44Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), we found the the slow migrating complex represent a doublet of unresolved Sp1 and Sp3 bands. The EMSA data clearly showed that the GA-box located downstream from the start site is a binding site for both Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors. The E-box located just downstream of the TATA element may represent a putative binding site for several transcription factors, such as the ubiquitously expressed USF transcription factors, members of the Myc/Max family, and bHLH factors. When the E-box containing oligonucleotide was used as a probe (Fig. 4 B) a specific complex was observed, which was inhibited by the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of specific competitor. Nonspecific interaction bands were found, as shown by the asterisks in Fig. 4 B. Albeit they were only partially competed by the presence of a 50-fold specific competitor (lane 6), these nonspecific complexes were not seen with different HeLa nuclear extract preparations, and a similar partial competition (as reported in lane 6) was also observed with a nonspecific oliogonucleotide competitor (data not shown). To help identify the protein(s) present in the complex, we included in the binding reaction antibodies against factors potentially able to bind to this motif. We found that the inclusion of an antibody directed against human USF1 protein, which recognizes all USF family members in the binding reaction, resulted in the absence of the complex (lane 2). Conversely, no effects were found using antibodies raised against human Myc, Max, and E2A, respectively (Fig. 4 B). Together, these data indicate the complex formed at the E-box site located just downstream of the TATA element, contains the USF1 transcription factor or a protein antigenically related to USF. The presence of a specific USF complex formed at the E-box within the minimal promoter region raised the possibility that Id4 gene transcription might be regulated by the ubiquitously expressed USF1 transcription factor. To determine the functional consequences of ectopic expression of USF on Id4 promoter activity, the Id4 reporter pGLId#6 was co-transfected into HeLa cells together with a USF1 expression vector (40Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, we found that enforced expression of USF resulted in a modest (2–3-fold) activation of the Id4 promoter. Because the transactivation domain of USF1 has been reported to be relatively weak (46Cogswell J.P. Godlewski M.M. Bonham M. Bisi J. Babiss L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we used a USF-VP16 construct, which contains the activation domain derived from the strong viral activator VP16 inserted in the N-terminal portion of USF1 (41Choi J.K. Shen C.-P. Radomska H.S. Eckhardt L.A. Kadesch T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5014-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Using the USF-VP16, we observed a clear E-box-dependent activation of Id4 promoter. The USF-VP16-mediated activation required binding to the E-box as the site-specific E-mutation abolished USF-VP16 stimulation (Fig. 5 A). The specificity of USF1-mediated activation was further demonstrated by co-transfection experiments with members of the bHLH-zip Myc family of transcription factors. We found that co-transfections of the Id4 reporter with expression vectors for Myc, Max, and Mad bHLH-zip factors did not affect the Id4 promoter activity (data not shown). The presence of the E-box also raised the possibility that the Id4 promoter might be regulated by members of the bHLH family of DNA-binding transcription factors. It"

Mutations of the p53 gene are found in a number of canine cancers and many contribute to tumour formation. Here we describe isolation and expression of the complete wild type canine p53 cDNA. The encoded full length canine p53 protein displays strong sequence homology with p53 proteins from other higher vertebrates. Canine p53 protein produced in vitro was shown to recognize and bind to p53-specific DNA targets derived from the p21 and GADD45 promoters and to a consensus p53 binding site. We also show that canine p53 associates with oligonucleotides representing damaged DNA sites and undergoes proteolytic cleavage similar to that described for murine and human p53 proteins. Finally, we show that the canine p53 protein is able to transcriptionally activate a p53-dependent reporter gene in vivo. The results suggest that canine p53 is similar both in structure and function to human p53 and that canine cancer may provide a useful clinical model in the search for effective anti-cancer therapies based on p53."

The mST8Sia IV/PST gene was found to comprise over 60 kilobases and to be composed of five exons. Primer extension analysis revealed that transcription started from 333 nucleotides upstream of the translational initiation site. Transfection with nested deletion mutants of the 5′-flanking region fused to the luciferase reporter gene revealed that the promoter activity of the −107/+145 region was correlated with the gene expression of mST8Sia IV/PST in embryonal carcinoma P19 and neuroblastoma F11 cells. This proximal promoter region lacks an apparent TATA box but has putative binding sites for transcription factors Sp1 and NF-Y (CCAAT binding protein) at nucleotide positions −66/−57 and −47/−37, respectively. Individual deletions and mutations of the inverted Sp1 binding site or inverted NF-Y binding site caused significant reduction of the promoter activity, indicating that each binding site was involved in essential transcription control. Mobility shift assaying also revealed that Sp1 and NF-Y in a nuclear extract of P19 cells bind to the promoter region of the mST8Sia IV/PST gene. Deletion of the region from −60 to −40, which contains parts of both the Sp1 and NF-Y binding sites, completely abolished the promoter activity, suggesting that both Sp1 and NF-Y are synergetically involved in transcription regulation of the mST8Sia IV/PST gene in P19 and F11 cells. Although the overall structures of the two polysialic acid synthase genes (ST8Sia II/STX and IV/PST) are very similar, there is no extensive sequence homology between the 5′-flanking regions of the ST8Sia II/STX and IV/PST genes, suggesting that these two genes are expressed under different regulatory systems.

Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In the late embryonic and early postnatal stages, neurons mainly express the highly polysialylated form of N-CAM (2Finne J.

However, in the course of neural development, the content of PSA associated with N-CAM decreases, resulting in an increase in the adhesive ability of the N-CAM itself (3Hoffman S. Sorkin B.C.

We independently cloned a mouse cDNA encoding an α2,8-sialyltransferase, ST8Sia IV, whose amino acid sequence exhibits 99.8% identity to that of hamster PST-1, and showed that ST8Sia IV is a PSA synthase (10Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we demonstrated that ST8Sia II/STX is another PSA synthase (12Kojima N.

In the mouse, the amino acid sequences of the two types of PSA synthases, ST8Sia II/STX and IV/PST, exhibit 56% identity, which is the highest score among the sialyltransferases cloned so far. Northern blot analysis indicated that expression of the mST8Sia II/STX gene was restricted to the brain and testis, whereas the mST8Sia IV/PST gene was expressed strongly in the lung, spleen, and heart, rather than the brain (10Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Expression of the mST8Sia II/STX gene in the brain was strictly regulated during development (12Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Expression of the mST8Sia IV/PST gene was also higher in fetal than adult brain but was less regulated during brain development as compared with that of the mST8Sia II/STX gene (10Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our recent results indicated that mST8Sia II/STX and IV/PST synthesize PSA of different sizes in vitro and in vivo (17Kojima N. Tachida Y. Yoshida Y. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19457-19463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18Kojima N. Tachida Y. Tsuji S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear why two types of PSA synthases exist and how they are differently expressed. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the differential expression of the mST8Sia II/STX and IV/PST genes, it is important to know the structures and activities of their promoters. We recently reported the entire genomic organization and the promoter structure of the mST8Sia II/STX gene (19Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Kanematsu T. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30167-30173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the minimal promoter region of the mST8Sia II/STX gene conferred the cell type-specific expression in the reporter gene. The minimal promoter was embedded in a GC-rich domain (GC content, 74%), in which two Sp1 binding motifs as well as a long purine-rich region were found, but it lacked TATA and CAAT boxes. In the present study, we describe the genomic structure of the mST8Sia IV/PST gene and its promoter sequence involved in the regulation of transcription activity. A mouse genomic cosmid library was constructed and screened as described previously (20Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Kanematsu T. Taguchi A. Arita M. Kojima N. Tsuji S. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The locations of the exons of the mST8Sia IV/PST gene were determined by PCR (GeneAmp XL PCR Kit, Perkin-Elmer) with specific oligonucleotide primers or by hybridizing radiolabeled sialyltransferase cDNA to the same blots. The 3′-untranslated region of the mST8Sia IV/PST cDNA was isolated from a 3-day-old mouse brain cDNA library (20Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Kanematsu T. Taguchi A. Arita M. Kojima N. Tsuji S.

Kurosawa N. Kanematsu T. Taguchi A. Arita M. Kojima N. Tsuji S. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of 5 μg of mouse brain poly(A) RNA using primer O5-EX2, a 32-mer oligonucleotide complementary to mST8Sia IV mRNA (nucleotide positions +325 to +293, Table I). After the cDNA had been A-tailed, two consecutive PCRs were performed with two nested sets of primers. For pair 1, the forward primer wasNotI-(dT)18 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the reverse primer was O5-EX2. For pair 2, the forward primer was as above but without the T-tail, 5′-AACTGGAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCAGGAA-3′, and the reverse primer was O5-N5 (Table I). The cDNA was amplified for 35 cycles of a step program (94 °C, 40 s; 55 °C, 40 s; and 72 °C, 60 s). The amplified products were subcloned into pUC119 and then sequenced. pO5-22E1.5 was constructed by subcloning a 1.5-kb EcoRI fragment from COS O5-22, which contains the 1030-bp 5′-flanking region of the mST8Sia IV/PST gene, into the pUC118 plasmid. The O5-EX2 primer was end-labeled with [32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The radiolabeled O5-EX2 was hybridized with 5 μg of poly(A) RNA prepared from mouse brain or 5 μg of yeast tRNA, as a control to extension specificity, and then extended with Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (19Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Kanematsu T. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30167-30173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The primer extension products were separated on a 6% sequencing gel along with dideoxy-mediated a chain termination sequencing reaction of pO5-22E1.5, using O5-EX2 as the primer. To obtain various lengths of the 5′-flanking region of the mST8Sia IV gene, PCR with Tth DNA polymerase (GeneAmp XL PCR Kit, Perkin-Elmer) was performed using two primers, O5-ATGNco (Table I) and a reverse sequencing primer, with pO5-22E1.5 as the template. The mST8Sia IV/PST-luciferase fusion gene expression plasmids were constructed by subcloning the following restriction fragments from the PCR products into pPicaGene-Basic II (pPGBII, Toyo-ink, Japan): pBO5-BN0.87 carries a 0.87-kbBamHI-NcoI fragment and pBO5-SaN0.16 carries a 0.16-kb SacI-NcoI fragment, respectively. Other series of deletion plasmids were constructed by subcloning the restriction enzyme-digested PCR products amplified using the primer set of O5-ATGNco and the restriction enzyme site introducing mutagenic primers into pPGBII. The primers and template plasmids used were as follows: pBO5-XN0.53 carries a 0.53-kb XhoI-NcoI fragment amplified by using the primer set of O5-530X/O5-ATGNco; pBO5-XN0.44 carries a 0.44-kb XhoI-NcoI fragment amplified by using the primer set of O5-440X/O5-ATGNco; pBO5-NhN0.35 carries a 0.35-kb NheI-NcoI fragment amplified by using the primer set of O5-350Nh/O5-ATGNco; pBO5-XN0.31 carries a 0.31-kb XhoI-NcoI fragment amplified by using the primer set of O5-310X/O5-ATGNco; and pBO5-XH0.25 carries a 0.25-kb XhoI-HindIII fragment amplified by using the primer set of O5-440X/O5-150H, respectively, with pO5-22E1.5 as the template (Table I). For the pBO5-NhN3.5 construct, a 2.8-kbNheI-XhoI fragment from COS O5-22 was subcloned into pBO5-XN0.67 digested with the same restriction enzymes. As controls, plasmids pBSV, containing the luciferase gene driven by the SV40 promoter, and pPGBII, containing the promoterless luciferase gene, were transfected into parallel cultures of each cell line. The luciferase activity due to each luciferase reporter plasmid was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity by cotransfecting an internal control plasmid, pSRβ-gal, carrying a β-galactosidase gene under the control of the SRα promoter. In all the cell lines tested, pPGBII was inactive to the expression of luciferase activity, whereas pBSV caused a high level of expression. NIH3T3, F11, undifferentiated-P19, Neuro2a, F9, B16, LL/2, C2C12, and NMuMG cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells per 60-mm diameter dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum 24 h prior to transfection, respectively. For the neural differentiation of P19 cells into neuronal cells, the cells were seeded into and aggregated in bacteriological grade dishes in the presence of 1 mm retinoic acid at the cell density of 1 × 105/ml. After 3 days, the aggregates were trypsinized, and then approximately 1 × 105cells per 60-mm diameter dish (tissue culture grade dishes) were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum 24 h prior to transfection. The luciferase plasmid (5 μg) used as the reporter and the pSRβ-gal plasmid (0.5 μg) used as an internal control for transfection efficiency were transfected into the cells by means of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h transfection, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with cell lysis buffer (PGβ-50, Toyo-ink, Japan). Luciferase activity was measured using a PicaGene Luciferase Assay System (Toyo-ink) and a Luminescencer AB-2000 (ATTO, Japan). Light activity measurements were performed in quadruplicate, averaged, and then normalized to the β-galactosidase activity to correct for the transfection efficiency. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using a Luminescent β-Galactosidase Detection Kit II (CLONTECH). The primers used for the construction of site-replaced mutants and site-directed deletion mutants of the Sp1, NF-Y, and AP-2 binding sites are shown in Table I. All PCRs were performed using pO5-22E1.5 as the template. The Sp1 binding site-replaced mutant, pBO5-XN0.53(Sp1*), was constructed by subcloning into XhoI-NcoI-digested pPGBII anXhoI-EcoRI fragment amplified with the primer set of O5-530X/Sp*-N and an EcoRI-NcoI fragment with the primer set of Sp*-C/O5-ATGNco. The Sp1 binding site-deleted mutants, pBO5-XN0.53 (Sp1*−75/−56) and pBO5-XN0.53 (Sp1*−60/−40), were constructed as follows. pBO5-XN0.53 (Sp1*−75/−56) was constructed by subcloning into pPGBII anXhoI-EcoRI fragment amplified with the primer set of O5-530X/FSp*-N and an EcoRI-NcoI fragment with the primer set of Sp*−C/O5-ATGNco. pBO5-XN0.53 (Sp1*−60/−40) was constructed by subcloning into pPGBII anXhoI-EcoRI fragment amplified with the primer set of O5-530X/Sp*-N, and an EcoRI-NcoI fragment with the primer set of BSp*-C/O5-ATGNco. A series of NF-Y binding site-deleted mutants, pBO5-XN0.53 (Δ−53/−51), pBO5-XN0.53 (Δ−50/−48), pBO5-XN0.53 (Δ−47/−45), pBO5-XN0.53 (Δ−44/−42), pBO5-XN0.53 (Δ−41/−39), and pBO5-XN0.53 (Δ−39/−37), was constructed by subcloning the NcoI-XhoI-digested PCR products into pPGBII. For the construction of pBO5-XN0.53(Δ−53/−51), PCR (94 °C, 40 s; 50 °C, 40 s; and 72 °C, 90 s) was performed using two fragments amplified with the primer sets of O5-530X/A-N and A-C/O5-ATGNco, respectively, as templates, without primers for the first 5 cycles, followed by amplification in the presence of the primer set of O5-530X/O5-ATGNco for 30 cycles. pBO5-XN0.53(Δ−50/−48), pBO5-XN0.53(Δ−47/−45), pBO5-XN0.53(Δ−44/−42), pBO5-XN0.53(Δ−41/−39), and pBO5-XN0.53(Δ−39/−37) were constructed as above using the corresponding primer sets. The AP-2 binding site-replaced mutant, pBO5-XN0.53 (Ap2*), was constructed by subcloning intoXhoI-NcoI-digested pPGBII anXhoI-BglII fragment amplified with the primer set of O5-530X/Ap*-N and an EcoRI-NcoI fragment with the primer set of Ap*-C/O5-ATGNco. The AP-2 binding site-deleted mutant, pBO5-XN0.53(Δ+42/+87), was constructed by subcloning into pPGBII an XhoI-BglII fragment amplified with the primer set of O5-530X/FAp*-N and a BglII-NcoI fragment with the primer set of Ap*-C/O5-ATGNco. All plasmids were verified by restriction mapping and sequencing. The NF-YA gene was cloned from P19 cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR using primers 5′-GAAGCTTCAGGACTCTTAAC-3′ and 5′-TGACTGATCAGCTCTGCCACC-3′ (22Huijsduijnen R.H. Li X.Y. Black D. Matthes H. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). PCR products were cloned into pBluescriptII SK+ and then sequenced. the NF-YB gene (22Huijsduijnen R.H. Li X.Y. Black D. Matthes H. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) was cloned from an adult mouse brain cDNA library by plaque hybridization and then sequenced. In vitrotranscription of the NF-YA and NF-YB genes was performed using an mCAP mRNA capping kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting mRNA samples (2 μg) were applied to a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Amersham Corp.) for in vitro translation. The DNA fragment from −107 to −16 was prepared from pBO5-XN0.44 by digestion with XhoI and PstI and then end-labeled with [32P]dCTP using Klenow polymerase. Binding assays were performed with a labeled probe (10–20 k cpm) in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia) and 2 μg of a nuclear protein extract or an appropriate volume of the products translated in vitro. Binding reactions were carried out for 30 min at 0 °C in 25 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. Competitor fragments or anti-Sp1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were included where indicated. The DNA fragment from −339 to −221, which was prepared from pBO5-XN0.63 by digestion withXhoI and BlnI, and the DNA fragment from −107 to −16 were used as nonspecific and specific competitors, respectively. The synthetic DNA fragments, 5′-CGCCCCCTCAGCACGGTGATTGGCTGG-3′ (nucleotide positions from −62 to −36) and 5′-AGGCCAGCCAATCACCGTGCTGAGGGGG-3′ (complementary to nucleotide positions from −60 to −33), were used as competitors after the two synthetic DNAs had been annealed. After incubation, the samples were loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 19:1) in 0.5× TBE. The gel was run in the cold at 200 V and dried, and then the radioactivity was detected with a BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Japan). The screening of an NIH3T3 cell cosmid library with mST8Sia IV/PST cDNA resulted in the isolation of three independent genomic clones. A restriction map of the approximately 100-kb region containing the mST8Sia IV/PST gene is shown in Fig. 1. The locations of the mST8Sia IV/PST exons were determined by PCR and Southern blot hybridization using a variety of oligonucleotides designed according to the known mST8Sia IV/PST cDNA sequence. Since cross-hybridization experiments indicated that CosO5-12 and CosO5-19 did not overlap, further screening of 5 × 105 genomic clones (inserts ranging from 30 to 40 kb in size) was performed with a 2-kb fragment of CosO5-12 including exon 4 and a 1.3-kb fragment of the T3 primer end of CosO5-19 as probes. However, no overlapping clones were obtained. Southern blot analyses of the NIH3T3 genomic DNA using the above two probes showed that the distance between the termini of CosO5−12 and −19 was over 12 kb (data not shown). We sequenced the exons to determine their exact sizes and the intron/exon junctions (Table II). The sequences of all the intron/exon splice junctions conformed to the GT-AG rule (23Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). The mST8Sia IV/PST cDNA was divided into 5 exons, ranging from 132 to 5656 bp, with intron sizes of 8–24 kb, and spanning more than 60 kb of genomic DNA (Fig. 1). Exon 1 contained the entire 5′-untranslated region and the beginning of the coding region to amino acid residue 37, containing a cytoplasmic domain, a short hydrophobic signal anchor sequence, and a part of the stem domain. Exons 3–5 encoded the putative active domain of the enzyme, and exon 5 contained a large 3′-untranslated region. We previously reported mST8Sia IV/PST cDNA sequences lacking the whole 3′-untranslated region. Therefore, to determine the 3′ end of the 5-kb mST8Sia IV/PST transcript, the mouse brain cDNA library was screened by PCR using primers distributed along the 3′ part of the gene. Sequence analyses of the PCR products revealed that the size of the transcribed RNA was 6786 bp, thus it included a large 3′-untranslated region of 5372 bp. Poly(A) addition occurred 23 nucleotides downstream of the sequence at the T residue of the polyadenylation signal (AATAAA).Table IIExon/intron junctions of the mST8Sia IV/PST geneExonSplice donorIntronSplice acceptor37391 446 bpCAA CTC ATC GGgtaaatgcatgttc—8 kb-cctatctgtcttttcagA GAT GGTGln Leu IleAsp Gly81832 132 bpCTG GAG ATA AGgtgagtttctttaa—8 kb-ttgcattccaaatacagG AAG AACLeu Glu IleLys Asn1671693 258 bpTTT GTA ATA AGgtgagcatcctgct—24 kb-cattaatttttcctcagG TGC AATPhe Val IleCys Asn2652674 294 bpGCA GTC AGA GGgtaagtggctggaa—<12 kb-gtttttgtttcttctagA TAC TGGAla Val ArgTyr Trp Open table in a new tab The transcription initiation site was determined by primer extension with RNA recovered from 1-day-old mouse brain, in which the mST8Sia IV/PST gene was expressed (Fig. 2). Northern blot analysis indicated that the mST8Sia IV/PST gene gave a single transcript, whose size was about 5 kb. The primer extension products obtained with primer O5-EX2 were analyzed on a 6% sequencing gel. The end points of the extension were determined by comparison with a sequence ladder derived from the same genomic DNA template and the original primer, O5-EX2. The end point was determined to be a guanine (+1), which corresponded to a position 333 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon, ATG. Moreover, we performed 5′-RACE-PCR on newborn mouse brain poly(A) RNA to identify the 5′ end of the mST8Sia IV/PST gene, and the longest RACE-PCR product corresponded to the transcription initiation site determined in the primer extension experiments. Therefore, mST8Sia IV/PST mRNA was transcribed at a single position 333 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon at least in mouse brain and gave a single transcript. Analysis of the sequence immediately upstream of the transcription initiation site revealed that the mST8Sia IV/PST gene promoter consists of a G + C-rich sequence lacking a canonical TATA box (Fig. 3). In this promoter, an apparent G + C-rich region extends from −100 to +150 (GC content, 64%). The G + C-rich region of the mST8Sia IV/PST gene promoter is shorter and its GC content is lower than those of the mST8Sia II/STX gene promoter (nt −175 to +168, 74%) (18Kojima N. Tachida Y. Tsuji S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The TATA-less mST8Sia IV/PST gene promoter contains an inverted Sp1 binding site at positions −66 to −57 (8 of 10 matching), an inverted NF-Y (CCAAT binding protein) binding site at positions −47 to −37 (9 of 11 matching), and an AP-2 binding site, CC(G/C)C(A/G)GGC, at positions +84 to +91 (7 of 8 matching). The 1-kb 5′-flanking sequence of the mST8Sia IV/PST gene does not exhibit extensive homology with the upstream region of the mST8Sia II/STX gene. To characterize the regions regulating the transcription activity of the gene, we constructed a series of chimeric plasmids containing different lengths of the 5′-flanking region of the mST8Sia IV/PST gene fused to the promoterless luciferase gene in pPGBII (Fig. 4). One of the constructs, pBO5-NhN3.5, was assayed for promoter activity by transient transfection into several cell lines at first (Table III). Of these cell lines, embryonal carcinoma P19 cells showed the highest promoter activity, neuroblastoma F11 cells showed a moderate level of promoter activity, and NIH3T3 fibroblast cells showed a very low level of promoter activity. The level of endogenous mST8Sia IV/PST gene expression in P19 cells was similar to that in F11 cells, but NIH3T3 cells do not express the mST8Sia IV/PST gene at all (data not shown). Thus, we decided to use P19, F11, and NIH3T3 cells for the following study for comparison of the promoter activities.Table IIIRelative promoter activities of several types of cellsCell lineDescriptionRelative promoter activity%P19Embryonal carcinoma67.1Neuro2aNeuroblastoma62.3F11Neuroblastoma/DRG42.6F9Embryonal carcinoma35.8B16Melanoma27.1LL/2Lewis lung carcinoma19.3C2C12Muscle myoblast11.4NIH3T3Fibroblast9.9NMuMGNormal mammary gland9.5 Open table in a new tab Sequential deletions of the region between nucleotide positions −3140 and −541 had little effect on the luciferase activity. Further deletions from nucleotide positions −541 to −200 increased the promoter activity in differentiated P19 cells as well as in undifferentiated P19 and F11 cells. Although further deletions from nucleotide positions −200 to −107 (pBO5-XN0.44) had little effect on the activity, deletions from nucleotide positions −200 to −15 (pBO5-NhN0.35) caused a drastic decrease in the promoter activity from one-fourth to one-fifth that of pBO5-XN0.44 in the examined cells.

https://openalex.org/W2033011046,"Grb2 is an adaptor molecule comprising one Src homology (SH) 2 and two SH3 domains. This protein has a natural isoform named Grb3-3 with a deletion within the SH2 domain. Numerous evidence points to a functional connection between SH2- and SH3-containing proteins and molecules implicated in RNA biogenesis. In this context, we have examined the binding of Grb2 and Grb3-3 to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) C. By the use of an in vivo genetic approach and through in vitroexperiments, we furnish evidence that both Grb2 and Grb3-3 interact with hnRNP C proteins. Subcellular fractionation studies clearly show that Grb2 is partially localized in the nucleus. In addition, coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that Grb2·hnRNP C complexes exist in intact hematopoietic cells. The carboxyl-terminal SH3 domains of Grb2 and Grb3-3 are primarily responsible for the association with hnRNP C. However, although the proline-rich motif of hnRNP C is involved in the interaction with Grb2, it is not in the binding to Grb3-3. Furthermore, poly(U) RNA inhibits the association of Grb2 with hnRNP C, whereas it enhances the interaction between Grb3-3 and hnRNP C. These findings suggest that the Grb2/Grb3-3-hnRNP C interactions might fulfill different biological functions. Grb2 is an adaptor molecule comprising one Src homology (SH) 2 and two SH3 domains.

Grb2/Ash is the mammalian homolog of Sem-5 and Drk in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, respectively. Grb2 is a ubiquitous 25-kDa protein composed of one Src homology 1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; AD, activation domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (SH) 2 and two SH3 domains. This adaptor molecule plays an essential role in cell growth and differentiation and, in addition to other functions, connects tyrosine kinase receptors to activation of the Ras pathway. It interacts via its SH3 domains with the proline-rich regions of the mammalian Sos exchange factors. This Grb2·Sos complex exists in the cytosol of quiescent cells and upon growth factor stimulation is recruited in an SH2-dependent manner to the plasma membrane, where Sos stimulates nucleotide exchange on Ras (see Ref. 1Chardin P. Cussac D. Maignan S. Ducruix A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholarfor review). Grb2 has also been shown to interact with the ubiquitous Ras exchange factor C3G (2Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and the hematopoietic guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav (3Romero F. Fischer S. Cell Signal. 1996; 8: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in NRK cells, Grb2 has been shown to be involved in growth factor control of cytoskeletal structure (4Matuoka K. Shibasaki F. Shibata M. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3467-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain of Grb2 can also bind to focal adhesion kinase (5Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar), to the receptor protein phosphatase α (6den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and to the chimeric Bcr/Abl products in human leukemias (7Puil L. Liu J. Gish G. Mbamalu G. Bowtell D. Pelicci P.G. Arlinghaus R. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Finally, several other proteins, such as Abl, Cbl, dynamin, synapsin, or 5-lipoxygenase, can bind to the SH3 domains of Grb2, suggesting that this adaptor molecule may play a role in many cellular activities (1Chardin P. Cussac D. Maignan S. Ducruix A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Several isoforms of Ash/Grb2 have been described. Ash-m and Ash-s are two rat isoforms generated from a single gene by unusual alternative splicing events. Microinjection of Ash-m or Ash-s into Balb/c 3T3 cells inhibited DNA synthesis induced by platelet-derived growth factor (8Watanabe K. Fukuchi T. Hosoya H. Shirasawa T. Matuoka K. Miki H. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13733-13739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Grb3-3 is a human isoform of Grb2 thought to arise by alternative splicing, carrying a deleted non-functional SH2 domain but retaining functional SH3 domains (9Fath I. Schweighoffer F. Rey I. Multon M.C. Boiziau J. Duchesne M. Tocque B. Science. 1994; 264: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The residues deleted in the SH2 domain (residues 60–100 in Grb2) participate in the binding of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. Indeed, Grb3-3 did not bind to phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor and inhibited epidermal growth factor-induced transactivation of a Ras-responsive element. This inhibition was overcome by Grb2, suggesting that depending on the ratio of Grb2/Grb3-3, Grb3-3 might serve as a suppressor of Grb2 functions. Several evidences implicate Grb3-3 in apoptosis (9Fath I. Schweighoffer F. Rey I. Multon M.C. Boiziau J. Duchesne M. Tocque B. Science. 1994; 264: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Rey I. Fath I. Parker F. Haun F. Schweighoffer F. Tocqué B. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 105-111PubMed Google Scholar), but the mechanism remains unknown. In light of the direct interaction of Grb3-3 with hSos1, it could be argued that the apoptotic effect of Grb3-3 might be a consequence of the down-regulation of Ras GTP loading, but this alone might not be sufficient. Thus, Grb3-3 and Grb2 may have common partners besides Sos, and Grb3-3 may compete with Grb2 for vital Ras-independent pathways. In the last several years, an increasing number of SH2- and SH3-containing proteins that interact with molecules implicated in RNA biogenesis have been described (11Fumagalli S. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J.

In this context, we considered it of great interest to analyze the behavior of an exclusively nuclear RNP, hnRNP C, in regard to its ability to interact with an adaptor molecule, Grb2 (and its isoform Grb3-3), involved in transducing signals from receptors. hnRNP C proteins (C1, Mr41,000; C2, Mr 43,000) are among the most abundant pre-mRNA binding proteins. C2 is identical to C1, except for a 13-residue insertion due to a 39-nucleotide insert in the corresponding mRNA, probably derived from a common pre-mRNA by alternative splicing. C proteins are found in the nucleus during interphase, but during mitosis they are dispersed throughout the cell. Antibody inhibition and immunodepletion experiments implicated hnRNP C in pre-mRNA splicing (see Ref. 17Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar for review). Our results demonstrate that (i) Grb2 and Grb3-3 interact with hnRNP C, (ii) both isoforms partially localize in the nucleus, and (iii) while the Grb3.3-hnRNP C association is stimulated by poly(U) RNA, Grb2-hnRNP C interaction is completely inhibited.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2847-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) were maintained in α-medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum and erythropoietin at 2 units/ml. Jurkat and UT7-S Epo cell cytosol and nuclear fractions were prepared essentially as described (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coliBL21 strain was transformed with pGEX-derived plasmids and bacteria incubated with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. GST (glutathioneS-transferase) fusion proteins were recovered and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Nuclear extracts from 107 Jurkat cells (150 μg of protein) were diluted to 150 mm NaCl and supplemented with 1% Nonidet P40, and the supernatant incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with fusion proteins (0.2–3 μg) bound to glutathione-coupled agarose beads. The washed beads were dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), electroblotted, and probed with different antibodies. For the RNA competition experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated with poly(U) RNA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 50 μg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C before adding GST fusion proteins. Nuclear extracts from 3 × 107 Jurkat cells (450 μg of protein) were diluted to 150 mm NaCl and supplemented with 0.05% Brij 96 (polyoxylethylene-10-oleylether); after centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with preimmune serum for 30 min and then with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated for 12–14 h with polyclonal anti-Grb2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies, monoclonal anti-hnRNP C (4F4) antibodies (provided by Dr. G. Dreyfuss, University of Pennsylvania) (27Dreyfuss G. Choi Y.D. Adam S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1104-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) or preimmune serum, and then with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h and centrifuged. The beads were washed, dissolved in SDS-sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Filters were developed with different antibodies. For blocking experiments, the antigenic peptide (residues 195–217) of anti-Grb2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used at 25 μg/ml. Functional connections between SH2- and SH3-containing proteins and molecules implicated in RNA biogenesis have been described. Therefore, it seemed of interest to study the potential interactions of Grb2 and Grb3-3 (Fig. 1 A), adaptor molecules involved in signaling events, with hnRNP C, an exclusively nuclear RNP. We have investigated the binding of these proteins to v90, a hnRNP C subclone isolated in our laboratory from a Jurkat T cell oligo(dT) cDNA library constructed in frame with gal4-AD. This clone spans residues 120/133 to 290/303 of hnRNP C1/C2, respectively (Fig. 1 B). We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to analyze these associations. For this purpose, the full-lengthgrb2 and grb3-3 were cloned in frame withgal4-DB in pGBT10 and then cotransformed with pGAD-v90 in Hf7c cells. If the two hybrid proteins interact, the reporter strain is expected to grow in the absence of histidine and to produce β-galactosidase (28Fields S. Song O.-K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar). Hf7c carrying pGBT10-Grb2 and pGAD-hSos1 (residues 1131–1333) (19Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. Fig. 1(C and D) shows that pGBT10-Grb2/pGAD-v90 and pGBT10-Grb3-3/pGAD-v90 conferred on Hf7c yeast cells the ability to grow in the absence of histidine. Furthermore, full-length Csk, another protein with SH2 and SH3 domains, and lamin, an unrelated protein, did not interact with the v90 polypeptide (data not shown). Therefore, both Grb2 and Grb3-3 specifically bind to hnRNP C proteins in the two-hybrid system. We next sought to identify the specific Grb2 and Grb3-3 sequences implicated in the interaction with hnRNP C proteins. Mutations in the amino-terminal SH3 (N-SH3) or in the carboxyl-terminal SH3 (C-SH3) domains of Grb2 and Grb3-3 greatly decrease the affinity of binding to the proline-rich region of hSos1 (9Fath I.

Shin T.B. Seidel-Dugan C. Brugge J.S. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1992; 258: 1665-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of point mutants in the N-SH3 (P49L) and in the C-SH3 (G203R and G162R, respectively) domains of Grb2 and Grb3-3 (9Fath I. Schweighoffer F. Rey I. Multon M.C. Boiziau J. Duchesne M. Tocque B. Science. 1994; 264: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Schweighoffer F. Bismuth G. Camonis J. Tortolero M. Fischer S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1665-1669PubMed Google Scholar) on the interaction with v90 in the yeast two-hybrid system. In addition, we generated double N- and C-SH3 mutants of Grb2 (P49L-G203R) and Grb3-3 (P49L-G162R) and assessed their ability to associate with hnRNP C proteins. Strain Hf7c was cotransformed with pGAD-v90 and pGBT10 containing the grb2 and grb3-3 mutants in frame with gal4-DB. Visual comparison of growth in the absence of histidine indicates that mutations in either of the SH3 domains of both Grb2 and Grb3-3 decreased the interaction with hnRNP C (Fig. 2, A and B), as reported for Grb2/hSos1 (19Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). However, the P49L mutations were less effective than G203R or G162R, and the double mutations (P49L-G203R or P49L-G162R) completely abolished the interaction. Moreover, we confirmed by Western blot experiments that wild-type and mutant proteins were produced in similar amounts in Hf7c (data not shown). These results indicate that the association of Grb2 and Grb3-3 with hnRNP C proteins is primarily mediated by the C-SH3 domains. SH3 domains are known to bind proteins through rather specific proline-rich sequences (32Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Human hnRNP C proteins have a region rich in prolines (YPARVPPPPPIARAVVPS, residues 126/139 to 143/156 (hnRNP C1/C2, respectively)) (33Burd C.G. Swanson M.S. Gorlach M. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9788-9792Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), which is contained in the v90 subclone. To ascertain whether the binding between Grb2/Grb3-3 and hnRNP C proteins involves the interaction between a SH3 domain and a proline-rich motif, we substituted alanines for the underlined five prolines of v90 to yield v90 (5PA). Strain Hf7c was cotransformed with pGBT10-Grb2 or pGBT10-Grb3-3 and pGAD-v90 (5PA) and the interaction tested in the yeast system. Fig. 2 C shows that Grb2 does not bind to v90 (5PA) whereas the Grb3-3-v90 (5PA) interaction is clearly detected. Therefore, the Grb2-hnRNP C association is a classical SH3-proline-rich interaction, which is not the case for the Grb3-3-hnRNP C interaction. To localize the Grb3-3 binding site in hnRNP C, we subcloned several v90 fragments in pGAD1318 (Fig. 3 A). We tested these constructions with pGBT10-Grb3-3 in the two-hybrid system, and only v90.3 continued to interact with Grb3-3 (Fig. 3 B). This limits the interacting region to residues 120–209 of hnRNP C1, although this portion does not have any known binding motifs. To confirm the results obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system, the interactions of Grb2 and Grb3-3 with hnRNP C proteins were studied byin vitro binding experiments. The cDNAs of grb2, grb3-3, grb2 P49L, grb2 G203R, grb3-3 P49L, and grb3-3 G162Rsubcloned into pGEX-derived plasmids (9Fath I. Schweighoffer F. Rey I. Multon M.C. Boiziau J. Duchesne M. Tocque B. Science. 1994; 264: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Schweighoffer F. Bismuth G. Camonis J. Tortolero M. Fischer S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1665-1669PubMed Google Scholar) were used. The chimeric fusion proteins were purified from bacterial lysates on glutathione-agarose beads (see “Experimental Procedures”). Since C1 and C2 hnRNP proteins are confined to the nucleus, we used nuclear extracts to carry out the binding experiments. Nuclear extracts from a T lymphoma cell line (Jurkat, J77 clone) were incubated with GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads. Protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of hnRNP C was determined by using anti-hnRNP C (4F4) antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4, the chimeric GST-Grb2 and GST-Grb3-3 bind the endogenous human hnRNP C proteins and, although these interactions were usually performed with 3 μg of GST fusion proteins, GST-Grb2 and GST-Grb3-3 at concentrations as low as 0.2 μg were still able to associate with hnRNP C. Moreover, by silver staining and [35S]methionine labeling of nuclear proteins from Jurkat and UT7-S Epo cells (a growth factor-dependent human megakaryoblastic cell line), we assessed that hnRNP C proteins are among the few proteins that bind to GST-Grb2 and GST-Grb3-3 (data not shown). Fig. 4 also shows that the P49L mutation of the N-SH3 domains of Grb2 and Grb3-3 did not modify the interaction with hnRNP C, whereas no binding was observed with C-SH3 mutants of Grb2 and Grb3-3. The interactions were also observed when nuclear extracts were previously treated with RNase (data not shown), indicating that Grb2/Grb3-3-hnRNP C interactions are not mediated by RNA strands. Taken together, these findings confirm the association of Grb2/Grb3-3 with hnRNP C and localize the interaction in the Grb2/Grb3-3 C-SH3 domains. Grb2 has been described to be localized mainly in membrane ruffles and in the cytoplasm (1Chardin P. Cussac D. Maignan S. Ducruix A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 34Bar-Sagi D. Rotin D. Batzer A. Mandiyan V. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1993; 74: 83-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), whereas hnRNP C proteins are restricted to the nucleus (35Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To evaluate the physiological relevance of the Grb2/Grb3-3-hnRNP C interactions it was important to determine whether Grb2/Grb3-3 were present in the nucleus. For this purpose, the localization of Grb2/Grb3-3 was investigated by subcellular fractionation. Western blot experiments performed on cytosol and nuclear fractions of Jurkat and UT7-S Epo cells showed that Grb2 is present in both fractions, whereas little or no Raf1 was found in the nuclear fractions and hnRNP C was absent from the cytosol fractions (Fig. 5). In addition, a similar localization for Grb3-3 was found on NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with grb3-3 (36Ramos-Morales F. Dominguez A. Rios R.M. Barroso S.I. Infante C. Schweighoffer F. Tocque B. Pintor-Toro J.A. Tortolero M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Thus, by subcellular fractionation, we demonstrate the presence of Grb2/Grb3-3 in the nucleus. Next, to investigate the interaction of Grb2 and hnRNP C proteins in the context of a living cell, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments with nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells. Anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the blots developed with anti-hnRNP C. Fig. 6 Ashows that hnRNP C proteins were detected in the anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates, whereas immunoprecipitates obtained with a preimmune serum contained no detectable hnRNP C. Furthermore, the anti-Grb2 antigenic peptide blocked immunoprecipitation of hnRNP C (Fig. 6 B). The reciprocal experiments, namely anti-hnRNP C immunoprecipitates immunoblotted with anti-Grb2, also yielded positive results (Fig. 6 C). Similar results were obtained with nuclear extracts from UT7-S Epo (data not shown). These data clearly demonstrate that endogenous Grb2 is able to interact with hnRNP C proteins in the nuclei of intact hematopoietic cells. hnRNP proteins can bind in vitro to different single-stranded ribo- and deoxyribopolynucleotides, suggesting that hnRNP proteins bind to heterogeneous nuclear RNA regardless of the nucleotide sequence (37Pullman J.M. Martin T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Thomas J.O. Glowacka S.K. Szer W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 171: 439-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 39Wilk H.E. Angeli G. Schafer K.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4592-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 40Conway G.

Biochem. 1988; 171: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, more stringent in vitro assays demonstrated that hnRNP proteins have preferences for specific sequences. For example, hnRNP C proteins have high avidity for poly(U) RNA (42Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To determine whether poly(U) RNA has a role in the association of Grb2/Grb3-3 with hnRNP C, we examined their binding in the presence or absence of poly(U) RNA. Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells were incubated with or without poly(U) RNA (50 μg/ml), followed by glutathione-agarose beads containing GST-Grb2 or GST-Grb3-3 fusion proteins. The resulting complexes were analyzed by Western blots with anti-hnRNP C. As shown in Fig. 7, poly(U) RNA abolished the Grb2-hnRNP C interaction, whereas it increased the Grb3-3-hnRNP C association. This effect was not observed with other RNA homopolymers (poly(rC), poly(rG), or poly(rA) RNA), and combination of any of these poly-RNAs with poly(U) RNA did not modify the effect induced by poly(U) RNA alone (data not shown). These findings indicate that the Grb2/Grb3-3-hnRNP C interactions are modulated by poly(U) RNA and suggest that the nature of these associations is different for Grb2 and for Grb3-3. In the last several years, the repertoire of complexes between RNPs and SH2- and SH3-containing proteins has increased (11Fumagalli S. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A.

Biol. 1995; 15: 186-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate new pathways involving Grb2 and Grb3-3, we studied their interactions with hnRNP proteins using different but complementary approaches. By the two-hybrid system, we demonstrated that Grb2 and Grb3-3 interact with a subclone of hnRNP C. hnRNP C1 and C2 bind strongly to sequences relevant to the processing of pre-mRNA, including the polypyrimidine stretch of introns (if uridine-rich) (44Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23074-23078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Malter J.S. Arrick B.A. Rigby W.F. J. Biol.

The hnRNP proteins can be divided into two groups according to their nucleocytoplasmic transport properties. One group is completely restricted to the nucleus in interphase cells, whereas the other group shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The hnRNP C proteins belong to the first group. They are restricted to the nucleus not because they lack a nuclear export signal but because they bear a nuclear retention sequence that is capable of overriding nuclear export signals (35Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To evaluate the physiological relevance of Grb2/Grb3-3-hnRNP C interactions, it was critical to determine the subcellular localization of Grb2 and Grb3-3. Our subcellular fractionation studies clearly demonstrate the presence of both proteins in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We estimated that 20% of endogenous Grb2 is found in the nucleus of Jurkat and UT7-S Epo cells. Most importantly, by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we showed the existence of endogenous Grb2-hnRNP C complexes in nuclear extracts from hematopoietic cells. Previous work performed by microinjection of GST-Grb2 fusion protein in REF-52 cells did not describe its presence in the nuclei (34Bar-Sagi D. Rotin D. Batzer A. Mandiyan V. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1993; 74: 83-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The explanation of this discrepancy may lie in the addition of the GST, which may alter the normal behavior of the native protein and prevent its nuclear localization (47Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Binding studies with GST fusion proteins localized the domain involved in interaction with the endogenous hnRNP C proteins to the C-SH3 of Grb2 and Grb3-3 since these associations were completely abolished by G203R and G162R mutants. However, in the two-hybrid system interactions were prevented only in the double mutants (P49L-G203R and P49L-G162R), suggesting that the N-SH3 may participate in the binding. It should be noted that in the two-hybrid system only a fragment of hnRNP C (residues 120–290 of hnRNP C) was tested. Therefore, the constraints for the binding imposed by the structure of the native protein may be overridden in the v90 polypeptide. Therefore, the interactions are more likely mediated by the C-SH3 domains in vivo. Although Grb2 and Grb3-3 use the same domain to bind to hnRNP C proteins, our results indicate that the nature of the association must be different. As expected for a conventional SH3-mediated interaction, mutation of the only proline-rich motif in hnRNP C suppressed the binding to Grb2, but, surprisingly, interaction with Grb3-3 remained unchanged. We localized the Grb3-3 binding site to a more extended region (residues 120–209 of hnRNP C1) probably involving a conformational motif, as judged by the finding that other subclones containing the potential interaction region were unable to associate with Grb3-3. These results suggest that significant differences exist between Grb2 and Grb3-3 in their interactions with common partners. This view is supported by the results of the two-hybrid system in which point mutations in either of the SH3 domains of Grb3-3 completely disrupted the association with hSos1 (residues 1131–1333), whereas in the case of Grb2 this phenotype was only obtained with the double mutant. Our results are in agreement with previous observations showing that, although both Grb2 and Grb3-3 bound to hSos1 in an SH3-dependent manner, there were qualitative differences in their respective binding to the exchange factor (10Rey I. Fath I. Parker F. Haun F. Schweighoffer F. Tocqué B. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 105-111PubMed Google Scholar). The hnRNP complexes contain at least 20 major proteins with different RNA binding specificities. hnRNP C proteins have striking avidity for poly(U) RNA (42Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the role of poly(U) RNA in Grb2/Grb3-3-hnRNP C interactions. We clearly show that, whereas Grb2 only binds to hnRNP C in the absence of poly(U) RNA, Grb3-3-hnRNP C interaction is enhanced by the presence of poly(U) RNA. Other RNA homopolymers do not have this effect. Four Grb3-3 partners have been identified so far: hSos1 (10Rey I. Fath I. Parker F. Haun F. Schweighoffer F. Tocqué B. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 105-111PubMed Google Scholar), Vav (18Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Schweighoffer F. Bismuth G. Camonis J. Tortolero M. Fischer S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1665-1669PubMed Google Scholar), adenosine deaminase (36Ramos-Morales F. Dominguez A. Rios R.M. Barroso S.I. Infante C. Schweighoffer F. Tocque B. Pintor-Toro J.A. Tortolero M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and now hnRNP C proteins. However, we report for the first time that an interaction of Grb3-3 is regulated. The physiological significance of these interactions remains to be determined. The localization of Grb2 in the nucleus opens new perspectives. Up to now, Grb2 has been shown to be involved in signal transduction from tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors to cytosolic partners. Our results suggest that Grb2 might also be involved in communicating signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Another possibility is that Grb2 functions as an adaptor protein in the nucleus. It would be interesting to identify tyrosine-phosphorylated partners of Grb2 in the nucleus. Very recently, Nck, another adaptor molecule without a nuclear localization signal, has been found in the nuclei of NIH3T3 and A431 cells in association with Sam68 (48Lawe D.C. Hahn C. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Specific binding partners have also been identified for SH2 and SH3 domains of the adaptor protein c-Crk in cytosolic and nuclear lysates (49Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1465-1473PubMed Google Scholar). These studies, together with our results, suggest that there might be signal transduction mechanisms in the nucleus. The fact that Grb2/Grb3-3-hnRNP C interactions are regulated by poly(U) RNA greatly enhances the physiological relevance of these associations. Nuclear retention sequence-bearing proteins, like hnRNP C, have been suggested to retain pre-mRNA in the nucleus (35Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The removal of hnRNP C from pre-mRNA/mRNA is likely to be involved in mRNA export from the nucleus. It is possible that Grb2 and Grb3-3 participate in this function. On the other hand, it has been reported that increased expression of Grb3-3 coincides temporally with extensive cell death in some tissues (9Fath I. Schweighoffer F. Rey I. Multon M.C. Boiziau J. Duchesne M. Tocque B. Science. 1994; 264: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Rey I. Fath I. Parker F. Haun F. Schweighoffer F. Tocqué B. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 105-111PubMed Google Scholar). However, further experiments will be necessary to investigate the hypothetical involvement of Grb3-3·hnRNP C complexes in apoptosis. In summary, we detected Grb2/Grb3-3 in the nucleus and identify hnRNP C proteins as nuclear partners of Grb2 and Grb3-3. Furthermore, we postulate that Grb3-3 is not only an SH2 mutated form of Grb2, but that its structure is changed such that the SH3-mediated binding to hnRNP C is modified and might participate in different functions. We thank G. Dreyfuss for anti-hnRNP C antibody and S. Gisselbrecht, I. Dusanter-Fourt, and J. Richardson for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2314573122,"Cell cycle progression and apoptosis are controlled by regulatory proteins, including p53, of which functional alterations are linked to carcinogenesis. Recently, malignant mesothelioma (MM), a primary tumour related to asbestos exposure, alternatively to post therapeutic radiations, has proven to be an important problem in oncogenesis. The p53 protein does not seem mutated or deleted in MM but a possible inactivation by binding to other proteins [mdm2; SV40 large T antigen (Tag)] has been suggested. The present work investigated cell cycle regulation in normal rat pleural mesothelial cells (RPMC) and in RPMC expressing Tag (RPMC-TSV40), under exposure to asbestos and radiations. In RPMC, these agents induced activation of cell cycle checkpoints located at G1/S and G2/M and/or mitosis but a lack of control at G1/S was found in RPMC-TSV40. A loss of G2/M control may account for the formation of micronuclei observed after exposure of RPMC-TSV40 to radiations. In RPMC-TSV40 the enhancement of abnormal mitoses and apoptosis after asbesto exposure, in comparison with RPMC, suggests a loss of mitotic control and a p53-independent mechanism of apoptosis. Thus Tag expression in mesothelial cells might have both adverse and beneficial effects by impairing the control of DNA integrity and enhancing apoptosis respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2051832555,"In order to identify genes capable of inhibiting apoptosis induced by different pathways, without inducing proliferation we have performed retroviral insertion mutagenesis in the IL-3 dependent bone marrow derived Baf-3 cell line. Out of 200 mutants obtained in three separate mutagenesis experiments, four mutants were resistant to multiple apoptosis inducing pathways (including growth factor starvation, staurosporine, etoposide and cyclosporin A) and did not proliferate in the absence of IL-3. These four mutants overexpress the bcl-X gene following a retroviral insertion 5′ of the translation initiation site. These results indicate that the bcl-X gene is a major pleiotropic anti-apoptotic gene in Baf-3 cells. They also suggest that the Bcl-2 family of genes might be the only one capable of inhibiting apoptosis induced by multiple pathways without inducing cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2332268545,"An abnormal stimulation of the cAMP pathway has been recognized as the primary event in various pathological situations that lead to goitrogenesis or thyroid tumors. Thyroid adenomas are monoclonal neoplasms that become independent of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in their secretory function and growth. Mutated forms of the TSH receptor (TSHR) and the adenylyl cyclase-activating Gs alpha protein, which confer a constitutive activity on these proteins, have been observed in human adenomas. The FRTL-5 rat thyroid cell line is a permanent but untransformed line; the growth of which depends on the presence of TSH, and at least in part, on the stimulation of the cAMP pathway. In order to compare the oncogenic potential of the activated mutant Gs alpha protein and the constitutively activated TSHR, we have transfected FRTL-5 cells with an expression vector bearing either the cDNA of the Gs alpha gene carrying the A201S mutation or the cDNA of the TSH receptor carrying the M453T mutation recently identified in a case of congenital hyperthyroidism. The expression of these two cDNAs was driven by the bovine thyroglobulin gene promoter. We show that, although the expression of both the Gs alpha or TSHR mutant proteins leads to TSH-independent proliferation and to constitutive cAMP accumulation in FRTL-5 cells, only the mutant TSHR is able to induce neoplastic transformation, as demonstrated by growth in semi-solid medium and tumorigenesis in nude mice."
https://openalex.org/W2019760369,"The Ras and Rap1A proteins can bind to the Raf and RalGDS families. Ras and Rap1A have Glu and Lys, respectively, at position 31. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of mutating the Glu at position 31 of the c-Ha-Ras protein to Asp, Ala, Arg, and Lys on the interactions with Raf-1 and RalGDS. The Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1 binds the E31R and E31K Ras mutants less tightly than the wild-type, E31A, and E31D Ras proteins; the introduction of the positively charged Lys or Arg residue at position 31 specifically impairs the binding of Ras with the Raf-1 RBD. On the other hand, the ability of the oncogenic RasG12V protein to activate Raf-1 in HEK293 cells was only partially reduced by the E31R mutation but was drastically impaired by the E31K mutation. Correspondingly, RasG12V(E31K) as well as Rap1A, but not RasG12V(E31R), exhibited abnormally tight binding with the cysteine-rich domain of Raf-1. On the other hand, the E31A, E31R, and E31K mutations, but not the E31D mutation, enhanced the RalGDS RBD-binding activity of Ras, indicating that the negative charge at position 31 of Ras is particularly unfavorable to the interaction with the RalGDS RBD. RasG12V(E31K), RasG12V(E31A), and Rap1A stimulate the RalGDS action more efficiently than the wild-type Ras in the liposome reconstitution assay.

Recently, however, the RalGDS RBD was shown to have a ubiquitin-like fold similar to that of the Raf-1 RBD (14Huang L. Weng X. Hofer F. Martin G.S. Kim S.-H. Nat. Struct.

The Rap1A (or Krev-1) protein belongs to the Ras superfamily, and has the same amino acid sequence in the effector region as that of Ras (16Kawata M. Matsui M. Kondo J. Hishida T. Teranishi Y.

However, at position 31, Rap1A has Lys, whereas Ras has Glu. The RalGDS RBD prefers Rap1A to Ras, but the Raf-1 RBD prefers Ras to Rap1A (19Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the complexes of the Raf-1 RBD with Rap1A·GMPPNP (the wild-type and the E30D/K31E mutant) have been solved by x-ray crystallography (20Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C.

Biol. 1996; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In these two complex structures, Lys84 of the Raf-1 RBD is not involved in the interaction with the wild-type Rap1A but forms strong and weak salt bridges with Glu31 and Asp33, respectively, of the E30D/K31E mutant Rap1A. The replacement of Lys by Glu at position 31 of Rap1A increased the affinity for the Raf-1 RBD and decreased that for the RalGDS RBD (21Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Block C. Janknecht R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It was proposed, therefore, that the negative charge of Glu31 creates a favorable complementary interface for the Ras-Raf interaction (21Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Block C. Janknecht R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We have found that the Rap1A-type E31K and D30E/E31K mutations impair the GAP-induced increase in the Ras GTPase activity and the ability to induce neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells (22Shirouzu M. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Ito Y. Koide H. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 475-480PubMed Google Scholar). Other groups have also reported that the E31K and D30E/E31K mutations reduce the transforming activity of oncogenic Ras in NIH3T3 cells (23Marshall M.S. Davis L.J. Keys R.D. Mosser S.D. Hill W.S.

In the present study, to analyze in more detail how the Glu residue at position 31 of Ras is involved in the interaction with the two different targets, we tested more mutations at position 31 for their effects on various Ras functions. Mutations were introduced into a synthetic human c-Ha-ras gene (25Miura K. Inoue Y. Nakamori H. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Ikehara M. Noguchi S. Nishimura S. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1986; 77: 45-51PubMed Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis with two PCR steps. The ras genes with the mutations in the oncogenic G12V background were subcloned into pMAMneo (CLONTECH) (22Shirouzu M. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Ito Y. Koide H. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S.

To prepare the Raf-1 RBD as a GST fusion protein, the DNA fragment corresponding to amino acid residues 51–131 was amplified by PCR from the human full-length raf-1 gene (27Bonner T.I. Kerby S.B.

The gene for the rat RalGDS RBD was prepared by PCR with the primers, GCGCGGATCCTCACTGCCTCTCTACAACCAGCAGGTG and GCGCGTCGACTTAGAAGATGCCTTTGGCAATCCTGAG, from a rat brain cDNA library (CLONTECH). To prepare the GST fusion form of the RalGDS RBD, the PCR product was digested with BamHI and SalI and was then inserted into the BamHI-SalI sites of pGEX-4T-1. The wild-type and mutant Ras proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and were purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and Sephadex G-75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) columns as described (22Shirouzu M.

Ten h after transfection, the cells were serum starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After a 24-hr starvation, the cells were lysed in 300 μl of 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and were centrifuged at 18,500 × g for 10 min to remove the cell debris. From the supernatant, the Raf-1 protein was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Raf-1 antibody C12 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Cell extracts (20 μg/assay) were electrophoresed in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis using an anti-ERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Chem. 1995; 270: 4661-4667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell extracts were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (12%) containing myelin basic protein (0.5 mg/ml) as the substrate for ERK. After denaturation and renaturation, the gels were incubated for the kinase reaction and were subjected to autoradiography to detect the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein. RalGDS activity to stimulate the dissociation of GDP from Ral in the liposomes was measured as described (36Kishida S. Koyama S. Matsubara K. Kishida M. Matsuura Y. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2899-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, liposomes were made by sonication of dried lipids containing phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. The post-translationally modified [3H]GDP-bound form of GST-Ral and GTPγS-bound form of GST-Ras, GST-Rap1A, GST-RasG12V(E31K), or RasG12V(E31A) were made, added to the liposomes, and incubated for 10 min on ice in 400 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.67 mm EDTA, 1 mm n-octylglucoside (1/25 of critical micellar concentration), 1 mm DTT, and 0.06 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The mixture was centrifuged on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient at 100,000 × gfor 2 h at 4 °C, and the liposomes were recovered at the 0.15–1.2 m sucrose interface. GST-RalGDSb was incubated with the liposomes that contained the [3H]GDP-bound form of GST-Ral (0.5 pmol) and the GTPγS-bound form of GST-Ras, GST-Rap1A, GST-RasG12V(E31K), or RasG12V(E31A) (1.5–2 pmol) in 80 μl of reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm GTP, 0.031% CHAPS, and 1 mm DTT) for 30 min at 30 °C. Assays were quantified by rapid filtration on nitrocellulose filters (41Albright C.F. Giddings B.W. Liu J. Vito M. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To determine which properties of the amino acid residue at position 31 of Ras are necessary for the interactions with its targets, Raf-1 and RalGDS, we substituted the Glu31 of the c-Ha-Ras protein by Asp, Ala, and Arg and analyzed the effects of these mutations, as well as those of the previously reported Lys mutation. First, we examined the effects of the E31D, E31A, E31R, and E31K mutations on the interaction of Ras with the Raf-1 RBD (amino acid residues 51–131 of Raf-1). Various concentrations of each mutant Ras protein in the GTPγS-bound form were added to the GST-Raf-1(51–131) fusion protein mixed with glutathione-Sepharose, and the amounts of the Ras protein in the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1). The Ras(E31D) and Ras(E31A) mutant proteins were found to bind the Raf-1 RBD as strongly as the wild-type Ras (Fig. 1). In contrast, the E31R and E31K mutations reduced the extent of the Raf-1 RBD binding by about 5-fold (Fig. 1). It has been reported that Glu31 and Asp33 of the Ras-type mutant of the Rap1A protein (E30D/K31E) make stronger and weaker salt bridges, respectively, with Lys84 of the Raf-1 RBD (21Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Block C. Janknecht R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and that the K84A mutation drastically reduced the affinity of the Raf-1 RBD for Ras·GTP (42Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that the salt bridge between Lys84 of Raf-1 and Glu31 of Ras is also important for the Ras·Raf association (21Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Block C. Janknecht R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, this study showed that the Ras(E31A) mutant can bind to the Raf-1 RBD as efficiently as the wild-type Ras. Therefore, the introduction of a basic residue at position 31 causes significant repulsion between Ras and the Raf-1 RBD, whereas the acidic residue characteristic of Ras does not appear to create any attractive interface for the Ras-Raf interaction. On the other hand, the D33A mutation of Ras impaired its ability to bind the Raf-1 RBD. 2M. Shirouzu, K. Hashimoto, and S. Yokoyama, unpublished data. Consistently, it was reported that the D33N mutation of Ras causes a drastic reduction in the affinity for a Raf-1 fragment containing the RBD (4Chuang E. Barnard D. Hettich L. Zhang X.-F. Avruch J. Marshall M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5318-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, for Ras binding with the Raf-1 RBD, the salt bridge from the Lys84of Raf-1 to the Asp33 of Ras is much more important than that to the Glu31 of Ras. This difference in the interactions of the Raf-1 RBD with Glu31 and Asp33 between the Ras and Rap1A backgrounds may be due to the structural differences at other positions within these proteins; Ras has Ile21 and His27, corresponding to the Rap1A residues Val21 and Ile27, respectively, which are involved in the interface with the Raf-1 RBD in the crystal structure (20Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Next, to examine the effect of these mutations on the ability of Ras to activate Raf-1, we transfected HEK293 cells with each mutant ras gene in the oncogenic G12V background. The anti-Raf-1 immunoprecipitate was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of MAPKK and the KN-MAPK, and the incorporation of 32P into the KN-MAPK was quantitated (Fig. 2 A). The amounts of the mutant Ras proteins expressed in HEK293 cells were nearly the same (Fig. 2 B). The E31A and E31D mutations had no effects on the stimulation of the MAPKK kinase activity of Raf-1. On the other hand, the Raf-1 activation activity of Ras was partially impaired by the E31R mutation and, furthermore, was drastically decreased by the E31K mutation. To analyze the effects of these mutations on the activities of Ras in another cell type, pheochromocytoma (PC) 12 cells were stably transfected with pMAMneo vectors that conditionally express the RasG12V, RasG12V(E31D), RasG12V(E31A), RasG12V(E31R), or RasG12V (E31K) protein. The RasG12V(E31K)-expressing cells did not extend neurites, as reported (22Shirouzu M. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Ito Y. Koide H. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 475-480PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the RasG12V(E31D)-, RasG12V(E31A)-, and RasG12V(E31R)-expressing cells extended neurites as well as the cells expressing RasG12V (Fig. 3). The expression levels of RasG12V, RasG12V(E31D), RasG12V(E31A), and RasG12V(E31R) were nearly the same (Fig. 4 A). The level of RasG12V(E31K) was slightly lower than those of other mutants, probably because of its autoinhibitory activity (22Shirouzu M. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Ito Y. Koide H. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 475-480PubMed Google Scholar), but was nevertheless sufficiently higher than that of the endogenous Ras (Fig. 4 A). In conclusion, the neurite-inducing activity of RasG12V was abolished by the E31K mutation but not affected by the E31D, E31A, and E31R mutations (Fig. 3). It should be emphasized that the E31K mutation impairs this function of Ras much more drastically than the E31R mutation. Furthermore, the abilities of these RasG12V, RasG12V(E31A), RasG12V(E31D), RasG12V(E31R), and RasG12V(E31K) mutants to induce ERK activation in PC12 cells were examined from delayed mobility of the phosphorylated form on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 B) and also by an in-gel kinase assay (data not shown). The ERK activities in the RasG12V(E31A)-, RasG12V(E31D)-, and RasG12V(E31R)-expressing cells were elevated as well as in the RasG12V-expressing cells (Fig. 4 B). On the other hand, in the cell expressing RasG12V(E31K), the ERK activity was the same as in the control cell. In summary, the abilities of the Ras mutants to activate Raf-1 correlate with their abilities to induce ERK activation and also with the induction of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Therefore, the inability of RasG12V(E31K) to induce neurite outgrowth is probably due to the inability to activate Raf.Figure 4ERK activation by the Ras mutants in PC12 cells. Extracts of PC12 cells, prepared 12 h after the induction of the indicated mutant Ras protein with dexamethasone, were electrophoresed in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. A, immunoblotting detection of cell lysates of Ras mutants with the anti-Ras antibody RAS004. B, endogenous ERKs were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-ERK antibody. The phosphorylated, activated forms of ERK1/2 display reduced electrophoretic mobilities. The bands corresponding to ERK1/2 are indicated with arrows. In panels A and B, control, the normal PC12 cells were treated with dexamethasone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Ras activation of Raf-1 in both HEK293 and PC12 cells was decreased more severely by the E31K mutation than by the E31R mutation, although Ras(E31R) and Ras(E31K) had nearly the same Raf-1 RBD-binding activities. Recently, we found that Ras binds to the Raf-1 CRD (amino acid residues 132–206) in a GTP-independent manner, which is necessary for the activation of Raf-1 (6Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) while another group reported a weak GTP-dependence of the binding of Ras with the Raf-1 CRD (5Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S. Campbell-Burk S. Bell R.M. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9809-9812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that RasG12V(E31K) as well as Rap1A has an abnormally enhanced ability to bind the Raf-1 CRD (30Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Kotani G. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11702-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It seems to be through this abnormal interaction of Lys31 with the Raf-1 CRD that Rap1AG12V and RasG12V(E31K) dominantly inhibit the Raf-1 activation by RasG12V, which is related to the Ras-antagonizing activity of Rap1A (30Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Kotani G. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11702-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the ability of RasG12V(E31R) to bind to the Raf-1 CRD. Since the binding of Ras to the CRD requires post-translational modification of the C terminus of Ras, we purified the modified form of RasG12V(E31R) from Sf9 cells, and used it for the Raf-1 CRD binding assay. The RasG12V(E31R) was shown to bind the Raf-1 CRD as strongly as Ras (the GTPγS-bound forms, Fig. 5; and the GDP-bound forms, data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that the difference in the Raf-1 activation ability between the E31K and E31R mutants is due to the difference in the ability to bind the Raf-1 CRD. The reason why the extent of Raf-1 activation by RasG12V(E31K) is much lower than that by RasG12V(E31R) may be that RasG12V(E31K) autoinhibits the Raf-1 activation. The present mutagenesis analyses indicate that the wild-type Glu31 residue of Ras is not required for interaction with either RBD or CRD of Raf-1. In contrast, the Lys residue replacing Glu31 appears to interact with the Raf-1 CRD. It is interesting that the Raf-1 CRD very specifically recognizes the amino acid at position 31 and prefers Lys to Arg. As in the case of the Raf-1 RBD, we tested the Ras(E31D), Ras(E31A), Ras(E31R), and Ras(E31K) mutant proteins in the GTPγS-bound form for their abilities to bind with a GST fusion protein of the rat RalGDS RBD, the C-terminal 127 residues corresponding to the mouse RalGDS RBD (10Spaargaren M. Bischoff J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12609-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Ras(E31A), Ras(E31R), and Ras(E31K) mutants bound the RalGDS RBD more tightly than the wild-type Ras (Fig. 6). In contrast, the E31D mutation did not affect the interaction of Ras with the RalGDS RBD. This indicates that the negative charge at position 31 of Ras particularly weakens the interaction with the RalGDS RBD. The affinities of Ras for the Raf-1 RBD and Rap1A for the RalGDS RBD are 100 times higher than those of Ras for the RalGDS RBD and Rap1A for the Raf-1 RBD, respectively (19Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the K31E mutation of Rap1A has been reported to cause a 15-fold increase in the affinity of Rap1A for the Raf-1 RBD and a 20-fold decrease in that for the RalGDS RBD (21Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Block C. Janknecht R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Symmetrically, in this study, the E31K mutation of Ras was found to decrease the Raf-1 RBD-binding (about 5-fold) and to increase the RalGDS RBD-binding (about 5-fold). Therefore, not only in the Rap1A background (21Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Block C. Janknecht R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) but also in the Ras background, the residue at position 31 serves as the determinant for the preference of either the Raf-1 RBD or the RalGDS RBD. On the other hand, the modes of Ras binding are similar between the Raf-1 and RalGDS RBDs, in that only one type of charge at position 31 of Ras is particularly unfavorable; binding is weaker with positively and negatively charged side chains, respectively, than with oppositely charged (negatively and positively, respectively) and neutral side chains, at position 31. Actually, it has recently been reported that the RalGDS RBD has a fold similar to that of the Raf-1 RBD (14Huang L. Weng X. Hofer F. Martin G.S. Kim S.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Geyer M. Herrmann C. Wohlgemuth S. Wittinghofer A. Kalbitzer H.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Ras, but not Rap1A, can activate the GDP/GTP exchange activity of RalGDS toward Ral in COS cells (13Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and that RalGDS stimulated the dissociation of GDP from Ral more strongly in the presence of Rap1A·GTPγS than Ras·GTPγS in the reconstitution assay (36Kishida S. Koyama S. Matsubara K. Kishida M. Matsuura Y. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2899-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The discrepancy of the action of Rap1A on RalGDS between intact cell and cell-free systems might be due to the different subcellular distribution of Rap1A and Ral. In this study, we used this reconstitution system to analyze the RalGDS-binding abilities of RasG12V(E31A) and RasG12V(E31K). When the GTPγS-bound form of RasG12V(E31A) or RasG12V(E31K) was incorporated with Ral in the liposomes, RalGDS stimulated the dissociation of GDP from Ral (Fig. 7). These Ras mutants, as well as Rap1A, exhibited higher RalGDS activation activities than that of the wild-type Ras. Thus, in the reconstitution assay system, the RalGDS-activation activity of Ras/Rap1A depends on the RalGDS RBD-binding activity. All of the results of the present study demonstrate that the sharp contrast between Ras and Rap1A, in terms of the Raf-1 and RalGDS interactions, depends on the characteristics of their residues at position 31. Intriguingly, the mechanisms of these interactions appear to be different from the attraction of the charge at this position for the target domain. The technical assistance of A. Kamiya and K.

https://openalex.org/W2319744538,"Deregulation of the S-phase promoting E2F-1 transcription factor has been shown to cooperate with p53 to induce apoptosis. BaF3 cells undergo rapid, p53-dependent apoptosis when irradiated in the absence of IL-3. Rapid apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation (IR) coincides with attenuated p21(WAF1/Cip1) induction. Failure to adequately induce p21 could result in inappropriate release of E2F from Rb which may then cooperate with p53 to induce apoptosis in cells deprived of growth factor. We engineered BaF3 cells to express exogenous p21 and tested whether overexpressing p21 in cells irradiated in the absence of IL-3 protects from IR-induced apoptosis. Enforced p21 expression resulted in a consistent, but partial, protection of cells from undergoing IR-induced apoptosis. However, deregulating E2F activity through expression of HPV E7 failed to sensitize cells to IR-induced apoptosis in the presence of IL-3. Together, these data strongly suggest that the IL-3-responsive factors which modulate p53-mediated apoptosis in BaF3 cells are largely independent of G1 cell cycle checkpoint control mediated by p21."
https://openalex.org/W2317018376,"The conserved region 3 (CR3) of the E7 protein of human papillomaviruses contains two CXXC motifs involved in zinc binding and in the homodimerization of the molecule. Studies have suggested that the intact CXXC motifs in the CR3 of HPV16 and HPV18 E7 are required for the in vitro transforming activity of these proteins. CR3 also contains a low affinity pRb binding site and is involved in the disruption of the E2F/Rb1 complex. E7 is structurally and functionally related to Adenovirus E1A protein, which also has two CXXC motifs in CR3. However, the Ad E1A transforming activity appears to be independent of the presence of such domains. In fact, this viral protein exists in vivo as two different forms of 289 and 243 amino acids. The shorter Ad E1A form (Ad E1A243), where both CXXC motifs are deleted by internal splicing, retains its in vitro transforming activity. We have investigated if the HPV16 E7 CR3 can be functionally replaced by the Ad E1A243 CR3, which lacks both CXXC motifs. A chimeric protein (E7/E1A243) containing the CR1 and CR2 of HPV16 E7 fused to the CR3 of Ad E1A 243 was constructed. The E7/E1A243 while not able to homo-dimerize in the S. cerevisiae two-hybrid system retains several of the properties of the parental proteins, HPV16 E7 and Ad E1A. It associates with the `pocket' proteins, induces growth in soft agar of NIH3T3 cells and immortalizes rat embryo fibroblasts. These data suggest that the CXXC motifs in CR3 of E7 do not play a direct role in the transforming properties of this viral protein but probably are important for maintaining the correct protein configuration."
