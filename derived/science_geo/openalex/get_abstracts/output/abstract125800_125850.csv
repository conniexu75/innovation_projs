https://openalex.org/W2094648676,"Novel approaches for the generation of more effective vaccines for HIV-1 are of significant importance. In this report we analyze the immunogenicity and efficacy of an HIV-1 DNA vaccine encoding env, rev and gag/pol in a chimpanzee model system. The immunized animals developed specific cellular and humoral immune responses. Animals were challenged with a heterologous chimpanzee titered stock of HIV-1 SF2 virus and followed for 48 weeks after challenge. Polymerase chain reaction coupled with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) results indicated infection in the control animal, whereas those animals vaccinated with the DNA constructs were protected from the establishment of infection. These studies serve as an important benchmark for the use of DNA vaccine technology for the production of protective immune responses."

https://openalex.org/W1987124995,"Leukotoxin is a linoleic acic oxide produced by leukocytes and has been associated with the multiple organ failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome seen in some severe burn patients. Leukotoxin has been reported to be toxic when injected into animals intravenously. Herein, we report that this lipid is not directly cytotoxic in at least two in vitro systems. Using a baculovirus expression system we demonstrate that leukotoxin is only cytotoxic in the presence of epoxide hydrolases. In addition, it is the diol metabolite that proves toxic to pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells, suggesting a critical role for the diol in leukotoxin-associated respiratory disease. In vivo data also support the toxicity of leukotoxin diol. For the first time we demonstrate that soluble epoxide hydrolase can bioactivate epoxides to diols that are apparently cytotoxic. Thus leukotoxin should be regarded as a protoxin corresponding to the more toxic diol. This clearly has implications for designing new clinical interventions."

This requirement can be relieved by inactivation of the cytosine 5'diphosphate (CDP)-choline pathway for phosphatidy1choline biosynthesis, indicating that Secl4p is an essential component of a regulatory pathway linking phospholipid metabolism with vesicle trafficking (the Secl4p pathway1-6). Sac1p (refs 7 and 8) is an integral membrane protein related to inositol-5-phosphatases such as synaptojanin9, a protein found in rat brain. Here we show that defects in Sac1p also relieve the requirement for Secl4p by altering phospholipid metabolism so as to expand the pool of diacylglycerol (DAG) in the Golgi. Moreover, although shortchain DAG improves secretory function in strains with a temperature-sensitive Secl4p, expression of diacylglycerol kinase from Escherichia coli further impairs it. The essential function of Sec14p may therefore be to maintain a sufficient pool of DAG in the Golgi to support the production of secretory vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W2042894300,"Glucose-6-phosphatase, a key enzyme in the homeostatic regulation of blood glucose concentration, catalyzes the terminal step in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Glucose, the product of the glucose-6-phosphatase reaction, dramatically increases the level of glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA transcripts in primary hepatocytes (20-fold), and the maximum response is obtained at a glucose concentration as low as 11 mm. Glucose specifically increases glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA and L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA. In the rat hepatoma-derived cell line, Fao, glucose increases the glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA only modestly (3-fold). In the presence of high glucose concentrations, overexpression of glucokinase in Fao cells via recombinant adenovirus vectors increases lactate production to the level found in primary hepatocytes and increases glucose-6-phosphatase gene expression by 21-fold. Similar overexpression of hexokinase I in Fao cells with high levels of glucose does not increase lactate production nor does it change the response of glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA to glucose. Glucokinase overexpression in Fao cells blunts the previously reported inhibitory effect of insulin on glucose-6-phosphatase gene expression in these cells.Raising the cellular concentration of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a potent effector of the direction of carbon flux through the gluconeogenic and glycolytic pathways, also stimulated glucose-6-phosphatase gene expression in Fao cells. Increasing the fructose-2,6-bisphosphate concentration over a 15-fold range (12 ± 1 to 187 ± 17 pmol/plate) via an adenoviral vector overexpression system, led to a 6-fold increase (0.32 ± 0.03 to 2.2 ± 0.33 arbitrary units of mRNA) in glucose-6-phosphatase gene expression with a concomitant increase in glycolysis and a decrease in gluconeogenesis. Also, the effects of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate concentrations on fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene expression were stimulatory, leading to a 5–6-fold increase in mRNA level over a 15-fold range in fructose-2,6-bisphosphate level. Liver pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA were unchanged by the manipulation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate level. Glucose-6-phosphatase, a key enzyme in the homeostatic regulation of blood glucose concentration, catalyzes the terminal step in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.

Overproduction of glucose by the liver is the major cause of fasting hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus (1DeFronzo R.A. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 667-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rossetti L.

The terminal step in glucose production from the gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways in the liver is catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase (Glu-6-Pase), 1The abbreviations used are: Glu-6-Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; Fru-1,6-P2ase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; 6-PF-2-K/Fru-2,6-P2ase, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase; Fru-2,6-P2, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate; L-PK, liver type pyruvate kinase; GK, glucokinase; HKI, hexokinase I; 6-PF-1-kinase, 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase; Glu-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; Fru-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; FBS, fetal bovine serum; BSA, bovine serum albumin; kb, kilobase pair(s); pfu, plaque-forming unit(s). a key enzyme in the homeostatic regulation of blood glucose concentration (3Nordlie R.C.

Med. 1939; 39: 337-338Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). With the recent availability of cDNA clones for the Glu-6-Pase catalytic subunit (5Shelly L.L. Lei K.-J. Pan C.-J. Sakata S.F. Ruppert S.

Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), it has become possible to study the regulation of gene expression for this enzyme in different hormonal and nutritional states. Increased Glu-6-Pase mRNA, protein, and activity have been found in several diabetic rat models, e.g. diabetic BB rats (7Haber B.A. Chin S. Chuang E. Buikhuisen W. Naji A. Taub R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (8Liu Z. Barrett E.J. Dalkin A.C. Zwart A.D. Chou J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Argaud D. Zhang Q. Pan W. Maitra S. Pilkis S.J. Lange A.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of hormonal regulation of the Glu-6-Pase catalytic subunit have shown that its mRNA levels are modulated similarly to that of other gluconeogenic enzymes, such as PEPCK and Fru-1,6-Pase (9Argaud D. Zhang Q. Pan W. Maitra S. Pilkis S.J. Lange A.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lange A.J. Argaud D. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pan W. Maitra S.R. Pilkis S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Insulin decreases the activity and mRNA levels of the Glu-6-Pase catalytic subunit, whereas cAMP and glucocorticoids increase mRNA levels (10Lange A.J. Argaud D. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pan W. Maitra S.R. Pilkis S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The action of insulin is dominant over the action of glucocorticoids in Fao cells (10Lange A.J. Argaud D. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pan W. Maitra S.R. Pilkis S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We have observed a stimulatory regulation of Glu-6-Pase mRNA levels by glucose. Glucose increases mRNA levels of the Glu-6-Pase catalytic subunit in rat hepatoma cells (9Argaud D. Zhang Q. Pan W. Maitra S. Pilkis S.J. Lange A.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lange A.J. Argaud D. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pan W. Maitra S.R. Pilkis S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In an in vivo model, hyperglycemia per se stimulates hepatic Glu-6-Pase expression in diabetic rats (11Massillon D. Barzilai N. Chen W. Hu M. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9871-9874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Also, the levels of Glu-6-Pase mRNA in liver from rat refed with a high carbohydrate diet are very high compared with PEPCK mRNA levels (9Argaud D. Zhang Q. Pan W. Maitra S. Pilkis S.J. Lange A.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose stimulation of gene expression has previously been established for glycolytic enzymes, L-PK (12Decaux J.-F. Antoine B. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11584-11590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and aldolase B (13Decaux J.-F. Marcillat O. Pichard A.L. Henry J. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3432-3438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and for lipogenic enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty-acid synthase (14Foufelle F. Gouhot B. Pégorier J.-P. Perdereau D. Girard J. Ferré P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20543-20546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not for gluconeogenic enzymes. In the regulation of glycolytic enzyme expression, the glucose effect on gene expression has been related to glucose metabolism. In one report, glucokinase expression has been linked to glucose stimulation of L-PK gene expression (15Doiron B. Cuif M.-H. Kahn A. Diaz-Guerra M.-J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10213-10216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, 2-deoxyglucose, a glucose analog that is phosphorylated in cells, stimulates fatty-acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene expression, whereas 3-O-methylglucose, which is transported into the cell but not metabolized, has no effect (14Foufelle F. Gouhot B. Pégorier J.-P. Perdereau D. Girard J. Ferré P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20543-20546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we characterize the effect of glucose on the level of Glu-6-Pase message in primary hepatocytes, the system that has been used to demonstrate the effect of glucose on L-PK gene expression (12Decaux J.-F. Antoine B. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11584-11590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured cells have an advantage over in vivo models because they allow us to study specific changes in glucose concentration without inducing hormonal changes. We determined the specificity of glucose stimulation of Glu-6-Pase, L-PK, and several messages of glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes such as PEPCK, Fru-1,6-Pase, 6-PF-2-K/Fru-2,6-P2ase, and GK. Since glucose metabolism is necessary for a glucose effect on gene expression, we examined the relationship between the response of Glu-6-Pase mRNA levels to glucose, to the levels of GK activity, and to glycolytic flux in primary hepatocytes and in Fao hepatoma cells. To correlate changes in Glu-6-Pase mRNA levels with changes in glucose metabolism, we manipulated the glycolytic flux in Fao cells by overexpressing GK via an adenovirus-mediated technique and measured the effect of glucose on Glu-6-Pase gene expression. Here we also report the effect of cellular Fru-2,6-P2concentration on the regulation of Glu-6-Pase gene expression in Fao cells. The cellular Fru-2,6-P2 concentration was manipulated via an adenovirus vector system (16Argaud D. Lange A.J. Becker T.C. Okar D.A. El-Maghrabi M.R. Newgard C.B. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24229-24236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to alter glycolytic and gluconeogenic flux. The purpose of this alteration was to be able to correlate changes in glycolysis to changes in Glu-6-Pase gene expression as was seen with high glucose. The effect of Fru-2,6-P2 concentration on the gene expression of other enzymes of the carbohydrate metabolism, namely Fru-1,6-P2ase, PEPCK, and L-PK, was also examined. Fao cells derived from a rat hepatoma cell line (17Deschatrette J. Weiss M.C. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1974; 56: 1603-11611Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) were maintained on RPMI 1640 media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS. Primary hepatocytes were prepared from fed Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (180–240 g) using the collagenase perfusion method (18Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3628) Google Scholar) and plated at a density of 3.5 × 106cells/60-mm Primaria culture dish (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) in 5 ml of modified Williams E media (Life Technologies, Inc., lacking glucose and methyl linoleate) supplemented with 10% FBS, 23 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 26 mm sodium bicarbonate, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 nmdexamethasone, 1 μm insulin, and 11 mmglucose. After 16–18 h, the cells were incubated for 4, 24, or 48 h with the medium described above but without FBS and containing either 5.5 or 27.5 mm glucose. During the 48 h incubation, the glucose concentration of the medium was monitored and the medium was changed at 24 h. After 24 h incubation, glucose concentration was always greater than 20 mm for cells incubated at a starting glucose concentration of 27.5 mm. Recombinant adenoviruses containing rat liver GK cDNA (AdCMV-GKL), rat hexokinase I cDNA (AdCMV-HKI), wild-type rat liver 6-PF-2-K/Fru-2,6-P2ase cDNA, wild-type (Ad-PF2KWT) or double mutant S32A/H258A (Ad-PF2KMut) were constructed as described previously (16Argaud D. Lange A.J. Becker T.C. Okar D.A. El-Maghrabi M.R. Newgard C.B. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24229-24236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Becker T.C.

Fao cells were transduced with stocks of either a control recombinant adenovirus lacking a cDNA insert (AdWT) or the recombinant adenoviruses AdCMV-GKL or AdCMV-HKI at a multiplicity of infection of 10 (10 plaque-forming units/cell) for 2 h. Under these conditions, the efficiency of adenovirus transduction is greater than 70% (16Argaud D. Lange A.J. Becker T.C. Okar D.A. El-Maghrabi M.R. Newgard C.B. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol.

These transduced cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and RPMI medium with 0.1% BSA and 27.5 mm glucose. The medium was changed every 24 h. Fao cells were also transduced with stocks of either a control recombinant adenovirus lacking a cDNA insert (AdWT) or Ad-PF2KWT or Ad-PF2KMut. These transduced cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and RPMI medium with 0.1% BSA. All recombinant adenoviruses were stored at a concentration of 1–5 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Total RNA was prepared from plated Fao cells or primary hepatocytes by extraction with Stat-60 (Tel-test, Friendswood, TX) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was denatured, electrophoresed, and transferred to a nylon membrane (GeneScreen, DuPont NEN) as described by Hod et al. (21Hod Y. Morris S.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

Radioactive signals were quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed with IP-Lab Analyst Software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). GK protein was extracted in homogenizing buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) and concentrated by precipitation with 65% saturated (NH4)2SO4. The precipitate was dissolved in homogenizing buffer containing 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Soluble protein (100 μg) was electrophoresed and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) for Western blot analysis as described previously (16Argaud D. Lange A.J. Becker T.C. Okar D.A. El-Maghrabi M.R. Newgard C.B. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24229-24236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The membrane was blotted with a 1:250 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against human pancreatic GK (Lampire Biological Laboratories, Pipersville, PA) and then with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Protein was visualized with a color reagent (Sigma). Protein levels were quantitated using a Personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed with IP-Lab Analyst Software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Crude extracts of Fao cells and primary hepatocytes were prepared as described above. The activities were analyzed in 12,000 × g supernatants. Hexokinase maximal activity was measured at 0.5 mm glucose. GK activity was calculated as the difference between the glucose phosphorylation capacities at 100 mm and 0.5 mm glucose (26Pilkis S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Glu-6-Pase activity was determined in Fao cell homogenates treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 at 20 mm Glu-6-P concentration (10Lange A.J. Argaud D. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pan W. Maitra S.R. Pilkis S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Glucose concentration and lactate production in the incubation medium were measured using standard enzymatic methods (27and Academic Press, Inc., LondonGoogle Scholar). Fru-2,6-P2 was extracted at 100 °C in 0.1 m NaOH and measured using the 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase assay (28Van Schaftingen E. Lederer B. Bartrons R. Hers H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Lactate and pyruvate concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically using standard enzymatic methods (27and Academic Press, Inc., LondonGoogle Scholar) in neutralized protein-free extracts as described previously by Argaud et al. (29Argaud D. Roth H. Wiernsperger N. Leverve X.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Incubating primary hepatocytes in a high glucose concentration (27.5 mm) increased the level of Glu-6-Pase mRNA 3-fold at 4 h, 9-fold at 24 h, and 20-fold at 48 h. However, in the presence of 5.5 mm glucose, Glu-6-Pase mRNA levels decreased from 4.2 ± 0.2 to 1 ± 0.1 (arbitrary units) during the first 24 h of incubation and remained constant for 48 h (Fig. 1). The stimulatory effect of glucose was seen despite the presence of 1 μm insulin in the incubation medium. The maximal stimulatory response of Glu-6-Pase mRNA was seen at glucose concentrations as low as 11 mm, and maximal stimulation was maintained at 27.5 mm glucose (Fig. 2). Although the medium was changed every 24 h, there was some lactate accumulation but without a significant change in medium pH. Since lactate production reached a maximum of 6 mm in 24 h (data not shown), we examined the effect of different concentrations of lactate on Glu-6-Pase mRNA in primary hepatocytes. A maximum 4-fold increase in Glu-6-Pase mRNA was obtained after 48 h incubation with 10 mm lactate (data not shown).Figure 2Quantification of stimulation of Glu-6-Pase mRNA by glucose in primary hepatocytes. RNA was extracted from 60-mm plates of primary hepatocytes, and 20 μg were used for quantification by Northern blot analysis. Primary hepatocytes were treated for 48 h with different glucose concentrations. Results are the means ± S.E. of 3 independent experiments. The quantity of RNA at 48 h for 5.5 mm of glucose was considered as 1 arbitrary unit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We compared the response of Glu-6-Pase mRNA in primary hepatocytes to that of L-PK, a well-characterized gene whose expression is stimulated by glucose (12Decaux J.-F. Antoine B. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11584-11590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the increase in L-PK mRNA in response to glucose in primary hepatocytes was smaller than that seen with Glu-6-Pase mRNA. L-PK mRNA levels increased by 10 ± 0.7-fold at 24 h and 12 ± 2.3-fold at 48 h. The maximal response of L-PK mRNA to glucose was attained at 24 h, whereas for Glu-6-Pase mRNA the response doubled between 24 and 48 h. To ascertain that the effects of glucose on Glu-6-Pase and L-PK mRNA were specific and not simply due to the cells being in a well-fed state, the expression of other gluconeogenic and glycolytic enzymes were measured and compared with values in low (5.5 mm) and high (27.5 mm) glucose as described above. The levels of Fru-1,6-Pase and 6-PF-2-K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA were increased slightly after 48 h incubation with high glucose, 3 ± 0.5-fold (Fig.1) and 2-fold (data not shown), respectively. The mRNA level of PEPCK was unaffected by glucose at 4 h but became undetectable by 24 h, regardless of glucose concentration (Fig. 1). GK mRNA was unaffected by glucose treatment (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that glucose specifically stimulates Glu-6-Pase and L-PK gene expression. As shown previously (9Argaud D. Zhang Q. Pan W. Maitra S. Pilkis S.J. Lange A.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lange A.J. Argaud D. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pan W. Maitra S.R. Pilkis S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In Fao cells, Glu-6-Pase levels at 27.5 mm glucose were increased 1.5-fold at 24 h and 3-fold at 48 h over Glu-6-Pase levels at 5.5 mm glucose (data not shown). To understand the difference in amplitude of the Glu-6-Pase mRNA response to glucose in primary hepatocytes versusFao cells, we explored the differences of these models with respect to glucose metabolism. As previously reported (16Argaud D. Lange A.J. Becker T.C. Okar D.A. El-Maghrabi M.R. Newgard C.B. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol.

The rate of lactate production from glucose was much lower in Fao cells than in primary hepatocytes (Table I, 0.27 ± 0.04 versus 23 ± 1 nmol/min/plate). The rate of lactate production in Fao cells was only slightly affected by glucose concentration, i.e. a 1.6-fold increase when glucose concentration was raised from 5.5 to 27.5 mm (Table I). In primary hepatocytes the rate of lactate production was increased 8-fold when the cells were incubated with 27.5 mm glucose compared with 5.5 mm (Table I) and at 27.5 mm glucose, 80% of the consumed glucose was metabolized to lactate (data not shown).Table ILactate production in Fao and primary hepatocytesCell typeTreatment5.5 mm Glc27.5 mm Glcnmol/min/platePrimary hepatocytesUntreated3 ± 0.323 ± 1FAOUntreated0.17 ± 0.020.27 ± 0.04AdWTND0.15 ± 0.04AdCMV-GKLND19 ± 1.8Lactate production was measured in the incubation medium as described under “Experimental Procedures” 72 h after transduction of the cells with AdWT or AdCMV-GKL.

The low glycolytic rate with glucose and the modest effect of glucose concentration on this rate in Fao cells led us to compare the level of GK activity in this cell line with primary hepatocytes. As shown in Table II, the level of GK activity in Fao cells was one-fifth that of primary hepatocytes, whereas HK activity was 11-fold higher in Fao cells than in primary hepatocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2131866220,"Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 is structurally and functionally similar to IRS-1. Indeed, stimulation with insulin or insulin-like growth factor I led to the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2, which in turn activated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in L6 cells and rat skeletal muscle. However, IRS-2 was rapidly dephosphorylated (3–10 min after the addition of insulin/insulin-like growth factor I), whereas IRS-1 phosphorylation continued for at least 60 min. The time courses of the PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 and IRS-2 paralleled the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins. Preincubation with sodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase, blocked the rapid dephosphorylation of IRS-2, suggesting the involvement of tyrosine phosphatase. The activation of PI 3-kinase apparently plays an important role in the rapid dephosphorylation of IRS-2, as IRS-2 dephosphorylation was inhibited markedly by suppressing PI 3-kinase activity with wortmannin or overexpression of the dominant negative p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, which cannot bind the p110 catalytic subunit. In addition, platelet-derived growth factor stimulation prior to insulin stimulation decreased IRS-associated PI 3-kinase and significantly inhibited the dephosphorylation of IRS-2. Taken together, these observations suggest that IRS-2 plays a unique role in mediating the signals from the insulin receptor to downstream molecules and that this effect is more transient than that of IRS-1. Tyrosine phosphatase and IRS-associated PI 3-kinase activity thus contribute to the rapid dephosphorylation of IRS-2."

Brown adipose tissue is the first form of adipose tissue to appear during development, and is present at birth in most species. The development of a leptin feedback system in early life and the relative role of the brown and white adipose tissues have not yet been revealed. We have investigated the expression of ob/leptin mRNA in brown adipose tissue around birth and with respect to feeding. Northern blotting analysis and in situ hybridization experiments demonstrated the presence of leptin mRNA in brown adipose tissue at 0, 18, and 24 h after birth. The leptin mRNA level was decreased at 8 h postpartum in fed animals and at 18 or 24 h in the absence of feeding. In addition, circulating leptin was detected in the plasma of newborn rats at 0, 10, or 24 h after birth, whereas it was not detectable in 10 h-old animals that did not suckle at their mother. The presence at birth of ob mRNA and circulating leptin, as well as the early effect of suckling on ob mRNA levels, suggests the precocious involvement of leptin in the control of food intake."

https://openalex.org/W2042240051,"Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have suggested an important role for DNA topoisomerases in regulating R-loop formation during transcription inEscherichia coli. In the present report we present genetic and biochemical evidence strongly suggesting that R-loop formation can occur during transcription of a portion of the rrnB operon and that it is regulated by DNA topoisomerase activity. We found that a multicopy plasmid (pBR322) carrying an heavily transcribed portion of the rrnB operon cannot be transformed in topAmutants unless RNase H is overproduced. Transcription of the 567-base pair HindIII fragment from the rrnB operon allows the extraction of large amount of R-looped plasmid DNAs from atopA mutant, in a manner that depends on the intracellular level of RNase H activity. When DNA gyrase is sufficiently active, hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNA is produced if the same DNA fragment is transcribed in a topA mutant. The formation of such topoisomers most likely reflect the presence of extensive R-loops since it is sensitive to the intracellular level of RNase H activity. Finally, the formation of R-looped plasmid DNAs in an in vitro transcription system using phage RNA polymerases is also detected when the 567-base pair HindIII fragment is transcribed on a negatively supercoiled DNA template.

Finally, the formation of R-looped plasmid DNAs in an in vitro transcription system using phage RNA polymerases is also detected when the 567-base pair HindIII fragment is transcribed on a negatively supercoiled DNA template. During the process of transcription, the nascent RNA molecule is normally displaced from the DNA template strand to be translated (mRNAs) or to participate in the process of translation (stable RNAs: tRNAs and rRNAs). Indeed, early results have suggested thatEscherichia coli RNA polymerase has a function allowing proper RNA displacement from the template strand (1Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, in some cases the RNA has to remain associated with the template strand to serve as a primer for DNA replication initiation. The best studied example in this regard is the replication origin of ColE1 plasmid DNA (2Itoh T. Tomizawa J.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2450-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 3Masukata H. Tomizawa J.-I. Cell. 1990; 62: 331-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, several observations suggest that R-loop formation can occur in a rather nonspecific manner if DNA gyrase, the enzyme responsible for the introduction of negative supercoiling into the DNA of bacteria, is present during transcription. In in vitroreplication systems for oriC containing plasmid DNAs and ColE1 plasmid derivatives and where RNA polymerase and DNA gyrase are present, RNase H and E. coli topoisomerase I, an enzyme that specifically relaxes negatively supercoiled DNA, are required to maintain the specificity in the process of initiation atoriC or at the ColE1 origin of replication, respectively (4Ogawa T. Pickett G.G. Kogoma T. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 5Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

This result is best explained by the introduction of negative supercoiling by DNA gyrase providing the driving force for R-loop formation at sites other than the normal origins of replication. The annealed RNAs can be used as primers to initiate replication at these sites. RNase H, an endoribonuclease degrading the RNA moiety of an RNA-DNA hybrid, eliminates these primers, whereas E. colitopoisomerase I by counteracting DNA gyrase activity, prevents their formation or destabilizes them. Recent in vitro experiments have shown that the production of hypernegatively supercoiled DNA during transcription in the presence of DNA gyrase was due to R-loop formation (7Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Many plasmid DNAs tested in this system were shown to become hypernegatively supercoiled during transcription in the presence of DNA gyrase but in the absence of RNase H, suggesting that extensive R-loop formation was a rather general phenomenon in the presence of DNA gyrase (7Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, E. coli DNA topoisomerase I was shown to efficiently abolish the formation of such supercoiled DNA during transcription, and hence R-looping as well. A model for the regulation of R-loop formation was therefore proposed in which DNA gyrase, with its supercoiling activity, favors the formation of R-loops, while DNA topoisomerase I, by relaxing negative supercoiling, inhibits the formation of such structures. In support of this model, it has been recently demonstrated that an R-loop can be a hot spot for DNA relaxation by E. coli DNA topoisomerase I (8Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).To study the putative role of DNA topoisomerase I in the regulation of R-loop formation in vivo, it was necessary to construct newtopA mutants. The reason is that to survive, topAmutants need to acquire compensatory mutations that most often lie in agyr gene and as a result, lower DNA gyrase activity. Moreover, some of these strains such as the widely used DM800 with thegyrB225 mutation, has one or more additional compensatory mutation(s) (9DiNardo S. Voelkel K.A. Sternglanz R. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. Cell. 1982; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Since these mutations arise to compensate for the absence of DNA topoisomerase I, they will most likely mask some of the effects associated with the loss of topA gene function. Various topA mutants with a conditional compensatory phenotype were thus constructed (10Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These strains have agyrB(Ts) mutation and as a result, they can grow at 37 °C because gyrase activity is then low enough to compensate for the loss of topA. At 30 °C, they basically do not grow because gyrase regains a more wild-type level of activity that can no longer compensate for the absence of DNA topoisomerase I. Such strains are therefore cold-sensitive and are also temperature-sensitive (Ts) because of the presence of the gyrB(Ts) allele. By exposing these strains to the non-permissive cold temperature it is thus possible to study the true effects of loosing topA on cell physiology. Since RNase H overproduction allowed these mutants to grow at low temperature, it was concluded that R-loop formation was a major problem for the cell in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I. Moreover, a combination of topA and rnhA (encoding for RNase HI) mutations was found to be non-viable and the gyrB(Ts) mutation was shown to correct some phenotypes associated with anrnhA mutation at 37 °C. It was thus suggested thatgyr mutations arise in topA mutants to reduce R-loop formation (10Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These in vivo data are therefore in perfect agreement with the in vitro results and suggest an important role for DNA topoisomerases, and hence DNA supercoiling, in the regulation of R-loop formation. In view of the important roles of these enzymes in the regulation of DNA functions, it is thus interesting to consider the R-loop structure as a putative regulator of various genomic activities. However, this model needs to be supported by data showing that R-loop formation indeed occurs during transcription of certain genes in E. coli and that it is regulated by DNA topoisomerase activity. In the present report we present genetic and biochemical evidence that R-loop formation can occur during transcription of an rrn operon both in vivo and in vitro and that it is influenced by DNA topoisomerase activity.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have provided genetic and biochemical evidence that R-loop formation can occur during transcription of therrnB operon in E. coli. We first showed that heavy transcription of a portion of the rrnB operon was detrimental for the growth of all topA mutants tested unless RNase H was overproduced. We then demonstrated the formation of conformers when the 567-bp rrnB HindIII fragment was transcribed on a plasmid (pMD306) and in a topA mutant, suggesting the presence of R-loops on the plasmid DNAs. Indeed, the disappearance of such conformers upon RNase H treatment confirmed the presence of R-loops. Following these results it was important to show that these R-loops were generated during transcription in vivo and therefore, that their formation was not induced during plasmid DNAs extraction. Two sets of experiments strongly suggested that these R-loops were generated during in vivotranscription. First, we found that overproducing RNase H in vivo considerably decreased the amount of conformers produced. Second, when DNA gyrase was sufficiently active we were able to detect the presence of hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNAs, a predictable event if extensive R-loop formation occurs. This was indeed supported by the finding that the formation of such topoisomers was sensitive to the intracellular level of RNase H. The in vivo evidence for R-loop formation during transcription of the rrnB HindIII fragment is also supported by the results of in vitrotranscription experiments: the formation of RNase H-sensitive conformers (this study) and the formation of hypernegatively supercoiled DNA in the presence of DNA gyrase and in a manner sensitive to the level of RNase H activity (8Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).A larger amount of conformers, and therefore R-loops, was always detected when the rrnB HindIII fragment was transcribed, either in vivo or in vitro, in its physiological orientation as compared with its reverse orientation. Similar results were recently obtained by measuring the R-loop-dependent linking number change following the addition of DNA gyrase either during or after transcription (8Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The results of such experiments allowed us to conclude that roughly the same amount of R-loops were generated in both orientations under the experimental conditions used, but that the R-loops generated in the physiological orientation were more stable than the ones generated in the reverse orientation. This conclusion regarding the stability was based on the sensitivity of the R-loops to RNase A, a ribonuclease specific to single-stranded RNA. By considering this stability factor, the absence of conformers when therrnB HindIII fragment was transcribed in its reverse orientation (pMD308) at 35 °C may be explained by a combination ofin vitro and in vivo factors. It is possible that the unstable R-loops were lost during the extraction of plasmid DNAs and/or that their RNA was degraded by RNase A before loading the samples on the agarose gels. It is predictable and it has indeed been shown that R-loops are generally less stable on relaxed DNA than on negatively supercoiled DNA (1Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this context one can imagine that the absence of conformers on pMD308 extracted from cells grown at 35 °C is due to the fact that the negative supercoiling level was too low (lower than in a wild-type cell; data not shown), whereas the presence of such conformers when the same plasmid was extracted from cells grown at 30 °C is explained by a higher negative supercoiling level which can stabilize the R-loops. Because the R-loops that are produced when the rrnB HindIII fragment is transcribed in its physiological orientation tend to be more stable, they will be less affected by the supercoiling level. This would explain why large amounts of conformers were detected on pMD306 extracted from cells grown at both temperatures (30 and 35 °C). By considering the supercoiling factor as a key element in R-loop formation one can explain why a mutation reducing the level of negative supercoiling, such as a mutation in gyrA or gyrB, will be the best mutation to compensate for the absence of DNA topoisomerase I, since such a mutation will prevent stable R-loop formation. Indeed, R-loop formation was not detected when the rrnB HindIII fragment was transcribed in its physiological orientation on a relaxed DNA template in vitro. Moreover, by exposing the cold-sensitive topA mutant to a temperature higher than 37.5 °C, no R-loops were detected on pMD306 DNA which was also found to be significantly more relaxed than DNA extracted from wild-type cells (data not shown). Therefore, as concluded from the results ofin vitro experiments (8Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), our in vivo results allow us to suggest that DNA gyrase participates both in R-loop initiation and R-loop elongation by providing the negative superhelical density needed for these processes.Our results also suggest that the nucleotide sequence of the DNA template can contribute to the stability of the R-loop. What sequence element is responsible for the higher stability of the R-loop generated during transcription of the HindIII rrnB fragment in its physiological orientation, is unknown for the moment. Interestingly, it has been shown that a RNA-DNA hybrid with a purine RNA is more stable than a hybrid with a pyrimidine RNA (25Roberts R.W. Crothers D.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1463-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In addition, recent results of in vitro experiments have shown that long polypurine stretches can favor the formation of very stable RNA-DNA hybrids if transcription occurs in the direction that makes purine-rich RNA (26Reaban M.E. Lebowitz J. Griffin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21850-21857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Grabczyk E. Fishman M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1791-1797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We note that the RNA made when the rrnB HindIII fragment is transcribed in its physiological orientation is more purine-rich than the RNA made when it is transcribed in its reverse orientation. Whether it is significant or not remains to be determined. It is also important to mention that transcription of other DNA fragments from the rrnB operon and from other sources was recently found to have a detrimental effect on the growth oftopA mutants in a manner that depends on the intracellular level of RNase H. 4E. Massé and M. Drolet, unpublished results. We therefore believe that the major factor influencing R-loop formation in general is the supercoiling level of the DNA template but that the nucleotide sequence of the DNA template is also an important factor.Interestingly, in all other in vitro systems where R-loop formation has been demonstrated, the primary role (probably the only one) of the transcribed RNA is to form an hybrid with the template DNA strand. Obviously, this is not the case in the present study since the role of the rrnB operon is to produce rRNAs and tRNAs. In the other described systems RNA-DNA hybrids are formed either to create RNA primers to initiate DNA replication (2Itoh T. Tomizawa J.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2450-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 28Xu B. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), or possibly to be used as a recombination intermediate in the process of immunoglobulin class switching (26Reaban M.E. Lebowitz J. Griffin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21850-21857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Daniels G.A. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5006-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore, a major question is whether or not R-loop formation at rrnB is biologically significant. To be biologically meaningful, R-loop formation during transcription of therrnB operon must occur in wild-type cells. We have found that pNO1302 DNA is not easily maintained in wild-type cells unless RNase H is overproduced. In addition, pNO1302 but not the pEM501 derivative without rrnB promoters, was found to contain R-loops when extracted from wild-type cells.4 These results suggest that even in the presence of negative regulators such as DNA topoisomerase I and RNase H, R-loop formation can occur whenrrnB transcription increases considerably. This is an indication that the system regulating R-loop formation can be saturated in wild-type cells and therefore, that such structures may form in these cells. Moreover, to be biologically relevant, R-loop formation does not have to be frequent especially when one considers the possible involvement of such structures in initiation of DNA replication and DNA recombination. Interestingly, in the case of the cold-sensitivetopA mutants, we repeatedly observe a 10–20-fold increase in the gene duplication rate between different rrn operons as compared with the rate in an isogenic gyrB(Ts) strain. 5E. Massé, M.-A. Raymond, and M. Drolet, unpublished results. Whether R-loop formation during transcription of rrn operons is directly or indirectly involved in gene duplication remains to be tested. It is worth mentioning that the absence of either type I DNA topoisomerase (Top1 or Top3) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in increased recombination in the rDNA multiple tandem array (30Christman M.F. Dietrich F.S. Fink G.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 413-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 31Levin N.A. Bjornsti M.A. Fink G.R. Genetics. 1993; 133: 799-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The possible involvement of R-loop formation in this process has not yet been investigated. During the process of transcription, the nascent RNA molecule is normally displaced from the DNA template strand to be translated (mRNAs) or to participate in the process of translation (stable RNAs: tRNAs and rRNAs). Indeed, early results have suggested thatEscherichia coli RNA polymerase has a function allowing proper RNA displacement from the template strand (1Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, in some cases the RNA has to remain associated with the template strand to serve as a primer for DNA replication initiation. The best studied example in this regard is the replication origin of ColE1 plasmid DNA (2Itoh T. Tomizawa J.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2450-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 3Masukata H. Tomizawa J.-I. Cell. 1990; 62: 331-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, several observations suggest that R-loop formation can occur in a rather nonspecific manner if DNA gyrase, the enzyme responsible for the introduction of negative supercoiling into the DNA of bacteria, is present during transcription. In in vitroreplication systems for oriC containing plasmid DNAs and ColE1 plasmid derivatives and where RNA polymerase and DNA gyrase are present, RNase H and E. coli topoisomerase I, an enzyme that specifically relaxes negatively supercoiled DNA, are required to maintain the specificity in the process of initiation atoriC or at the ColE1 origin of replication, respectively (4Ogawa T. Pickett G.G. Kogoma T. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 5Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8578-8583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Minden J.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9316-9325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result is best explained by the introduction of negative supercoiling by DNA gyrase providing the driving force for R-loop formation at sites other than the normal origins of replication. The annealed RNAs can be used as primers to initiate replication at these sites. RNase H, an endoribonuclease degrading the RNA moiety of an RNA-DNA hybrid, eliminates these primers, whereas E. colitopoisomerase I by counteracting DNA gyrase activity, prevents their formation or destabilizes them. Recent in vitro experiments have shown that the production of hypernegatively supercoiled DNA during transcription in the presence of DNA gyrase was due to R-loop formation (7Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Many plasmid DNAs tested in this system were shown to become hypernegatively supercoiled during transcription in the presence of DNA gyrase but in the absence of RNase H, suggesting that extensive R-loop formation was a rather general phenomenon in the presence of DNA gyrase (7Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, E. coli DNA topoisomerase I was shown to efficiently abolish the formation of such supercoiled DNA during transcription, and hence R-looping as well. A model for the regulation of R-loop formation was therefore proposed in which DNA gyrase, with its supercoiling activity, favors the formation of R-loops, while DNA topoisomerase I, by relaxing negative supercoiling, inhibits the formation of such structures. In support of this model, it has been recently demonstrated that an R-loop can be a hot spot for DNA relaxation by E. coli DNA topoisomerase I (8Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To study the putative role of DNA topoisomerase I in the regulation of R-loop formation in vivo, it was necessary to construct newtopA mutants. The reason is that to survive, topAmutants need to acquire compensatory mutations that most often lie in agyr gene and as a result, lower DNA gyrase activity. Moreover, some of these strains such as the widely used DM800 with thegyrB225 mutation, has one or more additional compensatory mutation(s) (9DiNardo S. Voelkel K.A. Sternglanz R. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. Cell. 1982; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Since these mutations arise to compensate for the absence of DNA topoisomerase I, they will most likely mask some of the effects associated with the loss of topA gene function. Various topA mutants with a conditional compensatory phenotype were thus constructed (10Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These strains have agyrB(Ts) mutation and as a result, they can grow at 37 °C because gyrase activity is then low enough to compensate for the loss of topA. At 30 °C, they basically do not grow because gyrase regains a more wild-type level of activity that can no longer compensate for the absence of DNA topoisomerase I. Such strains are therefore cold-sensitive and are also temperature-sensitive (Ts) because of the presence of the gyrB(Ts) allele. By exposing these strains to the non-permissive cold temperature it is thus possible to study the true effects of loosing topA on cell physiology. Since RNase H overproduction allowed these mutants to grow at low temperature, it was concluded that R-loop formation was a major problem for the cell in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I. Moreover, a combination of topA and rnhA (encoding for RNase HI) mutations was found to be non-viable and the gyrB(Ts) mutation was shown to correct some phenotypes associated with anrnhA mutation at 37 °C. It was thus suggested thatgyr mutations arise in topA mutants to reduce R-loop formation (10Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These in vivo data are therefore in perfect agreement with the in vitro results and suggest an important role for DNA topoisomerases, and hence DNA supercoiling, in the regulation of R-loop formation. In view of the important roles of these enzymes in the regulation of DNA functions, it is thus interesting to consider the R-loop structure as a putative regulator of various genomic activities. However, this model needs to be supported by data showing that R-loop formation indeed occurs during transcription of certain genes in E. coli and that it is regulated by DNA topoisomerase activity. In the present report we present genetic and biochemical evidence that R-loop formation can occur during transcription of an rrn operon both in vivo and in vitro and that it is influenced by DNA topoisomerase activity. DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have provided genetic and biochemical evidence that R-loop formation can occur during transcription of therrnB operon in E. coli. We first showed that heavy transcription of a portion of the rrnB operon was detrimental for the growth of all topA mutants tested unless RNase H was overproduced. We then demonstrated the formation of conformers when the 567-bp rrnB HindIII fragment was transcribed on a plasmid (pMD306) and in a topA mutant, suggesting the presence of R-loops on the plasmid DNAs. Indeed, the disappearance of such conformers upon RNase H treatment confirmed the presence of R-loops. Following these results it was important to show that these R-loops were generated during transcription in vivo and therefore, that their formation was not induced during plasmid DNAs extraction. Two sets of experiments strongly suggested that these R-loops were generated during in vivotranscription. First, we found that overproducing RNase H in vivo considerably decreased the amount of conformers produced. Second, when DNA gyrase was sufficiently active we were able to detect the presence of hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNAs, a predictable event if extensive R-loop formation occurs. This was indeed supported by the finding that the formation of such topoisomers was sensitive to the intracellular level of RNase H. The in vivo evidence for R-loop formation during transcription of the rrnB HindIII fragment is also supported by the results of in vitrotranscription experiments: the formation of RNase H-sensitive conformers (this study) and the formation of hypernegatively supercoiled DNA in the presence of DNA gyrase and in a manner sensitive to the level of RNase H activity (8Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).A larger amount of conformers, and therefore R-loops, was always detected when the rrnB HindIII fragment was transcribed, either in vivo or in vitro, in its physiological orientation as compared with its reverse orientation. Similar results were recently obtained by measuring the R-loop-dependent linking number change following the addition of DNA gyrase either during or after transcription (8Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The results of such experiments allowed us to conclude that roughly the same amount of R-loops were generated in both orientations under the experimental conditions used, but that the R-loops generated in the physiological orientation were more stable than the ones generated in the reverse orientation. This conclusion regarding the stability was based on the sensitivity of the R-loops to RNase A, a ribonuclease specific to single-stranded RNA. By considering this stability factor, the absence of conformers when therrnB HindIII fragment was transcribed in its reverse orientation (pMD308) at 35 °C may be explained by a combination ofin vitro and in vivo factors. It is possible that the unstable R-loops were lost during the extraction of plasmid DNAs and/or that their RNA was degraded by RNase A before loading the samples on the agarose gels. It is predictable and it has indeed been shown that R-loops are generally less stable on relaxed DNA than on negatively supercoiled DNA (1Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this context one can imagine that the absence of conformers on pMD308 extracted from cells grown at 35 °C is due to the fact that the negative supercoiling level was too low (lower than in a wild-type cell; data not shown), whereas the presence of such conformers when the same plasmid was extracted from cells grown at 30 °C is explained by a higher negative supercoiling level which can stabilize the R-loops. Because the R-loops that are produced when the rrnB HindIII fragment is transcribed in its physiological orientation tend to be more stable, they will be less affected by the supercoiling level. This would explain why large amounts of conformers were detected on pMD306 extracted from cells grown at both temperatures (30 and 35 °C). By considering the supercoiling factor as a key element in R-loop formation one can explain why a mutation reducing the level of negative supercoiling, such as a mutation in gyrA or gyrB, will be the best mutation to compensate for the absence of DNA topoisomerase I, since such a mutation will prevent stable R-loop formation. Indeed, R-loop formation was not detected when the rrnB HindIII fragment was transcribed in its physiological orientation on a relaxed DNA template in vitro. Moreover, by exposing the cold-sensitive topA mutant to a temperature higher than 37.5 °C, no R-loops were detected on pMD306 DNA which was also found to be significantly more relaxed than DNA extracted from wild-type cells (data not shown). Therefore, as concluded from the results ofin vitro experiments (8Phoenix P. Raymond M.-A. Massé E. Drolet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), our in vivo results allow us to suggest that DNA gyrase participates both in R-loop initiation and R-loop elongation by providing the negative superhelical density needed for these processes.Our results also suggest that the nucleotide sequence of the DNA template can contribute to the stability of the R-loop. What sequence element is responsible for the higher stability of the R-loop generated during transcription of the HindIII rrnB fragment in its physiological orientation, is unknown for the moment. Interestingly, it has been shown that a RNA-DNA hybrid with a purine RNA is more stable than a hybrid with a pyrimidine RNA (25Roberts R.W. Crothers D.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1463-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In addition, recent results of in vitro experiments have shown that long polypurine stretches can favor the formation of very stable RNA-DNA hybrids if transcription occurs in the direction that makes purine-rich RNA (26Reaban M.E. Lebowitz J. Griffin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21850-21857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Grabczyk E. Fishman M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1791-1797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We note that the RNA made when the rrnB HindIII fragment is transcribed in its physiological orientation is more purine-rich than the RNA made when it is transcribed in its reverse orientation. Whether it is significant or not remains to be determined. It is also important to mention that transcription of other DNA fragments from the rrnB operon and from other sources was recently found to have a detrimental effect on the growth oftopA mutants in a manner that depends on the intracellular level of RNase H. 4E. Massé and M. Drolet, unpublished results. We therefore believe that the major factor influencing R-loop formation in general is the supercoiling level of the DNA template but that the nucleotide sequence of the DNA template is also an important factor.Interestingly, in all other in vitro systems where R-loop formation has been demonstrated, the primary role (probably the only one) of the transcribed RNA is to form an hybrid with the template DNA strand. Obviously, this is not the case in the present study since the role of the rrnB operon is to produce rRNAs and tRNAs. In the other described systems RNA-DNA hybrids are formed either to create RNA primers to initiate DNA replication (2Itoh T. Tomizawa J.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2450-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 28Xu B. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), or possibly to be used as a recombination intermediate in the process of immunoglobulin class switching (26Reaban M.E. Lebowitz J. Griffin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21850-21857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Daniels G.A. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5006-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore, a major question is whether or not R-loop formation at rrnB is biologically significant. To be biologically meaningful, R-loop formation during transcription of therrnB operon must occur in wild-type cells. We have found that pNO1302 DNA is not easily maintained in wild-type cells unless RNase H is overproduced. In addition, pNO1302 but not the pEM501 derivative without rrnB promoters, was found to contain R-loops when extracted from wild-type cells.4 These results suggest that even in the presence of negative regulators such as DNA topoisomerase I and RNase H, R-loop formation can occur whenrrnB transcription increases considerably. This is an indication that the system regulating R-loop formation can be saturated in wild-type cells and therefore, that such structures may form in these cells. Moreover, to be biologically relevant, R-loop formation does not have to be frequent especially when one considers the possible involvement of such structures in initiation of DNA replication and DNA recombination. Interestingly, in the case of the cold-sensitivetopA mutants, we repeatedly observe a 10–20-fold increase in the gene duplication rate between different rrn operons as compared with the rate in an isogenic gyrB(Ts) strain. 5E. Massé, M.-A. Raymond, and M. Drolet, unpublished results. Whether R-loop formation during transcription of rrn operons is directly or indirectly involved in gene duplication remains to be tested. It is worth mentioning that the absence of either type I DNA topoisomerase (Top1 or Top3) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in increased recombination in the rDNA multiple tandem array (30Christman M.F. Dietrich F.S. Fink G.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 413-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 31Levin N.A. Bjornsti M.A. Fink G.R.

https://openalex.org/W2024184251,"While transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) type III receptor (RIII) is known to increase TGFβ1binding to its type II receptor (RII), the significance of this phenomenon is not known. We used human breast cancer MCF-7 cells to study the role of RIII in regulating autocrine TGFβ1activity because they express very little RIII and no detectable autocrine TGFβ activity. A tetracycline-repressible RIII expression vector was stably transfected into this cell line. Expression of RIII increased TGFβ1 binding to TGFβ type I receptor (RI) as well as RII. Treatment with tetracycline suppressed RIII expression and abolished TGFβ1 binding to RI and RII. Growth of RIII-transfected cells was reduced by 40% when plated at low density on plastic. This reduction was reversed by tetracycline treatment and was partially reversed by treatment with a TGFβ1neutralizing antibody. The activity of a TGFβ-responsive promoter construct when transiently transfected was more than 3-fold higher in the RIII-transfected cells than in the control cells. Treating the cells with tetracycline or the TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody also significantly attenuated the increased promoter activity. These results suggest that expression of RIII restored autocrine TGFβ1 activity in MCF-7 cells. The RIII-transfected cells were also much less clonogenic in soft agarose than the control cells indicating a reversion of progression. Thus, RIII may be essential for an optimal level of the autocrine TGFβ activity in some cells, especially in the transformed cells with reduced RII expression. While transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) type III receptor (RIII) is known to increase TGFβ1binding to its type II receptor (RII), the significance of this phenomenon is not known. We used human breast cancer MCF-7 cells to study the role of RIII in regulating autocrine TGFβ1activity because they express very little RIII and no detectable autocrine TGFβ activity. A tetracycline-repressible RIII expression vector was stably transfected into this cell line. Expression of RIII increased TGFβ1 binding to TGFβ type I receptor (RI) as well as RII. Treatment with tetracycline suppressed RIII expression and abolished TGFβ1 binding to RI and RII. Growth of RIII-transfected cells was reduced by 40% when plated at low density on plastic. This reduction was reversed by tetracycline treatment and was partially reversed by treatment with a TGFβ1neutralizing antibody. The activity of a TGFβ-responsive promoter construct when transiently transfected was more than 3-fold higher in the RIII-transfected cells than in the control cells. Treating the cells with tetracycline or the TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody also significantly attenuated the increased promoter activity. These results suggest that expression of RIII restored autocrine TGFβ1 activity in MCF-7 cells. The RIII-transfected cells were also much less clonogenic in soft agarose than the control cells indicating a reversion of progression. Thus, RIII may be essential for an optimal level of the autocrine TGFβ activity in some cells, especially in the transformed cells with reduced RII expression.

They are multifunctional growth factors involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, extracellular matrix formation, and immune response (1Moses H.L. Yang E.Y. Pietenpol J.A.

Many studies have shown that TGFβ can inhibit the growth of a variety cell types including epithelial, endothelial, lymphoid, and myeloid cells (4Lyons R.M. Moses H.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Almost all types of cells express one or more of the three isoforms identified in mammals. Although in most systems, the majority of TGFβs secreted is in a latent form with no biological activity, a small percentage can be detected as mature, active TGFβs which may act to regulate cellular functions in an autocrine fashion. For example, neutralization of endogenous TGFβs with anti-TGFβ antibodies was shown to stimulate proliferation of breast and colon cancer cells (5Arteaga C.L. Coffey Jr., R.J. Dugger T.C.

Repression of TGFβ expression by TGFβ1 antisense RNA in colon cancer cells was shown to increase clonogenicity in soft agarose and tumorigenicity in nude mice indicating that autocrine TGFβ activity is tumor-suppressive (8Wu S.P.

TGFβs elicit their effects by binding mainly to three cell surface proteins termed type I (RI), type II (RII), and type III (RIII) receptors. RI and RII are serine/threonine kinase receptors of 55 and 75 kDa, respectively, that form heteromeric complex, apparently at one to one stoichiometric ratio and necessary for TGFβ signal transduction (3Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Lopez-Casillas F. Massague J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It has been shown that RI requires RII for TGFβ binding, whereas RII needs RI for signaling (10Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J.

Recently, several studies showed that mutation or down-regulated expression of RI and/or RII is associated with loss of TGFβ sensitivity and progression of human gastric, colorectal, and prostate cancers and T-cell lymphomas (12Park K.

These results again indicate that autocrine TGFβs can act as negative growth regulators and disruption of the autocrine TGFβ loop is probably a major event contributing to malignant progression. TGFβ RIII, also called β-glycan, is a proteoglycan of 280–330 kDa. It is the most abundant TGFβ binding molecule on the cell surface of a variety of cell types (21Cheifetz S. Bassols A. Stanley K. Ohta M. Greenberger J. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10783-10789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Segarini P.R. Rosen D.M. Seyedin S.M. Mol.

Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses indicate that human RIII has a relatively small cytoplasmic domain of 41 amino acid residues that contains no consensus signaling motif (23Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massague J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 24Wang X.F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is believed not to directly transduce TGFβ signal. However, RIII binds all three TGFβ isoforms with high affinity. TheK d ranges from 50 to 300 pm depending on cell types (21Cheifetz S. Bassols A. Stanley K. Ohta M. Greenberger J. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10783-10789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cheifetz S. Hernandez H. Laiho M. ten Dijke P. Iwata K.K. Massague J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23282-23287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of RIII in the cells that lacks RIII significantly increased TGFβ1 binding to RII by 2.5-fold or more (24Wang X.F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 27Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). It was shown that in the absence of RIII, only a small population of RII in myoblasts could bind TGFβ1 with high affinity, while a larger population of RII had a much lower affinity for TGFβ1. However, expression of RIII converted all RII receptors into one population with high affinity for TGFβ1 (27Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). In the presence of ligands, RIII has been shown to form a heteromeric complex with RII suggesting that RIII enhances TGFβ binding to RII by directly presenting the ligands to RII (27Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 28Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Henis Y.I. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22215-22218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While it is clear that RIII can enhance TGFβ1 binding to RII, the significance of this phenomenon remains to be elucidated. Since TGFβ isoforms are produced mainly in a latent form and mature, activated TGFβ levels are very low, if detectable, in most cell types, the majority of RII receptors with low affinity would probably not be occupied by the ligands in the absence of RIII. On the basis of what is known about the stoichiometric interaction between TGFβ RI and RII, it appears that RIII should enhance autocrine TGFβ1 activity if a cell expresses a similar or lower level of RII than RI. Under this condition, autocrine TGFβ activity is minimized without RIII because only a small percentage of RII is ligand-bound and can activate a small percentage of RI to transduce the signal. Thus, expression of RIII should increase the percentage of ligand-bound RII and consequently the percentage of activated RI. To test this hypothesis, we expressed RIII in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells which express a very low level of RII with no detectable autocrine TGFβ activity. We show that expression of RIII inhibited both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7 cells and the inhibition could be reversed partially by a TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody, indicating that RIII-induced growth inhibition is at least partially due to restored autocrine negative activity of TGFβ1. MCF-7 cells were originally obtained from the Michigan Cancer Foundation. The cell line was adapted to McCoy's 5A medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), pyruvate, vitamins, amino acids, and antibiotics (29Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Working cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and routinely checked for mycoplasma contamination. MCF-7 limiting dilution clones were obtained by plating parental cells into 96-well culture plates at 0.5 cell/well. The full-length cDNA of rat TGFβ RIII (24Wang X.F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) was subcloned by blunt-ended ligation into a tetracycline-repressible expression system as described previously (20Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sense orientation of the RIII cDNA was confirmed by restriction digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. The expression vectors were linearized and transfected into one of MCF-7 limiting dilution clones with a BTX Electro Cell Manipulator at 250 V and 950 microfarads. The control cells were transfected with the empty vectors. The transfected cells were plated in 10-cm culture plates and maintained in the 10% FBS medium for 2 days. Selection of stable transfectants were accomplished by adding Geneticin (G418 sulfate; Life Technologies, Inc.) to the culture medium at 600 μg/ml. G418-resistant clones were ring-cloned and expanded for screening of RIII expression. Control clones were pooled and designated as Neo cell. Total RNA from G418-resistant cells was isolated by guanidine thiocyanate homogenization and acidic phenol extraction (30Xie W.Q. Rothblum L.I. Biotechniques. 1991; 11 (, 326–327): 324PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the transfected rat RIII mRNA levels in the clones, we constructed a rat RIII riboprobe by inserting a 470-base pair BamHI fragment of the rat RIII cDNA into pBSK(−) plasmid (Stratagene Cloning Systems). The recombinant plasmid was then linearized with EcoRI and T3 RNA polymerase was used to synthesize a radioactive antisense RIII probe. RNase protection assays were performed using this radioactive antisense riboprobe to measure RIII mRNA levels in the transfected clones as described previously (20Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Simian recombinant TGFβ1 was purified from conditioned media of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells as described previously (31Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Purified TGFβ1 was iodinated by the chloramine T method as described by Ruff and Rizzino (32Ruff E. Rizzino A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To measure the expression of cell surface TGFβ receptors, [125I]TGFβ1 (200 pm) was incubated with a cell monolayer in 35-mm tissue culture wells and then cross-linked to its receptors as described by Segarini et al. (33Segarini P.R. Roberts A.B. Rosen D.M. Seyedin S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14655-14662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled cell monolayers were solubilized in 200 μl of 1% Triton X-100 containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Equal amounts of cell lysate protein were electrophoresed in 4–10% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and exposed for autoradiography. To measure the amount of active TGFβ1 in the media conditioned by control or RIII-transfected cells, monolayer cells in 6-well culture plates were cultured in the 10% FBS medium until confluence. The cells were washed twice with a serum-free McCoy's 5A medium and incubated in 1.5 ml of this serum-free medium for additional 72 h. The conditioned medium was then collected in siliconized microcentrifuge tubes and the cell number was counted with a hemocytometer. The amount of mature, activated TGFβ1 in the conditioned medium was determined with a TGFβ1 ELISA kit from Promega (Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To study the effect of RIII expression on cell proliferation at low seeding densities, the control and RIII-transfected cells were plated at 200 or 400 cells per well in 24-well culture plates. After 9 days of incubation, relative cell number was determined with an MTT assay as described previously (20Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether autocrine TGFβ1 activity was enhanced after RIII expression, a TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody (R&D Systems) was added to the cells after plating at a final concentration of 30 μg/ml. To determine whether RIII expression enhanced autocrine TGFβ1activity, we measured a TGFβ-responsive promoter activity using a plasmid called p3TP-Lux from Dr. J. Massague. The promoter activity is reported by luciferase (10Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). The p3TP-Lux (20 μg) and a β-galactosidase expression plasmid (5 μg) were transiently co-transfected into the MCF-7 Neo control or RIII-expressing cells (107 cells) by electroporation in the same manner as the stable transfection described above. The cells were then equally divided into replicate culture dishes, part of which were treated with tetracycline (0.1 μg/ml) or the TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody (30 μg/ml) for 48 h. The treated and control cells were lysed in luciferase buffer (100 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol) using three cycles of freeze-thaw. The activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase in the cell extract were assayed using published procedures (34Schmidt J.V. Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22203-22209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity and expressed as relative luciferase activity. To compare the clonogenic potential of the control and RIII-transfected cells in a semisolid medium, soft agarose assays were performed as described previously (20Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 × 103 cells were suspended in 1 ml of 0.4% low melting point agarose (Life Technologies) dissolved in the 10% FBS medium and plated on the top of a 1-ml underlayer of 0.8% agarose in the same medium in 6-well culture plates. For tetracycline treatment, we added tetracycline in soft agarose at 0.1 μg/ml as well as 200 μl of the medium containing 0.2 μg/ml tetracycline on the top of the solidified agarose. Control wells received 200 μl of the medium without tetracycline. The media were replenished every 3 days. After 3 weeks of incubation in the humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C, the cell colonies were visualized by staining with 1 ml of p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet staining (Sigma). To quantitate the clonogenicity, the colonies in each well were counted under a magnifying lens. MCF-7 cells express very low levels of RIII and undetectable RII on the cell surface using the receptor cross-linking method (20Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, they express low levels of RII mRNA and their growth can be slightly inhibited by high concentrations of exogenous TGFβ1 suggesting that they do have functional TGFβ receptors and intracellular signaling components (20Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, this cell line expresses mainly TGFβ1with no detectable TGFβ2 and TGFβ3(36Arrick B.A. Korc M. Derynck R. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 299-303PubMed Google Scholar). 2C. Chen and L.-Z. Sun, unpublished observations. Therefore, this cell line is ideal for the examination of whether TGFβ RIII plays a role in regulating autocrine TGFβ1 activity and, consequently, cell growth. Tetracycline-repressible RIII expression vectors were transfected into one of the MCF-7 limiting dilution clones. Using RNase protection assays and a rat RIII riboprobe, we identified two RIII-expressing clones. Both clones showed similar levels of RIII expression and growth properties on plastic and in soft agarose (data not shown). Therefore, we used one clone for the study. The mRNA level of the transfected RIII in this clone, designated as RIII cell, is shown in Fig.1. Consistent with the mRNA level, RIII cells also expressed a higher level of cell surface RIII protein than the Neo cells by the receptor cross-linking assay (Fig. 2). The specificity of [125I]TGFβ1 binding to the receptor was confirmed by competition with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled TGFβ1 (Fig. 2, third lane). Treatment with tetracycline at 0.1 μg/ml for 4 days prior to the receptor cross-linking assay almost completely suppressed the expression of transfected RIII (Fig. 2, fourth lane). This reversible expression of RIII by tetracycline was particularly useful in the subsequent experiments for the demonstration of the specific effect of the RIII on the cell growth and autocrine TGFβ activity.Figure 2Cell surface expression of TGFβ receptors in the MCF-7 transfectants. Receptor cross-linking assays were used to examine the cell surface profiles of the TGFβ receptors in the Neo and RIII cells. Confluent monolayer cultures of the Neo and RIII cells were incubated with 200 pm125I-TGFβ1 alone (first andsecond lanes) or in the presence of 20 nm cold TGFβ1 (third lane) for 3 h at 4 °C. For the fourth lane, the RIII cells were cultured in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml tetracycline for 4 days prior to the receptor cross-linking assay. The receptor-bound125I-TGFβ1 was cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed in 4–10% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The125I-TGFβ1-linked receptors were visualized after autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Consistent with a previous observation (20Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TGFβ RI and RII were not detectable by the receptor cross-linking assay on the Neo cell surface (Fig. 2). However, two bands corresponding to RI and RII were detected in the RIII cell samples. Since they were absent in the Neo cells and in the tetracycline-treated RIII cells (Fig. 2), the increased TGFβ1 binding to RI and RII appears to be specifically due to RIII expression. This is consistent with what was observed in myoblasts (24Wang X.F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 27Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). While RIII cells showed increased TGFβ1 binding to RI and RII, their sensitivity to exogenous TGFβ1 remained relatively similar to that of the Neo cells in a growth inhibition assay (20Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Therefore, we hypothesized that MCF-7 cells may express enough activated TGFβ1 such that the expression of RIII regenerated a maximal TGFβ growth inhibition in an autocrine manner. To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether the cells produced mature, activated TGFβ1 in our system. Using a TGFβ1 ELISA kit we were able to detect a modest amount of activated TGFβ1 (200 pg/106 cells/72 h) in the medium conditioned by the Neo cells. The amount of activated TGFβ1 in the medium conditioned by the RIII cells was reduced by more than half (Fig. 3). This reduction could be reversed by treating the RIII cells with tetracycline, suggesting that the reduced amount of free activated TGFβ1 in the medium was due to its binding to RIII. This result led us to further examine whether the cell growth was inhibited by the autocrine TGFβ1 after RIII expression. It is well known that TGFβ isoforms suppress cell cycle progression of newly plated, non-dividing cells more effectively than that of exponentially growing cells. Plating cells at low density is one way to ensure that the cells are maintained for a period of non- or slow-dividing state before entering exponential growth. This approach has been successfully employed previously to demonstrate the autocrine inhibitory activity of TGFβ (18Wang J. Sun L. Myeroff L. Wang X. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E.

When Neo and RIII cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates at 200 and 400 cells/well, the RIII cells proliferated significantly slower than the Neo cells by about 40% after nine days of incubation (Fig. 4 A). The growth reduction was due to reduced number of colonies as well as number of cells per colony. Treatment of the cells with tetracycline at 0.1 μg/ml prior to and during the plating efficiency assay completely reversed the growth property of the RIII cells back to that of the Neo cells as shown in Fig. 4 B suggesting that the growth inhibition was specifically due to RIII expression. To assess whether the growth reduction was due to RIII-enhanced autocrine TGFβ1activity, we treated the cells with a TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody or a control antibody after plating. While the growth of Neo cells was not affected by the antibody, the growth of the RIII cells was stimulated (Fig. 5). Even though the stimulation was only 15%, it is statistically significant (p < 0.05) by Student's t test. Since RIII expression reduced the growth by 40%, 15% growth stimulation represents a 37.5% recovery of the growth. The reason that tetracycline was more effective than the TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody to stimulate the growth of the RIII cells was probably due to the fact that tetracycline could completely suppress RIII expression whereas the antibody had to compete with the RIII for endogenous TGFβ1.Figure 5Effect of a TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody on the plating efficiency of the MCF-7 transfectants. The Neo and RIII cells were plated in 24-well plates at 400 cells/well in the presence of 30 μg/ml normal IgG (IgG) or 30 μg/ml TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody (Ab). The MTT assay was performed after 9 days of incubation. The OD values of TGFβ1 antibody treatment are presented as percent of the respective IgG-treated controls. The values are means ± S.E. determined in 6 samples from duplicate wells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm our observation that RIII expression enhanced autocrine TGFβ1activity, we measured the activity of a TGFβ-responsive promoter/luciferase construct after being transiently transfected into the Neo and RIII cells. This construct has been widely used to measure the efficacy of TGFβ in activating its signaling receptors and stimulating gene expression (10Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J.

https://openalex.org/W2031230073,"Previously, we generated monoclonal antibodies against chicken corneal cells (Zak, N. B., and Linsenmayer, T. F. (1983) Dev. Biol. 99, 373). We have now observed that one group of these antibodies reacts with a developmentally regulated component of corneal epithelial cell nuclei. This component is the heavy chain of ferritin, as determined by analyses of immunoisolated cDNA clones and immunoblotting of the protein. Immunoblotting also suggests that the nuclear ferritin may be in a supramolecular form that is similar to the iron-binding ferritin complex found in the cytoplasm of many cells. In vitro cultures and transfection studies show that the nuclear localization depends predominantly on cell type but can be altered by the in vitro environment. The appearance of nuclear ferritin is at least partially under translational regulation, as is known to be true for the cytoplasmic form of the molecule. The tissue and developmental distributions of the mRNA for the molecule are much more extensive than the protein itself, and the removal of iron from cultures of corneal epithelial cells with the iron chelator deferoxamine prevents the appearance of nuclear ferritin. At present the functional role(s) of nuclear ferritin remain unknown, but previous studies on cytoplasmic ferritin raise the possibility that it prevents damage due to free radical generation (“oxidative stress”) by sequestering iron. Although it remains to be tested whether nuclear ferritin prevents oxidative damage, we find this an attractive possibility. Since the corneal epithelium is transparent and is constantly exposed to free radical-generating UV light, it is possible that the cells of this tissue have evolved a specialized mechanism to prevent oxidative damage to their nuclear components.

Nuclei contain a myriad of different proteins as well as nucleic acids. Nuclear proteins range from general ones, such as the histones that are universally present in cells and determine the structure of chromatin, to the DNA-binding regulatory proteins, some of which are cell-specific and developmentally regulated. In the present investigation, we provide evidence that within the corneal epithelium of embryonic chicks, ferritin is also a developmentally regulated nuclear protein. In other cell types that have been investigated, the molecule is cytoplasmic and is thought to function as a protective antioxidant by sequestering iron (1Theil E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 289-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar, 2Cairo G. Tacchini L. Pogliaghi G. Anzon E. Tomasi A. Bernelli-Zazzera A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 700-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). In earlier work we sought to identify developmentally regulated components of the embryonic avian cornea by generating hybridomas against corneal cell suspensions (3Zak N.B. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). By immunofluorescence, one group of antibodies (including antibody 6D11) reacted with a corneal epithelial antigen but had little or no detectable reactivity with other tissues in the embryo. During development, this antigen first became detectable by immunofluorescence in 12-day corneas, the time when the epithelium begins to stratify (4Hay E.D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 63: 263-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We also found it to arisede novo in cultured corneas, and it has been used as a marker for corneal epithelial differentiation in studies of corneal development (5Zak N.B. Linsenmayer T.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1985; 40: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 6Zak N.B. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Biol. 1985; 108: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 7Cai C.X. Fitch J.M. Svoboda K.K.H. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 201: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In these previous studies, the immunofluorescence analyses for the epithelial antigen were done on cryostat sections of unfixed corneas. Under these conditions, the antigen showed diffuse reactivity throughout the cells. In the present study we have observed that when immunofluorescence analyses are performed on corneal tissue sections or cell cultures fixed with paraformaldehyde, the antigen is localized predominantly, if not exclusively, within the nuclei of the epithelial cells. Thus, the antigen recognized by this monoclonal antibody has the characteristics of a developmentally regulated nuclear protein. We have characterized the nuclear antigen as the heavy chain of ferritin (ferritin-H) 1The abbreviations used are: H, heavy chain; L, light chain; AOS, active oxygen species; G3PDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; IPTG, isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside; IRP, iron response protein; IRE, iron response element; SV-40, simian virus-40; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; NLS, nuclear localization signal; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CE, corneal epithelium. and have shown that it is assembled into the same supramolecular complex that is found in the cytoplasm of many other types of cells (1Theil E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 289-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Thus, it is potentially capable of sequestering iron. The nuclear molecule, like the cytoplasmic one, appears to be regulated largely by translational/post-transcriptional mechanisms. This regulation is responsive to iron and thus likely involves the well characterized translational iron response element (8Hentze M.W. Caughman S.W. Rouault T.A. Barriocanal J.G. Dancis A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1987; 238: 1570-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). We have also observed that the nuclear localization of endogenous ferritin, as well as that produced by transfected constructs, depends largely on cell type but can be modified by the cellular environment, at least in vitro. At present the functional role(s) of the nuclear ferritin remain unknown, but previous studies on cytoplasmic ferritin raise the possibility that it prevents damage to cellular components from “oxidative stress” by sequestering iron and thus lowering the concentration of active oxygen species (AOS) (for reviews see Refs. 9Janssen Y.M. Van Houten B. Borm P.J. Mossman B.T. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 261-274PubMed Google Scholarand 10Gutteridge J.M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 91: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Although it remains to be tested whether the nuclear ferritin prevents oxidative damage, we find this an attractive possibility since the corneal epithelium is transparent and is constantly exposed to AOS-generating UV light (see “Discussion”). White leghorn chicken eggs were obtained from Spafas (Norwich, CT) and incubated at 38 °C in a humidified incubator. Embryos were removed and rinsed in Hank's balanced saline solution and staged according to Hamburger and Hamilton (11Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (10048) Google Scholar). Corneas were taken from different ages of embryos, fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed, and embedded in Tissue Tek OCT. The blocks were serially sectioned at 8 μm, and the sections were mounted on 12-spot slides (Shandon Scientific, Sewickley, PA) coated with albumin. Cultured cells were fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, washed in PBS, further fixed in ice-cold 2% methanol for 5 min, and permeabilized in ice-cold 100% methanol for 5 min. Indirect immunofluorescence was done as described previously (12Fitch J.M. Mentzer A. Mayne R. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Biol. 1988; 128: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The samples were incubated with the primary antibody for 45–90 min at room temperature. The primary antibodies used were 1:250 dilutions of purified monoclonal antibody 6D11 (5 μg/ml) against a corneal epithelial antigen (3Zak N.B. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), 1:100 dilutions of monoclonal antibody 9E10 (30 μg/ml) against human c-MYC epitope (13Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar), monoclonal antibody X-AC9 against type X collagen (14Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and 1:100 dilutions of serum polyclonal antibodies against human liver ferritin, human HeLa cell ferritin, and rat heart ferritin (a gift from Dr. James Drysdale). The samples were then washed thoroughly with PBS and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody for 45–90 min. After washing in PBS, samples were mounted in glycerol/PBS (95:5) containing 1 μg/ml of Hoechst dye number 33258 (Sigma B2883) to stain the nuclei. Samples were viewed with a Nikon fluorescence photomicroscope equipped with an epi-illuminator. Photographs were taken at a 1-min exposure using Kodak Tri-X film or TMAX 400. Tissue sections were viewed with a NORMAN confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a 60 × oil lens. Z series optical sections were taken at intervals of 0.1 μm, and images were analyzed by Intervision software. The corneal epithelial cDNAs were reverse-transcribed from poly(A)+ RNA extracted from day 12, 14, 15, and 18 corneal epithelium with a Microfast-track kit (Invitrogen) and were constructed into the expression vector lambda ZAP-II following the supplier's protocol (Stratagene). The amplified library (7.2 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml) was plated, and plaques were lifted according to the protocol (Stratagene). 5 × 105 plaque-forming units were screened with 0.5 μg/ml chromatographically purified monoclonal antibody 6D11 in PBS containing 5% dry milk following the immunoscreening enhanced chemiluminescence protocol (Amersham Corp.). The positive plaques were detected by luminol-based enhanced chemiluminescence after incubation of filters with 1:5,000 dilutions of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Corp.). The positive phages were cloned, and the inserts were excised with the ExAssist™ Interference-resistant Helper Phage system (Stratagene). The sizes of the inserts were determined by PCR amplification of the plasmids using M13 forward and reverse primers, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The insert DNA was sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide termination method using the double-stranded DNA cycle sequencing system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Both vector primers as well as primers specific for the insert DNA were used for the sequencing reaction. The DNA sequence was confirmed by sequencing in both directions. Cornea, skin, liver, and heart were dissected from day 15 embryos and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Corneal epithelia from different developmental ages were scraped into diethylpyrocarbonate-treated PBS and frozen in liquid nitrogen. All tissues were stored at −80 °C until use. Total RNA from the different tissues was isolated in Trizol solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 20-μg aliquots were electrophoresed through 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels followed by overnight transfer in 10 × SSC to nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.). The membranes were prehybridized for 2 h at 65 °C in 10 ml of 5 × SSC containing 1% sarkosyl and 10 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The cDNA probes were synthesized with a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) using the gel-purified PCR product as the DNA template. The size of the probe for ferritin-H was 650 base pairs and for G3PDH was 800 base pairs. The specific activity of the32P-labeled DNA probes was greater than 1 × 108 cpm/μg. 106–107 cpm of32P-labeled cDNA probes was added into the prehybridization solution and hybridized for 16 h at 65 °C. The membranes were washed at 65 °C twice in 3 × SSC, 0.5% sarkosyl, and twice in 3 × SSC and exposed to x-ray film. Protein extracts from different tissues were prepared as described (15Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-510Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissues were homogenized in denaturing lysis buffer including 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mmiodoacetamide, 0.2 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.5% SDS on ice. The extracts were passed through a 21-gauge needle or were sonicated five times for 30 s each to shear the chromosomal DNA. For subunit analyses, the samples were boiled for 5 min, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. For nondenaturing analyses, the samples were centrifuged without boiling. The supernatants were removed, and total protein was quantitated with a BCA kit (Pierce). The expression of bacterial fusion proteins from the positive cDNA clones was induced by 1 mm IPTG. The control bacterial proteins were from cells not induced by IPTG. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation in aliquots of 1 ml of bacterial growth. The fusion proteins and bacterial proteins were extracted and quantitated as described above. Protein (40 μg) from the different tissues or from bacteria was solubilized in reducing sample buffer containing 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8, separated on a 4–20% acrylamide Ready Gel (Bio-Rad) in Tris-glycine-SDS running buffer and electrotransferred to ECL™ nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Corp.). For the nondenaturing and nonreducing gels, the proteins were solubilized in the sample buffer containing 2% SDS, without boiling or β-mercaptoethanol. Immunodetection was similar to that described for the immunoscreening of the cDNA library, except that the purified primary antibody 6D11 was diluted 1:1,000 in PBS (1.24 μg/ml). Adult chicken liver was minced, homogenized in 4 volumes of distilled H2O, and then heated at 80 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (50% saturation), and the precipitate was resuspended and dialyzed into 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Protein samples were chromatographed on a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. 2-ml samples were collected and compared with those of a horse spleen ferritin standard (Pharmacia). Further evaluation included examination by denaturing and nondenaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting with antibody 6D11. Cell cultures and transient transfections were performed using primary cells grown on 35-mm dishes. The corneal and skin epithelial cells were separated from stroma after treatment in 0.5% Dispase in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. The epithelial cells were rinsed with PBS, further digested in 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C for 5 min, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 nutrient mixture (1:1), 20% fetal calf serum (heat-inactivated), 1% chicken serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor, and penicillin and streptomycin. The corneal stromal fibroblasts and skin fibroblasts were prepared by further digestion of the separated tissues in collagenase (200 units/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Liver cells were mixed cultures of hepatocytes and fibroblasts grown in William-E medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Briefly, livers were cut into small pieces and rinsed with Hank's balanced salt solution four to five times to remove blood cells. Collagenase (200 units/ml) and trypsin (0.25%) (1:1) were used to digest the tissues at 37 °C for 2 h, with one change of fresh enzymes after 1 h. The primary cell cultures were grown for 18–24 h before transfection. For in vitro studies on the effect of iron on the regulation of the synthesis of nuclear ferritin, the iron concentration of the epithelial culture medium was manipulated by deleting endogenous iron with the chelator deferoxamine (100 μm, Sigma). As a control for possible toxic effects of the iron chelator, equimolar concentrations of the deferoxamine and ferrous sulfate (Sigma) were used. The cDNA encoding the open reading frame of ferritin-H was tagged by overlapping PCR (16Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst .). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) at the 3′-end with cDNA encoding a human c-Myc epitope (17Chen Q. Johnson D.M. Haudenschild D.R. Tondravi M.M. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Myc-tagged ferritin-H was inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector PCR™-3 (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was purified using a Qiagen maxi prep kit, and its identity was confirmed by sequencing. Transfections of primary cell cultures using 2–4 μg of DNA were performed on cultures in 35-mm dishes. Both the calcium phosphate method (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.32-16.36Google Scholar) and lipofectamine reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used. 72 h after transfection, cells were fixed as described above for immunofluorescence with the anti-myc antibody 9E10. For cell fractionation, primary cell cultures from corneal epithelium, corneal stroma, and liver of day 14 embryos were grown on 100-mm dishes in epithelial culture medium (described above). The cultures were used after 48–72 h, at which time they had approached confluency. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested with a cell scraper. The cell pellets were resuspended in a 5-fold volume of ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF). After 10 min on ice, the cells were homogenized by 8–15 strokes with a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. Lysis efficiency was monitored by trypan blue staining. After at least 80% lysis was achieved, the homogenates were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The supernatants (cytoplasmic fraction) were removed. The pellets (nuclear fraction) were resuspended in an equal volume of lysis buffer to which was added 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mmPMSF, followed by homogenization. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min to remove the insoluble materials, and the supernatants were dialyzed overnight against 0.1% SDS, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm PMSF. Protein was quantitated with a BCA kit (Pierce). Total lysates of the different cell types were prepared as for the protein extracts described above. 15 μg of total proteins from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from different cells were used for immunoblotting under the nondenaturing condition in the presence of reducing reagents (as described above). In tissue sections of paraformaldehyde-fixed corneas, the corneal epithelial antigen detected with monoclonal antibody 6D11 (3Zak N.B. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) is localized predominantly, if not exclusively, within the nuclei of the epithelial cells (Fig. 1 A). For comparison, the same section stained with Hoechst dye shows the nuclei of both the epithelial (e) and the stromal (s) cells (Fig.1 B). The inset in Fig. 1 A is a higher magnification taken by confocal laser scanning microscopy. It confirms that the immunofluorescence signal is confined to the nucleus where it is distributed throughout, except for nucleoli which are unreactive (Fig. 1 A, inset, arrows). We also examined the tissue specificity and distribution of the antigen in fixed sections of embryonic liver (Fig. 1 C), heart (Fig. 1 E), and skin (not shown). The corneal epithelium was the only tissue that showed strong reactivity and the only one in which the reactivity was nuclear (compare with the Hoechst stained sections in Fig. 1,D and F). Liver showed some cytoplasmic reactivity within the hepatocytes and the erythrocytes; in heart the only reactivity was in the erythrocytes. In skin (not shown) very weak cytoplasmic reactivity was present, as was also true on close inspection of the fibroblasts of the corneal stroma. To identify and further characterize the nuclear antigen, a corneal epithelial cDNA library was constructed in the expression vector lambda ZAP-II, and immunoscreening was performed using antibody 6D11. Fourteen of the 5 × 105 plaques screened were positive. Eight of these were cloned, and three of the clones were sequenced. Each showed 100% identity in the open reading frame (540 nucleotides encoding the 180 amino acids) and the 3′-untranslated region (175 nucleotides plus the poly(A) tail) with the cDNA sequence of the heavy chain of ferritin (ferritin-H) from chicken reticulocytes (19Stevens P.W. Dodgson J.B. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The 5′-untranslated region, however, was variably truncated with the longest clone being 30 nucleotides shorter than the reported sequence (121 nucleotides versus 151 nucleotides). This clone did, however, contain the highly conserved and functionally important iron response element (IRE) (19Stevens P.W. Dodgson J.B. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), so the shortening most likely represents a truncation in the cDNA resulting from incomplete reverse transcription. Independent confirmation of the nuclear antigen as the ferritin H-subunit was achieved by several additional criteria, such as immunofluorescence with polyclonal antibodies against ferritins from HeLa cells, rat heart, and human liver (provided by Dr. James Drysdale). The polyclonal antibodies against HeLa cell and rat heart ferritin were directed predominantly against the H-subunit (ferritin-H); those against the human liver ferritin were directed predominantly against the light, L-subunit (ferritin-L). The homology of the same subunit of ferritin (H or L) among species is greater than 85% (1Theil E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 289-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Similar to the nuclear immunoreactivity detected by monoclonal antibody 6D11 (Fig. 2 A), in day 14 corneal epithelial cells the polyclonal antisera directed predominantly against the H-subunit (the anti-HeLa cell ferritin in Fig.2 B and the anti-rat heart ferritin, not shown) exhibited the characteristic reactivity of the epithelial cell nuclei. In contrast, the antibody against human liver ferritin (predominantly against the L-subunit) produced no nuclear reactivity (not shown). These data are consistent with chicken ferritin being composed of only one type of subunit, closely related to the H-subunit of other species (20Passanitti A. Roth T.F. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (see below and “Discussion”). Immunoblocking experiments provided further confirmation that the corneal epithelial antigen recognized by monoclonal antibody 6D11 is indeed ferritin-H. The nuclear immunofluorescence produced by monoclonal antibody 6D11, as expected, could be blocked by preincubation with the IPTG-induced fusion protein produced by the cDNA clones (Fig. 2 C). More importantly (see “Discussion”), the nuclear reactivity produced by the polyclonal antibodies against the human ferritin-H-subunit could also be blocked by preincubation with this fusion protein (Fig. 2 D). In control incubations in which the antibodies were preincubated with non-IPTG-induced bacterial proteins, the nuclear immunoreactivity was not blocked (not shown). In human, the conventional iron-storage form of ferritin is a supramolecular structure composed of 24 H- and L-subunits, with a molecular mass of approximately 450 kDa (1Theil E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 289-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific forms of the human protein complex result from different ratios of the H- and L-subunits (21Drysdale J.W. Adelman T.G. Arosio P. Yokota M. Birth Defects. 1976; 12: 105-122PubMed Google Scholar), with the liver form being predominantly ferritin-L (1Theil E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 289-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). The chicken liver ferritin aggregate, however, while having a molecular mass approximately the same as that of the human, has been reported to contain only the H-subunit (22 kDa) (20Passanitti A. Roth T.F. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine whether the nuclear ferritin of the corneal epithelium is organized in the conventional supramolecular form, we performed immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody 6D11 on gel-separated denatured (Fig. 3 A) and nondenatured (Fig.3 B) protein extracts from embryonic chicken tissues. Extracts of corneal epithelium were compared with those from corneal stroma, liver, heart, and skin, as well as to the chromatographically purified protein (20Passanitti A. Roth T.F. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Under denaturing conditions (boiling in 1 or 2% SDS plus 1% β-mercaptoethanol) (Fig. 3 A), the extracts of corneal epithelium (CE) showed a strong 22-kDa band, a molecular mass identical to that of the monomer of the purified chicken ferritin. Extracts of liver and heart also showed a band with the same molecular mass and those from corneal stroma showed a very faint band. Although the skin extracts showed no detectable reactivity at this molecular mass, there probably is a small amount as determined by nondenaturing gels (described below). The 120-kDa band seen in some lanes most likely represents nonspecific binding of the labeled secondary antibody, since we sometimes observed this in the absence of the primary antibody. We are not certain about the identity of the material near the top of the gel (arrowhead) in the samples from liver, heart, and skin. It may, however, represent incompletely dissociated ferritin complex, since it was present even in purified liver ferritin when run under nonreducing conditions (data not shown). No such material was ever seen in samples from CE. In immunoblots of extracts run under nondenaturing conditions (Fig.3 B), extracts of all tissues behaved as described previously for purified chicken liver ferritin (20Passanitti A. Roth T.F. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Samples run in 2% SDS, without boiling and without reduction, gave a 240-kDa band (data not shown); in identical samples run in the presence of reducing agents, the band was shifted to 260 kDa (Fig. 3 B). This mobility shift in the presence of reducing agents suggests that thiol groups are involved in the maintenance of the compact ferritin structure from all of these sources. Thus, the nuclear ferritin of the corneal epithelium appears to share the same supramolecular structure as the cytoplasmic molecule of the other tissues. The immunoblotting data is consistent with, and supports, the immunohistochemistry, the one apparent exception being liver. Whereas tissue sections of liver show only modest reactivity for ferritin (in the cytoplasm), the immunoblots of tissue extracts show strong bands. In liver the relatively low immunofluorescence signal could reflect the fact that in hepatocytes the ferritin is distributed throughout the cytoplasm, whereas in the corneal epithelial cells it is concentrated within the nucleus. Alternatively, the epitope in hepatocyte cytoplasmin situ may be partially masked. Previous studies have shown that ferritin expression is largely regulated at the translational level (22Curtis D. Lehmann R. Zamore P.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 171-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). We tested this for the tissues we examined by comparing immunoblots of ferritin protein to corresponding Northern blots of ferritin-H mRNA (Fig.3 C).

The 3′ stem-loop region of spinach petD precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA), a chloroplast gene encoding subunit IV of the cytochromeb 6 ·f complex, forms a stable RNA-protein complex in vitro with chloroplast stem-loop binding proteins (CSPs) of 55, 41, and 29 kDa. We have previously purified CSP41 and cloned the corresponding cDNA. In vitro studies demonstrated that CSP41 is a bifunctional protein that displays both endoribonuclease and RNA-binding activities. In this work, the RNase activity of CSP41 is further characterized using the bacterially expressed protein. Our data show that CSP41 cleaves both single-stranded and double-stranded RNAs but not DNA. However, it exhibits a preference for stem-loop-containing RNAs. When the 3′-untranslated region of petD pre-mRNA is provided as a substrate, CSP41 specifically cleaves it within the stem-loop region, implying that CSP41 has an important role in the control ofpetD mRNA stability. Our data also show that the sequence-specific RNA-binding activity of CSP41 affects the rate, but not the specificity, of its RNase activity, suggesting that CSP41 is probably involved in other events of chloroplast RNA metabolism in addition to RNA degradation. By analyzing C-terminal deletions of CSP41, the RNase domain was located between amino acid residues 73 and 191. 3′-Untranslated region stem-loop structures are major determinants of chloroplast mRNA stability.

Most chloroplast precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) and mature mRNAs contain an inverted repeat sequence in their 3′-untranslated region (UTR) 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; Ni-NTA, nickel nitrilotriacetate; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; CSPs, chloroplast stem-loop binding proteins; nt, nucleotide(s); WT, wild-type. 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; Ni-NTA, nickel nitrilotriacetate; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; CSPs, chloroplast stem-loop binding proteins; nt, nucleotide(s); WT, wild-type. that can fold into a stable stem-loop structure. Both in vitro and in vivostudies have demonstrated that these 3′ stem-loop structures are required for correct 3′ processing of pre-mRNAs and for stabilization of mature mRNAs, by impeding processive 3′ to 5′ exonucleolytic degradation. In the absence of a stable secondary structure, or by readthrough of the stem-loop structure, mRNA becomes heterogeneous and generally unstable (1Drager R.G. Zeidler M. Simpson C.L. Stern D.B. RNA. 1996; 2: 652-663PubMed Google Scholar, 2Blowers A.D. Klein U. Ellmore G.S. Bogorad L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3Stern D.B. Gruissem W.

Therefore, the 3′ stem-loop structure has a primary role in controlling chloroplast mRNA accumulation through pre-mRNA processing and the protection of upstream sequences. Removal of the 3′ stem-loop structure, therefore, is likely to be a key regulatory step in chloroplast mRNA degradation. Bacterial pre- and mature mRNAs are another major group of mRNAs containing 3′-inverted repeats. The 3′ stem-loop structures of bacterial mRNAs function in the processing of pre-mRNAs and the stabilization of mature mRNAs by a mechanism similar to that found in chloroplasts (8Higgins C.F. Causton H.C. Dance G.S.C. Mudd E.A. Belasco J. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 13-30Crossref Google Scholar). Extensive studies have shown that at least three groups of proteins are involved in the control of 3′ to 5′ degradation of bacterial mRNAs: 1) endoribonucleases, such as RNase E and RNase III, which cleave the 3′-UTR within or upstream of the stem-loop structure to overcome the secondary structure barrier; 2) exoribonucleases, such as RNase II and polynucleotide phosphorylase, which bind to the free 3′ end created by the endoribonucleases and degrade mRNA in the 3′ to 5′ direction; and 3) stem-loop-binding proteins, which modulate degradation by interacting with RNA and/or RNases (8Higgins C.F.

Cell. 1994; 76: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Several reports have documented proteins that may be involved in the maturation and/or 3′ to 5′ degradation of chloroplast mRNA (6Stern D.B. Kindle K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2277-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Chen H.-C. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24205-24211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Nickelsen J. Link G. Plant J. 1993; 3: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that a multiprotein complex containing a polynucleotide phosphorylase homologue and a putative RNase E-like protein could function in spinach chloroplast mRNA 3′ processing and degradation (17Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We have previously identified a stable stem-loop-protein complex in the 3′-UTR of spinach petDpre-mRNA, a chloroplast gene encoding subunit IV of the cytochromeb 6 ·f complex (18Chen Q. Adams C.C. Usack L. Yang J. Monde R. Stern D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2010-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Complex formation requires not only the stem-loop but also an AU-rich element (box II) immediately downstream of the stem-loop. Protein components of the complex include chloroplast stem-loop binding proteins (CSPs) of 55, 41, and 29 kDa. CSP41 was purified and the corresponding nuclear gene was cloned (19Yang J. Schuster G. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1409-1420PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed and purified CSP41 displayed both endoribonuclease activity and sequence-specific RNA-binding activity. A detailed characterization of the RNA-binding activity indicated that CSP41 can bind to the stem-loop and to box II and may interact with the other CSPs. CSP41's dual functions raised the question of how these activities were interrelated and regulated. Here, we report a detailed biochemical characterization of CSP41 endoribonuclease activity. Of particular significance is that CSP41 primarily cleaves the 3′-UTR of petD mRNA within the stem-loop structure, consistent with a key role in the control of chloroplast mRNA stability. Four stem-loop-containing RNAs were used. As shown in Fig. 1, the 208-nt petDΔ50 wild-type (WT) and box II mutant (BIIa) RNAs include 84 nucleotides of the 3′ end of the petD coding region and 107 nucleotides of the petD pre-mRNA 3′-UTR, encompassing the stem-loop structure and its upstream and downstream AU-rich elements (box I and box II). The 176-nt psbA135 and 156-nt rbcL115 RNAs contain vector sequences plus 135 nucleotides of the psbApre-mRNA 3′-UTR and 115 nucleotides of the rbcLpre-mRNA 3′-UTR, respectively, beginning immediately downstream of the stop codons and encompassing their stem-loop structures. The rbcL115 RNA also includes a box II-like AU-rich element. Both petDΔ50 RNAs were synthesized as described previously (4Stern D.B. Jones H. Gruissem W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18742-18750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For psbA135 and rbcL115 RNAs, the corresponding DNAs were amplified from spinach total DNA by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) between the XbaI andEcoRI sites. The resulting plasmids were linearized withEcoRI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. For 5′-end labeling, nonradioactive petDΔ50 RNA was dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase (4Stern D.B. Jones H. Gruissem W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18742-18750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before use, all transcripts were purified from 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. To make uniformly labeled single- and double-stranded RNAs, pBluescript SK+ was separately linearized with SacI and KpnI and transcribed with T7 and T3 RNA polymerases, respectively, yielding a 118-nt RNA from the T7 promoter and a 121-nt RNA from the T3 promoter. These RNAs were gel-purified, mixed, boiled for 5 min, and then cooled to room temperature. The resulting double-stranded RNA was purified from an 8% native polyacrylamide gel. To make 5′-end-labeled single- and double-stranded DNAs, the polylinker fragments between theNotI and KpnI sites and between theSacI and KpnI sites were dephosphorylated and then labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The two strands of the labeled NotI-KpnI fragment were separated in a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the longer strand (89 nt) was recovered as 5′-end-labeled single-stranded DNA. The labeled 94-nt double-stranded SacI-KpnI fragment was purified through a 4-ml Sephadex G-25 spin column. An RNA ladder was generated by alkaline hydrolysis of 30,000 cpm of 5′-32P-petDΔ50WT RNA (15Chen H.-C. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24205-24211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pQE30-csp41 (19Yang J. Schuster G. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1409-1420PubMed Google Scholar) was used to produce N-terminal 6 × histidine-tagged wild-type CSP41 (HCSP41). Three 3′ deletions of the csp41 gene were made by restriction enzyme digestion and religation of the pQE30-csp41 plasmid. pQE30-csp41ΔE was created by digestion withEcoRV and SalI, pQE30-csp41ΔS withSmaI, and pQE30-csp41ΔP with PstI. These modified plasmids were used to produce the HCSP41 C-terminal deletion mutants HCSP41ΔE (284 amino acids), HCSP41ΔS (191 amino acids), and HCSP41ΔP (73 amino acids), respectively. HCSP41 and the mutant proteins were prepared as described (19Yang J. Schuster G. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1409-1420PubMed Google Scholar), except that to recover both RNase and RNA-binding activities of HCSP41, refolding was carried out in a buffer system containing 0.02 mm oxidized and 2 mm reduced glutathione for a minimum of 72 h. The initial concentration of denatured protein was limited to less than 0.5 μg/ml. Homogeneous HCSP41 was obtained by purification on a HiTrap-heparin FPLC cartridge (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (19Yang J. Schuster G. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1409-1420PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the mutant proteins were only purified through the Ni-NTA column. Using the oligonucleotide ATCCCCTTCAATAGCAGGAGGTGCAGCTGTAGAATT, pQE30-csp41A126 was created by site-directed mutagenesis (20Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar). HCSP41A126 mutant protein was produced and prepared as described above. Protein profiles were examined in a Bio-Rad mini-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The 30-μl standard RNase assay and the 20-μl standard gel mobility shift assay were carried out as described previously (19Yang J. Schuster G. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1409-1420PubMed Google Scholar), except that the both reaction mixtures had a pH of 7.5 instead of 7.9, and the RNase assay was carried out at 30 °C. To visualize RNA degradation and RNA binding, samples were subjected to denaturing or native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then exposed to x-ray film. The quantification of both RNase and RNA-binding activities was accomplished using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). We have previously reported that spinach CSP41, a nuclear-encoded chloroplast RNA-binding protein, can specifically bind to the 3′ stem-loop region of petD pre-mRNA. Surprisingly, we found that highly purified CSP41 also exhibited robust endoribonuclease activity, cleaving the 3′-UTR of spinachpetD pre-mRNA into multiple fragments of poly- and oligoribonucleotides (19Yang J. Schuster G. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1409-1420PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the RNase activity of CSP41, we expressed the N-terminal 6 × histidine-tagged CSP41 fusion protein (HCSP41) inE. coli and purified it through a Ni-NTA column under denaturing conditions. HCSP41 was refolded under optimized conditions and further purified by heparin-FPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”). This protocol yielded a preparation of homogeneous HCSP41 with reproducible and robust endonuclease activity. Fig.2 A shows that when uniformly labeled 208-nt petDΔ50WT RNA (Fig. 1) was provided as substrate, HCSP41 cleaved it into smaller fragments identical to those we have reported previously, although in different relative amounts. In this standard assay, 0.4 μg of refolded HCSP41 cleaved approximately 90% of the full-length substrate in 25 min. Since petDΔ50WT RNA contains a stable 46-nt stem-loop structure (see Fig. 1), it was unclear whether the endonuclease activity of CSP41 was specific for single-stranded or double-stranded RNA. It was also unknown whether CSP41 could digest DNA, as other endonucleases do (21Gite S.U. Shankar V. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 21: 101-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To test CSP41 specificity, uniformly labeled 121-nt single- and 116-base pair double-stranded RNAs and 5′-end-labeled 89-nt single- and 94-base pair double-stranded DNAs were provided as substrates under our standard conditions. Fig. 2, B andC, shows that HCSP41 can cleave both single- and double-stranded RNAs, but neither single- nor double-stranded DNAs, demonstrating that CSP41 is an RNA-specific endonuclease. However, quantification of the ribonuclease activities using a PhosphorImager revealed that only 39% of the single-stranded RNA and 36% of the double-stranded RNA was shortened, a much lower amount than that seen with petDΔ50WT RNA under the same conditions (Fig. 2 A). The higher degradation rate of petDΔ50WT RNA implies either that petDΔ50WT RNA contains preferred target sequences or structures for the RNase activity of CSP41 but the shorter RNA substrates do not or that the sequence-specific binding of CSP41 to petDΔ50WT RNA enhances its RNase activity (see below). To characterize more completely the properties of the RNase activity, we performed RNA degradation assays under a variety of conditions. Table I summarizes the results, where we define the initial cleavage of petDΔ50WT RNA in 25 min under standard conditions (Fig. 2 A) as 1.0 unit of activity. The data show that 1) CSP41 is active up to at least 55 °C and has a temperature optimum between 37 and 45 °C; 2) the pH optimum is neutral; 3) high concentrations of mono- or divalent cations, or a complete removal of divalent cations by EDTA reduces or abolishes activity; and 4) ATP does not affect RNase activity.Table ICharacterization of CSP41 endoribonuclease activityAssay conditionRelative RNase activityStandard assay1.0Temperature15 °C0.337 °C1.345 °C1.355 °C0.9pH5.50.56.50.88.50.8KCl20 mm0.940 mm0.8160 mm0.4MgCl210 mm0.720 mm0.640 mm0.0MnCl220 mm0.7ZnCl220 mm0.8EDTA20 mm0.3ATP5 mm1.030-μl standard RNase assays were carried out at 30 °C.

The RNA-binding activity of CSP41 requires an AU-rich element immediately downstream of thepetD 3′ stem-loop region. Mutations in this element, such as the BIIa mutation shown in Fig. 1, abrogate CSP41 binding (19Yang J. Schuster G. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1409-1420PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the RNA-binding activity of CSP41 enhances the RNase activity of CSP41 when petDΔ50 RNA is the substrate, we utilized uniformly labeled petDΔ50WT, petDΔ50BIIa, psbA135, and rbcL115 RNAs. As shown in Fig. 1, these RNAs contain parts of the 3′-UTRs of wild-type petD pre-mRNA, mutantpetD pre-mRNA, psbA pre-mRNA, andrbcL pre-mRNA, respectively. Each of these RNAs contains a 3′ stem-loop structure and flanking sequences, but only petDΔ50 and rbcL115 possess an immediately downstream AU-rich element. To examine their interactions with CSP41, the RNAs were first used in a gel mobility shift assay. As expected, in a standard assay containing 0.4 μg of HCSP41 and 4 fmol of RNA, HCSP41 formed a complex with petDΔ50WT RNA but not with either petDΔ50BIIa or psbA135 RNA, both of which lack the downstream AU-rich element (Fig. 3). HCSP41 also formed a complex with rbcL115 RNA, but the signal was much weaker. This difference may be due to the one-nucleotide difference between the AU-rich elements or to other sequence or structural differences. In contrast, when used as substrates in standard RNase assays, we found that each RNA was rapidly cleaved into smaller fragments. Even in the relatively slow reactions, such as those with psbA135 or rbcL115 RNAs, less than 20% of the precursor remained after 25 min, as shown in Fig. 4 A. It is especially notable that HCSP41 cleaves petDΔ50WT and petDΔ50BIIa nearly identically, although the protein binds stably only to petDΔ50WT RNA under these conditions. When samples were taken over the 25-min time course, the profiles of petDΔ50WT and petDΔ50BIIa cleavages were similar in each case (data not shown). However, it took nearly twice the time for HCSP41 to degrade 50% of the petDΔ50WT precursor (∼8 min) than to degrade 50% of the petDΔ50BIIa precursor (∼4 min, Fig. 4 B). Taken together, these data suggest that the RNA-binding activity of CSP41 does not alter the specificity but partially decreases the efficiency of its RNase activity, probably due to conformational changes of bound CSP41, and/or a limitation of accessible substrate for free CSP41. The RNase activity clearly shows a preference for stem-loop-containing RNAs over other single- and double-stranded RNAs, which strongly suggests that some specific sequences or structures in the RNAs are efficiently recognized.Figure 4HCSP41 cleaves the 3′-UTRs of four chloroplast pre-mRNAs. A, 20 fmol of the uniformly labeled RNAs shown at the top were incubated with 2 μg of HCSP41 in 30-μl standard reactions. 5 μl of the reaction was stopped at the times indicated at the bottom and analyzed in a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. B, two RNase assays, using petDΔ50WT (WT) and petDΔ50BIIa (BIIa) RNAs, were performed as described in A. The insetshows the initial degradation of the RNA precursors during the 25-min time course shown at the top. The RNA remaining was quantified with a PhosphorImager. Data for petDΔ50WT (•) and petDΔ50BIIa (○) were plotted, with bars showing standard errors from four reactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although HCSP41 cleaves petDΔ50 RNA into multiple shorter fragments, we noted in experiments such as the one shown in Fig. 2 A that certain products were much more prevalent than others. To identify the initial cleavage products of petDΔ50WT RNA, a time course of RNase digestion was carried out, as shown in Fig. 5. The group of bands marked withsingle asterisk in Fig. 5 comprises the earliest products, appearing as early as the 0-min time point, with the cleavage apparently occurring during the mixing of the reaction. Two other groups of bands, marked with two or three asterisks in Fig. 5, were generated by HCSP41 within 2 min. Subsequently, additional fragments were generated, either transiently or stably. At the end of the 120-min reaction, all the larger products were completely degraded and accumulated as very short RNA fragments seen near the bottom of the gel. To determine the locations of the initial cleavage sites, 5′-end-labeled petDΔ50WT RNA was synthesized and used as a substrate. A parallel assay used uniformly labeled petDΔ50WT RNA. Fig.6 A shows that by comparing the patterns generated by the two substrates, it could be concluded that the group of initial cleavage products of petDΔ50WT RNA marked with asingle asterisk in Fig. 5, and one of the groups of the secondary cleavage products of petDΔ50WT RNA marked with two asterisks, retained the original 5′-terminus. When calibrated using an alkaline RNA ladder and a 47-nt RNA marker, the initial cleavage sites were determined to be at nucleotides 133–137 and 141–142. The secondary cleavage sites were at nucleotides 114–115 and 119–120. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 6 B, CSP41 initially cleaves petDΔ50 RNA within the 3′ stem-loop and subsequently upstream. Another group of secondary products, marked with three asterisks in Fig. 5, and other shorter products, were not seen in the assay with 5′-end-labeled substrate, indicating that they are internal or 3′-end-containing products. Using the same approach, we found that CSP41 initially cleaved 5′-end-labeled petDΔ50BIIa RNA at identical sites to those indicated in Fig. 6, demonstrating again that the RNA-binding activity of CSP41 is not related to the specificity of its RNase activity (data not shown). Although it exhibits strong RNase activity, the primary amino acid sequence of CSP41 does not show significant overall similarity to any nuclease in the data bases. To begin locating domains of CSP41 required for RNase activity, we constructed 3′ deletion mutants of CSP41 and examined RNase activities of the resulting proteins. For this purpose, increasingly long C-terminal deletions of CSP41 were generated by restriction enzyme digestion of pQE30-csp41. Wild-type and mutant proteins (Fig.7 A) were expressed in E. coli, purified through an Ni-NTA column, and then refolded, but were not subjected to further heparin-FPLC purification as in other experiments described above, since the mutant proteins have very low affinity for heparin. Their purities were examined in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 7 B), showing that there is only one major contaminant (marked with an asterisk) in each preparation. These protein preparations were then tested for RNase activity in standard assays, as determined by quantification of the remaining petDΔ50WT RNA over a 25-min time course. The results shown in Fig. 7 C indicate that HCSP41ΔS, ΔE, and wild-type HCSP41 quickly degrade petDΔ50 RNA, but much less RNase activity was displayed by HCSP41ΔP. A comparison of their degradation profiles, shown in Fig.8, reveals that both HCSP41ΔS and ΔE degrade petDΔ50 RNA in the same manner as wild-type HCSP41 but that HCSP41ΔP does not. Therefore, an essential domain for HCSP41 RNase activity is located between amino acid residues 73 and 191. Based on the results shown in Fig. 4 B, the fact that HCSP41ΔS and ΔE degrade petDΔ50 RNA more quickly than wild-type HCSP41 may imply that the C terminus of CSP41 is involved in the RNA-binding activity. In this hypothesis, removal or partial removal of the C terminus would eliminate or partially eliminate the RNA-binding activity of CSP41 and thus enhance the efficiency of its RNase activity.Figure 8RNA degradation profiles of HCSP41 deletion mutants. Gel analysis of the RNase assays described in Fig.7 C are shown. Time points, at which 5 μl of reactions were stopped, are indicated at the bottom. At the top,WT, wild-type HCSP41; ΔE, HCSP41ΔE; ΔS, HCSP41ΔS; ΔP, HCSP41ΔP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although no overall similarity was noted between CSP41 and other proteins, careful examination of the search results revealed a 50-amino acid stretch from Glu127 to Trp176 of CSP41 which has 50% similarity to a sequence from Gln123 to Trp172 of nuclease P1, a bacterial endonuclease. Furthermore, this region contains the proposed active site of nuclease P1 (Pro124Leu125His126), which can be aligned with Pro128Pro129His130 of CSP41 (Fig. 9 A; 22). Because the 50-amino acid sequence lies within the region containing the RNase domain of CSP41, we decided to test whether this sequence contributed to CSP41 RNase function. We used the alanine-scanning approach (23Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) to make mutant HCSP41A126, changing the wild-type sequence Asp126Glu127Pro128Pro129His130to Ala126Ala127Pro128Pro129Ala130. In this way, all of the hydrophilic residues in the immediate vicinity of the putative active site were changed. HCSP41A126 was prepared in the same way as the deletion mutant proteins. To avoid any variation in the RNase activity due to expression and purification conditions, especially to efficiency of refolding, a wild-type HCSP41 preparation was concomitantly made as a control. The purities of the preparations were examined in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 9 B). In contrast to our expectations, HCSP41A126 still exhibited strong endoribonuclease activity (Fig. 9 C), similar to that of wild-type HCSP41. We conclude that RNase active site of CSP41 is not contained within this sequence. In this paper we have shown that CSP41, a spinach chloroplast endoribonuclease, is able to cleave multiple single- and double-stranded RNA molecules but not DNA. CSP41 appears to exhibit a preference for stem-loop structures found at the 3′ termini of chloroplast mRNAs, and we have shown that for petD it cleaves initially within the stem and subsequently proximal to it. Since the stem-loop is known to stabilize chloroplast transcripts (1Drager R.G. Zeidler M. Simpson C.L. Stern D.B. RNA. 1996; 2: 652-663PubMed Google Scholar, 2Blowers A.D. Klein U. Ellmore G.S.

Biol. 1996; 31: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), this cleavage could be a rate-determining step inpetD mRNA degradation. 3′ to 5′ exonucleolytic hydrolysis is a major pathway for mRNA degradation in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and organelles. Initially, an endoribonuclease is usually required to overcome a 3′ barrier, such as a stem-loop structure or poly(A) tail, to generate free 3′ ends susceptible to exoribonucleases (11Petersen C. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Gruissem W. Schuster G. Belasco J. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability.

RNase III and RNase E are two of the best-characterized endoribonucleases in bacteria (9Ehretsmann C.P. Carpousis A.J. Krisch H.M. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3186-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and eukaryotic homologues have been reported (26Wennborg A. Sohlberg B. Angerer D. Klein G. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Elela S.A. Igel H. Ares M.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In bacteria, RNase III and RNase E can cleave mRNAs within and upstream, respectively, of mRNA 3′ stem-loop structures (28Régnier P. Hajnsdorf E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Guarneros G. Montanez C. Hernandez T. Court D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Hajnsdorf E. Steier O. Coscoy L. Teysset L. Régnier P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3368-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Since CSP41 is a chloroplast endoribonuclease and cleaves initially within a stem-loop structure, it is more similar to RNase III than to RNase E. However, RNase III typically makes staggered, double-strand cleavages in duplexed regions, whereas CSP41 cleaves only one strand in the duplex region of petDΔ50 RNA. In addition, RNase III has a K+optimum of 100–300 mm, conditions under which CSP41 RNase activity is partially inhibited (Table I). Several endoribonuclease activities, namely EndoC1, EndoC2, and a putative RNase E-like protein, have been identified in spinach chloroplasts by our laboratory and others (15Chen H.-C. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24205-24211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although each activity can cleave the 3′-UTR of petD mRNA in vitro, a comparison of cleavage sites and optional conditions for their activities suggests that CSP41 is distinct from them. It is important to note, however, that each of these other spinach chloroplast activities was examined only in a complex mixture of proteins. CSP41 also does not appear to be related to nuclease P1, despite 50% similarity over a 50-amino acid region (Fig. 9). Therefore, CSP41 could represent a new class or subclass of ribonucleases. Our data show that CSP41 degrades both single- and double-stranded RNAs but prefers RNAs containing a stable stem-loop structure (Figs. 2 and4). These data suggest that CSP41 could recognize certain special nucleotide sequences or structural features of stem-loop regions. We have noted that the two groups of initial cleavage sites are located immediately upstream of two bulges in the petD stem-loop structure (Fig. 6 B). However, further characterization of CSP41 RNase activity, especially using other stem-loop-containing RNAs as substrates, is necessary to define its specificity. The 3′ stem-loop structure of chloroplast mRNA has been demonstrated to function as a determinant of both correct 3′ processing of pre-mRNA and stabilization of mature mRNA by impeding the activities of 3′ to 5′ processive exonucleases (1Drager R.G. Zeidler M. Simpson C.L. Stern D.B. RNA. 1996; 2: 652-663PubMed Google Scholar, 2Blowers A.D. Klein U. Ellmore G.S. Bogorad L. Mol. Gen.

Biol. 1996; 31: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our study suggests that CSP41 may be a candidate to overcome the 3′ secondary structure and initiate degradation of upstream RNA sequences, possibly through the polyadenylation-mediated pathway shown to function in bacteria (31Xu F. Cohen S.N. Nature. 1995; 374: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 32Haugel-Nielsen J. Hajnsdorf E. Régnier P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3144-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and chloroplasts (33Kudla J. Hayes R. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1997; 15: 7137-7146Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 34Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although some RNases have RNA-binding activities to target their substrates (35Court D. Belasco J. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 71-116Crossref Google Scholar), the RNA-binding activity of CSP41 does not enhance specificity or efficiency of its RNase activity in our in vitro assay (Fig. 4), indicating that this RNA-binding activity could be involved in a second function. CSP41 possesses two important properties as an RNA-binding protein. First, it binds only to the 3′-UTRs of certain chloroplast pre-mRNAs, such as those ofpetD and rbcL, because it recognizes both the 3′ stem-loop structure and a downstream AU-rich element (Fig. 3); and second, it interacts with CSP55 and CSP29 to form a more stable complex containing the 3′-UTR of the selected pre-mRNA and multiple protein subunits (18Chen Q. Adams C.C. Usack L. Yang J. Monde R. Stern D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2010-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Yang J. Schuster G. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1409-1420PubMed Google Scholar). Although the functions of CSP55 and CSP29 are still unknown, it is possible that the function of CSP41 could be altered in this larger complex by suppression of its RNase activity. In fact, our data suggest that bound CSP41 may cleave substrate RNAs less efficiently than free CSP41 (Fig. 4). Therefore, our data support one of our previous (19Yang J. Schuster G. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1409-1420PubMed Google Scholar) models that CSP41 could have two functions in chloroplast mRNA metabolism. First, free CSP41 could directly cleave chloroplast mRNA and pre-mRNA in the 3′ stem-loop structure to initiate bulk mRNA degradation, and second, as CSP41, along with CSP55 and CSP29, forms a stable RNA-protein complex with the 3′ stem-loop structure of a pre-mRNA, its RNase activity could be suppressed and the entire complex could serve as a steric hindrance to 3′ to 5′ processive exoribonucleases, and thus ensure efficient 3′ end maturation.

Histone H4 mRNA synthesized from plasmid templates microinjected into oocyte nuclei is translationally silenced (masked). This masked mRNA becomes translationally active only after oocyte maturation. In contrast, histone H4 mRNA injected into the oocyte cytoplasm is translationally active both before and after oocyte maturation. Thus, transcription in vivo is required to mask histone H4 mRNA and to allow subsequent translational regulation. Protein association with histone H4 mRNA synthesized in vivo was determined before and after oocyte maturation. UV cross-linking of radiolabeled RNA to protein and immunoprecipitation of cross-linked proteins reveals an increased association of the chaperone nucleoplasmin with ribonucleoprotein particles dependent on the oocyte maturation process. The Y-box protein FRGY2 inhibits translation of histone H4 mRNA in vitro. Nucleoplasmin is able to partially relieve this repression.

We discuss the potential role of nuleoplasmin in the remodeling of repressive ribonucleoprotein particles containing maternal mRNA to facilitate translational activation. The translational control of maternal mRNA is a major regulatory mechanism for gene expression during earlyXenopus development (1Standart N. Semin. Dev. Biol. 1992; 3: 369-379Google Scholar, 2Wickens M. Semin. Dev. Biol. 1992; 3: 399-412Google Scholar, 3Wormington M. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Maternal mRNA is packaged into ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs, informosomes) 1The abbreviations used are: mRNP, maternal ribonucleoprotein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. (4Spirin A.S. Mol. Rep. Dev. 1994; 38: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 5Standart N. Jackson R. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 939-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). RNA-binding proteins, including those of the Y-box family of proteins, maintain mRNA in a translationally repressed or masked form (6Minich W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1992; 74: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Ranjan M. Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Removal of the Y-box proteins from mRNA in vitro facilitates translational activation (10Richter J.D. Smith L.D. Nature. 1984; 309: 378-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11Kick D. Barrett P. Cummings A. Sommerville J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4099-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus one potential translational regulatory mechanism might involve the removal of repressive Y-box proteins from maternal mRNA. In addition, true activation mechanisms exist that further facilitate translation of maternal mRNA. Most masked mRNAs that are in the oocyte have short poly(A) tails that are lengthened during oocyte maturation concomitant with translational activation (unmasking) (12McGrew L.L. Dworkin-Rastl E. Dworkin M.B. Richter J.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 13Sheets M.D. Wu M. Wickens M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30804-30810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The poly(A) tail directly stimulates the initiation of translation (15Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The exact molecular events that might regulate the translational activation of any masked maternal mRNA are not yet known. Multiple molecular mechanisms are likely to contribute to the translational regulation of any specific mRNA. In this work we investigate the translational regulation of histone H4 mRNA during the maturation of Xenopus oocytes inducedin vitro using progesterone (12McGrew L.L. Dworkin-Rastl E. Dworkin M.B. Richter J.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 13Sheets M.D. Wu M. Wickens M. Nature. 1995; 374: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We chose histone H4 mRNA because the endogenous message is abundant inXenopus oocytes and the vast majority of H4 mRNA is masked (16Ruderman J.V. Woodland H.R. Sturgess E.A. Dev. Biol. 1979; 71: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The rate of histone H4 synthesis increases 50-fold on oocyte maturation without an increase in histone H4 mRNA polyadenylation (17Adamson E.D. Woodland H.R. Dev. Biol. 1977; 57: 136-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Ballantine J.E.M. Woodland H.R. FEBS Lett. 1985; 180: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In fact histone H4 mRNA is polyadenylated in oocytes (16Ruderman J.V. Woodland H.R. Sturgess E.A. Dev. Biol. 1979; 71: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Ballantine J.E.M. Woodland H.R. FEBS Lett. 1985; 180: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the poly(A) tail is removed during the maturation process (18Ballantine J.E.M. Woodland H.R. FEBS Lett. 1985; 180: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus the unmasking of histone H4 mRNA most probably involves the mobilization of mRNA from stores present as masked ribonucleoprotein particles by removal of a repressor protein rather than activation via polyadenylation dependent mechanisms (18Ballantine J.E.M. Woodland H.R. FEBS Lett. 1985; 180: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,19Woodland H.R. Wilt F.H. Dev. Biol. 1980; 75: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We first reconstitute the regulated unmasking of histone H4 during oocyte maturation using mRNA synthesized from plasmid DNA templates microinjected into the oocyte nucleus. We next examine the proteins associated with H4 mRNA before and after oocyte maturation by UV cross-linking to radiolabeled mRNA. We purify the major protein whose association with H4 mRNA increases during oocyte maturation. This protein is nucleoplasmin, a well known chaperone stored in theXenopus oocyte nucleus in large amounts (290 ng/oocyte) until oocytes mature and the nuclear envelope breaks down (20Mills A.D. Laskey R.A. Black P. De Robertis E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Nucleoplasmin has the role of removing specialized arginine-rich protamines from Xenopus sperm chromatin (21Leno G.H. Mills A.D. Philpott A. Laskey R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7253-7256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We propose that it has a comparable role in facilitating the removal of the arginine-rich Y-box proteins from maternal mRNA, thereby potentiating translation. The SP6H4F construct has been described elsewhere (22Freeman L. Kurumizaka H. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12780-12785Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal FLAGged (IBI) H4 sequence was amplified from SP6H4F using the primers 5′-ACCTTCCATGGCCTTAACCTCCGAATCCGTACAGAGTGCG-3′ and 5′-AATTTGAATTCTAGAAAAGATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTCTGGAAGAGGCAAGAGGCAAGGGC-3′. This fragment was subcloned into theXbaI/NcoI sites of the pCAT-Basic vector (Promega), and the cytomegalovirus promoter (23Boshart M. Weber F. Gerhard J. Dorsch-Hasler K. Fleckenstern B. Schafner W. Cell. 1985; 41: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) was subcloned into theHindIII/XbaI sites to give CMV.H4F. All constructions were confirmed by sequencing. In vitro transcription reactions were performed using SP6 RNA polymerase as described (24Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Templates were linearized with EcoRI downstream from a poly(A) tract to give polyadenylated RNA. RNA synthesis was carried out in the presence of a 10:1 cap analog to rGTP ratio to obtain 5′ capped transcripts (8Bouvet P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 931-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Transcribed RNA was phenol/chloroform extracted and ethanol-precipitated. Xenopus oocytes were prepared as described previously (25Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Stage VI oocytes were sorted and used within 24 h of oocyte preparation. Oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (26Heasman J. Holwill S. Wylie C.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 213-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To ensure accuracy in the nuclear versus cytoplasmic injection experiments, the injection volume was kept to 9.2 nl and cytoplasmic injections were performed into the vegetal pole. After injection, only oocytes with homogenous pigmentation and normal turgor were collected. Collected oocytes were homogenized in 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (10 μl/oocyte) and aliquoted for protein and RNA analysis. A minimum of 30–40 oocytes were injected per item of data. All results were reproduced in at least three separate experiments. In vitro oocyte maturation was carried out in oocyte culture medium (26Heasman J. Holwill S. Wylie C.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 213-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) using 1 μg/ml progesterone (Sigma). Oocyte maturation was determined by the appearance of a white spot at the animal pole indicative of germinal vesicle breakdown. Labeled in vitro transcribed RNA was obtained by introducing 50 μCi of [32P]UTP or [32P]GTP into the reaction. In vivo labeling was obtained by injecting [32P]UTP or [32P]GTP (1 μCi/oocyte) in the oocyte nucleus. After the indicated time, oocytes (whole, nucleus, or cytoplasm) were homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 100 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 50 mm sucrose (3 μl/oocyte). After centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, protein extracts were exposed to UV light for 10 min on ice; then RNase A was added (0.5 μg/μl) and digestion was allowed for 1 h at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitation of the cross-linked proteins used antibodies against nucleoplasmin purified from serum using protein-A agarose (27Dimitrov S. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5897-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Using the fact that nucleoplasmin is soluble at 80 °C (28Laskey R.A. Honda B.M. Mills A.D. Finch J.T. Nature. 1978; 275: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), proteins extracted from oocytes were heated for 10 min at 80 °C, then placed on ice for 10 min. The soluble proteins cross-linked to radiolabeled RNA were then incubated with 15 μg of purified IgG containing nucleoplasmin antibody and 50 μl of IgG Sorb (The Enzyme Center, Malden, Massachusetts) in RIPA buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at room temperature. Complexes were washed five times with RIPA buffer, then three times with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and then treated with RNase A as above. Proteins were released by adding 25 μl of a solution of 1% SDS, 0.2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and heating 10 min at 100 °C. RNA was extracted from the homogenate by the RNAzol method (Cinna Scientific). RNA was analyzed by primer extension as described (29Toyoda T. Wolffe A.P. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Primer extension was performed using the primer 5′-GGCTTGGTGATGCCCTGGATGTTATCC-3′ which detects both exogenous and endogenous histone H4 mRNA. Batches of 15 oocytes were homogenized in 75 μl of protein homogenization buffer (70 mm KCl, 90 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% sucrose). This homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant removed. Radiolabeled H4 protein was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Before autoradiography, gels were treated for 30 min with Amplify (Amersham). For detection of FLAG (IBI) epitope-tagged histone H4 protein by Western analysis, oocytes were homogenized in protein homogenization buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. An equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer was added to the supernatant, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). Affinity-purified anti-FLAG (IBI) monoclonal antibody was used in immunodetection. Heat-purified extract from in vitro matured oocytes (100 oocytes/sample) was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a PVDF membrane. NH2-terminal sequencing of the appropriate protein was attempted, but the NH2 terminus was found to be blocked. In a repetition of this experiment the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the appropriate protein band was cut out and electroeluted. The protein was precipitated with 80% trichloroacetic acid and the pellet washed with acetone, 0.2% HCl, then acetone alone. The pellet was resuspended in 10% cyanogen bromide in 70% formic acid, and cleaved overnight at 37 °C. After a 10-fold dilution with high performance liquid chromatography grade water, the mixture was lyophilized. The cleavage products were resuspended in 8 m urea, and an equivalent volume of SDS buffer added. Products were resolved on a 8–20% Tris glycine gradient gel (Novex) and transferred to a PVDF membrane in 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid buffer. The membrane was washed first with distilled water, then methanol, and then stained with Coomassie Blue. The cleavage products were sequenced. Fractionation was performed as described (30Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24255-24261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One hundred oocytes were homogenized in 180 μl of 1 × gradient buffer (0.3 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and 20 units of RNasin was added. The extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and 200 μl of the soluble fraction was layered on top of 5 ml of a 20–60% Nycodenz step gradient in 1 × gradient buffer. The gradient was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 h at 4 °C in a SW50.1 rotor (Beckman). The gradient was fractionated in 27 fractions (1–27 from top to bottom). Nucleoplasmin purified fromXenopus egg extracts was a kind gift of Dr. Stefan Dimitrov (27Dimitrov S. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5897-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The capped histone H4 mRNA was synthesized by SP6 RNA polymerase transcription from EcoRI-linearized pSP H4F (22Freeman L. Kurumizaka H. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In vitro translation was performed with the nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Histone H4 mRNA (0.13 μg) was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min in a 25-μl reaction mixture consisting of 15 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 50 μm each of amino acids including 87.5 μCi of [3H]lysine and 17.5 μCi of [3H]arginine, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), and Tail domain protein (FRGY2.D6, see Ref. 31Matsumoto K.

Acid-soluble protein was prepared as described (8Bouvet P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 931-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The aliquots were subjected to electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and 5% acetic acid (32Panyim S. Chalkley R. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3972-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The gel was fixed, treated with Amplify (Amersham Corp.), and dried. The translation products were detected by fluorography. In earlier work we have described the translational masking of histone H1 mRNA by quantitating protein synthesis per mass of mRNA (8Bouvet P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 931-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Histone H1 mRNA synthesized in vivo from a plasmid DNA molecule injected into the oocyte nucleus was translated 50–100-fold less efficiently than the H1 mRNA microinjected into the nucleus (8Bouvet P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 931-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Histone H1 mRNA is a bona fide translationally masked mRNA in the oocyte (30Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24255-24261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Woodland H.R. Flynn J.M. Wyllie A.J. Cell. 1979; 18: 165-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have also examined whether the requirement for transcription in vivoto establish efficient masking of mRNA was a general phenomenon (14Meric F.M. Searfoss A.M. Wormington M. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30804-30810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Heterologous mRNAs such as those encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or luciferase are translationally active if they are injected into the oocyte cytoplasm but are translationally masked if they are synthesized in vivo (14Meric F.M. Searfoss A.M. Wormington M. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30804-30810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Endogenous H4 mRNA (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–3) is not translationally active (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) as expected from earlier results (19Woodland H.R. Wilt F.H. Dev. Biol. 1980; 75: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To discriminate between endogenous and exogenous experimental H4 mRNA we modified the coding sequence to contain a FLAG (IBI) epitope tag at the amino terminus (see “Materials and Methods”), this additional nucleotide sequence enabled distinction between endogenous and exogenous H4 mRNA using primer extension assays (Fig. 1 A, “Materials and Methods”). Note that the histone H4 mRNA synthesized from the CMV.H4F expression vector following injection into the Xenopus oocyte nucleus (Fig.1 A, lane 3, in vivo synthesized exogenous H4 mRNA) is longer at the 5′ end than the histone H4 mRNA synthesized in vitro using SP6 RNA polymerase and the SP6 H4F expression vector (Fig. 1 A, lane 2, in vitro synthesized exogenous H4 mRNA). This additional sequence in the 5′-untranslated region has no influence on the translational activity of the H4 mRNA, or the translational activity of the H4 mRNA, or mRNA stability (see Bouvet and Wolffe (8Bouvet P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 931-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar)). 2F. Meric, K. Matsumoto, and A. P. Wolffe, unpublished observations. Microinjection of exogenous histone H4 mRNA synthesized in vitro into the oocyte cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A, lane 2), or microinjection of a plasmid DNA molecule (H4 DNA CMV.H4F) into the oocyte nucleus directing the synthesis of exogenous H4 mRNA (Fig.1 A, lane 3) was followed by radiolabeling of newly synthesized protein in a 6-h period (Fig. 1 B). Comparable levels of in vitro or in vivo synthesized exogenous H4 mRNA (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 2and 3, Table I) show very different efficiencies for synthesis of epitope-tagged histone H4 protein (Fig.1 B, compare lanes 2 and 3; Table I). The in vitro synthesized exogenous H4 mRNA is translated into epitope-tagged H4 protein (Fig. 1 B, lane 2, arrowhead) much more efficiently than the in vivo synthesized mRNA (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). Note that the epitope-tagged histone H4 (indicated as H4 epitope-tagged, arrowhead) migrates as a larger protein than endogenous histone H4 (indicated by theasterisk). Thus like histone H1, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, and luciferase mRNAs, the exogenous histone H4 mRNA is translationally active if injected into the oocyte cytoplasm, but is translationally repressed if synthesized from a plasmid template injected into the oocyte nucleus. Quantitation of relative translational efficiencies indicate a ∼25-fold repression ofin vivo synthesized versus in vitro synthesized H4 mRNA (Table I).Table ITranslational efficiency of in vitro and in vivo transcribed RNA after injection into oocytesmRNA (A.U.)Protein (A.U.)RatioH4 RNA652,754250100H4 DNA1,706,080253.8The experiment shown in Fig. 1 were quantified.

H4 mRNA level was quantified by use of the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Quantification of 3H-labeled H4 protein was performed by scanning the autoradiogram using a densitometer. Translational efficiency was standardized by the level of mRNA. We have established conditions for the translational masking of histone H4 mRNA following synthesis of the mRNAin vivo (Fig. 1). We next examined whether this masked mRNA would be released for translation on oocyte maturation and hence come under the appropriate developmental control. We repeated the experiment of injecting histone H4 mRNA into the cytoplasm or synthesizing H4 mRNA in vivo, however, we added the additional step of inducing oocyte maturation with progesterone (Fig.2 A). As a control we made use of our primer extension assay to determine the level of the various histone H4 mRNAs at the end of our experiments (Fig. 2 B). Incubation in the presence of progesterone leads to a small decline in the abundance of all the histone H4 mRNAs (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1 and 2). This result was confirmed by Northern blotting (data not shown). We next examined the translation of the exogenous H4 mRNA. In the absence of progesterone treatment, immunoblotting with antibodies specific for the FLAG epitope indicates that exogenous histone H4 mRNA synthesized in vitro and injected into the cytoplasm is translated (Fig. 2 C, lane 2), whereas that synthesized in vivo is masked (Fig. 2 C, lane 4). Maturation of oocytes with progesterone has no effect on the translation of histone H4 mRNA injected into the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 C, compare lanes 2 and 3), but leads to the unmasking of histone H4 mRNA synthesized in vivo (Fig. 2 C, compare lanes 4 and5). Thus histone H4 mRNA synthesized in vivofrom plasmid DNA templates comes under the appropriate developmental control at oocyte maturation, whereas histone H4 mRNA microinjected into oocyte cytoplasm does not. In earlier work (30Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24255-24261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we made use of density gradient centrifugation to show that masked maternal mRNA is assembled exclusively into mRNPs, but that on release to the translational machinery mRNA is distributed between mRNPs and ribosomes. Histone H4 mRNA exhibits similar behavior. Histone H4 mRNA is exclusively in mRNPs prior to oocyte maturation (Fig.2 D,Pre) and redistributes between mRNPs and ribosomes post-maturation (Fig. 2 D, Post). Note that these Northern blots of gradient fractions are only to compare the distribution of H4 mRNA between various RNP fractions. Since there is no transcription in Xenopus from oocyte maturation until the mid-blastula transition of Xenopus embryogenesis (34Newport J.W. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1982; 30: 687-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar,35La Marca M.J. Fidler M.C.F. Smith L.D. Krem K. Dev. Biol. 1975; 47: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) there is no increase in H4 mRNA abundance from levels in the oocyte until after that time. We next examined the molecular mechanisms responsible for the release of H4 mRNA from storage ribonucleoprotein particles to the ribosomes. A major event associated with oocyte maturation is the breakdown of the nuclear envelope. This leads to a mixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic components with important consequences for transcription (35La Marca M.J. Fidler M.C.F. Smith L.D. Krem K. Dev. Biol. 1975; 47: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and translation (36Varnum S.M. Hurney C.A. Wormington W.M. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We wished to explore whether oocyte maturation would alter the distribution of proteins that could be cross-linked to radiolabeled histone H4 mRNA. In earlier work we had documented the association of proteins with radiolabeled mRNA synthesized in vitro using this strategy (8Bouvet P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 931-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 37Bouvet P. Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28297-28303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The Y-box protein FRGY2 interacts with mRNA microinjected into the oocyte nucleus or cytoplasm (8Bouvet P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 931-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 30Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24255-24261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Matsumoto K. Meric F. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22706-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The capacity for FRGY2 to bind to histone H4 mRNA is unchanged in this assay following oocyte maturation (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 1 with2 and 3 with 4, FRGY2 is indicated with an asterisk). The identity of FRGY2 was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments (Ref. 8Bouvet P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 931-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar; data not shown). This result is consistent with the continued presence of histone H4 mRNA in mRNPs after oocyte maturation (Fig. 2 D). Several other radiolabeled proteins appear, two have masses of ∼250 and 30 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3 A). The identity of the ∼250-kDa protein is unknown. The properties of the 30-kDa protein suggest that it is phosvitin; this is an egg yolk protein of ∼30 kDa, that contains 56% of the amino acids in the protein as potentially phosphorylated serines (38Tata J.R. Smith D.F. Recent Prog. Hormone Res. 1979; 35: 47-95PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is readily radiolabeled following injection of any [32P]nucleotide triphosphate into Xenopus oocytes, it is heat-stable (see Fig.4), and is not extracted by phenol/chloroform treatment.2 It is a highly radioactive contaminant of our experiments. Our attention focussed on a protein of apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa that associates with histone H4 mRNA after oocyte maturation, but not before (Fig. 3 A, arrowhead). We substantially scaled up this analysis and resolved total protein after heat purification (Fig. 3 A, lane 5, see below) on SDS-PAGE before transfer to PVDF membranes. Note that the radioactive 30-kDa protein (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–4) is not visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, suggesting that it is a minor contaminant of our preparations in terms of protein mass. NH2-terminal sequencing of the 34-kDa protein was attempted, but the NH2terminus was found to be blocked. After repeat electrophoresis of the extract, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and the appropriate protein band was cut out and electroeluted. The protein was cleaved with cyanogen bromide before resolution by SDS-PAGE and transfer to a PVDF membrane (Fig. 3 B). The cleavage products were analyzed by NH2-terminal sequencing, Product 1 (Fig. 3 B) was blocked; however, Product 2 gave the sequence indicated (Fig.3 C). Sequence analysis revealed an identity with an internal peptide sequence of Xenopus laevis nucleoplasmin (39Dingwall C. Dilworth S.M. Black S.J. Kearsey S.E. Cox L.S. Laskey R.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We next proceeded to independently test the identity of the 34-kDa protein.Figure 4Detection of nucleoplasmin association with histone H4 mRNA synthesized in vivo following oocyte maturation by immunoprecipitation.

Because of the widespread implications of these predictions, methods to combine demography and epidemiology to study empirical situations have been an urgent priority. This study derives the extent and mechanisms of demographic impacts of AIDS from routine data (the 1991 census) in a severely affected country, Uganda. Three characteristics are of particular note: first, the emergence of demographic impacts much earlier than previously estimated; second, their localization with negative population growth at parish but not at district or national scales; third, a greater impact on the number of children than previously predicted1,2, due as much to changes in population fertility as mortality. The emergence of demographic impacts at this stage highlights original aspects of the interdependence of HIV infection and demographic growth not previously recorded and the need to target preventive interventions to youth in developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W1579236928,"Development of T lymphocyte is a complex process that depends on both thymocytestromal cell interactions and the production of soluble factors such as cytokines, peptides, and hormones. In many tissues, the concentration of active biological peptides is regulated locally by a specialized family of enzymes: the ectopeptidases. We show here that treatment of fetal thymic organ cultures (FTOC) with the specific CD10 (endopeptidase 24.11) inhibitors SCH 32615: (N-[L-(1-carboxy-2-phenyl)ethyl]-L-phenylalanyl-beta-alanine), RB25: (N-(3-[(hydroaxyamino)carbonyl]-2-benzylidene-1-oxopropyl]-N-glyci ne), and thymopentin (TP5) results in the inhibition of thymocyte differentiation. Each agent induces a significant decrease in the number of double positive (CD4+CD8+) cells in favor of the TN (TcR alpha beta-CD4-CD8-) population. RB25 also blocks T lymphocyte differentiation in FTOC when preinjected into pregnant mice. Finally, RB25 and TP5 were also shown to reduce the number of CD44+CD25- and CD44-CD25- thymocytes both in vitro and after preinjection in vivo in day 2 FTOC. Thus, agents that affect endopeptidase 24.11 activity impair T cell development both in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that the CD10 molecule plays a specific role in promoting early T cell development."

The results of Lalo et al. (15Lalo D. Carles C. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5524-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and Ulmasov et al. (6Ulmasov T.

In contrast to the above studies, in vivo labeling studies with yeast RNA polymerase II have indicated that the large α-like subunit, B44, is present at a stoichiometry of 2 (14Kolodziej P.A.

We have used a renaturation protocol with recombinant α-like subunits to determine which combinations of α-like subunits can form stable complexes in vitro. Here, we report on renaturation studies with yeast and Arabidopsis RNA polymerase II large and small α-like subunits that provide information on RNA polymerase class specificity, species specificity, and stoichiometry of subunit interactions. Plasmids encoding nuclear α-like RNA polymerase subunits lacking polyhistidine tags (His tags) were constructed by inserting ORFs 1The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; EST, expressed sequence tag; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. into the vector pET-16b (Novagen, Madison, WI) between NcoI and BamHI sites. The ORF encoding Arabidopsis AC14 was inserted into pET-16b in two steps. First, cDNA encoding amino acids 1–117 of AC14 was excised from a plasmid in which the first codon of the AC14 ORF was converted to a NcoI site 2R. Larkin, unpublished results. and the AC14 cDNA fragment was ligated into the NcoI site of pET-16b. Second, cDNA encoding amino acids 107–122 and the 3′-untranslated region of the Arabidopsis AC14 was excised from an EST clone (GenBank™ accession number Z25617) as anAflII-BamHI fragment. TheAflII-BamHI fragment was ligated into the partialArabidopsis AC14 in pET-16b construct between theAflII and BamHI sites. The ORFs encoding four different nuclear RNA polymerase subunits were amplified from cDNA clones using Pfu DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene, La Jolla CA) with the following oligonucleotides: CATGTCATGAATGCTCCAGACAGATTCG and TCAAAATGCGTCGTCGG for yeast B12.5 (3Woychik N.A. McKune K. Lane W.S. Young R.A. Gene Exp. 1993; 3: 77-82PubMed Google Scholar), GCCTCATGAATGCTCCCGAACGAT and TTAAAACTGATTCGAAAACTTGG for Arabidopsis B13.6 (6Ulmasov T. Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J.

Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5387-5394Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Using appropriate restriction endonucleases, the ORFs encoding the yeast B12.5,Arabidopsis B13.6, and Arabidopsis B36a subunits were inserted into pET-16b between the NcoI andBamHI sites. To obtain a plasmid encoding a full-length yeast B44 subunit, the ORF encoding this subunit was isolated using oligonucleotides GTCGTCTCATGAGTGAAGAAGGTCCTCAAG and CTACCAAGCATTATCATACCCTC with PCR-mediated amplification as described above. The PCR product was digested withBspHI, and the BspHI product encoding amino acids 1–37 of the yeast B44 subunit was inserted into pET-16b at theNcoI site. The pET-16b derivative containing the partial yeast B44 subunit ORF was digested with BamHI, filled in with Klenow, digested with SalI, and ligated to a PCR product containing the yeast B44 ORF that had been digested withSalI. To obtain a construct encoding the a polyhistidine-tagged (His-tagged) Arabidopsis AC42, the AC42 ORF (5Ulmasov T. Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 167: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides GGAATTCCATATGGTGACTAAAGCAGAAAAACA and TCAAAAGTCGGTTATAGCTTCAC withPfu DNA polymerase as described above. PCR products containing the Arabidopsis AC42 subunit ORF were ligated into pET-16b between NdeI and BamHI. Plasmids encoding the His-tagged Arabidopsis B36a, B36b, and AC43 and yeast B44 subunits were constructed using a similar strategy to that described above. NdeI sites were introduced at translational start codons using specific oligonucleotides and PCR. The large α-like subunit ORFs were inserted into pET-16b betweenNdeI and BamHI sites. Each plasmid was introduced into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and expressed using the procedure of Studier and Moffatt (27Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). Each recombinant RNA polymerase subunit accumulated as an insoluble product in E. coli. The insoluble products were partially purified using the methods of Borukhov and Goldfarb (28Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Exp. Purif. 1993; 4: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and dissolved in buffer B (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μmZnCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) (29Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In most experiments (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5), 500 μg of denatured, His-tagged large α-like subunit (Arabidopsis B36a, B36b, AC42, or AC43 or yeast B44) was mixed with a 5-fold molar excess of denatured small α-like subunit (Arabidopsis B13.6 or AC14, or yeast B12.5) and diluted to 0.5 mg/ml in buffer B. As controls to rule out nonspecific interaction of subunits with the Ni-NTA resin, the small α-like subunits were diluted to 0.5 mg/ml in buffer B without other α-like subunits and tested for binding on Ni-NTA columns (see below). In one set of experiments (Fig. 7, A and B), 250 μg of large α-like subunits that contained or lacked a His tag were mixed with a 5-fold molar excess of small α-like subunits and diluted to 0.5 mg/ml in buffer B. In another experiment (Fig. 7 C), approximately equal amounts of yeast B12.5 and His-tagged yeast B12.5 were mixed with 1 molar eq of yeast B44 and diluted to 0.5 mg/ml in buffer B. Renaturation was carried out by dialysis against 500 ml of buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μmZnCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) (29Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), followed by dialysis against two 500-ml changes of buffer D (buffer C lacking EDTA). Renatured subunits were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Clarified mixtures were applied to 0.5-ml columns containing Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA) that were equilibrated in buffer D. Columns were washed with 10 volumes of buffer D, followed with 10 volumes of buffer D containing 40 mmimidazole. Columns were eluted with buffer D containing 500 mm imidazole, and four drop fractions (0.2 ml) were collected. Eluted fractions were analyzed in 10% SDS gels (30Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10409) Google Scholar) or by gel filtration chromatography. Gel filtration chromatography was carried out by applying 200 μl of Ni-NTA eluted fractions to a 24-ml Superose 12 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that was equilibrated in buffer C containing 10% glycerol instead of 20% glycerol. Columns were run at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed in 10% SDS gels. Molecular mass was calculated as recommended by Stellwagen (31Stellwagen E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Figure 3Interactions between Arabidopsisand yeast RNA polymerase II α-like subunits.

These motifs consist of a 25-residue amino-terminal block of similarity and a 40-residue block of similarity that are separated by about 130 amino acids in the E. coli α subunit and by 140–200 amino acids in the eukaryotic large α-like subunits, but are juxtaposed in the eukaryotic small α-like subunits (Fig. 1). To determine if large and small α-like subunits interacted with themselves or with one another, we carried out renaturation experiments with recombinant large α-like subunits (36–44 kDa) and small α-like subunits (13–14 kDa) fromArabidopsis and yeast RNA polymerases using the methods described by Tang et al. (29Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The large RNA polymerase II α-like subunits that were tested included Arabidopsis B36a and B36b and yeast B44. The Arabidopsis B36a and B36b subunits are encoded by two different genes, and the B36a subunit is the predominant form of the large α-like subunit associated with purified RNA polymerase II (6Ulmasov T. Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5085-5094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The small RNA polymerase II α-like subunits that were analyzed consisted of Arabidopsis B13.6 and yeast B12.5. Recombinant α-like subunits expressed in E. coli were recovered as insoluble polypeptides in inclusion body fractions and solubilized in a denaturing buffer containing guanidine hydrochloride. Various combinations of denatured large and small α-like subunits were mixed together and renatured by dialysis against buffers that lacked guanidine hydrochloride. In these experiments, the large α-like subunit contained a His tag on the amino terminus, which facilitated purification of soluble, renatured subunits on Ni-NTA-agarose columns. The small α-like subunits lacked His tags and were retained on the Ni-NTA columns only if they formed stable complexes with the His-tagged large α-like subunits. When the Arabidopsis B13.6 subunit was subjected to the renaturation protocol, the subunit precipitated and little if any B13.6 subunit was retained in a soluble form (Fig.2 A). In contrast, the bulk of the His-taggedArabidopsis B36a (or B36b; data not shown) subunit remained soluble during the renaturation protocol and could be purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Fig. 2 B). Renaturation of the B13.6 subunit in the presence of either His-tagged B36a or B36b subunit resulted in a soluble form of B13.6 that bound to the Ni-NTA column along with the His-tagged B36a or B36b subunit (Fig. 2,C and D), suggesting that the B13.6 subunit formed a soluble, stable complex with the B36a or B36b subunit. Similar experiments were carried out with the yeast B44 and B12.5 subunits. In this case, however, the majority of the B12.5 subunit was recovered in the soluble fraction whether renatured in the absence or presence of the His-tagged B44 subunit (Fig. 2, E and F). The yeast His-tagged B44 subunit, like the ArabidopsisHis-tagged B36a or B36b subunit, remained soluble during the renaturation protocol and could be recovered by chromatography on the Ni-NTA resin (data not shown). The B12.5 subunit was not retained on the Ni-NTA column if renatured in the absence of the His-tagged B44 subunit (Fig. 2 E), but was retained on the nickel resin if renatured in the presence of the His-tagged B44 subunit (Fig.2 F). The results with yeast α-like subunits are consistent with the results obtained with the Arabidopsis α-like subunits and indicate a small α-like RNA polymerase II subunit forms a stable complex with a large α-like RNA polymerase II subunitin vitro. Another set of renaturation experiments was carried out to determine if the yeast small α-like subunit could stably associate with the Arabidopsis large α-like subunit and if the Arabidopsis small α-like subunit could stably associate with the yeast large α-like subunit. Results based upon the retention of small α-like subunits and His-tagged large α-like subunits on Ni-NTA columns presented in Fig. 3 indicate that yeast B12.5 forms stable complexes with ArabidopsisB36a (Fig. 3 A) and B36b (Fig. 3 B) and thatArabidopsis B13.6 forms stable complexes with yeast B44 (Fig. 3 C). The renaturation of solubleArabidopsis B13.6 appears to be less effective when carried out in the presence of the yeast B44 subunit, however, than renaturation in the presence of Arabidopsis B36a or B36b (compare Fig. 3 C t"
