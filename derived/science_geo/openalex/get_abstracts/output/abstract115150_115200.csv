https://openalex.org/W2116071714,"Adenovirus contains a heterodimeric protein complex consisting of 186 kd fiber protein that mediates high affinity virus attachment to cells and a 400 kd pentavalent subunit (penton base) that contains five Arg-Gly-Asp sequences, implying a role for integrins in adenovirus infection. We demonstrate that the vitro-nectin-binding integrins alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 5 promote viral infection in a novel way since antibodies against these receptors or soluble penton base block virus internalization without affecting attachment. Moreover, adenovirus binds to cultured cells lacking alpha v integrins but fail to become internalized, thus restricting infection of these cells. Transfection of alpha v(-) cells with a cDNA encoding alpha v results in the expression of integrins alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 5 and allows virus internalization and infection. These data indicate that adenovirus attachment and uptake into cells are separate but cooperative events that result from the interaction of distinct viral coat proteins with a receptor for attachment and alpha v integrin receptors for internalization."
https://openalex.org/W1977871027,"Yeast cells lacking a functional EST1 gene show progressive shortening of the terminal G1-3T telomeric repeats and a parallel increase in the frequency of cell death. Although the majority of the cells in an est1- culture die, a minor subpopulation survives the potentially lethal consequences of the est1 mutation. We show that these est1- survivors arise as a result of the amplification and acquisition of subtelomeric elements (and their deletion derivatives) by a large number of telomeres. Hence, even when the primary pathway for telomere replication is defective, an alternative backup pathway can restore telomere function and keep the cell alive."
https://openalex.org/W1544157645,"Prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PHS) catalyzes the committed step in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxane. We recently observed dissociation of PHS activity and enzyme mass measured in an immunoassay of endothelial cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor. These data and observations by others suggested that endothelial cells express an alternate PHS. We now report the molecular cloning of human PHS type II from an endothelial cell cDNA library. The protein encoded by this cDNA shares 61% identity with the human PHS I. Southern analysis demonstrated a single copy of PHS II and we found a polymorphism in approximately 5% of the population. PHS II mapped to chromosome 1, in contrast to PHS I, which is on chromosome 9. The PHS II cDNA hybridized strongly to a 4.3-kilobase (kb) message from endothelial cells. Stimulation of the cells with tumor necrosis factor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, lipopolysaccharide, or interleukin-1 increased mRNA levels for PHS II, and this change correlated well with increased prostacyclin biosynthesis. Cycloheximide induced PHS II mRNA without a corresponding activity increase demonstrating that translation of the 4.3-kb message is required for increased prostacyclin biosynthesis. We conclude that expression of PHS II may have important pathophysiological effects in the vasculature."
https://openalex.org/W1972036696,"To explore the physiological roles of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha), we disrupted the mouse gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Homozygous mutant mice were viable and fertile, but displayed pronounced waviness of the whiskers and fur, accompanied by abnormal curvature, disorientation, and misalignment of the hair follicles. Homozygous and, to a lesser extent, heterozygous mice displayed eye abnormalities of variable incidence and severity, including open eyelids at birth, reduced eyeball size, and superficial opacity. Histological examination revealed eyelid and anterior segment dysgenesis, corneal inflammation and scarring, and lens and retinal defects. Although TGF alpha deficiency affected skin and eyes, wound healing in these tissues was not impaired. Similar hair and eye defects have been previously associated with the recessive mutation waved-1 (wa-1), and Northern analysis revealed reduced expression of TGF alpha in wa-1 mice. Crosses between wa-1 homozygotes and TGF alpha-targeted mice confirmed that wa-1 and TGF alpha are allelic."
https://openalex.org/W2078458079,"Apoptosis plays an important role in regulating cell numbers in a wide variety of tissues during development. The product of the bcl-2 gene inhibits apoptosis in certain cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages and is expressed in many cells that have an extended life span. To assess the role of bcl-2 in neuronal apoptosis, we microinjected a bcl-2 expression vector into neurotrophic factor-deprived embryonic neurons. Sensory neurons that depend for survival on one or more members of the nerve growth factor family of neurotrophic factors (nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophin-3) were rescued by bcl-2, whereas ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)-dependent ciliary neurons were not. Sensory neurons, however, became refractory to bcl-2 after exposure to CNTF. These findings indicate that at least two death pathways operate in neurons that are distinguished by their susceptibility to bcl-2. Neurons may die by either pathway, depending on the factors to which they have been exposed."
https://openalex.org/W2099583536,"Mice homozygous for a disrupted transforming growth factor α (TGFα) gene are healthy and fertile, although some older mice show evidence of corneal inflammation. In contrast with TGFα +/− and +/+ animals, TGFα −/− mice have a pronounced waviness of the coat. Histological examination of the skin from TGFα −/− mice reveals a dramatic derangement of hair follicles. Mice with a disrupted TGFα gene also have curly whiskers, first evident on the day of birth. The phenotype of TGFα −/− mice is remarkably similar to that of the mouse mutant waved-1 (wa-1). Offspring resulting from crosses between TGFα −/− and wa-1 mice display the curly whisker-coat phenotype, indicating that the basis of the wa-1 phenotype is a mutation in the TGFα gene. These observations suggest that TGFα plays a pivotal role in determining skin architecture and in regulating hair development."
https://openalex.org/W2036817346,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a naturally occurring growth inhibitory polypeptide that arrests the cell cycle in middle to late G1 phase. Cells treated with TGF-beta contained normal amounts of cyclin E and cyclin-dependent protein kinase 2 (Cdk2) but failed to stably assemble cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes or accumulate cyclin E-associated kinase activity. Moreover, G1 phase extracts from TGF-beta-treated cells did not support activation of endogenous cyclin-dependent protein kinases by exogenous cyclins. These effects of TGF-beta, which correlated with the inhibition of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation, suggest that mammalian G1 cyclin-dependent kinases, like their counterparts in yeast, are targets for negative regulators of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2012959255,"Serum response factor (SRF) forms a ternary complex at the c-fos serum response element (SRE) with an accessory factor, Elk-1. We constructed altered-binding specificity derivatives of SRF and Elk-1 that form a ternary complex at a mutated, inactive SRE; like Elk-1, the Elk-1 variant only binds its target as part of a ternary complex with SRF. Simultaneous expression of these SRF and Elk-1 derivatives restores serum-regulated activity to the mutated SRE in transfected cells. Efficient transcriptional activation is dependent on the regulated phosphorylation of Elk-1 C-terminal MAP kinase sites and requires the C-terminal sequences of SRF as well as SRF sequences that mediate ternary complex formation. These experiments provide direct evidence that SRF and Elk-1 functionally cooperate in the ternary complex at the SRE to regulate transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2171838049,"A circadian oscillator that regulates visual function is located somewhere within the vertebrate eye. To determine whether circadian rhythmicity is generated by retinal photoreceptors, we isolated and cultured photoreceptor layers from Xenopus retina. On average, 94% of the viable cells in these preparations were rod or cone photoreceptors. Photoreceptor layers produced melatonin rhythmically, with an average period of 24.3 hr, in constant darkness. The phase of the melatonin rhythm was reset by in vitro exposure of the photoreceptor layers to cycles of either light or quinpirole, a D2 dopamine receptor agonist. These data indicate that other parts of the eye are not necessary for generation or entrainment of retinal circadian melatonin rhythms and suggest that rod and/or cone photoreceptors are circadian clock cells."
https://openalex.org/W2064230672,"The formation of knotted species on random ring closure of two DNAs that are 5.6 kilobase pairs (kbp) and 8.6 kbp in length was measured, and these data were used to calculate the effective DNA helix diameter as a function of sodium ion and magnesium ion concentration. In the presence of more than 50 mM magnesium ion, interactions between DNA segments appear to be attractive rather than repulsive. The free energy of formation of relaxed trefoil and figure-eight DNA knots and of supercoiled trefoil DNA knots was also evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W1607694174,"Post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have been shown to play a major role in gene expression in eukaryotic cells. The presence of a reiterated pentamer (AUUUA) in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs encoding lymphokines, cytokines, transcription factors, and proto-oncogenes has been shown to be associated with rapid turnover and translation attenuation. Cytoplasmic proteins (70, 50, 43, 36, and 25 kDa) capable of specifically binding to RNAs containing these AU-rich sequences were identified in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes. Levels of the 36-kDa protein were markedly increased following transcriptional, but not translational inhibition, a feature recently reported for hnRNP A1, a protein of comparable mass. Antibodies directed against heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A1 and C immunoprecipitated 36- and 43-kDa proteins that had bound the AUUUA-rich region contained in the 3'-UTR of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA. Recombinant hnRNP A1 was shown to preferentially bind to RNAs containing AUUUA sequences in a specific manner, and displayed comparable patterns to the 36-kDa AU-specific binding proteins following partial proteolysis. These data identify for the first time hnRNP A1 and C as cytoplasmic proteins in human lymphocytes that are capable of specifically associating with reiterated AUUUA sequences present in the 3'-UTR of labile mRNAs. As such, they may play a role as trans-acting factors in the modulation of cytoplasmic mRNA turnover and translation, in addition to their previously characterized roles as pre-mRNA binding proteins involved in nuclear mRNA processing."
https://openalex.org/W2035899716,"A primary neuronal cell culture derived from whole brains of fetal rats was used to analyze the subcellular localization of tau mRNA, employing nonisotopic detection by in situ hybridization. The culture exhibited a developmental differentiation pattern previously described for neuronal cells in vivo; i.e., a transition from immature to mature tau isoforms as well as segregation of tau into the axons. Our results demonstrate that unlike tubulin mRNA, which is confined to cell bodies, or MAP2 mRNA, which extends into dendrites, tau mRNA was observed to enter the proximal portion of the axon. This sorting of tau mRNA might explain how the tau protein could be selectively delivered to the axon and could have important implications for the development of neuronal polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2088262418,"A circadian clock regulates a number of diverse physiological functions in the vertebrate eye. In this study, we show that mRNA for the red-sensitive cone pigment, iodopsin, fluctuates with a circadian rhythm in chicken retina. Transcript levels increase in the late afternoon just prior to the time of cone disc shedding. Furthermore, iodopsin mRNA levels are regulated similarly by a circadian oscillator in primary cultures of dispersed embryonic chick retina. Nuclear run-on experiments show that the circadian regulation of iodopsin transcript abundance occurs at the level of gene transcription. Our results provide a demonstration of clock-regulated gene expression in a vertebrate preparation maintained in cell culture."
https://openalex.org/W1525502699,"Thus far, 16 distinct vertebrate collagens (types I-XVI) have been delineated. In this study, we have cloned a mouse collagenous protein, the 180-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPAG2). Isolation of over-lapping clones, together with 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends, allowed delineation of the entire coding sequence. The 5' and 3' ends of the mRNA transcripts were confirmed by primer extension and anchored reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses. The deduced polypeptide contained 1,433 amino acids, including a collagenous domain that consisted of 13 separate segments. Computer analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence demonstrated the presence of a membrane-associated segment. Examination of the 5' end of the BPAG2 gene revealed that the 295-base pair (bp) exon 1 contained two segments of (T)13AA and TT(A)11, whereas exon 2 was shown to contain the translation initiation codon. The 3' end of the mRNA transcript identified two 6-bp inverted repeat sequences that could form a stem for a 30-bp hairpin loop followed by a series of U residues. Comparison of mouse and human BPAG2 sequences demonstrated 86% homology and the unit of evolutionary period of 4.2 million years. In summary, we have cloned full-length mouse BPAG2 cDNA sequences that encode a collagenous polypeptide. We propose that this polypeptide be designated as the alpha 1-chain of type XVII collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1569667199,"Abstract Nonclaret disjunctional (ncd) is a kinesin-related microtubule motor protein that is required for proper chromosome distribution in Drosophila. Despite its sequence similarity to kinesin heavy chain, ncd translocates with the opposite polarity as kinesin, toward microtubule minus ends. We have expressed different regions of the protein in bacteria and analyzed the proteins for function. Results indicate that ncd consists of three domains: a basic, proline-rich N-terminal tail, a central alpha-helical coiled-coil stalk, and a C-terminal motor domain. The ncd N terminus proteins bundle microtubules in motility assays and show ATP-independent binding to microtubules in solution. Truncated proteins, lacking the tail but containing the predicted motor domain and differing lengths of the stalk, did not support microtubule gliding in in vitro assays but showed microtubule-stimulated MgATPase activity in solution. Addition of a nonspecific N terminus to two of the truncated proteins restored directional gliding and rotation of microtubules in motility assays, demonstrating that these properties map to the predicted mechanochemical domain of ncd. Physical properties of the C terminus proteins indicate that the stalk region is important for dimerization and that the ncd protein probably exists and functions as a dimer."
https://openalex.org/W2025735629,"The CD45 protein is a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase that is required for normal T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated signaling. A chimeric complementary DNA encoding the intracellular enzymatically active portion of murine CD45 preceded by a short amino-terminal sequence from p60c-src was transfected into CD45- T cells. Expression of this chimeric protein corrected most of the TCR signaling abnormalities observed in the absence of CD45, including TCR-mediated enhancement of tyrosine kinase activity and Ca2+ flux. Thus, the enzymatically active intracellular portion of CD45 is sufficient to allow TCR transmembrane signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1605551606,"The Fpg protein of Escherichia coli is a DNA repair enzyme with DNA glycosylase, abasic site nicking, and deoxyribose excising activities. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of this protein suggests that the Fpg protein is a zinc finger protein with a Cys-X2-Cys-X16-Cys-X2-Cys motif. Competition experiments show that the Fpg protein substitutes Cu(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II), metal ions classically associated with substitutions in zinc finger proteins. The Fpg protein activities are inhibited following the reaction with a Cys-specific reagent at low protein:reagent ratios, suggesting that these residues are important for the enzymatic activities. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to produce 6 mutant Fpg proteins with Cys-->Gly mutations. Substitution of the zinc in these proteins by 65Zn(II) indicates that all the proteins bind zinc, but the Zn(II) is not retained as strongly in the zinc finger mutants. The mutations in the Fpg protein outside the zinc finger consensus sequence do not eliminate the Fapy-DNA glycosylase and abasic site nicking. One of the Fpg mutant proteins outside the zinc finger has a reduced capacity to release deoxyribose from abasic sites. Cys-->Gly mutations in the zinc finger consensus sequence reduce all three aforementioned activities substantially. The purified Fpg proteins with Cys-->Gly mutations in the zinc finger consensus sequence do not incise DNA at abasic sites with the same efficiency nor mechanism as the native Fpg protein. The wild type Fpg protein and the Fpg proteins mutated outside the zinc finger sequence bind an oligonucleotide with a unique chemically reduced abasic site in a defined sequence as assayed by retention on nitrocellulose filters, whereas the mutant Fpg proteins within the zinc finger sequence do not bind to the same oligonucleotide. Therefore, the disruption of zinc coordination in the zinc finger of the Fpg protein is associated with decreased binding capacity to DNA as well as decreased enzymatic activities."
https://openalex.org/W2084234979,Transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) from Xenopus oocytes binds both the internal control region of the 5S ribosomal RNA genes and the 5S RNA transcript itself. The nucleic acid binding domain of TFIIIA contains nine tandemly repeated zinc finger motifs. A series of precisely truncated forms of this protein have been constructed and assayed for 5S RNA and DNA binding. Different sets of zinc fingers were found to be responsible for high affinity interactions with RNA and with DNA. These results explain how a single protein can exhibit equal affinities for these two very different nucleic acids.
https://openalex.org/W1597058403,"Liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy provides one of the few systems for analysis of mitogenesis in the fully developed, intact animal. Immediate-early growth response genes, induced in the absence of prior protein synthesis, play an important regulatory role in the regenerative process. During screening of a subtracted cDNA library of immediate-early genes induced during liver regeneration, a novel member of the thyroid/steroid receptor superfamily, RNR-1 (regenerating liver nuclear receptor), was identified. This gene is not expressed in quiescent liver but is rapidly induced following partial hepatectomy and is specific to hepatic growth as it is not induced in other mitogen-treated cells. RNR-1 is also expressed in brain. A full-length cDNA clone of RNR-1 encodes a 66-kDa, 597-amino acid protein as verified by in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysate. RNR-1 is highly homologous to r-NGFI-B/m-Nur77 particularly in the DNA binding (94%) and putative ligand binding (59%) domains. Using a mobility shift assay, we have shown that RNR-1 specifically binds to the NGFI-B DNA half-site and forms a complex very similar in size to the Nur77 complex, suggesting that RNR-1 also may bind as a monomer. Consistent with this finding, the A box region important in mediating half-site binding is 100% conserved between r-NGFI-B/m-Nur77. Both RNR-1 and Nur77 strongly transactivate a reporter driven by a consensus r-NGFI-B/Nur77 binding site, and their effect together is additive. As both the RNR-1 and r-NGFI/m-nur77 genes are induced during liver regeneration, it is very possible that RNR-1 acts concomitantly with r-NGFI/m-Nur77 in regulating the expression of delayed-early genes during liver regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1537309584,"Recently we reported the isolation of cDNAs for a number of genes that are differentially expressed between nonproliferating early (young) and late (senescent) population doubling level (PDL) WI-38 human, fetal lung-derived, fibroblast-like cells. We now demonstrate that one of these isolates, EPC-1 (early PDL cDNA-1), derives from an approximately 1.4-kilobase mRNA species that is expressed at a > or = 100-fold higher level in serum-starved, confluent, young versus similarly treated senescent WI-38 cells. Complete nucleotide sequence analysis of this cDNA confirms its identity with that of a cDNA encoding a secreted, retinal pigmented epithelium differentiation factor as well as similarity of the encoded protein with a number of mammalian serine protease inhibitors. We show that EPC-1 expression is associated with G0 growth arrest in WI-38 cells. The mRNA readily accumulates in density-arrested and/or serum-starved young cells but not in log phase, low density young cells. In contrast, EPC-1 transcript abundance and expression of the encoded, secreted protein are both negligible in senescent WI-38 cells under all culture conditions tested. These findings support the hypothesis that senescent WI-38 cells exhibit a state of growth arrest fundamentally distinct from that of quiescent (G0) young cells."
https://openalex.org/W2089322226,"Surface expression of the CD45 tyrosine phosphatase is essential for the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) to couple optimally with its second messenger pathways. CD45 may be required to dephosphorylate a TCR-activated protein tyrosine kinase, which then transduces an activation signal from the TCR. A chimeric molecule that contained extracellular and transmembrane sequences from an allele of a major histocompatibility class I molecule and cytoplasmic sequences of CD45 restored TCR signaling in a CD45-deficient mutant T cell line. Thus, expression of the complex extracellular domain of CD45 is not required for the TCR to couple to its signaling machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1591960484,"The circadian expressed luciferin-binding protein (LBP) gene from the marine bioluminescent alga Gonyaulax polyedra represents the first dinoflagellate gene that has been cloned and sequenced at both cDNA and genomic levels. Starting with a fragment from the 3'-end of the LBP cDNA that was found by immunoscreening of a cDNA library, genomic clones were obtained by the inverse polymerase chain reaction technique. Full-length cDNA clones were selected by screening a cDNA library by plaque hybridizations and by polymerase chain reaction amplifications. The LBP sequence has a 2004-nucleotide open reading frame coding for a protein of 668 amino acids (approximately 75 kDa). The reading frame and identity of the clone were confirmed by the sequence of an octapeptide obtained from a purified fragment of CNBr-treated LBP. A variant LBP cDNA was found to differ in sequence by approximately 11% at the DNA level. The untranslated regions of the mRNA are 111 nucleotides (5'-untranslated region) and 158 nucleotides (3'-untranslated region) long, respectively. The LBP gene contains no introns and exhibits certain features not typical for a eukaryotic gene. Its promoter does not include the typical TATA box within approximately 50 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site, and the usual poly(A+) signal (AAUAAA) is not present on the end of the LBP mRNA. The copy number of the gene is very high (approximately 1000 copies/cell). However, the universal genetic code and conserved positions relevant for the translational apparatus are maintained."
https://openalex.org/W1526685564,"Stable transfected baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing human alpha, beta, and gamma fibrinogen chains together, in various combinations of any two, or individually, were established. Several types of subunit interactions were observed in the intracellular extracts of the transfected BHK cell lines as well as in Hep G2 cells. These included: 1) formation of alpha gamma dimers linked by a disulfide bond(s), 2) formation of beta gamma dimers linked by a disulfide bond(s), 3) formation of alpha beta gamma half-molecules linked by disulfide bonds, and 4) formation of mature fibrinogen, which was also secreted into the cell culture medium. Analysis of the chain composition confirmed the stoichiometry of the alpha gamma, beta gamma, and alpha beta gamma complexes. These data are consistent with the proposal that the alpha gamma and beta gamma dimers as well as the alpha beta gamma half-molecules are intermediates in the assembly and biosynthesis of fibrinogen. In contrast, disulfide-linked alpha beta complexes were not found in transfected BHK cells or in Hep G2 cells, suggesting that the formation of disulfide bonds between these two chains most likely occurs when alpha beta gamma half-molecules are formed from alpha gamma and/or beta gamma complexes and when alpha beta gamma half-molecules dimerize to generate the mature molecule. Dimers, trimers, and larger oligomers of each individual chain linked by disulfide bonds were also identified when each chain was expressed in the absence of the other two chains. Preferential formation of alpha gamma and beta gamma complexes, rather than oligomers of individual chains, suggested that the oligomers were less likely to be intermediates in the assembly of fibrinogen. A model for fibrinogen assembly is presented based on these results."
https://openalex.org/W2082558717,"By using spinal cord neurons cultured in chemically defined medium, a double labeling procedure, and blockage with antisense oligonucleotides, we show that induction of c-fos and the subsequent transactivation of the prodynorphin gene are coupled events, triggered by serotonin1A receptor agonists. Addition of the specific 1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) to the culture, at concentrations similar to that needed for transactivation of the prodynorphin gene, also significantly increases cAMP levels. Furthermore, in rats depleted of serotonin by intrathecal administration of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, the induction of prodynorphin after noxious stimulation is dramatically decreased compared with the induction in sham-operated rats. These results suggest that the expression of the prodynorphin gene in spinal cord is under the control of the raphe-spinal efferents containing serotonin."
https://openalex.org/W1526532569,"Thrombospondin-1 (TS1) contains at least four domains that support cell attachment. The COOH-terminal cell binding domain (CBD) was first identified with a monoclonal antibody against TS1 that blocked secretion-dependent platelet aggregation. Subsequently, this domain of TS1 has been found to bind a number of normal and transformed cells. We have localized attachment sites for human melanoma cells (G361) within the CBD to two noncontiguous 30-residue peptides designated C4 and C7 (Kosfeld, M. D., and Frazier, W. A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16230-16236). Here we report studies to define the active sequences within C4 and C7. An octapeptide, RFYVVMWK (4N1-1), from C4 and a pentapeptide, IRVVM (7N3-1), from C7 were found to support attachment of G361 melanomas, K562 erythroleukemia cells, HT1080 fibrosarcomas, C32 amelanotic melanomas, and endothelial cells. These peptides also inhibit the adhesion of cells to the recombinant CBD of TS1. The hexapeptide RFYVVM (4N1-2) also inhibits cell attachment. The inhibitory effect of combinations of C4- and C7-derived peptides is synergistic. The sequences 4N1-1 and 7N3-1 of TS1 share homology with two cell adhesive peptides from laminin (LM), LMF9 and LMPA22-2, respectively. These TS1 and LM peptides are interchangeable in inhibiting the adhesion of G361 cells to LM or TS1, suggesting a possible sharing of receptors by LM and TS1. K562 cells, however, bound only to TS1, and this binding was inhibited preferentially by the TS1 CBD peptides, indicating a receptor specific for TS1 which does not recognize LM. The active TS1 peptides are highly conserved among five species and four isoforms of TS1. Homologs of the TS1 peptides are found in tenascin, a matrix protein that shares several properties with TS1 and in factor VIII, alpha 2-macroglobulin, and von Willebrand factor."
https://openalex.org/W1979626594,"We have constructed heterodimers consisting of two subunits: one CAP subunit that has a nonfunctional activating region but wild-type DNA binding specificity, and one CAP subunit that has a functional activating region but non-wild-type DNA binding specificity. We have oriented the heterodimers on lac promoter DNA by use of promoter derivatives that have DNA sites for CAP consisting of one wild-type half site and one non-wild-type half site, and we have analyzed the abilities of the oriented heterodimers to activate transcription. Our results indicate that transcription activation requires the activating region of only one subunit of CAP: the promoter-proximal subunit. The oriented heterodimers method of this report should be generalizable to other dimeric transcription activator proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1542795408,"nur77 is an immediate-early gene inducible by nerve growth factor or membrane depolarization in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 and by serum growth factors in fibroblasts. The nur77-encoded protein is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily and can act as a potent transcription activator. The induction of nur77 in PC12 cells is rapid and transient, with kinetics similar to those of the c-fos protooncogene. Induction does not require de novo protein synthesis. Whereas transcriptional activation of c-fos by nerve growth factor in PC12 cells requires a 20-base pair serum response element in its promoter, there is no such sequence in the nur77 promoter. To understand the mechanism for the activation of nur77, we have analyzed the inducibility of a series of transfected nur77 minigenes using an S1 nuclease protection assay. We identified the sequence 22-86 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site as necessary and sufficient for nur77 induction by nerve growth factor and membrane depolarization in PC12 cells. Sequences farther upstream enhance the induction. Analysis of base substitution mutations allowed us to identify three sequence elements within this region that are essential for induction. These sequence elements include two copies of an AP1-like element and a GC-rich sequence. Unlike transcriptional activation of c-fos, the sequence requirements for the activation of nur77 by nerve growth factor and membrane depolarization cannot be readily separated. Taken together, our data suggest that activation of nur77 and c-fos by nerve growth factor occurs through different mechanisms in PC12 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1581064242,"We have established an assay system where overexpression of a specific protein kinase C (PKC) type caused by introduction of the respective cDNA results in the enhancement of a cell response: the transcriptional activation of a set of genes in response to PKC activators such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). When monitored by the expression of a reporter gene containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene fused downstream of a synthetic TPA response element (TRE) or a serum response element (SRE), the overexpression of cPKC alpha and -beta II or nPKC epsilon all resulted in the enhancement of transcriptional activation through both TRE and SRE. On the other hand, PKC gamma activates TRE only very weakly, although it activates SRE in a similar manner to the other PKC members examined. The overexpression of cPKC alpha and -beta II or nPKC epsilon, but not cPKC gamma, resulted in the enhanced expression of the endogenous c-jun gene, which contains TRE in the 5'-upstream, promoter region. The gel mobility shift assay showed that the activation of PKC gamma, as well as PKC alpha and -beta II and nPKC epsilon, causes the increase in TRE-binding proteins, suggesting that transcriptional activation through TRE requires an additional step, which is not activated by PKC gamma, such as a qualitative change in TRE-binding or in TRE-associating proteins. This finding provides not only a rationale to explain the presence of multiple PKC family members, but also permits the dissection of the complex cellular signaling cascade involving PKC family members."
https://openalex.org/W1582365841,"We isolated and characterized four forms of rat CYP11B genes, which were tentatively named CYP11B1, -B2, -B3, and -B4. Genomic Southern analyses indicated that the members of the rat CYP11B gene subfamily were confined to these four genes; among them, CYP11B1 and -B2 encoded steroid 11 beta-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase, respectively, while CYP11B3 was a gene highly homologous to CYP11B1 without a known expression product. By being devoid of a region spanning two exons conserved in the other three, CYP11B4 was presumably a pseudogene. In the nucleotide sequences, CYP11B1, -B3, and -B4 showed 95-96 and 93-100% identities in the coding and 0.5-kilobase 5'-flanking regions, respectively. However, the homology between the nucleotide sequences of one of the three and CYP11B2 was rather low, about 90 and 50% in the coding and 0.5-kilobase 5'-flanking regions, respectively. As a whole, CYP11B2 rather than CYP11B1, -B3, or -B4 was more homologous to CYP11B genes of other animals such as cow and human. In transient transfection experiments using mouse adrenocortical Y1 cells and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene constructs, the 0.5-kilobase 5'-flanking region of CYP11B1 had a 4- and 10-fold higher promoter activity than the corresponding regions of CYP11B2 and -B3, respectively. The possible presence of a suppressive element(s) was noted in the upstream of the 0.5-kilobase region of CYP11B1. Although a variant of cAMP-responsive element, which was present in rat CYP11B2 and all known CYP11B genes of other animals, was modified in rat CYP11B1 and -B3 genes, dibutyryl cAMP stimulated all the promoter activities of the 5'-flanking regions of the rat genes by 3-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1549818014,"The PutA protein is both the put repressor and a membrane-bound enzyme with proline and delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase activities. The conditions required for association of purified PutA protein with membrane vesicles suggested that a redox switching mechanism might determine the proportion of PutA protein functioning as a dehydrogenase (Wood, J. M. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 373-377). The FAD cofactor was released from the PutA protein with 1 M KBr at neutral pH. The apoprotein retained delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase and DNA binding but not proline dehydrogenase activity. Reconstitution with FAD fully restored proline dehydrogenase activity. Proline at a concentration of 0.11 mM caused half-maximal bleaching of the FAD in PutA. Chymotryptic digestion of the PutA protein in the presence and absence of proline demonstrated that the persistence of a 119-kDa protein fragment was characteristic of the reduced protein. Identical digestion patterns were obtained from the apoprotein in the presence and absence of proline. The quantity of the 119-kDa fragment produced varied with proline concentration, yielding a midpoint of 0.056 mM proline. The fraction of PutA protein associated with membrane vesicles was also a function of proline concentration, yielding a titration midpoint of 0.10 mM proline. Membrane binding was thus coincident with both flavin reduction and a change in protein conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1536099429,"U937 cells produce eosinophil cytotoxicity-enhancing factor (ECEF) polypeptides of 14 and 10 kDa that have identical NH2-terminal amino acid sequences. The 10-kDa form has greater eosinophil-stimulating activity (half-maximal at > 20-fold lower concentration). We considered the hypothesis that there is a precursor-product relationship between the 14- and 10-kDa species. Recombinant 14-kDa 104-amino acid ECEF (rECEF-104) had a slight stimulatory effect on eosinophil cytotoxic function at concentrations of 160 nM and above. In contrast, two species, rECEF-80 and rECEF-84, representing cleavage products of approximately 10 kDa had substantial statistically significant cytotoxicity-enhancing activity at concentrations as low as 10 pM. This evidence demonstrates the potential to generate the high-activity ECEF species by proteolytic cleavage of the 104-amino acid species. Another feature of this cytokine is the sequence from amino acids 31 to 34, which constitutes the conserved and active site of the enzyme thioredoxin. When tested for dithiol reductase enzymatic activity, rECEF-104 was active in a dose- and time-dependent manner, whereas the truncated forms of the molecule had no dithiol reductase activity. Thus the eosinophil-stimulating functions of the molecule do not correlate with its enzymatic activity. The evidence shows that the enzymatic activity is not essential for the initial interaction of ECEF with the eosinophil, and it suggests that the ECEF molecule functions by means of two discrete mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1566541522,"Although ceruloplasmin is known to be a copper-transporting protein, little is known about the biochemical mechanisms of copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin during the biosynthesis. We have examined various levels of ceruloplasmin biosynthesis in the Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat, which possesses a mutation causing the deficiency in serum ceruloplasmin activity associated with excess hepatic copper accumulation. Southern and Northern blot analyses revealed that the gene and mRNA encoding ceruloplasmin resided normally in LEC rat liver. Western blot analysis showed a normal level of ceruloplasmin in LEC rat serum. Following metabolic labeling of hepatocytes with 64Cu, no radioactive copper was detected in the ceruloplasmin fraction in LEC rat hepatocytes using Sephadex G-75 column chromatography, indicating that copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin is deficient in the LEC rat. Furthermore, LEC rat hepatocytes incubated with 64Cu also showed a reduction in the efficiency of copper transport from cytosolic to noncytosolic fractions and a reduced copper efflux from the hepatocytes, indicating that LEC rat hepatocytes possess an abnormality in copper metabolism. These results suggest that an abnormality of the copper delivery mechanism causes an inhibition of copper incorporation into the ceruloplasmin molecule in the liver, leading to the deficiency in serum ceruloplasmin activity in the LEC rat. In addition, this abnormality also seems to cause an inhibition of biliary copper excretion. The blocking of these two copper exclusion pathways is thought to lead to excess hepatic copper accumulation in the LEC rat. Thus, the LEC rat should be a good model for studying the biochemical process responsible for copper delivery."
https://openalex.org/W1588860282,"Specific cDNA probes and antisera were employed to interpret genetic polymorphisms of human Mu-class glutathione S-transferases and to provide a basis for identifying individual forms in human tissues. A cDNA probe that cross-hybridized with various human and rodent Mu-glutathione S-transferase transcripts, hybridized with at least three discrete components by Northern analysis of RNA from human tissue. The smallest (1.3 kb) transcript was identified as the one that encodes GSTM3-3 subunits. A form designated GSTM5, was cloned from a human brain cDNA library and its sequence determined. The open reading frame of GSTM5 shared a high degree of homology with the sequences of other Mu-class glutathione S-transferases, but its 846-nucleotide 3'-noncoding region was unique and considerably larger than that of any of the other Mu forms. Specific synthetic peptide antigens were utilized to distinguish among Mu-class glutathione S-transferases in different tissues of representative individuals. The primary hepatic transcript was that encoding GSTM1-1 with much lesser amounts of GSTM3-3, but livers were devoid of GSTM2-2, and GSTM5-5. Immunoblots confirmed that null-phenotype individuals lacked the GSTM1 gene rather than its GSTM2 homologue that is nearly identical in its exon sequences. The null phenotype therefore was conspicuous in liver, where GSTM1-1 ordinarily was the predominant Mu transcript, but brain and testis contained all four forms. A general strategy was devised to distinguish among and assign primary structures to individual glutathione S-transferases from human tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2016960303,"Close axotomy of identified lamprey neurons induces phosphorylation of somatodendritic neurofilaments (NFs), followed by ectopic regeneration of neurofilamentous sprouts from the dendrites. We used in situ intracellular microinjection to study the mechanism of axotomy-induced NF phosphorylation. We found that inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A (PKA) block somatodendritic NF phosphorylation for up to 15 days when injected at the time of axotomy. Injection of PKA catalytic subunit, diacylglycerol, or okadaic acid induces somatodendritic NF phosphorylation in intact neurons with the same time course as close axotomy. These results suggest that transient activation of PKC, PKA, and/or serine phosphatase inhibition by axotomy triggers persistent intracellular changes that may be related to polarity loss in these neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1578244808,"The earliest biochemical event known to be associated with T cell receptor (TCR) engagement is the activation of a protein tyrosine kinase thought to be a member of the src family. Expression of CD45, the major receptor tyrosine phosphatase present on T cells, is required for efficient coupling between the TCR and its signaling machinery. One model to explain the role of CD45 in regulating TCR signaling is that the phosphatase dephosphorylates the regulatory C-terminal tyrosine of lck. In the present report we confirm the finding of a trimolecular complex containing CD45, lck, and a 34-kDa protein (p34) in the Jurkat T cell line. Additionally, we extend this work with the observation that specific in vitro kinase activity associated with CD45 requires the expression of lck in Jurkat-derived clones as does the in vivo phosphorylation of p34. The association between CD45 and lck is shown not to require the expression of or activation of the TCR. Finally, we demonstrate that even in the absence of lck p34 associates with CD45, implying a direct association between this molecule and the phosphatase. These data suggest strongly that lck is the relevant protein tyrosine kinase found in CD45 immunoprecipitates in the Jurkat T cell line and that there is an additional association between CD45 and p34 which does not require the presence of the protein tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2083691728,"Opioid peptides are abundantly expressed in the adrenal medulla, and there is evidence that they may be released presynaptically or as medullary paracrine agents. To assess the physiological relevance of these observations, we investigated opioid effects on ionic currents from cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. Under wholecell path-clamp conditions, opioid peptides, acting via a μ-type opioid receptor, strongly potentiated the large conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ (BK) channel current. Opioids also inhibited voltage-activated Ca2+ currents. Application of opioid peptides to the extracellular face of outside-out patches also increased opening activity of single BK channels, suggestive of tight receptor-channel coupling. This potentiating effect on BK current, combined with the inhibition of Ca2+ current, indicates that opioids may have an inhibitory influence on secretory activity of the adrenal medulla. The widespread distribution of the BK channel class suggests that the significance of its modulation by opioids could also extend beyond the adrenal gland."
https://openalex.org/W2006101370,"Previous studies have demonstrated that efficient splicing of the primary transcript of the yeast MER2 gene requires the MER1 protein, which is produced only in meiotic cells. A genetic selection was devised to recover second-site mutations that bypass the requirement for MER1 in MER2 RNA-splicing. This selection identified a mutation in SNR19, the gene for U1 snRNA. The suppressor mutation affects the first residue in U1 snRNA, allowing this nucleotide to base pair with the eighth nucleotide in the MER2 intron. This base in MER2 lies outside the conserved hexanucleotide that defines the 5' splice site in yeast. The MER2 5' splice site (GUUCGU) differs from the consensus in yeast (GUAYGU) at the third position. When this nucleotide is mutated to restore the consensus, base pairing with U1 snRNA is increased and the requirement for MER1 is alleviated."
https://openalex.org/W1533827100,"Clones referred to as ARD 1 were isolated from human and rat cDNA libraries. ARD 1 genes encode a putative 64-kDa protein that contains an 18-kDa ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) domain at the carboxyl terminus and is much larger than the other monomeric approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding ARF proteins thus far identified. ARD 1 mRNAs of 3.7 and 4.1 kilobases were detected in all rat tissues as well as in mouse and rabbit brain, human fibroblasts, and human neuroblastoma cells but not in HL-60 cells. Based on sequence identities, ARD 1 is highly conserved between rat and human. The ARF domain of ARD 1 contains the consensus sequences believed to be involved in guanine nucleotide binding, which are conserved in the ARFs and other GTP-binding proteins. Recombinant ARD 1 or the ARF domain of ARD 1, which lacks the 15 amino acids corresponding to the amino-terminal regions of ARFs stimulated, in a GTP-dependent manner, cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in the presence of 0.3% Tween 20. It had no effect in the presence of SDS, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/cholate, or cardiolipin. These observations are consistent with the conclusion that the amino-terminal region of ARF proteins is not required for activation of cholera toxin. In addition, the characteristic features of ARF proteins may be found as domains of larger mammalian proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2171601555,"Factor VIII functions as a component of the tenase enzyme complex upon phospholipid membranes. Factor VIII binds to phosphatidylserine-containing membranes and apparently provides high affinity binding sites for factor IXa upon these membranes. We have characterized the binding kinetics of human factor VIII with phosphatidylserine-containing membranes and directly compared the measured properties with those of factor V. The initial phase of association was evaluated in a stopped-flow apparatus by fluorescence energy transfer from aromatic residues in the protein to dansyl-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine in the vesicles. Association proceeded at an apparent second-order rate of 0.12 microM-1 s-1 for extruded phospholipid vesicles and 0.42 microM-1 s-1 for sonicated vesicles under pseudo-first-order conditions in which the phospholipid concentration determined the rate. Increased temperature resulted in more rapid association, and the effect decreased in the order extruded vesicles > sonicated vesicles > extruded vesicles of dioleoylphospholipids, indicating that the structure of the phospholipid membrane contributes to the activation energy of binding. The binding of fluorescein-labeled factor VIII to membranes supported on glass microspheres (lipospheres) was monitored by flow cytometry. Under conditions in which the factor VIII concentration determined the rate there was rapid initial association at 6.9 microM-1 s-1, accounting for half of the bound factor VIII, and a slower component of 0.87 microM-1 s-1, accounting for the other half. Likewise, the dissociation of factor VIII from liposphere membranes was biphasic with a faster component of 0.010 s-1 and a slower component of 0.0012 s-1. Rates of association and dissociation for factor V were similar to those for factor VIII and were biphasic. These results allow estimation of the size of the phospholipid sites that interact with factors VIII and V and suggest that both proteins bind to membranes via a multistep process in which rapid association is followed by a slower step yielding higher affinity binding."
https://openalex.org/W1587929792,"Stimulation of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) increased the initial rate of cytosolic phospholipase A2 activity by 95 +/- 6% over extracts from control cells. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 activity increased rapidly following PDGF treatment (near maximum stimulation by 2.5 min) and was dose-dependent (EC50 = 2 ng/ml). Epidermal growth factor, vasopressin, and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate also increased cytosolic phospholipase A2 activity but did not produce a sustained mobilization of arachidonic acid in these cells. Detailed kinetic analysis of PDGF-induced arachidonic acid mobilization revealed a biphasic release of 3H radioactivity into the extracellular medium. A first, rapid phase, occurred within 15 min which, like the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 activity, was independent of de novo RNA and protein synthesis. After 20 min of stimulation, a second phase became evident which accounts for the majority of arachidonic acid mobilized by PDGF. This second phase was abolished in the presence of either cycloheximide or actinomycin D. Both inhibitors blocked the release of arachidonic acid rather than inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity and consequently prostaglandin E2 production. These findings demonstrate a biphasic mobilization of arachidonic acid in Swiss 3T3 cells by PDGF. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 activity could contribute to the rapid first phase but not the second major phase, which is dependent upon de novo protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1529137549,"Molecular cloning of cytochrome P450(11 beta) cDNAs from the adrenal glands of Dahl's salt-sensitive hypertensive (DS) and salt-resistant normotensive (DR) rats was performed using a combined technique of the first strand cDNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase followed by polymerase chain reaction. The cDNA sequence of P450(11 beta)-DS was identical to that of wild type P450(11 beta). In contrast, the clone obtained from the DR rat contained six nucleotide substitutions causing five amino acid alterations (Arg-127-->Cys, Val-351-->Ala, Val-381-->Leu, Ile-384-->Leu, and Val-443-->Met). When the two cDNAs were expressed in COS-7 cells and steroid conversion rates of the transformed cells were determined, a ratio of 18-hydroxylation to 11 beta-hydroxylation of 11-deoxycorticosterone by P450(11 beta)-DS-expressed cells was 0.58, whereas that by P450(11 beta)-DR-expressed cells was 0.23. Plasma levels of 18-hydroxy-11-deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone (the 11 beta-hydroxylation product of 11-deoxycorticosterone) in DS and DR rats well reflected the steroidogenic activities of the two P450s. These results suggest that the characteristic plasma steroid level of the DR rat is caused by the mutations in P450(11 beta) gene and may act to maintain the normotensive blood pressure in this rat strain during sodium loading."
https://openalex.org/W1599895537,"Abstract While searching for an enzyme capable of breaking epsilon-(gamma-Glu)-Lys isopeptide bonds cross-linking protein chains, we purified a metallo-proteinase which mimics the action of an isopeptidase on the gamma-chain dimers of cross-linked fibrin. The enzyme is present in the growth medium of the bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila, isolated from the intestinal tract of the leech Hirudo medicinalis. It is a 19-kDa protein which specifically hydrolyzes the Gly-Ala peptide bond within the Gly-Gly-Ala sequence, located near the cross-link site in the gamma-chain dimer of fibrin. Substrate specificity studies with a number of synthetic peptides suggest that the enzyme prefers Gly-Gly or acetyl-Gly in the P2 and P1 positions, respectively (Schecter, I., and Berger, A. (1967) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 27, 157-162). Nonpolar amino acid residues seem to be favored in the P1' and P2' positions. The enzyme contains one atom of zinc and is inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline, but not by EDTA. Iodoacetate, leupeptin, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, and alpha 2-macroglobulin have no effect on enzyme activity. Disulfide reducing reagents, such as dithiothreitol or 2-mercaptoethanol, inactivate the enzyme completely. The partial amino-terminal sequence shows 46% identity with a zinc metallo-proteinase from a strain of Lysobacter enzymogenes and 69% identity with the LasA protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W1516944108,"We have isolated a number of mutants deficient in activity of the vacuolar hydrolase proteinase A (PrA). The mutations were sequenced and although they all map in the PEP4 gene, which encodes the precursor to PrA, three distinguishable phenotypes have surfaced. The properties of the pep4-7 missense mutant suggested that the activation of the precursor to proteinase A is due to an autocatalytic cleavage. PrA active site mutations were constructed and resulted in accumulation of PrA antigen in the inactive precursor form. Although protease B (PrB), another vacuolar hydrolase, is not required for the production of active PrA, the active form of PrA that accumulates in a strain lacking PrB is larger than that found in a strain containing active PrB. We have purified this larger form of PrA and determined that it bears 7 additional amino acids at its NH2 terminus. It has become apparent from all the studies performed on the maturation pathway of the vacuolar hydrolases that there is a great deal of redundancy built into the system."
https://openalex.org/W1565052686,"Antithrombin-III (AT-III) is a heparin-dependent inhibitor of thrombin and Factor Xa, two serine proteases that are crucial for blood coagulation. In order to assess whether it would be possible to target AT-III only towards Factor Xa, we replaced parts of the reactive site, or P region, of AT-III by sequences present in prothrombin, a substrate of Factor Xa in the coagulation cascade. We show that replacement of the P3 to P3' region generates the hypothesized phenotype. In fact, point mutation of the P1' site from Ser (present in AT-III) to Ile (present in prothrombin) is sufficient to dissociate heparin-dependent thrombin and Factor Xa inhibitory activities. Interestingly, a combined mutation at P3 and P3' brings about the same dissociation. We show that besides Ile, other amino acids at P1' can lead to the dissociation in inhibitory activity. Amino acids with small side chains (Gly, Ser, Ala, and Thr) have only a marginal effect on the inhibitory activity against either protease. However, larger residues at the P1' position abolish the heparin-dependent anti-thrombin activity, whereas the heparin-dependent anti-Factor Xa activity is not at all or only moderately affected. These results can be rationalized by a comparison of the x-ray structure and a three-dimensional model of the S1' binding pockets of thrombin and Factor Xa, respectively. It appears that the S1' pocket of Factor Xa leaves much more space for the P1' residue of AT-III than the S1' pocket of thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1585646667,"Activation of (2'-5') A synthetase gene expression in interleukin-6 (IL-6)-treated myeloleukemic M1 cells correlates with protein binding to the interferon response sequence enhancer (IRS). A new interferon response sequence complex, F6, is induced by IL-6 independently of interferon and is identified here as comprising the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and IRF-2, by use of specific antibodies in DNA mobility shift assays with probes containing IRF binding sites. IRF-1 and IRF-2 have, respectively, positive and negative transcriptional effects on interferon-beta and interferon-inducible genes. In the IL-6-treated M1or cells, IRF-1 binding is activated early and maximally at 1 h, whereas the onset of IRF-2 binding is delayed. In a cell variant M1res, where (2'-5') A synthetase is no more induced, IRF-2 binding is constitutive, and IRF-1 binding is not seen before or after IL-6 treatment. In sensitive M1or cells, IL-6 rapidly induces IRF-1 mRNA, but in M1res cells, IRF-1 mRNA is constitutively high and not changed by IL-6. IRF-2 mRNA levels are also constitutive and not inducible by IL-6 even in M1or cells. The dissociation between induction of mRNAs and of protein binding observed suggests that the activity of the IRF proteins is regulated by IL-6. Transcripts of a third member of the IRF gene family, ICSBP, encoding a protein known to act as repressor, were found to be strongly down-regulated by IL-6. The rapid activation of IRF-1 and the modulation of the other transcription factors of this family may play a role in the early phase of IL-6 action on the M1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1570298666,"In addition to thyroglobulin, primary thyrocytes secrete into the culture medium significant quantities of p500, a protein so named because of its M(r) > or = 500,000. Epithelial monolayers cultured on porous filters serve as a useful model system in which to study protein secretion. From these monolayers, thyroglobulin, the precursor in thyroid hormonogenesis, was released with apical predominance, while p500 was found mostly in the basolateral medium. Thyrocyte exposure to thyrotropin augmented selectively thyroglobulin but not p500 production. By contrast, exposure to cycloheximide actually augmented p500 production, a response observed for immediate-early proto-oncogenes. Using thyrocyte conditioned medium, the p500 protein was purified to homogeneity. Peptide sequencing of tryptic fragments of purified p500 showed identity to thrombospondin. Immunoprecipitation of thrombospondin from media bathing primary thyrocytes and the FRTL5 cell line quantitatively recovered p500, confirming its identity and indicating an epithelial origin. Gel filtration of secreted thrombospondin eluted at a high molecular weight, suggesting complexation with components of the extracellular matrix. Further, immunofluorescence showed cellular codistribution of thrombospondin and thyroglobulin, although thrombospondin exhibited predominantly an extracellular, basolateral deposition. It seems likely that thrombospondin production by thyrocytes plays a role in the growth or development of the thyroid epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W1599787697,Activation of the weak PRM promoter by cI protein is an essential process in the establishment of lysogeny. Much evidence has accumulated that cI protein binds cooperatively to the operators OR1 and OR2 and that protein at the OR2 site contacts RNA polymerase to facilitate open complex formation at the PRM promoter. We had shown previously in vitro that RNA polymerase situated at the nearby PR promoter could interfere with open complex formation at PRM and that an additional mechanism of PRM activation in vitro involved cI-mediated RNA polymerase exclusion from PR. Here we further characterize this second indirect mode of activation. We demonstrate the addition of cI and inactivation of the PR promoter activate open complex formation at PRM similarly over the temperature range from 37 to 20 degrees C in which the extent of activation decreases from 8- to 2-fold. We also show that the binding of cI protein to OR1 is sufficient to effect an increase in the rate of synthesis of abortive RNA products at PRM. This result is difficult to explain based on direct cI-RNA polymerase contacts alone but is readily interpreted in terms of our previously proposed model involving the exclusion of an interfering RNA polymerase from binding at PR.
https://openalex.org/W1493512542,"Abstract Expression of collagen IV genes is developmentally regulated and cell type-specific. To identify transcriptional control elements for the mouse alpha 2(IV) collagen gene, several promoter constructs were transiently transfected into mouse PYS-2 (parietal yolk sac) cells. Within the 5.5-kb (kilobase) upstream and 8.5-kb downstream sequences from the transcription start site, we have identified several regulatory active regions. Here, we report characterization of the most proximal 0.3-kb enhancer found at 4.5-kb upstream of the alpha 2(IV) collagen gene. This enhancer is transcriptionally active in cells that make collagen IV such as PYS-2 cells and differentiated F9 cells, but has little if any activity in cells that do not make collagen IV including NIH 3T3 cells and undifferentiated F9 embryonal carcinoma stem cells. This enhancer, linked to the herpes simplex virus TK gene promoter, confers a cell type-specific and differentiation-induced expression on the TK gene as well. Mutational and 5' and 3' deletion analysis demonstrate that this enhancer activity requires two identical response elements (GAACAAT) present in the 0.3-kb enhancer sequence. In gel shift assay, the GAACAAT element forms a complex that is specific for cells that make collagen IV."

Steady state kinetic parameters, effects of pH, salts, and inhibition constants of several anti-folates have been determined."
https://openalex.org/W1935171583,"Sperm whale apomyoglobin was complexed with iron porphine to examine the influence of completely removed heme side chains on the entire molecular structure. Paramagnetic NMR peak from the proximal histidine of the deoxy protein ensured formation of the iron-histidine bond. Porphine pyrrole-proton NMR signals of the cyanmet and deoxy derivatives are unusually sharp single lines manifesting rapid heme rotation about the iron-histidine bond. X-ray crystallographic structure of the cyanmet derivative, determined with a final R factor of 0.21 for 11,808 independent reflections ranging from 7 to 1.8 A, was resolved at 1.8 A resolution. The result confirmed 1:1 coupling between apomyoglobin and iron porphine. The cyano ligand adopts a bent configuration with an Fe-C-N angle of 127 degrees and a Fe-CN distance of 1.89 A. The overall globin structure and side chain conformations are remarkably similar to those of native myoglobin despite intensive disruption of the original heme-globin interactions. The native apoprotein structure unexpectedly conserved even after iron porphine insertion demonstrates that the complex polypeptide fold of holomyoglobin is more inherent in the amino acid sequence than is generally believed."
