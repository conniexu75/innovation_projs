https://openalex.org/W2148312526,"Choanoflagellates are the closest known relatives of metazoans. To discover potential molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of metazoan multicellularity, we sequenced and analysed the genome of the unicellular choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis. The genome contains approximately 9,200 intron-rich genes, including a number that encode cell adhesion and signalling protein domains that are otherwise restricted to metazoans. Here we show that the physical linkages among protein domains often differ between M. brevicollis and metazoans, suggesting that abundant domain shuffling followed the separation of the choanoflagellate and metazoan lineages. The completion of the M. brevicollis genome allows us to reconstruct with increasing resolution the genomic changes that accompanied the origin of metazoans. The genome sequence of the marine choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis has now been determined. Choanoflagellates are a mainly sessile group of protozoa resembling the 'feeding cells' of sponges, and are considered to be the closest living unicellular relatives of multicellular animals. Comparison of the M. brevicollis sequence with metazoan genomes suggests that the last unicellular ancestor of animals had intron-rich genes, some encoding protein domains characteristically associated with cell adhesion and the extracellular matrix in animals. This organism is strictly unicellular, but other choanoflagellates form colonies and may provide clues as to the origin of cell signalling and other systems in early metazoans."

https://openalex.org/W2013767143,"A principal question in MAP kinase (MAPK/MPK) cascade signalling is how similar components dictate different specificity in the information-processing machineries from yeast to humans and plants. In Arabidopsis, how MPK3/6 modulates distinct outputs in diverse signal transduction pathways remains elusive. By combining systematic cellular and genetic screens, here we uncover a previously unexpected MKK9–MPK3/MPK6 cascade promoting ethylene-insensitive 3 (EIN3)-mediated transcription in ethylene signalling. The mkk9 mutant exhibits a broad spectrum of moderate ethylene-insensitive phenotypes, and translocated MKK9 governs nuclear signalling downstream of receptors. Breaking a linear model and conventional MAPK signalling, ethylene inactivates the negative regulator constitutive triple response 1 (CTR1, a Raf-like MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK)) to activate the positive MKK9–MPK3/6 cascade. The bifurcate and antagonistic CTR1 and MKK9 pathways are both critical in determining ethylene-signalling specificity through two MAPK phosphorylation sites with opposite effects on EIN3 stability. The results suggest a new paradigm for linking intertwined MAPK cascades to control quantitative responses and specificity in signalling networks. Ethylene gas is a major plant hormone, regulating germination, fruiting and other essential processes. Previous work identified a linear pathway in which five ethylene receptors converge on a single negative regulator, CTR1, and two key downstream components, EIN2 and EIN3. It remained a mystery how CTR1 regulates the downstream positive regulators. Now a previously unknown mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway involving MKK9 has been identified in Arabidopsis, acting positively to control EIN3-mediated transcription in ethylene signalling. Together, the antagonistic roles of CTR1 and MKK9 may determine ethylene-signalling specificity and quantitative responses via two MAPK phosphorylation sites with opposite effects on EIN3 stability."

https://openalex.org/W2110719003,"Transcriptional activation of cytokines, such as type-I interferons (interferon (IFN)-α and IFN-β), constitutes the first line of antiviral defence. Here we show that translational control is critical for induction of type-I IFN production. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking the translational repressors 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2, the threshold for eliciting type-I IFN production is lowered. Consequently, replication of encephalomyocarditis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus and Sindbis virus is markedly suppressed. Furthermore, mice with both 4E- and 4E-BP2 genes (also known as Eif4ebp1 and Eif4ebp2, respectively) knocked out are resistant to vesicular stomatitis virus infection, and this correlates with an enhanced type-I IFN production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and the expression of IFN-regulated genes in the lungs. The enhanced type-I IFN response in 4E-BP1-/- 4E-BP2-/- double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts is caused by upregulation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (Irf7) messenger RNA translation. These findings highlight the role of 4E-BPs as negative regulators of type-I IFN production, via translational repression of Irf7 mRNA. Transcriptional control of interferon-mediated gene expression plays a major role in the activation of the innate immune response, but little is known about the role of translational control — the control exerted at the stage at which mRNA is converted into a protein. Colina et al. show that in mice lacking the translational repressors 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2, the threshold for eliciting type-I interferon in response to challenge by various viruses is lowered and virus replication is dramatically suppressed. The 4E-BP repressors appear to act by the synthesis of the protein IRF-7, the master regulator of interferon production. By targeting 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 with drugs, it may be possible to boost innate immunity against virus infection. Production of type-I interferon is regulated by the transcription factor IRF-7. This paper shows that IRF-7 is negatively regulated by translational repressor proteins 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2. Viral infection promotes mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of the repressor proteins and allows type-I interferon production to proceed."
https://openalex.org/W1982451112,"Leptospira biflexa is a free-living saprophytic spirochete present in aquatic environments. We determined the genome sequence of L. biflexa, making it the first saprophytic Leptospira to be sequenced. The L. biflexa genome has 3,590 protein-coding genes distributed across three circular replicons: the major 3,604 chromosome, a smaller 278-kb replicon that also carries essential genes, and a third 74-kb replicon. Comparative sequence analysis provides evidence that L. biflexa is an excellent model for the study of Leptospira evolution; we conclude that 2052 genes (61%) represent a progenitor genome that existed before divergence of pathogenic and saprophytic Leptospira species. Comparisons of the L. biflexa genome with two pathogenic Leptospira species reveal several major findings. Nearly one-third of the L. biflexa genes are absent in pathogenic Leptospira. We suggest that once incorporated into the L. biflexa genome, laterally transferred DNA undergoes minimal rearrangement due to physical restrictions imposed by high gene density and limited presence of transposable elements. In contrast, the genomes of pathogenic Leptospira species undergo frequent rearrangements, often involving recombination between insertion sequences. Identification of genes common to the two pathogenic species, L. borgpetersenii and L. interrogans, but absent in L. biflexa, is consistent with a role for these genes in pathogenesis. Differences in environmental sensing capacities of L. biflexa, L. borgpetersenii, and L. interrogans suggest a model which postulates that loss of signal transduction functions in L. borgpetersenii has impaired its survival outside a mammalian host, whereas L. interrogans has retained environmental sensory functions that facilitate disease transmission through water."

https://openalex.org/W2110741244,"The development of complex tissues requires that mitotic progenitor cells integrate information from the environment. The highly varied outcomes of such integration processes undoubtedly depend at least in part upon variations among the gene expression programs of individual progenitor cells. To date, there has not been a comprehensive examination of these differences among progenitor cells of a particular tissue. Here, we used comprehensive gene expression profiling to define these differences among individual progenitor cells of the vertebrate retina. Retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) have been shown by lineage analysis to be multipotent throughout development and to produce distinct types of daughter cells in a temporal, conserved order. A total of 42 single RPCs were profiled on Affymetrix arrays. In situ hybridizations performed on both retinal sections and dissociated retinal cells were used to validate the results of the microarrays. An extensive amount of heterogeneity in gene expression among RPCs, even among cells isolated from the same developmental time point, was observed. While many classes of genes displayed heterogeneity of gene expression, the expression of transcription factors constituted a significant amount of the observed heterogeneity. In contrast to previous findings, individual RPCs were found to express multiple bHLH transcription factors, suggesting alternative models to those previously developed concerning how these factors may be coordinated. Additionally, the expression of cell cycle related transcripts showed differences among those associated with G2 and M, versus G1 and S phase, suggesting different levels of regulation for these genes. These data provide insights into the types of processes and genes that are fundamental to cell fate choices, proliferation decisions, and, for cells of the central nervous system, the underpinnings of the formation of complex circuitry."

https://openalex.org/W2016212358,"Background We investigated whether there had been an improvement in quality of reporting for randomised controlled trials of acupuncture since the publication of the STRICTA and CONSORT statements. We conducted a before-and-after study, comparing ratings for quality of reporting following the publication of both STRICTA and CONSORT recommendations. Methodology and Principal Findings Ninety peer reviewed journal articles reporting the results of acupuncture trials were selected at random from a wider sample frame of 266 papers. Papers published in three distinct time periods (1994–1995, 1999–2000 and 2004–2005) were compared. Assessment criteria were developed directly from CONSORT and STRICTA checklists. Papers were independently assessed for quality of reporting by two assessors, one of whom was blind to information which could have introduced systematic bias (e.g. date of publication). We detected a statistically significant increase in the reporting of CONSORT items for papers published in each time period measured. We did not, however, find a difference between the number of STRICTA items reported in journal articles published before and 3 to 4 years following the introduction of STRICTA recommendations. Conclusions and Significance The results of this study suggest that general standards of reporting for acupuncture trials have significantly improved since the introduction of the CONSORT statement in 1996, but that quality in reporting details specific to acupuncture interventions has yet to change following the more recent introduction of STRICTA recommendations. Wider targeting and revision of the guidelines is recommended."

https://openalex.org/W2105437577,"RNA helicases represent a large family of proteins implicated in many biological processes including ribosome biogenesis, splicing, translation and mRNA degradation. However, these proteins have little substrate specificity, making inhibition of selected helicases a challenging problem. The prototypical DEAD box RNA helicase, eIF4A, works in conjunction with other translation factors to prepare mRNA templates for ribosome recruitment during translation initiation. Herein, we provide insight into the selectivity of a small molecule inhibitor of eIF4A, hippuristanol. This coral-derived natural product binds to amino acids adjacent to, and overlapping with, two conserved motifs present in the carboxy-terminal domain of eIF4A. Mutagenesis of amino acids within this region allowed us to alter the hippuristanol-sensitivity of eIF4A and undertake structure/function studies. Our results provide an understanding into how selective targeting of RNA helicases for pharmacological intervention can be achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2090376117,"Non-coding CUG repeat expansions interfere with the activity of human Muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins contributing to myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). To understand this toxic RNA gain-of-function mechanism we developed a Drosophila model expressing 60 pure and 480 interrupted CUG repeats in the context of a non-translatable RNA. These flies reproduced aspects of the DM1 pathology, most notably nuclear accumulation of CUG transcripts, muscle degeneration, splicing misregulation, and diminished Muscleblind function in vivo. Reduced Muscleblind activity was evident from the sensitivity of CUG-induced phenotypes to a decrease in muscleblind genetic dosage and rescue by MBNL1 expression, and further supported by the co-localization of Muscleblind and CUG repeat RNA in ribonuclear foci. Targeted expression of CUG repeats to the developing eye and brain mushroom bodies was toxic leading to rough eyes and semilethality, respectively. These phenotypes were utilized to identify genetic and chemical modifiers of the CUG-induced toxicity. 15 genetic modifiers of the rough eye phenotype were isolated. These genes identify putative cellular processes unknown to be altered by CUG repeat RNA, and they include mRNA export factor Aly, apoptosis inhibitor Thread, chromatin remodelling factor Nurf-38, and extracellular matrix structural component Viking. Ten chemical compounds suppressed the semilethal phenotype. These compounds significantly improved viability of CUG expressing flies and included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (ketoprofen), muscarinic, cholinergic and histamine receptor inhibitors (orphenadrine), and drugs that can affect sodium and calcium metabolism such as clenbuterol and spironolactone. These findings provide new insights into the DM1 phenotype, and suggest novel candidates for DM1 treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2008209433,"Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) is expressed in a range of clinical complications that include increased disease severity in pregnant women, decreased fetal viability, intra-uterine growth retardation, low birth weight and infant mortality. The physiopathology of malaria in pregnancy is difficult to scrutinize and attempts were made in the past to use animal models for pregnancy malaria studies. Here, we describe a comprehensive mouse experimental model that recapitulates many of the pathological and clinical features typical of human severe malaria in pregnancy. We used P. berghei ANKA-GFP infection during pregnancy to evoke a prominent inflammatory response in the placenta that entails CD11b mononuclear infiltration, up-regulation of MIP-1 alpha chemokine and is associated with marked reduction of placental vascular spaces. Placenta pathology was associated with decreased fetal viability, intra-uterine growth retardation, gross post-natal growth impairment and increased disease severity in pregnant females. Moreover, we provide evidence that CSA and HA, known to mediate P. falciparum adhesion to human placenta, are also involved in mouse placental malaria infection. We propose that reduction of maternal blood flow in the placenta is a key pathogenic factor in murine pregnancy malaria and we hypothesize that exacerbated innate inflammatory responses to Plasmodium infected red blood cells trigger severe placenta pathology. This experimental model provides an opportunity to identify cell and molecular components of severe PAM pathogenesis and to investigate the inflammatory response that leads to the observed fetal and placental blood circulation abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W2131209803,"In bacteria, OxyR is a peroxide sensor and transcription regulator, which can sense the presence of reactive oxygen species and induce antioxidant system. When the cells are exposed to H(2)O(2), OxyR protein is activated via the formation of a disulfide bond between the two conserved cysteine residues (C199 and C208). In Deinococcus radiodurans, a previously unreported special characteristic of DrOxyR (DR0615) is found with only one conserved cysteine. dr0615 gene mutant is hypersensitive to H(2)O(2), but only a little to ionizing radiation. Site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent in vivo functional analyses revealed that the conserved cysteine (C210) is necessary for sensing H(2)O(2), but its mutation did not alter the binding characteristics of OxyR on DNA. Under oxidant stress, DrOxyR is oxidized to sulfenic acid form, which can be reduced by reducing reagents. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR and global transcription profile results showed that OxyR is not only a transcriptional activator (e.g., katE, drb0125), but also a transcriptional repressor (e.g., dps, mntH). Because OxyR regulates Mn and Fe ion transporter genes, Mn/Fe ion ratio is changed in dr0615 mutant, suggesting that the genes involved in Mn/Fe ion homeostasis, and the genes involved in antioxidant mechanism are highly cooperative under extremely oxidant stress. In conclusion, these findings expand the OxyR family, which could be divided into two classes: typical 2-Cys OxyR and 1-Cys OxyR."
https://openalex.org/W2090357006,"Kawasaki Disease (KD) is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed nations. The KD etiologic agent is unknown but likely to be a ubiquitous microbe that usually causes asymptomatic childhood infection, resulting in KD only in genetically susceptible individuals. KD synthetic antibodies made from prevalent IgA gene sequences in KD arterial tissue detect intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (ICI) resembling viral ICI in acute KD but not control infant ciliated bronchial epithelium. The prevalence of ICI in late-stage KD fatalities and in older individuals with non-KD illness should be low, unless persistent infection is common.Lung tissue from late-stage KD fatalities and non-infant controls was examined by light microscopy for the presence of ICI. Nucleic acid stains and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed on tissues that were strongly positive for ICI. ICI were present in ciliated bronchial epithelium in 6/7 (86%) late-stage KD fatalities and 7/27 (26%) controls ages 9-84 years (p = 0.01). Nucleic acid stains revealed RNA but not DNA within the ICI. ICI were also identified in lung macrophages in some KD cases. TEM of bronchial epithelium and macrophages from KD cases revealed finely granular homogeneous ICI.These findings are consistent with a previously unidentified, ubiquitous RNA virus that forms ICI and can result in persistent infection in bronchial epithelium and macrophages as the etiologic agent of KD."
https://openalex.org/W2082005220,"Background Mechanical ventilation causes ventilator-induced lung injury in animals and humans. Mitogen-activated protein kinases have been implicated in ventilator-induced lung injury though their functional significance remains incomplete. We characterize the role of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/mitogen activated protein kinase kinase-3 and c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase-1 in ventilator-induced lung injury and investigate novel independent mechanisms contributing to lung injury during mechanical ventilation. Methodology and Principle Findings C57/BL6 wild-type mice and mice genetically deleted for mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-3 (mkk-3−/−) or c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase-1 (jnk1−/−) were ventilated, and lung injury parameters were assessed. We demonstrate that mkk3−/− or jnk1−/− mice displayed significantly reduced inflammatory lung injury and apoptosis relative to wild-type mice. Since jnk1−/− mice were highly resistant to ventilator-induced lung injury, we performed comprehensive gene expression profiling of ventilated wild-type or jnk1−/− mice to identify novel candidate genes which may play critical roles in the pathogenesis of ventilator-induced lung injury. Microarray analysis revealed many novel genes differentially expressed by ventilation including matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP8) and GADD45α. Functional characterization of MMP8 revealed that mmp8−/− mice were sensitized to ventilator-induced lung injury with increased lung vascular permeability. Conclusions We demonstrate that mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways mediate inflammatory lung injury during ventilator-induced lung injury. C-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase was also involved in alveolo-capillary leakage and edema formation, whereas MMP8 inhibited alveolo-capillary protein leakage."
https://openalex.org/W2153369969,"Oil palm cultivation is frequently cited as a major threat to tropical biodiversity as it is centered on some of the world's most biodiverse regions. In this report, Web of Science was used to find papers on oil palm published since 1970, which were assigned to different subject categories to visualize their research focus. Recent years have seen a broadening in the scope of research, with a slight growth in publications on the environment and a dramatic increase in those on biofuel. Despite this, less than 1% of publications are related to biodiversity and species conservation. In the context of global vegetable oil markets, palm oil and soyabean account for over 60% of production but are the subject of less than 10% of research. Much more work must be done to establish the impacts of habitat conversion to oil palm plantation on biodiversity. Results from such studies are crucial for informing conservation strategies and ensuring sustainable management of plantations."
https://openalex.org/W2083346530,"Omission of extracellular Ca(2+) for 15 min from the incubation medium of cultured hippocampal slices stimulated the efflux of glutathione, phosphoethanolamine, hypotaurine, and taurine. The efflux was reduced by several blockers of gap junctions, i.e. carbenoxolone, flufenamic acid, and endothelin-1, and by the connexin43 hemichannel blocking peptide Gap26 but was unchanged by the P2X(7) receptor inhibitor oxidized ATP, a pannexin1 hemichannel blocking peptide and an inactive analogue of carbenoxolone. Pretreatment of the slices with the neurotoxin N-methyl-d -aspartate left the efflux by Ca(2+) omission unchanged, indicating that the stimulated efflux primarily originated from glia. Elevated glutamate efflux was detected when Ca(2+) omission was combined with the glutamate uptake blocker l-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate and when both Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) were omitted from the medium. Omission of Ca(2+) for 15 min alone did not induce delayed toxicity, but in combination with blocked glutamate uptake, significant cell death was observed 24 h later. Our results indicate that omission of extracellular Ca(2+) stimulates efflux of glutathione and specific amino acids including glutamate via opening of glial hemichannels. This type of efflux may have protective functions via glutathione efflux but can aggravate toxicity in situations when glutamate reuptake is impaired, such as following a stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2079752769,"Background Birth asphyxia kills 0.7 to 1.6 million newborns a year globally with 99% of deaths in developing countries. Effective newborn resuscitation could reduce this burden of disease but the training of health-care providers in low income settings is often outdated. Our aim was to determine if a simple one day newborn resuscitation training (NRT) alters health worker resuscitation practices in a public hospital setting in Kenya. Methods/Principal Findings We conducted a randomised, controlled trial with health workers receiving early training with NRT (n = 28) or late training (the control group, n = 55). The training was adapted locally from the approach of the UK Resuscitation Council. The primary outcome was the proportion of appropriate initial resuscitation steps with the frequency of inappropriate practices as a secondary outcome. Data were collected on 97 and 115 resuscitation episodes over 7 weeks after early training in the intervention and control groups respectively. Trained providers demonstrated a higher proportion of adequate initial resuscitation steps compared to the control group (trained 66% vs control 27%; risk ratio 2.45, [95% CI 1.75–3.42], p<0.001, adjusted for clustering). In addition, there was a statistically significant reduction in the frequency of inappropriate and potentially harmful practices per resuscitation in the trained group (trained 0.53 vs control 0.92; mean difference 0.40, [95% CI 0.13–0.66], p = 0.004). Conclusions/Significance Implementation of a simple, one day newborn resuscitation training can be followed immediately by significant improvement in health workers' practices. However, evidence of the effects on long term performance or clinical outcomes can only be established by larger cluster randomised trials. Trial Registration Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN92218092"
https://openalex.org/W2168091002,"Type Ia supernovae are exploding stars used to measure the expansion of the Universe. They are important to us as they are responsible for the production of most of the iron in the Universe. Exactly what object is exploding and why is unclear — though a white dwarf in a binary system is the likely candidate — and indirect methods of identifying progenitors have failed. Rasmus Voss and Gijs Nelemans now report the direct observation of a progenitor of a supernova that exploded on 5 November 2007. They unearthed an object in the exact position of supernova 2007on in images taken by the Chandra X-ray telescope four years before the explosion. Deep optical images from the archives show nothing in this position. This seems to favour the accretion model for this supernova, where a white dwarf accretes material from a companion star, rather than a merger of two white dwarfs. Type Ia supernovae are exploding stars that are used to measure the accelerated expansion of the Universe1,2 and are responsible for most of the iron ever produced3. Although there is general agreement that the exploding star is a white dwarf in a binary system, the exact configuration and trigger of the explosion is unclear4, which could hamper their use for precision cosmology. Two families of progenitor models have been proposed. In the first, a white dwarf accretes material from a companion until it exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass, collapses and explodes5,6. Alternatively, two white dwarfs merge, again causing catastrophic collapse and an explosion7,8. It has hitherto been impossible to determine if either model is correct. Here we report the discovery of an object in pre-supernova archival X-ray images at the position of the recent type Ia supernova (2007on) in the elliptical galaxy NGC 1404. Deep optical images (also archival) show no sign of this object. From this we conclude that the X-ray source is the progenitor of the supernova, which favours the accretion model for this supernova, although the host galaxy is older (6–9 Gyr) than the age at which the explosions are predicted in the accreting models."
https://openalex.org/W2075189867,"How information transmission processes between individuals are shaped by natural selection is a key question for the understanding of the evolution of acoustic communication systems. Environmental acoustics predict that signal structure will differ depending on general features of the habitat. Social features, like individual spacing and mating behavior, may also be important for the design of communication. Here we present the first experimental study investigating how a tropical rainforest bird, the white-browed warbler Basileuterus leucoblepharus, extracts various information from a received song: species-specific identity, individual identity and location of the sender. Species-specific information is encoded in a resistant acoustic feature and is thus a public signal helping males to reach a wide audience. Conversely, individual identity is supported by song features susceptible to propagation: this private signal is reserved for neighbors. Finally, the receivers can locate the singers by using propagation-induced song modifications. Thus, this communication system is well matched to the acoustic constraints of the rain forest and to the ecological requirements of the species. Our results emphasize that, in a constraining acoustic environment, the efficiency of a sound communication system results from a coding/decoding process particularly well tuned to the acoustic properties of this environment."
https://openalex.org/W2085418023,"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is required for the hepatic assembly and secretion of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The LDL receptor (LDLR) promotes post-translational degradation of apoB and thereby reduces VLDL particle secretion. We investigated the trafficking pathways and ligand requirements for the LDLR to promote degradation of apoB. We first tested whether the LDLR drives apoB degradation in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated pathway. Primary mouse hepatocytes harboring an ethyl-nitrosourea-induced, ER-retained mutant LDLR secreted comparable levels of apoB with LDLR-null hepatocytes, despite reduced secretion from cells expressing the wild-type LDLR. Additionally, treatment of cells with brefeldin A inhibited LDLR-dependent degradation. However, this rescue was reversible, and degradation of apoB occurred upon removal of brefeldin A. To characterize the lipoprotein reuptake pathway of degradation, we employed an LDLR mutant defective in constitutive endocytosis and internalization of apoB. This mutant was as effective in reducing apoB secretion as the wild-type LDLR. However, the effect was dependent on apolipoprotein E (apoE) as only the wild-type LDLR, and not the endocytic mutant, reduced apoB secretion in apoE-null cells. Treatment with heparin rescued a pool of apoB in cells expressing the endocytic mutant, indicating that reuptake of VLDL via apoE still occurs with this mutant. Finally, an LDLR mutant defective in binding apoB but not apoE reduced apoB secretion in an apoE-dependent manner. Together, these data suggest that the LDLR directs apoB to degradation in a post-ER compartment.

Initial mechanistic studies have suggested that the LDLR operates through rapid reuptake of nascent VLDL particles (12Twisk J. Gillian-Daniel D.L. Tebon A. Wang L. Barrett P.H. Attie A.D. J. Clin.

Chem. 1990; 265: 16741-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a process similar to the LDLR-mediated internalization of LDL, as well as through a direct intracellular targeting of nascent VLDL particles to degradation (12Twisk J.

Tall A.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In the current study, we addressed two questions. First, we asked whether the LDLR acts on apoB in the ER or at a post-ER step in the secretory pathway. Second, we studied the ligand requirements for LDLR-mediated reuptake of VLDL particles. We show that LDLR-dependent apoB degradation occurs after exit from the ER and that it involves both of the LDLR ligands on the VLDL particle, apoB and apoE. We also show that an FH LDLR mutant defective in constitutive endocytosis is still capable of mediating the reuptake of VLDL via a recently described, non-canonical endocytic mechanism (17Jones C.

This study sheds light on general mechanisms of LDLR-mediated degradation of apoB and specifically predicts pathways by which an FH LDLR mutant may regulate VLDL secretion. Mice and Hepatocyte Isolation—Wild-type (C57BL/6J), C678Y (HLB301), Ldlr-/- (Ldlrtm1Her), and apoE-/- (apoEtm1Unc) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred in our animal care facility. Mice were weaned at 3–4 weeks of age, fed standard chow and water ad libitum, and housed on a 12-h dark/light cycle. Mice were sacrificed between 8 and 18 weeks of age for hepatocyte isolation. Hepatocytes were isolated by liver perfusion as described previously (11Teusink B. Mensenkamp A.R. van der Boom H. Kuipers F. van Dijk K.W. Havekes L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40693-40697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy, cells were plated in low glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin, l-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) at a density of 3.6 × 105 cells/well on collagen-coated coverslips (BD Biosciences) in 6-well plates. For all other applications, cells were plated at a density of 0.8 × 106 cells/dish in collagen-coated 60-mm dishes (BD Biosciences). Cells not infected with virus were used within 16 h. Generation of Tetracycline-inducible Adenoviral Vectors—A reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter was cut from pWHE146 (19Urlinger S. Baron U.

A minimal cytomegalovirus promoter with seven repeats of the tetracycline operator (tet-on promoter) was cut from pUHC13-3 (20Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar) (also kindly supplied by Wolfgang Hillen) with XhoI and BamHI and inserted into the XhoI/BamHI site of pVQ Ad5 K-NpA (ViraQuest). LacZ was cut from pVQ AdRSV ntLacZ (ViraQuest) with HindIII and SpeI and inserted into the HindIII and SpeI site of pVQ Ad5 K-NpA downstream of the tet-on promoter. LDLR mutants were created by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type (WT) LDLR (12Twisk J. Gillian-Daniel D.L. Tebon A. Wang L. Barrett P.H. Attie A.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the pCI vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The LDLR cDNAs were cut from pCI with NheI and XbaI and inserted into the XbaI site of pVQ Ad5 K-NpA downstream of the tet-on promoter. The pVQ E3 3.1 Δ XbaI shuttle containing the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator and the pVQ Ad5 K-NpA shuttles containing the operators and genes of interest were combined by Viraquest to generate tetracycline-inducible adenoviral vectors. Adenoviral Infection—Four hours after isolation, hepatocytes were washed once in supplemented DMEM without fetal bovine serum and then infected in the same medium containing virus at the indicated concentrations for 2 h. Infected cells were incubated overnight in supplemented DMEM with 10% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum (Clontech) and re-fed the following day with the same medium. All viral expression experiments were performed ∼40 h after isolation and 36 h after infection. Western Blots and Confocal Microscopy—Western blots were performed as described (12Twisk J. Gillian-Daniel D.L. Tebon A. Wang L. Barrett P.H. Attie A.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that proteins were transferred to Westran S polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ) and probed with a polyclonal rabbit anti-LDLR antibody (1:500). The anti-LDLR antibody was generated with a truncated LDLR containing the first 354 amino acids of the N terminus (21Dirlam K.A. Gretch D.G. LaCount D.J. Sturley S.L. Attie A.D. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 489-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To detect protein localization by immunofluorescence, hepatocytes were fixed, permeabilized, stained, and mounted as described previously (22Nassoury N. Blasiole D.A. Tebon Oler A. Benjannet S. Hamelin J. Poupon V. McPherson P.S. Attie A.D. Prat A. Seidah N.G. Traffic. 2007; 8: 718-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The antibodies and stains used were polyclonal anti-LDLR (1:300), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated concanavalin A (50 μg/ml, Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA), 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and donkey anti-rabbit IgG-Rhodamine Red-X (1:200, Jackson Immuno-Research, Bar Harbor, ME). For antibody internalization experiments, cells were incubated with cold supplemented DMEM containing polyclonal anti-LDLR antibody (1:300) on ice for 1 h. The cells were either washed once with cold medium and fixed immediately with 2% paraformaldehyde or re-fed with warm medium and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min before fixation. All cells were then stained with donkey anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:200, Jackson Immuno-Research, Bar Harbor, ME) and mounted according to the standard protocol (above). Confocal microscopy was performed with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U laser-scanning microscope with 408-, 488-, and 543-nm laser lines. Images were processed with Adobe PhotoShop CS2, version 9.0 (Adobe, San Jose, CA). Protein Secretion Assays—Hepatocytes were starved for 1 h in supplemented methionine and cysteine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) without serum. For continuous labeling experiments, cells were incubated in starve medium supplemented with l-[35S]methionine/cysteine (100 μCi/dish, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h before harvesting cells and media. For pulse-chase experiments, cells were incubated with 200 μCi/dish [35S]methionine/cysteine for 1 h, washed with DMEM supplemented with 10 mm unlabeled cysteine and methionine, and chased for the indicated times in the same medium. Brefeldin A (BFA, Epicenter, Madison, WI) was dissolved in water and added to the chase medium at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Heparin (Sigma) was dissolved in water and added to the labeling medium at a final concentration of 6 mg/ml. Cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitations for apoB and albumin were performed from media and cell lysates as described (12Twisk J. Gillian-Daniel D.L. Tebon A. Wang L. Barrett P.H. Attie A.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies used for apoB and albumin immunoprecipitations were polyclonal rabbit anti-pig LDL (12Twisk J. Gillian-Daniel D.L. Tebon A. Wang L. Barrett P.H. Attie A.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and polyclonal rabbit anti-human albumin (Sigma), respectively. Immunoprecipitated, radiolabeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, detected by autoradiography with a PhosphorImager screen followed by scanning with a Typhoon 9410 variable mode imager, and quantitated with ImageQuant TL v2002.01 (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). In experiments testing endogenous genetic effects, apoB values were normalized by albumin values to correct for differences in hepatocyte isolation efficiencies and specific activity of incorporated 35S among cell types. In experiments testing effects of virally expressed proteins, values were normalized by cell protein (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data were expressed in mean arbitrary units and show the standard error. Student's t test was performed to determine differences between two treatment conditions. One-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's protected test of least significant difference (LSD) were performed to determine differences among multiple treatment conditions. The LDLR Regulates apoB Secretion through a Post-ER Mechanism—Our laboratory previously reported that transfection of cDNAs encoding ER-retained LDLR mutants reduced apoB secretion to the same extent as those expressing the WT LDLR (13Gillian-Daniel D.L. Bates P.W. Tebon A. Attie A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4337-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This suggested that the LDLR directs apoB to degradation through an ER-associated pathway. To test this result in a more physiological system, we used a newly generated hypercholesterolemic mouse obtained from an ethyl-nitrosourea mutagenesis screen with high throughput phenotyping (24Svenson K.L. Von Smith R. Magnani P.A. Suetin H.R. Paigen B. Naggert J.K. Li R. Churchill G.A. Peters L.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2007; 102: 2369-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The hypercholesterolemia in this mouse results from a mutation in the Ldlr gene leading to a C678Y amino acid substitution (numbering excludes the 21-amino-acid signal peptide). 4The Jackson Laboratory Stock Number 005061. To determine whether the mouse C678Y LDLR mutation confers ER retention, we blotted for the LDLR with lysates from primary hepatocytes derived from WT, mutant, and Ldlr-/- mice. The WT LDLR migrated at ∼150 kDa (Fig. 1A), which is characteristic of the mature, fully glycosylated receptor. By contrast, the C678Y mutant migrated at ∼100 kDa (Fig. 1A), which is characteristic of the newly synthesized, immature form of the receptor. Glycosylation of the LDLR occurs after exit from the ER, in the Golgi (26Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. Schneider W.J. Hobgood K.K. Tolleshaug H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15261-15273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the increased mobility of the mutant LDLR suggests that it is retained in the ER. To verify ER retention, we immunostained the LDLR and determined its subcellular localization with confocal microscopy. The LDLR in the WT cells showed punctate staining, largely in the periphery but also in the interior of the cells, which did not overlap with the ER marker, concanavalin A (Con A) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the C678Y mutant showed a reticular staining pattern, which completely overlapped with the ER marker. To assess whether the ER-retained LDLR mutant reduces apoB secretion, we determined the secreted protein levels from primary hepatocytes isolated from WT, C678Y, and Ldlr-/- mice. Hepatocytes from WT, but not the C678Y mice, secreted less apoB-100 and apoB-48 than Ldlr-/- hepatocytes (Fig. 1C). Since the ER-retained LDLR was unable to decrease apoB secretion, this suggests that the LDLR-dependent regulation of apoB secretion requires exit of the LDLR from the ER. To determine whether retention of both the LDLR and apoB in the ER affects degradation of apoB, we investigated the effect of BFA on LDLR-dependent apoB degradation. BFA is a fungal metabolite that reversibly blocks anterograde transport of secretory cargo from the ER (27Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Notably, BFA does not inhibit the ER-associated degradation of apoB observed in some cell types (28Sato R. Imanaka T. Takatsuki A. Takano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11880-11884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wu X. Sakata N. Lele K.M. Zhou M. Jiang H. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11575-11580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We employed adenoviral vectors expressing genes of interest in a tetracycline-inducible manner. This viral system allowed for a low basal level of LDLR expression in uninduced conditions, indicated by the ratio of the 100-kDa band (ER pool) relative to the 150-kDa band (post-ER pool, supplemental Fig. S1A), and enabled 90–95% infection efficiency (supplemental Fig. S1B). To establish a baseline of LDLR activity with this system in the absence of BFA, we infected Ldlr-/- mouse hepatocytes with adenoviral vectors to express β-galactosidase (Ad-β-Gal) or the wild-type human LDLR (Ad-LDLR-WT) in uninduced conditions. We radiolabeled the infected cells for 1 h and chased with cold medium for 2 h. The presence of the LDLR resulted in a reduction in total recovered apoB-100 (cellular and secreted) and a trend toward a reduction in apoB-48 (Fig. 2A), indicating that degradation of apoB occurred in the presence of the LDLR. To determine the effect of BFA, we chased the cells in the presence of BFA for 2 h after labeling and then further chased for an additional 3 h in the absence of BFA to reverse the effects. Treatment with BFA increased cellular levels of apoB-100, apoB-48, and albumin (not shown), indicating that BFA indeed blocked transport from the ER. Importantly, the cellular levels of apoB did not differ between the β-Gal- and LDLR-expressing cells treated with BFA (Fig. 2B, left panels). However, removal of BFA during the second chase revealed an LDLR-dependent decrease in total (cellular and secreted) apoB-100 and apoB-48 (Fig. 2B, right panels). These results support a lack of an LDLR-dependent effect on apoB in the ER and suggest that exit from the ER is required for LDLR-mediated apoB degradation. An LDLR Mutant Defective in Constitutive Endocytosis Reduces apoB Secretion as Effectively as the Wild Type—We next investigated mechanisms of LDLR-mediated apoB degradation downstream of ER exit, specifically those involving reuptake through endocytosis (12Twisk J. Gillian-Daniel D.L. Tebon A. Wang L. Barrett P.H. Attie A.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Williams K.J. Brocia R.W. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16741-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We employed an LDLR mutant, the “JD” LDLR (30Davis C.G. Lehrman M.A. Russell D.W. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1986; 45: 15-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), which has a substitution of cysteine for the critical tyrosine (Tyr-807) in the FDNPVY sequence in the C-terminal tail. This peptide signal is required for the constitutive endocytic activity responsible for internalization and degradation of apoB-containing lipoproteins in immortalized cells (30Davis C.G. Lehrman M.A. Russell D.W. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1986; 45: 15-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 31Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1976; 9: 663-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To verify that the JD LDLR is also defective in endocytosis in our primary hepatocyte system, we expressed the WT and JD LDLR with adenoviral vectors in Ldlr-/- hepatocytes and stained the LDLR to determine its steady-state localization. As with the endogenous mouse LDLR (Fig. 1B), the virally expressed WT LDLR showed punctate localization in both the periphery and the interior of the cell (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the JD LDLR was highly enriched at the cell surface and showed relatively little intracellular localization (Fig. 3A). To obtain a functional readout of the endocytic activity of the JD LDLR, Ldlr-/- hepatocytes expressing the WT or JD LDLR were incubated with a polyclonal anti-LDLR antibody on ice to allow for binding at the cell surface. The cells were then either immediately fixed or warmed to 37 °C for 10 min to allow for internalization of the bound antibody. Cells expressing the WT and JD LDLR both showed the presence of the antibody at the cell surface prior to warming (Fig. 3B, 0 min). However, only cells expressing the WT LDLR showed significant internalization of the antibody from the cell surface (Fig. 3B, 10 min). Identical results were observed with the C7 monoclonal anti-LDLR antibody (not shown). These data show that the JD LDLR is defective in constitutive endocytosis in primary hepatocytes. We hypothesized that the JD LDLR would be at least partially defective in regulating apoB secretion due to its defect in endocytosis. To test this hypothesis, we compared the secretion of apoB among Ldlr-/- hepatocytes expressing various levels of WT LDLR, JD LDLR, and β-Gal. Surprisingly, both the WT and the JD LDLR induced dose-dependent reductions in apoB-100 secretion (Fig. 4A). Importantly, similar levels of LDLR expression of the variants (Fig. 4A, inset, WT versus JD+) led to comparable reductions in apoB100 secretion. To verify that the JD LDLR is functional in promoting degradation of apoB, we performed a pulse-chase analysis. As with the WT LDLR (Fig. 2, A and B), cells expressing the JD LDLR showed a reduction in the recovery of total apoB-100 and apoB-48 (Fig. 4B). These data reveal that despite the defect in constitutive endocytic activity, the JD LDLR is effective in regulating apoB secretion. apoE Mediates the JD LDLR-dependent Reduction in apoB Secretion—The ability of the JD LDLR to regulate apoB secretion suggests that the process is independent of endocytosis. However, recently published data provide another potential explanation. ARH is an LDLR-specific clathrin adaptor that binds to the LDLR at the FDNPVY peptide sequence to mediate its endocytosis (32He G. Gupta S. Yi M. Michaely P. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44044-44049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 33Mishra S.K. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 29024-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The Y807C substitution in the JD LDLR disrupts this interaction (32He G. Gupta S. Yi M. Michaely P. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44044-44049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which accounts for its loss in constitutive endocytic activity in hepatocytes. However, recent studies show that despite a defect in the internalization of apoB-containing lipoproteins, Arh-/- hepatocytes and JD LDLR fibroblasts both maintain the ability to internalize apoE (17Jones C. Garuti R. Michaely P. Li W.P. Maeda N. Cohen J.C. Herz J. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Michaely P. Zhao Z. Li W.P. Garuti R. Huang L.J. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3273-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that the JD LDLR may regulate apoB secretion through reuptake of VLDL via apoE. To test this hypothesis, we compared the secretion of apoB from apoE-/- hepatocytes ectopically expressing the WT or JD LDLR. No receptor-dependent effects were observed with apoB-48 (not shown). However, expression of the WT LDLR lowered apoB-100 secretion (Fig. 5A), suggesting that at least a portion of apoB degradation occurs through a direct interaction with the LDLR. By contrast, expression of the JD LDLR was completely ineffective in reducing apoB-100 secretion (Fig. 5A). These data indicate that the ability of the JD LDLR to reduce apoB secretion from hepatocytes with an intact apoE gene results from binding to apoE on the VLDL particle. The previous experiment suggests that apoE is the ligand responsible for the ability of the JD LDLR to regulate apoB secretion. To determine whether this regulation occurs through lipoprotein reuptake, as our hypothesis predicts, we tested the effect of heparin on the ability of the JD LDLR to regulate apoB secretion.

https://openalex.org/W1994153334,"The NFkappaBs regulate an array of physiological and pathological processes, including propagation of mitochondrial respiratory stress signaling in mammalian cells. We showed previously that mitochondrial stress activates NFkappaB using a novel calcineurin-requiring pathway that is different from canonical or non-canonical pathways. This study shows that IkappaBbeta is essential for the propagation of mitochondrial stress signaling. Knock down of IkappaBbeta, but not IkappaBalpha, mRNA reduced the mitochondrial stress-mediated activation and nuclear translocation of cRel:p50, inhibiting expression of nuclear target genes RyR1 and cathepsin L. IkappaBbeta mRNA knock down also reduced resistance to staurosporine-induced apoptosis and decreased in vitro invasiveness. Induced receptor switching to insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and increased glucose uptake are hallmarks of mitochondrial stress. IkappaBbeta mRNA knock down selectively abrogated the receptor switch and altered tubulin cytoskeletal organization. These results show that mitochondrial stress signaling uses an IkappaBbeta-initiated NFkappaB pathway that is distinct from the other known NFkappaB pathways. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the distinctive physiological roles of the two inhibitory proteins IkappaBbeta and IkappaBalpha."
https://openalex.org/W2053462962,"Growing evidence supports the importance of ubiquitin ligases in the pathogenesis of muscular disorders, although underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here we show that the expression of RNF5 (aka RMA1), an ER-anchored RING finger E3 ligase implicated in muscle organization and in recognition and processing of malfolded proteins, is elevated and mislocalized to cytoplasmic aggregates in biopsies from patients suffering from sporadic-Inclusion Body Myositis (sIBM). Consistent with these findings, an animal model for hereditary IBM (hIBM), but not their control littermates, revealed deregulated expression of RNF5. Further studies for the role of RNF5 in the pathogenesis of s-IBM and more generally in muscle physiology were performed using RNF5 transgenic and KO animals. Transgenic mice carrying inducible expression of RNF5, under control of beta-actin or muscle specific promoter, exhibit an early onset of muscle wasting, muscle degeneration and extensive fiber regeneration. Prolonged expression of RNF5 in the muscle also results in the formation of fibers containing congophilic material, blue-rimmed vacuoles and inclusion bodies. These phenotypes were associated with altered expression and activity of ER chaperones, characteristic of myodegenerative diseases such as s-IBM. Conversely, muscle regeneration and induction of ER stress markers were delayed in RNF5 KO mice subjected to cardiotoxin treatment. While supporting a role for RNF5 Tg mice as model for s-IBM, our study also establishes the importance of RNF5 in muscle physiology and its deregulation in ER stress associated muscular disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1985922066,"Background Tamoxifen is still the most widely used drug in hormone therapy for the treatment of breast cancer. Its benefits in adjuvant treatment are well documented in controlled and randomized clinical studies, which have demonstrated an increase in disease-free intervals of patients with positive hormonal receptors. However, the mechanisms involved in endocrine resistance are not clear. Laboratory and clinical data now indicate that bi-directional molecular cross-talk between nuclear or membrane ER and growth factor receptor pathways may be involved in endocrine resistance. We recently found a functional interaction between α6β4 integrin and ErbB-3 receptor to maintain the PI3K/Akt survival pathway of mammary tumour cells. We sought to improve understanding of this process in order to provide the involvement of both receptors insight into mechanism of Tamoxifen resistance. Methods and Findings Using human breast cancer cell lines displaying different levels of α6β4 and ErbB-3 receptors and a series of 232 breast cancer biopsies from patients submitted to adjuvant Tamoxifen monotherapy for five years, we evaluated the functional interaction between both receptors in relationship to Tamoxifen responsiveness. In mammary carcinoma cells, we evidenced that the α6β4 integrin strongly influence Akt phosphorylation through ErbB-3 protein regulation. Moreover, the ErbB-3 inactivation inhibits Akt phosphorylation, induces apoptosis and inhibits in vitro invasion favouring Tamoxifen responsiveness. The analysis of human tumors revealed a significant relationship between α6β4 and ErbB-3 in P-Akt-positive and ERβ1-negative breast cancers derived from patients with lower disease free survival. Conclusions We provided evidence that a strong relationship occurs between α6β4 and ErbB-3 positivity in ERβ1-negative breast cancers. We also found that the association between ErbB-3 and P-Akt positivity mainly occurs in ERβ1-negative breast cancer derived from patients with lower DFS indicating that both receptors are clinically relevant in predicting the response to Tamoxifen."

Methodology and Principal Findings This prospective randomized clinical trial at a tertiary referral hospital in southern India was undertaken to determine whether amylase resistant starch, substituting for glucose in hypo-osmolar oral rehydration solution, would reduce diarrhea duration and weight in adults with acute severe dehydrating diarrhea. 50 adult males with severe watery diarrhea of less than three days' duration and moderate to severe dehydration were randomized to receive hypo-osmolar ORS (HO-ORS) or HO-ORS in which amylase resistant high amylose maize starch 50g/L substituted for glucose (HAMS-ORS). All remaining therapy followed standard protocol. Duration of diarrhea (ORS commencement to first formed stool) in hours was significantly shorter with HAMS-ORS (median 19, IQR 10-28) compared to HO-ORS (median 42, IQR 24-50) (Bonferroni adjusted P, Padj<0.001). Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) showed faster recovery from diarrhea in the HAMS-ORS group (P<0.001, log rank test). Total diarrhea fecal weight in grams (median, IQR) was not significantly lower in the HAMS-ORS group (2190, 1160-5635) compared to HO-ORS (5210, 2095-12190) (Padj = 0.08). However, stool weight at 13-24 hours (280, 0-965 vs. 1360, 405-2985) and 25–48 hours (0, 0-360 vs. 1080, 55-3485) were significantly lower in HAMS-ORS compared to HO-ORS group (Padj = 0.048 and P = 0.012, respectively). ORS intake after first 24 hours was lower in the HAMS-ORS group. Subgroup analysis of patients with culture isolates of Vibrio cholerae indicated similar significant differences between the treatment groups. Conclusions Compared to HO-ORS, HAMS-ORS reduced diarrhea duration by 55% and significantly reduced fecal weight after the first 12 hours of ORS therapy in adults with cholera-like diarrhea.

https://openalex.org/W2076260974,"Yeast Phs1 is the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase that catalyzes the third reaction of the four-step cycle in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). In yeast, the hydrophobic backbone of sphingolipids, ceramide, consists of a long-chain base and an amide-linked C26 VLCFA. Therefore, defects in VLCFA synthesis would be expected to greatly affect sphingolipid synthesis. In fact, in this study we found that reduced Phs1 levels result in significant impairment of the conversion of ceramide to inositol phosphorylceramide. Phs1 proteins are conserved among eukaryotes, constituting a novel protein family. Phs1 family members exhibit no sequence similarity to other dehydratase families, so their active site sequence and catalytic mechanism have been completely unknown. Here, by mutating 22 residues conserved among Phs1 family members, we identified six amino acid residues important in Phs1 function, two of which (Tyr-149 and Glu-156) are indispensable. We also examined the membrane topology of Phs1 using an N-glycosylation reporter assay. Our results suggest that Phs1 is a membrane-spanning protein that traverses the membrane six times and has an N terminus and C terminus facing the cytosol. The important amino acids are concentrated in or near two of the six proposed transmembrane regions. Thus, we also propose a catalytic mechanism for Phs1 that is not unlike mechanisms used by other hydratases active in lipid synthesis.

Sphingolipids are abundant lipid components of eukaryotic plasma membranes that have roles in a wide range of biological processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, cell cycle control, adhesion, and intracellular trafficking (1Pettus B.J.

In mammals, FA chain length ranges from C14 to C26, except in certain tissues such as skin, testis, and sperm, which have even longer FAs (4Poulos A. Johnson D.W. Beckman K. White I.G. Easton C.

In contrast, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the chain length of the FA moiety in CER is predominantly C26. FAs with chain length of 20 or longer are known as very long chain (VLCFAs), and they themselves function in numerous cellular processes, including glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol anchor biogenesis (8Fujita, M., and Jigami, Y. (2008) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in pressGoogle Scholar), maintenance of a functional nuclear envelope (9Schneiter R. Hitomi M. Ivessa A.S. Fasch E.V. Kohlwein S.D. Tartakoff A.M. Mol. Cell.

Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In fact, yeast mutants deficient in VLCFA production are inviable (13Revardel E. Bonneau M. Durrens P. Aigle M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), indicating that VLCFAs perform essential functions that cannot be substituted for by more common long-chain FAs (LCFAs) such as C16 and C18. Furthermore, any impairment of VLCFA production also affects the function of those sphingolipids that carry these long chains.In yeast or mammals, the synthesis of LCFAs is carried out by a multienzyme known as soluble fatty-acid synthase (FAS) (15Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). FA elongation occurs by cycling through a four-step process (condensation, reduction, dehydration, and reduction), during which the FA chain is bound covalently to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain of FAS. Mammalian and yeast FAS (type I FAS) incorporate all catalytic activities of the cyclic reaction as discrete domains on one and two polypeptide chain(s), respectively (15Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 16Schweizer E. Hofmann J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In bacteria, plants, and mitochondria, however, FAS (type II) includes a dissociated system wherein each component is encoded by a separate gene (17White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Mammalian and yeast LCFAs can be further converted to VLCFAs by an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-bound elongase complex (18Denic V. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2007; 130: 663-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This reaction is also carried out by cycling through a four-step process similar to that performed by FAS (Fig. 1); however malonyl-CoA and acyl-CoA are not covalently attached to the complex but exist as separate compounds. The yeast elongase complex is composed of at least four different polypeptide enzymes. The 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase Phs1, which is responsible for the third step, catalyzes the dehydration of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA (18Denic V. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2007; 130: 663-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Phs1 was first reported as a factor involved in sphingolipid metabolism (19Schuldiner M. Collins S.R. Thompson N.J. Denic V. Bhamidipati A. Punna T. Ihmels J. Andrews B. Boone C. Greenblatt J.F. Weissman J.S. Krogan N.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 507-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). This study found that decreases in Phs1 levels were accompanied by increases in the LCBs dihydrosphingosine (DHS) and phytosphingosine (PHS) and in their phosphorylated forms, the LCB phosphates (19Schuldiner M. Collins S.R. Thompson N.J. Denic V. Bhamidipati A. Punna T. Ihmels J. Andrews B. Boone C. Greenblatt J.F. Weissman J.S. Krogan N.J.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35440-35449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Phs1 is highly conserved among eukaryotes, constituting a novel protein family. Mammals have two homologs, PTPLA and PTPLB. Expression of PTPLA mRNA is restricted to heart and muscle (21Li D. Gonzalez O. Bachinski L.L. Roberts R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas PTPLB mRNA is ubiquitously expressed (22Wang B. Pelletier J. Massaad M.J. Herscovics A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PTPLA has been linked to certain muscle diseases, and disruption of the dog gene PTPLA results in centronuclear myopathy (23Pelé M. Tiret L. Kessler J.L. Blot S. Panthier J.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1417-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations in the human PTPLA gene were found in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (21Li D. Gonzalez O. Bachinski L.L. Roberts R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although the relationship between the mutation and the disease is not clear.Despite having a similar activity, Phs1 shares no sequence similarity to either the 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase of FAS II or to the 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase domain of FAS I. The dehydratase active sites of the FASs share a conserved His residue (17White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar); however, no conserved His residue exists in Phs1 family members. Furthermore, Phs1 enzymes are predicted to be multispanning membrane proteins, whereas the FASs are soluble. Therefore, both the overall structures and the catalytic mechanisms of Phs1 family members and 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (or domain) of FASs may differ greatly. Determining the essential amino acid residues and membrane topology of Phs1 is an important step in understanding its catalytic mechanism. In this study, we changed each of 22 amino acid residues conserved in the Phs1 family to Ala. We identified six important residues, two of which were essential for Phs1 function. In addition, we examined the membrane topology of Phs1 using an N-glycosylation reporter assay, and we now propose that Phs1 is a membrane-spanning protein that traverses the membrane six times, with its N terminus and C terminus facing the cytosol.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Media—Several S. cerevisiae strains were used.

The KanMX4 gene in the TH_3237 cell line was replaced with the LEU2 gene to produce SAY33 cells. The DEY102 line (R1158, Δpep4::MET15) was constructed by replacing the entire open reading frame of the PEP4 gene with the MET15 marker. The DEY113 (BY4741, Δpep4::MET15 Δprb1::KanMX4) cell line was constructed by replacing the entire open reading frames of the PEP4 and PRB1 genes with the MET15 and KanMX4 markers, respectively. All cells were grown in either YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, and 2% d-glucose) or synthetic complete (SC) medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base and 2% d-glucose) containing nutritional supplements.Quantitative Analysis of LCB Levels—Cells from each line tested (∼3.8 × 107 cells) were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 100 μl of water. After 60 pmol of sphingosine (chain length C18) was added as an internal control, lipids were extracted from cells by successively adding and mixing 375 μl of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:200:1, v/v), 125 μl of chloroform, and 125 μl of 1% KCl. Phases were separated by centrifugation, and the organic phase was recovered, dried, and suspended in 120 μl of ethanol by sonication and by heating for 25 min at 67 °C. The obtained lipid solution was then treated with 15 μl of OPA reagent (1 mg/ml o-phthalaldehyde and 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol in 3% boric acid (pH 10.5)) for 1 h at room temperature. After a centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant (10 μl) was resolved by HPLC (Agilent 1100 series; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) on a pre-packed C18 reverse phase column (COSMOSIL 5C18-AR-II; Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) using an isocratic eluent composition of methanol, 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1 m tetrabutylammonium dihydrogen phosphate (83:16:1, v/v), at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min at 40 °C. Lipids modified with o-phthalaldehyde were monitored at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 455 nm.In Vivo Labeling Experiments—Prior to [14C]Ser labeling, yeast cells were grown to ∼1.25 × 107 cells/ml in SC medium lacking Ser and Thr, and then 1 ml of cells were labeled with 1 μCi of [14C]Ser (157 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C. After labeling, cells were chilled on ice, collected by centrifugation, and suspended in ethanol, water, diethyl ether, pyridine, 15 n ammonia (15:15:5:1:0.018, v/v). After a 15-min incubation at 60 °C, cell debris and extracted lipids were separated by a 2-min centrifugation at 2,000 × g and at room temperature. Radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation system (LSC-3600; Aloka, Tokyo, Japan), and samples containing lipids of equal radioactivity were used for further study. Alkaline treatment was performed on each lipid solution by incubating it with a 1:5 volume of 0.5 n NaOH in methanol for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by neutralizing with acetic acid. Lipids were dried and then suspended in 100 μl of water-saturated 1-butanol. To desalt the samples 50 μl of water was added, and the solution was mixed vigorously and then separated into phases by centrifugation. Lipids in the water phase were re-extracted by adding 100 μl of water-saturated 1-butanol. Organic phases were mixed, dried, and suspended in 20 μl of chloroform/methanol/water (5:4:1, v/v). Lipids were separated by TLC on Silica Gel 60 high performance TLC plates (Merck) with chloroform, methanol, 4.2 n ammonia (9:7:2, v/v) or chloroform, methanol, 15 n ammonia (60:12:1, v/v) as the solvent system.[3H]Inositol labeling was performed on yeast cells grown in YPD medium to ∼1.25 × 107 cells/ml, and then 1 ml of cells was labeled with 20 μCi of [1,2-3H]inositol (60 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h at 30 °C. Lipid extraction and TLC separation were done as described above.Plasmids—The plasmid pUG23, a yeast expression vector encoding a fusion protein with a C-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein under the control of the MET15 promoter, was a gift from Dr. J. H. Hegemann (Heinrich-Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany). The enhanced green fluorescent protein region of pUG23 was removed altogether or replaced with a 3xFLAG tag, creating the pWK151 or pAK881 plasmid, respectively.The plasmid pSH14 (PHS1-3xFLAG) was constructed in our laboratory.

A BamHI site was then created in the PHS1-3xFLAG gene of pSH14 at each of the desired positions using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and the primers listed in Table 1. Finally, the BamHI-treated fragment of the region encompassing the SUC2 glycosylation cassette was inserted into the BamHI site of the respective constructs.The pAK400 plasmid, a derivative of pRS426 (27Christianson T.W.

The resulting fragment was digested with SmaI and SpeI and then cloned into the SmaI-SpeI site of pAK400, producing pSH86.Sucrose Gradient Fractionation—Sucrose gradient fractionation was performed as described previously (28Uemura S.

Briefly, yeast spheroplasts in lysis buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 12.5% sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 1× Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free; Roche Diagnostics), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) were lysed using an electric Potter homogenizer for 10 strokes. Unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting pellet (total membrane fraction) was suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer A and loaded onto a step sucrose gradient (0.75 ml of 26% sucrose (w/v), 0.75 ml of 34% sucrose, 1.5 ml of 42% sucrose, 3 ml of 46% sucrose, 2 ml of 50% sucrose, 1.5 ml of 54% sucrose, and 1 ml of 60% sucrose) in buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 1× Complete™, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After samples were centrifuged at 240,000 × g in an SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) for 4 h at 4 °C, 11 fractions were collected from top to bottom. Each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE and was subjected to immunoblotting or to an in vitro inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC) synthase assay.Immunoblotting Assays—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (29Kihara A. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30048-30054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using ECL™ Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). Anti-Sec61 antibodies (1:3,000 dilution; a gift from Dr. Randy Schekman, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Berkeley), anti-Anp1 antibodies (1:4000 dilution; a gift from Dr. Sean Munro, Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK), anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (1 μg/ml; Stratagene), anti-Pgk1 antibodies (0.25 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and anti-HA HA7 antibodies (1 μg/ml; Sigma) were used as primary antibodies. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (both from GE Healthcare and diluted 1:7500) were used as secondary antibodies.In Vitro IPC Synthase Assays—In vitro IPC synthase assays were performed essentially as described elsewhere (30Levine T.P. Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2267-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Each sucrose gradient fraction (50 μl) was mixed with 50 μl of reaction mix (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 2 mm CHAPS, 10 μm BODIPY FL C5-CER (Invitrogen), 10 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 150 μm phosphatidylinositol (PI) liposome, 250 mm sucrose, 1× Complete™ protease inhibitor, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. Lipids were extracted by successively adding and mixing 333 μl of chloroform, methanol, 1 n HCl (4:10:1, v/v), 42 μl of 1 n HCl, and 83 μl of chloroform. Phases were separated by centrifugation, and the organic phase was recovered, dried, and suspended in 20 μl of chloroform. Lipids were separated by TLC on Silica Gel 60 high performance TLC plates with chloroform, methanol, 30 mm KCl (11:9:2, v/v) as the solvent system. The amount of BODIPY-IPC was quantified using a fluoroimaging analyzer FLA-2000 (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan).Deglycosylation of Proteins—Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Deglycosylation of Phs1 carrying the inserted N-glycosylation cassette was performed using Endo H according to the manufacturer's instruction.In Vitro 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydratase Assay—Yeast spheroplasts (∼3 × 108 cells) in lysis buffer B (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 6.8), 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm CaCl2, 200 mm sorbitol, 1× Complete™, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) were lysed using an electric Potter homogenizer for 10 strokes. Unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet (low speed pellet) was suspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer B and then mixed with 850 μl of solubilization buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 6.8), 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1% digitonin, 200 mm sorbitol, 1× Complete™, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, samples were subjected to ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma). Beads were washed twice with 1 ml of wash buffer (150 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 6.8), 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.5% digitonin, 200 mm sorbitol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and bound proteins were eluted three times with 75 μl of elution buffer (wash buffer plus 100 μg/ml 3xFLAG peptide (Sigma)). Elution fractions were pooled and stored at –80 °C.In vitro 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase assays were performed by mixing purified Phs1–3xFLAG protein in reaction buffer (total volume of 50 μl; 150 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 6.8), 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.5% digitonin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 0.05 μCi of 3-[14C]hydroxypalmitoyl-CoA (55 mCi/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) and then incubating the mixture at 37 °C for various times. The reactions were terminated by adding 25 μl of 75% KOH (w/v) and 50 μl of ethanol, then saponified at 70 °C for 1 h, and acidified by adding 100 μl of 5 n HCl with 50 μl of ethanol. Lipids were extracted twice, each with 700 μl of hexane, and then the extracts were pooled, dried, and suspended in 35 μl of chloroform. Lipids were separated by TLC on LK50F Silica Gel 150A TLC plates (Whatman, Kent, UK) with hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (30:70:1, v/v) as the solvent system.Immunoprecipitation—Yeast spheroplasts in lysis buffer C (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm sorbitol, 1× Complete™, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) were lysed by sonication then treated with 1% digitonin. Proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2-agarose, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblotting as described above.RESULTSDecreases in Phs1 Levels Cause a Significant Accumulation of PHS with C20 Chain Length—Previous studies found that decreases in Phs1 cause an accumulation of LCBs (18Denic V. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2007; 130: 663-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 19Schuldiner M. Collins S.R. Thompson N.J. Denic V. Bhamidipati A. Punna T. Ihmels J.

Because the PHS1 gene cannot be deleted because of its essential function, we used the yeast strain TH_3237 and its derivative (referred to here as Tet-PHS1), which carries the PHS1 gene under the control of the TetO7 promoter. The Tet-PHS1 cells were unable to form colonies on YPD plates containing doxycycline (DOX), which shuts off gene expression under the TetO7 promoter (data not shown). When DOX was added to the culture medium, the growth of the Tet-PHS1 cells began to slow at 4 h (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, in the absence of DOX the growth rate of the Tet-PHS1 cells was only slightly slower than that of the wild type cells (Fig. 2A). Thus, to avoid nonspecific effects caused by growth inhibition, we studied DOX-treated Tet-PHS1 cells at earlier time points (4–6 h after adding DOX).FIGURE 2Decreased Phs1 levels cause an accumulation of LCBs. A, SAY31 (wild type; WT) and SAY32 (Tet-PHS1; Tet) cells were grown at 30 °C in YPD medium in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml DOX. At the indicated time points following the addition of DOX to the culture media, aliquots of cell suspensions were measured for cell density (A600) as a determination of growth. Values represent the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. B and C, R1158 (wild type) and SAY33 (Tet-PHS1) cells were grown"
https://openalex.org/W2135533466,"Understanding growth factor function during wound repair is necessary for the development of therapeutic interventions to improve healing outcomes. In the current study, we compare the effects of serum and purified growth factors on human fibroblast function in three different collagen matrix models: cell migration in nested matrices, floating matrix contraction, and stressed-released matrix contraction. The results of these studies indicate that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is unique in its capacity to promote cell migration. Serum, lysophosphatidic acid, sphingosine-1-phophate (S1P), and endothelin-1 promote stressed-released matrix contraction but not cell migration. In addition, we found that S1P inhibits fibroblast migration and treatment of serum to remove lipid growth factors or treatment of cells to interfere with S1P(2) receptor function increases serum promigratory activity. Our findings suggest that different sets of growth factors generate promigratory and procontractile tissue environments for fibroblasts and that the balance between PDGF and S1P is a key determinant of fibroblast promigratory activity."
https://openalex.org/W2010993438,"Unknown and foreign viruses can be detected using degenerate primers targeted at conserved sites in the known viral gene sequences. Conserved sites are found by comparing sequences and so the usefulness of a set of primers depends crucially on how well the known sequences represent the target group including unknown sequences.We developed a method for assessing the apparent stability of consensus sequences at sites over time using deposition dates from Genbank. We tested the method using 17 conserved sites in potyvirus genomes. The accumulation of knowledge of sequence variants over 20 years caused 'consensus decay' of the sites. Rates of decay were rapid at all sites but varied widely and as a result, the ranking of the most conserved sites changed. The discovery and reporting of sequences from previously unknown and distinct species, rather than from strains of known species, dominated the decay, indicating it was largely a sampling effect related to the progressive discovery of species, and recent virus mutation was probably only a minor contributing factor.We showed that in the past, the sampling bias has misled the choice of the most conserved target sites for genus specific degenerate primers. The history of sequence discoveries indicates primer designs should be updated regularly and provides an additional dimension for improving the design of degenerate primers."

The MPTP macaque model was used to study the proteome in dopamine-depleted striatum with and without subsequent acute and chronic L-dopa treatment using two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry. The present data suggest that the dopamine-depleted striatum is so sensitive to de novo L-dopa treatment that the first ever administration alone would be able (i) to induce rapid post-translational modification-based proteomic changes that are specific to this first exposure and (ii), possibly, lead to irreversible protein level changes that would be not further modified by chronic L-dopa treatment. The apparent equivalence between first and chronic L-dopa administration suggests that priming would be the direct consequence of dopamine loss, the first L-dopa administrations only exacerbating the sensitization process but not inducing it."
https://openalex.org/W1989247878,"TOR kinases integrate environmental and nutritional signals to regulate cell growth in eukaryotic organisms. Here, we describe results from a study combining quantitative proteomics and comparative expression analysis in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, to gain insights into TOR function and regulation. We profiled protein abundance changes under conditions of TOR inhibition by rapamycin treatment, and compared this data to existing expression information for corresponding gene products measured under a variety of conditions in yeast. Among proteins showing abundance changes upon rapamycin treatment, almost 90% of them demonstrated homodirectional (i.e., in similar direction) transcriptomic changes under conditions of heat/oxidative stress. Because the known downstream responses regulated by Tor1/2 did not fully explain the extent of overlap between these two conditions, we tested for novel connections between the major regulators of heat/oxidative stress response and the TOR pathway. Specifically, we hypothesized that activation of regulator(s) of heat/oxidative stress responses phenocopied TOR inhibition and sought to identify these putative TOR inhibitor(s). Among the stress regulators tested, we found that cells (hsf1-R206S, F256S and ssa1-3 ssa2-2) constitutively activated for heat shock transcription factor 1, Hsf1, inhibited rapamycin resistance. Further analysis of the hsf1-R206S, F256S allele revealed that these cells also displayed multiple phenotypes consistent with reduced TOR signaling. Among the multiple Hsf1 targets elevated in hsf1-R206S, F256S cells, deletion of PIR3 and YRO2 suppressed the TOR-regulated phenotypes. In contrast to our observations in cells activated for Hsf1, constitutive activation of other regulators of heat/oxidative stress responses, such as Msn2/4 and Hyr1, did not inhibit TOR signaling. Thus, we propose that activated Hsf1 inhibits rapamycin resistance and TOR signaling via elevated expression of specific target genes in S. cerevisiae. Additionally, these results highlight the value of comparative expression analyses between large-scale proteomic and transcriptomic datasets to reveal new regulatory connections."
https://openalex.org/W2046469884,"The ability to exogenously impose targeted epigenetic changes in the genome represents an attractive route for the simulation of genomic de novo epigenetic events characteristic of some diseases and for the study of their downstream effects and also provides a potential therapeutic approach for the heritable repression of selected genes. Here we demonstrate for the first time the ability of zinc finger peptides to deliver DNA cytosine methylation in vivo to a genomic integrated target promoter when expressed as fusions with a mutant prokaryotic DNA cytosine methyltransferase enzyme, thus mimicking cellular genomic de novo methylation events and allowing a direct analysis of the mechanics of de novo DNA methylation-mediated gene silencing at a genomic locus. We show that targeted methylation leads to gene silencing via the initiation of a repressive chromatin signature at the targeted genomic locus. This repression is maintained after the loss of targeted methyltransferase enzyme from the cell, confirming epigenetic maintenance purely through the action of cellular enzymes. The inherited DNA methylation pattern is restricted only to targeted sites, suggesting that the establishment of repressive chromatin structure does not drive further de novo DNA methylation in this system. As well as demonstrating the potential of these enzymes as tools for the exogenous, heritable control of cellular gene expression, this work also provides the most definitive confirmation to date for a transcriptionally repressive role for de novo DNA methylation in the cell and lends some weight to the hypothesis that the aberrant methylation associated with certain diseases may well be a cause rather than a consequence of transcriptional gene repression.

Hypermethylation at CpG sequences is commonly observed in the promoters of a number of genes in cancer and is often associated with transcriptional down-regulation (reviewed in Ref. 1Baylin S.B. Nat. Clin. Pract. Oncol. 2005; 2: S4-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar); however, whether such patterns of DNA methylation are the end result, or the initiating cause, of gene shutdown is a longstanding question (2Baylin S. Bestor T.H. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 299-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The observed increases in levels of de novo methylation over time associated with some diseases, such as chronic myeloid leukemia and the progression from myelodysplastic syndrome to acute myeloid leukemia (3Zion M. Ben-Yehuda D. Avraham A. Cohen O. Wetzler M. Melloul D. Ben-Neriah Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10722-10726Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 4Quesnel B. Guillerm G.

However, the ability to study the characteristics and consequences of such de novo methylation has been limited by the inability to simulate this event in vivo. The only direct route currently available for the authentic delivery of de novo DNA methylation is the use of gene-targeted DNA cytosine methyltransferase (Mtase) 2The abbreviations used are:MtasemethyltransferaseFHF38H mutantCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay. enzymes. These enzymes comprise fusions of gene-specific DNA-binding proteins, e.g. rationally designed zinc finger proteins, with DNA cytosine methyltransferases. The ability to design zinc finger proteins to recognize virtually any DNA sequence using well established zinc finger/DNA recognition codes or to select zinc fingers specific for a particular DNA sequence via phage display strategies has enabled the evolution of a number of novel proteins with cellular function. These include gene-specific transcriptional activators and repressors as well as targeted restriction enzymes capable of gene modification in vivo (5Jamieson A.C. Miller J.C. Pabo C.O. Nat. Rev.

Following the initial demonstration of in vitro functionality of targeted cytosine methyltransferase enzymes (7Xu G.L. Bestor T.H. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), they have since been shown to be capable of delivering targeted methylation in bacteria, yeast, and the mammalian mitochondrial compartment (8McNamara A.R.

Minczuk M. Rohde C. Zhang Y. Ragozin S. Jeltsch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One potential problem with these enzymes has been the level of associated nontargeted methylation, which is sometimes unacceptably high due to the avidity of the wild-type Mtase components used and is often overlooked. Recently we showed that, employing four zinc finger arrays capable of binding to chromatin target sites (12McNamara A.R. Ford K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 228: 4865-4872Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13Smith A.E. Farzaneh F. Ford K.G. Biol. Chem. 2005; 2386: 95-99Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) in combination with reduced affinity/activity prokaryotic DNA cytosine methyltransferase mutants, methylation could be targeted to predetermined sequences with virtually no nonspecific methylation occurring (14Smith A.E. Ford K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 740-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The HpaII methyltransferase F38H mutant used in these latter studies (henceforth referred to as FH) demonstrated a significantly overall reduced methyltransferase activity relative to the wild-type enzyme because of a mutation in the conserved FXGXG motif involved in Mtase cofactor binding and target base interaction, which allowed the zinc finger protein component to dominate in DNA-protein interactions. The use of non-mammalian Mtases as fusion components, additionally, was thought to be more likely to reduce any potential interactions arising with regulatory cellular factors, such as has been shown to occur with the endogenous DNMT3A and DNMT3B Mtases (15Hermann A. Gowher H. Jeltsch A. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2571-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 16Spada F. Li F. Papworth M. Minczuk M. Rohde C. Zhang Y. Ragozin S. Jeltsch A. Adv.

To examine the applicability of targeted methylation in modulating gene expression in the context of mammalian genomic DNA generally and as a prelude to targeting more functionally complex endogenous promoters, we have transiently expressed four zinc finger/HpaII (FH)-based Mtases in cells harboring an integrated reporter gene in which expression is driven by a minimal promoter flanked with a high density of HpaII sites (5′-CCGG-3′) immediately adjacent to zinc finger recognition sites. The short- and longer-term consequences of transient expression of targeted DNA methyltransferases on the appearance of de novo DNA methylation patterns, gene expression levels, modulation of chromatin marks, and epigenetic inheritance were subsequently examined. Tissue Culture and CAT Analysis—NIH3T3 cells were stably transfected with a CAT reporter gene target construct based on pBLCAT (39Luckow B. Schultz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 105: 5490Crossref Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) as described previously (14Smith A.E. Ford K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 740-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Clonal cell lines with demonstrated CAT activity were transiently transfected using the Nucleofector system (Amaxa GmbH) at an average of 80% efficiency, confirmed by green fluorescent protein/fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Internal control β-galactosidase activity was assessed 48 h post-transfection to confirm equivalent transfection efficiencies within each experiment. CAT assays involved monitoring the level of acetyl transfer groups into 14C-labeled chloramphenicol resolved via TLC (Polygram™ SIL-G) and subsequently exposing the chromatogram to an imaging plate (Fuji), performed as described previously (13Smith A.E. Farzaneh F. Ford K.G. Biol. Chem. 2005; 2386: 95-99Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Methylation Analysis—Isolated genomic DNA was subjected to bisulfite modification using the EpiTect bisulfite kit (Qiagen Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA corresponding to the target site and flanking regions was amplified using nested PCR with two different sets of primers for comparative purposes to conclusively demonstrate that PCR amplification was not biased toward methylated sequences. Primers were designed to bind 200–300 bp flanking the target site and thymidine kinase promoter regions, embedded in the pBLCAT vector. The modified vector sequence is available on request. Primers (5′-3′) used were as follows: Set 1, TargF1 (-ggtattagagtagattgtattgagtg), TargR1 (-ctatcccatatcaccaactcaccatcttc), TargF2 (-ggatgtgttgtaagg(c/t)gattaagttggg), and TargR2 (-caactaactaaaatacctcaaaatattc); and Set 2, TargF1 (-gagtaattgttgggaagg), TargR1 (-acaactaactaaaatacctcaaaatattct), TargF2 (-aagggggatgtgttgtaag), and TargR2 (-ttctccattttaacttccttaact). These primer sets gave equivalent results in terms of methylation trends for cloned products. Nested primer sets used for downstream CAT gene methylation analysis were CATF1 (-tttttaggagttaaggaagttaaaatggag), CATR1 (-ttccaccactactcccattcatcaattc), CATF2 (-aagaatatttgaggtattttagtt), and CATR2 (-tatcacaccacaaaaataaaattccttcac). Measurement of Targeted Mtase Levels—Time-dependent expression of targeted Mtases in NIH3T3 cells containing the integrated target site was monitored via both Western blot and reverse transcription-PCR analyses. Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (14Smith A.E. Ford K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 740-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). FLAG antibody (F1804) was from Sigma, and phosphorylated Rb antibody (Ser-807/811; 93085) was from Cell Signaling Technology. Western blot analysis of targeted enzyme (4aZf-FH) expression over time involved overexposure (30 min) to film (via ECL assay) to ensure maximum detection. Reverse transcription-PCR, used to more accurately determine the loss of expression of targeted Mtases from target cells over time, was performed as described previously (14Smith A.E. Ford K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 740-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). EMSA Analysis—EMSA analysis used whole cell extracts derived from COS-1 cells transformed with relevant targeted Mtase expression constructs. EMSA probes used were representative of the target site used in targeted methylation experiments in vivo: 4aZf-CpG, 5′-ccggccggcaaggcttctgcgtcttccggcgccggcgccggccggcgccggccgg-3′; and 4bZf-CpG, 5′-ccggccggcaagagcgccgcgtcttccggcgccggcgccggccggcgccggccgg-3′. Zinc finger recognition sites are in bold, and HpaII sites are underlined. Bacterial ex vivo and in vivo methylation assays were performed as described previously and essentially involved either incubation of purified recombinant targeted/nontargeted HpaII Mtase with plasmids harboring a targetable site but with a background of nontargeted sites, followed by HpaII restriction of plasmid DNA, or restriction of plasmids purified from bacteria that were cotransformed with expression and target site vectors, respectively. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed essentially as described previously (40Cuthbert G.L. Daujat S. Snowden A.W. Erdjument-Bromage H. Hagiwara T.

Antibodies against histone H3K4me3 (ab8580) and H3K9me2 (ab1220) were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Primers used for TaqMan analysis of immunoprecipitated chromatin fragments were F1 (5′-gcagcgacccgcttaaca-3′), R1 (5′-cctgaaaatctgccaagct-3′), and TAM (5′-caacagcgtgccgcagatc-3′). De Novo Methylation of a Genomic Target Site—We constructed a clonal cell line containing a single integrated CAT reporter gene driven by a minimal thymidine kinase promoter, modified to contain 4aZf recognition sites (5′-GACGCAGAAGCC-3′) flanked by a high density of target HpaII sites and a low density of HhaI (5′-GCGC-3′) and CG sites. This distribution of sequences allowed us to discriminate between purely targeted methylation by the targeted HpaII enzyme (4aZf-FH) and the action of endogenous Mtases, which could potentially methylate at these additional embedded HhaI and CpG sites and at flanking CpG sites. The 4aZf protein is a derivative of the well characterized anti-p190Bcr-Abl three-zinc finger protein (17Choo Y. Sánchez-García I. Klug A. Nature. 1994; 372: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) modified by a single zinc finger extension (12McNamara A.R. Ford K.G.

Zinc finger peptides were expressed as N-terminal fusions with the HpaII (FH) mutant Mtase and were linked by a flexible linker (Gly4Ser)3. For a schematic of the proposed Mtase action and a more detailed description of the target site, see Fig. 1, A and B. In vitro DNA binding and methylation analysis confirmed specific targeted methylation within a complex DNA population (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B) (14Smith A.E. Ford K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 740-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and that tethering of the Mtase component at the zinc finger recognition site allows site-specific binding and targeted methylation to occur up to 40–45 bp away from the zinc finger site (supplemental Fig. S1D). Cells were transiently transfected at a high efficiency with 4aZf-FH or control constructs including ΔZf-FH, 4aZf alone, and 4bZf-FH (for a vector schematic, see Fig. 1C). The 4bZf-FH enzyme served as a control for any background methylation mediated via nonspecific zinc finger/methyltransferase-DNA interactions because the target region lacks 4bZf recognition sites (5′-GACGCGGCGCTC-3′). Isoschizomer restriction analysis (comparing restriction patterns generated by methylation-sensitive versus -insensitive restriction enzymes with the same sequence specificity) of plasmids coding for the 4aZf-FH and 4bZf-FH enzymes revealed similar levels of enzyme activity in bacteria, although these high copy number plasmids were seen to possess a low level of nonspecific methylation (supplemental Fig. S1C). Low copy number plasmids expressing these enzymes remained largely unmethylated. This effect of high cellular protein concentrations “overriding” the intrinsic specificity of zinc finger proteins has been reported previously by ourselves and others (13Smith A.E. Farzaneh F. Ford K.G. Biol. Chem. 2005; 2386: 95-99Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 18Choo Y. Castellanos A. Garcia-Hernandez B. Sanchez G. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and demonstrates the need for moderate levels of such targeted Mtase enzymes in cellular systems. The ΔZf-FH (zinc finger deletion) construct represented an additional control for monitoring any untargeted methylation due solely to mutant methyltransferase activity at the target region. Transfection with wild-type HpaII or 4aZf-HpaII Mtase constructs ultimately proved toxic to the cell over the time scale of the experiments and was not studied further, confirming the requirement for mutational approaches in the development of these targeted Mtase enzymes. Western blot analysis confirmed equivalent expression levels for constructs used (Fig. 2A). EMSA analysis using whole cell extracts also confirmed that cellularly expressed 4aZf-FH protein bound significantly only to DNA containing 4aZf with multiple flanking HpaII recognition sites, but not to probe containing just multiple HpaII sites (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the 4bZf-FH protein bound only to probe containing the 12-bp 4bZf and multiple HpaII sites, albeit less strongly than 4aZf-FH to its target site. EMSA for the weakly binding 4bZf-FH protein at relatively higher protein levels is also shown to more clearly confirm specific binding to its target probe (Fig. 2B, inset). More detailed analysis of the binding and methylation of these proteins is given elsewhere, both describing the ability of the 4aZf-FH enzyme to target methylation specifically in the context of complex genomes in in vitro assays and demonstrating similar general enzymatic activities between the 4aZf-FH and 4bZf-FH enzymes (supplemental Fig. S1) (14Smith A.E. Ford K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 740-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine the extent of any targeted DNA methylation, genomic DNA was isolated 16 days post-transfection with various constructs, and methylation status was assessed initially by BsiEI restriction of post-bisulfite-modified DNA (COBRA assay) (19Xiong Z. Laird P.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2532-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), sites for which are preserved through methylation of consecutive HpaII sites within the target sequence (Fig. 3A). Significant target site DNA methylation was associated with 4aZf-FH-transfected cells only, indicated by the observed cleavage of the PCR product (Fig. 3B, arrow), but not for 4bZf-FH- and ΔZf-FH-transfected cells, confirming target-specific methylation by the 4aZf-FH enzyme. Importantly and as a prerequisite to the further studies described in this work, the target site itself was not subject to de novo methylation by the endogenous Mtases of the cell. However, this may be a consequence of selecting clonal cell lines with a demonstrable reporter gene activity and hence a reduced likelihood of being the subject of cellular de novo methylation because methylated genes are more likely to be inactive. Clonal bisulfite sequencing analysis of the DNA methylation status of the target and flanking regions from independent experiments at an earlier time point (12 days post-transfection) (Fig. 3C) revealed significant target region methylation only after exposure to 4aZf-FH (49% of HpaII sites methylated) compared with 4bZf-FH (6.2%) and 4aZf protein or empty vector (2.1%). The low level of non-HpaII methylation observed at the target site after 4aZf-FH expression (1.7%) was the same level seen for control experiments and represents the normal background action of endogenous Mtases. No significant methylation spread, i.e. to non-HpaII sites in flanking sequences, was detected. Methylation analysis of a region comprising three additional downstream zinc finger recognition sites, which were flanked solely by non-HpaII CpG sites and which served as an internal control for the potential effects of endogenous cellular proteins interacting with the HpaII Mtase component of the targeted enzyme, revealed no significant methylation in this region. We have shown previously that the 4aZf-FH enzyme produces virtually no background methylation, even when expressed in the presence of the reasonably complex bacterial genome (14Smith A.E. Ford K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 740-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To further confirm that the low nontargeted activity of this enzyme was maintained in mammalian cells, we examined the methylation status of a cluster of HpaII sites in the body of the CAT gene, around 470 bp downstream from the target region (Fig. 3C, right panel). This analysis revealed no significant differences between control and 4aZf-FH-based experiments, confirming a lack of nonspecific action by targeted enzymes. Other attempts to identify possible nonspecific global DNA methylation as a result of targeted enzyme expression, e.g. via arbitrary-primed PCR approaches (20Liang G. Gonzalgo M.L. Salem C. Jones P.A. Methods (San Diego). 2002; 27: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or random bisulfite sequencing, revealed no obvious changes in methylation (data not shown). However, we suggest that attempting to detect low level stochastic events against the background of relatively high endogenous methylation throughout the genome is impractical as well as ultimately uninformative. Our inability to detect any significant methylation at the target site, which has a high density of HpaII sites, following expression of the nontargeted HpaII Mtase enzyme ΔZf-FH (Fig. 3B), for example, tends to support our conclusion that off-target methylation by the targeted Mtase enzyme itself would be too low to be readily detectable. Cellular Maintenance of the Directed de Novo Methylation Pattern—Previous experiments describe a persistent methylation pattern over time, predominantly at HpaII sites within the target region. To eliminate the contribution of sustained targeted methylation as a route for maintaining this epigenetic pattern, for example through the persistence of an extraordinarily stable protein structure, we performed Western blot analysis of targeted cells transiently transfected with the 4aZf-FH expression vector and monitored protein concentration over time (Fig. 4A). It can be seen that there is a rapid fall-off in protein expression from day 2, and after 6 days no evidence of 4aZf-FH expression remains, even after the overexposure shown in the figure. This correlates with the expected loss of expression vector from the cell following transient transfection over time. A more sensitive reverse transcription-PCR analysis, which can detect levels of RNA transcripts that would not necessarily give rise to detectable protein levels in Western blot analyses, also confirmed that at 7 days post-transient transfection, 4aZf-FH expression is undetectable (Fig. 4B). These two points taken together imply that an initial de novo methylation pattern, laid down by the transient action of the targeted Mtase, is being maintained by the cell. Importantly, this also demonstrates that the cell does not differentiate exogenously from endogenously derived de novo methylation patterns and, in concert with the observation that methylation is predominantly restricted to HpaII sites at the target region, that the exogenous methylation pattern is not maintained via an “overwriting” mechanism where specific input methylation patterns would be lost. Targeted Promoter Methylation Induces Heritable Gene Repression—The effect of directed de novo methylation on gene expression was measured after 6, 12, and 24 days, together with target region methylation status over the same time period as assessed by combined bisulfite restriction analysis assay. Expression of the 4aZf-FH enzyme resulted in a nearly 70% drop in CAT activity compared with controls (Fig. 5A) and correlated with the observed high levels of methylation at the target site (Fig. 5B). Significantly, this repression could be partially alleviated by treatment of cells with the DNA-demethylating agent 5-azacytidine or the histone deacetylase inhibitor MS275 and further alleviated by cotreatment with these drugs to a level above that of normal gene expression (see supplemental Fig. S1). A weak alleviation of repression over time was observed for 4aZf-FH-transfected cells, which was mirrored by a similar slight fall in methylation levels observed at the target site (Fig. 5B). This effect may be due to a gradual loss of maintenance methylation or an outgrowth of untransfected cells over multiple passages. Expression of the 4bZf-FH enzyme resulted in an initial drop in CAT activity of about 20% at day 6 but returned to control levels by day 12. This observation of low level methylation by the 4bZf-FH protein was attributed to low density and transient nonspecific methylation, which may have been below the threshold for maintenance and perhaps working in concert with the effects of transient promoter occupancy by the enzyme. The suggestion that the 4bZf zinc finger component is not able to fully suppress nonspecific methylation by the Mtase component is in line with the relatively weak binding of the 4bZf-FH enzyme to its target site (Fig. 2B). Zinc finger protein binding alone (4aZf) did not result in gene repression. Expression of weakly active 4aZf-HhaI mutant enzyme also failed to result in any significant gene repression (Fig. 5A) or methylation at any of the HhaI sites present within the target region above background (data not shown), in line with previous results for this enzyme (14Smith A.E. Ford K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 740-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and confirms the lack of general zinc finger fusion protein binding-induced effects in the absence of a fully functional Mtase component. To address issues relating to the possible contributions of reporter gene integration sites to de novo methylation-mediated gene repression, we performed CAT assays on pooled clonal populations harboring the integrated reporter vector (∼25 clones) that had been transfected with targeted Mtase and control vectors. Targeted Mtase expression induced a similar drop in gene expression levels to that of individual clones that were examined, suggesting no locus-specific bias toward gene repression (Fig. 5A). Given that intuitively, sites of integration are more likely to occur in euchromatic, i.e. normally transcriptionally active, regions of the genome, the demonstration of targeted methylation-mediated gene silencing at multiple regions of this type would suggest that this route for exogenous control of gene repression is robust. De Novo Methylation Initiates the Acquisition of a Repressive Histone Mark—Given the strong correlation historically observed between the methylation status of DNA and heterochromatin formation, we examined the chromatin composition associated with the target site/promoter region as a result of transient 4aZf-FH expression using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the promoter region showed that 4aZf-FH-targeted methylation was associated with a nearly 8-fold enrichment of histone H3K9me2 methylation (Fig. 6A), a histone modification known to be associated with transcriptional repression. This clearly pointed toward the initiation of a repressive histone mark for this region of DNA in response to de novo methylation. Similarly, analysis of histone H3K4me3, a marker for transcriptionally active chromatin (21Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar), showed a relative 2.5-fold reduction in response to 4aZf-FH expression compared with controls. There was no observable change in histone H3K9me2 or H3K4me3 in c-fos and afm gene promoters, which were examined as additional controls for the potential effects of any nontargeted background methylation on chromatin composition throughout the genome (Fig. 6B). It is widely accepted, mostly through the correlative observation that methylated genes in vivo ar"

We develop a framework that allows such modeling techniques to be applied to stem cells more generally. The fundamental modeling structure is the stochastic kinetics of stem cells in their niche and of transit amplifying and fully differentiated cells elsewhere in the organism, with positive and negative feedback. This formulation allows graded signals to be turned into all or nothing responses, and shows the importance of looking beyond the niche for understanding how stem cells behave. Using the deterministic version of this framework, we show how competition between different stem cell lines can be analyzed, and under what circumstances stem cells in a niche will be replaced by other stem cells with different phenotypic characteristics. Using the stochastic version of our framework and state dependent life history theory, we show that the optimal behavior of a focal stem cell will involve long periods of quiescence and that a population of identical stem cells will show great variability in the times at which activity occurs; we compare our results with classic ones on quiescence and variability in the hematopoietic system."

However, genetically susceptible ItyS mice (Nramp1(G169D) allele) die from systemic infection before they develop diarrhea, so a new model is needed to study the pathogenesis of diarrhea. We pretreated ItyR mice (Nramp1(G169)) with oral kanamycin prior to infecting them with virulent S. Typhimurium strain 14028s in order to study Salmonella-induced diarrhea. We used both a visual scoring system and the measurement of fecal water content to measure diarrhea. BALB/c.D2(Nramp1) congenic started losing weight 5 days post-infection and they began to die from colitis 10-14 days after infection. A SPI-1 (invA) mutant caused cecal, but not colonic inflammation and did not cause diarrhea. A phoP- mutant did not cause manifestations of diarrhea in either normal or NADPH-deficient (gp91(phox)) mice. However, strain 14028s caused severe colitis and diarrhea in gp91(phox)-deficient mice on an ItyR background. pmr A and F mutants, which are less virulent in orally infected BALB/c mice, were fully virulent in this model of colitis.S. enterica must be able to invade the colonic epithelium and to persist in the colon in order to cause colitis with manifestations of diarrhea. The NADPH oxidase is not required for diarrhea in Salmonella colitis. Furthermore, a Salmonella phoP mutant can be cleared from the colon by non-oxidative host defenses."
https://openalex.org/W2103132311,"Background In Malawi, there has been a return of Plasmodium falciparum sensitivity to chloroquine (CQ) since sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) replaced CQ as first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. When used for prophylaxis, Amodiaquine (AQ) was associated with agranulocytosis but is considered safe for treatment and is increasingly being used in Africa. Here we compare the efficacy, safety and selection of resistance using SP or CQ+SP or artesunate (ART)+SP or AQ+SP for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Methodology and Findings 455 children aged 1–5 years were recruited into a double-blinded randomised trial comparing SP to the three combination therapies. Using intention to treat analysis with missing outcomes treated as successes, and without adjustment to distinguish recrudescence from new infections, the day 28 adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) rate for SP was 25%, inferior to each of the three combination therapies (p<0.001). AQ+SP had an ACPR rate of 97%, higher than CQ+SP (81%) and ART+SP (70%), p<0.001. Nineteen children developed a neutropenia of ≤0.5×103 cells/µl by day 14, more commonly after AQ+SP (p = 0.03). The mutation pfcrt 76T, associated with CQ resistance, was detected in none of the pre-treatment or post-treatment parasites. The prevalence of the pfmdr1 86Y mutation was higher after treatment with AQ+SP than after SP, p = 0.002. Conclusions The combination AQ+SP was highly efficacious, despite the low efficacy of SP alone; however, we found evidence that AQ may exert selective pressure for resistance associated mutations many weeks after treatment. This study confirms the return of CQ sensitivity in Malawi and importantly, shows no evidence of the re-emergence of pfcrt 76T after treatment with CQ or AQ. Given the safety record of AQ when used as a prophylaxis, our observations of marked falls in neutrophil counts in the AQ+SP group requires further scrutiny.

https://openalex.org/W1576604661,"Transcripts of centromeric satellite DNAs are known to play a role in heterochromatin formation as well as in establishment of the kinetochore. However, little is known about basic mechanisms of satellite DNA expression within constitutive heterochromatin and its regulation. Here we present comprehensive analysis of transcription of abundant centromeric satellite DNA, PRAT from beetle Palorus ratzeburgii (Coleoptera). This satellite is characterized by preservation and extreme sequence conservation among evolutionarily distant insect species. PRAT is expressed in all three developmental stages: larvae, pupae and adults at similar level. Transcripts are abundant comprising 0.033% of total RNA and are heterogeneous in size ranging from 0.5 kb up to more than 5 kb. Transcription proceeds from both strands but with 10 fold different expression intensity and transcripts are not processed into siRNAs. Most of the transcripts (80%) are not polyadenylated and remain in the nucleus while a small portion is exported to the cytoplasm. Multiple, irregularly distributed transcription initiation sites as well as termination sites have been mapped within the PRAT sequence using primer extension and RLM-RACE. The presence of cap structure as well as poly(A) tails in a portion of the transcripts indicate RNA polymerase II–dependent transcription and a putative polymerase II promoter site overlaps the most conserved part of the PRAT sequence. The treatment of larvae with alpha-amanitin decreases the level of PRAT transcripts at concentrations that selectively inhibit pol II activity. In conclusion, stable, RNA polymerase II dependant transcripts of abundant centromeric satellite DNA, not regulated by RNAi, have been identified and characterized. This study offers a basic understanding of expression of highly abundant heterochromatic DNA which in beetle species constitutes up to 50% of the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1975029653,"The cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) is a key component of the lysosomal enzyme targeting system that binds newly synthesized mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P)-containing acid hydrolases and transports them to endosomal compartments. The interaction between the MPRs and its ligands is pH-dependent; the homodimeric CD-MPR binds lysosomal enzymes optimally in the pH environment of the trans Golgi network (pH approximately 6.5) and releases its cargo in acidic endosomal compartments (<pH 5.5) and at the cell surface. In addition, CD-MPR binding affinities are modulated by divalent cations. Our previous crystallographic studies have shown that at pH 6.5, the CD-MPR bound to Man-6-P adopts a significantly different quaternary conformation than the CD-MPR in a ligand-unbound state, a feature unique among known lectin structures. To determine whether different pH conditions elicit conformational changes in the receptor that alters ligand binding affinities, we have obtained additional crystal structures representative of the various environments encountered by the receptor including: 1) the CD-MPR bound at pH 6.5 (i.e. trans Golgi network) to a high affinity ligand (the terminally phosphorylated trisaccharide P-Man(alpha1,2)Man(alpha1,2)Man-O-(CH(2))(8)COOMe), 2) the CD-MPR at pH 4.8 in an unbound state (i.e. endosome), and 3) the CD-MPR at pH 7.4 (i.e. cell surface). A detailed comparison of the available CD-MPR structures reveals the positional invariability of specific binding pocket residues and implicates intermonomer contact(s), as well as the protonation state of Man-6-P, as regulators of pH-dependent carbohydrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W2081558711,"Cell polarity is an essential feature of animal cells contributing to morphogenesis. During Xenopus gastrulation, it is known that chordamesoderm cells are polarized and intercalate each other allowing anterior-posterior elongation of the embryo proper by convergent extension (CE). Although it is well known that the cellular protrusions at both ends of polarized cells exert tractive force for intercalation and that PCP pathway is known to be essential for the cell polarity, little is known about what triggers the cell polarization and what the polarization causes to control intracellular events enabling the intercalation that leads to the CE. In our research, we used EB3 (end-binding 3), a member of +TIPs that bind to the plus end of microtubule (MT), to visualize the intracellular polarity of chordamesoderm cells during CE to investigate the trigger of the establishment of cell polarity. We found that EB3 movement is polarized in chordamesoderm cells and that the notochord-somite tissue boundary plays an essential role in generating the cell polarity. This polarity was generated before the change of cell morphology and the polarized movement of EB3 in chordamesoderm cells was also observed near the boundary between the chordamesoderm tissue and naïve ectoderm tissue or lateral mesoderm tissues induced by a low concentration of nodal mRNA. These suggest that definitive tissue separation established by the distinct levels of nodal signaling is essential for the chordamesodermal cells to acquire mediolateral cell polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2020742608,"From the evolutionary and ecological points of view, it is essential to distinguish between the genetic and environmental components of the variability of life-history traits and of their trade-offs. Among the factors affecting this variability, the resource uptake rate deserves particular attention, because it depends on both the environment and the genetic background of the individuals. In order to unravel the bases of the life-history strategies in yeast, we grew a collection of twelve strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from different industrial and geographical origins in three culture media differing for their glucose content. Using a population dynamics model to fit the change of population size over time, we estimated the intrinsic growth rate (r), the carrying capacity (K), the mean cell size and the glucose consumption rate per cell. The life-history traits, as well as the glucose consumption rate, displayed large genetic and plastic variability and genetic-by-environment interactions. Within each medium, growth rate and carrying capacity were not correlated, but a marked trade-off between these traits was observed over the media, with high K and low r in the glucose rich medium and low K and high r in the other media. The cell size was tightly negatively correlated to carrying capacity in all conditions. The resource consumption rate appeared to be a clear-cut determinant of both the carrying capacity and the cell size in all media, since it accounted for 37% to 84% of the variation of those traits. In a given medium, the strains that consume glucose at high rate have large cell size and low carrying capacity, while the strains that consume glucose at low rate have small cell size but high carrying capacity. These two contrasted behaviors may be metaphorically defined as ""ant"" and ""grasshopper"" strategies of resource utilization. Interestingly, a strain may be ""ant"" in one medium and ""grasshopper"" in another. These life-history strategies are discussed with regards to yeast physiology, and in an evolutionary perspective."
https://openalex.org/W2088153636,"Background Because of the importance of voltage-activated K+ channels during embryonic development and in cell proliferation, we present here the first description of these channels in E15 rat embryonic neural progenitor cells derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ). Activation, inactivation, and single-channel conductance properties of recorded progenitor cells were compared with those obtained by others when these Kv gene products were expressed in oocytes. Methodology/Principal Findings Neural progenitor cells derived from the subventricular zone of E15 embryonic rats were cultured under conditions that did not promote differentiation. Immunocytochemical and Western blot assays for nestin expression indicated that almost all of the cells available for recording expressed this intermediate filament protein, which is generally accepted as a marker for uncommitted embryonic neural progenitor cells. However, a very small numbers of the cells expressed GFAP, a marker for astrocytes, O4, a marker for immature oligodendrocytes, and βIII-tubulin, a marker for neurons. Using immunocytochemistry and Western blots, we detected consistently the expression of Kv2.1, and 4.3. In whole-cell mode, we recorded two outward currents, a delayed rectifier and an A-type current. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that Kv2.1, and 4.3 are expressed in E15 SVZ neural progenitor cells, and we propose that they may be associated with the delayed-rectifier and the A-type currents, respectively, that we recorded. These results demonstrate the early expression of delayed rectifier and A-type K+ currents and channels in embryonic neural progenitor cells prior to the differentiation of these cells."

However, neither expression of ALDH2 nor its functional role in GTN bioactivation has been reported for the main drug target in humans, namely capacitance vessels. We investigated whether ALDH2 is expressed in human veins and whether inhibition of the enzyme attenuates nitroglycerin effects in these vessels. We determined expression of ALDH2 and dehydrogenase activity in human veins by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence microscopy. In vitro contraction experiments were performed in the presence or absence of the ALDH inhibitors chloral hydrate, cyanamide, and ethoxycyclopropanol. Concentration response curves were determined for the alpha-agonist phenylephrine, nitroglycerin, and the direct NO donor diethylamine NONOate (DEA-NONOate). ALDH2 expression was largely confined to smooth muscle cells as determined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Contractile responses to phenylephrine were unaffected by all ALDH inhibitors tested. In clear contrast, the ALDH inhibitors significantly reduced the potency of nitroglycerin by approximately 1 order of magnitude (P < or = 0.01). Neither of the inhibitors affected the potency of the direct NO donor DEA-NONOate, which ruled out nonspecific effects on the NO signaling cascade. In human capacitance vessels, ALDH2 is a key enzyme in the biotransformation of the frequently used antianginal drug nitroglycerin."

We established a model of HCC in rats involving minor trauma plus severe hemorrhagic shock (HS). HCC in this model was accompanied by a 50% reduction in peak acceleration of aortic blood flow and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. HCC and apoptosis increased with increasing duration of hypotension. Apoptosis required resuscitation, which provided an opportunity to intervene therapeutically. Administration of IL-6 completely reversed HCC, prevented cardiac dysfunction and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, reduced mortality 5-fold and activated intracardiac signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3. Pre-treatment of rats with a selective inhibitor of Stat3, T40214, reduced the IL-6-mediated increase in cardiac Stat3 activity, blocked successful resuscitation by IL-6 and reversed IL-6-mediated protection from cardiac apoptosis. The hearts of mice deficient in the naturally occurring dominant negative isoform of Stat3, Stat3beta, were completely resistant to HS-induced apoptosis. Microarray analysis of hearts focusing on apoptosis related genes revealed that expression of 29% of apoptosis related genes was altered in HS vs. sham rats. IL-6 treatment normalized the expression of these genes, while T40214 pretreatment prevented IL-6-mediated normalization. Thus, cardiac dysfunction, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and induction of apoptosis pathway genes are important components of HCC; IL-6 administration prevented HCC by blocking cardiomyocyte apoptosis and induction of apoptosis pathway genes via Stat3 and warrants further study as a resuscitation adjuvant for prevention of HCC and death in trauma patients."

Previous studies established that glucocorticoid-induced alterations in intracellular calcium homeostasis promote apoptosis, but the mechanism by which glucocorticoids disrupt calcium homeostasis is unknown. Through gene expression array analysis, we found that dexamethasone induces a striking elevation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) levels in two murine lymphoma cell lines, WEHI7.2 and S49.A2. IP3R elevation was confirmed at both mRNA and protein levels. However, there was not a strong correlation between IP3R elevation and altered calcium homeostasis in terms of either kinetics or dose response. Moreover, IP3R knockdown, by either antisense or small interfering RNA, did not prevent either calcium disruption or apoptosis. Finally, DT40 lymphoma cells lacking all three IP3R isoforms were just as sensitive to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis as wild-type DT40 cells expressing all three IP3R isoforms.

Thompson E.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 94: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Pioneering studies decades ago used the WEHI7.2 and S49 murine T-cell lines to demonstrate the essential role of glucocorticoid receptors in mediating cell death induction by dexamethasone (8Sibley C.H. Tompkins G.M. Cell. 1974; 2: 213-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Numerous studies, including those employing the CEM human T-cell leukemia line and transgenic mouse models, have further refined our knowledge of the role of glucocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid-mediated gene regulation in this important form of apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 4Distelhorst C.W. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 6-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 9Thompson E.B. Harmon J.M. Adv. Exp. Med.

Using similar model systems, the technology of oligonucleotide microarray analysis has been applied to identify the spectrum of genes regulated by glucocorticoids in both normal and leukemic lymphocytes (11Obexer P.

Gene expression analysis has also been extended to glucocorticoid-treated primary leukemia cells isolated from patient samples (17Schmidt S. Rainer J. Rimi S. Ploner C. Jesacher S. Achmuller C.

Not surprisingly, these studies have identified a large number of glucocorticoid-regulated genes, including the gene encoding the pro-apoptotic protein Bim (15Wang Z. Malone M.H. He H. McColl K.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23861-23867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Bim knockdown inhibits glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, and hence, its up-regulation by dexamethasone plays a critical role in this cell death process (19Zhang L. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Abrams M.T. Robertson N.M. Yoon K. Wickstrom E. J. Biol.

IP3Rs are ligand-gated calcium channels located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (reviewed in Refs. 24Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 25Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A.

Various roles for IP3Rs in cell survival and apoptosis have been proposed (reviewed in Ref. 27Joseph S.K. Hajnoczky G. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 951-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Finding that IP3R expression is glucocorticoid-induced is intriguing because numerous reports indicate that glucocorticoid treatment alters calcium homeostasis in lymphocytes, contributing to cell death induction (reviewed in Refs. 4Distelhorst C.W. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 6-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar and 28Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2364) Google Scholar). One might speculate that IP3R elevation could contribute to alterations in calcium homeostasis in the absence of IP3-mediated stimulation through several mechanisms. If IP3Rs are not completely closed in the basal unstimulated state, net calcium leakage would be magnified by an elevation of IP3R levels. Also, other events associated with the cell death process may trigger IP3R-mediated calcium loss from the ER as follows: (i) elevation of reactive oxygen species, known to sensitize IP3Rs to endogenous levels of IP3 (29Bootman M.D. Taylor C.W. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25113-25119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) release from mitochondria of cytochrome c, which is reported to bind to IP3Rs and enhance their opening (30Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar); and (iii) activation of caspases, which cleave IP3Rs, producing a continuously open truncated channel (31Hirota J. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34433-34437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32Assefa Z. Bultynck G. Szlufcik K. Kasri N.N. Vermassen E. Goris J.

Therefore, in the work described here, the dexamethasone-mediated elevation of IP3Rs is confirmed at both the mRNA and protein levels, and the hypothesis that IP3R induction mediates calcium changes that promote apoptosis is tested by multiple approaches.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma.Cell Culture and Gene Expression Analysis—WEHI7.2 and S49.A2 cells were cultured and gene expression analysis was conducted using Affymetrix MG-U74A (version 2) GeneChips as described previously (15Wang Z. Malone M.H. He H. McColl K.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23861-23867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). DT40 wild-type and IP3R triple-knockdown cell lines, originally created by Sugawara et al. (33Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), were gifts from William Schilling (Case Western Reserve University) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 1% chicken serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 12.5 units/ml penicillin, and 12.5 μg/ml streptomycin.Northern Blotting—Northern blotting was performed by standard methods. Full-length cDNA probes for IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3 were obtained by performing restriction digests on pGEM-T Easy vectors (Promega) that contained full-length sequences generated by PCR from expression constructs for IP3R1 and IP3R3 (gifts from Dr. Suresh Joseph, Thomas Jefferson University) and IP3R2 (gift from Dr. Jean-François Dufour, University of Bern).Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (34Chen R. Valencia I. Zhong F. McColl K.S. Roderick H.L. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Mignery G.A. Velez P. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) with protein samples electrophoretically resolved through 4–20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad). The antibodies for IP3R1, IP3R3, and β-actin were purchased from Calbiochem, Pharmingen, and Sigma, respectively. Antibody for IP3R2 was a gift from Richard Wojcikiewicz (SUNY Upstate Medical University).Ca2+ Measurements—Ca2+ measurements by fluorometry were performed as described previously (34Chen R. Valencia I. Zhong F. McColl K.S. Roderick H.L. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Mignery G.A. Velez P. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded in extracellular buffer (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm glucose) with 1 μm Fura-2/AM for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in fresh extracellular buffer and incubated for 30 min at room temperature to allow dye de-esterification. Ca2+ measurements were then performed on a fluorometer (Photon Technologies, Inc.). 10 mm EGTA was added immediately before cytosolic Ca2+ was measured to chelate extracellular Ca2+ and eliminate its contribution to the determined Ca2+ concentration. Data were analyzed using Felix software version 1.42 (Photon Technologies, Inc.).Flow Cytometric Apoptosis Assays—One million cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold methanol for fixation. After incubation for at least 1 h at –20 °C, cells were centrifuged, washed once with PBS, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in staining solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Molecular Probes), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 μg/ml RNase A, and 0.1% sodium azide in PBS). Propidium iodide fluorescence was measured with a FACScan XL flow cytometer (Coulter). Single whole cells with a DNA content less than that of the G1 population were scored as apoptotic. Data analysis was conducted using WinList 3D version 5.0 (Verity Software House). Quantification of apoptosis in live cells, as performed in experiments using DT40 cells, was as follows. 24 h after vector electroporation, 1 million cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were then analyzed on a BD Biosciences LSR flow cytometer, exciting Hoechst 33342 with a UV laser and GFP with a 488-nm laser. Single whole cells with a DNA content less than that of the G1 population were scored as apoptotic.RNA Interference—The negative control siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA pool as well as IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3 siGENOME SMARTpools were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). After suspension in 1× siRNA buffer, SMARTpools were added at a concentration of 1 μm each to 0.2-cm cuvettes containing 10 million WEHI7.2 cells suspended in 200 μl of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen). Cuvettes were then subjected to a single 140-V, 10-ms square-wave pulse from a Gene Pulser Xcell (Bio-Rad), and the contents of the cuvette were immediately added to fresh medium. The electroporation conditions were optimized by electroporating 1 μm siGLO cyclophilin B (Dharmacon) and visualizing cellular siRNA uptake by epifluorescence microscopy. The optimized conditions yielded siRNA uptake into >80% of WEHI7.2 cells. Cells were grown in culture post-transfection for 24 h before use in subsequent experiments.IP3R Antisense RNA Repression—The IP3R antisense RNA vector (pcDNA3.1-IP3R-antisense) was created by amplifying the –211 to +466 fragment of IP3R1 from pGEM-T-IP3R1 by PCR and ligating it in reverse orientation into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). WEHI7.2 cells were transfected with the IP3R antisense RNA vector or the empty vector control using the electroporation protocol as described above, and cells were added to a T75 flask with tissue culture medium containing 1 mg/ml G418. Cell populations were monitored daily and split to 100,000 cells/ml if the density approached 1 million cells/ml. After 1 week in selection culture, live cells were isolated with Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. G418-resistant cells were cultured in the continued presence of 1 mg/ml G418 until they were used in experiments.Dexamethasone Binding Assay—Twenty million cells of each type analyzed were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice in fresh medium. Cells were then resuspended at a concentration of 5 million/ml, and 1 ml was transferred to autoclaved glass tubes, four tubes per cell type. [3H]Dexamethasone was then added to each glass tube at a final concentration of 30 nm. Unlabeled dexamethasone was added to two of the four tubes at a final concentration of 3 μm. Cells were then incubated for 2 h, and the incubation was terminated by the addition of 3 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells were centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of culture medium. Following room temperature incubation for 5 min, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of ethanol. Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting, and the specific dexamethasone binding was calculated as the radioactivity in the [3H]dexamethasone-only tube minus the radioactivity in the tube containing [3H]dexamethasone with unlabeled dexamethasone.Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay—Dual-Luciferase reporter assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. Briefly, DT40 cells were electroporated (5 million cells; 0.2-cm cuvette subjected to a single 140-V, 10-ms square-wave pulse) with 50 μg of pTAT3-Luc, which contains three tandem repeats of the glucocorticoid-responsive tyrosine aminotransferase promoter linked to firefly luciferase (gift of Jorge Iniguez-Lluhi, University of Michigan). For a transfection control, cells were electroporated with 5 μg of phRG-TK (Promega), a constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase vector. In addition to the luciferase expression vectors, cells were electroporated with 50 μg of pEmd-C1 (modified pEGFP-C1 vector, Clontech) or pGR-GFP, which is pEmd-C1 containing the rat glucocorticoid receptor cDNA. Transfected cells were treated with 1 μm dexamethasone for 18 h and then harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were washed with PBS, resuspended in Passive lysis buffer solution, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The tubes were then centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 min, and 10 μl of supernatant was added to 96-well plates in duplicate. Luminescence was measured in a PerkinElmer Victor3 plate reader, which measured firefly and Renilla luciferase activity following injection of appropriate substrates. Background luminescence was measured in wells containing 10 μl of water instead of cell supernatant. Promoter activity was quantified by dividing the background-corrected firefly luciferase luminescence by the background-corrected Renilla luciferase luminescence.Statistics—Statistical analyses were performed with Microsoft Excel 2003 using a two-tailed Student's t test.RESULTSIP3R Up-regulation by Dexamethasone—As detailed in earlier reports from our laboratory (15Wang Z.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), two glucocorticoid-sensitive murine T-cell lines, WEHI7.2 and S49.A2, were employed in microarray experiments to identify genes up-regulated by dexamethasone. Briefly, both cell lines were incubated in parallel with 1 μm dexamethasone or ethanol (the vehicle in which dexamethasone was dissolved) for various times, followed by mRNA isolation and hybridization to Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays. Increased hybridization of mRNA from both of the dexamethasone-treated cell lines to oligonucleotide probe sets corresponding to IP3R1 and IP3R2, relative to time matched vehicle controls, was detected (Fig. 1A). Notably, probe sets corresponding to IP3R3 were not present on the arrays. The dexamethasone-mediated up-regulation of IP3R1 and IP3R2 in WEHI7.2 cells was confirmed by Northern hybridization (Fig. 1B) and immunoblotting (Fig. 1C). A more modest elevation of IP3R3 was detected following dexamethasone treatment (Fig. 1C). Dexamethasone also up-regulated IP3Rs in S49.A2 cells, and here also the induction of IP3R1 was more prominent than the induction of IP3R3 (Fig. 1D).Lack of Correlation between IP3R Up-regulation and Calcium Alterations—To assess the potential correlation between IP3R elevation and cytoplasmic calcium elevation, IP3R1 levels and cytoplasmic calcium levels were measured at frequent time points over a 24-h period after adding 1 μm dexamethasone to WEHI7.2 cells (Fig. 2). IP3R1 and IP3R2 elevations were detected by immunoblotting as early as 6 h following dexamethasone addition and were nearly maximal by 10 h (Fig. 2A). Cytoplasmic calcium elevation, measured fluorometrically using the calcium-sensitive dye Fura-2/AM, appeared to lag behind IP3R elevation, being variable (p = 0.31) at 12 h following dexamethasone addition but significant (p ≤ 0.01) at 18 and 24 h after dexamethasone addition (Fig. 2B). Based on single-cell calcium measurements, the calcium elevation appeared throughout the cell population rather than reflecting a large elevation in a subpopulation of cells (data not shown). Although the delay between IP3R elevation and calcium elevation suggests a lack of correlation between these two events, it is possible that because calcium homeostasis is tightly regulated the cell works to maintain calcium homeostasis as long as possible.FIGURE 2Kinetics of IP3R and calcium elevations. A, an immunoblot, representative of multiple experiments, documenting the time course of IP3R1 and IP3R2 elevation in WEHI7.2 cells treated with 1 μm dexamethasone.

As shown in Fig. 3A, the IP3R elevation at 10 nm dexamethasone was just as high as at 0.1 and 1 μm. This observation was highly consistent in five separate experiments. The effect of the same range of dexamethasone concentrations on cytoplasmic calcium concentration and thapsigargin (TG)-induced calcium elevation was measured fluorometrically in Fura-2/AM-loaded cells. Note that extracellular calcium was chelated by EGTA immediately before adding TG. Hence, the cytoplasmic calcium elevation induced by TG is an indirect measure of ER calcium content. A dose-related elevation of cytoplasmic calcium concentration was accompanied by a dose-related decrease in TG-induced peak calcium elevation (Fig. 3, B and C). These findings confirm our earlier evidence that cytoplasmic calcium concentration is elevated and ER lumenal calcium content is decreased following dexamethasone treatment (35Lam M. Dubyak G. Distelhorst C.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, although IP3R elevation is maximal at 0.01 μm dexamethasone, alterations in calcium homeostasis are more prominent at 0.1 and 1 μm dexamethasone than at 0.01 μm dexamethasone. Also, cell death induction occurred earlier in a higher percentage of cells at dexamethasone concentrations in excess of that required to maximally elevate IP3R levels (Fig. 3D). Hence, there is not a strong correlation between IP3R elevation and disrupted either calcium homeostasis or cell death.FIGURE 3Dose-response relationships between IP3R elevation and calcium alterations and cell death.

When expressed in WEHI7.2 cells, this antisense construct markedly inhibited dexamethasone-induced IP3R elevation (Fig. 4A) but did not prevent the dexamethasone-induced elevation of cytoplasmic calcium (Fig. 4B) or the decrease in ER calcium content (Fig. 4C). Moreover, knocking down IP3Rs did not prevent dexamethasone-induced loss of cell viability (measured by trypan blue dye exclusion) (Fig. 4D) or apoptosis (measured by flow cytometry) (Fig. 4E).FIGURE 4Antisense RNA-mediated IP3R repression. WEHI7.2 cells were transfected with empty vector (NeoMix) or vector expressing antisense RNA directed toward all three IP3R isoforms (ASMix), and mixed cell populations (i.e. non-clonal) were selected in G418.

https://openalex.org/W2061749851,"Macrophages are capable of assuming numerous phenotypes in order to adapt to endogenous and exogenous challenges but many of the factors that regulate this process are still unknown. We report that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase alpha (CaMKKalpha) is expressed in human monocytic cells and demonstrate that its inhibition blocks type-II monocytic cell activation and promotes classical activation. Affinity chromatography with paramagnetic beads isolated an approximately 50 kDa protein from nuclear lysates of U937 human monocytic cells activated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). This protein was identified as CaMKKalpha by mass spectrometry and Western analysis. The function of CaMKKalpha in monocyte activation was examined using the CaMKKalpha inhibitors (STO-609 and forskolin) and siRNA knockdown. Inhibition of CaMKKalpha, enhanced PMA-dependent CD86 expression and reduced CD11b expression. In addition, inhibition was associated with decreased translocation of CaMKKalpha to the nucleus. Finally, to further examine monocyte activation profiles, TNFalpha and IL-10 secretion were studied. CaMKKalpha inhibition attenuated PMA-dependent IL-10 production and enhanced TNFalpha production indicating a shift from type-II to classical monocyte activation. Taken together, these findings indicate an important new role for CaMKKalpha in the differentiation of monocytic cells."

Bioinformatic alignments reveal that CPRE-1 sites are evolutionarily conserved in the promoter regions of fish, rodent, and mammalian TαC orthologues and identify a 5′-CTGGAGTG(A/T)TGGA(G/A)GCAGGG(G/C)T-3′ consensus sequence. The vertebrate retina contains distinct cone and rod photoreceptors that mediate scotopic and photopic vision, respectively (1Forrester J.V. Dick A.D. McMenamin P.G. Lee W.R. The Eye: Basic Sciences in Practice. Elsevier Health Sciences, New York2002Google Scholar). Although cones and rods originate from the same population of retinal progenitor cells, they have unique gene expression profiles that account for their differential cell fate, morphology, and signal transduction mechanisms. For example, many components of the G protein-coupled receptor phototransduction cascade are encoded by cone- or rod-specific genes (1Forrester J.V. Dick A.D. McMenamin P.G. Lee W.R. The Eye: Basic Sciences in Practice. Elsevier Health Sciences, New York2002Google Scholar). The molecular genetics underpinning cone photoreceptor-specific gene expression remain poorly defined. Several transcription factors, including Crx, Nr2e3, Nrl, and Trβ2, regulate photoreceptor-specific gene expression. Cone rod homeobox is expressed in photoreceptors, and cone rod homeobox depletion leads to a developmental loss of both cone and rod photoreceptors in mice and zebrafish and to blindness in humans (2Kimble T.D.

Although these transcription factors are known to regulate photoreceptor genes, the molecular regulators of cone-specific gene expression are not well defined.

The cone-specific expression of TαC makes its promoter an ideal candidate for identifying cis-elements controlling cone-specific expression. Previous studies determined that a 277-bp fragment of the human TαC promoter combined with a heterologous 214-bp interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein enhancer element is sufficient to drive expression in murine cones (18Ying S. Fong S.L. Fong W.B. Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Kao W.W. Curr. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 777-782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, characterizing functional TαC cis-elements in mice is limited by the costs and technical expertise associated with transgenics and the limited number of cones in mice. The cost-effective and genetically tractable zebrafish is an attractive alternative model to characterize in vivo, cis-elements controlling cone-specific expression (28Goldsmith P. Harris W.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 29Collery R.F. Cederlund M.L. Smyth V.A. Kennedy B.N. Adv. Exp. Med.

Like humans, zebrafish have unique spectral cone subtypes with distinct cytology and synaptic connectivity that mediate color vision (28Goldsmith P. Harris W.A. Semin. Cell Dev.

Transient transgenic studies identified a 105-bp cis-region of the zebrafish UV opsin promoter that can alter a rod-specific promoter to express in rod and UV cones (15Luo W. Williams J.

Recently a 500-bp region directing M-cone specific expression was identified that is sufficient to induce a non-retinal keratin 8 promoter to express in zebrafish M-cones (32Tsujimura T. Chinen A. Kawamura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12813-12818Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Previously we reported that a 3.2-kb promoter fragment of the zebrafish TαC gene is sufficient to drive strong EGFP expression in zebrafish cone photoreceptors and that the most distal 1.2-kb sequence contains an enhancer-like activity (19Kennedy B.N. Alvarez Y. Brockerhoff S.E. Stearns G.W. Sapetto-Rebow B. Taylor M.R. Hurley J.B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To identify this enhancer of cone-specific expression, we performed an in vivo analysis of the 3.2-kb zebrafish TαC promoter using deletion, mutant and chimeric reporter constructs, and in vitro characterization of binding to eye nuclear protein. Here we describe a novel, evolutionarily conserved 20-bp enhancer of the zebrafish TαC promoter that preferentially binds eye nuclear protein, is active upstream of a heterologous promoter, and is necessary for driving strong cone-specific expression. Generation of Reporter Constructs—The -3173-bp TαCP-EGFP-1 plasmid based on the pEGFP-1 plasmid vector (Clontech) was used as the initial template for all constructs. The -3173(Δ-2698/-2300) deletion was constructed by removing a 397-bp ScaI-BmgBI fragment and re-ligation. The 5′ deletions, internal mutants, -2510/-2501 “RR” repeat and “LR” inversion were generated by introducing PCR fragments into -3173 TαCP-EGFP-1 digested with PstI and EcoRI. The UV zebrafish opsin promoter (zUVOP) was PCR-amplified from a zebrafish genomic library clone (Stratagene) and inserted into the pEGFP-1 vector. Chimeric constructs were engineered by introducing PCR fragments upstream of the -897-bp zUVOP minimal promoter. The 3 and 6 copy repeats of “LR” were generated by cloning synthetic oligonucleotides upstream of the -897-bp zUVOP. A spacer sequence was introduced by PCR-amplifying the kanamycin cassette from the EGFP-1 vector and cloning between the -897-bp zUVOP and enhancer repeat sequence using SpeI restriction sites. The (-2521/-890-bp zTαCP)-(-836-bp human TαC promoter)-EGFP-1 construct was generated by digesting (-2521/-890-bp zTαCP)-(-897-bp zUVOP)-EGFP-1 with SpeI and BamHI and cloning a -836-bp human TαC promoter fragment PCR-amplified from genomic clone pCYPAC2 (RZPD GmBH). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Embryo Microinjections—Covalently closed circular plasmids were suspended in 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.9) plus 0.1% Phenol Red (Sigma) at a final concentration of 25 ng/μl. The pressure injector was regulated so that ∼300 pl (∼7.5 pg) of each reporter construct was injected per embryo. The covalently closed plasmids were injected into the cytoplasm of 1-2 cell stage zebrafish embryos using an air pressure-regulated Pico Pump (World Precision Instruments) attached to a Narishige micromanipulator and needle holder. Injected embryos were transferred to water containing 0.003% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea 24 h post fertilization to inhibit melanin production. Animal studies were sanctioned by the UCD Animal Research Ethics Committee (Ref: P04-18) and licensed by the Department of Health and Children, Rep. of Ireland (License Ref: B100/3358). Screening for EGFP Expression—Injected embryos were anesthetized and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope at 5 days post fertilization (dpf). Construct activity was scored on the basis of a semiquantitative assay, where one of three ordinal activity levels was assigned to an embryo based on the number of fluorescent cells within the eye. Embryos with >50 GFP+ cells in the eye were assigned an activity level of +++, fish with 5-50 GFP+ cells were assigned as ++, 1-5 fluorescent cells as +, and fish with no GFP+ cells were assigned an activity level of - (15Luo W.

The sum of each ordinal level was divided by the total number of embryos to give relative activity. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t tests, and p values of ≤0.05 were considered significant. Immunostaining—Whole mount immunostaining was performed on 5 dpf larvae as described previously (33Barthel L.K. Raymond P.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and analyzed by confocal microscopy (LSM510 Zeiss). For retinal sections, 5-dpf transgenic larvae were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde/5% sucrose/0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Following fixation fish were cryoprotected in 20% sucrose/0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) then infiltrated with OCT (Tissue-TeK) as previously described (33Barthel L.K. Raymond P.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). 12-μm sections were thaw-mounted to Superfrost slides (BDH Chemical Ltd.). Sections were rehydrated in TBS for 30 min, and then incubated for 60 min in blocking buffer (5% normal goat serum/1% bovine serum albumin/1% Triton X-100/TBS). Sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at the following ratios: zpr-1 (1:200, Oregon Monoclonal Bank), UV opsin (1:400), Blue opsin (1:400), and rod opsin (1:200), cone and rod opsin antibodies were generously donated by Profs.

Following three 5-min washes in TBS/0.1% Tween, the sections were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in secondary antibodies diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer. Prior to mounting in Anti-Fade (Molecular Probes), the sections were washed three times for 5 min in TBS. Retinal sections were analyzed by confocal microscopy (LSM510, Zeiss). Nuclear Protein Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from adult zebrafish eyes. Adult zebrafish eyes were dissected and homogenized in 4 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mm Hepes/pH 7.9, 25 mm KCl/5 mm MgCl2/200 mm sucrose/0.5 mm dithiothreitol/0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)), centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was re-suspended in 600 μl of Chelsky buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.0/10 mm NaCl/3 mm MgCl2/30 mm sucrose/1% Nonidet P-40), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were re-suspended in 600 μl of Chelsky buffer plus 10 mm CaCl2, layered on sucrose cushion (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9/25 mm KCl/5 mm MgCl2/876 mm sucrose/0.2 mm EDTA/0.5 mm dithiothreitol/0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were re-suspended in Chelsky buffer c-low salt (20% glycerol/20 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.9/25 mm KCl/0.2 mm EDTA/0.5 mm dithiothreitol/0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), lysed by the dropwise addition of a high salt Chelsky buffer c-low salt plus 1.2 m KCl, and homogenized. Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 13,000-25,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was removed and concentrated by ultra centrifugal filter devices (Amicon ultra 4). Protein content was determined by using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Oligonucleotide probes (supplemental Table S1) were synthesized with 5′ overhangs and radioactively labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow Exo- (New England Biolabs). Nuclear extracts were incubated with a 200-fold molar excess of poly(dI-dC) at 4 °C for 10 min. Labeled probe was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were stopped and loaded on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, followed by autoradiography. For the competition assay, cold competitor was added prior to addition of labeled probe, in 50-, 100-, and 200-fold molar excess. Sequence Analysis—The 10-kb 5′ promoter sequence of GNAT2 genes were obtained from ENSEMBL and aligned with the 20-bp CPRE-1 sequence using ClustalW (35Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2947-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (22841) Google Scholar). Only sequences with a pairwise alignment score greater than 0.61 were considered significant. The consensus CPRE-1 sequences was generated using the online Weblogo server (36Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8449) Google Scholar). A 55-bp Distal Promoter Region Is Necessary for Strong EGFP Expression in Cone Photoreceptors—In transient transgenic assays, the -3173-bp fragment of the zebrafish TαC promoter (TαCP) region drives robust EGFP expression specifically in retinal cone photoreceptors and in the pineal (Fig. 1, data not shown). The expression pattern is identical to that observed in the Tg(3.2TαCP-EGFP-1) transgenic line generated using the same promoter fragment (19Kennedy B.N. Alvarez Y. Brockerhoff S.E. Stearns G.W. Sapetto-Rebow B. Taylor M.R. Hurley J.B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To identify cis-elements controlling this cone photoreceptor-specific expression, we tested the reporter activity of a series of 5′ deletions of the -3173-bp TαCP in vivo. Deletion of the region between -3173 and -2749-bp of zebrafish TαCP results in a significant reduction of reporter activity, revealing a potential enhancer element, designated “enhancer region 2,” within this 424-bp region (Fig. 1A). However, deletion of the 283-bp region between -2749 and -2466-bp of the TαCP, designated “enhancer region 1,” practically abolishes EGFP expression (Fig. 1A). An internal deletion of enhancer region 1, within the -3173 bp TαCP construct, results in minimal reporter activity (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that enhancer region 1 is necessary for high level cone-specific expression and that enhancer region 2 is not sufficient to compensate for loss of enhancer region 1. We focused on refining the enhancer element (enhancer-1) in enhancer region 1. Analyses of additional 5′ deletions initially narrowed enhancer-1 to the 55-bp region, between -2521 and -2466 bp of TαCP (Fig. 1A). The -2521-bp TαCP construct results in robust expression, with >34% of injected embryos expressing EGFP in the retina. The -2521-bp TαCP-EGFP construct confines transgene expression to all cone photoreceptor types based on expression in the outer nuclear layer and co-immunolocalization of EGFP with markers for double, short single, and long single cones, but not with a rod photoreceptor marker (Fig. 1, C-F, and Table 1). Deletion of the 55 bp between -2521 and -2466 bp of TαCP results in a significant loss of EGFP expression, with <10% of injected embryos expressing EGFP in only in one to five cells per eye (Fig. 1A).TABLE 1Number of EGFP+ cells from transient transgenic fish sections that label with rod or cone opsin antibodiesZpr-1UV opsinBlue opsinRhodopsin−3173 bp TaCP-EGFP-15 (22)5 (19)7 (20)0 (12)−2521 bp TaCP-EGFP-14 (8)2 (9)2 (15)0 (18)−2521/−890 bp TaCP/800 bp zUVOP-EGFP-10 (6)5 (5)0 (5)0 (6) Open table in a new tab Eye Nuclear Protein Binds Specifically to Enhancer-1—The ability of enhancer-1 to bind eye nuclear protein was evaluated by testing three overlapping oligonucleotide probes that span the 55-bp sequence of -2521 to -2466 bp of TαCP (Fig. 2A). Probe 1 and Probe 2 form distinct complexes with eye nuclear protein, but Probe 1 became the focus of our studies as it generates a more intense complex (Fig. 2B). The specificity of eye nuclear protein binding to Probe 1 was analyzed. Addition of Probe 1 as a cold competitor at 50 and 100 m excess demonstrates a specific ability of unlabeled Probe 1 to compete for nuclear proteins binding to Probe 1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). An unrelated competitor is unable to compete away binding of nuclear protein to Probe 1 (Fig. 2C). In addition, non-retinal nuclear protein isolated from zebrafish body is capable of binding to Probe 1, although at a much reduced intensity compared with eye nuclear protein (Fig. 2C). This suggests an enrichment of trans-factors in the eye that specifically bind to enhancer-1. CPRE-1 Comprises Two 10-bp Functional cis-Elements—To narrow the minimal sequence of enhancer-1, three mutant probes containing sequential 10-bp mutations were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3A). The three mutant probes fail to form a complex with eye nuclear protein (Fig. 3B). However, when used as cold competitors, Probe 1M R is unable to compete, Probe 1M L partially competes, and Probe 1M D efficiently competes away binding of eye nuclear protein to wild-type Probe 1 (Fig. 3B). Thus, the 20 bp spanning Probes 1M L and 1M R, designated “cone photoreceptor regulatory element 1” (CPRE-1) appear essential for trans-factor(s) binding to enhancer-1 (Fig. 3A). To test the significance of CPRE-1 for transcriptional activity in vivo, constructs containing complete or partial deletions of CPRE-1 were tested (Fig. 3C). The -2501-bp TαCP-EGFP construct had limited activity compared with the -2521 bp TαCP-EGFP construct demonstrating that CPRE-1 is necessary for robust cone-specific expression (Fig. 3C). 5′ deletion of the sequence from -2521 and -2510 bp of TαCP resulted in a significant loss of EGFP expression, and deletion of the sequence from -2510 and -2501 bp of TαCP results in a further statistically significant loss of EGFP expression (Fig. 3, C and D). The in vitro and in vivo assays suggest that CPRE-1 comprises two separate cis-elements, “R” located between -2521 and -2510 bp of TαCP and “L” located between -2510 and -2501 bp of TαCP. To identify the functional importance of the L and R cis-elements, they were mutated independently in the -2521-bp background and tested in vivo. Mutation of either L or R results in a significant loss of transcriptional activity compared with the -2521-bp TαCP construct, with mutation of R having a more pronounced affect (Fig. 3, C and D). However, duplication of R is insufficient to recapitulate the transgene expression levels of the L plus R arrangement, demonstrating a co-dependence of the modules for enhanced transcriptional activation (Fig. 3, C and D). The ability of CPRE-1 to increase transcription appears orientation-dependent as inverting and reversing the L and R modules results in a significant reduction in transgene expression, compared with their wild-type orientation (Fig. 3, C and D). Identification of L and R Sequences Essential for trans-Factor(s) Binding—To identify the base pairs necessary for binding of trans-factor(s) to CPRE-1, the ability of L and R probes, with consecutive 3-bp mutations, to bind eye nuclear protein was tested (Fig. 4, A and B). The 6-bp sequence from -2518 to -2512 bp (5′-GAGTGT) of L is essential for binding, because mutation of these residues in Probes 1M L.2 and 1M L.3 abolishes the ability to form a complex with eye nuclear protein and to compete with binding to wild-type Probe 1 (Fig. 4C and Table 2). For R, only the 3-bp sequence from -2507 to -2504 bp (5′-GGC), mutated in Probe 1M R.2, is essential for binding (Fig. 4D and Table 2). The sequen"

Here we demonstrate that HLA-DR alpha 2 domain (sHLA-DRα2) also induces negative signals by engaging TIRC7 on lymphocytes. This interaction inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells via activation of the intrinsic pathway. Proliferation inhibition is associated with SHP-1 recruitment by TIRC7, decreased phosphorylation of STAT4, TCR-ζ chain & ZAP70, and inhibition of IFN-γ and FasL expression. HLA-DRα2 and TIRC7 co-localize at the APC-T cell interaction site. Triggering HLA-DR - TIRC7 pathway demonstrates that sHLA-DRα2 treatment inhibits proinflammatory-inflammatory cytokine expression in APC & T cells after lipopolysaccaride (LPS) stimulation in vitro and induces apoptosis in vivo. These results suggest a novel antiproliferative role for HLA-DR mediated via TIRC7, revise the notion of an exclusive stimulatory interaction of HLA-DR with CD4+ T cells and highlights a novel physiologically relevant regulatory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2004492407,"Protein sequence similarity is a commonly used criterion for inferring the unknown function of a protein from a protein of known function. However, proteins can diverge significantly over time such that sequence similarity is difficult, if not impossible, to find. In some cases, a structural similarity remains over long evolutionary time scales and once detected can be used to predict function.Here we employed a high-throughput approach to assign structural and functional annotation to the human proteome, focusing on the collection of human protein kinases, the human kinome. We compared human protein sequences to a library of domains from known structures using WU-BLAST, PSI-BLAST, and 123D. This approach utilized both sequence comparison and fold recognition methods. The resulting set of potential protein kinases was cross-checked against previously identified human protein kinases, and analyzed for conserved kinase motifs.We demonstrate that our structure-based method can be used to identify both typical and atypical human protein kinases. We also identify two potentially novel kinases that contain an interesting combination of kinase and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase domains."
