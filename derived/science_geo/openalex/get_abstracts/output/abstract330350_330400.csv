https://openalex.org/W2042336747,"Steroids are used to illustrate some of the significant advances that have been made in recent years in understanding the biological origin and geological fate of the organic compounds in sediments. The precursor sterols are transformed, initially by microbial activity and later by physicochemical constraints, into thermodynamically more stable saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons in mature sediments and petroleums. The steps in this transformation result in a complex web linking biogenesis, diagenesis, and catagenesis. Indeed, the complexity and variety of biological lipids such as the steroids are evidently matched in the corresponding geolipids. The extent of preservation of the biochemical imprint in the structures and stereochemistry of these geolipids, even over hundreds of millions of years, is startling, as is the systematic and sequential nature of the geochemical changes they evidently undergo. This new understanding of molecular organic geochemistry has applications in petroleum geochemistry, where biological marker compounds are valuable in the assessment of sediment maturity and in correlation work."

https://openalex.org/W2012743066,"The science of chemistry and chemicals will continue to be an integral part of future crop production technologies. In assessing and defining the future role of chemistry three imperatives must be considered: (i) the necessity to preserve natural resources, (ii) the complementary solutions offered by the rapidly advancing biological sciences, and (iii) the specific requirements of developing regions where increasing crop productivity is most important. Chemical research objectives for improving crop protection and crop growth must take into account the perceivable and potential changes in crop production techniques, which, in turn, are dictated by a number of accentuating constraints."
