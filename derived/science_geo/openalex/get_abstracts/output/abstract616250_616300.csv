https://openalex.org/W2886752110,"A key public health need is to identify individuals at high risk for a given disease to enable enhanced screening or preventive therapies. Because most common diseases have a genetic component, one important approach is to stratify individuals based on inherited DNA variation1. Proposed clinical applications have largely focused on finding carriers of rare monogenic mutations at several-fold increased risk. Although most disease risk is polygenic in nature2-5, it has not yet been possible to use polygenic predictors to identify individuals at risk comparable to monogenic mutations. Here, we develop and validate genome-wide polygenic scores for five common diseases. The approach identifies 8.0, 6.1, 3.5, 3.2, and 1.5% of the population at greater than threefold increased risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer, respectively. For coronary artery disease, this prevalence is 20-fold higher than the carrier frequency of rare monogenic mutations conferring comparable risk6. We propose that it is time to contemplate the inclusion of polygenic risk prediction in clinical care, and discuss relevant issues."
https://openalex.org/W2886281300,"The volume and complexity of diagnostic imaging is increasing at a pace faster than the availability of human expertise to interpret it. Artificial intelligence has shown great promise in classifying two-dimensional photographs of some common diseases and typically relies on databases of millions of annotated images. Until now, the challenge of reaching the performance of expert clinicians in a real-world clinical pathway with three-dimensional diagnostic scans has remained unsolved. Here, we apply a novel deep learning architecture to a clinically heterogeneous set of three-dimensional optical coherence tomography scans from patients referred to a major eye hospital. We demonstrate performance in making a referral recommendation that reaches or exceeds that of experts on a range of sight-threatening retinal diseases after training on only 14,884 scans. Moreover, we demonstrate that the tissue segmentations produced by our architecture act as a device-independent representation; referral accuracy is maintained when using tissue segmentations from a different type of device. Our work removes previous barriers to wider clinical use without prohibitive training data requirements across multiple pathologies in a real-world setting."
https://openalex.org/W2950099124,"In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for thousands of phenotypes in large biobanks, most binary traits have substantially fewer cases than controls. Both of the widely used approaches, the linear mixed model and the recently proposed logistic mixed model, perform poorly; they produce large type I error rates when used to analyze unbalanced case-control phenotypes. Here we propose a scalable and accurate generalized mixed model association test that uses the saddlepoint approximation to calibrate the distribution of score test statistics. This method, SAIGE (Scalable and Accurate Implementation of GEneralized mixed model), provides accurate P values even when case-control ratios are extremely unbalanced. SAIGE uses state-of-art optimization strategies to reduce computational costs; hence, it is applicable to GWAS for thousands of phenotypes by large biobanks. Through the analysis of UK Biobank data of 408,961 samples from white British participants with European ancestry for > 1,400 binary phenotypes, we show that SAIGE can efficiently analyze large sample data, controlling for unbalanced case-control ratios and sample relatedness."
https://openalex.org/W2887361912,"T cell dysfunction contributes to tumor immune escape in patients with cancer and is particularly severe amidst glioblastoma (GBM). Among other defects, T cell lymphopenia is characteristic, yet often attributed to treatment. We reveal that even treatment-naïve subjects and mice with GBM can harbor AIDS-level CD4 counts, as well as contracted, T cell-deficient lymphoid organs. Missing naïve T cells are instead found sequestered in large numbers in the bone marrow. This phenomenon characterizes not only GBM but a variety of other cancers, although only when tumors are introduced into the intracranial compartment. T cell sequestration is accompanied by tumor-imposed loss of S1P1 from the T cell surface and is reversible upon precluding S1P1 internalization. In murine models of GBM, hindering S1P1 internalization and reversing sequestration licenses T cell-activating therapies that were previously ineffective. Sequestration of T cells in bone marrow is therefore a tumor-adaptive mode of T cell dysfunction, whose reversal may constitute a promising immunotherapeutic adjunct."

https://openalex.org/W2953270703,"The genomic complexity of profound copy number aberrations has prevented effective molecular stratification of ovarian cancers. Here, to decode this complexity, we derived copy number signatures from shallow whole-genome sequencing of 117 high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cases, which were validated on 527 independent cases. We show that HGSOC comprises a continuum of genomes shaped by multiple mutational processes that result in known patterns of genomic aberration. Copy number signature exposures at diagnosis predict both overall survival and the probability of platinum-resistant relapse. Measurement of signature exposures provides a rational framework to choose combination treatments that target multiple mutational processes. The authors identify copy number signatures from shallow whole-genome sequencing of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cases. HGSOC comprises a continuum of genomes shaped by multiple mutational processes that result in genomic aberration."
https://openalex.org/W2887114149,"Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons have diverse functions that can in part be explained by their heterogeneity. Although molecularly distinct subtypes of DA neurons have been identified by single-cell gene expression profiling, fundamental features such as their projection patterns have not been elucidated. Progress in this regard has been hindered by the lack of genetic tools for studying DA neuron subtypes. Here we develop intersectional genetic labeling strategies, based on combinatorial gene expression, to map the projections of molecularly defined DA neuron subtypes. We reveal distinct genetically defined dopaminergic pathways arising from the substantia nigra pars compacta and from the ventral tegmental area that innervate specific regions of the caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Together, the genetic toolbox and DA neuron subtype projections presented here constitute a resource that will accelerate the investigation of this clinically significant neurotransmitter system."
https://openalex.org/W2887730046,"Oncogenic alterations in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway drive the growth of a wide spectrum of cancers. While BRAF and MEK inhibitors are efficacious against BRAFV600E-driven cancers, effective targeted therapies are lacking for most cancers driven by other pathway alterations, including non-V600E oncogenic BRAF, RAS GTPase-activating protein (GAP) NF1 (neurofibromin 1) loss and oncogenic KRAS. Here, we show that targeting the SHP2 phosphatase (encoded by PTPN11) with RMC-4550, a small-molecule allosteric inhibitor, is effective in human cancer models bearing RAS-GTP-dependent oncogenic BRAF (for example, class 3 BRAF mutants), NF1 loss or nucleotide-cycling oncogenic RAS (for example, KRASG12C). SHP2 inhibitor treatment decreases oncogenic RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signalling and cancer growth by disrupting SOS1-mediated RAS-GTP loading. Our findings illuminate a critical function for SHP2 in promoting oncogenic RAS/MAPK pathway activation in cancers with RAS-GTP-dependent oncogenic BRAF, NF1 loss and nucleotide-cycling oncogenic KRAS. SHP2 inhibition is a promising molecular therapeutic strategy for patients with cancers bearing these oncogenic drivers."
https://openalex.org/W2887191265,"We developed a likelihood-based approach for analyzing summary-level statistics and external linkage disequilibrium information to estimate effect-size distributions of common variants, characterized by the proportion of underlying susceptibility SNPs and a flexible normal-mixture model for their effects. Analysis of results available across 32 genome-wide association studies showed that, while all traits are highly polygenic, there is wide diversity in the degree and nature of polygenicity. Psychiatric diseases and traits related to mental health and ability appear to be most polygenic, involving a continuum of small effects. Most other traits, including major chronic diseases, involve clusters of SNPs that have distinct magnitudes of effects. We predict that the sample sizes needed to identify SNPs that explain most heritability found in genome-wide association studies will range from a few hundred thousand to multiple millions, depending on the underlying effect-size distributions of the traits. Accordingly, we project the risk-prediction ability of polygenic risk scores across a wide variety of diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2886507777,"Heritability measures the proportion of trait variation that is due to genetic inheritance. Measurement of heritability is important in the nature-versus-nurture debate. However, existing estimates of heritability may be biased by environmental effects. Here, we introduce relatedness disequilibrium regression (RDR), a novel method for estimating heritability. RDR avoids most sources of environmental bias by exploiting variation in relatedness due to random Mendelian segregation. We used a sample of 54,888 Icelanders who had both parents genotyped to estimate the heritability of 14 traits, including height (55.4%, s.e. 4.4%) and educational attainment (17.0%, s.e. 9.4%). Our results suggest that some other estimates of heritability may be inflated by environmental effects."
https://openalex.org/W2889584720,"The atomic nucleus is one of the densest and most complex quantum-mechanical systems in nature. Nuclei account for nearly all the mass of the visible Universe. The properties of individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) in nuclei can be probed by scattering a high-energy particle from the nucleus and detecting this particle after it scatters, often also detecting an additional knocked-out proton. Analysis of electron- and proton-scattering experiments suggests that some nucleons in nuclei form close-proximity neutron-proton pairs1-12 with high nucleon momentum, greater than the nuclear Fermi momentum. However, how excess neutrons in neutron-rich nuclei form such close-proximity pairs remains unclear. Here we measure protons and, for the first time, neutrons knocked out of medium-to-heavy nuclei by high-energy electrons and show that the fraction of high-momentum protons increases markedly with the neutron excess in the nucleus, whereas the fraction of high-momentum neutrons decreases slightly. This effect is surprising because in the classical nuclear shell model, protons and neutrons obey Fermi statistics, have little correlation and mostly fill independent energy shells. These high-momentum nucleons in neutron-rich nuclei are important for understanding nuclear parton distribution functions (the partial momentum distribution of the constituents of the nucleon) and changes in the quark distributions of nucleons bound in nuclei (the EMC effect)1,13,14. They are also relevant for the interpretation of neutrino-oscillation measurements15 and understanding of neutron-rich systems such as neutron stars3,16."

https://openalex.org/W2887711694,"Voluntary urination ensures that waste is eliminated when safe and socially appropriate, even without a pressing urge. Uncontrolled urination, or incontinence, is a common problem with few treatment options. Normal urine release requires a small region in the brainstem known as Barrington’s nucleus (Bar), but specific neurons that relax the urethral sphincter and enable urine flow are unknown. Here we identify a small subset of Bar neurons that control the urethral sphincter in mice. These excitatory neurons express estrogen receptor 1 (BarESR1), project to sphincter-relaxing interneurons in the spinal cord and are active during natural urination. Optogenetic stimulation of BarESR1 neurons rapidly initiates sphincter bursting and efficient voiding in anesthetized and behaving animals. Conversely, optogenetic and chemogenetic inhibition reveals their necessity in motivated urination behavior. The identification of these cells provides an expanded model for the control of urination and its dysfunction. Controlling urination is a fundamental social need. Keller et al. develop a voluntary urination assay and uncover a subset of brainstem neurons that relax the urethral sphincter, providing insight into urinary control and its dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2789622920,"Interest in reconstructing demographic histories has motivated the development of methods to estimate locus-specific pairwise coalescence times from whole-genome sequencing data. Here we introduce a powerful new method, ASMC, that can estimate coalescence times using only SNP array data, and is orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches. We applied ASMC to detect recent positive selection in 113,851 phased British samples from the UK Biobank, and detected 12 genome-wide significant signals, including 6 novel loci. We also applied ASMC to sequencing data from 498 Dutch individuals to detect background selection at deeper time scales. We detected strong heritability enrichment in regions of high background selection in an analysis of 20 independent diseases and complex traits using stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression, conditioned on a broad set of functional annotations (including other background selection annotations). These results underscore the widespread effects of background selection on the genetic architecture of complex traits. ASMC is a new method to estimate coalescence times using SNP array or sequencing data. When applied to data from the UK Biobank or Genome of the Netherlands, ASMC detects signals of recent positive selection and background selection."

https://openalex.org/W2885319787,"Wheat is a staple food crop of many countries. Improving resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses remain key breeding targets. Among these, rust diseases are the most detrimental in terms of depressing wheat production. In the present study, chemical mutagenesis was used to induce mutations in the wheat variety NN-Gandum-1. This cultivar is moderately resistant to leaf and yellow rust. The aim of mutagenesis was to improve resistance to the disease as well as to study function of genes conferring resistance to the disease. In the present investigation, a 0.8% EMS dose was found optimum for supporting 45–55% germination of NN-Gandum-1. A total of 3,634 M2 fertile plants were produced from each of the M1 plant. Out of these, 33 (0.91%) and 20 plants (0.55%) showed absolute resistance to leaf and yellow rust, respectively. While 126 (3.46%) and 127 plants (3.49%) exhibited high susceptibility to the leaf and yellow rust, respectively. In the M4 generation, a total of 11 M4 lines (nine absolute resistant and two highly susceptible) and one wild type were selected for NGS-based exome capture assay. A total of 104,779 SNPs were identified that were randomly distributed throughout the wheat sub genomes (A, B and D). Induced mutations in intronic sequences predominated. The highest total number of SNPs detected in this assay were mapped to chr.2B (14,273 SNPs), which contains the highest number of targeted base pairs in the assay. The average mutation density across all regions interrogated was estimated to be one mutation per 20.91 Mb. The highest mutation frequency was found in chr.2D (1/11.7 kb) and the lowest in chr.7D (1/353.4 kb). Out of the detected mutations, 101 SNPs were filtered using analysis criteria aimed to enrich for mutations that may affect gene function. Out of these, one putative SNP detected in Lr21 were selected for further analysis. The SNP identified in chimeric allele (Lr21) of a resistant mutant (N1-252) was located in a NBS domain of chr.1BS at 3.4 Mb position. Through computational analysis, it was demonstrated that this identified SNP causes a substitution of glutamic acid with alanine, resulting in a predicted altered protein structure. This mutation, therefore, is a candidate for contributing to the resistance phenotype in the mutant line. Based on this work, we conclude that the wheat mutant resource developed is useful as a source of novel genetic variation for forward-genetic screens and also as a useful tool for gaining insights into the important biological circuits of different traits of complex genomes like wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2887435293,"The consumption of soybean protein has well-known favorable metabolic effects (e.g., reduced body weight, body fat, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and lipogenesis). These effects of soy protein have been linked to modulation by the gut microbiota; however, the dynamic interplay among these factors remains unclear. Accordingly, we examined the metabolic phenotype, intestinal BA pool, and the gut microbiome of male C57BL/6 mice that were randomized to receive either a regular high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD that contained soybean protein isolate (SPI) in place of dairy protein. The intake of SPI significantly reduced the HFD-induced weight gain and adipose tissue mass accumulation and attenuated hepatic steatosis. Along with an enhancement in the secretion of intestinal Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an enlarged cecal BA pool with an elevated secondary/primary BA ratio was observed in the mice that consumed SPI, while fecal BA excretion remained unaltered. SPI also elicited dramatic changes in the gut microbiome, characterized by an expansion of taxa that may be involved in the biotransformation of BAs. The observed effects were abolished in germ-free (GF) mice, indicating that they were dependent on the microbiota. These findings collectively indicate that the metabolic benefits of SPI under the HFD regime may arise from a microbiota-driven increase in BA transformation and increase in GLP-1 secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2885895228,"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been used as a powerful technology for molecular epidemiology, surveillance, identification of species and serotype, identification of the sources of outbreaks, among other purposes. In Brazil, there is relatively few epidemiological data on Salmonella. In this study, 90 Salmonella Typhimurium strains had their genome sequenced to uncover the diversity of Salmonella Typhimurium isolated from humans and food, between 1983 and 2013, from different geographic regions in Brazil based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. A total of 39 resistance genes were identified, such as aminoglycoside, tetracycline, sulfonamide, trimethoprim, beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone, phenicol and macrolide, as well as the occurrence of point mutations in some of the genes such as gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE. A total of 65 (72.2%) out of 90 S. Typhimurium strains studied were phenotypically resistant to sulfonamides, 44 (48.9%) strains were streptomycin resistant, 27 (30%) strains were resistant to tetracycline, 21 (23.3%) strains were gentamicin resistant, and seven (7.8%) strains were resistant to ceftriaxone. In the gyrA gene, it was observed the following amino acid substitutions: Asp(87)→Gly, Asp(87)→Asn, Ser(83)→Phe, Ser(83)→Tyr. Phylogenetic results placed the 90 S. Typhimurium strains into two major clades suggesting the existence of a prevalent subtype, likely more adapted, among strains isolated from humans, with some diversity in subtypes in foods. The variety and prevalence of resistant genes found in these Salmonella Typhimurium strains reinforces their potential hazard for humans and the risk in foods in Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W2887103830,"Background/Purpose Ankle sprains are common and potentially disabling musculoskeletal injuries that often lead to chronic ankle instability (CAI). CAI has been linked to impairments in postural and neuromuscular control; however, inconsistent findings have been reported. Individuals who experience a lateral ankle sprain, but do not develop instability, termed copers, may adapt different neuromuscular control strategies after injury. This study aimed to compare postural control and electromyographic (EMG) activity of hip and ankle muscles during the performance of the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) in subjects with and without CAI. Method 48 participants were classified into three groups (16 control, 16 copers, 16 CAI) based on ankle sprain history and Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool score. Outcome measures included normalized reach distance, center of pressure (COP), and integrated EMG activation of gluteus medius (Gmed), gluteus maximus (Gmax), tibialis anterior (TA), and peroneus longus (PL) during each reach direction of SEBT. Results Compared to copers and controls, CAI group demonstrated significantly diminished postural control (reach distance and COP measures, p< 0.05) and less EMG activity of TA during the anterior direction (CAI: 33.1% ± 10.1% versus copers: 44.8% ± 12.7% versus controls: 51.7% ± 8.4%, p<0.01) and Gmax in the posterolateral direction (CAI: 25.6% ± 9.4% versus copers: 37.5% ± 13.8% versus controls: 40.2% ± 17.2%, p = 0.011). Conclusion Alteration in proximal and distal muscle activity appears to negatively affect postural control and quality of movement, which may lead to prolonged functional impairments. Hence, implementing hip and ankle muscle exercises in the rehabilitation of ankle instability might benefit these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2885871588,"While there is increasing evidence for habitat specialization in coral reef fishes, the extent to which different corals support different fish communities is not well understood. Here we quantitatively assess the relative importance of different coral species in structuring fish communities and evaluate whether sampling scale and coral colony size affect the perceived strength of fish-habitat relationships. Fish communities present on colonies of eight coral species (Porites cylindrica, Echinopora horrida, Hydnophora rigida, Stylophora pistillata, Seriatopora hystrix, Acropora formosa, A. tenuis and A. millepora) were examined in the Lizard Island lagoon, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Additionally, the differences in fish communities supported by three coral species (P. cylindrica, E. horrida, H. rigida) were investigated at three spatial scales of sampling (2x2 m, 1x1 m, 0.5x0.5 m). Substantial differences in fish communities were observed across the different coral species, with E. horrida and H. rigida supporting the most fish species and individuals. Coral species explained more of the variability in fish species richness (20.9-53.6%), than in fish abundance (0-15%). Most coral species supported distinctive fish communities, with dissimilarities ranging from 50 to 90%. For three focal coral species, a greater amount of total variation in fish species richness and fish abundance was evident at a larger scale of sampling. Together, these results indicate that the structure of reef fish communities is finely tuned to coral species. Loss of preferred coral species could have profound effects on reef fish biodiversity, potentially more so than would be predicted on the basis of declining coral cover alone."
https://openalex.org/W2886813680,"Background Fluid overload is common among asymptomatic peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We aim to determine the prevalence and prognostic significance of fluid overload, as measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy, in asymptomatic incident PD patients. Methods We performed a single-center study on 311 incident PD patients. Volume status was represented by the volume of overhydration (OH), OH/extracellular water (ECW) ratio, ECW/total body water (TBW) ratio, and ECW to intracellular water (ICW) ratio (E:I ratio). Patient survival, technique survival and cardiovascular event-free survival were determined. Results The median period of follow up was 27.3 months. Fluid overload was present in 272 patients (87.5%) when defined as OH volume over 1.1L. All hydration parameters significantly correlated with Charlson Comorbidity Index, and inversely with total Kt/V, and serum albumin. Multivariate cause-specific Cox analysis showed that volume status independently predicted patient survival; every 0.1 unit increase in E:I ratio was associated with 24.5% increase in all-cause mortality (adjusted cause-specific hazard ratio [ACSHR] 1.245, p = 0.002). Hydration status was also an independent predictor of cardiovascular event-free survival after excluding hospital admission for congestive heart failure; each 0.1 unit increase in E:I ratio was associated with 18.7% decrease in cardiovascular event-free survival (ACSHR 1.187, p = 0.011). In contrast, hydration parameters were not associated with technique survival. Conclusions Fluid overload is common in asymptomatic incident PD patients and is a strong predictor of patient survival and cardiovascular event. The impact of bioimpedance spectroscopy-guided fluid management on the outcome of PD patients deserves further study."
https://openalex.org/W2885341819,"The new Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay (Ultra, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA) is a cartridge-based automated diagnostic test that can simultaneously identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB) and resistance to Rifampicin (RIF). With respect to the previous version Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert), IS6110/IS1081 repetitive elements probes have been added allowing the detection of lower MTB load, defined by the new semi-quantitative category ""trace"" with indeterminate RIF resistance. The aim of this study was to evaluate performance of the new version Ultra on Xpert-negative, but TB culture-positive clinical samples.The de-identified frozen samples (-20 °C) collected over a 4-year period (February 2014-October 2017), which had previously resulted smear-negative, Xpert-negative but MTB culture-positive, were analyzed with Ultra. The de-frosted samples were loaded into the cartridge using the same process as the previous version, according to manufacturer's instruction.During the study period 382 MTB culture-positive samples were archived: 314 resulted Xpert-positive and 68 Xpert-negative. Thirty-one of the 68 Xpert-negative samples resulted positive with Ultra, with an overall improvement in MTB detection of 45.6%. Out of 36 Xpert-negative respiratory samples, 18 resulted Ultra-positive with the following semi-quantitative loads: ""low""(n = 1), ""very low""(n = 11), ""trace""(n = 6), with an improvement in MTB detection of 50%. The best performance was achieved on bronchoalveolar lavage specimens (53.8%). Out of 32 Xpert-negative non-respiratory samples, 13 resulted Ultra-positive with the following semi-quantitative loads: ""very low""(n = 7), ""trace""(n = 6), with an improvement in MTB detection of 40.6%. The best performance was achieved on biopsies (55.6%) and lymph nodes (50%). The new category ""trace"" detected 12 out of the 31 Ultra-positive MTB samples; in the remaining 19 samples RIF susceptibility was determined with 100% concordance with the phenotypic susceptibility test. The mean time to positivity of samples found negative by Ultra was significantly longer in comparison to positive samples in liquid culture.Our results are consistent with the few studies published so far and confirm the better performance of Ultra compared to the previous version in both respiratory and non-respiratory smear-negative samples, with an overall improvement of 45.6%."

https://openalex.org/W2887957127,"Despite recent improvement in adjuvant therapies, triple-negative, and ER+ subtypes of breast cancer (BC) with metastatic potentials remain the leading cause of BC-related deaths. We investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase alpha (PIP5Kα), a key upstream factor of PI3K/AKT, and the therapeutic effect of PIP5Kα inhibitor on subtypes of BC. The clinical importance of PIP5K1α and its association with survivals were analyzed using three BC cohorts from Nottingham (n = 913), KM plotter (n = 112) and TCGA (n = 817). Targeted overexpression or knockdown of PIP5K1α were introduced into BC cell lines. The effects of PIP5K1α and its inhibitor on growth and invasion of BC were confirmed by using in vitro assays including proliferation, migration, apoptosis and luciferase reporter assays and in vivo xenograft mouse models. All statistical tests were two-sided. PIP5K1α was associated with poor patient outcome in triple-negative BC (for PIP5K1α protein, p = 0.011 and for mRNA expression, p = 0.028, log-rank test). 29% of triple-negative BC had PIP5K1A gene amplification. Elevated level of PIP5K1α increased expression of pSer-473 AKT (p < 0.001) and invasiveness of triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells (p < 0.001). Conversely, inhibition of PIP5K1α using its inhibitor ISA-2011B, or via knockdown suppressed growth and invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 xenografts (mean vehicle-treated controls = 2160 mm3, and mean ISA-2011B-treated = 600 mm3, p < 0.001). ISA-2011B-treatment reduced expression of pSer-473 AKT (p < 0.001) and its downstream effectors including cyclin D1, VEGF and its receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 (p < 0.001) in xenograft tumors. In ER+ cancer cells, PIP5K1α acted on pSer-473 AKT, and was in complexes with VEGFR2, serving as co-factor of ER-alpha to regulate activities of target genes including cyclin D1 and CDK1. Our study suggests that our developed PIP5K1α inhibitor has a great potential on refining targeted therapeutics for treatment of triple-negative and ER+ BC with abnormal PI3K/AKT pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2886631752,"Devil Facial Tumor Disease (DFTD) is an aggressive cancer notorious for its rare etiology and its impact on Tasmanian devil populations. Two regions underlying an evolutionary response to this cancer were recently identified using genomic time-series pre- and post-DTFD arrival. Here, we support that DFTD shaped the genome of the Tasmanian devil in an even more extensive way than previously reported. We detected 97 signatures of selection, including 148 protein coding genes having a human orthologue, linked to DFTD. Most candidate genes are associated with cancer progression, and an important subset of candidate genes has additional influence on social behavior. This confirms the influence of cancer on the ecology and evolution of the Tasmanian devil. Our work also demonstrates the possibility to detect highly polygenic footprints of short-term selection in very small populations."

In order to incorporate novel fluorescence imaging properties, we have fused a lanthanide binding tag (LBT) to the C-terminal end of mouse H-chain ferritin, HFt. The HFt-LBT possesses one high affinity Terbium binding site per each of the 24 subunits provided by six coordinating aminoacid side chains and a tryptophan residue in its close proximity and is thus endowed with strong FRET sensitization properties. Accordingly, the characteristic Terbium emission band at 544 nm for the HFt-LBT Tb(III) complex was detectable upon excitation of the tag enclosed at two order of magnitude higher intensity with respect to the wtHFt protein. X-ray data at 2.9 Å and cryo-EM at 7 Å resolution demonstrated that HFt-LBT is correctly assembled as a 24-mer both in crystal and in solution. On the basis of the intrinsic Tb(III) binding properties of the wt protein, 32 additional Tb(III) binding sites, located within the natural iron binding sites of the protein, were identified besides the 24 Tb(III) ions coordinated to the LBTs. HFt-LBT Tb(III) was demonstrated to be actively uptaken by selected tumor cell lines by confocal microscopy and FACS analysis of their FITC derivatives, although direct fluorescence from Terbium emission could not be singled out with conventional, 295–375 nm, fluorescence excitation."
https://openalex.org/W2885165758,"The continuous degradation of mangrove habitats has encouraged governments and multi-lateral agencies to undertake rehabilitation initiatives to foster the recovery and biodiversity of these areas. However, some rehabilitation initiatives suffer high mortality because of incorrect species-site matching and failure to recognize the ecophysiology of mangrove species. This study investigated the effects of salinity, water depth and inundation on the growth, biochemical stress responses, and ecophysiology of Rhizophora stylosa in greenhouse conditions. Propagules were cultured in aquarium tanks and irrigated with low (0 ppt), moderate (20 ppt), and high (35 ppt) salinity treatments. In the first setup, the seedlings were cultured in aquarium tanks and arranged on the top of a platform at different elevations, subjecting the seedlings to flooding with low-water (3–5 cm), mid-water (10–13 cm) and high-water (30–33 cm) levels for ten months. In another setup, the seedlings were cultured for 15 months at the low-water level and subjected to inundation hydroperiods: semi-diurnal, diurnal and permanent inundation for one week. These microcosms simulated emerged and submerged conditions, mimicking intertidal inundation that seedlings would experience. The results showed that salinity significantly affected the early development of the cultured seedlings with higher growth rates and biomass at low and moderate salinity than those at high salinity. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant activities (AOX) were significantly lower in the emerged condition than those in an inundated condition. Inundation imposed a higher-degree of stress than that of the salinity effect, with prolonged inundation caused sublethal damage (chlorotic leaves). Furthermore, inundation caused the reduction of photosynthetic pigments and fluorescence, dependent on salinity. Extrapolating the ecophysiology of R. stylosa, this species had low tolerance to inundation stress (high ROS and AOX, reduced pigments). Translating this low tolerance to field conditions, in the frequently inundated areas (i.e., seafront mangrove fringes) that are subjected to longer inundation at spring tides, this species may suffer from oxidative stress, stunted growth and consequently low survival."
https://openalex.org/W2885240433,"We investigate how susceptible human drivers are to auditory signals in three situations: when stationary, when driving, or when being driven by an autonomous vehicle. Previous research has shown that human susceptibility is reduced when driving compared to when being stationary. However, it is not known how susceptible humans are under autonomous driving conditions. At the same time, good susceptibility is crucial under autonomous driving conditions, as such systems might use auditory signals to communicate a transition of control from the automated vehicle to the human driver. We measured susceptibility using a three-stimulus auditory oddball paradigm while participants experienced three driving conditions: stationary, autonomous, or driving. We studied susceptibility through the frontal P3 (fP3) Electroencephalography Event-Related Potential response (EEG ERP response). Results show that the fP3 component is reduced in autonomous compared to stationary conditions, but not as strongly as when participants drove themselves. In addition, the fP3 component is further reduced when the oddball task does not require a response (i.e., in a passive condition, versus active). The implication is that, even in a relatively simple autonomous driving scenario, people’s susceptibility of auditory signals is not as high as would be beneficial for responding to auditory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2886156606,"With an estimate of around 9,000 species, the Neotropical region hosts the greatest diversity of freshwater fishes of the world. Genetic surveys have the potential to unravel isolated and unique lineages and may result in the identification of undescribed species, accelerating the cataloguing of extant biodiversity. In this paper, molecular diversity within the valuable and widespread Neotropical genus Hoplias was assessed by means of DNA Barcoding. The geographic coverage spanned 40 degrees of latitude from French Guiana to Argentina. Our analyses revealed 22 mitochondrial lineages fully supported by means of Barcode Index Number, Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery and phylogenetic analyses. This mtDNA survey revealed the existence of 15 fully supported mitochondrial lineages within the once considered to be the continentally distributed H. malabaricus. Only four of them are currently described as valid species however, leaving 11 mitochondrial lineages currently ""masked"" within this species complex. Mean genetic divergence was 13.1%. Barcoding gap analysis discriminated 20 out of the 22 lineages tested. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all taxonomically recognized species form monophyletic groups. Hoplias malabaricus sensu stricto clustered within a large clade, excluding the representatives of the La Plata River Basin. In the H. lacerdae group, all species but H. curupira showed a cohesive match between taxonomic and molecular identification. Two different genetic lineages were recovered for H. aimara. Given the unexpected hidden mitochondrial diversity within H. malabaricus, the COI sequence composition of specimens from Suriname (the type locality), identified as H. malabaricus sensu stricto, is of major importance."
https://openalex.org/W2886461015,"Pore forming proteins such as those belonging to the membrane attack/perforin (MACPF) family have important functions in many organisms. Of the five MACPF proteins found in Plasmodium parasites, three have functions in cell passage and one in host cell egress. Here we report an analysis of the perforin-like protein 4, PPLP4, in the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei. We found that the protein is expressed only in the ookinete, the invasive stage of the parasite formed in the mosquito midgut. Transcriptional analysis revealed that expression of the pplp4 gene commences during ookinete development. The protein was detected in retorts and mature ookinetes. Using two antibodies, the protein was found localized in a dotted pattern, and 3-D SIM super-resolution microcopy revealed the protein in the periphery of the cell. Analysis of a C-terminal mCherry fusion of the protein however showed mainly cytoplasmic label. A pplp4 null mutant formed motile ookinetes, but these were unable to invade and traverse the midgut epithelium resulting in severely impaired oocyst formation and no transmission to naïve mice. However, when in vitro cultured ookinetes were injected into the thorax of the mosquito, thus by-passing midgut passage, sporozoites were formed and the mutant parasites were able to infect naïve mice. Taken together, our data show that PPLP4 is required only for ookinete invasion of the mosquito midgut. Thus PPLP4 has a similar role to the previously studied PPLP3 and PPLP5, raising the question why three proteins with MACPF domains are needed for invasion by the ookinete of the mosquito midgut epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2885944714,"Interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA) is associated with reduced allograft survival, whereas antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) is the major cause for renal allograft failure. To identify specific microRNAs and their regulation involved in these processes, total RNA from blood cells of 16 kidney transplanted (KTx) patients with ABMR, stable graft function (SGF) and with T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR) was isolated. MicroRNA expression was determined by high-throughput sequencing. Differentially expressed candidate microRNAs were analyzed with RT-PCR in patients with SGF (n = 53), urinary tract infection (UTI) (n = 17), borderline rejection (BL) (n = 19), TCMR (n = 40), ABMR (n = 22) and IFTA (n = 30). From the 301 detected microRNAs, 64 were significantly regulated between the three cohorts. Selected candidate microRNAs miR-223-3p, miR-424-3p and miR-145-5p distinguished TCMR and ABMR from SGF, but not from other pathologies. Most importantly, miR-145-5p expression in IFTA patients was significantly downregulated and displayed a high diagnostic accuracy compared to SGF alone (AUC = 0.891) and compared to SGF, UTI, BL, TCMR and ABMR patients combined (AUC = 0.835), which was verified by cross-validation. The identification of miR-145-5p as IFTA specific marker in blood constitutes the basis for evaluating this potentially diagnostic microRNA as biomarker in studies including high numbers of patients and different pathologies and also the further analysis of fibrosis causing etiologies after kidney transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2885226860,"Anaplasma marginale, the causative agent of bovine anaplasmosis, is a tick-borne bacterium that causes significant economic losses for cattle industries and is increasingly being detected in other animal species. Rhipicephalus microplus is the main vector of this bacterium and may be found parasitizing small ruminants. In northeastern Brazil, multispecies grazing is a common family subsistence practice on smallholder farms possibly facilitating interspecies transmission of pathogens. Considering that A. marginale infection has been previously molecularly described in sheep, this study has aimed to estimate the prevalence of A. marginale and factors associated with the infection in goats from northeastern Brazil. A total of 403 goat blood samples were included in the study. An epidemiological questionnaire was applied to each farm owner addressing age, gender, presence of ticks and multispecies grazing. All samples were screened for A. marginale- and A. ovis-infection using primers targeting the Anaplasma spp. msp4 gene. The identity of A. marginale in the blood was confirmed by PCR amplification of msp5 followed by sequencing. Anaplasma spp. were differentiated by sequencing of the repeat region of the msp1α gene. For the statistical analysis the Chi-square or the Fisher's exact test was used to verify association of the individual factors (age, gender, presence of ticks, and multispecies grazing) with Anaplasma spp. infection. We report the first molecular detection of A. marginale in goats from northeastern Brazil, based on msp1α, msp4 and msp5 gene sequencing analysis. Sequencing of the detected A. marginale msp1α gene revealed the F repeat. Amblyomma parvum and R. microplus were found feeding on animals."
https://openalex.org/W2887549196,"Purpose To compare aqueous humour (AH) dynamics in the presence of a precrystalline (Implantable Collamer Lens®; ICL) or iris-fixed (Artiflex®) phakic intraocular lens (PIOL). Methods By computational fluid dynamics simulation, AH flow was modelled through a peripheral iridotomy (PI) or central lens hole (both 360 μm) in the presence of an Artiflex or ICL lens, respectively. The impacts of AH flow were then determined in terms of wall shear stress (WSS) produced on the endothelium or crystalline lens. Effects were also modelled for different scenarios of pupil diameter (PD 3.5 or 5.5 mm), ICL vault (100, 350, 800 μm) and number of Artiflex iridotomies (1 or 2) and location (12 or 6 o’clock). Results For a PD of 3.5 mm, AH volumes flowing from the posterior to the anterior chamber were 37.6% of total flow through the lens hole (ICL) and 84.2% through PI (Artiflex). For an enlarged PD (5.5 mm), corresponding values were 10.3% and 81.9% respectively, so PI constitutes a very efficient way of evacuating AH. Central endothelial WSS in Pa was lower for the large vault ICL and the Artiflex (1−03 and 1.1−03 respectively) compared to the PIOL-free eye (1.6−03). Crystalline lens WSS was highest for the lowest vault ICL (1−04). Conclusions AH flow varied according to the presence of a precrystalline or iris-fixed intraocular lens. Endothelial WSS was lower for an implanted ICL with large vault and Artiflex than in the PIOL-free eye, while highest crystalline WSS was recorded for the lowest vault ICL."
https://openalex.org/W2886086126,"The genomes of the malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites encode a protein fused of 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) domains that catalyze sequential reactions in the folate biosynthetic pathway. Whereas higher organisms derive folate from their diet and lack the enzymes for its synthesis, most eubacteria and a number of lower eukaryotes including malaria parasites synthesize tetrahydrofolate via DHPS. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) HPPK-DHPSs are currently targets of drugs like sulfadoxine (SDX). The SDX effectiveness as an antimalarial drug is increasingly diminished by the rise and spread of drug-resistant mutations. Here, we present the crystal structure of PvHPPK-DHPS in complex with four substrates/analogs, revealing the bifunctional PvHPPK-DHPS architecture in an unprecedented state of enzymatic activation. SDX's effect on HPPK-DHPS is due to 4-amino benzoic acid (pABA) mimicry, and the PvHPPK-DHPS structure sheds light on the SDX-binding cavity, as well as on mutations that effect SDX potency. We mapped five dominant drug resistance mutations in PvHPPK-DHPS: S382A, A383G, K512E/D, A553G, and V585A, most of which occur individually or in clusters proximal to the pABA-binding site. We found that these resistance mutations subtly alter the intricate enzyme/pABA/SDX interactions such that DHPS affinity for pABA is diminished only moderately, but its affinity for SDX is changed substantially. In conclusion, the PvHPPK-DHPS structure rationalizes and unravels the structural bases for SDX resistance mutations and highlights architectural features in HPPK-DHPSs from malaria parasites that can form the basis for developing next-generation anti-folate agents to combat malaria parasites."
https://openalex.org/W2886243927,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe genetic neuromuscular disorder caused by insufficiency of functional survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Several clinical trials have been conducted with the aim of upregulating the expression of the SMN protein in SMA patients. In order to evaluate the efficiency of these SMN-targeted approaches, it has become necessary to verify SMN protein levels in the cells of SMA patients. Accordingly, we have developed a method allowing the evaluation of the functional SMN protein with < 1.5 mL of peripheral blood using imaging flow cytometry. The expression of SMN protein in CD3+, CD19+, and CD33++ cells obtained from SMA patients, was significantly reduced compared with that in cells from control subjects. In spot analysis of CD33++ cells, the intensities of SMN spots were significantly reduced in SMA subjects, when compared with that in controls. Therefore, SMN spots implied the presence of functional SMN protein in the cell nucleus. To our knowledge, our results are the first to demonstrate the presence of functional SMN protein in freshly isolated peripheral blood cells. We anticipate that SMN spot analysis will become the primary endpoint assay for the evaluation and monitoring of therapeutic intervention, with SMN serving as a reliable biomarker of therapeutic efficacy in SMA patients."
https://openalex.org/W2887293086,"In tropical agriculture, the vigorously growing Bracken fern causes severe problems by invading pastures and out-competing the common pasture grasses. Due to infestation by that weed, pastures are abandoned after a few years, and as a fatal consequence, the biodiversity-rich tropical forest is progressively cleared for new grazing areas. Here we present a broad physiological comparison of the two plant species that are the main competitors on the pastures in the tropical Ecuadorian Andes, the planted forage grass Setaria sphacelata and the weed Bracken (Pteridium arachnoideum). With increasing elevation, the competitive power of Bracken increases as shown by satellite data of the study region. Using data obtained from field measurements, the annual biomass production of both plant species, as a measure of their competitive strength, was modeled over an elevational gradient from 1800 to 2800 m. The model shows that with increasing elevation, biomass production of the two species shifts in favor of Bracken which, above 1800 m, is capable of outgrowing the grass. In greenhouse experiments, the effects on plant growth of the presumed key variables of the elevational gradient, temperature and UV radiation, were separately analyzed. Low temperature, as well as UV irradiation, inhibited carbon uptake of the C4-grass more than that of the C3-plant Bracken. The less temperature-sensitive photosynthesis of Bracken and its effective protection from UV radiation contribute to the success of the weed on the highland pastures. In field samples of Bracken but not of Setaria, the content of flavonoids as UV-scavengers increased with the elevation. Combining modeling with measurements in greenhouse and field allowed to explain the invasive growth of a common weed in upland pastures. The performance of Setaria decreases with elevation due to suboptimal photosynthesis at lower temperatures and the inability to adapt its cellular UV screen."

While alterations in mitochondrial function are increasingly recognized in cardiovascular diseases, the molecular mechanisms through which changes in mitochondria lead to heart abnormalities have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that transgenic mice overexpressing a novel regulator of mitochondrial dynamics, transmembrane protein 135 (Tmem135), exhibit increased fragmentation of mitochondria and disease phenotypes in the heart including collagen accumulation and hypertrophy. The gene expression analysis showed that genes associated with ER stress and unfolded protein response, and especially the pathway involving activating transcription factor 4, are upregulated in the heart of Tmem135 transgenic mice. It also showed that gene expression changes in the heart of Tmem135 transgenic mice significantly overlap with those of aged mice in addition to the similarity in cardiac phenotypes, suggesting that changes in mitochondrial dynamics may be involved in the development of heart abnormalities associated with aging. Our study revealed the pathological consequence of overexpression of Tmem135, and suggested downstream molecular changes that may underlie those disease pathologies."

First, Korean emotion lexicons were collected from narratives of residents living in multi-family housing buildings. The lexicons were then classified into four emotion clusters, with three expressing negative emotions (anger, dislike, and pain) and the fourth depicting empathy. Since self-reported annoyance has long been investigated as one of the major non-auditory responses to noise, annoyance was measured along with affective responses in a laboratory experiment with varying noise levels. The findings revealed that the emotion and noise annoyance experienced by the participants were significantly affected by noise levels. All clusters expressing negative emotions showed strong correlations with noise annoyance, whereas that representing empathy showed the weakest correlation. Noise sensitivity and attitudes to the noise source were observed as possible moderators in emotional responses and annoyance ratings."
https://openalex.org/W2773844781,"Since 1997 a considerable effort has been spent on the study of the swap (switch) Markov chains on graphic degree sequences. All of these results assume some kind of regularity in the corresponding degree sequences. Recently, Greenhill and Sfragara published a breakthrough paper about irregular normal and directed degree sequences for which rapid mixing of the swap Markov chain is proved. In this paper we present two groups of results. An example from the first group is the following theorem: let be a directed degree sequence on n vertices. Denote by Δ the maximum value among all in- and out-degrees and denote by the number of edges in the realization. Assume furthermore that . Then the swap Markov chain on the realizations of is rapidly mixing. This result is a slight improvement on one of the results of Greenhill and Sfragara. An example from the second group is the following: let d be a bipartite degree sequence on the vertex set U ⊎ V, and let 0 < c1 ≤ c2 < |U| and 0 < d1 ≤ d2 < |V| be integers, where c1 ≤ d(v) ≤ c2: ∀v ∈ V and d1 ≤ d(u) ≤ d2: ∀u ∈ U. Furthermore assume that (c2 − c1 − 1)(d2 − d1 − 1) < max{c1(|V| − d2), d1(|U| − c2)}. Then the swap Markov chain on the realizations of d is rapidly mixing. A straightforward application of this latter result shows that when a random bipartite or directed graph is generated under the Erdős—Rényi G(n, p) model with mild assumptions on n and p then the degree sequence of the generated graph has, with high probability, a rapidly mixing swap Markov chain on its realizations."
https://openalex.org/W2886925822,"Obesity and adipokines are associated with development of type 2 diabetes. However, limited longitudinal studies have examined their roles on declining β-cell function over time. This report assessed three adiposity measures (BMI, percent body fat, trunk fat), insulin resistance, and fifteen adipokines in relationship to longitudinal change in β-cell function measured by disposition index (DI) from frequently-sampled-intravenous-glucose-tolerance testing. The results showed that three factors were significantly and independently associated with rate of change in DI over time: rate of change in BMI (negative), rate of change in IL-6 (negative), and baseline adiponectin (positive). The association was the strongest for changing BMI and was largely explained by changing insulin resistance; the association with changing IL-6 was also largely explained by changing insulin resistance. Baseline adiponectin remained positively associated after adjustment for changing insulin resistance, suggesting an independent effect of adiponectin to preserve or improve β-cell function. These findings provide evidence and potential mechanisms for the role of obesity in promoting β-cell dysfunction, highlighting the potential importance of mitigating obesity and its metabolic effects in preventing and treating type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2885718028,"Background Making inferences about measles distribution patterns at small area level is vital for more focal targeted intervention. However, in statistical literature, the analysis of originally collected data on one resolution with the purpose to make inferences on a different level of spatial resolution is referred to as the misalignment problem. In Namibia the measles data were available in aggregated format at regional level for the period 2005 to 2014. This leads to a spatial misalignment problem if the purpose is to make decisions at constituency level. Moreover, although data on risk covariates of measles could be obtained at constituency level, they were not available each year between 2005 and 2014. Thus, assuming that covariates were constant through the study period would induce measurement errors which might have effects on the analysis results. This paper presents a spatio-temporal model through a multi-step approach in order to deal with misalignment and measurement error. Methods For the period 2005–2014, measles data from the Ministry of Health and Social Services (MoHSS) were analysed in two steps. First, a multi-step approach was applied to correct spatial misalignment in the data. Second, a classical measurement error model was fitted to account for measurement errors. The time effects were specified using a nonparametric formulation for the linear trend through first order random walk. An interaction between area and time was modelled through type I and type II interaction structures. Results The study showed that there was high variation in measles risk across constituencies and as well as over the study period (2005–2014). Furthermore, the risk of measles was found to be associated with (i) the number of people aged between 0 and 24 years, (ii) the percentages of women aged 15–49 with an educational level more than secondary, (iii) the percentages of children age 12–23 months who received measles vaccine, (iv) the percentages of malnourished children under 5 years, and (vi) the measles cases for each previous year. Conclusion The study showed some of the determinants of measles risk and revealed areas at high risk through disease mapping. Additionally, the study showed a non-linear temporal distribution of measles risk over the study period. Finally, it was shown that ignoring the measurement errors may yield misleading results. It was recommended that group and geographically targeted intervention, prevention and control strategies can be tailored on the basis these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2885653341,"This study aimed to investigate (a) motor planning difficulty by using a two-step test in Parkinson's disease (PD) compared with age-matched healthy subjects and (b) the relationship between motor planning difficulty and clinical factors. The two-step test was performed by 58 patients with PD with Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage I-IV and 110 age-matched healthy older adult controls. In the two-step test, the participants estimated the two-step distance with maximum effort. Subsequently, they performed the actual two-step trial to measure the actual maximum distance. We calculated the accuracy of the estimation (estimated distance minus actual distance). In both groups, subjects who estimated >5 cm were defined as the overestimation group, and those who estimated <5 cm over- and underestimation were defined as the non-overestimation group. The overestimation group consisted of 17 healthy older adults (15.5%) and 23 patients with PD (39.7%). The number of patients with PD with overestimation was significantly more than that of healthy controls by Chi-squared test. H&Y stage and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part II and III scores in overestimation group in PD patients were significantly higher than those in overestimation group in PD patients. Moreover, multiple regression using H&Y stage and UPDRS parts II and III as independent variables showed that the UPDRS part II score was the only related factor for the estimation error distance. Estimation error distance was significant correlated with UPDRS parts II and III. Patients with PD easily have higher rates of motor-related overestimation than age-matched healthy controls. In addition, UPDRS parts II and III expressed ability of activities of daily living and motor function as influences on motor-related overestimation. Particularly, multiple regression indicated that UPDRS part II directly showed the ability of daily living as an essential factor for overestimation."
https://openalex.org/W2886742553,"European managed grasslands are amongst the most productive in the world. Besides temperature and the amount and timing of precipitation, grass production is also highly controlled by applications of nitrogen fertilizers and land management to sustain a high productivity. Since management characteristics of pastures vary greatly across Europe, land-use intensity and their projections are critical input variables in earth system modeling when examining and predicting the effects of increasingly intensified agricultural and livestock systems on the environment. In this study, we aim to improve the representation of pastures in the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. This is done by incorporating daily carbon allocation for grasses as a foundation to further implement daily land management routines and land-use intensity data into the model to discriminate between intensively and extensively used regions. We further compare our new simulations with leaf area index observations, reported regional grassland productivity, and simulations conducted with the vegetation model ORCHIDEE-GM. Additionally, we analyze the implications of including pasture fertilization and daily management compared to the standard version of LPJ-GUESS. Our results demonstrate that grassland productivity cannot be adequately captured without including land-use intensity data in form of nitrogen applications. Using this type of information improved spatial patterns of grassland productivity significantly compared to standard LPJ-GUESS. In general, simulations for net primary productivity, net ecosystem carbon balance and nitrogen leaching were considerably increased in the extended version. Finally, the adapted version of LPJ-GUESS, driven with projections of climate and land-use intensity, simulated an increase in potential grassland productivity until 2050 for several agro-climatic regions, most notably for the Mediterranean North, the Mediterranean South, the Atlantic Central and the Atlantic South."

Following audiological and somatic tinnitus evaluation, patients were divided into two groups. The study group (n = 134) included subjects that met both the following criteria: A) a self-reported history for TMJ dysfunction and B) a positive modulation of tinnitus following somatic maneuvers in the TMJ region. The control group (n = 92) included patients with similar demographic and tinnitus characteristics that did not meet the proposed criteria for somatic tinnitus. Afterwards, patients underwent clinical TMJ evaluation in the Service of Clinical Gnathology of our University.One hundred thirty-one patients (57.9%) received a clinical diagnosis of TMJ disorder according to DC/TMD Axis I; 79.1% in the study group and 27.2% in the control group. Ninety-five (42.1%) patients were negative for TMJ disorders; 20.9% in the study group and 72.8% in the control group. A significantly higher number of TMJ disorders was found in patients in the study group compared to the control group (p<0.0001). Most patients had joint disorders (67.2%), followed by other (29.8%) and pain disorders (29%). Logistic regression analysis in the study group showed that female gender was more prevalent in patients with TMJ disorders.Our findings in patients with chronic tinnitus and normal hearing suggest that self-reported history for somatic dysfunction and modulation of tinnitus, when occurring simultaneously in the TMJ region, can be useful to preliminarily identify patients with TMJ disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2887390889,"To investigate the role of intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in comparison with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).An in-silico planning study was performed on 20 patients. The prescription dose was 60Gy in 6 fractions. Patients were planned with abdominal compression. IMPT plans were optimized with or without the inclusion of CT calibration (3%) and isocenter positioning (2,4,6mm) uncertainties. Plan robustness was appraised comparing rubust optimized plans vs standard plans and also in terms of the worst-case scenario. VMAT plans were optimized for 10FFF photon beams using 2 partial arcs.Target coverage was fully achieved by both VMAT and IMPT plans with a significant improvement in homogeneity (~25%) with IMPT. Integral dose was reduced of ~60% with IMPT while the conformality of the dose distributions was similar among techniques. The sparing of the organs at risk was strongly improved with IMPT although all clinical objectives were met for both techniques. The inclusion of the uncertainties in the optimization lead to some deterioration in the target dose homogeneity (from 40 to 80% worse with 4 or 6mm position uncertainty) while none of the coverage parameters or OAR objective was violated. The worst-case scenario analysis demonstrated the risk of a major target underdosage only in the case of the most extreme errors (6mm) with D98% in average ~12% lower than the threshold.IMPT with the support of abdominal compression, can be considered a viable solution also for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Great care shall be put in the minimization of the residual respiration and positioning uncertainties but the dosimetric advantage for organs at risk and the relative robustness on target coverage are promising factors."
https://openalex.org/W2886405001,"Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) activates the actin-related protein 2/3 homolog (Arp2/3) complex and regulates actin polymerization in a physiological setting. Cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) is a key activator of WASP, which binds Cdc42 through a Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding (CRIB)-containing region that defines a subset of Cdc42 effectors. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis and binding affinity determination and kinetic assays, we report the results of an investigation into the energetic contributions of individual WASP residues to both the Cdc42–WASP binding interface and the kinetics of complex formation. Our results support the previously proposed dock-and-coalesce binding mechanism, initiated by electrostatic steering driven by WASP's basic region and followed by a coalescence phase likely driven by the conserved CRIB motif. The WASP basic region, however, appears also to play a role in the final complex, as its mutation affected both on- and off-rates, suggesting a more comprehensive physiological role for this region centered on the C-terminal triad of positive residues. These results highlight the expanding roles of the basic region in WASP and other CRIB-containing effector proteins in regulating complex cellular processes and coordinating multiple input signals. The data presented improve our understanding of the Cdc42–WASP interface and also add to the body of information available for Cdc42–effector complex formation, therapeutic targeting of which has promise for Ras-driven cancers. Our findings suggest that combining high-affinity peptide-binding sequences with short electrostatic steering sequences could increase the efficacy of peptidomimetic candidates designed to interfere with Cdc42 signaling in cancer. Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) activates the actin-related protein 2/3 homolog (Arp2/3) complex and regulates actin polymerization in a physiological setting. Cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) is a key activator of WASP, which binds Cdc42 through a Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding (CRIB)-containing region that defines a subset of Cdc42 effectors. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis and binding affinity determination and kinetic assays, we report the results of an investigation into the energetic contributions of individual WASP residues to both the Cdc42–WASP binding interface and the kinetics of complex formation. Our results support the previously proposed dock-and-coalesce binding mechanism, initiated by electrostatic steering driven by WASP's basic region and followed by a coalescence phase likely driven by the conserved CRIB motif. The WASP basic region, however, appears also to play a role in the final complex, as its mutation affected both on- and off-rates, suggesting a more comprehensive physiological role for this region centered on the C-terminal triad of positive residues. These results highlight the expanding roles of the basic region in WASP and other CRIB-containing effector proteins in regulating complex cellular processes and coordinating multiple input signals. The data presented improve our understanding of the Cdc42–WASP interface and also add to the body of information available for Cdc42–effector complex formation, therapeutic targeting of which has promise for Ras-driven cancers. Our findings suggest that combining high-affinity peptide-binding sequences with short electrostatic steering sequences could increase the efficacy of peptidomimetic candidates designed to interfere with Cdc42 signaling in cancer."

However, the overall relationships among patient engagement measures and health outcomes remain unclear. This study aims to integrate expert knowledge and survey data for the identification of measures that have extensive associations with other variables and can be prioritized to engage patients. Methods We used the 2014 International Health Policy Survey (IHPS), which provided information on elder adults in 11 countries with details in patient characteristics, healthcare experiences, and patient-physician communication. Patient engagement or support was measured with eight variables including patients’ treatment choices, involvement, and treatment priority setting. Three types of care were identified: primary, specialist and chronic illness care. Specialists were doctors specializing in one area of health care. Chronic illness included eight chronic conditions surveyed. Expert knowledge was used to assist variable selection. We used Bayesian network models consisting of nodes that represented variables of interest and arcs that represented their relationships. Results Among 25,530 participants, the mean age was 68.51 years and 57.40% were females. The distributions of age, sex, education, and patient engagement were significantly different across countries. For chronic illness care, written plans provided by professionals were linked to treatment feasibility and helpfulness. Whether professionals contacted patients was associated with the availability of professionals they could reach for chronic illness care. For specialist care, if specialists provided treatment choices, patients were more likely to be involved and discuss about what mattered to them. Conclusion The strategies to engage patients may depend on the types of care, specialist or chronic illness care. For the study on the observational IHPS data, network modeling is useful to integrate expert knowledge. We suggest considering other theory-based patient engagement in major surveys, as well as engaging patients in their healthcare by providing written plans and actively communicating with patients for chronic illnesses, and encouraging specialists to discuss and provide treatment options."
https://openalex.org/W2885955518,"Sweet potato is a vegetatively propagated crop that is produced for both growth in Korean fields and for export out of the country. The viruses that are present in introduced sweet potatoes can spread both domestically and to foreign countries. Determining the time and path of virus movement could help curtail its spread and prevent future dispersal of related viruses. Determining the consequences of past virus and sweet potato dispersal could provide insight into the ecological and economic risks associated with other sweet potato-infecting viral invasions. We therefore applied Bayesian phylogeographic inferences and recombination analyses of the available Sweepovirus sequences (including 25 Korean Sweepovirus genomes) and reconstructed a plausible history of Sweepovirus diversification and movement across the globe. The Mediterranean basin and Central America were found to be the launchpad of global Sweepovirus dispersal. Currently, China and Brazil are acting as convergence regions for Sweepoviruses. Recently reported Korean Sweepovirus isolates were introduced from China in a recent phase and the regions around China and Brazil continue to act as centers of Sweepovirus diversity and sites of ongoing Sweepovirus evolution. The evidence indicates that the region is an epidemiological hotspot, which suggests that novel Sweepovirus variants might be found."
https://openalex.org/W2886566140,"Background Physical fitness of patients with a lower limb amputation predicts their walking ability and may be improved by physical exercise and training. A maximal exercise test is recommended prior to training in order to determine cardiovascular risks and design exercise programs. A potentially suitable ergometer for maximal exercise testing in patients with a lower limb amputation is the combined arm-leg (Cruiser) ergometer. The aim of this study was to determine feasibility, safety, and reliability of (sub)maximal exercise testing on the Cruiser ergometer in subjects with a lower limb amputation. Methods and findings Subjects with a lower limb amputation performed 1 submaximal exercise test and 3 maximal exercise tests on the Cruiser ergometer. Feasibility was determined by examining whether key variables such as power output, heart rate and oxygen uptake were correctly and reliably measured, by determining whether a test was a maximal aerobic performance, by studying reasons for non-completion, and by measuring gross efficiency. Safety was analyzed by recording complications, electrocardiogram results, and blood pressure. Reliability was tested by comparing the results of the second and third maximal exercise test. Seventeen subjects (14 men and 3 women) out of 21 preselected subjects completed the study. In general, the maximal Cruiser exercise test was feasible. Almost 75% of the subjects reached a maximal aerobic performance. The test was also safe because no complications occurred, although electrocardiogram and blood pressure could only be reliably recorded in most subjects just before and after the test. Reliability was good: Intraclass correlation was 0.84 for peak oxygen uptake. Conclusions The Cruiser ergometer is a feasible, safe, and reliable ergometer for measuring physical fitness of subjects with a lower limb amputation."
