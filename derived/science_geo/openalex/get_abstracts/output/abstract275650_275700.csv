https://openalex.org/W1983394039,"Montmorillonitic and kaolinitic clays are effective in decreasing the toxicity of paraquat, an organic cation, to cucumber plants. The cation was adsorbed on the surface of the kaolinite clay particles and slowly became available to the plants. When it was adsorbed in the interlayer spacings of the montmorillonite clay, however, it was not available to the plants."

https://openalex.org/W2085246376,"The dehydroxylation reaction of kaolinite in a vacuum at 425 degrees C is halted by introducing a water vapor pressure of 47 mm-Hg, and is resumed when the vacuum is reestablished. The sample gains weight corresponding to an approximately monomotecular layer of water on the kaolinite surface. At the temperatures and vapor pressures involved, the sorption is considered to be a chemisorption process."

https://openalex.org/W2038172870,"The maximum quantum yield of oxygen evolution in deuterated chlorella is found to be 0.075, while normal chlorella showed, in parallel experiments, a value of 0.10. Deuterated Chlorella vulgaris showed a decline in the quantum yield of oxygen evolution (""red drop"") beginning at 680 millimicrons and a clear Emerson enhancement effect qualitatively similar to that obtained in normal chlorella cells. However, the ratio of quantumn yield at 680 to that at 710 millimicrons was about 1.5 times higher in normal than in deuterated chlorella cells. Action spectra of the Emerson enhancement effect in deuterated chlorella also are qualitatively similar to those of normal cells."

https://openalex.org/W1989250200,"The calcium carbonate in freshwater clam shells is simlilar in purity to that designated reagent grade. A simple reprecipitation of the shell extract results in a product having less Sr and Mg than reagent grade CaCO(3). Clams are harvested commercially, and discarded shells are a high-quality raw material for the production of CaCO(3)."
