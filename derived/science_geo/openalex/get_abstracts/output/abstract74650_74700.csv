https://openalex.org/W1970365262,"The maize mutant shrunken-2 synthesizes only 25 to 30 percent as much starch as normal maize; it completely lacks adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase activity in both endosperm and embryo tissue. Identification of the mutant block indicates that the greater portion of starch in the endosperm of normal maize is synthesized by way of enzyme systems that utilize adenosine diphosphate glucose as a substrate, and that the latter is formed chiefly by adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase."

https://openalex.org/W1497635662,"This paper deals with the facilitated diffusion of oxygen in systems containing proteins, such as ferrohemoglobin, that combine reversibly with oxygen. The phenomenon is treated in terms of translational diffusion of free and bound oxygen molecules, and of the reaction rate of the oxygen molecules with the oxygen-binding protein. These considerations lead to a differential equation (see Equation 9) for the flux; analytical or numerical solutions for this equation are not yet available. However, the assumption that chemical equilibrium exists at every point in the diffusing system leads to a simple equation already derived by other workers. This in turn permits calculation of the partial pressure of oxygen as a function of distance, in facilitated diffusion across a flat membrane, for given values of the total oxygen flux. The data given by Wittenberg in the preceding paper are analyzed in these terms, with satisfactory agreement between experiment and calculation. The possible contribution of rotary diffusion to the facilitated flux of oxygen is analyzed in detail, and it is found to be negligible compared to that of translational diffusion. Calculations of facilitated diffusion in muscle resulting from the presence of myoglobin indicate that myoglobin may be responsible for a substantial part of the transport of oxygen in muscle, especially at low partial pressures of oxygen."

https://openalex.org/W1589066222,"Abstract Extensive purification of the enzyme system from Peptococcus glycinophilus catalyzing the labilization of the glycine carboxyl group has been accomplished, and some reaction properties of the purified system have been defined. Two protein fractions essential for the exchange of the glycine carboxyl group with bicarbonate were isolated. Each of the proteins was totally inactive by itself in catalyzing the exchange, but combination of the two fractions resulted in high activity. One of the proteins, purified 60-fold, was shown to be a pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzyme and was destroyed by boiling. The other protein, purified 230-fold, was colorless and stable to boiling in 5% ammonium sulfate. Maximal CO2 exchange activity was observed at pH 7.0, required the addition of 10-2 m sulfhydryl groups, and proceeded more rapidly in the presence of 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate than in its absence. The reaction was inhibited by formaldehyde, glyoxylate, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and mercury and copper ions; but it was neither inhibited by avidin nor stimulated by biotin or numerous divalent metals. Glyoxylate and glycolate failed to react in the system which allowed the exchange of bicarbonate with the carboxyl group of glycine."
https://openalex.org/W1482468374,"Abstract The reactive sulfhydryl groups of human oxyhemoglobin (at position 93 of the β chains) form compounds with cystine, cystamine, dimercaptoethanol, and iodoacetamide. No reaction occurs with dithioglycolic acid, dithiobutyric acid, or diformylcystine. Some reaction occurs with iodoacetic acid but only under special conditions. The general properties (stability, spectra, molecular weight) of the modified hemoglobins described in this paper (except perhaps for the hemoglobin treated with iodoacetic acid) are very similar to those of unreacted hemoglobin. The oxygen equilibrium of these compounds has been studied. In all cases, the value of n is similar to that of normal hemoglobin (namely about 2.9) and is approximately invariant with pH. The oxygen Bohr effect is substantially reduced, and the pattern of all the results is similar in spite of the different chemical structures of the blocking reagents. The hemoglobin treated with cystine shows differential binding of the HPO4=ion as between the oxy and deoxy forms at concentrations of HPO4= in the neighborhood of 0.3 m. This explains the discrepancy between the directly measured Bohr effect for this compound and for hemoglobin treated with cystamine and that calculated from differential titrations. On the other hand, in the case of hemoglobin treated with iodoacetamide, where the newly introduced group carries no charge, there is good agreement between the Bohr effect measured by the two methods. The kinetics of combination of deoxyhemoglobins with carbon monoxide and of the dissociation of O2 from oxyhemoglobins has been studied. The kinetic behavior of all the compounds described in the present work is qualitatively similar to that of normal hemoglobin, but different from that of hemoglobin treated with p-mercuribenzoate."
https://openalex.org/W1532158716,"Abstract The visible absorption spectra and optical rotatory dispersion spectra of l-histidine-containing peptides and copper(II) have been investigated. A knowledge of the equilibrium constants involved has enabled the spectra to be resolved into contributions from individual species. With the particular choice of peptides it has been possible to assess the contribution of different bonded groups to the magnitude of the ligand field around the central copper(II), which is reflected in the λmax values. The order of relative effectiveness is found to be: α-amino nitrogen g peptide nitrogen g imidazole nitrogen. Decisions can thus be made among alternative structures by measurement of the absorption spectra. The optical rotatory spectra show that the anomalous dispersion around the absorption band in the visible region is the resultant of two overlapping Cotton effects. When the l-histidyl residue is carboxyl terminal, these Cotton effects are of opposite sign. In the one example in which the l-histidyl residue was penultimate from the carboxyl terminus, both Cotton effects appeared to be negative. An explanation for the Cotton effects in the visible region has been given, postulating that interaction between the carbonyl oxygen of the l-histidyl carboxyl group and the copper(II) is responsible for predominance of one of the possible configurations of ligands around the metal ion."

A liquid-water phase persists in the tissue down to about -70 degrees C; the extent of the phase decreases rapidly between 0 degrees and -10 degrees C and slowly at lower temperatures. That the NMR absorption peak of the liquid water increases in width, with decreasing temperature, suggests loss of mobility or structuring of the phase. A technique for introducing geometrically uniform cores of muscle into the probe of the high-resolution spectrometer permits quantitative determinations of liquid water."

https://openalex.org/W1490254596,"1. Commercially available coenzyme A preparations were found to contain sufficient amounts of glutathione so that in the reaction with diketene significant quanties of acetoacetyl glutathione were formed. Unless allowances are made for this, significant errors in the interpretation of results can be made because liver mitochondria contain a very active acetoacetyl glutathione hydrolase. 2. Purified acetoacetyl coenzyme A was not deacylated by solubilized mitochondrial preparations under conditions of this assay. Since no acetoacetate was synthesized when β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthesis was inhibited, it was concluded that in the guinea pig liver acetoacetate formation proceeds entirely through β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl coenzyme A. 3. The results indicated that during ketosis, significant quantities of acetoacetate may be synthesized by an extramitochondrial pathway. On the basis of experimental evidence, it was considered unlikely that the enzymes were eluted from mitochondria during the isolation procedure. 4. Acetoacetate synthesis was strongly inhibited by free coenzyme A. This inhibition could not be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetyl coenzyme A several-fold. On this basis, the suggestion was made that the degree of ketosis in the intact animal may relate closely to the levels of free coenzyme A in the liver and that the concentration of acetyl coenzyme A may be of lesser importance."
https://openalex.org/W1554319087,"Abstract Functional properties of hemoglobin Miwate (α287 tyrβ2a) were studied with particular reference to their relations with the structure of this abnormal hemoglobin. 1. The oxygen affinity of hemoglobin Miwate (in reality the β subunits) was far lower than that of hemoglobin A, and the interaction constant n in oxygen equilibrium was 1.0 at any pH. Apparently no Bohr effect was observed in the pH range 6.3 to 7.5, while a very small Bohr effect (Δlog p½/ΔpH = 0.19) could be observed at higher pH values. A lowered Bohr effect was confirmed by the differential titration experiments. 2. Hemoglobin Miwate, like hemoglobin A, dissociates into αβ dimers at higher concentrations of sodium chloride, but the features of the oxygen equilibrium of the half-molecules of hemoglobin Miwate were not appreciably different from those of the original molecule. 3. Hemoglobin Miwate has two reactive groups per molecule. However, —SH blocking by p-chloromercuribenzoate resulted in no particular change in the value of n and in oxygen affinity, except that the Bohr effect at higher pH values appeared to be lost. 4. Characteristics of the carbon monoxide equilibrium of hemoglobin Miwate were similar to those observed in oxygen equilibrium. However, when the α subunits were reduced by sodium dithionite, and hence enabled to bind carbon monoxide, the carbon monoxide affinity and the Bohr effect were increased to nearly the same levels as observed with hemoglobin A. Nevertheless, the value of n remained nearly at 1.0. 5. Rates of autoxidation of hemoglobin Miwate were about 6 times higher than those of hemoglobin A under comparable conditions. 6. The α subunits of hemoglobin Miwate were more resistant to denaturation by sodium benzoate than the normal hemoglobin. These data strongly suggest that the substitution of only a single amino acid in one type of subunits profoundly affects the functional properties not only of the abnormal subunits, but also of structurally normal subunits in the same molecule, and possibly of the molecule as a whole. Also it was suggested, because of these and some other findings, that the conformational changes of the hemoglobin molecule responsible for the Bohr effect, the affinity for ligands, and the shape of the oxygen or carbon monoxide dissociation curve, respectively, may be different, even if closely related."
https://openalex.org/W2058206901,New details of mitotic spindle structures in the endosperm of Haemanthus katherinae (Bak) have been demonstrated by differential interference microscopy. Spindle fibers are clearly seen in the living spindle extending from the kinetochores to the polar region. Individual spindle fibers consist of a bundle of smaller filaments which diverge slightly from the kinetochore and intermingle with filaments from other spindle fibers as they approach the polar region. The degree of intermingling increases during metaphase and anaphase. The chromosomes stop moving when the spindle fibers are still 5 to 10microns long; then the fibers disappear. These observations explain some aspects of spindle movements which were difficult to reconcile with earlier concepts of spindle organization.
https://openalex.org/W1553927618,"Abstract Kinetic and optical properties of the pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzyme and the heat-stable, low molecular weight protein required for the exchange of bicarbonate with the glycine carboxyl group have been described. Saturation curves were determined for glycine, bicarbonate, pyridoxal phosphate, and the heat-stable protein P2; and Michaelis constants of 0.032 m, 0.031 m, 4.6 µm, and 1.3 mg per ml, respectively, were obtained. Treatment of the enzyme with cysteine removed the coenzyme and resulted in greatly decreased activity, but the activity was fully restored by incubation of the apoenzyme with pyridoxal phosphate. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum of the holoenzyme showed a maximum at 430 mµ which was reduced 85% by treatment with cysteine, but which was restored by incubation with pyridoxal phosphate. Fluorescence maxima at 390 and 500 mµ were observed when the holoenzyme was subjected to activating light at 330 and 430 mµ, respectively. The 500 mµ peak was associated with the azomethine linkage between the coenzyme and the enzyme since it was decreased by removal of pyridoxal phosphate, but the 390 mµ peak appeared to be associated only with the protein since it was not significantly altered by the above treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1506240441,"Abstract The action of bull seminal plasma 5'-nucleotidase on adenosine 5'-phosphate in the presence of magnesium has one optimum at pH 7.5 to 8.0 and a second at pH 9.1 to 9.3. Only one optimum, at pH 7.5 to 8.0, occurs in the absence of magnesium. The phenomenon of a double pH optimum was independent of the nature of the buffer that was employed. A magnesium concentration of 0.005 to 0.01 m and a temperature of at least 25° were necessary for the appearance of the second pH optimum. The apparent energy of activation in the absence or presence of magnesium was dependent on pH. Maximal values of 10,300 cal per mole at pH 7.5 to 8.0 and 15,400 cal per mole at pH 9.2 were obtained in the absence and presence of magnesium, respectively. All nine nucleotides that were investigated in the absence of magnesium showed only one pH optimum at approximately 7.5 to 8.0. In the presence of magnesium, all nucleotides manifested an optimum at pH 9.0 to 9.3; of these the 5'-phosphates of adenosine, guanosine, and inosine also showed a pH optimum at approximately 7.5. The apparent Km values for deoxyribonucleotides were in general much larger than those for the corresponding ribonucleotides. In the absence of Mg++, the apparent pKm values for the action of 5'-nucleotidase on adenosine 5'-phosphate were constant, within experimental variation, from pH 7.0 to pH 8.7, and thereafter decreased with a slope of -1. In the presence of Mg++ the apparent pKm values were constant until a pH of approximately 9.5 and thereafter decreased with the same slope. A formulation is proposed for the phenomenon of the double pH optimum in the action of 5'-nucleotidase, and for the influence of Mg++ on this effect. Four sites are postulated to be involved in the interaction of the enzyme and the substrate; the role of each of these sites is discussed."

Acetone-dried powder from whole rat liver retained all of its retinol palmitate-hydrolyzing activity. Ammonium sulfate fractionation of the acetone-dried powder yielded a partially purified enzyme liberating 240 mµmoles of retinol per mg of protein per 60 min when retinol palmitate was used as substrate. The pH optimum was 8.6 and Km was 1.6 x 10-4 m. The enzyme was inhibited by ethanol, acetone, and Tween 80 and activated by bile salts. The activity of the enzyme was greatest for retinol palmitate, 60% lower for retinol acetate, and 70 to 90% lower for retinol oleate, linoleate, linolenate, stearate, myristate, and laurate. The liver enzyme efficiently hydrolyzed the retinol ester stored in the liver."

https://openalex.org/W1586011701,"1. Prior treatment of rats with certain steroid hormones affects the binding of calcium to subsequently isolated liver mitochondria in vitro. Mitochondria isolated from animals treated with cortisol bind less calcium than do mitochondria from control animals under conditions in which binding is supported either by adenosine triphosphate alone or primarily by a respiratory substrate. Treatment with other glucocorticoids (prednisone and cortisone) likewise diminishes substrate-dependent calcium binding to mitochondria in vitro. 2. Prior treatment with deoxycorticosterone enhances the binding of calcium to subsequently isolated mitochondria in both ATP- and substrate-dependent systems. Treatment with aldosterone and 17β-estradiol also increases calcium binding under respiratory substrate-dependent conditions in vitro. Treatment with testosterone or progesterone is ineffective in altering mitochondrial calcium binding in vitro. 3. The results suggest that treatment of rats with cortisol or deoxycorticosterone affects the ATPase activity of subsequently isolated mitochondria and that this effect may be responsible for alterations in the ATP-dependent binding of calcium in vitro. The effect of cortisol treatment on diminishing ATP-dependent calcium binding is potentiated by the addition of oligomycin in vitro. 4. Antimycin inhibits the substrate-dependent binding of calcium to mitochondria in vitro. This effect is potentiated by cortisol treatment of the animal, probably by virtue of a steroid-induced block in the electron transport sequence at or near the antimycin-sensitive step. 5. It is suggested that cortisol treatment interferes with the utilization of ATP or respiratory substrate necessary to support mitochondrial calcium binding in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W2090886887,"The perivacuolar cytoplasm of Noctiluca miliaris contains approximately 10(4) microsources of luminescence, with dimensions of 0.5 to 1.5 microns, which exhibit marked fluorescence with ultraviolet excitation. Local invasion by an action potential elicits light emission (microflashes) from these sources with a coupling latency of about 2 milliseconds. Magnitudes of the microflash vary directly with the dimensions of the source. Time courses of the microflash resemble that of the macroflash emitted by the whole cell but have somewhat shorter time constants. The small discrepancy induration between micro- and macroflash can be explained by the 5- to 10-millisecond asynchrony of microsource triggering that results from the conduction time of the action potential. Reversible gradations in amplitude of the macroflash, as from potentiation or fatigue, result from parallel summation of graded changes in microflash intensity. Thus the macroflash gives a reasonably true picture of the subcellular kinetics of luminescence."
https://openalex.org/W2466448521,"Abstract Testosterone glucuronide (unlabeled and labeled) was synthesized and injected into three normal men, one pregnant woman, and one child. In addition to testosterone glucuronide itself, several urinary metabolites were isolated. Only 5β-androstane steroids were obtained. More 5β-androstane-3α,17β-diol than 5β-androsterone was found. Meanwhile, a testosterone tracer gave 5α-metabolites, and more 5β-androsterone than 5β-androstan-3α,17β-diol. These findings provide evidence for a further metabolism of testosterone glucuronide through a selective 5β-metabolism. A direct metabolism of the conjugate giving 5β-metabolites could be postulated; a metabolic cleavage of testosterone glucuronide seems unlikely, unless it occurred in an undefined organ in which testosterone does not give 5α-compounds. In any case, the glucuronic acid moiety greatly changes the metabolism of testosterone. Calculations made from the specific activity of urinary testosterone after injection of radioactive testosterone and testosterone glucuronide show a production of approximately 5% of testosterone glucuronide from testosterone in the body. During these studies, the structure of urinary testosterone glucuronide has been observed to be mostly 17β-yl-β-d-glucopyranuronoside, less than 10% (if any) of urinary testosterone glucuronide being possibly 3-enol or diglucuronide or both."

The inhibitor 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine inhibits the utilization of xanthine for guanosine triphosphate formation in rabbit erythrocytes, but does not affect its utilization for the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate. Similarly, the inhibitor interferes with the utilization of xanthine for guanosine triphosphate formation in human erythrocytes, without affecting its utilization for the synthesis of inosine monophosphate."

An essentially inverse relationship obtained between the glucose-6-phosphate-independent fraction of the enzyme and the cellular concentration of glycogen. Some exceptions noted to this general case may have been due to unequal rates of glycogenolysis during the detachment of growing cells. 3. Insulin lowered the glucose 6-phosphate dependence of the enzyme and counteracted the effects observed with hexose. However, the locus of insulin action was distinct from that of hexose or glycogen. Insulin permitted a higher independence of the enzyme at a given glycogen concentration. 4. The control of phosphorylase kinase and of glycogen synthetase by hexose is interpreted as a negative feedback system, which prevents the overaccumulation of glycogen when substrate is abundant and the depletion of limited glycogen reserves when substrate is deficient. The unique suitability of the effectors glucose 6-phosphate and 5'-adenylate is discussed."

Nippostrongylus larvae are less sensitive than those of Haemonchus and require very high light intensities before a significant effect can be detected."
https://openalex.org/W2023356493,"Chromosomes were analyzed from a population of Spermophilus beldingi that included an adult female and three juveniles from the same burrow. All animals had a diploid number of 30. The adult and a juvenile female from the burrow had identical aberrant karyotypes containing an unpaired submetacentric and a minute metacentric chromosome. A familial aberration involving an X chromosome, without phenotypic alteration, is most probable."

These radioactive isotopes are believed to be from natural sources, but their resulting annual dosage of thyroid radiation has exceeded that from iodine-131 fallout."

Any splitting of a resultant trace for the change of protein mobility with (p)H suggests both protein heterogeneity and the (p)H conditions under which further purification and subfractionation may best be pursued."
