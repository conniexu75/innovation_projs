https://openalex.org/W2122984483,"Transgenerational effects have wide-ranging implications for human health, biological adaptation, and evolution; however, their mechanisms and biology remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that a germline nuclear small RNA/chromatin pathway can maintain stable inheritance for many generations when triggered by a piRNA-dependent foreign RNA response in C. elegans. Using forward genetic screens and candidate approaches, we find that a core set of nuclear RNAi and chromatin factors is required for multigenerational inheritance of environmental RNAi and piRNA silencing. These include a germline-specific nuclear Argonaute HRDE1/WAGO-9, a HP1 ortholog HPL-2, and two putative histone methyltransferases, SET-25 and SET-32. piRNAs can trigger highly stable long-term silencing lasting at least 20 generations. Once established, this long-term memory becomes independent of the piRNA trigger but remains dependent on the nuclear RNAi/chromatin pathway. Our data present a multigenerational epigenetic inheritance mechanism induced by piRNAs.

Multigenerational inheritance and piRNAs converge on same nuclear silencing pathway HRDE1/WAGO-9 and chromatin factors required for inheritance of piRNA silencing piRNAs can induce multigenerational silencing for more than 20 generations. Long-term memory independent of piRNA triggers but remains dependent on nuclear pathway Since August Weismann (1834–1914) formulated the distinction between innate and acquired characteristics at the end of the 19th century, the debate relating to the inheritance of acquired traits has raised many controversies in the scientific community (Weismann, 1891Weismann A. Essays on heredity. Clarendon Press, Oxford1891Google Scholar, Bateson, 1919Bateson W.

Epigenetics and the Lamarckian temptation.Biol. Philos. 2006; 22: 415-428Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). August Weismann himself theoretically rejected this type of hereditability, arguing that, even though environmental stimuli could provoke adaptive responses in the somatic lineage, no evidence suggested that these changes could be communicated to the germline (Weismann, 1891Weismann A. Essays on heredity. Clarendon Press, Oxford1891Google Scholar). However, a number of epigenetic phenomena involving RNA, histone modification, or DNA methylation in many organisms have renewed interest in this area (Varmuza, 2003Varmuza S.

In this phenomenon, a silenced allele can act in trans on a homologous sequence to cause stable and heritable silencing. This newly silenced allele can now itself act in a paramutagenic fashion to silence other alleles. Paramutation has been described in multiple species, and it seems likely that small RNAs play a key role in the process, although the full mechanisms involved still remain unclear (Stam and Mittelsten Scheid, 2005Stam M.

C. elegans has emerged as a key model for the analysis of several related pathways that regulate genes via small RNAs. C. elegans is well suited to the analysis of multigenerational effects, due to its short generation time (∼3 days) and the ease with which they can be maintained under tightly controlled experimental conditions. In eukaryotes, 20–30 nucleotide (nt) RNAs bound to Argonaute (AGO) protein cofactors are the effectors of a number of gene regulation pathways (Carmell et al., 2002Carmell M.A. Xuan Z. Zhang M.Q. Hannon G.J. The Argonaute family: tentacles that reach into RNAi, developmental control, stem cell maintenance, and tumorigenesis.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2733-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The discovery of the process of RNA interference (RNAi) has been a major milestone (Fire et al., 1998Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Potent and specific genetic interference by double-stranded RNA in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11739) Google Scholar). While 21–22 nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are the small RNA effectors of RNAi, RNAi can be induced by injection of long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or by providing dsRNA environmentally in the food of C. elegans (Timmons et al., 2001Timmons L. Court D.L. Fire A. Ingestion of bacterially expressed dsRNAs can produce specific and potent genetic interference in Caenorhabditis elegans.Gene. 2001; 263: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). In both instances, dsRNA is processed by the RNase Dicer to give rise to primary siRNAs. RNAi effects are generally systemic (soma and germline) and are observed in the F1 generation, but the latter requires the generation of secondary siRNAs (Grishok et al., 2000Grishok A. Tabara H.

Secondary siRNAs represent the most abundant class of endogenous small RNAs in C. elegans, are RNA-dependent RNA polymerase products, have a 5′ triphosphate, and are predominantly 22 nt in length with a 5′ guanosine (22G-RNAs). Secondary siRNA pathways and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) have not been found in vertebrates or Drosophila, but have been found in many other organisms, including nematodes, plants, fungi, and viruses. Secondary siRNA pathways in C. elegans are complex, can involve many different AGO proteins, and are only partly understood (Yigit et al., 2006Yigit E. Batista P.J. Bei Y. Pang K.M. Chen C.-C.G.

Genet. 2012; 44: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In one transgenerational paradigm, small RNA inheritance and histone H3K9me3 marks were observed for at least two generations (Gu et al., 2012Gu S.G. Pak J. Guang S. Maniar J.M. Kennedy S. Fire A.

Maures T.J. Ucar D. Hauswirth A.G. Mancini E. Lim J.P. Benayoun B.A. Shi Y. Brunet A. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2011; 479: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) were recently reported for C. elegans. These data suggest that the biological roles of transgenerational inheritance could be diverse but remain largely speculative. In addition, whether this transmission involves transgenerationally transmitted RNAs or modifications of chromatin is still controversial. Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are distinct from siRNAs and have an evolutionarily conserved role in transposon silencing in the germline in many animals, including nematodes (Malone and Hannon, 2009Malone C.D.

Here, we report how transgenerational inheritance of environmental RNAi and the piRNA pathway converge on the same germline nuclear RNAi/chromatin pathway. Both nuclear RNAi factors and chromatin regulators are essential for silencing. This pathway can elicit a long-term epigenetic memory for more than 24 generations. Once established, the initial silencing trigger is no longer required. To genetically dissect multigenerational gene silencing in C. elegans, we developed a heritable environmental RNAi paradigm. Taking advantage of the recent advance in technologies to generate single-copy intrachromosomal transgenes in C. elegans (Frøkjaer-Jensen et al., 2008Frøkjaer-Jensen C. Davis M.W. Hopkins C.E. Newman B.J. Thummel J.M. Olesen S.-P. Grunnet M. Jorgensen E.M. Single-copy insertion of transgenes in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nat.

Improved Mos1-mediated transgenesis in C. elegans.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 117-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), we generated a reporter transgene expressing a histone-GFP fusion protein in the germline of C. elegans (Figure 1A and Figure S1 available online). The use of such a defined artificial locus combines the ability to map small RNA populations, which was previously not possible using multicopy transgenes (Vastenhouw et al., 2006Vastenhouw N.L. Brunschwig K. Okihara K.L. Müller F. Tijsterman M. Plasterk R.H. Gene expression: long-term gene silencing by RNAi.Nature. 2006; 442: 882Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), with a high-throughput, quantifiable approach that was not possible using an endogenous locus (Alcazar et al., 2008Alcazar R.M. Lin R. Fire A.Z. Transmission dynamics of heritable silencing induced by double-stranded RNA in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 2008; 180: 1275-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Eliciting environmental RNAi by feeding transgenic animals with bacteria expressing dsRNA corresponding to the GFP mRNA results in gene-specific silencing of this GFP transgene (P0, Figures 1A and 1B), as expected (Timmons et al., 2001Timmons L. Court D.L. Fire A. Ingestion of bacterially expressed dsRNAs can produce specific and potent genetic interference in Caenorhabditis elegans.Gene. 2001; 263: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Transfer of these animals to a neutral environment results in a high level of silenced animals in the F1 generation, again as expected (Figure 1B) (Fire et al., 1998Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C.

Tabara H. Mello C.C. Genetic requirements for inheritance of RNAi in C. elegans.Science. 2000; 287: 2494-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Furthermore, silencing of the transgene is maintained for at least four additional generations in a subpopulation of animals. We quantified this phenomenon in thousands of animals for each generation using flow cytometry and found that inheritance of transgene silencing was maintained in more than 60% of animals for at least four generations (Figures 1C and S2). We conclude that we have established a reporter-based paradigm for the investigation of transgenerational inheritance, the “heritable RNAi defective,” or “Hrde,” sensor.Figure S1The Hrde Sensor, Related to Figure 1AShow full captionCartoon showing the components of the Hrde sensor transgene used in the transgenerational inheritance assays (top panel) and the piRNA sensor (bottom panel).

Representative, smoothed histograms showing relative GFP fluorescence of control, GFP RNAi, F1 and F2 wild-type adult animals. Raw data is gated to exclude larval animals, which cannot express the transgene. GFP fluorescence is on an arbitrary scale. As the mechanisms of transgenerational inheritance are currently not understood, we first asked whether the Hrde sensor silencing that we observed is due to posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA or (co-)transcriptional gene regulation. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we tested whether Hrde sensor silencing in the F2 generation affected either. We were able to robustly detect both primary transcript (pre-mRNA) and Hrde transgene mRNA. However, mRNA levels were significantly repressed (p < 0.05) in silenced animals as compared to nonsilenced animals (Figure 1D). pre-mRNA levels showed a similar trend. These data suggest that posttranscriptional mechanisms of silencing are required in the Hrde paradigm. We postulated that Hrde sensor transcript availability might result in continued small RNA pathway activity in silenced animals. Therefore, we profiled small RNAs using high-throughput sequencing from animals undergoing environmental RNAi (P0), control RNAi (P0), or at the F4 generation after RNAi. Small RNA libraries were prepared using protocols that did not necessitate the presence of a 5′ monophosphate to capture primary and secondary siRNAs. We detected abundant sense and antisense small RNAs during environmental RNAi (P0 generation) (Figure 1E). These small RNAs had a peak length of 21–22 nt and little bias for the 5′-most nucleotide and likely represent Dicer cleavage products (primary siRNAs) (Figure 1F). In contrast, four generations later, only antisense small RNAs remain with the characteristic signature of secondary siRNAs (22 nucleotide length with a 5′ guanosine bias, 22G RNAs). Given that each generation represents at least a hundred-fold dilution in volume (with more than 200 offspring generated by each hermaphrodite), these secondary siRNAs must be generated de novo in each generation. Animals undergoing control RNAi displayed a peak of small RNAs homologous to cloning sequences flanking the GFP minigene. These are homologous to cloning sequences that are present in the RNAi vectors and have no apparent effect on Hrde sensor activity (Figure 1C). We recently reported that piRNA-mediated silencing in the C. elegans germline results in secondary siRNA-dependent silencing of a “piRNA sensor” and endogenous piRNA targets (Bagijn et al., 2012Bagijn M.P. Goldstein L.D. Sapetschnig A. Weick E.M. Bouasker S. Lehrbach N.J. Simard M.J. Miska E.A. Function, targets, and evolution of Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs.Science. 2012; (Published online June 14, 2012)https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1220952Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus, piRNA-mediated silencing might converge on a common downstream multigenerational gene silencing pathway. To this end, we carried out forward genetic screens to identify genes required for either phenomenon using the Hrde and piRNA sensors. Using these two distinct sensors (Figure S1), one silenced by a single endogenous piRNA (piRNA sensor) and the other silenced by heritable environmental RNAi (Hrde sensor), we identified, mapped, and cloned new alleles of three known genes in small RNA pathways: nrde-2, nrde-4, and hrde-1/wago-9 (Table 1). Next, combining forward genetic screens with a candidate gene approach, we were surprised to identify a total of eight small RNA or chromatin pathway genes to be required (Table 1). For example, the Hrde sensor was desilenced in nrde-2, hrde-1/wago-9, and set-25 mutants (Figure 2A and Table 1). The products of all of these genes are either known to be, or are predicted to be, nuclear. NRDE-2 is a conserved protein involved in nuclear RNAi that is expressed in the nucleus (Guang et al., 2010Guang S. Bochner A.F. Burkhart K.B. Burton N. Pavelec D.M. Kennedy S. Small regulatory RNAs inhibit RNA polymerase II during the elongation phase of transcription.Nature. 2010; 465: 1097-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar); SET-25 is a putative histone H3 lysine-9 methyltransferase with a C-terminal SET domain. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a histone-modifying enzyme has been identified as required for multigenerational inheritance. HRDE-1/WAGO-9 is an Argonaute protein. Using immunostaining, we show that it is expressed in the germline (Figure 2B), where it localizes to the nucleus (Figures 2C and 2D). NRDE-2 was recently shown to be important in a similar inheritance paradigm (Gu et al., 2012Gu S.G. Pak J. Guang S. Maniar J.M. Kennedy S. Fire A. Amplification of siRNA in Caenorhabditis elegans generates a transgenerational sequence-targeted histone H3 lysine 9 methylation footprint.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, some genes that were previously reported to be involved in transgenerational effects appeared not to be required for our transgenerational inheritance paradigm, including hda-4, mrg-1 (Vastenhouw et al., 2006Vastenhouw N.L. Brunschwig K. Okihara K.L. Müller F. Tijsterman M. Plasterk R.H. Gene expression: long-term gene silencing by RNAi.Nature. 2006; 442: 882Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) or spr-5, lsd-1, and amx-1 (Katz et al., 2009Katz D.J. Edwards T.M. Reinke V.

A C. elegans LSD1 demethylase contributes to germline immortality by reprogramming epigenetic memory.Cell. 2009; 137: 308-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) (Table 1). For the piRNA sensor, aside from proteins that were defined in Hrde screens such as NRDE-2, HRDE-1/WAGO-9, and SET-25, we also identified additional nuclear small RNA components and chromatin factors, including NRDE-1, NRDE-4, SET-32, and one of the C. elegans heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) orthologs, HPL-2 (Table 1 and Figure S3). We conclude that there exists a common and specific nuclear RNAi/chromatin pathway in the germline that is required for environmentally induced heritable RNAi- and piRNA-induced silencing.Table 1Multigenerational Environmental RNAi and piRNA Silencing Require a Common Nuclear PathwayGenotypeGene Product(s)Reference Allele TestedAlleles Described in This StudyHeritable Environmental RNAi DefectivepiRNA Silencing Defectivewild-typeNANANA−-nrde-2novelgg91, gg95mj168 (Q135Stp)++aTested using the piRNA cherry sensor on chromosome I, as described in Bagijn et al., 2012.nrde-1novelgg88, yp4, yp5ND+nrde-4novelmj249 (Q707Stp) mj259 (Q663Stp)ND+hrde-1/wago-9nuclear Argonautetm1200mj278 (P720L)++bPreviously reported in Bagijn et al., 2012.nrde-3nuclear Argonautetm1116ND-bPreviously reported in Bagijn et al., 2012.sago-1Argonautetm1195−−bPreviously reported in Bagijn et al., 2012.sago-2Argonautetm894−−bPreviously reported in Bagijn et al., 2012.hpl-2chromo domaintm1489ND+hpl-1chromo domaintm1624ND−hpl-1; hpl-2chromo domainstm1489; tm1624ND+set-25SET domainn5021++set-32SET domainok1457ND+met-2SET domainn4256-−met-1SET domainn4337ND−lin-59SET domainn3192ND−set-2SET domainn4589ND−set-6SET domainok2195ND−set-9SET domainn4949ND−set-11SET domainn4488ND−aTested using the piRNA cherry sensor on chromosome I, as described in Bagijn et al., 2012.set-12SET domainn4442ND−hda-4histone deacetylaseok518−NDmrg-1chromo domainqa6200−NDspr-5histone demethylaseby134−NDlsd-1histone demethylasevr12−NDamx-1amine oxidaseok659−NDprg-1; prg-2Piwin4357, n4358−+bPreviously reported in Bagijn et al., 2012.prg-1Piwin4357ND+bPreviously reported in Bagijn et al., 2012., dResults are dependent on multigenerational ancestry of the animals (this study).rsd-2novelpk3307ND−rsd-6Tudor domainpk3300ND−mut-7RNase Dpk204+cThese mutants were already defective in silencing in the F1 generation.+bPreviously reported in Bagijn et al., 2012.For heritable environmental RNAi and piRNA silencing assays, intrachromosomal single-copy transgenes were used as reporters.

https://openalex.org/W2013163897,"Piwi Argonautes and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) mediate genome defense by targeting transposons. However, many piRNA species lack obvious sequence complementarity to transposons or other loci; only one C. elegans transposon is a known piRNA target. Here, we show that, in mutants lacking the Piwi Argonaute PRG-1 (and consequently its associated piRNAs/21U-RNAs), many silent loci in the germline exhibit increased levels of mRNA expression with a concomitant depletion of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)-derived secondary small RNAs termed 22G-RNAs. Sequences depleted of 22G-RNAs are proximal to potential target sites that base pair imperfectly but extensively to 21U-RNAs. We show that PRG-1 is required to initiate, but not to maintain, silencing of transgenes engineered to contain complementarity to endogenous 21U-RNAs. Our findings support a model in which C. elegans piRNAs utilize their enormous repertoire of targeting capacity to scan the germline transcriptome for foreign sequences, while endogenous germline-expressed genes are actively protected from piRNA-induced silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2131618757,"Here we embark in a deep metagenomic survey that revealed the taxonomic and potential metabolic pathways aspects of mangrove sediment microbiology. The extraction of DNA from sediment samples and the direct application of pyrosequencing resulted in approximately 215 Mb of data from four distinct mangrove areas (BrMgv01 to 04) in Brazil. The taxonomic approaches applied revealed the dominance of Deltaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria in the samples. Paired statistical analysis showed higher proportions of specific taxonomic groups in each dataset. The metabolic reconstruction indicated the possible occurrence of processes modulated by the prevailing conditions found in mangrove sediments. In terms of carbon cycling, the sequences indicated the prevalence of genes involved in the metabolism of methane, formaldehyde, and carbon dioxide. With respect to the nitrogen cycle, evidence for sequences associated with dissimilatory reduction of nitrate, nitrogen immobilization, and denitrification was detected. Sequences related to the production of adenylsulfate, sulfite, and H2S were relevant to the sulphur cycle. These data indicate that the microbial core involved in methane, nitrogen, and sulphur metabolism consists mainly of Burkholderiaceae, Planctomycetaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Desulfobacteraceae. Comparison of our data to datasets from soil and sea samples resulted in the allotment of the mangrove sediments between those samples. The results of this study add valuable data about the composition of microbial communities in mangroves and also shed light on possible transformations promoted by microbial organisms in mangrove sediments."
https://openalex.org/W1973113152,"Several people with Parkinson’s disease have been treated with intrastriatal grafts of fetal dopaminergic neurons. Following autopsy, 10–22 years after surgery, some of the grafted neurons contained Lewy bodies similar to those observed in the host brain. Numerous studies have attempted to explain these findings in cell and animal models. In cell culture, α-synuclein has been found to transfer from one cell to another, via mechanisms that include exosomal transport and endocytosis, and in certain cases seed aggregation in the recipient cell. In animal models, transfer of α-synuclein from host brain cells to grafted neurons has been shown, but the reported frequency of the event has been relatively low and little is known about the underlying mechanisms as well as the fate of the transferred α-synuclein. We now demonstrate frequent transfer of α-synuclein from a rat brain engineered to overexpress human α-synuclein to grafted dopaminergic neurons. Further, we show that this model can be used to explore mechanisms underlying cell-to-cell transfer of α-synuclein. Thus, we present evidence both for the involvement of endocytosis in α-synuclein uptake in vivo, and for seeding of aggregation of endogenous α-synuclein in the recipient neuron by the transferred α-synuclein. Finally, we show that, at least in a subset of the studied cells, the transmitted α-synuclein is sensitive to proteinase K. Our new model system could be used to test compounds that inhibit cell-to-cell transfer of α-synuclein and therefore might retard progression of Parkinson neuropathology."
https://openalex.org/W2093191258,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can lead to serious liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, about 85-90% of infected individuals become inactive carriers with sustained biochemical remission and very low risk of LC or HCC. To identify host genetic factors contributing to HBV clearance, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and replication analysis using samples from HBV carriers and spontaneously HBV-resolved Japanese and Korean individuals. Association analysis in the Japanese and Korean data identified the HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 genes with P(meta) = 1.89×10⁻¹² for rs3077 and P(meta) = 9.69×10⁻¹⁰ for rs9277542. We also found that the HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 genes were significantly associated with protective effects against chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in Japanese, Korean and other Asian populations, including Chinese and Thai individuals (P(meta) = 4.40×10⁻¹⁹ for rs3077 and P(meta) = 1.28×10⁻¹⁵ for rs9277542). These results suggest that the associations between the HLA-DP locus and the protective effects against persistent HBV infection and with clearance of HBV were replicated widely in East Asian populations; however, there are no reports of GWAS in Caucasian or African populations. Based on the GWAS in this study, there were no significant SNPs associated with HCC development. To clarify the pathogenesis of CHB and the mechanisms of HBV clearance, further studies are necessary, including functional analyses of the HLA-DP molecule."

Levels <20 ng/mL defined deficiency. Season, sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, GOLD stage, exacerbation frequency, arterial oxygen tension (PaO(2)), respiratory symptoms, depression (CES-D score≥16), comorbidities (Charlson score), treatment for osteoporosis, use of inhaled steroids, and total white blood count were examined for associations with 25(OH)D in both linear and logistic regression models.COPD patients had an increased risk for vitamin D deficiency compared to controls after adjustment for seasonality, age, smoking and BMI. Variables associated with lower 25(OH)D levels in COPD patients were obesity ( = -6.63), current smoking ( = -4.02), GOLD stage III- IV ( = -4.71, = -5.64), and depression ( = -3.29). Summertime decreased the risk of vitamin D deficiency (OR = 0.22).COPD was associated with an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, and important disease characteristics were significantly related to 25(OH)D levels."
https://openalex.org/W2036069068,"The persistent horns are an important trait of speciation for the family Bovidae with complex morphogenesis taking place briefly after birth. The polledness is highly favourable in modern cattle breeding systems but serious animal welfare issues urge for a solution in the production of hornless cattle other than dehorning. Although the dominant inhibition of horn morphogenesis was discovered more than 70 years ago, and the causative mutation was mapped almost 20 years ago, its molecular nature remained unknown. Here, we report allelic heterogeneity of the POLLED locus. First, we mapped the POLLED locus to a ∼381-kb interval in a multi-breed case-control design. Targeted re-sequencing of an enlarged candidate interval (547 kb) in 16 sires with known POLLED genotype did not detect a common allele associated with polled status. In eight sires of Alpine and Scottish origin (four polled versus four horned), we identified a single candidate mutation, a complex 202 bp insertion-deletion event that showed perfect association to the polled phenotype in various European cattle breeds, except Holstein-Friesian. The analysis of the same candidate interval in eight Holsteins identified five candidate variants which segregate as a 260 kb haplotype also perfectly associated with the POLLED gene without recombination or interference with the 202 bp insertion-deletion. We further identified bulls which are progeny tested as homozygous polled but bearing both, 202 bp insertion-deletion and Friesian haplotype. The distribution of genotypes of the two putative POLLED alleles in large semi-random sample (1,261 animals) supports the hypothesis of two independent mutations."

In this study, we explored microRNA (miRNA) regulation of follicular atresia in porcine ovary. A miRNA expression profile was constructed for healthy, early atretic, and progressively atretic follicles, and the differentially expressed miRNAs were selected and analyzed. We found that miR-26b, which was upregulated during follicular atresia, increased the number of DNA breaks and promoted granulosa cell apoptosis by targeting the ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene directly in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1993953658,"Background Electrical stimulation (ES) has been shown to promote nerve regeneration when it was applied to the proximal nerve stump. However, the possible beneficial effect of establishing a local electrical environment between a large nerve defect on nerve regeneration has not been reported in previous studies. The present study attempted to establish a local electrical environment between a large nerve defect, and examined its effect on nerve regeneration and functional recovery. Methodology/Findings In the present study, a conductive scaffold was constructed and used to bridge a 15 mm sciatic nerve defect in rats, and intermittent ES (3 V, 20 Hz) was applied to the conductive scaffold to establish an electrical environment at the site of nerve defect. Nerve regeneration and functional recovery were examined after nerve injury repair and ES. We found that axonal regeneration and remyelination of the regenerated axons were significantly enhanced by ES which was applied to conductive scaffold. In addition, both motor and sensory functional recovery was significantly improved and muscle atrophy was partially reversed by ES localized at the conductive scaffold. Further investigations showed that the expression of S-100, BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), P0 and Par-3 was significantly up-regulated by ES at the conductive scaffold. Conclusions/Significance Establishing an electrical environment with ES localized at the conductive scaffold is capable of accelerating nerve regeneration and promoting functional recovery in a 15 mm nerve defect in rats. The findings provide new directions for exploring regenerative approaches to achieve better functional recovery in the treatment of large nerve defect."
https://openalex.org/W2068430088,"In vivo studies of the metastatic process are severely hampered by the fact that most human tumor cell lines derived from highly metastatic tumors fail to consistently metastasize in immunodeficient mice like nude mice. We describe a model system based on a highly immunodeficient double knockout mouse, Rag2-/-;Il2rg-/-, which lacks T, B and NK cell activity. In this model human metastatic HER-2+ breast cancer cells displayed their full multiorgan metastatic potential, without the need for selections or additional manipulations of the system. Human HER-2+ breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-453 and BT-474 injected into Rag2-/-;Il2rg-/- mice faithfully reproduced human cancer dissemination, with multiple metastatic sites that included lungs, bones, brain, liver, ovaries, and others. Multiorgan metastatic spread was obtained both from local tumors, growing orthotopically or subcutaneously, and from cells injected intravenously. The problem of brain recurrencies is acutely felt in HER-2+ breast cancer, because monoclonal antibodies against HER-2 penetrate poorly the blood-brain barrier. We studied whether a novel oral small molecule inhibitor of downstream PI3K, selected for its penetration of the blood-brain barrier, could affect multiorgan metastatic spread in Rag2-/-;Il2rg-/- mice. NVP-BKM120 effectively controlled metastatic growth in multiple organs, and resulted in a significant proportion of mice free from brain and bone metastases. Human HER-2+ human breast cancer cells in Rag2-/-;Il2rg-/- mice faithfully reproduced the multiorgan metastatic pattern observed in patients, thus allowing the investigation of metastatic mechanisms and the preclinical study of novel antimetastatic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2130620055,"The zoonotic potential of paramyxoviruses is particularly demonstrated by their broad host range like the highly pathogenic Hendra and Nipah viruses originating from bats. But while so far all bat-borne paramyxoviruses have been identified in fruit bats across Africa, Australia, South America, and Asia, we describe the detection and characterization of the first paramyxoviruses in free-ranging European bats. Moreover, we examined the possible impact of paramyxovirus infection on individual animals by comparing histo-pathological findings and virological results. Organs from deceased insectivorous bats of various species were sampled in Germany and tested for paramyxovirus RNA in parallel to a histo-pathological examination. Nucleic acids of three novel paramyxoviruses were detected, two viruses in phylogenetic relationship to the recently proposed genus Jeilongvirus and one closely related to the genus Rubulavirus. Two infected animals revealed subclinical pathological changes within their kidneys, suggestive of a similar pathogenesis as the one described in fruit bats experimentally infected with Hendra virus. Our findings indicate the presence of bat-born paramyxoviruses in geographic areas free of fruit bat species and therefore emphasize a possible virus–host co-evolution in European bats. Since these novel viruses are related to the very distinct genera Rubulavirus and Jeilongvirus, a similarly broad genetic diversity among paramyxoviruses in other Microchiroptera compared to Megachiroptera can be assumed. Given that the infected bats were either found in close proximity to heavily populated human habitation or areas of intensive agricultural use, a potential risk of the emergence of zoonotic paramyxoviruses in Europe needs to be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2012613971,"Fragile X syndrome is caused by the absence of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein. FMRP is associated with messenger RiboNucleoParticles (mRNPs) present in polyribosomes and its absence in neurons leads to alteration in synaptic plasticity as a result of translation regulation defects. The molecular mechanisms by which FMRP plays a role in translation regulation remain elusive. Using immunoprecipitation approaches with monoclonal Ab7G1-1 and a new generation of chicken antibodies, we identified Caprin1 as a novel FMRP-cellular partner. In vivo and in vitro evidence show that Caprin1 interacts with FMRP at the level of the translation machinery as well as in trafficking neuronal granules. As an RNA-binding protein, Caprin1 has in common with FMRP at least two RNA targets that have been identified as CaMKIIα and Map1b mRNAs. In view of the new concept that FMRP species bind to RNA regardless of known structural motifs, we propose that protein interactors might modulate FMRP functions."
https://openalex.org/W2126011534,"Statins such as simvastatin are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors and standard therapy for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases in mammals. Here we show that simvastatin significantly increased the mean and maximum lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) and enhanced cardiac function in aging flies by significantly reducing heart arrhythmias and increasing the contraction proportion of the contraction/relaxation cycle. These results appeared independent of internal changes in ubiquinone or juvenile hormone levels. Rather, they appeared to involve decreased protein prenylation. Simvastatin decreased the membrane association (prenylation) of specific small Ras GTPases in mice. Both farnesyl (L744832) and type 1 geranylgeranyl transferase (GGTI-298) inhibitors increased Drosophila lifespan. These data are the most direct evidence to date that decreased protein prenylation can increase cardiac health and lifespan in any metazoan species, and may explain the pleiotropic (non-cholesterol related) health effects of statins."
https://openalex.org/W2030369847,"Sorting of cargoes in endosomes occurs through their selective enrichment into sorting platforms, where transport intermediates are generated. The WASH complex, which directly binds to lipids, activates the Arp2/3 complex and hence actin polymerization onto such sorting platforms. Here, we analyzed the role of actin polymerization in the physiology of endosomal domains containing WASH using quantitative image analysis. Actin depolymerization is known to enlarge endosomes. Using a novel colocalization method that is insensitive to the heterogeneity of size and shape of endosomes, we further show that preventing the generation of branched actin networks induces endosomal accumulation of the WASH complex. Moreover, we found that actin depolymerization induces a dramatic decrease in the recovery of endosomal WASH after photobleaching. This result suggests a built-in turnover, where the actin network, i.e. the product of the WASH complex, contributes to the dynamic exchange of the WASH complex by promoting its detachment from endosomes. Our experiments also provide evidence for a role of actin polymerization in the lateral compartmentalization of endosomes: several WASH domains exist at the surface of enlarged endosomes, however, the WASH domains coalesce upon actin depolymerization or Arp2/3 depletion. Branched actin networks are thus involved in the regulation of the size of WASH domains. The potential role of this regulation in membrane scission are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2051738870,"Tumor microenvironments present significant barriers to anti-tumor agents. Molecules involved in multicellular tumor microenvironments, however, are difficult to study ex vivo. Here, we generated a matrix-free tumor spheroid model using the NCI-H226 mesothelioma cell line and compared the gene expression profiles of spheroids and monolayers using microarray analysis. Microarray analysis revealed that 142 probe sets were differentially expressed between tumor spheroids and monolayers. Gene ontology analysis revealed that upregulated genes were primarily related to immune response, wound response, lymphocyte stimulation and response to cytokine stimulation, whereas downregulated genes were primarily associated with apoptosis. Among the 142 genes, 27 are located in the membrane and related to biologic processes of cellular movement, cell-to-cell signaling, cellular growth and proliferation and morphology. Western blot analysis validated elevation of MMP2, BAFF/BLyS/TNFSF13B, RANTES/CCL5 and TNFAIP6/TSG-6 protein expression in spheroids as compared to monolayers. Thus, we have reported the first large scale comparison of the transcriptional profiles using an ex vivo matrix-free spheroid model to identify genes specific to the three-dimensional biological structure of tumors. The method described here can be used for gene expression profiling of tumors other than mesothelioma."
https://openalex.org/W2041860523,"Background Kawasaki disease (KD) of unknown immunopathogenesis is an acute febrile systemic vasculitis and the leading cause of acquired heart diseases in childhood. To search for a better strategy for the prevention and treatment of KD, this study compared and validated human KD immunopathogenesis in a mouse model of Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract (LCWE)-induced coronary arteritis. Methods Recruited subjects fulfilled the criteria of KD and were admitted for intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) treatment at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from 2001 to 2009. Blood samples from KD patients were collected before and after IVIG treatment, and cardiovascular abnormalities were examined by transthoracic echocardiography. Wild-type male BALB/c mice (4-week-old) were intraperitoneally injected with LCWE (1 mg/mL) to induce coronary arteritis. The induced immune response in mice was examined on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 post injections, and histopathology studies were performed on days 7 and 14. Results Both human KD patients and LCWE-treated mice developed coronary arteritis, myocarditis, valvulitis, and pericarditis, as well as elevated plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in acute phase. Most of these proinflammatory cytokines declined to normal levels in mice, whereas normal levels were achieved in patients only after IVIG treatment, with a few exceptions. Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, but not TLR4 surface enhancement on circulating CD14+ monocytes, was augmented in KD patients before IVIG treatment and in LCWE-treated mice, which declined in patients after IVIG treatment. Conclusion This result suggests that that not only TLR2 augmentation on CD14+ monocytes might be an inflammatory marker for both human KD patients and LCWE-induced CAL mouse model but also this model is feasible for studying therapeutic strategies of coronary arteritis in human KD by modulating TLR2-mediated immune activation on CD14+ monocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2044224784,"Background The inflammatory properties of vein endothelium in relation to chronic venous disease (CVD) have been poorly investigated. Therefore, new insights on the characteristics of large vein endothelium would increase our knowledge of large vessel physiopathology. Methodology/Principal Findings Surgical specimens of veins were obtained from the tertiary venous network (R3) and/or saphenous vein (SF) of patients affected by CVD and from control individuals. Highly purified venous endothelial cell (VEC) cultures obtained from CVD patients were characterized for morphological, phenotypic and functional properties compared to control VEC. An increase of CD31/PECAM-1, CD146 and ICAM-1 surface levels was documented at flow cytometry in pathological VEC with respect to normal controls. Of note, the strongest expression of these pro-inflammatory markers was observed in VEC obtained from patients with more advanced disease. Similarly, spontaneous cell proliferation and resistance to starvation was higher in pathological than in normal VEC, while the migratory response of VEC showed an opposite trend, being significantly lower in VEC obtained from pathological specimens. In addition, in keeping with a higher baseline transcriptional activity of NF-kB, the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines osteoprotegerin (OPG) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was higher in pathological VEC cultures with respect to control VEC. Interestingly, there was a systemic correlation to these in vitro data, as demonstrated by higher serum OPG and VEGF levels in CVD patients with respect to normal healthy controls. Conclusion/Significance Taken together, these data indicate that large vein endothelial cells obtained from CVD patients exhibit a pro-inflammatory phenotype, which might significantly contribute to systemic inflammation in CVD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2021345242,"Host individuals are often infected with more than one parasite species (parasites defined broadly, to include viruses and bacteria). Yet, research in infection biology is dominated by studies on single-parasite infections. A focus on single-parasite infections is justified if the interactions among parasites are additive, however increasing evidence points to non-additive interactions being the norm. Here we review this evidence and theoretically explore the implications of non-additive interactions between co-infecting parasites. We use classic Lotka-Volterra two-species competition equations to investigate the within-host dynamical consequences of various mixes of competition and facilitation between a pair of co-infecting species. We then consider the implications of these dynamics for the virulence (damage to host) of co-infections and consequent evolution of parasite strategies of exploitation. We find that whereas one-way facilitation poses some increased virulence risk, reciprocal facilitation presents a qualitatively distinct destabilization of within-host dynamics and the greatest risk of severe disease."
https://openalex.org/W2054135854,"Selection of genes involved in metabolic pathways could target them differently depending on the position of genes in the pathway and on their role in controlling metabolic fluxes. This hypothesis was tested in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway using population genetics and phylogenetics.Evolutionary rates of seven genes distributed along the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, IPI, PDS, CRTISO, LCYB, LCYE, CHXE and ZEP, were compared in seven dicot taxa. A survey of deviations from neutrality expectations at these genes was also undertaken in cultivated carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus), a species that has been intensely bred for carotenoid pattern diversification in its root during its cultivation history. Parts of sequences of these genes were obtained from 46 individuals representing a wide diversity of cultivated carrots. Downstream genes exhibited higher deviations from neutral expectations than upstream genes. Comparisons of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates between genes among dicots revealed greater constraints on upstream genes than on downstream genes. An excess of intermediate frequency polymorphisms, high nucleotide diversity and/or high differentiation of CRTISO, LCYB1 and LCYE in cultivated carrot suggest that balancing selection may have targeted genes acting centrally in the pathway.Our results are consistent with relaxed constraints on downstream genes and selection targeting the central enzymes of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway during carrot breeding history."
https://openalex.org/W1987605517,"Aim To determine attrition and predictors of academic success among medical students at University of Split, Croatia. Methods We analysed academic records of 2054 students enrolled during 1979–2008 period. Results We found that 26% (533/2054) of enrolled students did not graduate. The most common reasons for attrition were ‘personal’ (36.4%), transfer to another medical school (35.6%), and dismissal due to unsatisfactory academic record (21.2%). Grade point average (GPA) and study duration of attrition students were significantly associated with parental education. There were 1126 graduates, 395 men and 731 women. Their average graduation GPA was 3.67±0.53 and study duration 7.6±2.44 years. During 5-year curriculum only 6.4% (42/654) of students graduated in time, and 55% (240/472) of students graduated in time after curriculum was extended to 6 years. Variables predicting whether a student will graduate or not were high school grades, entrance exam score and year of enrollment. Significant predictors of graduation grades were high school grades and entrance exam score. Entrance exam score predicted length of studying. Conclusion Preadmission academic qualifications and year of enrollment predict academic success in medical school. More attention should be devoted to high attrition."
https://openalex.org/W2072145659,"Plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) are piercing/sucking pests, which cause severe damage to crops worldwide, and are difficult to control. The cyst and root-knot nematodes (RKN) are sedentary endoparasites that develop specialized multinucleate feeding structures from the plant cells called syncytia or giant cells respectively. Within these structures the nematodes produce feeding tubes, which act as molecular sieves with exclusion limits. For example, Heterodera schachtii is reportedly unable to ingest proteins larger than 28 kDa. However, it is unknown yet what is the molecular exclusion limit of the Meloidogyne hapla. Several types of Bacillus thuringiensis crystal proteins showed toxicity to M. hapla. To monitor the entry pathway of crystal proteins into M. hapla, second-stage juveniles (J2) were treated with NHS-rhodamine labeled nematicidal crystal proteins (Cry55Aa, Cry6Aa, and Cry5Ba). Confocal microscopic observation showed that these crystal proteins were initially detected in the stylet and esophageal lumen, and subsequently in the gut. Western blot analysis revealed that these crystal proteins were modified to different molecular sizes after being ingested. The uptake efficiency of the crystal proteins by the M. hapla J2 decreased with increasing of protein molecular mass, based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis. Our discovery revealed 140 kDa nematicidal crystal proteins entered M. hapla J2 via the stylet, and it has important implications in designing a transgenic resistance approach to control RKN."
https://openalex.org/W1982720545,"We present a unique view of mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the North Sea based on a new time series of larvae caught by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey from 1948-2005, covering the period both before and after the collapse of the North Sea stock. Hydrographic backtrack modelling suggested that the effect of advection is very limited between spawning and larvae capture in the CPR survey. Using a statistical technique not previously applied to CPR data, we then generated a larval index that accounts for both catchability as well as spatial and temporal autocorrelation. The resulting time series documents the significant decrease of spawning from before 1970 to recent depleted levels. Spatial distributions of the larvae, and thus the spawning area, showed a shift from early to recent decades, suggesting that the central North Sea is no longer as important as the areas further west and south. These results provide a consistent and unique perspective on the dynamics of mackerel in this region and can potentially resolve many of the unresolved questions about this stock."
https://openalex.org/W1988431009,"Learning about the function and use of tools through observation requires the ability to exploit one's own knowledge derived from past experience. It also depends on the detection of low-level local cues that are rooted in the tool's perceptual properties. Best known as ‘affordances’, these cues generate biomechanical priors that constrain the number of possible motor acts that are likely to be performed on tools. The contribution of these biomechanical priors to the learning of tool-use behaviors is well supported. However, it is not yet clear if, and how, affordances interact with higher-order expectations that are generated from past experience – i.e. probabilistic exposure – to enable observational learning of tool use. To address this question we designed an action observation task in which participants were required to infer, under various conditions of visual uncertainty, the intentions of a demonstrator performing tool-use behaviors. Both the probability of observing the demonstrator achieving a particular tool function and the biomechanical optimality of the observed movement were varied. We demonstrate that biomechanical priors modulate the extent to which participants' predictions are influenced by probabilistically-induced prior expectations. Biomechanical and probabilistic priors have a cumulative effect when they ‘converge’ (in the case of a probabilistic bias assigned to optimal behaviors), or a mutually inhibitory effect when they actively ‘diverge’ (in the case of probabilistic bias assigned to suboptimal behaviors)."
https://openalex.org/W2121483399,"Background Smoking tobacco reduces lung function. African Americans have both lower lung function and decreased metabolism of tobacco smoke compared to European Americans. African ancestry is also associated with lower pulmonary function in African Americans. We aimed to determine whether African ancestry modifies the association between smoking and lung function and its rate of decline in African Americans. Methodology/Principal Findings We evaluated a prospective ongoing cohort of 1,281 African Americans participating in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study initiated in 1997. We also examined an ongoing prospective cohort initiated in 1985 of 1,223 African Americans in the Coronary Artery Disease in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. Pulmonary function and tobacco smoking exposure were measured at baseline and repeatedly over the follow-up period. Individual genetic ancestry proportions were estimated using ancestry informative markers selected to distinguish European and West African ancestry. African Americans with a high proportion of African ancestry had lower baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) per pack-year of smoking (−5.7 ml FEV1/ smoking pack-year) compared with smokers with lower African ancestry (−4.6 ml in FEV1/ smoking pack-year) (interaction P value = 0.17). Longitudinal analyses revealed a suggestive interaction between smoking, and African ancestry on the rate of FEV1 decline in Health ABC and independently replicated in CARDIA. Conclusions/Significance African American individuals with a high proportion of African ancestry are at greater risk for losing lung function while smoking."

ED was assessed using the five-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire. Total testosterone (TT), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and other biochemical profiles were measured. Free testosterone (FT) and bio-available testosterone (BT) were calculated based on Vermeulen's formula. Data were collected with regard to smoking, alcoholic drinking, physical activity and metabolic syndrome.The prevalence of ED (IIEF-5<22) was 47.6%. Men with ED were significantly older, and more prone to smoke cigarettes (≥20 cigarettes/day) or drink alcohol (≥3 drinks/week), and more likely to have elevated blood pressure (P = 0.036) or hyperglycemia (P<0.001) compared with those without ED. The significant increase in SHBG with age was parallel to its increase with increasing severity of ED (P<0.001). The obscure increase in TT across the ED status was detected without significance (P = 0.418), but TT was positively associated with ED after adjustment for age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.02, 95% CI (confidence internal): 1.00-1.04]. FT and BT were inversely associated with ED (OR = 0.14, 95%CI: 0.06-0.33; OR = 0.92 (95%CI: 0.89-0.96, respectively) in the univariate analysis, and this inverse association appeared to be independent of smoking status, alcoholic drinking, physical activity, hyper-triglyceridemia and hyperglycemia.FT and BT are inversely related to worsening ED, whereas the positive association between TT and ED is most likely due to the increase in SHBG."
https://openalex.org/W2053815501,"Introduction A rapid assessment of avoidable blindness (RAAB) was conducted in Southern Zambia to establish the prevalence and causes of blindness in order to plan effective services and advocate for support for eye care to achieve the goals of VISION 2020: the right to sight. Methods Cluster randomisation was used to select villages in the survey area. These were further subdivided into segments. One segment was selected randomly and a survey team moved from house to house examining everyone over the age of 50 years. Each individual received a visual acuity assessment and simple ocular examination. Data was recorded on a standard proforma and entered into an established software programme for analysis. Results 2.29% of people over the age of 50 were found to be blind (VA <3/60 in the better eye with available correction). The major cause of blindness was cataract (47.2%) with posterior segment disease being the next main cause (18.8%). 113 eyes had received cataract surgery with 30.1% having a poor outcome (VA <6/60) following surgery. Cataract surgical coverage showed that men (72%) received more surgery than women (65%). Discussion The results from the RAAB survey in Zambia were very similar to the results from a similar survey in Malawi, where the main cause of blindness was cataract but posterior segment disease was also a significant contributor. Blindness in this part of Zambia is mainly avoidable and there is a need for comprehensive eye care services that can address both cataract and posterior segment disease in the population if the aim of VISION 2020 is to be achieved. Services should focus on quality and gender equity of cataract surgery."
https://openalex.org/W1966506605,"The entire substrate translocation pathway in the human GABA transporter (GAT-1) was explored for the endogenous substrate GABA and the anti-convulsive drug tiagabine. Following a steered molecular dynamics (SMD) approach, in which a harmonic restraining potential is applied to the ligand, dissociation and re-association of ligands were simulated revealing events leading to substrate (GABA) translocation and inhibitor (tiagabine) mechanism of action. We succeeded in turning the transporter from the outward facing occluded to the open-to-out conformation, and also to reorient the transporter to the open-to-in conformation. The simulations are validated by literature data and provide a substrate pathway fingerprint in terms of which, how, and in which sequence specific residues are interacted with. They reveal the essential functional roles of specific residues, e.g. the role of charged residues in the extracellular vestibule including two lysines (K76 (TM1) and K448 (TM10)) and a TM6-triad (D281, E283, and D287) in attracting and relocating substrates towards the secondary/interim substrate-binding site (S2). Likewise, E101 is highlighted as essential for the relocation of the substrate from the primary substrate-binding site (S1) towards the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2051217983,"In the wild, larvae of several species of Drosophila develop in heterogeneous and rapidly changing environments sharing resources as food and space. In this scenario, sensory systems contribute to detect, localize and recognize congeners and heterospecifics, and provide information about the availability of food and chemical features of environments where animals live. We investigated the behavior of D. simulans and D. buzzatii larvae to chemicals emitted by conspecific and heterospecific larvae. Our goal was to understand the role of these substances in the selection of pupation sites in the two species that cohabit within decaying prickly pear fruits (Opuntia ficus-indica). In these breeding sites, larvae of D. simulans and D. buzzatii detect larvae of the other species changing their pupation site preferences. Larvae of the two species pupated in the part of the fruit containing no or few heterospecifics, and spent a longer time in/on spots marked by conspecifics rather than heterospecifics. In contrast, larvae of the two species reared in isolation from conspecifics pupated randomly over the substrate and spent a similar amount of time on spots marked by conspecifics and by heterospecifics. Our results indicate that early chemically-based experience with conspecific larvae is critical for the selection of the pupation sites in D. simulans and D. buzzatii, and that pupation site preferences of Drosophila larvae depend on species-specific chemical cues. These preferences can be modulate by the presence of larvae of the same or another species."
https://openalex.org/W2062098294,"α-Tropomyosin (αTm) is the predominant tropomyosin isoform in adult human heart and constitutes a major component in Ca2+-regulated systolic contraction of cardiac muscle. We present here the first direct probe images of WT human cardiac αTm by atomic force microscopy, and quantify its mechanical flexibility with three independent analysis methods. Single molecules of bacterially-expressed human cardiac αTm were imaged on poly-lysine coated mica and their contours were analyzed. Analysis of tangent-angle (θ(s)) correlation along molecular contours, second moment of tangent angles (<θ2(s)>), and end-to-end length (Le-e) distributions respectively yielded values of persistence length (Lp) of 41–46 nm, 40–45 nm, and 42–52 nm, corresponding to 1–1.3 molecular contour lengths (Lc). We also demonstrate that a sufficiently large population, with at least 100 molecules, is required for a reliable Lp measurement of αTm in single molecule studies. Our estimate that Lp for αTm is only slightly longer than Lc is consistent with a previous study showing there is little spread of cooperative activation into near-neighbor regulatory units of cardiac thin filaments. The Lp determined here for human cardiac αTm perhaps represents an evolutionarily tuned optimum between Ca2+ sensitivity and cooperativity in cardiac thin filaments and likely constitutes an essential parameter for normal function in the human heart."
https://openalex.org/W2083064848,"Background In this study, we examined alterations in the hypothalamic reward system related to high-fat diet (HFD) preferences. We previously reported that hypothalamic 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) were increased after conditioning to the rewarding properties of a HFD. Here, we hypothesized that increased 2-AG influences the hypothalamic reward system. Methods The conditioned place preference test (CPP test) was used to evaluate HFD preferences. Hypothalamic 2-AG was quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The expression of GFAP was examined by immunostaining and western blotting. Results Consumption of a HFD over either 3 or 7 days increased HFD preferences and transiently increased hypothalamic 2-AG levels. HFD consumption over 14 days similarly increased HFD preferences but elicited a long-lasting increase in hypothalamic 2-AG and GFAP levels. The cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonist O-2050 reduced preferences for HFDs after 3, 7, or 14 days of HFD consumption and reduced expression of GFAP after 14 days of HFD consumption. The astrocyte metabolic inhibitor Fluorocitrate blocked HFD preferences after 14 days of HFD consumption. Conclusions High levels of 2-AG appear to induce HFD preferences, and activate hypothalamic astrocytes via the cannabinoid system. We propose that there may be two distinct stages in the development of HFD preferences. The induction stage involves a transient increase in 2-AG, whereas the maintenance stage involves a long lasting increase in 2-AG levels and activation of astrocytes. Accordingly, hypothalamic 2-AG may influence the development of HFD preferences."
https://openalex.org/W2159404012,"MicroRNAs play a pivotal role in cellular maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation. They have also been implicated to play a key role in disease pathogenesis, and more recently, cellular reprogramming. Certain microRNA clusters can enhance or even directly induce reprogramming, while repressing key proteins involved in microRNA processing decreases reprogramming efficiency. Although microRNAs clearly play important roles in cellular reprogramming, it remains unknown whether microRNAs are absolutely necessary. We endeavored to answer this fundamental question by attempting to reprogram Dicer-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that lack almost all functional microRNAs using a defined set of transcription factors. Transduction of reprogramming factors using either lentiviral or piggyBac transposon vector into two, independently derived lines of Dicer-null MEFs failed to produce cells resembling embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, expression of human Dicer in the Dicer-null MEFs restored their reprogramming potential. Our study demonstrates for the first time that microRNAs are indispensable for dedifferentiation reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W1993444354,"Fibroblast Growth Factors play critical roles during development, tissue homeostasis and repair by controlling cell proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation. Of the 22 mammalian FGFs, FGF22, a member of the FGF7/10/22 subfamily, has been shown to have a clear role in synaptogenesis, but its roles in other tissues have not been studied. We have investigated the in vivo functions of FGF22 in mice. Fgf22 null animals were viable, fertile and did not display any obvious abnormalities. Despite the known expression profile of FGF22 in the skin, no differences in either skin or pelage were observed, demonstrating that FGF22 is dispensable during embryogenesis and in unchallenged adult skin. Mice lacking FGF22 were able to heal acute wounds just as efficiently as wild type mice. However, classical two-step skin carcinogenesis challenge revealed that FGF22 null mice developed fewer papillomas than wild type controls, suggesting a potential pro-oncogenic role for FGF22 in the skin."

We aimed to evaluate the contribution of these variants to obesity and related traits in Mexican children and adults.Rs6232 and rs6235 were genotyped in 2382 individuals, 1206 children and 1176 adults. Minor allele frequencies were 0.78% for rs6232 and 19.99% for rs6235. Rs6232 was significantly associated with childhood obesity and adult class III obesity (OR = 3.01 95%CI 1.64-5.53; P = 4 × 10⁻⁴ in the combined analysis). In addition, this SNP was significantly associated with lower fasting glucose levels (P = 0.01) and with increased insulin levels and HOMA-B (P = 0.05 and 0.01, respectively) only in non-obese children. In contrast, rs6235 showed no significant association with obesity or with glucose homeostasis parameters in any group.Although rs6232 is rare in the Mexican population, it should be considered as an important risk factor for extreme forms of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2132376224,"OVO-like proteins (OVOL) are members of the zinc finger protein family and serve as transcription factors to regulate gene expression in various differentiation processes. Recent studies have shown that OVOL genes are involved in epithelial development and differentiation in a wide variety of organisms; yet there is a lack of comprehensive studies that describe OVOL proteins from an evolutionary perspective. Using comparative genomic analysis, we traced three different OVOL genes (OVOL1-3) in vertebrates. One gene, OVOL3, was duplicated during a whole-genome-duplication event in fish, but only the copy (OVOL3b) was retained. From early-branching metazoa to humans, we found that a core domain, comprising a tetrad of C2H2 zinc fingers, is conserved. By domain comparison of the OVOL proteins, we found that they evolved in different metazoan lineages by attaching intrinsically-disordered (ID) segments of N/C-terminal extensions of 100 to 1000 amino acids to this conserved core. These ID regions originated independently across different animal lineages giving rise to different types of OVOL genes over the course of metazoan evolution. We illustrated the molecular evolution of metazoan OVOL genes over a period of 700 million years (MY). This study both extends our current understanding of the structure/function relationship of metazoan OVOL genes, and assembles a good platform for further characterization of OVOL genes from diverged organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2016931143,"The study of anticancer agents that act via stabilization of telomeric G-quadruplex DNA (G4DNA) is important because such agents often inhibit telomerase activity. Several types of G4DNA binding ligands are known. In these studies, the target structures often involve a single G4 DNA unit formed by short DNA telomeric sequences. However, the 3'-terminal single-stranded human telomeric DNA can form higher-order structures by clustering consecutive quadruplex units (dimers or n-mers). Herein, we present new synthetic gemini (twin) bisbenzimidazole ligands, in which the oligo-oxyethylene spacers join the two bisbenzimidazole units for the recognition of both monomeric and dimeric G4DNA, derived from d(T2AG3)4 and d(T2AG3)8 human telomeric DNA, respectively. The spacer between the two bisbenzimidazoles in the geminis plays a critical role in the G4DNA stability. We report here (i) synthesis of new effective gemini anticancer agents that are selectively more toxic towards the cancer cells than the corresponding normal cells; (ii) formation and characterization of G4DNA dimers in solution as well as computational construction of the dimeric G4DNA structures. The gemini ligands direct the folding of the single-stranded DNA into an unusually stable parallel-stranded G4DNA when it was formed in presence of the ligands in KCl solution and the gemini ligands show spacer length dependent potent telomerase inhibition properties."
https://openalex.org/W2016932384,"Low protein levels and copy number variation (CNV) of the fourth component of human complement (C4A and C4B) have been associated with various diseases. High-throughput methods for analysing C4 CNV are available, but they commonly do not detect the most common C4A mutation, a silencing CT insertion (CTins) leading to low protein levels. We developed a SYBR® Green labelled real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with a novel concentration range approach to address C4 CNV and deficiencies due to CTins. This method was validated in three sample sets and applied to over 1600 patient samples. CTins caused C4A deficiency in more than 70% (76/105) of the carriers. Twenty per cent (76/381) of patients with a C4A deficiency would have been erroneously recorded as having none, if the CTins had not been assessed. C4A deficiency was more common in patients than a healthy reference population, (OR = 1.60, 95%CI = 1.02-2.52, p = 0.039). The number of functional C4 genes can be straightforwardly analyzed by real-time qPCR, also with SYBR® Green labelling. Determination of CTins increases the frequency of C4A deficiency and thus helps to elucidate the genotypic versus phenotypic disease associations."
https://openalex.org/W2033638847,"NGAL/lipocalin-2 is a siderophore-binding protein that is highly expressed in several cancers. It is suggested to confer a proliferative advantage to cancer cells. Its expression has been correlated with aggressiveness of breast cancer as determined both in patients and in mouse breast cancer models. This was recently confirmed in two mouse models of spontaneous breast cancer in wild-type and lipocalin-2-deficient mice. We used a similar strategy using a different mouse strain. Lipocalin-2-deficient mice and mouse mammary tumor virus-polyoma middle T antigen (MMTV-PyMT) mice were crossed into the same FVB/N background. All mice developed tumors by week 8. The mice were sacrificed on week 13 and tissue was processed for biochemical and histological analysis. The total tumor volume and number of metastases were quantitated in 26 lipocalin-2-deficient mice and 34 wild-type controls. Lipocalin-2 expression in tumors of MMTV-PyMT-positive and wild-type mice was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and by immunohistochemistry. The expression of the lipocalin-2 receptors 24p3R and megalin and of Mmp-9, transferrin receptor, and Bdh2 (a producer of a mammalian siderophore) were quantitated by real-time PCR. No significant difference was observed between wild-type and lipocalin-2-deficient mice. Lipocalin-2 was highly expressed in tumors from wild-type mice, but the expression did not correlate with tumor size. No effect of lipocalin-2 was observed with respect to time to tumor appearance, total tumor volume, or to the number of metastases. Histology and gelatinolytic activity of the mammary tumors did not differ between wild-type and lipocalin-2-deficient mice. We conclude that NGAL/lipocalin-2 does not invariably affect the aggressiveness of breast cancers as assessed in mouse models, thus questioning the role of lipocalin-2 in cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2128457258,"Human embryonic germ cells (EGCs) provide a powerful model for identifying molecules involved in the pluripotent state when compared to their progenitors, primordial germ cells (PGCs), and other pluripotent stem cells. Microarray and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals for the first time that human EGCs possess a transcription profile distinct from PGCs and other pluripotent stem cells. Validation with qRT-PCR confirms that human EGCs and PGCs express many pluripotency-associated genes but with quantifiable differences compared to pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs), and embryonal carcinoma cells (ECCs). Analyses also identified a number of target genes that may be potentially associated with their unique pluripotent states. These include IPO7, MED7, RBM26, HSPD1, and KRAS which were upregulated in EGCs along with other pluripotent stem cells when compared to PGCs. Other potential target genes were also found which may contribute toward a primed ESC-like state. These genes were exclusively up-regulated in ESCs, IPSCs and ECCs including PARP1, CCNE1, CDK6, AURKA, MAD2L1, CCNG1, and CCNB1 which are involved in cell cycle regulation, cellular metabolism and DNA repair and replication. Gene classification analysis also confirmed that the distinguishing feature of EGCs compared to ESCs, ECCs, and IPSCs lies primarily in their genetic contribution to cellular metabolism, cell cycle, and cell adhesion. In contrast, several genes were found upregulated in PGCs which may help distinguish their unipotent state including HBA1, DMRT1, SPANXA1, and EHD2. Together, these findings provide the first glimpse into a unique genomic signature of human germ cells and pluripotent stem cells and provide genes potentially involved in defining different states of germ-line pluripotency."

https://openalex.org/W2056414808,"Enhanced matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity is implicated in the process of atherosclerotic plaque instability. We hypothesized that doxycycline, a broad MMPs inhibitor, was as effective as simvastatin in reducing the incidence of plaque disruption. Thirty rabbits underwent aortic balloon injury and were fed a high-fat diet for 20 weeks. At the end of week 8, the rabbits were divided into three groups for 12-week treatment: a doxycycline-treated group that received oral doxycycline at a dose of 10 mg/kg/d, a simvastatin-treated group that received oral simvastatin at a dose of 5 mg/kg/d, and a control group that received no treatment. At the end of week 20, pharmacological triggering was performed to induce plaque rupture. Biochemical, ultrasonographic, pathologic, immunohistochemical and mRNA expression studies were performed. The results showed that oral administration of doxycycline resulted in a significant increase in the thickness of the fibrous cap of the aortic plaque whereas there was a substantial reduction of MMPs expression, local and systemic inflammation, and aortic plaque vulnerability. The incidence of plaque rupture with either treatment (0% for both) was significantly lower than that for controls (56.0%, P<0.05). There was no significant difference between doxycycline-treated group and simvastatin-treated group in any serological, ultrasonographic, pathologic, immunohistochemical and mRNA expression measurement except for the serum lipid levels that were higher with doxycycline than with simvastatin treatment. In conclusion, doxycycline at a common antimicrobial dose stabilizes atherosclerotic lesions via inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases and attenuating inflammation in a rabbit model of vulnerable plaque. These effects were similar to a large dose of simvastatin and independent of serum lipid levels."
https://openalex.org/W2001599176,"Although children with epilepsy exhibit numerous neurological and cognitive deficits, the mechanisms underlying these impairments remain unclear. Synchronization of oscillatory neural activity in the gamma frequency range (>30 Hz) is purported to be a mechanism mediating functional integration within neuronal networks supporting cognition, perception and action. Here, we tested the hypothesis that seizure-induced alterations in gamma synchronization are associated with functional deficits. By calculating synchrony among electrodes and performing graph theoretical analysis, we assessed functional connectivity and local network structure of the hand motor area of children with focal epilepsy from intracranial electroencephalographic recordings. A local decrease in inter-electrode phase synchrony in the gamma bands during ictal periods, relative to interictal periods, within the motor cortex was strongly associated with clinical motor weakness. Gamma-band ictal desychronization was a stronger predictor of deficits than the presence of the seizure-onset zone or lesion within the motor cortex. There was a positive correlation between the magnitude of ictal desychronization and impairment of motor dexterity in the contralateral, but not ipsilateral hand. There was no association between ictal desynchronization within the hand motor area and non-motor deficits. This study uniquely demonstrates that seizure-induced disturbances in cortical functional connectivity are associated with network-specific neurological deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2081116856,"Leukodystrophies (LD) are rare inherited disorders that primarily affect the white matter (WM) of the central nervous system. The large heterogeneity of LD results from the diversity of the genetically determined defects that interfere with glial cells functions. Astrocytes have been identified as the primary target of LD with cystic myelin breakdown including those related to mutations in the ubiquitous translation initiation factor eIF2B. EIF2B is involved in global protein synthesis and its regulation under normal and stress conditions. Little is known about how eIF2B mutations have a major effect on WM. We performed a transcriptomic analysis using fibroblasts of 10 eIF2B-mutated patients with a severe phenotype and 10 age matched patients with other types of LD in comparison to control fibroblasts. ANOVA was used to identify genes that were statistically significantly differentially expressed at basal state and after ER-stress. The pattern of differentially expressed genes between basal state and ER-stress did not differ significantly among each of the three conditions. However, 70 genes were specifically differentially expressed in eIF2B-mutated fibroblasts whatever the stress conditions tested compared to controls, 96% being under-expressed. Most of these genes were involved in mRNA regulation and mitochondrial metabolism. The 13 most representative genes, including genes belonging to the Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein (HNRNP) family, described as regulators of splicing events and stability of mRNA, were dysregulated during the development of eIF2B-mutated brains. HNRNPH1, F and C mRNA were over-expressed in foetus but under-expressed in children and adult brains. The abnormal regulation of HNRNP expression in the brain of eIF2B-mutated patients was concomitant with splicing dysregulation of the main genes involved in glial maturation such as PLP1 for oligodendrocytes and GFAP in astrocytes. These findings demonstrate a developmental deregulation of splicing events in glial cells that is related to abnormal production of HNRNP, in eIF2B-mutated brains."
https://openalex.org/W2004877271,"Background Phospholipase C (PLC) is an enzyme that plays pivotal role in a number of signaling cascades. These are active in the plasma membrane and triggers cellular responses by catalyzing the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and thereby generating the secondary messengers. Phosphatidylinositol-PLC (PI-PLC) specifically interacts with phosphoinositide and/or phosphoinositol and catalyzes specific cleavage of sn-3- phosphodiester bond. Several isoforms of PLC are known to form and function as dimer but very little is known about the molecular basis of the dimerization and its importance in the lipid interaction. Principal Findings We herein report that, the disruption of disulphide bond of a novel PI-specific PLC of C. reinhardtii (CrPLC) can modulate its interaction affinity with a set of phospholipids and also the stability of its dimer. CrPLC was found to form a mixture of higher oligomeric states with monomer and dimer as major species. Dimer adduct of CrPLC disappeared in the presence of DTT, which suggested the involvement of disulphide bond(s) in CrPLC oligomerization. Dimer-monomer equilibrium studies with the isolated fractions of CrPLC monomer and dimer supported the involvement of covalent forces in the dimerization of CrPLC. A disulphide bridge was found to be responsible for the dimerization and Cys7 seems to be involved in the formation of the disulphide bond. This crucial disulphide bond also modulated the lipid affinity of CrPLC. Oligomers of CrPLC were also captured in in vivo condition. CrPLC was mainly found to be localized in the plasma membrane of the cell. The cell surface localization of CrPLC may have significant implication in the downstream regulatory function of CrPLC. Significance This study helps in establishing the role of CrPLC (or similar proteins) in the quaternary structure of the molecule its affinities during lipid interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2046233961,"Background Although the benefits of physical activity in preventing chronic medical conditions are well established, its impacts on infectious diseases, and seasonal influenza in particular, are less clearly defined. We examined the association between physical activity and influenza-coded outpatient visits, as a proxy for influenza infection. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a cohort study of Ontario respondents to Statistics Canada’s population health surveys over 12 influenza seasons. We assessed physical activity levels through survey responses, and influenza-coded physician office and emergency department visits through physician billing claims. We used logistic regression to estimate the risk of influenza-coded outpatient visits during influenza seasons. The cohort comprised 114,364 survey respondents who contributed 357,466 person-influenza seasons of observation. Compared to inactive individuals, moderately active (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.74–0.94) and active (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77–0.98) individuals were less likely to experience an influenza-coded visit. Stratifying by age, the protective effect of physical activity remained significant for individuals <65 years (active OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.75–0.98, moderately active: OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.74–0.97) but not for individuals ≥65 years. The main limitations of this study were the use of influenza-coded outpatient visits rather than laboratory-confirmed influenza as the outcome measure, the reliance on self-report for assessing physical activity and various covariates, and the observational study design. Conclusion/Significance Moderate to high amounts of physical activity may be associated with reduced risk of influenza for individuals <65 years. Future research should use laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes to confirm the association between physical activity and influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2049956343,"Existing technologies allow isolating antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from B cells. We devised a direct approach to isolate mAbs with predetermined conformational epitope specificity, using epitope mimetics (mimotopes) that reflect the three-dimensional structure of given antigen subdomains. We performed differential biopanning using bacteriophages encoding random peptide libraries and polyclonal antibodies (Abs) that had been affinity-purified with either native or denatured antigen. This strategy yielded conformational mimotopes. We then generated mimotope-fluorescent protein fusions, which were used as baits to isolate single memory B cells from rhesus monkeys (RMs). To amplify RM immunoglobulin variable regions, we developed RM-specific PCR primers and generated chimeric simian-human mAbs with predicted epitope specificity. We established proof-of-concept of our strategy by isolating mAbs targeting the conformational V3 loop crown of HIV Env; the new mAbs cross-neutralized viruses of different clades.

Overexpression of p53 causes rapid SHP protein degradation, which does not require the presence of Mdm2 and is mediated by the proteosome pathway. Overexpressing SHP alone does not affect p53 stability. However, SHP destabilizes p53 by augmentation of Mdm2 ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53. The single amino acid substitution in the SHP protein SHPK170R increases SHP binding to p53 relative to SHP wild-type, whereas SHPG171A variant shows a diminished p53 binding. As a result of the cross-regulation, the tumor suppressor function of p53 and SHP in inhibition of colon cancer growth is compromised. Our findings reveal a unique scenario for a cross-inhibition between two tumor suppressors to keep their expression and function in check."

Theories ranging from incompetence of the venous valves to structural changes in the vein wall have been proposed.We analyzed the functional state of the intramural smooth muscle cells (n = 14 pairs matched for age and gender) and the expression of relaxin-2 and its receptors RXFP1 and RXFP2 in samples of varicose and healthy great saphenous veins (GSV) (n = 21 healthy GSV; n = 46 varicose GSV). Relaxin-2 and RXFP1 contents were determined in tissue samples (n = 9 samples per group). Pharmacological analyses were performed in a perfusion chamber. Morphometric determination of the nuclear size of the smooth muscle compartment yielded no significant difference in varicose GSV in comparison with the healthy controls. Relaxin-2 and its receptors were expressed in the muscular layer, endothelial cells and in blood vessels contained in the vein wall. Immunohistochemical expression of relaxin-2, RXFP1 and RXFP2 was significantly decreased in varicose GSV. Relaxin-2 and RXFP1 measured by ELISA and Western Blot were decreased in varicose GSV (relaxin-2 ELISA healthy vs. varicose GSV: 12.49±0.66 pg/mg versus 9.12±3.39 pg/mg of total protein; p = 0.01; Student's T-test). Contractions of vein samples induced by cholinergic or adrenergic stimulation were antagonized by relaxin-2.We report that relaxin-2 and its receptors RXFP1 and RXFP2 are expressed in GSV and that their expression is significantly decreased in varicose GSV. Further, we were able to demonstrate a functional pharmacological relaxin-2 system in varicose GSV. Our results suggest a novel role for relaxin-2 in the pathogenesis of primary varicosis, rendering relaxin-2 a novel possible pharmacological agent for the treatment of this widely prevailing venous disease."
https://openalex.org/W2085980881,"Simulating signal transduction in cellular signaling networks provides predictions of network dynamics by quantifying the changes in concentration and activity-level of the individual proteins. Since numerical values of kinetic parameters might be difficult to obtain, it is imperative to develop non-parametric approaches that combine the connectivity of a network with the response of individual proteins to signals which travel through the network. The activity levels of signaling proteins computed through existing non-parametric modeling tools do not show significant correlations with the observed values in experimental results. In this work we developed a non-parametric computational framework to describe the profile of the evolving process and the time course of the proportion of active form of molecules in the signal transduction networks. The model is also capable of incorporating perturbations. The model was validated on four signaling networks showing that it can effectively uncover the activity levels and trends of response during signal transduction process."
https://openalex.org/W2093766977,"Conformational changes are essential for protein-protein and protein-ligand recognition. Here we probed changes in the structure of the protein ubiquitin at low temperatures in supercooled water using NMR spectroscopy. We demonstrate that ubiquitin is well folded down to 263 K, although slight rearrangements in the hydrophobic core occur. However, amide proton chemical shifts show non-linear temperature dependence in supercooled solution and backbone hydrogen bonds become weaker in the region that is most prone to cold-denaturation. Our data suggest that the weakening of the hydrogen bonds in the β-sheet of ubiquitin might be one of the first events that occur during cold-denaturation of ubiquitin. Interestingly, the same region is strongly involved in ubiquitin-protein complexes suggesting that this part of ubiquitin more easily adjusts to conformational changes required for complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W2008446759,"Agriculture is inherently risky. Drought is a particularly troublesome hazard that has a documented adverse impact on agricultural development. A long history of decision-support tools have been developed to try and help farmers or policy makers manage risk. We offer site-specific drought insurance methodology as a significant addition to this process. Drought insurance works by encapsulating the best available scientific estimate of drought probability and severity at a site within a single number- the insurance premium, which is offered by insurers to insurable parties in a transparent risk-sharing agreement. The proposed method is demonstrated in a case study for dry beans in Nicaragua."
