https://openalex.org/W1561096292,"We have characterized further the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) identified in the 5'-flanking region of the rat glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit gene and the NAD(P)H:quinone reductase gene by mutational and deletion analyses. Our data suggest that the sequence, 5'-puGTGACNNNGC-3' 3'-pyCACTGNNNCG-5' where N is any nucleotide, represents the core sequence of the ARE required for transcriptional activation by phenolic antioxidants and metabolizable planar aromatic compounds (e.g. beta-naphthoflavone and 3-methylcholanthrene). We also have found that the ARE is responsive to hydrogen peroxide and phenolic antioxidants that undergo redox cycling. These latter data suggest that the ARE is responsive to reactive oxygen species and thus may represent part of a signal transduction pathway that allow eukaryotic cells to sense and respond to oxidative stress."

https://openalex.org/W1999772524,"Muscarinic and α-adrenergic suppression of current through Ca2+ channels was studied in adult rat superior cervical ganglion neurons using whole-cell and cell-attached configurations of the patch-clamp technique. Oxotremorine methiodide suppressed Ica by both a rapid (<1 s) and a slow (>4 s) process, whereas norepinephrine suppressed Ica only by a rapid process. The slow muscarinic suppression could be prevented by adding 20 mM BAPTA, a Ca2+ chelator, to the recording pipette, whereas the adrenergic suppression was not affected. Muscarinic, but not α-adrenergic, receptors can couple to Ca2+ channels by a second messenger capable of diffusing into an on-cell patch. This signal seems not to be carried by intracellular Ca2+ cGMP, cAMP, or protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1604304986,"The 33- and 23-kDa proteins of the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving complex are synthesized in the cytosol as larger precursors and transported into the thylakoid lumen via stromal intermediate forms. We have investigated the energetics of protein transport across the thylakoid membrane using import assays that utilize either intact chloroplasts or isolated thylakoids. We have found that the light-driven import of the 23-kDa protein into isolated thylakoids is almost completely inhibited by electron transport inhibitors or by the ionophore nigericin but not by valinomycin. These compounds have similar effects in chloroplast import assays: precursors of both the 33- and 23-kDa proteins are imported and processed to intermediate forms in the stroma, but transport into the thylakoid lumen is blocked when electron transport is inhibited or nigericin is present. These results indicate that the transport of these proteins across the thylakoid membrane requires a protonmotive force and that the dominant component in this respect is the proton gradient and not the electrical potential."
https://openalex.org/W1911175850,"We have cloned a gene encoding a mitochondrial inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by low stringency hybridization to PPA1, the yeast gene for cytoplasmic PPase. The new gene, PPA2, is located on chromosome 13 and encodes a protein whose sequence is 49% identical to the cytoplasmic enzyme. The protein differs from cytoplasmic PPase in that it has a leader sequence enriched in basic and hydroxylated residues, which is typically found in mitochondrial proteins. Yeast cells overproducing PPA2 had a 47-fold increase in mitochondrial PPase activity. This activity was further stimulated 3-fold by the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, which suggests that PPA2 is part of an energy-linked enzyme. Using gene disruptions, we found that PPA1 is required for cell growth. In contrast, cells disrupted for PPA2 are viable, but unable to grow on respiratory carbon sources. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that these cells have lost their mitochondrial DNA. We conclude that the mitochondrial PPase encoded by PPA2 is essential for mitochondrial function and maintenance of the mitochondrial genome."
https://openalex.org/W2131684714,"We examined the effect of cGMP on Na+/Ca2+ exchange in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in primary culture. The intracellular Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) was raised by adding ionomycin to VSMCs incubated at high extracellular pH (pH0) (pH0 = 8.8) and high extracellular Mg2+ (Mg2+0) (Mg2+0 = 20 mM), conditions that inhibit activity of the sarcolemmal Ca2+ pump. 45Ca2+ efflux observed under these conditions was mostly extracellular Na+ (Na+0)-dependent and thus presumably catalyzed by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Brief treatment of VSMCs with 8-bromo-cGMP or atrial natriuretic peptide increased this Na+0-dependent 45Ca2+ efflux by about 50%. The 8-bromo-cGMP treatment did not significantly influence total cell Na+, membrane potential, and cell pH. Conversely, when VSMCs were loaded with Na+ and then exposed to a Na+0-free medium, the rate of 45Ca2+ uptake into VSMCs increased as cell Na+ increased. Prior treatment of VSMCs with 8-bromo-cGMP accelerated 45Ca2+ uptake by up to 60% without influencing Na+ loading itself. Treatment of VSMCs with 25 microM 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone, an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, induced a transient elevation of [Ca2+]i. 8-Bromo-cGMP stimulated the rate of recovery phase of this Ca2+ transient measured in the high pHo/high Mg2+o medium. All these results indicate that cGMP stimulates Na+/Ca2+ exchange in VSMCs."

https://openalex.org/W2092835944,"In vitro phosphorylation of multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) converts it to a form that is independent of Ca2+. We demonstrate that significant Ca2+-independent CaM kinase activity is present in untreated hippocampal slices. Two manipulations that produce a long-lasting enhancement of neuronal activity in hippocampal slices, elevated extracellular Ca2+ or depolarization with high K+, generate additional Ca2+-independent activity. This increase is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and is correlated with an increased phosphorylation of CaM kinase. In contrast, CaM kinase in posterior pituitary, a brain structure that is not thought to be involved in memory-related processes, is not modulated by depolarization. These results suggest that the Ca2+-independent form of CaM kinase may modulate neuronal activity in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W1561651859,"The handle region (residues 84-99) in ribonuclease HI (RNase HI) from Escherichia coli, which is rich in basic amino acid residues, was altered by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Fifteen mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity and analyzed for the enzymatic activity. A mutation of either of 2 tryptophan residues at 85 or 90 resulted in a large increase in the Km value along with a large decrease in the Vmax value. These values probably resulted from conformational changes introduced by the mutations as indicated by the CD spectra of these mutant proteins. All other mutant enzymes had Vmax values similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, replacement of any basic amino acid residue in the handle region, except for lysine 86, yielded proteins whose Km values were 3-5-fold higher than the wild-type enzyme. Such effects were shown to be cumulative, suggesting strongly that the cluster of positive charges in the handle region is important for the effective binding of the substrate. Interestingly, the region of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase with homology to E. coli RNase HI lacks the handle region which may account for the poor RNase H activity of the domain when separated from the polymerase domain."

https://openalex.org/W1572468114,"By altering the Na+/K+ electrochemical gradient, Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity profoundly influences cardiac cell excitability and contractility. The recent finding of mineralocorticoid hormone receptors in the heart implies that Na+,K(+)-ATPase gene expression, and hence cardiac function, is regulated by aldosterone, a corticosteroid hormone associated with certain forms of hypertension and classically involved in regulating Na+,K(+)-ATPase gene expression and transepithelial Na+ transport in tissues such as the kidney. The regulation by aldosterone of the major cardiac Na+,K(+)-ATPase isoform genes, alpha-1 and beta-1, were studied in adult and neonatal rat ventricular cardiocytes grown in defined serum-free media. In both cell types, aldosterone-induced a rapid and sustained 3-fold induction in alpha-1 mRNA accumulation within 6 h. beta-1 mRNA was similarly induced. alpha-1 mRNA induction occurred over the physiological range with an EC50 of 1-2 nM, consistent with binding of aldosterone to the high affinity mineralocorticoid hormone receptor. In adult cardiocytes, this was associated with a 36% increase in alpha subunit protein accumulation and an increase in Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase transport activity. Aldosterone did not alter the 3-h half-life of alpha-1 mRNA, indicating an induction of alpha-1 mRNA synthesis. Aldosterone-dependent alpha-1 mRNA accumulation was not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, whereas amiloride inhibited both an aldosterone-dependent increase in intracellular Na+ [Na+]i) and alpha-1 mRNA accumulation. This demonstrates that aldosterone directly stimulates Na+,K(+)-ATPase alpha-1 subunit mRNA synthesis and protein accumulation in cardiac cells throughout development and suggests that the heart is a mineralocorticoid-responsive organ. An early increase in [Na+]i may be a proximal event in the mediation of the hormone effect."
https://openalex.org/W1921231008,"The medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (mTALH) contributes importantly to the regulation of extracellular fluid volume and composition and metabolizes arachidonic acid (AA) chiefly by a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase pathway. Rabbit mTALH cells, when incubated with radiolabeled [14C]AA, form products that segregate into two peaks designated P1 and P2 based on their reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography retention times. We have now definitively identified their chemical structures. mTALH cells, isolated from the rabbit outer medulla, were homogenized and incubated with [14C]AA in the presence of NADPH. The AA metabolites in P1 and P2 were identified by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric methods, including fast atom bombardment, negative ion electron capture, and electron ionization. All mass spectrometric data, the lack of UV chromophores, and comparisons with authentic standards were consistent with P1 containing two principal components: 19-hydroxy-5,8,11,14 eicosatetraenoic acid (19-HETE) and 20 - hydroxy - 5,8,11,14 - eicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), P2 contained primarily 1,20-eicosa-5,8,11,14-tetraenedioic acid (20-COOH-AA). The biological properties of P1 and P2 were compared with those of the authentic standards of 19- and 20-HETE and 20-COOH-AA. P1 dose dependently relaxed precontracted mesenteric arterial rings, as did authentic (19S)- and (19R)-HETE, whereas 20-HETE relaxed at lower and contracted at higher concentrations. As P1 contained a mixture of 19- and 20-HETE, each of these AA metabolites presumably contributed to the vascular relaxation produced by P1. Neither P2 nor 20-COOH-AA exhibited vasoactivity, but each demonstrated a similar potency in inhibiting rabbit medullary Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity. As previously reported, P2 was a more potent inhibitor of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase than P1. The lesser inhibitory activity of P1 presumably reflects the presence of similar amounts of 19-HETE, the least active metabolite, and 20-HETE, which resembles 20-COOH-AA in its capacity to inhibit Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase. Thus, the biological activity of the less polar peak, P1, can be accounted for by 19- and 20-HETE, and that of P2, by 20-COOH-AA."
https://openalex.org/W1522815859,"The chlorate-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli are affected in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor and show pleiotropic loss of the activities of those enzymes which require the cofactor. The molybdenum cofactor in all molybdoenzymes other than nitrogenase is a complex of the metal with a unique pterin termed molybdopterin. The molybdenum cofactor in a number of E. coli enzymes has been shown to contain GMP in addition to the metal-molybdopterin complex, with the GMP appended in pyrophosphate linkage to the terminal phosphate ester on the molybdopterin side chain. In this paper, we have examined the biochemistry of the chlB mutant and show that the gene product of the chlB locus is essential for the addition of the GMP moiety to form molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide, a step which occurs late in the cofactor biosynthetic pathway in E. coli. Sensitive techniques were developed for the identification of fluorescent derivatives of molybdopterin and of molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide in extracts of E. coli cells. Wild type cells were shown to contain both molybdopterin and molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide, while cells of chlB mutants were found to contain elevated levels of molybdopterin but no detectable molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1578437221,"A highly repetitive DNA element, homologous to the mariner transposon of Drosophila mauritiana was found in the intron of the gene for cecropin A, an antibacterial peptide from the Cecropia moth. The mariner-like elements (MLE) represent a homogeneous population with a copy number of about 1000/genome. Sequencing analysis showed it to be 1255 base pairs long, including 38-base pair terminal inverted repeats. The MLE contains a defective reading frame. Nevertheless, the putative product is clearly homologous to the predicted translation product encoded by mariner. In consonance is also the fact that the inverted repeats are highly conserved between the two elements and that the overall DNA homology is 48%. Since the mariner element is present in several Drosophila species closely related to Drosophila melanogaster and since MLE is present in the lepidopteran Cecropia, a route of horizontal transfer is indicated rather than vertical transmission from a common ancestor. This suggests the possible use of mariner for the construction of an interspecies vector."
https://openalex.org/W1610613138,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) binds to a low affinity cell surface receptor (p75NGFR) which contains four extracellular repeats, rich in cysteine residues and negatively charged. We have made mutations in the receptor cDNA by inserting linkers in specific domains of the receptor. Nearly all the mutations caused a change in the predicted charge, and resulted in either an insertion or deletion in the primary sequence. Stably transfected fibroblasts were assayed for NGF binding by affinity cross-linking with 125I-NGF. Appropriate expression of the mutated receptors was monitored by rosetting with monoclonal antibodies and by metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation. Although the mutant receptors were recognized by monoclonal antibodies, insertions and deletions in the third and fourth cysteine-rich regions of the receptor had a detrimental effect upon NGF binding. Insertions made outside the cysteine-rich region or in the cytoplasmic domain did not inhibit the ability of 125I-NGF to bind to the receptor, as assessed by affinity cross-linking. A chimeric human-rat NGF receptor transfected into fibroblasts indicates that NGF binding and monoclonal antibody recognition sites are separated but contained within the four cysteine repeats."
https://openalex.org/W1621199903,"The theme of this study is an evaluation of the involvement of cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in the regulation of the human heat shock protein (hsp) 70 gene promoter. Expression of a highly specific protein inhibitor of PKA (pRSVPKI) inhibited the basal as well as heat- and cadmium-induced expression of the cotransfected pHBCAT, a human hsp 70 promoter-driven reporter gene; this inhibition was dependent on the amount of pRSVPKI used. The effect of an expression vector of the RI regulatory subunit of PKA, pMTREV, was similar to that of pRSVPKI; pMTREV inhibited both the basal as well as the heat-induced expression of pHBCAT. The specificity of effects of these expression vectors was demonstrated by the lack of effect of a mutant PKI gene and by the unaffected expression of a reference gene (pRSV beta gal) under these conditions. Analysis of the effects of dibutyryl cAMP (1 mM), forskolin (10 microM), and 8-Br-cAMP (1 mM) on the transient expression of pHBCAT showed that these cAMP-elevating agents stimulated the hsp 70 promoter activity, whereas cAMP (1 mM) was without effect. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene constructs with truncated or mutated hsp 70 promoter were used to define the cis-acting DNA element(s) that confer this cAMP stimulation; the heat induced (42 degrees C) expression was used as a control. Mutation of the adenovirus transcription factor element (pLSN-40/-26) greatly reduced the basal level of expression; forskolin had little or no effect on this adenovirus transcription factor-minus promoter, although the promoter activity was very heat inducible. The absence of a functional heat shock consensus element (HSE) in the construct pLSPNWT rendered the promoter heat insensitive; this construct was forskolin responsive although the magnitude of this stimulation was reduced when compared with that of a control construct with HSE. These results were corroborated by studies using consensus sequence of ATF (ATFE) and HSE as competitors to titrate our cellular factors that may interact with these elements. We showed that cotransfection with ATFE and HSE depressed the basal (37 degrees C) expression of pHBCAT by 25 and 60%, respectively. The heat-induced expression of pHBCAT was not significantly affected by the cotransfection of ATFE and was reduced by 60% when HSE was cotransfected. ATFE and HSE reduced the forskolin-induced pHBCAT expression by 70 and 40%, respectively. The implications of these findings as they relate to the action of cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the control of heat shock gene expression are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1589058355,"Cross-regulation from the stimulatory (Gs alpha)-mediated) to the inhibitory (Gi alpha-mediated) pathways controlling adenylylcyclase has been described (Hadcock, J. R., Ros, M., Watkins, D. C., and Malbon, C. C. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14784-14790). The extent to which cross-regulation occurs from inhibitory to stimulatory pathways for adenylylcyclase was explored. Persistent activation of the inhibitory pathway of adenylylcyclase by the A1-adenosine receptor agonist (-)-N6 (R-phenylisopropyl) adenosine (PIA) in hamster smooth muscle DDT1 MF-2 cells enhanced the stimulatory pathway of adenylylcyclase and its activation by the beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. PIA treatment (48 h) of cells increased isoproterenol-stimulated adenylylcyclase by 2-fold. In addition, the ED50 for stimulation of adenylylcyclase by isoproterenol decreased 50-fold to approximately 1 nM. Persistent activation of cells with PIA increased beta 2-adrenergic receptor number in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The steady-state levels of beta 2-adrenergic receptors (radioligand binding and immunoblotting) and receptor mRNA levels increased by more than 70%, while the half-life of the receptor (24 h) was unaltered. Both A1-adenosine receptor binding and Gi alpha 2 levels declined by half in cells persistently activated with PIA. Although Gi alpha 2 mRNA levels and the relative rate of synthesis of Gi alpha 2 protein upon persistent activation of the inhibitory pathway were found to increase, a decrease in the half-life of Gi alpha 2 from approximately 75 h in naive cells to approximately 40 in cells provides the basis for the decline in Gi alpha 2 levels. The steady-state level of mRNA and half-life of Gs alpha protein were unaltered in persistently activated cells. Thus, activation of the inhibitory pathway of adenylylcyclase cross-regulates the stimulatory, hormone-sensitive adenylylcyclase system by: (i) up-regulating beta 2-adrenergic receptors and enhancing the activation of the stimulatory adenylylcyclase pathway and (ii) down-regulating elements of the inhibitory adenylylcyclase pathway (Gi alpha 2 and A1-adenosine receptor binding)."
https://openalex.org/W1555570350,"We have determined the structures and thermodynamic stabilities of the wild type Asn-52 and unusually thermostable mutant Ile-52 yeast iso-1-cytochromes c (Das, G., Hickey, D. R. McLendon, D., McLendon, G., and Sherman, F. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 496-499). Although both structures were similar, Water-166, buried within the wild type protein, is excluded from the Ile-52 mutant, which substantially reorganizes the local hydrogen bonding. Wild type Cys-102 was replaced with alanine or serine to eliminate dimerization in vitro. The Cys-102 (wild type), Ala-102, and Ser-102 proteins were equally stable, whereas the chemically modified Cys-102-SCH3 was less stable. The order of stability observed with replacements at positions 52 and 102 was as follows: Ile-52 Ala-102 greater than Ala-52 Ala-102 greater than Asn-52 Ala-102 (normal) greater than Gly-52 Ala-102. No significant stabilization was attributed to potential energy interactions expressed as helix-forming propensities of replacements at position 52. A high correlation between differences in free energy changes and transfer free energies suggests hydrophobic interactions are the main factor for enhancing stability in the Ile-52 mutant. Additional possible contributions to the thermostability of the Ile-52 variant are energetic effects due to packing and hydrogen bonding changes surrounding position 52."
https://openalex.org/W1551997271,"In FRTL-5 thyroid cells, thyrotropin (TSH) stimulates I- efflux in association with phospholipase C activation and Ca2+ mobilization. TSH also stimulates DNA synthesis, accompanied by cAMP accumulation. Significant activation of the phospholipase C-Ca2+ pathway requires 10-100 nM TSH a concentration 10(3) to 10(4) times higher than necessary to stimulate the cAMP pathway. When the P1-purinergic agonist, phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) is added to the reaction medium, the former pathway is markedly enhanced, whereas the latter pathway is inhibited. As a result, in the presence of PIA, both TSH-induced pathways are activated at similar TSH concentrations. These PIA actions are completely reversed by a prior treatment of cells with islet-activating protein (IAP); pertussis toxin. When adenosine deaminase is added to the reaction medium, TSH-induced cAMP accumulation is significantly enhanced, suggesting an autocrine action of adenosine. In IAP-treated cells, the level of TSH-induced cAMP accumulation reaches that of deaminase-treated control cells, and no further increase is observed when adenosine deaminase is added. We conclude that in the thyroid, either an neural or autocrine adenosine signal, mediated by an IAP-sensitive G-protein, switches TSH signal transduction from the cAMP pathway to the phospholipase C-Ca2+ pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1513753334,"The effect of glucose on the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) of pancreatic beta-cells from ob/ob-mice was examined by dual wavelength recordings of the 340/380 nm fluorescence excitation ratio of fura-2. Single beta-cells responded to 11-20 mM glucose with an initial lowering of [Ca2+]i, followed by an increase usually manifested as large amplitude oscillations (300-500 nm) with a frequency of 0.2-0.5/min (a-type). Particularly in freshly isolated beta-cells, there were also superimposed fast oscillations with frequencies of 2-8/min amplitudes in the 70-250 nM range (b-type) and sometimes pronounced [Ca2+]i transients exceeding 250 nM with durations below 10 s (c-type). After addition of 1-100 nM glucagon or 1 mM of the dibutyryl or 8-bromo derivatives of cyclic AMP, glucose generated numerous b-type oscillations superimposed on those of the a-type or on an elevated steady-state level. The duration of the b-type oscillations increased slightly when glucose was raised from 11 to 16 mM. The c-type transients probably represent a separate reaction predominantly seen when raising cyclic AMP much above its normal concentration. It is concluded that glucose can induce fast oscillations of [Ca2+]i also in isolated beta-cells, especially when measures are taken to increase their cyclic AMP content."
https://openalex.org/W1970019106,"NGF treatment of PC12 cells results in the rapid activation of MAP2 kinase. We report here that the induction of enzyme activity was correlated with the phosphorylation of MAP2 kinase, detected by metabolic labeling of the enzyme and with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. NGF stimulated the phosphorylation of MAP2 kinase on tyrosine, as well as serine and threonine residues. Western blot analysis using a polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated that the tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP2 kinase was maximal within 2 min following NGF exposure and preceded the induction of MAP2 kinase activity. The NGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of an identified substrate provides direct evidence for the participation of a tyrosine kinase in the mechanism of action of NGF."

https://openalex.org/W1562207750,"The mechanism for the generation of the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-independent activity of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II) by autophosphorylation was studied by characterizing the autothiophosphorylated enzyme, which is resistant to hydrolysis. When CaM-kinase II was incubated with adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) at 5 degrees C, the incorporation of thiophosphate into the enzyme occurred rapidly, reaching a maximum level within a few minutes, in parallel with increase in Ca2+/CaM-independent activity. The maximum level was 1 mol of thiophosphate per mol of subunit of the enzyme, and the thiophosphorylation occurred exclusively at Thr286 in the alpha subunit and Thr287 in the other subunits of the enzyme. These results, taken together, indicate that the autothiophosphorylation of Thr286/Thr287 of each subunit is involved in the generation of the Ca2+/CaM-independent activity. The activity of the autothiophosphorylated enzyme, when assayed in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, showed the same kinetic properties as did the Ca2+/CaM-dependent activity of the original non-phosphorylated enzyme, but when assayed in the absence of Ca2+/CaM, it showed the same Vmax as the Ca2+/CaM-dependent activity but higher Km values for protein substrates. Thus, the phosphorylation of Thr286/Thr287 of the subunit of the enzyme by autophosphorylation appears to not only enhance the affinity of its substrate-binding site for the protein substrate, although it is lower than that of the enzyme activated by the binding of CaM, but also convert the active site to the fully active state."
https://openalex.org/W1536886415,"Phosphorylation of the adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP) isolated from 3T3-L1 cells has been studied in vitro utilizing the wheat germ agglutinin-purified 3T3-L1 adipocyte insulin receptor and the soluble kinase domain of the human insulin receptor. Following insulin-stimulated, ATP-dependent autophosphorylation of the wheat germ agglutinin-purified receptor beta-subunit, ALBP was phosphorylated exclusively on tyrosine 19 in the sequence Glu-Asn-Phe-Asp-Asp-Tyr19, analogous to the substrate phosphorylation consensus sequence observed for several tyrosyl kinases. The concentration of insulin necessary for half-maximal receptor autophosphorylation (KIR0.5) was identical to that necessary for half-maximal ALBP phosphorylation (KALBP0.5), 10 nM. Kinetic analysis indicated that stimulation of ALBP phosphorylation by insulin was attributable to a 5-fold increase in the Vmax (to 0.33 fmol/min/fmol insulin-binding sites) while the Km for ALBP was largely unaffected. By utilizing the soluble kinase domain of the human receptor beta-subunit, the presence of oleate bound to ALBP increased the kcat/Km greater than 3-fold. Oleate dramatically inhibited autophosphorylation of the 38-kDa fragment of the soluble receptor kinase in a concentration dependent fashion (I0.5 approximately 4 microM). The 48-kDa kinase exhibited much less sensitivity to the effects of oleate (I0.5 approximately 190 microM). The inhibition of autophosphorylation of the 48-kDa soluble kinase by oleate was reversed by adding saturating levels of ALBP. These results demonstrate that in vitro the murine adipocyte lipid-binding protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine 19 in an insulin-stimulated fashion by the insulin receptor and that the presence of a bound fatty acid on ALBP increases the affinity of insulin receptor for ALBP. Inhibition of insulin receptor kinase activity by unbound fatty acids suggests that the end products of the lipogenic pathway may feedback inhibit the tyrosyl kinase and that fatty acid-binding proteins have the potential to modulate such interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1564323961,"Site-directed mutagenesis was used to explore the role of Lys-195 in ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from Escherichia coli. This residue, which is conserved in every bacterial and plant source sequenced to date, was originally identified as a potential catalytic site residue by covalent modification studies. Mutation of Lys-195 to glutamine produces an enzyme whose Km for glucose 1-phosphate is 600-fold greater than that measured for the wild-type enzyme. The effect on glucose 1-phosphate is very specific since kinetic constants measured for ATP, Mg2+, and the allosteric activator, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, are unchanged relative to those measured for the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, the catalytic rate constant, Kcat, for the glutamine mutant is similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. Taken together, the results suggest a role for Lys-195 in binding of glucose 1-phosphate and exclude its role as a participant in the rate-determining step(s) in the catalytic reaction mechanism. To further study the effect of charge, shape, size, and hydrophobicity of the amino acid residue at position 195, a series of mutants were prepared including arginine, histidine, isoleucine, and glutamic acid. In every case, the kinetic constants measured for ATP, Mg2+, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate were similar to wild-type constants, reinforcing the notion that this residue is responsible for a highly localized effect at the glucose 1-phosphate-binding site and also suggesting that the protein can accommodate a wide range of substitutions at this position without losing its global folding properties. Thermal stability measurements corroborate this finding. The mutations did, however, produce a range of glucose 1-phosphate Km values from 100- to 10,000-fold greater than wild-type, which indicate that both size and charge properties of lysine are essential for proper binding of glucose 1-phosphate at the catalytic site. AMP binding was also affected by the nature of the mutation at position 195. A model for glucose 1-phosphate, ATP, and AMP binding is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1595177880,"The presence of a soluble, truncated form of the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor in serum has suggested that cleavage from the cell surface may be an initial step in the degradation of this protein (MacDonald, R. G., Tepper, M. A., Clairmont, K. B., Perregaux, S. B., and Czech, M. P. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3256-3261). In order to test this hypothesis, we pulse-labeled cultured BRL-3A rat liver cells with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and measured the fate of labeled receptor at various times after incubation with unlabeled amino acids. It was found that the appearance of labeled IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor in the medium accounts quantitatively for the loss of labeled receptor from the BRL-3A cells. In similar experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells, L6 rat myoblasts, and chick embryo fibroblasts, labeled receptor from the cell membranes decreases with a time course corresponding to the appearance of soluble receptor in the medium. The release of labeled receptor into the medium can be blocked by the addition of the protease inhibitors aprotinin, chymostatin, or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, but not antipain, leupeptin, and benzamidine. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the degradation and loss of cellular IGF-II/Man-6-P receptors occurs by a nonlysosomal mechanism involving their proteolysis and removal into the extracellular fluid."

Dam topoisomerase III, like other bacterial type I topoisomerases, absolutely requires Mg2+ for activity and is specific for single-stranded DNA. At 60-80 degrees C, it relaxes negatively but not positively supercoiled DNA and is inhibited by single-stranded M13 DNA. At 95 degrees C, the enzyme unwinds both positively and negatively supercoiled substrates and produces extensively unwound form I* and I** DNA. The peculiarities of DNA topoisomerization at high temperatures are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1482523285,"Abstract The 20 S RNA genome is a circular single-stranded replicon, present in most laboratory yeast strains, whose copy number is induced 10,000-fold by transfer of cells to acetate medium without a carbon source. We have sequenced most of the 20 S RNA genome, and the (+) strand has a long open reading frame with the potential to encode a protein with homology to viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. The presence of a typical cAMP-dependent phosphorylation site in the putative RNA polymerase suggests that the acetate amplification of the 20 S RNA genome might be mediated by cAMP, a signal known to transmit the same nutritional status information to the sporulation-control system. Our inability to clone across the gap in the sequence suggests either autocatalytic cleavage of the RNA in the reverse transcriptase reaction, an unusual linkage of 5' and 3' ends of a fundamentally linear molecule, or a structure unusually resistant to reverse transcription. The identity of our sequence with that of the accompanying paper (Rodriguez-Cousino, N., Esteban, L.M., and Esteban, R. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 12772-12778) for W double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) suggests that W is the replicative form of 20 S RNA. The presence of single-stranded (+) and (-) strands and greater than unit length molecules suggests a rolling circle mode of replication as has been suggested for viroids."
https://openalex.org/W1514200453,"Protein C inhibitor (PCI), also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor 3, inhibits a variety of serine proteases by forming sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable 1:1 complexes. In purified systems PCI is only a weak inhibitor of urokinase. Nevertheless, complexes between PCI and urokinase are found in appreciable amounts in native human urine. Since PCI activity is stimulated by heparin and other glycosaminoglycans, we investigated the presence of stimulating glycosaminoglycans on cells lining the urinary tract. We chose the epithelial kidney tumor cell line TCL-598 as a model and isolated metabolically labeled glycosaminoglycans. TCL-598 incorporated [35S] sulfate into high Mr components (Mr greater than 200,000 and approximately 75,000) as judged from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of cell extracts; the Mr greater than 200,000 component bound specifically to PCI-Sepharose 4B and was eluted either with heparin (5 mg/ml) or with NaCl (2.0 M). Treatment of this PCI-binding material with chondroitinase ABC, but not with chondritinase AC or heparitinase, abolished binding to PCI-Sepharose, confirming the glycosaminoglycan nature of this material and suggesting the involvement of dermatan sulfate in binding. These glycosaminoglycans eluted from PCI-Sepharose stimulated urokinase inhibition by PCI in a dose-dependent way and enhanced complex formation of 125I-urokinase and PCI as did in control experiments dermatan sulfate from porcine skin and from bovine mucosa. Our results suggest that PCI activity might be regulated also in vivo by the presence or absence of stimulating glycosaminoglycans; dermatan sulfate-containing glycosaminoglycans associated with kidney cells might be responsible for stimulation of the urokinase inhibitory activity of PCI in the urinary tract; the type of glucosaminoclycans might furthermore regulate enzyme specificity of PCI."
https://openalex.org/W1631758165,"A chimeric receptor consisting of an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor ligand-binding domain and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor transmembrane and cytoplasmic signalling domains has been constructed and shown to be fully functional in phosphorylation, mitogenesis, transformation, Ca2+ release, and pH change assays. Expression of this receptor in EGF receptor-deficient, PDGF-responsive NIH 3T3 cells allows the activation of PDGF signalling pathways by EGF. This system was used to examine the function of kinase insertion sequences (KIS). While a mutant with a KIS deletion of 83 amino acids displayed a significant but reduced ability to induce mitogenic, transforming, and Ca2+ release responses in transfected cells, deletion of 20 additional amino acids resulted in abolishment of such activities. This differential loss of signalling potential correlated with the reduced or abolished potential of these receptor mutants to phosphorylate cellular substrates such as PLC gamma. Our results suggest an integral role for KIS in PDGF receptor cytoplasmic domain conformation and an involvement in substrate interaction, but provide no evidence for an exclusive role of KIS in the mediation of biological signals."
https://openalex.org/W1549909181,"Abstract We have characterized the biochemical activities of purified polyoma (Py) large T antigen (T Ag) that was capable of mediating the replication of a plasmid containing the Py origin (ori(+) DNA) in mouse cell extracts. We report here that like the T Ag encoded by simian virus 40 (SV40), Py T Ag has DNA helicase and double-stranded DNA fragment unwinding activities. Py T Ag displaced DNA fragments greater than 1,600 nucleotides which were annealed to complementary sequences in single-stranded M13 by translocating in the 3' to 5' direction. Both helicase and double-stranded DNA fragment unwinding reactions were completely dependent upon NTP hydrolysis, displaying a strong preference for ATP and dATP. At low T Ag concentrations, significantly more Py ori(+) DNA fragment was unwound compared with a fragment lacking the replication origin. However, at higher ratios of Py T Ag to DNA, equivalent to those used in replication reactions, unwinding of both ori-containing and -lacking fragments was equally efficient. This is in contrast to SV40 T Ag which exhibited a more stringent requirement for SV40 origin sequences under similar conditions. Furthermore, some of the nucleotides that supported the helicase and unwinding activities of Py T Ag were different from those for the same SV40 T Ag reactions. We have also observed that in contrast to the very poor replication of linear SV40 ori(+) DNA by SV40 T Ag in human cell extracts, linear Py ori(+) DNA was replicated efficiently in mouse cell extracts by Py T Ag. However, despite the fact that linear Py ori(+), SV40 ori(+), and ori(-) DNA fragments could be unwound with comparable efficiency by Py T Ag, only fragments containing the Py replication origin were replicated in vitro. These results suggest that the initiation of DNA synthesis at the Py origin of replication requires features in addition to unwinding of the template."
https://openalex.org/W1523199189,"Abstract The receptor-linked tyrosine phosphatase RPTP alpha from human brain (Kaplan, R., Morse, B., Huebner, K., Croce, C., Howk, R., Ravera, M., Ricca, G., Jaye, M., and Schlessinger, J. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 7000-7004) was expressed in insect cells following infection with recombinant baculovirus. Two major forms of the enzyme, with molecular sizes of 98 kDa and 114 kDa, were detected by immunoblot analysis. This heterogeneity could be ascribed to N-linked glycosylation on the basis of two lines of evidence; namely, blockage of glycosylation with tunicamycin in vivo and removal of carbohydrates by endoglycosidase F in vitro. The 114-kDa form was purified to homogeneity by chromatography on Superose 12 and Mono Q. Compared to the low Mr placenta and T-cell tyrosine phosphatases, RPTP alpha displayed a low optimum pH of 6 and a high Km in the micromolar range toward two artificial substrates (tyrosyl-phosphorylated myelin basic protein and modified lysozyme, respectively). Most effectors had a different and often an opposite influence on phosphatase activity depending on the nature of the substrate and the pH at which the assays were performed. Determination of Km and Vmax values for RPTP alpha suggests that the enzyme could exist in low and high substrate affinity states."
https://openalex.org/W1588028833,"The interactions of a novel fluorescent compound, 1-(2-methylphenyl)-4-methylamino-6-methyl-2,3-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c ]quinoline (MDPQ) with the gastric H,K-ATPase were determined. MDPQ was shown to inhibit the H,K-ATPase and its associated K(+)-phosphatase competitively with K+, with Ki values of 0.22 and 0.65 microM, respectively. It also inhibited H+ transport with an IC50 of 0.29 microM, but at a concentration of 3.5 microM, reduced the steady-state level of phosphoenzyme by only 28%. The fluorescence of the inhibitor increased upon binding to the enzyme. 70% of this increment was quenched by K+, independently of Mg2+. The binding of MgATP to a high affinity site (K0.5(ATP) less than 1 microM) markedly increased the fluorescence due to the formation of an inhibitor-phosphoenzyme complex saturating with a K0.5(MDPQ) of 0.94 microM. The K(+)-dependent fluorescent quench (K0.5(K+) = 1.8 mM) required the ionophore, nigericin, indicating that K+ and MDPQ were competing at an extracytosolic site on the enzyme. Formation also of an enzyme-vanadyl-inhibitor complex was shown by the fact that Mg2+ plus vanadate enhanced MDPQ fluorescence in the absence of MgATP and decreased fluorescence in the presence of MgATP. The minimal stoichiometry of bound MDPQ determined by fluorescence titrations in the presence of MgATP was 1.4 mol/mol phosphoenzyme. The data suggest that this compound can serve as a probe of conformation at an extracytosolic site of the H,K-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1559210409,"Galactose transport was studied in membrane vesicles, prepared by fusion of plasma membranes from the yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus with proteoliposomes containing beef heart cytochrome c oxidase as a proton-motive force-generating system. Sugar transport studies performed under nonenergized conditions revealed that, even at high protein to phospholipid ratios, not all vesicles contained a D-galactose-specific transporter. The amount of vesicles containing an active carrier proved to be proportional to the amount of plasma membrane protein present in the fusion mixture. By addition of a suitable electron donor system a proton-motive force of -160 mV could be generated, inside alkaline and negative. Moreover, D-galactose accumulation was observed. It was found that D-galactose accumulation was highly dependent on the phospholipid composition of the vesicles, whereas generation of a proton-motive force was not. Best results were obtained with vesicles prepared with Escherichia coli phospholipid, giving a galactose accumulation of 14 times. Uphill transport could be established under conditions where only the pH gradient or the electrical gradient was present. Moreover, kinetic analysis of the galactose transport activity in energized vesicles revealed influx with a Km value of 540 microM, which is in good agreement with the apparent affinity constant obtained with whole cells. These results establish that galactose transport of K. marxianus is a proton-motive force-driven process. Moreover it demonstrates that plasma membrane vesicles co-reconstituted with cytochrome c oxidase are a valuable resource for the analysis of proton-motive force-driven sugar transport systems of yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1503457623,"We have detected three unique apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) charge isoforms in strains of commensal mice. The cDNA sequences for one representative of each isoform (Mus domestesticus strains C57BL/6J and 129/J and Mus castaneus) revealed a polymorphism within a series of four imperfect repeats encoding the sequence Glu-Gln-Ala/Val-Gln. Insertions or deletions of 12 nucleotides within this repetitive region have given rise to three genotypes characterized by three (129), four (C57BL/6), or five (M. castaneus) copies of the repeat unit. To ascertain the extent of this variation among other species of the Mus genus, we sequenced this region of apoA-IV cDNAs from eight additional M. domesticus inbred strains and from five wild-derived Mus species. All eight additional M. domesticus strains examined had four repeat units, as found in C57BL/6. Among wild-derived mice, however, one species (Mus spretus) had three repeats, two species (Mus cookii and Mus cervicolor) had four repeats, and two species (Mus hortulanus and Mus minutoides) had five repeats. A lack of correlation between the number of repeat units and the phylogeny of Mus species indicates that independent mutations may have occurred throughout the evolution of specific mouse lineages. We suggest that the repetitive nature of the polymorphic sequence may predispose this region to slippage errors during DNA replication, resulting in frequent deletion/insertion mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1561857073,"Sequence-directed DNA curvature is most commonly associated with AA dinucleotides in the form of polyadenine runs. We demonstrate inherent curvature in DNA which lacks AA/TT dinucleotides using the criteria of polyacrylamide gel mobility and efficiency of DNA cyclization. These studies are based upon two 21-base pair synthetic DNA fragments designed to exhibit fixed curvature according to deflections made to the helical axis by non-AA dinucleotide stacks. Repeats of these sequences display anomalously slow migration in polyacrylamide gels. Moreover, both sequences describe helical conformations that are closed into circles by DNA ligase at much smaller sizes than is typical of nondeformed DNA. Chemical cleavage of these DNA molecules with hydroxyl radical is also consistent with local variation in helical conformation at specific dinucleotide steps."
https://openalex.org/W1547394170,"We have previously reported the genetic construction and properties of a fusion protein which was composed of the enzymatically active and membrane translocation domains of the diphtheria toxin and the receptor-specific ligand alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) (Murphy, J.R., Bishai, W., Borowski, M., Miyanohara, A., Boyd, J., and Nagle, S. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 8258-8262). While this fusion toxin was found to be selectively toxic for MSH receptor-bearing cells in vitro, it was subject to profound proteolytic degradation in recombinant Escherichia coli making purification difficult. We now report that the deletion of diphtheria toxin fragment B sequences between Thr387 and His485 results in a protease-resistant form of the fusion toxin, DAB389-alpha-MSH. We show that DAB389-alpha-MSH is expressed in high yield in recombinant Escherichia coli, that it is readily purified from crude bacterial lysates by immunoaffinity and high performance liquid chromatography, and its cytotoxic activity toward both human and murine malignant melanoma cell lines is mediated through the MSH receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1540767058,"RVGLVRGEKARKGK (peptide 14) from residues 2410-2423 of the human insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGF-IIR) directly activates adenylylcyclase-inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (Gi proteins) whereas RGEKARKGK (peptide 9) has no stimulatory action. However, peptide 9 inhibited the actions of peptide 14 on both GDP release from and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) binding to Gi-2 in an aqueous system. Peptide 9 also inhibited peptide 14-induced Gi-1 activation with a similar profile. The peptide 9 action was competitive for peptide 14 action and determined by the first arginine residue and the C-terminal RKGK. In reconstituted IGF-IIR-Gi-2 vesicles, peptide 9 blocked the G protein stimulation by IGF-II with a potency similar to that observed in the action of peptide 9 on peptide 14; and peptide 9-induced inhibition was also observed in IGF-IIR-Gi-1 vesicles. In pertussis toxin-treated K562 cell membranes supplemented with Gi-2, peptide 9 inhibited IGF-II-induced reduction in pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gi-2 with an IC50 of 30 microM. This inhibitory effect of peptide 9 was competitive for the concentration of these IGF-IIR-positive/IGF-I receptor-negative cell membranes. Therefore, peptide 9 inhibits the Gi-activating function of IGF-IIR possibly by interacting with the putative peptide 14 recognition site of Gi proteins. The significance of this sequence is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1579741030,"The chromium moiety of gamma,beta-bidentate CrATP slowly accepts a ligand from the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase to form an exchange inert coordination complex (k + 1 = 0.083 min-1; k - 2 = 0.003 min-1, 37 degrees C, 100 microM CaCl2). The stability of the Cr3+ coordinate bonds allowed the complex to be isolated by filtration techniques at neutral pH without acid precipitation. We found 4-5 nmol of [gamma-32P]CrATP to bind to 1 mg of sarcoplasmic reticulum protein with the subsequent occlusion of 7-8 nmol of 45Ca2+. At 37 degrees C, the CrATP.ATPase complex could be formed in the absence of Ca2+, although the reaction was 2-3 times slower than in the presence of Ca2+. Inhibition by Pi, by orthovanadate, and by fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate verified that the bound CrATP was at the catalytic site. The site of CrATP attachment was found to be on the A tryptic fragment, possibly on the A2 subfragment. It was determined that Ca2+ binding to high affinity sites on the enzyme controls the rate by which the Cr3+ moiety accepts the ligand from the enzyme. The rate of change in the EPR spectrum of iodoacetamide spin-labeled ATPase was shown to follow the rate of ligand acceptance, rather than the binding of Ca2+ and substrate per se. This particular change has been attributed to the formation of an activated complex that is immediately precursory to phosphorylation and indicates here that this complex cannot be properly formed until the metal has been chelated by the enzyme. It is concluded that control over metal chelation (Cr3+ here, Mg2+ in the normal mechanism) is one means by which Ca2+ activates the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1583573785,"Abstract In the amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, endocytic vacuoles are acidified by proton pumps which reside not in their membranes but in an associated organelle which we call the acidosome. These two organelles can be dissociated in vitro, and we now describe conditions for their functional reassociation. Fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-dextran was fed to amoebae to report on the pH of their endocytic vacuoles. Following homogenization, the endocytic vacuoles were dissociated from acidosomes by removing Mg2+ and cytosol and purged of their native acidity by transient exposure to nigericin. The endocytic vacuoles could then be reacidified by ATP if first preincubated under these optimized conditions: 30 degrees C for 30 min in the presence of acidosomes, a 4-fold excess of cytosol, and 5 mM Mg2+ at pH 7.4. Reacidification was observed with early but not late endocytic compartments. Mn2+ and Ca2+ were poor substitutes for Mg2+; albumin did not substitute for cytosol. Neither Ca2+, ATP, nor adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) affected reconstitution appreciably; guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) inhibited reacidification by 50% when present during preincubation at 0.1 mM. Warming the cytosol to 50 degrees C or exposing it to protease abolished its activity but N-ethylmaleimide did not. Molecular sieving indicated that the cytosolic factor was a macromolecule. We conclude that the specific functional association of acidosomes and endocytic vacuoles can be reconstituted in vitro with soluble proteins plus Mg2+."

The resulting hybridomas were screened for anti-idiotypic antibody (anti-anti-PAF) with F(ab')2 fragments of affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-PAF antibody. These antibodies displayed internal image properties of PAF and were considered as Ab2 beta according to the following criteria: (a) they bound to F(ab')2 fragments of the affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-PAF antibody that had high affinity for PAF; (b) they inhibited [3H]PAF binding to rabbit polyclonal anti-PAF antibody and its F(ab')2 fragment in a concentration-dependent manner; (c) they displaced [3H]PAF from the anti-PAF antibody/[3H]PAF complex specifically; (d) they inhibited [3H]PAF binding to PAF receptors on rabbit platelet membranes dose dependently; (e) they displaced [3H]PAF from the [3H]PAF/PAF receptor complex specifically; and (f) they stimulated rabbit platelets to aggregate, and this aggregation could be inhibited or totally blocked by specific PAF receptor antagonists WEB 2086 and SRI 63-441. All of the above are consistent with the first successful production of monoclonal antibodies that mimic PAF and interact specifically with the PAF binding domain of PAF receptors on rabbit platelet membranes."

At pH 7.5 and 15 degrees C, the equilibrium constant for the central complex K'eq = [E.Fru-6-P.Pi]/[E.Fru-1,6-P2.H2O] is about 2. This observation is in harmony with results obtained with a number of Bi Bi enzyme systems for the determination of K'eq in which a variety of experimental techniques were used (Knowles, J.R. (1980) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 49, 877-919). Significant changes in 31P NMR chemical shifts were observed for both the substrate, Fru-1,6-P2, and the product, Fru-6-P, when bound to the enzyme relative to ligand free in solution. The chemical shifts of the substrate and product were altered further in the presence of Mg2+, the catalytic divalent metal ion. The chemical shifts caused by the addition of metal ion can be reversed in the presence of trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane- N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (CDTA) or AMP. In the presence of the metal ion chelator or the nucleotide, the substrate had a chemical shift that was about the same as that observed in the absence of metal ion. On the basis of these observations we suggest that AMP and CDTA exhibit similar effects, i.e. they both remove the catalytic metal ion from the enzyme. This finding is supportive of the suggestion (Scheffler, J. E., and Fromm, H.J. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 6659-6665; Liu, F., and Fromm, H.J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7401-7406) that the role of AMP in the regulation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is to prevent binding of the divalent metal activator to the enzyme."

In the present study, we have utilized 1H NMR to compare the order and rate of mono- and diphosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues in a series of synthetic dodecapeptide substrates (based on the receptor sequence, which includes major sites of autophosphorylation (RRDIYETDYYRK), with substitution(s) at positions 6 and/or 7 based on residue size and/or charge) by the approximately 48-kDa enzyme and by a approximately 38-kDa enzyme generated by tryptic deletion of approximately 10 kDa from the carboxyl terminus of the approximately 48-kDa protein. Both enzymes exhibit a marked order and progression of phosphorylation of peptide tyrosine residues; for each peptide, phosphorylation initiates and proceeds to completion first on tyrosine 9, followed by phosphorylation on tyrosine 10. Although removal of the carboxyl terminus does not affect the rate of monophosphorylation of these peptides on tyrosine 9, the smaller enzyme exhibits a slower rate of diphosphorylation (at tyrosine 10), as compared with the approximately 48-kDa enzyme."
