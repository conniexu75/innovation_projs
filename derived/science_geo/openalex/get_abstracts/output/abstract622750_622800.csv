https://openalex.org/W2903178500,"Introduction 
The literature suggests that 6–12% of practicing physicians are dyscompetent. Dyscompetence can manifest as failures in direct provision of care, but also issues with interpersonal and communications skills and professionalism. There is a growing literature suggesting the value of neurocognitive screening in physicians with clinical competency issues. The contribution of such screening in physicians with workplace behavioral issues is not as established. The aim of this exploratory study was to examine patterns of performance on a commonly used neuropsychological screening instrument. Performances differences, if present, could have implications for remediation and/or monitoring.


Methods 
Published data on a computerized neurocognitive screening instrument (MicroCog) for normative physician samples, published data on physicians referred for clinical competency issues, and newly collected data on physicians with workplace behavioral issues were analyzed. A two-way analysis of variance (Sample X Index) and post-hoc paired comparisons were conducted. A second analysis was performed employing an aggregated estimate of normative physician performance.


Results 
Results revealed a significant main effect for Sample and Index and a significant interaction effect. The second analysis of variance employing the pooled samples (Sample X Index) was conducted. The workplace behavior issues sample differed significantly from each of the samples. The Sample by Index interaction was significant.


Discussion 
Significant differences in performance on a neurocognitive screening instrument were found between non-referred physicians and physicians with behavioral or medical/technical competency concerns. Those with workplace behavioral issues performed significantly better than those with medical/technical issues, but significantly worse than non-referred physicians. Using these findings, 2.0% of the normal sample versus 35.1% of the medical/technical sample, and 10.9% of the behavioral sample would fail the screen using typical, conservative cutoffs. Further study of the potential role of neurocognitive factors in physicians referred for behavioral comportment issues is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2902574930,"Irrigation water is a major source of fresh produce contamination with undesired microorganisms including antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and contaminated fresh produce can transfer ARB to the consumer especially when consumed raw. Nevertheless, no legal guidelines exist so far regulating quality of irrigation water with respect to ARB. We therefore examined irrigation water from major vegetable growing areas for occurrence of antibiotic-resistant indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp., including extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. Occurrence of ARB strains was compared to total numbers of the respective species. We categorized water samples according to total numbers and found that categories with higher total E. coli or Enterococcus spp. numbers generally had an increased proportion of respective ARB-positive samples. We further detected high prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli with eight positive samples of thirty-six (22%), while two presumptive vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were vancomycin-susceptible in confirmatory tests. In disk diffusion assays all ESBL-producing E. coli were multidrug-resistant (n = 21) and whole-genome sequencing of selected strains revealed a multitude of transmissible resistance genes (ARG), with blaCTX-M-1 (4 of 11) and blaCTX-M-15 (3 of 11) as the most frequent ESBL genes. Overall, the increased occurrence of indicator ARB with increased total indicator bacteria suggests that the latter might be a suitable estimate for presence of respective ARB strains. Finally, the high prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli with transmissible ARG emphasizes the need to establish legal critical values and monitoring guidelines for ARB in irrigation water."
https://openalex.org/W2902206667,"Background Diarrhoea and malnutrition are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children in areas with poor access to clean water, improved sanitation, and with low socioeconomic status. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of diarrhoea, malnutrition and risk factors among children aged 6–59 months in the Tigray Region of Northern Ethiopia. Methods A community based cross-sectional study design was conducted from June to August 2017 to assess the magnitude and factors associated with diarrhoea and malnutrition among children. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect data on diarrhoea, environmental, demographic and behavioural factors from 610 mother-child pairs. Anthropometric measurements were collected from the children. SPSS ver.21 statistical software was used for analysis. Factors associated with diarrhoea and nutritional status were identified using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. A p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of the 610 children monitored in this study, the incidence of diarrhoea among 6–59 month-old children in the two weeks preceding the day of the interview day was 27.2% (95% CI: 23.6–31%). Specifically, 35.9%, 9.7%, and 1.8% had 1–2, 3–4 and 5–6 times of diarrhoea episodes in a one year of time, respectively. The prevalence of stunting, underweight, wasting, and acute under-nutrition were 36.1% (95% CI: 31–38.6%), 37% (95% CI: 32–39.6%), 7.9% (95% CI: 5.5–9.7%), and 5.4% (95% CI: 3.8–7.4%), respectively. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, type of drinking water source [AOR = 3.69; 95% CI: 2.03–6.71], mothers not hand washing at critical times [AOR = 15.42; 95% CI: 2.02–117.78], improper solid waste disposal [AOR = 12.81; 95% CI: 2.50–65.62], and child age (36–47 months) [AOR = 2.57; 95% CI: 1.45–4.55] were found to be predictors of diarrhoea. Being within the age range of 12–23 months was a predictor for wasting [AOR = 4.38; 95% CI: 1.61–11.90] and being underweight [AOR = 4.4; 95% CI: 1.7–11.2]. Similarly, the age range of 36–47 months was associated with wasting [AOR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.45–3.85] and stunting [AOR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.03–2.67]. Family size (less than 4) [AOR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.368–0.959] was inversely associated for wasting. Conclusions Our study revealed that the problem of diarrhoea and malnutrition amongst 6–59 months children in the study area was significant. Access to clean water was the main problem in the study area. Hence, improving access to clean water and providing health education to mothers on personal and environmental hygiene, and proper waste disposal could improve diarrhoea in the study area. Intervention on children’s nutrition should also be implemented to minimize the problem of malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2902785604,"The elevated plus maze (EPM) is routinely used in neuroscience research to evaluate emotional behavior in rodents by measuring general exploratory performance and avoidance of the aversive open arms of the maze. According to standard practice, behavior on the EPM is evaluated during a single trial to avoid the possibility of habituation to the apparatus that would result in lost sensitivity of key outcome measures. However, this possibility has not been systematically evaluated across repeated trials or across different environmental conditions. In the current study, we assessed within-subject behavior on the EPM in adult male rats over thirteen trials (tested twice weekly) repeated under identical conditions. We also assessed within-subject behavior on the EPM in adult male rats under dim (1 lux in the closed arm) and lit (246 lux in the closed arm) environmental conditions. We found that measures of general performance (basic movements and total distanced travelled throughout the maze) were stable across repeated trials and environmental conditions. We found that measures of open arm avoidance (distance travelled in, time spent in and entries in to the open arm) varied across trials and environmental conditions and were sensitive to the lighting conditions of the initial test. Though measures of open arm avoidance did show a linear trend indicative of habituation across repeated trials, this effect was variable across trials. Notably, preference for the open arm over the closed arm (measured as % of time spent in the open arm) assessed among individual animals occurred rarely and was never observed on the group level across the thirteen repeated trials. Together, these data demonstrate that measures of general performance such as basic movements and total distance traveled are robust to repeated testing and changing environmental lighting conditions. In contrast, measures of open arm avoidance show habituation with repeated testing and are sensitive to changing environmental lighting conditions. Based on these results, we suggest that within-subjects repeated testing on the EPM is valid in well-controlled studies that include an untreated control group to account for inter-trial variability and habituation."
https://openalex.org/W2902312774,"Knowledge of marine ecosystems that grow and reside on and around subsea oil and gas infrastructure is required to understand impacts of this offshore industry on the marine environment and inform decommissioning decisions. This study used baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) to compare species richness, fish abundance and size along 42.3 km of subsea pipeline and in adjacent areas of varying habitats. The pipeline is laid in an onshore-offshore direction enabling surveys to encompass a range of depths from 9 m nearshore out to 140 m depth offshore. Surveys off the pipeline were performed across this depth range and in an array of natural habitats (sand, macroalgae, coral reef) between 1 km and 40 km distance from the pipeline. A total of 14,953 fish were observed comprising 240 species (131 on the pipeline and 225 off-pipeline) and 59 families (39 on the pipeline and 56 off-pipeline) and the length of 8,610 fish were measured. The fish assemblage on and off the pipeline was similar in depths of <80 m. In depths beyond 80 m, the predominant habitat off-pipeline was sand and differences between fish assemblages on and off-pipeline were more pronounced. The pipeline was characterised by higher biomass and abundances of larger-bodied, commercially important species such as: Pristipomoides multidens (goldband snapper), Lutjanus malabaricus (saddletail snapper) and Lutjanus russellii (Moses' snapper) among others, and possessed a catch value 2-3 times higher per stereo-BRUV deployment than that of fish observed off-pipeline. Adjacent natural seabed habitats possessed higher abundances of Atule mate (yellowtail scad), Nemipterus spp. (threadfin bream) and Terapon jarbua (crescent grunter), species of no or low commercial value. This is the first published study to use stereo-BRUVs to report on the importance of subsea infrastructure to commercially important fishes over a depth gradient and increases our knowledge of the fish assemblage associated with subsea infrastructure off north-west Australia. These results provide a greater understanding of ecological and fisheries implications of decommissioning subsea infrastructure on the north-west shelf, and will help better inform decision-making on the fate of infrastructure at different depths."
https://openalex.org/W2903449363,"Big data classification is very slow when using traditional machine learning classifiers, particularly when using a lazy and slow-by-nature classifier such as the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN). This paper proposes a new approach which is based on sorting the feature vectors of training data in a binary search tree to accelerate big data classification using the KNN approach. This is done using two methods, both of which utilize two local points to sort the examples based on their similarity to these local points. The first method chooses the local points based on their similarity to the global extreme points, while the second method chooses the local points randomly. The results of various experiments conducted on different big datasets show reasonable accuracy rates compared to state-of-the-art methods and the KNN classifier itself. More importantly, they show the high classification speed of both methods. This strong trait can be used to further improve the accuracy of the proposed methods."
https://openalex.org/W2903819517,"Mycobacterial efflux pumps play a major role in the emergence of antimycobacterial drug resistance. Of particular interest is the proteinaceous multi-drug efflux pump protein Rv1258c that encodes a tetracycline/aminoglycoside resistance (TAP-2)-like efflux pump which is active in susceptible and drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Rv1258c is implicated in drug resistance to numerous antimycobacterials including first line drugs rifampicin and isoniazid as well as fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotic classes. To date, compounds like verapamil and piperine have been shown to inhibit Rv1258c but no direct evidence for binding or mode of action exist. Therefore in the present study we generated an accurate 3D model of Rv1258c using MODELLER and validated its structure using molecular dynamic simulation studies with GROMACS software. The 3D-structures of Rv1258c and the homologous template 1pw4 were simulated within a POPE/POPG lipid bilayer and found to behave similar. Another important finding was the identification of one local energy minima state of the apo protein, which speaks to the flexibility of the protein and will be investigated further. Extraction of one of the open channel conformations of Rv1258c and blind docking of various structurally diverse putative inhibitors and substrates, allowed for the identification of a probable binding site. Spectinamide was found to bind to a different location on the outside surface of the protein suggesting its ability to avoid the efflux channel. We further identified 246 putative compounds that showed higher binding affinity values to Rv1258c compared to piperine and verapamil. Interaction analysis of the top 20 purchasable compounds identified crucial hydrogen bond interactions with Ser26, Ser45 and Glu243 as well as a pi-pi stacking interaction with Trp32 that accounted for the strong affinity of these compounds for Rv1258c. Future studies will entail purchasing a number of compounds for in vitro activity testing against Mycobacterium tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2902949951,"Purpose To present a novel non-parametric algorithm for detecting the position of the human eye limbus in three dimensions and a new dynamic method for measuring the full 360° visible iris boundary known as white-to-white distance along the eye horizontal line. Methods The study included 88 participants aged 23 to 65 years (37.7±9.7), 47 females and 41 males. Clinical characteristics, height data and the apex coordinates and 1024×1280 pixel digital images of the eyes were taken by an Eye Surface Profiler and processed by custom-built MATLAB codes. A dynamic light intensity frequency based white-to-white detection process and a novel three-dimensional method for limbus detection is presented. Results Evidence of significant differences (p<0.001) between nasal-temporal and superior-inferior white-to-white distances in both right and left eyes were found (nasal-temporal direction; 11.74±0.42 mm in right eyes and 11.82±0.47 mm in left eyes & superior-inferior direction; 11.52±0.45 mm in right eyes and 11.55±0.46 mm in left eyes). Average limbus nasal-temporal diameters were 13.64±0.55 mm for right eyes, and 13.74±0.40 mm for left eyes, however the superior-inferior diameters were 13.65±0.54 mm, 13.75±0.38 mm for right and left eyes, respectively. No significant difference in limbus contours has been observed either between the nasal-temporal direction (p = 0.91) and the superior-inferior direction (p = 0.83) or between the right (p = 0.18) and left eyes (p = 0.16). Evidence of tilt towards the nasal-temporal side in the three-dimensional shape of the limbus was found. The right eyes mean limbus contour tilt around the X-axis was -0.3±1.35° however, their mean limbus contour tilt around the Y-axis was 1.76±0.9°. Likewise, the left eyes mean limbus contour tilt around the X-axis was 0.77±1.25° and the mean limbus contour tilt around the Y-axis was -1.54±0.89°. Conclusions The white-to-white distance in the human eye is significantly larger in the nasal-temporal direction than in the superior-inferior direction. The human limbus diameter was found not to vary significantly in these directions. The 3D measures show that the limbus contour does not lay in one plane and tends to be higher on the nasal-inferior side of the eye."
https://openalex.org/W2903439841,"The macrozoobenthic diversity patterns along a brackish–freshwater salinity gradient have been identified, considering effects of differences in the level of hydrological connection of coastal lakes with the sea on the structure of benthic invertebrate communities. The study is based on samples from six coastal lakes located along the southern coast of the Baltic Sea in Poland. The analysis of environmental and biological data confirmed the existence of stable phases (brackish water vs. freshwater), but as a result of periodical intrusion of seawater, adaptation of animal communities takes place, which was reflected in low values of the predictors describing them (number of taxa, density and diversity). Redundancy analysis indicates that values of conductivity and salinity are the major factors that determine the abundance of dominant groups of benthic fauna. The gradient of hydrological connection of the lakes with the sea accounted for 50% of the variance in biological data, physico-chemical variables for 25%, trophic variables for 15%, and only 9% of the variance was unexplained. The major implication of our results is that coastal lakes that differ only slightly in salinity can have alternative, regional patterns of diversity of structure of benthic fauna. Periodical inflow of brackish waters initiates adaptive cycles of benthic fauna, and their frequency is strongly linked with the hydrological regime. The rhythm of the inflow of seawater is variable, so that management and protection of coastal lakes are extremely complicated."
https://openalex.org/W2950898206,"Introduction Language impairment is recognized as as part of the delirium syndrome, yet there is little neuropsychological research on the nature of this dysfunction. Here we hypothesized that patients with delirium show impairments in language formation, coherence and comprehension. Methods This was a case-control study in 45 hospitalized patients (aged 65–97 years) with delirium, dementia without delirium, or no cognitive impairment (N = 15 per group). DSM-5 criteria were used for delirium. Speech was elicited during (1) structured conversational questioning, and (2) the ""Cookie Theft"" picture description task. Language comprehension was assessed through standardized verbal and written commands. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Results Delirium and dementia groups scored lower on the conversational assessment than the control group (p<0.01, moderate effect sizes (r) of 0.48 and 0.51, resp.). In the Cookie Theft task, the average length of utterances (i.e. unit of speech), indicating language productivity and fluency, distinguished patients with delirium from those with dementia (p<0.01, r = 0.50) and no cognitive impairment (p<0.01, r = 0.55). Patients with delirium performed worse on written comprehension tests compared to cognitively unimpaired patients (p<0.01, r = 0.63), but not compared to the dementia group. Conclusions Production of spontaneous speech, word quantity, speech content and verbal and written language comprehension are impaired in delirious patients compared to cognitively unimpaired patients. Additionally, patients with delirium produced significantly less fluent speech than those with dementia. These findings have implications for how speech and language are evaluated in delirium assessments, and also for communication with patients with delirium. A study limitation was that the delirium group included patients with co-morbid dementia, which precludes drawing conclusions about the specific language profile of delirium."
https://openalex.org/W2903455828,"Respiratory disease caused by Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae and Pasteurellaceae poses a formidable challenge for bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) conservation. All-age epizootics can cause 10–90% mortality and are typically followed by multiple years of enzootic disease in lambs that hinders post-epizootic recovery of populations. The relative frequencies at which these epizootics are caused by the introduction of novel pathogens or expression of historic pathogens that have become resident in the populations is unknown. Our primary objectives were to determine how commonly the pathogens associated with respiratory disease are hosted by bighorn sheep populations and assess demographic characteristics of populations with respect to the presence of different pathogens. We sampled 22 bighorn sheep populations across Montana and Wyoming, USA for Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae and Pasteurellaceae and used data from management agencies to characterize the disease history and demographics of these populations. We tested for associations between lamb:ewe ratios and the presence of different respiratory pathogen species. All study populations hosted Pasteurellaceae and 17 (77%) hosted Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae. Average lamb:ewe ratios for individual populations where both Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae and Pasteurellaceae were detected ranged from 0.14 to 0.40. However, average lamb:ewe ratios were higher in populations where Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae was not detected (0.37, 95% CI: 0.27–0.51) than in populations where it was detected (0.25, 95% CI: 0.21–0.30). These findings suggest that respiratory pathogens are commonly hosted by bighorn sheep populations and often reduce recruitment rates; however ecological factors may interact with the pathogens to determine population-level effects. Elucidation of such factors could provide insights for management approaches that alleviate the effects of respiratory pathogens in bighorn sheep. Nevertheless, minimizing the introduction of novel pathogens from domestic sheep and goats remains imperative to bighorn sheep conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2902221519,"Object This study aimed to analyze the association between low handgrip strength (HGS) and low back pain (LBP) according to physical activity (PA) in the general population aged over 50 years. Methods Nationwide health surveys and examinations were performed in a cross-sectional representative of the Korean general population (n = 7,550 in 2014, n = 7,380 in 2015). Chronic LBP status was determined by self-reported survey responses with respect to the occurrence of LBP for more than 30 days during the previous 3 months. Maximal HGS was determined as the maximal strength of the dominant hand, and low HGS was defined as measurement in the lower 20th percentile of HGS measurements for the general population. High PA was defined as muscle-strengthening exercise for at least 3 days within 1 week. Demographics, medical history, and other variables were used to analyze adjusted weighted logistic regression models with propensity score matching. After propensity score matching, 429 participants were included in each group. Results Analysis was confined to those aged 50–89 years who responded to the chronic LBP survey and had no missing data on HGS. Low HGS and LBP showed significant association in the crude logistic regression model. In the multiple logistic regression model, after adjusting for confounding factors, low HGS was significantly associated with LBP in women with low PA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.75, p = 0.047). In the logistic regression model after propensity score matching, low HGS was also significantly related to LBP in women with low PA (aOR: 3.12, p = 0.004). Conclusions Our study showed the relationship between low HGS and LBP using a cross-sectional Korean population-based health survey. Low HGS in women aged over 50 years with low PA was significantly associated with the presence of LBP."
https://openalex.org/W2903050571,"Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a clinically distinct category of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection that needs to be diagnosed at the initial stage. We have reported earlier that one of the Mtb proline-proline-glutamic acid (PPE) proteins, PPE17 (Rv1168c) is associated with stronger B-cell and T-cell responses and could be used to diagnose different clinical categories of active TB patients with higher specificity and sensitivity than PPD and ESAT-6. Based on these observations we further tested the potential of PPE17 for the diagnosis of LTBI. We tested 198 sera samples collected from LTBI individuals (n = 61), QFT-negative (n = 58) and active TB patients (n = 79). Individuals were defined as LTBI by QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT) positive results, while active TB patients were confirmed based on the guidelines of the Revised National TB Control Programme of India. The antibody responses against PPE17, ESAT-6:CFP-10 and PPD were compared in these subjects by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We observed that LTBI individuals show a higher sero-reactivity to PPE17 as compared to currently used latent TB diagnostic antigens like ESAT-6, CFP-10 and PPD. The LTBI and active TB patients display almost similar sensitivity. Interestingly, PPE17 could discriminate LTBI positive subjects from the QFT-negative subjects (P < 0.001). Our study hints that PPE17 may be used as a novel serodiagnostic marker to screen the latently infected subjects and may also be used as a complimentary tool to the QFT-GIT."
https://openalex.org/W2903405120,"Surveillance of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is partly based on the sanitary inspection of carcasses at the abattoir to detect bTB-like lesions which, in compliance with EU recommendations, are analysed by bacteriology and histopathology to disclose Mycobacterium bovis (or M. caprae) infection. Moreover, since 2012, a PCR method with similar sensitivity and specificity values of histopathology and bacteriology respectively is additionally employed in France, partially compensating for the weaknesses of classical diagnostic methods. We analysed a collection of bTB-like lesions from cattle presenting positive histological results albeit with negative PCR results. We present here the results of these samples, recovered from 292 animals culled between 2013 and 2016, analysed with a second line molecular diagnosis approach that consists in a combination of PCRs targeting the M. tuberculosis-M. avium complexes as well as the Mycobacterium genus and sequencing of hsp65 gene. These molecular analyses disclosed to identify the presence of non-tuberculous bacteria which could be responsible for most of these non-specific TB lesions: non tuberculous mycobacteria (24%) or Actinomycetales (56%) such as Rhodococcus equi (53%); 24% of the samples were negative. M. bovis -or any other MTBC members- was neither detected by molecular methods nor isolated in any of them at the end of the 3 months of culture. In conclusion, these results highlight the lack of specificity of histopathology and the usefulness of a first line PCR with a second line molecular diagnostic test to circumvent it. This diagnostic strategy makes it possible to reduce the number of suspect bTB cases raised at the abattoir or shortening their lock-up periods. By simplifying diagnostic schemes, the use of this tool could improve bTB surveillance and make eradication programs more efficient in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2898627863,"Intracellular transport of organelles is fundamental to cell function and health. The mounting evidence suggests that this transport is in fact anomalous. However, the reasons for the anomaly is still under debate. We examined experimental trajectories of organelles inside a living cell and propose a mathematical model that describes the previously reported transition from sub-diffusive to super-diffusive motion. In order to explain super-diffusive behaviour at long times, we introduce non-Markovian detachment kinetics of the cargo: the rate of detachment is inversely proportional to the time since the last attachment. Recently, we observed the non-Markovian detachment rate experimentally in eukaryotic cells. Here we further discuss different scenarios of how this effective non-Markovian detachment rate could arise. The non-Markovian model is successful in simultaneously describing the time averaged variance (the time averaged mean squared displacement corrected for directed motion), the mean first passage time of trajectories and the multiple peaks observed in the distributions of cargo velocities. We argue that non-Markovian kinetics could be biologically beneficial compared to the Markovian kinetics commonly used for modelling, by increasing the average distance the cargoes travel when a microtubule is blocked by other filaments. In turn, sub-diffusion allows cargoes to reach neighbouring filaments with higher probability, which promotes active motion along the microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W2902236752,"Recently, a number of analytical approaches for probing medical databases have been developed to assist in disease risk assessment and to determine the association of a clinical condition with others, so that better and intelligent healthcare can be provided. The early assessment of disease risk is an emerging topic in medical informatics. If diseases are detected at an early stage, prognosis can be improved and medical resources can be used more efficiently. For example, if rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is detected at an early stage, appropriate medications can be used to prevent bone deterioration. In early disease risk assessment, finding important risk factors from large-scale medical databases and performing individual disease risk assessment have been challenging tasks. A number of recent studies have considered risk factor analysis approaches, such as association rule mining, sequential rule mining, regression, and expert advice. In this study, to improve disease risk assessment, machine learning and matrix factorization techniques were integrated to discover important and implicit risk factors. A novel framework is proposed that can effectively assess early disease risks, and RA is used as a case study. This framework comprises three main stages: data preprocessing, risk factor optimization, and early disease risk assessment. This is the first study integrating matrix factorization and machine learning for disease risk assessment that is applied to a nation-wide and longitudinal medical diagnostic database. In the experimental evaluations, a cohort established from a large-scale medical database was used that included 1007 RA-diagnosed patients and 921,192 control patients examined over a nine-year follow-up period (2000–2008). The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is more efficient and stable for disease risk assessment than state-of-the-art methods."
https://openalex.org/W2902980679,"Slackline training is a challenging and motivating type of balance training, with potential usefulness for fall prevention and balance rehabilitation. However, short-term slackline training seems to elicit mostly task-specific performance improvements, reducing its potential for general fall prevention programs. It was tested whether a longer duration slackline training (three months, 2 sessions per week) would induce a transfer to untrained tasks. Balance performance was tested pre and post slackline training on the slackline used during the training, on a slackline with different slack, and in 5 different non-trained static and dynamic balance tasks (N training = 12, N control = 14). After the training, the training group increased their performance more than the control group in both of the slackline tasks, i.e. walking on the slackline (time × group interaction with p < 0.001 for both tasks). However, no differences between groups were found for the 5 non-trained balance tasks, only a main effect of time for four of them. The long-term slackline training elicited large task-specific performance improvements but no transfer to other non-trained balance tasks. The extensive slackline training that clearly enhanced slackline performance did not improve the capability to keep balance in other tasks and thus cannot be recommended as a general fall prevention program. The significant test-retest effect seen in most of the tested tasks emphasizes the need of a control group to adequately interpret changes in performance following balance training."
https://openalex.org/W2902479175,"Seasonal variations affect the health system's functioning, including tuberculosis (TB) services, but there is little evidence about seasonal variations in TB case notification in tropical countries, including Ethiopia. This study sought to fill this gap in knowledge using TB data reported from 10 zones, 5 each from Amhara and Oromia regions.Notified TB cases for 2010-2016 were analyzed using SPSS version 20. We calculated the quarterly and annual average TB case notification rates and the proportion of seasonal amplitudes. We applied Winters' multiplicative method of exponential smoothing to break down the original time series into seasonal, trend, and irregular components and to build a suitable model for forecasting.A total of 205,575 TB cases were identified (47.8% from Amhara, 52.2% from Oromia), with a male-to-female ratio of 1.2:1. The means of 8,200 (24%), 7,992 (23%), 8,849 (26%), and 9,222 (27%) TB cases were reported during July-September, October-December, January-March, and April-June, respectively. The seasonal component of our model indicated a peak in April-June and a trough in October-December. The seasonal amplitude in Amhara region is 10% greater than that of Oromia (p < 0.05).TB is shown to be a seasonal disease in Ethiopia, with a peak in quarter four and a low in quarter two of the fiscal year. The peak TB case notification rate corresponds with the end of the dry season in the two agrarian regions of Ethiopia. TB prevention and control interventions, such as efforts to increase community TB awareness about TB transmission and contact tracing, should consider seasonal variation. Regional variations in TB seasonality may require consideration of geographic-specific TB case-finding strategies. The mechanisms underlying the seasonal variation of TB are complex, and further study is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2902502126,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a naturally-occurring, fecally transmitted disease caused by a Hantavirus (HV). It is extremely damaging to human health and results in many deaths annually, especially in Hubei Province, China. One of the primary characteristics of HFRS is the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of its occurrence, with notable seasonal differences. In view of this heterogeneity, the present study suggests that there is a need to focus on trend simulation and the spatiotemporal prediction of HFRS outbreaks. To facilitate this, we constructed a new Seasonal Difference Space-Time Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SD-STARIMA) model. The SD-STARIMA model is based on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the Space-Time Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (STARMA) model first developed by Cliff and Ord in 1974, which has proven useful in modelling the temporal aspects of spatially located data. This model can simulate the trends in HFRS epidemics, taking into consideration both spatial and temporal variations. The SD-STARIMA model is also able to make seasonal difference calculations to eliminate temporally non-stationary problems that are present in the HFRS data. Experiments have demonstrated that the proposed SD-STARIMA model offers notably better prediction accuracy, especially for spatiotemporal series data with seasonal distribution characteristics."

With the introduction of digital algorithms based on the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), we are interested to understand if the adherence to the guidelines improved for a better quality of care for children under 5 years old. Methods More than one year after the introduction of digital algorithms, we carried out two cross sectional studies to assess the improvements in comparison with the situation prior to the implementation of the project, in two Basic Health Centres in Kabul province. One survey was carried out inside the consultation room and was based on the direct observation of 181 consultations of children aged 2 months to 5 years old, using a checklist completed by a senior physicians. The second survey queried 181 caretakers of children outside the health facility for their opinion about the consultation carried out through the tablet and prescriptions and medications given. Results We measured the quality of care as adherence to the IMCI’s guidelines. The study evaluated the quality of the physical examination and the therapies prescribed with a special attention to antibiotic prescription. We noticed a dramatic improvement (p<0.05) of several indicators following the introduction of digital algorithms. The baseline physical examination was appropriate only for 23.8% [IC% 19.9–28.1] of the patients, 34.5% [IC% 30.0–39.2] received a correct treatment and 86.1% [IC% 82.4–89.2] received at least one antibiotic. With the introduction of digital algorithms, these indicators statistically improved respectively to 84.0% [IC% 77.9–88.6], >85% and less than 30%. Conclusions Our findings suggest that digital algorithms improve quality of care by applying the guidelines more effectively. Our experience should encourage to test this tool in different settings and to scale up its use at province/state level."
https://openalex.org/W2902196491,"Background Distal flap necrosis is a frequent complication of perforator flaps. Advances in nanotechnology offer exciting new therapeutic approaches. Anti-inflammatory and neo-angiogenic properties of certain metal oxides within the nanoparticles, including bioglass and ceria, may promote flap survival. Here, we explore the ability of various nanoparticle formulations to increase flap survival in a rat model. Materials and methods A 9 x 3 cm dorsal flap based on the posterior thigh perforator was raised in 32 Lewis rats. They were divided in 4 groups and treated with different nanoparticle suspensions: I–saline (control), II–Bioglass, III–Bioglass/ceria and IV–Zinc-doped strontium-substituted bioglass/ceria. On post-operative day 7, planimetry and laser Doppler analysis were performed to assess flap survival and various samples were collected to investigate angiogenesis, inflammation and toxicity. Results All nanoparticle-treated groups showed a larger flap survival area as compared to the control group (69.9%), with groups IV (77,3%) and II (76%) achieving statistical significance. Blood flow measurements by laser Doppler analysis showed higher perfusion in the nanoparticle-treated flaps. Tissue analysis revealed higher number of blood vessels and increased VEGF expression in groups II and III. The cytokines CD31 and MCP-1 were decreased in groups II and IV. Conclusions Bioglass-based nanoparticles exert local anti-inflammatory and neo-angiogenic effects on the distal part of a perforator flap, increasing therefore its survival. Substitutions in the bioglass matrix and trace metal doping allow for further tuning of regenerative activity. These results showcase the potential utility of these nanoparticles in the clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W2902380499,"Pteris (Pteridaceae) spores are usually trilete and can be distinguished by the perine ornamentation. The systematic value of spore morphology in Pteris is unclear, especially based on the renewed infrageneric classification of Pteris. In the present study, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to understand spore characters in 57 Pteris species, one Onychium species, and two Astrolepis species; 40 species are reported here for the first time. The observed spore characters combined with published spore data, totaling 100 species from 16 sections of Pteris, were mapped onto a reconstructed phylogenetic tree. Seven characters (five proposed in previous studies), including an equatorial flange, laesural ridges, proximal ridges, distal ridges, tubercula on distal faces, coarse reticula on distal faces, and a row of extervermiculi between the distal face and equatorial flange, were analyzed to investigate spore morphology evolution in Pteris. However, the results showed no synapomorphies with other genera in Pteridaceae. Most of the characters were found to have arisen independently several times in different lineages or were even frequently reversed. Equatorial flanges and tubercula on distal faces are plesiomorphies and present in most Pteris species. Overall, the application of spore morphology in section circumscription is limited. Thus, we suggest combining spore morphology with leaf characters for Pteris infrageneric classification."
https://openalex.org/W2903115776,"Background We evaluated optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after second-generation drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Material and methods From pooled analysis of three randomized clinical trials (EXCELLENT, IVUS-XPL, RESET), a total of 2,216 patient with ACS undergoing second-generation DES implantation were selected. Each study randomized patients to a short-duration DAPT arm (n = 1119; ≤6 months) or a standard-duration DAPT arm (n = 1097; ≥12 months). Two-thirds of patients were male, and their mean age was 63 years. Mean DAPT durations were 164 ±76 and 359 ±68 days, respectively. The primary endpoint was composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke or major bleeding during the first 12 months after implantation, analyzed according to the intention-to-treat population. Results Demographic characteristics were balanced between groups. Mean DAPT duration was 164 and 359 days, respectively. Primary endpoint occurred in 22 patients with short-DAPT and 21 patients with standard-DAPT (2.0% versus 1.9%; hazard ratio [HR] 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56–1.86; p = 0.94). Landmark analysis after six-months, no significant difference in primary endpoint between short and standard duration DAPT (1.0% versus 0.8%; HR 1.22; 95% CI 0.51–2.95; p = 0.66). Conclusions Short-duration DAPT (≤6 months) demonstrated a similar incidence of net adverse cardiovascular and clinical events at 12 months after second-generation DES in ACS compared with standard duration DAPT (≥12 months).

https://openalex.org/W2903497580,"People can be overly optimistic not only about their own future but also for the people with whom they identify. Furthermore, interpersonal perception generally forms along two universal dimensions, i.e. warmth and competence. In this study, we created four fictional characters that would map onto each quadrant of the two-dimensional space of warmth and competence, i.e. one in-group member (high on both warmth and competence) and three out-group members (high warmth, low competence; high competence, low warmth; low on both warmth and competence). We then asked respondents to assess the likelihood of each character experiencing a series of identical desirable and undesirable events in order to uncover potential optimistic biases. Our study had two goals. First, we wanted to balance the target desirable and undesirable events on four key characteristics, i.e. event frequency, controllability, emotional intensity and personal experience with the event. Second, we wanted to investigate whether stereotypes of warmth and competence could influence the respondents' likelihood estimates for each character. We show that respondents manifested a strong desirability bias, expecting more desirable than undesirable events for the in-group member and the reverse pattern for the extreme out-group member. More important, we show that, within desirable and undesirable events, respondents anchored their judgments for the in-group member on their personal experience with the target events, further revealing an egocentric bias, but turned to stereotypical knowledge in the form of warmth and competence to judge out-group members. Implications for both social perception and optimism research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2902195134,"We propose a complexity measure for black-and-white (B/W) digital images, based on the detection of typical length scales in the depicted motifs. Complexity is associated with diversity in those length scales. In this sense, the proposed measure penalizes images where typical scales are limited to small lengths, of a few pixels –as in an image where gray levels are distributed at random– or to lengths similar to the image size –as when gray levels are ordered into a simple, broad pattern. We introduce a complexity index which captures the structural richness of images with a wide range of typical scales, and compare several images with each other on the basis of this index. Since the index provides an objective quantification of image complexity, it could be used as the counterpart of subjective visual complexity in experimental perception research. As an application of the complexity index, we build a “complexity map” for South-American topography, by analyzing a large B/W image that represents terrain elevation data in the continent. Results show that the complexity index is able to clearly reveal regions with intricate topographical features such as river drainage networks and fjord-like coasts. Although, for the sake of concreteness, our complexity measure is introduced for B/W images, the definition can be straightforwardly extended to any object that admits a mathematical representation as a function of one or more variables. Thus, the quantification of structural richness can be adapted to time signals and distributions of various kinds."
https://openalex.org/W2902603209,"Precision medicine research is underway to identify targeted approaches to improving health and preventing disease. However, such endeavors raise significant privacy and confidentiality concerns. The objective of this study was to elucidate the potential benefits and harms associated with precision medicine research through in-depth interviews with a diverse group of thought leaders, including primarily U.S.-based experts and scholars in the areas of ethics, genome research, health law, historically-disadvantaged populations, informatics, and participant-centric perspectives, as well as government officials and human subjects protections leaders. The results suggest the prospect of an array of individual and societal benefits, as well as physical, dignitary, group, economic, psychological, and legal harms. Relative to the way risks and harms are commonly described in consent forms for precision medicine research, the thought leaders we interviewed arguably emphasized a somewhat different set of issues. The return of individual research results, harm to socially-identifiable groups, the value-dependent nature of many benefits and harms, and the risks to the research enterprise itself emerged as important cross-cutting themes. Our findings highlight specific challenges that warrant concentrated care during the design, conduct, dissemination, and translation of precision medicine research and in the development of consent materials and processes."
https://openalex.org/W2903029065,"Latest WHO guidelines recommend starting HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy treatment (ART) regardless of CD4 count. We assessed additional impact of adopting new WHO guidelines.We used data of individuals aged 15-59 years from three HIV population surveys conducted in 2012 (Kenya) and 2013 (Malawi and South Africa). Individuals were interviewed at home followed by rapid HIV and CD4 testing if tested HIV-positive. HIV-positive individuals were classified as ""eligible for ART"" if (i) had ever been initiated on ART or (ii) were not yet on ART but met the criteria for starting ART based on country's guidelines at the time of the survey (Kenya-CD4< = 350 cells/μl and WHO Stage 3 or 4 disease, Malawi as for Kenya plus lifelong ART for all pregnant and breastfeeding women, South Africa as for Kenya plus ART for pregnant and breastfeeding women until cessation of breastfeeding).Of 18,991 individuals who tested, 4,113 (21.7%) were HIV-positive. Using country's ART eligibility guidelines at the time of the survey, the proportion of HIV-infected individuals eligible for ART was 60.0% (95% CI: 57.2-62.7) (Kenya), 73.4% (70.8-75.8) (South Africa) and 80.1% (77.3-82.6) (Malawi). Applying WHO 2013 guidelines (eligibility at CD4< = 500 and Option B+ for pregnant and breastfeeding women), the proportions eligible were 82.0% (79.8-84.1) (Kenya), 83.7% (81.5-85.6) (South Africa) and 87.6% (85.0-89.8) (Malawi). Adopting ""test and treat"" would mean a further 18.0% HIV-positive individuals (Kenya), 16.3% (South Africa) and 12.4% (Malawi) would become eligible. In all countries, about 20% of adolescents (aged 15-19 years), became eligible for ART moving from WHO 2013 to ""test and treat"" while no differences by sex were observed.Countries that have already implemented 2013 WHO recommendations, the burden of implementing ""test and treat"" would be small. Youth friendly programmes to help adolescents access and adhere to treatment will be needed."

Patterns of weight change associated with diagnoses have not been systematically documented.We use data on adults ages 30+ in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999-2014. Self-reported current weight and weight one year prior are used to estimate percent weight change in the last year. We use self-reported data on arthritis, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver conditions, and respiratory disease diagnoses to compare weight change among individuals never diagnosed with these conditions, individuals diagnosed 0-1 years ago, and individuals diagnosed 2+ years ago. Multinomial logistic regressions adjust for the presence of multiple conditions.17.7% of the adult population experienced weight loss of 5.0% or more in the year prior to survey. Individuals diagnosed with any of the conditions were less likely to maintain their weight than those without a diagnosis. Arthritis, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and liver conditions were associated with net weight loss, whereas respiratory diseases were associated with higher probabilities of both losing and gaining weight. Among those losing 10% or more, 56.7% had been diagnosed with one of the conditions. Cancer was associated with the highest probability of unintentional weight loss and diabetes with the highest probability of intentional weight loss.Disease-associated weight changes leave a distinct imprint on patterns of weight change in the population. Individuals losing at least 10% of their weight in the last year have likely been diagnosed with one of the six conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2902372732,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are important mediators of intercellular communication and have been implicated in myriad physiologic and pathologic processes within the hematopoietic system. Numerous factors influence the ability of EVs to communicate with target marrow cells, but little is known about how circadian oscillations alter EV function. In order to explore the effects of daily rhythms on EV-mediated intercellular communication, we used a well-established model of lung-derived EV modulation of the marrow cell transcriptome. In this model, co-culture of whole bone marrow cells (WBM) with lung-derived EVs induces expression of pulmonary specific mRNAs in the target WBM. To determine if daily rhythms play a role in this phenotype modulation, C57BL/6 mice were entrained in 12-hour light/12-hour dark boxes. Lungs harvested at discrete time-points throughout the 24-hour cycle were co-cultured across a cell-impermeable membrane with murine WBM. Alternatively, WBM harvested at discrete time-points was co-cultured with lung-derived EVs. Target WBM was collected 24hrs after co-culture and analyzed for the presence of pulmonary specific mRNA levels by RT-PCR. In both cases, there were clear time-dependent variations in the patterns of pulmonary specific mRNA levels when either the daily time-point of the lung donor or the daily time-point of the recipient marrow cells was altered. In general, WBM had peak pulmonary-specific mRNA levels when exposed to lung harvested at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 4 and ZT 16 (ZT 0 defined as the time of lights on, ZT 12 defined as the time of lights off), and was most susceptible to lung-derived EV modulation when target marrow itself was harvested at ZT 8- ZT 12. We found increased uptake of EVs when the time-point of the receptor WBM was between ZT 20 -ZT 24, suggesting that the time of day-dependent changes in transcriptome modulation by the EVs were not due simply to differential EV uptake. Based on these data, we conclude that circadian rhythms can modulate EV-mediated intercellular communication."
https://openalex.org/W2903211732,"Immunocompromised pediatric patients constitute a growing population that is particularly vulnerable to bacterial infection, necessitating prompt recognition and treatment. This study assessed the utility of interleukin-27 (IL-27) and procalcitonin (PCT) as biomarkers of bacterial infection among immunocompromised pediatric subjects.This is a single-center prospective cohort study conducted from July 2016 through September 2017, drawing subjects from the inpatient units at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), a large, tertiary care children's hospital. Patients were included if they fit the definition of immunocompromised and were under clinical suspicion for infection, defined by the acquisition of a blood culture at any point during the admission. The primary analysis assessed the accuracy of IL-27 to diagnose bacterial infection in immunocompromised pediatric patients, using PCT as a comparator.293 patients were recruited, representing 400 episodes of suspected bacterial infection. The median age was 7.8 years (IQR 3.1-13.8 years). Fifty-three percent (n = 213) of the population had a primary oncologic diagnosis, 24% (n = 95) had received a bone marrow transplant, and 21% (n = 85) had received a solid organ transplant. The overall infection rate was 37%, with 70% of those patients having some form of culture positivity. Twenty-eight-day mortality was 5%, 60-day mortality was 9%, with 87% of patients surviving to hospital discharge. The AUC's of the ROC curve to diagnose bacterial infection were 0.62 (0.5-0.68) for IL-27 and 0.65 (0.6-0.73) for PCT. Using the previously determined cutoff of 5.0 ng/mL, the specificity of IL-27 to diagnose bacterial infection reached 94%, with a negative predictive value of 64%.Despite prior work demonstrating IL-27 and PCT as possible biomarkers of bacterial infection in immunocompromised pediatric patients, we were unable to validate these findings. This illustrates the challenges associated with developing reliable biomarkers of bacterial infection in this vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W2902475073,"Theobroma cacao, the source of cocoa, is a crop of particular importance in many developing countries. Availability of elite planting material is a limiting factor for increasing productivity of Theobroma cacao; therefore, the development of new strategies for clonal propagation is essential to improve farmers' incomes and to meet increasing global demand for cocoa. To develop a more efficient embryogenesis system for cacao, tissue was transformed with a transgene encoding a fusion of Leafy Cotyledon 2 (TcLEC2) to a glucocorticoid receptor domain (GR) to control nuclear localization of the protein. Upon application of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (dex), downstream targets of LEC2 involved in seed-development were up-regulated and somatic embryos (SEs) were successfully regenerated from TcLEC2-GR transgenic flower and leaf tissue in large numbers. Immature SEs regenerated from TcLEC2-GR leaves were smaller in size than immature SEs from floral tissue, suggesting a different ontogenetic origin. Additionally, exposure of TcLEC2-GR floral explants to dex increased the number of SEs compared to floral explants from control, non-transgenic trees or from TcLEC2-GR floral explants not treated with dex. Testing different durations of exposure to dex indicated that a three-day treatment produced optimal embryo regeneration. Leaf derived SEs were successfully grown to maturity, converted into plants, and established in the greenhouse, demonstrating that these embryos are fully developmentally competent. In summary, we demonstrate that regulating TcLEC2 activity offers a powerful new strategy for optimizing somatic embryogenesis pipelines for cacao."
https://openalex.org/W2902577859,"Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), at the extreme end of the body image concern (BIC) spectrum, is thought to be associated with a local (detail-focussed) visual processing bias. Given that the inversion of a stimulus disrupts holistic processing and demands detail-specific attention, this perceptual bias is characterised by superior processing of such inverted stimuli. This study examined the processing bias, via a body-inversion discrimination task, of 26 participants with non-clinical, high-BIC (Dysmophic Concern Questionnaire (DCQ) scores between 11–19) and 26 participants with low-BIC (DCQ scores between 0–4). This study also explored the impact of varying stimuli presentation durations and discrimination difficulties during the inversion task on visual processing. As hypothesised, compared to those with low-BIC, participants with high-BIC demonstrated superior accuracy when discriminating between images of inverted bodies, indicating a local processing bias. Also as hypothesised, this local processing bias selectively manifested only when stimuli were presented for longer durations and at higher discrimination difficulties, revealing the parameters of this, potentially conscious, processing tendency. Consistent with previous research, this study identified a local processing bias in those with high BIC, which may be a predisposing factor for developing BDD. In turn, identifying the parameters (stimulus exposure and stimulus complexity) in which the local bias manifests has implications for future interventions aiming to reverse this perceptual abnormality."
https://openalex.org/W2950131290,"Mutations in the small heat shock proteins α-crystallins have been linked to autosomal dominant cataracts in humans. Extensive studies in vitro have revealed a spectrum of alterations to the structure and function of these proteins including shifts in the size of the oligomer, modulation of subunit exchange and modification of their affinity to client proteins. Although mouse models of these mutants were instrumental in identifying changes in cellular proliferation and lens development, a direct comparative analysis of their effects on lens proteostasis has not been performed. Here, we have transgenically expressed cataract-linked mutants of αA- and αB-crystallin in the zebrafish lens to dissect the underlying molecular changes that contribute to the loss of lens optical properties. Zebrafish lines expressing these mutants displayed a range of morphological lens defects. Phenotype penetrance and severity were dependent on the mutation even in fish lines lacking endogenous α-crystallin. The mechanistic origins of these differences were investigated by the transgenic co-expression of a destabilized human γD-crystallin mutant. We found that the R49C but not the R116C mutant of αA-crystallin drove aggregation of γD-crystallin, although both mutants have similar affinity to client proteins in vitro. Our working model attributes these differences to the propensity of R49C, located in the buried N-terminal domain of αA-crystallin, to disulfide crosslinking as previously demonstrated in vitro. Our findings complement and extend previous work in mouse models and emphasize the need of investigating chaperone/client protein interactions in appropriate cellular context."

Latent growth curve models were used to investigate the longitudinal trajectory of BMI, and to examine the effect of some personal characteristics on BMI trajectory.The linear model resulted in a mean initial BMI value of 22.90 and a significant mean slope (Ms = 0.19, t = 10.73, p<0.001), suggesting a steady increase in BMI over time for the whole sample. For covariates, the educational level, alcohol and physical activity had differences on initial scores for BMI (β = 0.05, p<0.001; β = -0.12, p<0.05; β = -0.08, p<0.05; respectively.), and the age had differences on both the initial scores and slope for BMI (β = 0.01, p = <0.05; β = -0.03, p<0.01; respectively.). Baseline measures revealed gender-associated differences on initial scores for BMI, and the slope for male was significantly steeper than that for female (β = -0.11, p<0.05). The initial BMI status of Chinese living in the rural areas was significantly higher than that of Chinese living in the urban areas, and the slope for rural status was significantly steeper than that for urban status (β = 0.21, p<0.001).Results indicated a linear trajectory of BMI in the Chinese population over a 12-year period. The longitudinal trajectories differed by age, gender and urban-rural status, suggesting different interventions should be adopted for different groups."

Here, we describe the epidemiology and trends of maternal deaths in Hunan province, and give several policy implications. Methods Maternal deaths in Hunan province between 2009 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to assess the time trends of maternal mortality rates. Binary logistic regression analyses were undertaken to identify the factors that were associated with unavoidable maternal deaths. Results In total, there were 987 maternal deaths, with the overall MMR declining by 45.24%. The most common causes of maternal death during this period were pregnancy complications (28.37%), obstetric hemorrhage (25.33%), and amniotic fluid embolism (15.70%). Obstetric hemorrhage (28.14%) was higher in rural areas, while pregnancy complications were higher (29.27%) in urban areas. In all, 627 (63.5%) deaths were avoidable. The risk factors associated with unavoidable maternal deaths was above 35 years (aOR = 1.80 95%CI: 1.27–2.55), without prenatal examination (aOR = 8.97 95%CI: 1.11–7.78), low household incomes (aOR = 1.15 95%CI: 1.02–1.29), without adopting the new way to deliver (aOR = 5.15 95%CI: 3.20–8.31), and death location (aOR = 1.09 95%CI: 1.02–1.18). The most frequent and important factors associated with avoidable deaths was improper knowledge and skills of the county medical institutions. Conclusions Moderate progress was made in reducing the MMR in Hunan province. The government should aim to improve the basic midwifery skills in rural areas and the obstetric emergency rescue service for critically ill pregnant women in urban areas, and strengthen training to improve knowledge and skills in medical institutions in counties."

In this study, we investigated the antennal morphology, structure and sensilla distribution of C. lividipennis in different instars using scanning electron microscopy. The antennae of both five different nymphal stages and adults were filiform in shape, which consisted of the scape, pedicel and flagellum with two flagellomeres. There were significant differences found in the types of antennal sensilla between nymphs and adults. The multiporous placodea sensilla (MPLA), basiconica sensilla II (BAS II), and sensory pits (SP) only occurred on the antennae of adult C. lividipennis of both sexes. Moreover, there was chaetica sensilla III (CHA III) only observed in males. Sixteen types of antennal sensilla were recorded altogether. They were microtrichia sensilla (MIC), three types of trichoidea sensilla (TRI I-III), three types of chaetica sensilla (CHA I-III), three types of basiconica sensilla (BAS I-III), two types of coeloconica sensilla (COE I and COE II), placodea sensilla (PLA), campaniform sensilla (CAM), MPLA, and SP. In the five different nymphal stages of C. lividipennis, the length of their antennae was significantly increased with the increase of the instar, as well as the number of the TRI II and TRI III. Moreover, sexual dimorphism usually occurred not only in the distribution (CHA III and SP) and the number of antennal sensilla (MIC, BAS II, TRI II, TRI III and MPLA), but also in the length of flagellum (F1 and F2). The possible functions of antennal sensilla are discussed. Those observations could contribute to a better understanding of the development of the olfactory system, and facilitate future studies on the antennal functions in C. lividipennis."

For this reason, hTERT is one of the major targets for cancer therapy, and an efficient method to downregulate hTERT expression is required for treatment of hTERT-positive cancer. In this report, we demonstrated that inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) downregulates the expression of hTERT. We screened cell signaling pathways in AMPK α1 knockout cells and found that AMPKα1 is required for activity of the hTERT promoter. AMPKα1 knockout cells showed decreased expression of hTERT mRNA and protein. We also demonstrated that compound C, a reversible AMPK inhibitor, suppressed the expression of hTERT. However, AMPK activators, including AICAR and metformin, did not increase the level of hTERT protein. Finally, we showed that tumor cells stably expressing hTERT are resistant to compound C treatment. These results indicate that AMPK activity is required for tumor progression."

The aim of this study was to determine whether inactin exerts effects on mitochondrial function and production of reactive oxygen species. Kidney mitochondrial function and production of reactive oxygen after acutely (5 min) or longer (1.5 hour) anesthetizing rats with inactin was evaluated using high-resolution respirometry. The results demonstrate that inactin significantly improves respiratory control ratio, inhibits complex I in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, reduce both unregulated proton leak and time dependently reduce the regulated proton leak via uncoupling protein-2 and adenine nucleotide translocase. Inactin also contributes to increased mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production.

The provision of cash transfers to young women alone in such a context adds another dimension to already existing complex social relations where patriarchal values are entrenched, gender inequality is the norm, and violence against women and girls is pervasive. It raises concerns about complicating young women's relationships with their male partners or possibly even setting them up for more violence. In our attempt to understand how cash transfers influence social relations in the context of a trial among young women in South Africa, we used qualitative data collected during the trial to explore men's perceptions of the impact of cash transfers on male-female relationships, both intimate and platonic, peer relationships.Between April 2012 and August 2015, we conducted focus group discussions (n = 12) and interviews (n = 20) with the male peers and intimate partners of young women aged 13-20 years, who were participating in a phase III randomised controlled trial of CTs for HIV prevention in Mpumalanga, South Africa. A thematic content analysis approach was used to analyse the data. The codebook was developed on the basis of the topic guides, with additional codes added inductively as they emerged from the data.Intimate partners were older (range 20-32 years) and more likely to be working than the male peers. Both intimate partners and male peers were supportive of the CT trial targeting young women; younger peers however expressed some concerns that the money might diminish their power and status in relationships. HIV testing requirements associated with the trial appeared to have improved communication about sex and HIV in intimate relationships, with some women even encouraging their partners to go for an HIV test.CTs provide AGYW with a measure of autonomy and power to contribute in their gendered relationships, albeit in limited ways. However, there is potential for CTs to have a negative impact on male-female relationships if the cash received by AGYW is equal to or greater than the income earned by their male counterparts or sexual partners."
https://openalex.org/W2902455916,"The olive moth -Prays oleae Bern.- remains a significant pest of olive trees showing situation dependent changes in population densities and in severity of damages. The genetic variability of olive moth was assessed on three main olive orchards regions in Portugal by three different markers (COI, nad5 and RpS5), suggesting high species diversity albeit with no obvious relation with a regional pattern nor to an identified ecological niche. Selected COI sequences obtained in this study were combined with those available in the databases for Prays genus to generate a global dataset. The reconstruction of the Prays phylogeny based on this marker revealed the need to revise Prays oleae to confirm its status of single species: COI data suggests the co-existence of two sympatric evolutionary lineages of morphologically cryptic olive moth. We show, however, that the distinct mitochondrial subdivision observed in the partial COI gene fragment is not corroborated by the other DNA sequences. There is the need of understanding this paradigm and the extent of Prays variability, as the disclosure of lineage-specific differences in biological traits between the identified lineages is fundamental for the development of appropriate pest management practices."
https://openalex.org/W2903411949,"In this experiment, we examined whether sensitivity to the relevance of object insides for the categorization of animate objects is in place around 10 months of age. Using an object examining paradigm, 10-month-old infants' (N = 58) were familiarized to novel objects with varying outward appearances but shared insides in one of three groups: No cues, Eyes, and Cue control. During test trials, infants were presented with a novel in-category test object followed by an out-of-category test object. When objects were presented with animacy cues (i.e., Eyes), infants categorized the objects together. In contrast, when objects were presented without any added cues or when they were presented with a shared perceptual marker (Cue control, i.e., plastic spoons placed on top of the objects), infants showed no evidence of categorization. These results indicate that by 10 months of age, eyes signal to infants that objects share some kind of uniting commonality that may not be obvious or readily perceptually available."
https://openalex.org/W2903245379,"Glucocorticoid (GC) refractory relapses in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), who are in potential need of treatment escalation, are a key challenge in routine clinical practice. The pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been shown to be an endogenous counter-regulator of GC, and potentiates autoimmune-mediated neuroinflammation. In order to evaluate whether MIF levels are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients (CSF-MIF), and whether they are higher still during a GC refractory relapse, we compared CSF-MIF concentrations of CIS/MS patients with acute optic neuritis as their first inflammatory episode (ON, n = 20), CIS/MS patients with a stable disease progression/without relapse (CIS/MS w/o, n = 18), and healthy controls (HC, n = 20) using ANOVA. Mean CSF-MIF concentrations in CIS/MS w/o patients were significantly higher than in ON patients and HCs, whereas ON patients and HCs did not differ. A subgroup analysis of the ON group revealed 10 patients to be responsive to GC-treatment (GC-ON) and 10 patients refractory under GC-treatment (rGC-ON). However, mean CSF-MIF concentrations did not differ between GC-ON and rGC-ON cases. We therefore conclude that MIF is not suitable for distinguishing GC responders from non-responders in a group of patients with acute optic neuritis, but it rather mirrors the ongoing inflammation in long-term MS disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2903562575,"With the high cost of the research assessment exercises in the UK, many have called for simpler and less time-consuming alternatives. In this work, we gathered publicly available REF data, combined them with library-subscribed data, and used machine learning to examine whether the overall result of the Research Excellence Framework 2014 could be replicated. A Bayesian additive regression tree model predicting university grade point average (GPA) from an initial set of 18 candidate explanatory variables was developed. One hundred and nine universities were randomly divided into a training set (n = 79) and test set (n = 30). The model “learned” associations between GPA and the other variables in the training set and was made to predict the GPA of universities in the test set. GPA could be predicted from just three variables: the number of Web of Science documents, entry tariff, and percentage of students coming from state schools (r-squared = .88). Implications of this finding are discussed and proposals are given."
https://openalex.org/W2903143698,"Equivocal lesions (ASC-US) are common abnormalities in cervical cancer screening exams. HPV testing helps to stratify the risk of progression to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or more (HSIL+). Population-based medical electronic data can be used to evaluate screening recommendations. The study uses routine electronic data from primary health centers to estimate the impact of HPV testing in a 3- and a 5-year risk of HSIL+ after an ASC-US. The study includes data derived from medical electronic information from 85,775 women who first attended a cervical cancer screening visit at the National Health System facilities of Catalonia, Spain, during 2010-11 and followed up to 2015. Included women were aged between 25-65 years old, having at least one follow-up visit, and a cervical cytology of ASC-US (N = 1,647). Women with a first result of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) (N = 945) or those with negative cytology (N = 83,183) were included for comparison. Those with a baseline HSIL+ were excluded. Incident HSIL+ was evaluated by means of Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate regression models. HPV test results were available for 63.4% of women with a baseline ASC-US. Among all ASC-US, 70 incident HSIL+ were identified at 5 years. ASC-US HPV positive women had a high risk of HSIL+ compared to women with negative cytology (adjusted HR = 32.7; 95% CI: 23.6-45.2) and a similar risk to women with baseline LSIL (HR = 29.3; 95% CI: 22.4-38.2), whereas ASC-US HPV negative women had no differential risk to that observed in baseline negative cytology. Women with ASC-US and no HPV test had an average HSIL+ risk (HR = 14.8; 95% CI: 9.7-22.5). Population-based e-medical records derived from primary health care centers allowed monitoring of screening recommendations, providing robust estimates for the study outcomes. This analysis confirms that HPV testing improved risk stratification of ASC-US lesions. The information can be used to improve diagnosis and management of screen detected lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2783393836,"Background The use of evidence-based practice among healthcare professionals directly correlates to better outcomes for patients and higher professional satisfaction. Translating knowledge in practice and mobilizing evidence-based clinical care remains a continuing challenge in healthcare systems across the world. Purpose To describe experiences from the implementation of an Early Detection and Treatment Program for Children (EDT-C) among health care professionals at a pediatric hospital in Sweden. Design and methods Sixteen individual interviews were conducted with physicians, nurses and nurse assistants, which of five were instructors. Data were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. Results An overarching theme was created: From uncertainty and skepticism towards assurance and control. The theme was based on the content of eight categories: An innovation suitable for clinical practice, Differing conditions for change, Lack of organizational slack, Complex situations, A pragmatic implementation strategy, Delegated responsibility, Experiences of control and Successful implementation. Conclusions Successful implementation was achieved when initial skepticism among staff was changed into acceptance and using EDT-C had become routine in their daily work. Inter-professional education including material from authentic patient cases promotes knowledge about different professions and can strengthen teamwork. EDT-C with evidenced-based material adapted to the context can give healthcare professionals a structured and objective tool with which to assess and treat patients, giving them a sense of control and assurance."
https://openalex.org/W2903000042,"Southern bluefin tuna (SBT) is a valuable species that has been subject to high exploitation rates since the 1950s. In 2011, the spawning stock biomass was estimated to be at a historically low level, at only 5% of pre-fished biomass. A key component for managing and rebuilding the stock is having reliable, fishery-independent estimates of juvenile abundance. This paper describes how such estimates have been constructed from aerial surveys of juvenile (age 2–4) SBT conducted annually in the Great Australian Bight from 1993–2000 and 2005–2009. During these surveys, observers flew along pre-set transect lines searching for surface schools of SBT. Data were collected on the location and biomass of SBT sightings, and on the environmental conditions present during the survey. Sea surface temperature (SST) was found to correlate with the size (biomass) of schools, and several environmental variables, SST and wind speed in particular, were found to correlate with the number of sightings (presumably by affecting the ability of observers to see surface schools as well as whether fish were present at the surface). In addition, observers changed over time and differed in their aptitude for spotting tuna. Thus, generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to standardize the sightings and biomass data to a common set of observers and environmental conditions in order to produce an annual time series of relative abundance estimates. These estimates, which form one of two key inputs to the management procedure used by the international Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna to set the global catch quota, suggest juvenile abundance was highest in the first years of the survey (1993–1996), after which it declined and fluctuated around a level about four times lower."
