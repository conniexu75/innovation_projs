https://openalex.org/W2028242823,"In this paper, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133 is induced 6-fold in vivo, following treatment of PC12 cells with forskolin. By contrast, no such induction was observed in the kinase A-deficient PC12 line A126-1B2 (A126). Using F9 teratocarcinoma cells, which are unresponsive to cAMP, we initiated a series of transient expression experiments to establish a causal link between phosphorylation of CREB and trans-activation of cAMP-responsive genes. Inactivating the kinase A phosphorylation site by in vitro mutagenesis of the cloned CREB cDNA at Ser-133 completely abolished CREB transcriptional activity. As CREB mutants containing acidic residues in place of the Ser-133 phosphoacceptor were also transcriptionally inactive, these results suggest that phosphorylation of CREB may stimulate transcription by a mechanism other than by simply providing negative charge."
https://openalex.org/W2041061869,"The crucial role of the thymus in immunological tolerance has been demonstrated by establishing that T cells are positively selected to express a specificity for self major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and that those T cells bearing receptors potentially reactive to self antigen fragments, presumably presented by thymic MHC, are selected against. The precise mechanism by which tolerance is induced and the stage of T-cell development at which it occurs are not known. We have now studied T-cell tolerance in transgenic mice expressing a T-cell receptor with double specificities for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-H-2Db and for the mixed-lymphocyte stimulatory (MIsa) antigen. We report that alpha beta TCR transgenic mice tolerant to LCMV have drastically reduced numbers of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and of peripheral T cells carrying the CD8 antigen. By contrast, tolerance to MIsa antigen in the same alpha beta TCR transgenic MIsa mice leads to deletion of only mature thymocytes and peripheral T cells and does not affect CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Thus the same transgenic TCR-expressing T cells may be tolerized at different stages of their maturation and at different locations in the thymus depending on the antigen involved."
https://openalex.org/W2121611717,"Three transgenic mouse lines designated Tg 69, 71, and 81 were produced harboring a Syrian hamster (Ha) prion protein (PrP) gene; all expressed the cellular HaPrP isoform in their brains. Inoculation of Tg 81 mice or hamsters with Ha prions caused scrapie in ∼75 days; nontransgenic control mice failed to develop scrapie after >500 days. Tg 71 mice inoculated with Ha prions developed scrapie in ∼170 days. Both Tg 71 and Tg 81 mice exhibited spongiform degeneration and reactive astrocytic gliosis, and they produced the scrapie HaPrP isoform in their brains. Tg 81 brains also showed HaPrP amyloid plaques characteristic of Ha scrapie and contained ∼109 ID50 units of Ha prions based on Ha bioassays. Our findings argue that the PrP gene modulates scrapie susceptibility, incubation times, and neuropathology; furthermore, they demonstrate synthesis of infectious scrapie prions programmed by a recombinant DNA molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2055166643,Many Drosophila developmental genes contain a DNA binding domain encoded by the homeobox. This homeodomain contains a region distantly homologous to the helix-turn-helix motif present in several prokaryotic DNA binding proteins. We investigated the nature of homeodomain-DNA interactions by making a series of mutations in the helix-turn-helix motif of the Drosophila homeodomain protein Paired (Prd). This protein does not recognize sequences bound by the homeodomain proteins Fushi tarazu (Ftz) or Bicoid (Bcd). We show that changing a single amino acid at the C-terminus of the recognition helix is both necessary and sufficient to confer the DNA binding specificity of either Ftz or Bcd on Prd. This simple rule indicates that the amino acids that determine the specificity of homeodomains are different from those mediating protein-DNA contacts in prokaryotic proteins. We further show that Prd contains two DNA binding activities. The Prd homeodomain is responsible for one of them while the other is not dependent on the recognition helix.
https://openalex.org/W2062423659,"The nuclear protein LF-B1 (also referred to as HNF-1) is a transcription activator required for the expression of several liver-specific genes. LF-B1 has been purified to homogeneity from rat liver nuclear extracts. The sequence of the protein has been partially determined and, subsequently, overlapping cDNA clones containing the entire open reading frame of LF-B1 were isolated. The full-length cDNA encodes a 628 amino acid protein and directs the synthesis in vitro of a protein capable of binding DNA with the same specificity as LF-B1. The cDNA was recombined into a vaccinia virus vector and active LF-B1 was obtained from infected HeLa cells. Addition of the vaccinia recombinant protein to rat spleen extracts results in activation of transcription of an LF-B1-dependent promoter. The DNA binding domain of LF-B1 is located in the amino-terminal part of the protein and displays distant structural similarity to the homeobox domain. The distribution of LF-B1 mRNA is restricted to liver, which correlates with the tissue-specific expression of its target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2152134406,"The structure of the Antennapedia homeodomain from Drosophila melanogaster was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in solution. It includes three well-defined helices (residues 10-21, 28-38, and 42-52) and a more flexible fourth helix (residues 53-59). Residues 30-50 form a helix-turn-helix motif virtually identical to those observed in various prokaryotic repressors. Further comparisons of the homeodomain with prokaryotic repressors showed that there are also significant differences in the molecular architectures. Overall, these studies support the view that the third helix of the homeodomain may function as the DNA recognition site. The elongation of the third helix by the fourth helix is a structured element that so far appears to be unique to the Antennapedia homeodomain."
https://openalex.org/W2066769462,"The proposal that the absorption maximum of the visual pigments is governed by interaction of the 11-cis-retinal chromophore with charged carboxylic acid side chains in the membrane-embedded regions of the proteins has been tested by mutating five Asp and Glu residues thought to be buried in rhodopsin. Changing Glu113 to Gln causes a dramatic shift in the absorption maximum from 500 nanometers to 380 nanometers, a decrease in the pKa (acidity constant) of the protonated Schiff base of the chromophore to about 6, and a greatly increased reactivity with hydroxylamine. Thus Glu113 appears to be the counterion to the protonated Schiff base. Wavelength modulation in visual pigments apparently is not governed by electrostatic interaction with carboxylate residues, other than the counterion."

https://openalex.org/W1994664430,"Voltage clamp recordings and noise analysis from pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices indicate that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are tonically active. On the basis of the known concentration of glutamate in the extracellular fluid, this tonic action is likely caused by the ambient glutamate level. NMDA receptors are voltage-sensitive, thus background activation of these receptors imparts a regenerative electrical property to pyramidal cells, which facilitates the coupling between dendritic excitatory synaptic input and somatic action potential discharge in these neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2070947895,"The signals that direct membrane proteins to the apical or basolateral plasma membrane domains of polarized epithelial cells are not known. Several of the class of proteins anchored in the membrane by glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) are expressed on the apical surface of such cells. However, it is not known whether the mechanism of membrane anchorage or the polypeptide sequence provides the sorting information. The conversion of the normally basolateral vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) to a GPI-anchored protein led to its apical expression. Conversely, replacement of the GPI anchor of placental alkaline phosphatase with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of VSV G shifted its expression from the apical to the basolateral surface. Thus, the mechanism of membrane anchorage can determine the sorting of proteins to the apical or basolateral surface, and the GPI anchor itself may provide an apical transport signal."
https://openalex.org/W1998465616,"A plasma membrane form of guanylate cyclase is a cell surface receptor for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). In response to ANP binding, the receptor-enzyme produces increased amounts of the second messenger, guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate. Maximal activation of the cyclase requires the presence of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) or nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs. The intracellular region of the receptor contains at least two domains with homology to other proteins, one possessing sequence similarity to protein kinase catalytic domains, the other to regions of unknown function in a cytoplasmic form of guanylate cyclase and in adenylate cyclase. It is now shown that the protein kinase-like domain functions as a regulatory element and that the second domain possesses catalytic activity. When the kinase-like domain was removed by deletion mutagenesis, the resulting ANP receptor retained guanylate cyclase activity, but this activity was independent of ANP and its stimulation by ATP was markedly reduced. A model for signal transduction is suggested in which binding of ANP to the extracellular domain of its receptor initiates a conformational change in the protein kinase-like domain, resulting in derepression of guanylate cyclase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1518457310,"Acquired resistance to multiple natural products in vitro is mediated by P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Expression of this protein has been demonstrated in some normal tissues and in tumor samples obtained from both untreated and treated patients. In situ hybridizations with RNA probes have demonstrated higher levels of expression of mdr-1/Pgp in well-differentiated tumors and in well-differentiated areas in tumors with mixed histologies. Expression of mdr-1/Pgp in human colon carcinoma cell lines was increased by the differentiating agents sodium butyrate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and dimethylformamide. In the SW-620 cell line addition of sodium butyrate resulted in a rapid induction of mdr-1/Pgp mRNA that was sustained for the duration of the exposure. The levels of P-glycoprotein were measured by immunoblotting and were also increased. Similar results were obtained in three other cell lines including the HCT-15 line. This induction occurred without alterations in nuclease sensitivity. Discontinuation of sodium butyrate was followed by a rapid fall in the levels of mRNA. The levels of P-glycoprotein returned to normal with a half-life of about 24 h. In spite of a 20-25-fold increase in the level of mdr-1/Pgp mRNA and P-glycoprotein, the SW-620 cell line did not demonstrate increased resistance to doxorubicin and vinblastine or decreased accumulation of vinblastine. In contrast, in the HCT-15 cell line, a 5-fold increase of mdr-1/Pgp was accompanied by a comparable fall in vinblastine accumulation which was reversed by verapamil. In the SW-620 cell line, the induced protein could be photolabeled using [3H]azidopine. Expression of mdr-1/Pgp appears to correlate with the degree of differentiation. However, its induction is not always accompanied by expression of the multidrug-resistance phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2088559138,Stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis by excitatory amino acids was studied in synaptoneurosomes of kitten striate cortex at several postnatal ages. Ibotenate and glutamate stimulated phosphoinositide turnover during the second and third postnatal months; N-methyl-D-aspartate and DL-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) were without effect. The developmental profile of ibotenate-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover parallels the postnatal changes in cortical susceptibility to visual deprivation. The transient increase in ibotenate-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover does not occur in visual cortex of kittens reared in complete darkness.
https://openalex.org/W1607894141,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is thought to be absent in the heart since the latter is highly catabolic and nonlipogenic. It has been suggested that the high level of malonyl-CoA that is found in the heart is derived from mitochondrial propionyl-CoA carboxylase, which also uses acetyl-CoA. In the present study, acetyl-CoA carboxylase was identified and purified from homogenates of rat heart. The isolated enzyme had little activity in the absence of citrate (specific activity, less than 0.1 units/mg); however, citrate stimulated its activity (specific activity, 1.8 units/mg in the presence of 10 mM citrate). Avidin inhibited greater than 95% of activity, and addition of biotin reversed this inhibition. Further, malonyl-CoA (1 mM) and palmitoyl-CoA (100 microM) inhibited greater than 90% of carboxylase activity. Similar to acetyl-CoA carboxylase of lipogenic tissues, the heart enzyme could be activated greater than 6-fold by preincubation with liver (acetyl-CoA carboxylase)-phosphatase 2. The activation was accompanied by a decrease in the K0.5 for citrate to 0.68 mM. These observations suggest that the activity in preparations from heart is due to authentic acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the preparation from heart showed the presence of one major protein band (Mr 280,000) and a minor band (Mr 265,000) while that from liver gave a major protein band (Mr 265,000). A Western blot probed with avidin-peroxidase suggested that both the 280- and 265-kDa species contained biotin. Antibodies to liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which inhibited greater than 95% of liver carboxylase activity, inhibited only 35% of heart enzyme activity. In an immunoblot (using antibodies to liver enzyme) the 265-kDa species, and not the major 280-kDa species, in the heart preparation was specifically stained. These observations suggest the presence of two isoenzymes of acetyl-CoA carboxylase that are immunologically distinct, the 265-kDa species being predominant in the liver and the 280-kDa species being predominant in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W1483990585,"Previous biochemical studies on cartilage tissue from a proband with Type II achondrogenesis-hypochondrogenesis (Godfrey, M., and Hollister, D. W. (1988) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 43, 904-913) indicated heterozygosity for a structural abnormality in the triple helical domain of pro-alpha 1 (II) collagen. Here we demonstrate that the mutation in the type II procollagen gene is a single base change that converts the codon for glycine (GGC) at amino acid 943 of the alpha 1 (II) chain to a codon for serine (AGC). The substitution disrupts the invariant Gly-X-Y structural motif necessary for perfect triple helix formation and leads to extensive overmodification, intracellular retention, and reduced secretion of type II collagen. These findings confirm the proposal that new dominant mutations in the type II procollagen gene may account for some cases of Type II achondrogenesis-hypochondrogenesis. Since recent studies (Lee, B., Vissing, H., Ramirez, F., Rogers, D., and Rimoin, D. (1989) Science 244, 978-980) have identified a dominantly inherited type II procollagen gene deletion in a non-lethal form of skeletal dysplasia, namely spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, the data more generally demonstrate that different type II procollagen gene mutations eventuate in a wide and diverse spectrum of clinical phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2003568266,"Homeodomain proteins are believed to direct developmental pathways during Drosophila embryogenesis by the specific regulation of other genes. An unresolved issue is whether it is the homeodomain or the other regions of such proteins that confer target specificity. To test the role of the homeodomain in determining target specificity, we replaced the homeobox of Deformed with the homeobox of Ultrabithorax. The resulting chimeric protein cannot activate transcription from the Deformed gene, as does the normal Deformed protein. Instead, the chimeric protein activates ectopic transcription of Antennapedia, a gene normally regulated by Ultrabithorax. Our results indicate that in the context of the developing embryo, even closely related homeodomain sequences have different target specificities."
https://openalex.org/W1996091760,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) binds to CD4-positive cells through interaction of its envelope glycoprotein (gp120) with the CD4 molecule. CD4 is a prominent immunoregulatory molecule, and chronic exposure to antibody against CD4 (anti-CD4) has been shown to cause immunodeficiency in mice. T cell-dependent in vitro immune responses can also be inhibited by anti-CD4. Experimental findings reported here indicate that CD4-bound gp120 attracts gp120-specific antibodies derived from the blood of HIV-seropositive individuals to form a trimolecular complex with itself and CD4. Thus targeted to CD4, the gp120-specific antibody functions as an antibody to CD4; it cross-links and modulates the CD4 molecules and suppresses the activation of T cells as measured by mobilization of intracellular calcium (Cai2+). The synergism between gp120 and anti-gp120 in blocking T cell activation occurs at low concentrations of both components. Neither gp120 nor anti-gp120 inhibits T cell activation by itself in the concentrations tested."
https://openalex.org/W1561828918,"The hypothesis that Na+-dependent calcium extrusion is important in protecting against neuronal excitotoxicity was tested. In cocultures of embryonic rat hippocampal neurons and mouse neuroblastoma hybrid (NCB-20) cells, calcium ionophore A23187 (1 μM) or high levels of extracellular K+ killed hippocampal neurons selectively, leaving NCB-20 cells unscathed. Hippocampal neurons showed large, sustained rises in intracellular calcium in response to A23187 or K+, whereas NCB-20 cells showed only transient calcium responses. The abilities of NCB-20 cells to reduce the calcium load and to survive exposure to A23187 or K+ were dependent on extracellular Na+, suggesting that an active Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism was important in protecting against cell death. Finally, removal of extracellular Na+ reduced the threshold for glutamate neurotoxicity in hippocampal neurons, demonstrating the importance of Na+/Ca2+ exchange in protecting against excitotoxicity. Taken together, these findings suggest that differences in cell calcium-regulating systems may determine whether a neuron lives or degenerates in the face of an excitatory challenge.—Mattson, M.

The ULG shows Mendelian segregation, but its genetic map is circular. Molecular cloning of fragments of the ULG was accomplished by taking advantage of restriction fragment length polymorphisms generated by crosses to Chlamydomonas smithii. These clones were used as probes to determine the size and form of the ULG chromosome; it is a 6-9 megabase linear molecule. Use of the probes for in situ DNA hybridization in cells localized the ULG chromosome to basal bodies."
https://openalex.org/W1523341154,"The HA2 adaptor complex, comprising alpha-, beta-, 50-kDa, and 16-kDa subunits, was partially dissociated into its constituents with 3 M urea, and the beta-subunit was purified from the mixture by hydroxylapatite and affinity chromatography. The renatured beta-subunit behaves hydrodynamically as a single polypeptide of Mr approximately 128,000. In a sedimentation assay the purified beta-polypeptide co-sediments with pre-formed clathrin cages. The beta-polypeptide, however, will not induce assembly of clathrin triskelia. Our results support the conjecture that the beta-type subunits (beta and beta') of the HA2 and HA2 adaptor complexes serve to attach the HA-2 adaptor complex to clathrin (Ahle, S., Mann, A., Eichelsbacher, U., and Ungewickell, E. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 919-929), while the other subunits may determine the specificity of binding to docking proteins and receptors on cytoplasmic membrane surfaces."

https://openalex.org/W1552108906,"Abstract Activation of beta-adrenergic and somatostatin receptors increases and attenuates, respectively, cAMP. We have determined, however, that in enteric endocrine cells beta-adrenergic and somatostatin receptors also regulate Na-H exchange activity, independent of their effects on cAMP. In cells loaded with a pH-sensitive dye, epinephrine, acting at a beta 2-adrenergic receptor induced an alkalinization while somatostatin caused an acidification of intracellular pH (pHi). These pHi changes were dependent on extracellular Na+ and inhibited by amiloride. Forskolin, dibutyryl-cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP, however, had no effect on pHi. Cholera toxin, while decreasing the EC50 for epinephrine-stimulated increases in cAMP, had no effect on epinephrine-induced alkalinization, suggesting receptor coupling to Na-H exchange was not mediated by a cholera toxin-sensitive stimulatory GTP-binding protein (Gs). Additionally, epinephrine stimulated Na-H exchange in cyc- variants of S49 lymphoma cells, which lack a fundamental Gs. In the presence of pertussis toxin, somatostatin attenuation of cAMP was completely reversed; however, somatostatin inhibition of Na-H exchange was not affected. We suggest that beta-adrenergic and somatostatin receptors regulate Na-H exchange independent of changes in cAMP and possibly independent of GTP-binding proteins previously described as being coupled to these receptors."

The findings indicate that glutathione is actively metabolized in the choroid plexus by pathways similar to those in kidney and other tissues. The level of glutathione in the cerebrospinal fluid can be decreased or increased by giving compounds that do not, under similar conditions, appreciably alter total brain levels of glutathione. Glutathione monoethyl ester is effectively transported into the cerebrospinal fluid."

https://openalex.org/W1503782530,"Replacement of the aspartate residue at position 59 of rat oncomodulin by glutamate by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis has afforded a protein which more closely resembles rat parvalbumin, at least judged by its interaction with the luminescent lanthanide ion Eu3+. The single-peak 7F0----5D0 spectrum observed at pH 5.0 with the fully bound wild-type protein is replaced by one which clearly shows two features at 5791 and 5796 A, arising from Eu3+ ions bound at the CD and EF sites, respectively. Furthermore, the pH dependence of the spectrum is substantially altered; the pKa observed for the CD domain, in which aspartate 59 residues, is shifted upward from pH 6.0 for the wild-type recombinant protein to pH 6.8 in the D59E mutant. Moreover, the maximum in the high-pH spectrum is shifted from 5781 to 5784 A. All three changes are indicative of a CD binding domain having increased parvalbumin-like character. Interestingly, however, the D59E substitution has only a modest effect on the Ca2+- and Mg2+-binding properties of the CD domain. For the wild-type protein, KCa = 7.8 x 10(-7) M and KMg = 3 x 10(-3) M. These affinities are more than an order of magnitude weaker than those seen for various parvalbumins and substantiate previous claims for calcium specificity made for the oncomodulin CD domain. Replacement of aspartate 59 by glutamate resulted in minor increases in affinity of the CD domain for Ca2+ (KCa = 5.5 x 10(-7) M) and Mg2+ (KMg = 1 x 10(-3) M). These findings strongly suggest that residues in oncomodulin besides aspartate 59 are important determinants of the observed calcium specificity of the CD calcium-binding domain. The consequences of the substitution at residue 59 appear to be confined to the CD domain. For the EF site in wild-type recombinant oncomodulin, KCa = 4.2 x 10(-8) M and KMg = 1.6 x 10(-4) M. The corresponding values for the D59E site-specific variant are identical within experimental error (KCa = 4.2 x 10(-8) M and KMg = 1.8 x 10(-4) M)."
https://openalex.org/W1500674096,"Retinol, a morphogen, has been shown to induce morphological changes in vascular endothelial cells, accompanied by an acute and specific accumulation of an 80-kDa protein; purification and characterization of this retinol-induced protein (RIP) have revealed that it is a transglutaminase. Endothelial cells from bovine carotid artery were cultured, treated with retinol, and examined for changes in morphology and protein profiles. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of extracts prepared from retinol-treated cells which had undergone a remarkable change in shape (from a cobblestone-like to a spindle-like shape) indicated that the retinol-induced morphological change is accompanied by a marked increase of an 80-kDa protein. Similar changes were also induced by retinoic acid. The 80-kDa RIP was purified by anion exchange and hydroxyapatite column chromatography. Amino acid sequencing of tryptic fragments of the purified RIP revealed a high degree of homology between the sequence of bovine RIP and that of guinea pig liver transglutaminase, suggesting that RIP is a transglutaminase. This was confirmed by activity measurements; RIP exhibited transglutaminase activity, and an antiserum against RIP immunoprecipitated the activity. These results suggest that transglutaminase plays important roles in the maintenance of morphology and the control of endothelial cell functions."
https://openalex.org/W1942359435,"Abstract An atomic model of 43,692 non-hydrogen atoms has been determined for the 12-subunit enzyme glutamine synthetase from Salmonella typhimurium, by methods of x-ray diffraction including restrained least-squares atomic refinement against 65,223 unique reflections. At 3.5 A resolution the crystallographic R-factor (on 2 sigma data) is 25.8%. As reported earlier for the unrefined structure, the 12 subunits are arranged in two layers of six; at the interface of pairs of subunits within each layer, cylindrical active sites are formed by six anti-parallel beta strands contributed by one subunit and two strands by the neighboring subunit. This interpretation of the electron density map has now been supported by comparison with glutamine synthetase from Escherichia coli by the Fourier difference method. Each active site cylinder holds two Mn2+ ions, with each ion having as ligands three protein side chains and two water molecules (one water shared by both metals), as well as a histidyl side chain just beyond liganding distance. The protein ligands to Mn2+ 469 are Glu-131, Glu-212, and Glu-220; those to Mn2+ 470 are Glu-129, His-269, and Glu-357. The two layers of subunits are held together largely by the apolar COOH terminus, a helical thong, which inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed by two neighboring subunits on the opposite ring. Also between layers, there is a hydrogen-bonded beta sheet interaction, as there is between subunits within a ring, but hydrophobic interactions account for most of the intersubunit stability. The central loop, which extends into the central aqueous channel, is subject to attack by at least five enzymes and is discussed as an enzyme passive site."

https://openalex.org/W1566330131,"The atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) stimulates cGMP production and protein phosphorylation in a particulate fraction of cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Three proteins of 225, 132, and 11 kDa were specifically phosphorylated in response to ANP treatment, addition of cGMP (5 nM), or addition of purified cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor had no effect on the cGMP-stimulated phosphorylation of the three proteins but inhibited cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of a 17-kDa protein. These results demonstrate that the particulate cGMP-dependent protein kinase mediates the phosphorylation of the 225-, 132-, and 11-kDa proteins. The 11-kDa protein is phospholamban based on the characteristic shift in apparent Mr from 11,000 to 27,000 on heating at 37 degrees C rather than boiling prior to electrophoresis. ANP (1 microM) increased the cGMP concentration approximately 4-fold in the particulate fractions, from 4.3 to 17.7 nM, as well as the phosphorylation of the 225-, 132-, and 11-kDa proteins. In contrast, the biologically inactive form of ANP, carboxymethylated ANP (1 microM), did not stimulate phosphorylation of any proteins nor did the unrelated peptide hormone, angiotensin II (1 microM). These results demonstrate the presence of the cGMP-mediated ANP signal transduction pathway in a particulate fraction of smooth muscle cells and the specific phosphorylation of three proteins including phospholamban, which may be involved in ANP-dependent relaxation of smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1553444768,"Abstract The interaction of endothelial cells with soluble or substrate-immobilized 125I-labeled fibrinogen (125I-FGN) was analyzed. Binding experiments involved incubation of 125I-FGN with cell suspensions at 4 degrees C. Bound ligand was quantitated by centrifugation of cells through silicone oil followed by scintillation analysis of the cell pellet. Calcium-dependent binding of 125I-FGN reached a maximum after 3 h and represented about 60% of the total. Half-maximal saturation occurred at 60 nM, and about 9 x 10(4) molecules were bound/cell at saturation (approximately 100 nM). Calcium-dependent binding was completely inhibited by unlabeled fibrinogen, partially inhibited by a monoclonal antibody (7E3) against glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, but not inhibited by fibrinogen fragments D or E, an anti-glycoprotein IIIa polyclonal antibody, or the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser tetrapeptide. In contrast, the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser tetrapeptide as well as the monoclonal antibody 7E3 markedly inhibited attachment of endothelial cells to substrate-immobilized fibrinogen, whereas fragment D or E did not. Both in suspension and monolayer, the 125I-FGN underwent cross-linking involving principally the A alpha chain. The transglutaminase inhibitors putrescine, histamine, and cystamine interfered with 125I-FGN binding and cross-linking by suspended cells. Since cross-linking in suspension was limited to bound 125I-FGN and since transglutaminase activity was not detectable in the binding buffer, cross-linking may have been mediated by a cell-associated transglutaminase."

The administration of alpha 1-adrenergic blockers to hepatectomized rats prevented the association of CaM with the nuclear matrix without affecting the increase in the total nuclear CaM. The inhibitory effect of the alpha 1-antagonists was reversed by the simultaneous injection of the alpha-agonist noradrenaline. Since the activation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors results in the release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum stores, the results suggest that the association of CaM with the nuclear matrix during proliferative activation is mediated by Ca2+ released from endoplasmic reticulum and show that the association with the matrix is independent of its intranuclear accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1547792612,"Abstract Clathrin-coated vesicle acidification is mediated by an endomembrane proton translocating ATPase. This pump is electrogenic, and significant pH gradient formation requires the parallel movement of chloride through a chloride transporter in order to maintain net electroneutrality. We have solubilized, isolated and achieved 270-fold purification of this chloride transporter by means of selective detergent solubilization with cholate and polyoxyethelene 9-lauryl ether (C12E9), hydroxylapatite chromatography, and glycerol gradient centrifugation. Stabilization of the solubilized transporter requires 5 mM dithiothreitol. The partially purified transporter was co-reconstituted with the purified clathrin-coated vesicle proton translocating complex to yield preparations of proteoliposomes capable of valinomycin-independent proton pumping, as assessed by ATP-generated acridine orange quenching. In addition, the chloride transporter was independently reconstituted and was shown to catalyze diisothiocyano-disulfonic acid stilbene-sensitive 36Cl uptake. The anionic conductive selectivity of the reconstituted transporter (chloride = bromide greater than nitrate) exactly matched that of the transporter of native clathrin-coated vesicles. These studies demonstrate that the chloride transporter of vacuolar acidification systems is structurally and functionally dissociable from co-existing proton pumps and allow for investigations of pump-transporter interactions in a resolved system."

https://openalex.org/W1528711266,"Abstract Targeting of channels in renal epithelia may involve trafficking of clathrin-coated vesicles. We have isolated and measured the osmotic permeability (Pf) of purified clathrin-coated vesicles from bovine kidney cortex and inner medulla, and bovine brain, a tissue not expected to contain water channels. Brain-coated vesicles had a diameter of 80 nm in negatively stained preparations. Pf was measured by a stopped-flow light scattering technique. In brain-coated vesicles, transport was functionally homogeneous with a low Pf of 0.0016 +/- 0.0001 cm/s (seven preparations, 23 degrees C). Pf was independent of osmotic gradient size (25-300 mOsm), not inhibited by mercurials, and not altered by removal of the clathrin coat. The activation energy (Ea) for Pf was high (11 +/- 1 kcal/mol less than 34 degrees C, 17 +/- 2 kcal/mol greater than 34 degrees C). Therefore, channels are absent from brain-coated vesicles. In contrast, there were two functional populations of vesicles in coated vesicle preparations from both kidney cortex and medulla. One population of vesicles had low permeability and no channels, whereas a second population had high Pf (0.02 cm/s, 21 degrees C) that was inhibited by HgCl2, and low Ea (2-3 kcal/mol). The fraction of vesicles with high Pf was 52 +/- 3% (S.D., n = 3, cortical vesicles) and 26 +/- 3% (medullary vesicles). These results provide evidence that functional channels are not present in clathrin-coated vesicles from the brain, whereas they are found in a population of coated vesicles from kidney cortex and medulla, tissues in which channels are recycled between the plasma membrane, and an intracellular compartment."

https://openalex.org/W1527485558,"The primary translation product encoded by sea raven antifreeze protein mRNA was labeled during cell-free synthesis with [3H]leucine. N-terminal sequencing of the immunoselected translation product showed that the third AUG in the mRNA is used as the initiating methionine codon. The antifreeze protein precursor is therefore 163 amino acids long. Amino acid analysis and sequencing of the deblocked N-terminal peptide from the mature circulating form of the antifreeze indicated that glutamine at position 35 is the N-terminal residue. The most likely site of signal peptide cleavage is after alanine at position 17, suggesting that the sea raven antifreeze protein is produced as a preproprotein. Analysis of slot blots indicates that the gene for the antifreeze protein is present in 12-15 copies in the sea raven genome. A representative gene copy was sequenced. It is split into six exons spanning 2.2 kilobase pairs and, based on composite maps of genomic clones, is not accompanied by a second copy within at least 25 kilobase pairs of flanking DNA. The transcription start site was determined by primer extension. Ninety base pairs upstream from this point, beyond the CAAT and TATA boxes, is a putative cis-acting regulatory element in the form of a triplicated 21-base pair tandem repeat."
https://openalex.org/W1603924503,"Abstract The human gastric tumoral cell line HGT-1 was previously shown to contain a membrane somatostatin receptor negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase through a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory GTP-binding regulatory protein (Gi) (Reyl-Desmars, F., Laboisse, C., and Lewin, M. J. M. (1986) Regul. Pept. 16, 207-215). In this study, we have solubilized this receptor in a free unoccupied form using Triton X-100 as detergent and [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin-14 to monitor specific binding. Furthermore, we have prepared a monoclonal antibody against a chromatographically enriched soluble receptor fraction and used this antibody (30F3) to immunopurify the receptor in conjunction with Sepharose-somatostatin-14 immunopurification and steric exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The purified fraction showed 18,600-fold enrichment in terms of specific binding (i.e. from 0.6 +/- 0.05 to 11,300 +/- 830 pmol/mg of protein) and a single dissociation constant (kappa D) of 76 +/- 8 nM. On HPLC, it migrated as a single and symmetric 90-kDa peak. Moreover, after 125I-protein labeling, it gave a single 90-kDa band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis autoradiography. On the other hand, the 30F3 monoclonal antibody immunoblotted with a single 90-kDa band contained in the HGT-1 cell membrane. We therefore suggest that this antibody is specific to the HGT-1 membrane somatostatin receptor, that this receptor has a molecular mass of 90 kDa, and that we have obtained a homogeneous preparation of nondenatured receptor suitable for further cloning studies."

https://openalex.org/W1520279511,"Abstract Endocytic uptake of [3H]sucrose and lucifer yellow, markers for fluid-phase endocytosis, was studied in cultures of the renal epithelial cell lines LLC-PK1 and OK. Endocytosis in LLC-PK1 cells was inhibited when the cells were grown in the presence of gentamicin (1 mg/ml) for 4 days or when the cells were treated with concanavalin A (1 mg/ml) for 5 h. These changes occurred without perturbation of intracellular Na+ and K+ content, indicating that the cells maintained normal ion gradients. The inhibition of endocytosis was accompanied by marked increases in the apparent Vmax for Na+-dependent cell uptake of solutes such as Pi and L-alanine. The apparent Km was unchanged. In contrast, treatment of OK cells with concanavalin A produced marked stimulation of endocytosis and inhibition of the Na+-dependent uptake of Pi and L-glutamate. These changes occurred in the absence of changes in intracellular Na+ and K+ content. Neither gentamicin nor concanavalin A had a direct effect on Na+/solute cotransport in these cell lines. The changes in Na+/Pi cotransport induced by concanavalin A in both LLC-PK1 and OK cells were blocked by keeping the cells at 4 degrees C during exposure to the lectin, suggesting that endocytosis may be part of the mechanism which mediates the changes in solute uptake. The reciprocal relationship between the changes in endocytosis and the changes in Na+/solute cotransport is consistent with the possibility that the number of Na+/solute cotransporters present in the plasma membrane may be altered by an increase or decrease in the rate of membrane internalization by endocytosis. The Vmax changes in Na+/solute cotransport provide indirect support for this conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W1547737189,"Abstract Large domains rich in serine and threonine, that are likely to exhibit clusters of O-linked oligosaccharides, have been reported adjacent to the anchor of several cell surface proteins. No such domain is evident in the primary sequence of rat renal gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. However, papain treatment of the amphipathic enzyme (Triton-purified gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, T gamma GT), pretreated with galactose oxidase and NaB3H4 (Frielle, T., and Curthoys, N. P. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 5709-5714), yields the hydrophilic enzyme (papain-treated Triton-purified gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, PT gamma GT) and a labeled peptide which contains both the amino-terminal membrane anchor and the sequence Pro27-Thr28-Thr29-Ser30. Since [3H]galactose was identified in this peptide, the presence of O-linked oligosaccharides was investigated. Carbohydrate analysis is consistent with the presence of two simple O-linked oligosaccharides on T gamma GT and one on PT gamma GT. Lectin blot analysis of T gamma GT and PT gamma GT was carried out after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The small subunits of both T gamma GT and PT gamma GT and the large amphipathic subunit of T gamma GT all react with the peanut agglutinin lectin, but the large subunit of PT gamma GT exhibits no such reactivity. The reactivity with PNA is consistent with the presence of one oligosaccharide with the structure galactose beta 1-3N-acetylgalactosamine alpha 1-Ser/Thr attached to each subunit of T gamma GT. The papain-sensitivity of the oligosaccharide from the larger subunit is consistent with O-glycosylation at the Thr28-Thr29-Ser30 sequence. The results of lectin blot analysis with wheat germ agglutinin imply that the content of N-linked oligosaccharides is unaffected by papain treatment of the transpeptidase. These data represent the first direct evidence for O-glycosylation of a microvillar hydrolase at a site immediately adjacent to the membrane anchor and indicates that even small clusters of Thr and Ser can be O-glycosylated. Isolated O-linked oligosaccharides may have functional significance since single Ser and Thr residues are consistently found near the membrane anchor of many cell surface proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1546731168,"Chronic glucocorticoid treatment results in skeletal muscle wasting. However, if the contractile activity of muscle is increased, this effect is abated. Because the gene encoding glutamine synthetase is known to be glucocorticoid inducible, it represents an appropriate model for testing whether glucocorticoids and endurance training can exert antagonistic effects on the expression of specific genes in muscle tissue. Our data confirm that administration of hydrocortisone 21-acetate to rats produces 2.4- and 5.9-fold increases in plantaris muscle glutamine synthetase enzyme activity and mRNA, respectively. Moreover, subjecting rats to a 12- to 16-wk exercise program diminishes the basal levels of these indices of glutamine synthetase expression to approximately 60% of the values observed in sedentary controls. Endurance training produces a similar effect on plantaris muscle glutamine synthetase expression in glucocorticoid-treated animals. These data demonstrate that the therapeutic effects of exercise in counteracting muscle atrophy are associated with attenuation of expression of a glucocorticoid-inducible gene in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1558805617,"Abstract High resolution 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and optical stopped-flow techniques have been used to study the metal binding properties of a site-specific mutant of bacterial recombinant oncomodulin in which glutamate has replaced a liganding aspartate at position 59 in the CD calcium-binding site. In particular we have followed the replacement of calcium by lutetium in bacterial recombinant oncomodulin and D59E oncomodulin to provide a measure of the protein's preferences for metal ions of different ionic radii. The result of the Asp----Glu substitution is to make the mutant oncomodulin more similar to rat parvalbumin in terms of its relative CD- and EF-domain affinities for lutetium(III), that is to increase its affinity for metal ions with smaller ionic radii. This finding supports the original hypothesis that the presence of Asp at sequence position 59 is an important factor in the reduced preference of the CD site of oncomodulin for smaller metals such as magnesium (Williams, T. C., Corson, D. C., Sykes, B. D., and MacManus, J. P. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 6248-6256). However, our studies show that both the CD and the EF sites are affected by this single residue substitution suggesting that many factors play a role in the metal binding affinity and interaction between the two sites."
https://openalex.org/W1484757099,"Abstract The influence of lead and calcium on the metabolism of a nuclear matrix protein has been studied in mouse neuroblastoma 2a (Nb2a) cells. This protein, p32/6.3, has an unusual distribution in that it is relatively abundant only in normal neural tissues and in intranuclear inclusion bodies induced in kidney tubule-lining cells of chronically lead-intoxicated animals (Egle, P. M., and Shelton, K. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 2294-2298). The mechanism(s) whereby lead increases p32/6.3 content are of interest, but its slow accumulation in intact animals over a period of weeks to months precludes studies with metabolic inhibitors. However, the enriched levels of p32/6.3 in mouse neuroblastoma 2a (Nb2a) cells permit these studies. The relative abundance of this protein was found to increase in mouse Nb2a cells after 1- and 3-day exposures to lead. This increase could be attributed to a decreased rate of degradation rather than either increased transcription or increased translation. A role for calcium in p32/6.3 regulation was also explored. Although neither increased extracellular calcium nor calcium ionophores had an effect, treatment of the cells with the calcium chelator [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid decreased p32/6.3 levels in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting a role for calcium in the normal metabolism of the protein."
