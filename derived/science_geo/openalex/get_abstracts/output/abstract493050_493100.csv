https://openalex.org/W2045187579,"We here describe a technique to transiently activate specific neural pathways in vivo. It comprises the combined use of a CRE-recombinase expressing canine adenovirus-2 (CAV-2) and an adeno-associated virus (AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry) that contains the floxed inverted sequence of the designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) hM3D(Gq)-mCherry. CAV-2 retrogradely infects projection neurons, which allowed us to specifically express hM3D(Gq)-mCherry in neurons that project from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (Acb), the majority of which were dopaminergic. Activation of hM3D(Gq)-mCherry by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) leads to increases in neuronal activity, which enabled us to specifically activate VTA to Acb projection neurons. The VTA to Acb pathway is part of the mesolimbic dopamine system and has been implicated in behavioral activation and the exertion of effort. Injections of all doses of CNO led to increases in progressive ratio (PR) performance. The effect of the lowest dose of CNO was suppressed by administration of a DRD1-antagonist, suggesting that CNO-induced increases in PR-performance are at least in part mediated by DRD1-signaling. We hereby validate the combined use of CAV-2 and DREADD-technology to activate specific neural pathways and determine consequent changes in behaviorally relevant paradigms."
https://openalex.org/W2168288078,"The taxonomic classification of the genus Vernonia Schreb is complex and, as yet, unclear. We here report the use of untargeted metabolomics approaches, followed by multivariate analyses methods and a phytochemical characterization of ten Vernonia species. Metabolic fingerprints were obtained by accurate mass measurements and used to determine the phytochemical similarities and differences between species through multivariate analyses approaches. Principal component analysis based on the relative levels of 528 metabolites, indicated that the ten species could be clustered into four groups. Thereby, V. polyanthes was the only species with presence of flavones chrysoeriol-7-O-glycuronyl, acacetin-7-O-glycuronyl and sesquiterpenes lactones piptocarphin A and piptocarphin B, while glaucolide A was detected in both V. brasiliana and V. polyanthes, separating these species from the two other species of the Vernonanthura group. Species from the Lessingianthus group were unique in showing a positive response in the foam test, suggesting the presence of saponins, which could be confirmed by metabolite annotation. V. rufogrisea showed a great variety of sesquiterpene lactones, placing this species into a separate group. Species within the Chrysolaena group were unique in accumulating clovamide. Our results of LC-MS-based profiling combined with multivariate analyses suggest that metabolomics approaches, such as untargeted LC-MS, may be potentially used as a large-scale chemotaxonomical tool, in addition to classical morphological and cytotaxonomical approaches, in order to facilitate taxonomical classifications."
https://openalex.org/W2056400855,"Astrocytes play active roles in the regulation of synaptic transmission. Neuronal excitation can evoke Ca(2+) transients in astrocytes, and these Ca(2+) transients can modulate neuronal excitability. Although only a subset of astrocytes appears to communicate with neurons, the types of astrocytes that can regulate neuronal excitability are poorly characterized. We found that ∼30% of astrocytes in the brain express transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), indicating that astrocytic subtypes can be classified on the basis of their expression patterns. When TRPV4(+) astrocytes are activated by ligands such as arachidonic acid, the activation propagates to neighboring astrocytes through gap junctions and by ATP release from the TRPV4(+) astrocytes. After activation, both TRPV4(+) and TRPV4(-) astrocytes release glutamate, which acts as an excitatory gliotransmitter to increase synaptic transmission through type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR). Our results indicate that TRPV4(+) astrocytes constitute a novel subtype of the population and are solely responsible for initiating excitatory gliotransmitter release to enhance synaptic transmission. We propose that TRPV4(+) astrocytes form a core of excitatory glial assembly in the brain and function to efficiently increase neuronal excitation in response to endogenous TRPV4 ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1984652255,"Endorepellin, the C-terminal fragment of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan, possesses angiostatic activity via dual receptor antagonism, through concurrent binding to the α2β1 integrin and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Here, we discovered that soluble endorepellin induced autophagy in endothelial cells by modulating the expression of Beclin 1, LC3, and p62, three established autophagic markers. Moreover, endorepellin evoked expression of the imprinted tumor suppressor gene Peg3 and its co-localization with Beclin 1 and LC3 in autophagosomes, suggesting a major role for this gene in endothelial cell autophagy. Mechanistically, endorepellin induced autophagy by down-regulating VEGFR2 via the two LG1/2 domains, whereas the C-terminal LG3 domain, the portion responsible for binding the α2β1 integrin, was ineffective. Endorepellin also induced transcriptional activity of the BECN1 promoter in endothelial cells, and the VEGFR2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, SU5416, blocked this effect. Finally, we found a correlation between endorepellin-evoked inhibition of capillary morphogenesis and enhanced autophagy. Thus, we have identified a new role for this endogenous angiostatic fragment in inducing autophagy through a VEGFR2-dependent but α2β1 integrin-independent pathway. This novel mechanism specifically targets endothelial cells and could represent a promising new strategy to potentiate the angiostatic effect of endorepellin and perhaps other angiostatic matrix proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2101957987,"Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is an essential regulator of gonadal function and fertility. Loss-of-function mutations in the FSHB/Fshb gene cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in humans and mice. Both gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and activins, members of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily, stimulate FSH synthesis; yet, their relative roles and mechanisms of action in vivo are unknown. Here, using conditional gene-targeting, we show that the canonical mediator of TGFβ superfamily signaling, SMAD4, is absolutely required for normal FSH synthesis in both male and female mice. Moreover, when the Smad4 gene is ablated in combination with its DNA binding cofactor Foxl2 in gonadotrope cells, mice make essentially no FSH and females are sterile. Indeed, the phenotype of these animals is remarkably similar to that of Fshb-knockout mice. Not only do these results establish SMAD4 and FOXL2 as essential master regulators of Fshb transcription in vivo, they also suggest that activins, or related ligands, could play more important roles in FSH synthesis than GnRH."
https://openalex.org/W2074369180,"NAD biosynthesis is of substantial interest because of its important roles in regulating various biological processes. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 3 (Nmnat3) is considered a mitochondria-localized NAD synthesis enzyme involved in de novo and salvage pathways. Although the biochemical properties of Nmnat3 are well documented, its physiological function in vivo remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that Nmnat3 was localized in the cytoplasm of mature erythrocytes and critically regulated their NAD pool. Deficiency of Nmnat3 in mice caused splenomegaly and hemolytic anemia, which was associated with the findings that Nmnat3-deficient erythrocytes had markedly lower ATP levels and shortened lifespans. However, the NAD level in other tissues were not apparently affected by the deficiency of Nmnat3. LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics revealed that the glycolysis pathway in Nmnat3-deficient erythrocytes was blocked at a glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) step because of the shortage of the coenzyme NAD. Stable isotope tracer analysis further demonstrated that deficiency of Nmnat3 resulted in glycolysis stall and a shift to the pentose phosphate pathway. Our findings indicate the critical roles of Nmnat3 in maintenance of the NAD pool in mature erythrocytes and the physiological impacts at its absence in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2005166795,"Recent work demonstrates that the MmpL (mycobacterial membrane protein large) transporters are dedicated to the export of mycobacterial lipids for cell wall biosynthesis. An MmpL transporter frequently works with an accessory protein, belonging to the MmpS (mycobacterial membrane protein small) family, to transport these key virulence factors. One such efflux system in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the MmpS5-MmpL5 transporter. The expression of MmpS5-MmpL5 is controlled by the MarR-like transcriptional regulator Rv0678, whose open reading frame is located downstream of the mmpS5-mmpL5 operon. To elucidate the structural basis of Rv0678 regulation, we have determined the crystal structure of this regulator, to 1.64 Å resolution, revealing a dimeric two-domain molecule with an architecture similar to members of the MarR family of transcriptional regulators. Rv0678 is distinct from other MarR regulators in that its DNA-binding and dimerization domains are clustered together. These two domains seemingly cooperate to bind an inducing ligand that we identified as 2-stearoylglycerol, which is a fatty acid glycerol ester. The structure also suggests that the conformational change leading to substrate-mediated derepression is primarily caused by a rigid body rotational motion of the entire DNA-binding domain of the regulator toward the dimerization domain. This movement results in a conformational state that is incompatible with DNA binding. We demonstrate using electrophoretic mobility shift assays that Rv0678 binds to the mmpS5-mmpL5, mmpS4-mmpL4, and the mmpS2-mmpL2 promoters. Binding by Rv0678 was reversed upon the addition of the ligand. These findings provide new insight into the mechanisms of gene regulation in the MarR family of regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2061143341,"The Gram-positive species Streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen causing severe local and life-threatening invasive diseases associated with high mortality rates and death. We demonstrated recently that pneumococcal endopeptidase O (PepO) is a ubiquitously expressed, multifunctional plasminogen and fibronectin-binding protein facilitating host cell invasion and evasion of innate immunity. In this study, we found that PepO interacts directly with the complement C1q protein, thereby attenuating the classical complement pathway and facilitating pneumococcal complement escape. PepO binds both free C1q and C1 complex in a dose-dependent manner based on ionic interactions. Our results indicate that recombinant PepO specifically inhibits the classical pathway of complement activation in both hemolytic and complement deposition assays. This inhibition is due to direct interaction of PepO with C1q, leading to a strong activation of the classical complement pathway, and results in consumption of complement components. In addition, PepO binds the classical complement pathway inhibitor C4BP, thereby regulating downstream complement activation. Importantly, pneumococcal surface-exposed PepO-C1q interaction mediates bacterial adherence to host epithelial cells. Taken together, PepO facilitates C1q-mediated bacterial adherence, whereas its localized release consumes complement as a result of its activation following binding of C1q, thus representing an additional mechanism of human complement escape by this versatile pathogen.

https://openalex.org/W2087861209,"GM1 gangliosidosis and Morquio B disease are autosomal recessive diseases caused by the defect in the lysosomal β-galactosidase (β-Gal), frequently related to misfolding and subsequent endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. Pharmacological chaperone (PC) therapy is a newly developed molecular therapeutic approach by using small molecule ligands of the mutant enzyme that are able to promote the correct folding and prevent endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and promote trafficking to the lysosome. In this report, we describe the enzymological properties of purified recombinant human β-Gal(WT) and two representative mutations in GM1 gangliosidosis Japanese patients, β-Gal(R201C) and β-Gal(I51T). We have also evaluated the PC effect of two competitive inhibitors of β-Gal. Moreover, we provide a detailed atomic view of the recognition mechanism of these compounds in comparison with two structurally related analogues. All compounds bind to the active site of β-Gal with the sugar-mimicking moiety making hydrogen bonds to active site residues. Moreover, the binding affinity, the enzyme selectivity, and the PC potential are strongly affected by the mono- or bicyclic structure of the core as well as the orientation, nature, and length of the exocyclic substituent. These results provide understanding on the mechanism of action of β-Gal selective chaperoning by newly developed PC compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2080588966,"Determining the molecular basis for target selectivity is of particular importance in drug discovery. The ideal antibiotic should be active against a broad spectrum of pathogenic organisms with a minimal effect on human targets. CG400549, a Staphylococcus-specific 2-pyridone compound that inhibits the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI), has recently been shown to possess human efficacy for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, which constitute a serious threat to human health. In this study, we solved the structures of three different FabI homologues in complex with several pyridone inhibitors, including CG400549. Based on these structures, we rationalize the 65-fold reduced affinity of CG400549 toward Escherichia coli versus S. aureus FabI and implement concepts to improve the spectrum of antibacterial activity. The identification of different conformational states along the reaction coordinate of the enzymatic hydride transfer provides an elegant visual depiction of the relationship between catalysis and inhibition, which facilitates rational inhibitor design. Ultimately, we developed the novel 4-pyridone-based FabI inhibitor PT166 that retained favorable pharmacokinetics and efficacy in a mouse model of S. aureus infection with extended activity against Gram-negative and mycobacterial organisms.

https://openalex.org/W1973222984,"Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels initiate action potentials in brain neurons and are primary therapeutic targets for anti-epileptic drugs controlling neuronal hyperexcitability in epilepsy. The molecular mechanisms underlying abnormal Nav channel expression, localization, and function during development of epilepsy are poorly understood but can potentially result from altered posttranslational modifications (PTMs). For example, phosphorylation regulates Nav channel gating, and has been proposed to contribute to acquired insensitivity to anti-epileptic drugs exhibited by Nav channels in epileptic neurons. However, whether changes in specific brain Nav channel PTMs occur acutely in response to seizures has not been established. Here, we show changes in PTMs of the major brain Nav channel, Nav1.2, after acute kainate-induced seizures. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses of Nav1.2 purified from the brains of control and seizure animals revealed a significant down-regulation of phosphorylation at nine sites, primarily located in the interdomain I-II linker, the region of Nav1.2 crucial for phosphorylation-dependent regulation of activity. Interestingly, Nav1.2 in the seizure samples contained methylated arginine (MeArg) at three sites. These MeArgs were adjacent to down-regulated sites of phosphorylation, and Nav1.2 methylation increased after seizure. Phosphorylation and MeArg were not found together on the same tryptic peptide, suggesting reciprocal regulation of these two PTMs. Coexpression of Nav1.2 with the primary brain arginine methyltransferase PRMT8 led to a surprising 3-fold increase in Nav1.2 current. Reciprocal regulation of phosphorylation and MeArg of Nav1.2 may underlie changes in neuronal Nav channel function in response to seizures and also contribute to physiological modulation of neuronal excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2007613020,"The biological role of the transcription factor GLI1 in the regulation of tumor growth is well established; however, the molecular events modulating this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism underlying the role of GLI1 as an effector of TGFβ signaling in the regulation of gene expression in cancer cells. TGFβ stimulates GLI1 activity in cancer cells and requires its transcriptional activity to induce BCL2 expression. Analysis of the mechanism regulating this interplay identified a new transcriptional complex including GLI1 and the TGFβ-regulated transcription factor, SMAD4. We demonstrate that SMAD4 physically interacts with GLI1 for concerted regulation of gene expression and cellular survival. Activation of the TGFβ pathway induces GLI1-SMAD4 complex binding to the BCL2 promoter whereas disruption of the complex through SMAD4 RNAi depletion impairs GLI1-mediated transcription of BCL2 and cellular survival. Further characterization demonstrated that SMAD2 and the histone acetyltransferase, PCAF, participate in this regulatory mechanism. Both proteins bind to the BCL2 promoter and are required for TGFβ- and GLI1-stimulated gene expression. Moreover, SMAD2/4 RNAi experiments showed that these factors are required for the recruitment of GLI1 to the BCL2 promoter. Finally, we determined whether this novel GLI1 transcriptional pathway could regulate other TGFβ targets. We found that two additional TGFβ-stimulated genes, INTERLEUKIN-7 and CYCLIN D1, are dependent upon the intact GLI1-SMAD-PCAF complex for transcriptional activation. Collectively, these results define a novel epigenetic mechanism that uses the transcription factor GLI1 and its associated complex as a central effector to regulate gene expression in cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2045116801,"The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells may perform a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disease. AMPK additionally exerts several salutary effects on vascular function and improves vascular abnormalities. The current study sought to determine whether sodium tanshinone IIA silate (STS) has an inhibitory effect on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration under high glucose conditions mimicking diabetes without dyslipidemia, and establish the underlying mechanism. In this study, STS promoted the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) at T172 in VSMCs. VSMC proliferation was enhanced under high glucose (25 mM glucose, HG) versus normal glucose conditions (5.5 mM glucose, NG), and this increase was inhibited significantly by STS treatment. We utilized western blotting analysis to evaluate the effects of STS on cell-cycle regulatory proteins and found that STS increased the expression of p53 and the Cdk inhibitor, p21, subsequent decreased the expression of cell cycle-associated protein, cyclin D1. We further observed that STS arrested cell cycle progression at the G0/G1 phase. Additionally, expression and enzymatic activity of MMP-2, translocation of NF-κB, as well as VSMC migration were suppressed in the presence of STS. Notably, Compound C (CC), a specific inhibitor of AMPK, as well as AMPK siRNA blocked STS-mediated inhibition of VSMC proliferation and migration. We further evaluated its potential for activating AMPK in aortas in animal models of type 2 diabetes and found that Oral administration of STS for 10 days resulted in activation of AMPK in aortas from ob/ob or db/db mice. In conclusion, STS inhibits high glucose-induced VSMC proliferation and migration, possibly through AMPK activation. The growth suppression effect may be attributable to activation of AMPK-p53-p21 signaling, and the inhibitory effect on migration to the AMPK/NF-κB signaling axis."
https://openalex.org/W1969175350,"EGCG possesses the ability of disaggregating the existing amyloid fibrils which were associated with many age-related degenerative diseases. However, the molecular mechanism of EGCG to disaggregate these fibrils is poorly known. In this work, to study the influence of EGCG on the full-length human islet amyloid polypeptide 1–37 (hIAPP1–37) oligomers, molecular dynamics simulations of hIAPP1–37 pentamer and decamer with EGCG were performed, respectively. The obtained results indicate that EGCG indeed destabilized the hIAPP1–37 oligomers. The nematic order parameter and secondary structure calculations coupled with the free-energy landscape indicate that EGCG broke the initial ordered pattern of two polymers, greatly reduced their β-sheet content and enlarged their conformational space. On this basis, three possible target sites were identified with the binding capacity order of S1>S2>S3. After a deeper analysis of each site, we found that S1 was the most possible site on which residues B-Ile26/Ala25, A-Phe23, B/C-Leu27 and E-Tyr37 played an important role for their binding. The proposal of this molecular mechanism can not only provide a prospective interaction figure between EGCG and β-sheet-rich fibrils of hIAPP1–37, but also is useful for further discovering other potential inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2067383726,"The agents of cryptococcosis C. neoformans and C. gattii are important agents of meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts, respectively. They are grouped into eight major molecular types, VNI-VNIV for C. neoformans and VGI-VGIV for C. gattii. These major molecular types differ in their host range, epidemiology, antifungal susceptibility and geographic distribution. To enable a rapid identification of the major molecular types and potential hybrids within the two species specific probes based on the PLB1 gene in combination with hyperbranched rolling circle amplification (HRCA) were developed. HRCA was applied to 76 cryptococcal strains, 10 strains each representing the 7 haploid major molecular types, 4 VNIII hybrid strains and 2 inter-species hybrid strains. All strains were correctly identified to the major molecular type and or hybrid type using HRCA alone. To increase the sensitivity a semi-nested PCR step was developed, which will enable the identification of the molecular types/hybrids directly from clinical samples, harboring a low copy number of DNA (40 copies). Thus, HRCA based on the PLB1 locus alone and in combination with a semi-nested PCR showed to be a specific and sensitive methodology, with a great potential to be used on clinical specimens for the direct diagnosis of the agents of cryptococcosis, including hybrid strains, enabling a rapid and patient tailored treatment choice of this disease."

https://openalex.org/W2071870633,"Background Abnormal intrathecal synthesis of IgG, reflected by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oligoclonal IgG bands (OBs) and increased IgG index, is much less frequently observed in Japanese multiple sclerosis (MS) cohorts compared with Western cohorts. We aimed to clarify whether genetic and common infectious backgrounds influence CSF IgG abnormality in Japanese MS patients. Methodology We analyzed HLA-DRB1 alleles, and IgG antibodies against Chlamydia pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) in 94 patients with MS and 367 unrelated healthy controls (HCs). We defined CSF IgG abnormality as the presence of CSF OBs and/or increased IgG index (>0.658). Principal Findings CSF IgG abnormality was found in 59 of 94 (62.8%) MS patients. CSF IgG abnormality-positive patients had a significantly higher frequency of brain MRI lesions meeting the Barkhof criteria compared with abnormality-negative patients. Compared with HCs, CSF IgG abnormality-positive MS patients showed a significantly higher frequency of DRB1*1501, whereas CSF IgG abnormality-negative patients had a significantly higher frequency of DRB1*0405. CSF IgG abnormality-positive MS patients had a significantly higher frequency of anti-C. pneumoniae IgG antibodies compared with CSF IgG abnormality-negative MS patients, although there was no difference in the frequency of anti-C. pneumoniae IgG antibodies between HCs and total MS patients. Compared with HCs, anti-H. pylori IgG antibodies were detected significantly less frequently in the total MS patients, especially in CSF IgG abnormality-negative MS patients. The frequencies of antibodies against EBNA and VZV did not differ significantly among the groups. Conclusions CSF IgG abnormality is associated with Western MS-like brain MRI features. DRB1*1501 and C. pneumoniae infection confer CSF IgG abnormality, while DRB1*0405 and H. pylori infection are positively and negatively associated with CSF IgG abnormality-negative MS, respectively, suggesting that genetic and environmental factors differentially contribute to MS susceptibility according to the CSF IgG abnormality status."
https://openalex.org/W2073913365,"Most individuals with Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) are homozygous for an expanded GAA triplet repeat (GAA-TR) mutation in intron 1 of the FXN gene, which results in deficiency of FXN transcript. Consistent with the expanded GAA-TR sequence as a cause of variegated gene silencing, evidence for heterochromatin has been detected in intron 1 in the immediate vicinity of the expanded GAA-TR mutation in FRDA. Transcriptional deficiency in FRDA is thought to result from deficient elongation through the expanded GAA-TR sequence because of repeat-proximal heterochromatin and abnormal DNA structures adopted by the expanded repeat. There is also evidence for deficient transcriptional initiation in FRDA, but its relationship to the expanded GAA-TR mutation remains unclear. We show that repressive chromatin extends from the expanded GAA-TR in intron 1 to the upstream regions of the FXN gene, involving the FXN transcriptional start site. Using a chromatin accessibility assay and a high-resolution nucleosome occupancy assay, we found that the major FXN transcriptional start site, which is normally in a nucleosome-depleted region, is rendered inaccessible by altered nucleosome positioning in FRDA. Consistent with the altered epigenetic landscape the FXN gene promoter, a typical CpG island promoter, was found to be in a transcriptionally non-permissive state in FRDA. Both metabolic labeling of nascent transcripts and an unbiased whole transcriptome analysis revealed a severe deficiency of transcriptional initiation in FRDA. Deficient transcriptional initiation, and not elongation, is the major cause of FXN transcriptional deficiency in FRDA, and it is related to the spread of repressive chromatin from the expanded GAA-TR mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1965905772,"During free-viewing of natural scenes, eye movements are guided by bottom-up factors inherent to the stimulus, as well as top-down factors inherent to the observer. The question of how these two different sources of information interact and contribute to fixation behavior has recently received a lot of attention. Here, a battery of 15 visual stimulus features was used to quantify the contribution of stimulus properties during free-viewing of 4 different categories of images (Natural, Urban, Fractal and Pink Noise). Behaviorally relevant information was estimated in the form of topographical interestingness maps by asking an independent set of subjects to click at image regions that they subjectively found most interesting. Using a Bayesian scheme, we computed saliency functions that described the probability of a given feature to be fixated. In the case of stimulus features, the precise shape of the saliency functions was strongly dependent upon image category and overall the saliency associated with these features was generally weak. When testing multiple features jointly, a linear additive integration model of individual saliencies performed satisfactorily. We found that the saliency associated with interesting locations was much higher than any low-level image feature and any pair-wise combination thereof. Furthermore, the low-level image features were found to be maximally salient at those locations that had already high interestingness ratings. Temporal analysis showed that regions with high interestingness ratings were fixated as early as the third fixation following stimulus onset. Paralleling these findings, fixation durations were found to be dependent mainly on interestingness ratings and to a lesser extent on the low-level image features. Our results suggest that both low- and high-level sources of information play a significant role during exploration of complex scenes with behaviorally relevant information being more effective compared to stimulus features."

Expression of GEF-H1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, ECM proteins fibronectin and collagen, lysyl oxidase (LOX) activity, interleukin-8 and activation of Rho signaling were analyzed in lung samples and pulmonary EC grown on soft (1.5 or 2.8 kPa) and stiff (40 kPa) substrates. LPS induced EC inflammatory activation accompanied by expression of ECM proteins, increase in LOX activity, and activation of Rho signaling. These effects were augmented in EC grown on stiff substrate. Stiffness-dependent enhancement of inflammation was associated with increased expression of Rho activator, GEF-H1. Inhibition of ECM crosslinking and stiffening by LOX suppression reduced EC inflammatory activation and GEF-H1 expression in response to LPS. In vivo, LOX inhibition attenuated LPS-induced expression of GEF-H1 and lung dysfunction. These findings present a novel mechanism of stiffness-dependent exacerbation of vascular inflammation and escalation of ALI via stimulation of GEF-H1 - Rho pathway. This pathway represents a fundamental mechanism of positive feedback regulation of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2075948539,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly lethal brain tumor. Due to resistance to current therapies, patient prognosis remains poor and development of novel and effective GBM therapy is crucial. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) have gained attention as a therapeutic target in GBM due to their relative resistance to current therapies and potent tumor-initiating ability. Previously, we identified that the mitotic kinase maternal embryonic leucine-zipper kinase (MELK) is highly expressed in GBM tissues, specifically in GSCs, and its expression is inversely correlated with the post-surgical survival period of GBM patients. In addition, patient-derived GSCs depend on MELK for their survival and growth both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we demonstrate evidence that the role of MELK in the GSC survival is specifically dependent on its kinase activity. With in silico structure-based analysis for protein-compound interaction, we identified the small molecule Compound 1 (C1) is predicted to bind to the kinase-active site of MELK protein. Elimination of MELK kinase activity was confirmed by in vitro kinase assay in nano-molar concentrations. When patient-derived GSCs were treated with C1, they underwent mitotic arrest and subsequent cellular apoptosis in vitro, a phenotype identical to that observed with shRNA-mediated MELK knockdown. In addition, C1 treatment strongly induced tumor cell apoptosis in slice cultures of GBM surgical specimens and attenuated growth of mouse intracranial tumors derived from GSCs in a dose-dependent manner. Lastly, C1 treatment sensitizes GSCs to radiation treatment. Collectively, these data indicate that targeting MELK kinase activity is a promising approach to attenuate GBM growth by eliminating GSCs in tumors."

As a proteasomal substrate, MBP reveals a distinct and physiologically relevant concentration range for ubiquitin-independent proteolysis. Enzymatic deimination prevents hydrolysis of MBP by the proteasome, suggesting that an abnormally basic charge contributes to its susceptibility toward proteasome-mediated degradation.

https://openalex.org/W1982922462,"(pro)MMP-9 binds to CLL cells through the PEX9 domain and contributes to CLL progression. To biochemically characterize this interaction and identify potential therapeutic targets, we prepared GST-PEX9 forms containing structural blades B1B2 or B3B4. We recently described a sequence in blade B4 (P3 sequence) that bound α4β1 integrin and partially impaired cell adhesion and migration. We have now studied the possible contribution of the B1B2 region to cell interaction with PEX9. CLL cells bound to GST-B1B2 and CD44 was the primary receptor. GST-B1B2 inhibited CLL cell migration as effectively as GST-B3B4. Overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the B1B2 region identified the sequence FDAIAEIGNQLYLFKDGKYW, present in B1 and contained in peptide P6, as the most effective site. P6 inhibited cell adhesion to PEX9 in a dose-dependent manner and with an IC50 value of 90 μM. P6 also inhibited cell adhesion to hyaluronan but had no effect on adhesion to VCAM-1 (α4β1 integrin ligand), confirming its specific interaction with CD44. Spatial localization analyses mapped P6 to the central cavity of PEX9, in close proximity to the previously identified P3 sequence. Both P6 and P3 equally impaired cell adhesion to (pro)MMP-9. Moreover, P6 synergistically cooperated with P3, resulting in complete inhibition of CLL cell binding to PEX9, chemotaxis, and transendothelial migration. Thus, P6 is a novel sequence in PEX9 involved in cell-PEX9/(pro)MMP-9 binding by interacting with CD44. Targeting both sites, P6 and P3, should efficiently prevent (pro)MMP-9 binding to CLL cells and its pathological consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2000242111,"The variable domain of camelid heavy chain antibody (VHH) is highly heat-resistant and is therefore ideal for many applications. Although understanding the process of heat-induced irreversible denaturation is essential to improve the efficacy of VHH, its inactivation mechanism remains unclear. Here, we showed that chemical modifications predominantly governed the irreversible denaturation of VHH at high temperatures. After heat treatment, the activity of VHH was dependent only on the incubation time at 90 °C and was insensitive to the number of heating (90 °C)-cooling (20 °C) cycles, indicating a negligible role for folding/unfolding intermediates on permanent denaturation. The residual activity was independent of concentration; therefore, VHH lost its activity in a unimolecular manner, not by aggregation. A VHH mutant lacking Asn, which is susceptible to chemical modifications, had significantly higher heat resistance than did the wild-type protein, indicating the importance of chemical modifications to VHH denaturation."
https://openalex.org/W2070001116,"Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine the optimum vitamin D2 synthesis conditions in oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus). Ultraviolet B (UV-B) was selected as the most efficient irradiation source for the preliminary experiment, in addition to the levels of three independent variables, which included ambient temperature (25-45°C), exposure time (40-120 min), and irradiation intensity (0.6-1.2 W/m2). The statistical analysis indicated that, for the range which was studied, irradiation intensity was the most critical factor that affected vitamin D2 synthesis in oyster mushrooms. Under optimal conditions (ambient temperature of 28.16°C, UV-B intensity of 1.14 W/m2, and exposure time of 94.28 min), the experimental vitamin D2 content of 239.67 µg/g (dry weight) was in very good agreement with the predicted value of 245.49 µg/g, which verified the practicability of this strategy. Compared to fresh mushrooms, the lyophilized mushroom powder can synthesize remarkably higher level of vitamin D2 (498.10 µg/g) within much shorter UV-B exposure time (10 min), and thus should receive attention from the food processing industry."
https://openalex.org/W2018040060,"Glucokinase (GK), the hexokinase involved in glucose sensing in pancreatic β cells, is also expressed in hypothalamic tanycytes, which cover the ventricular walls of the basal hypothalamus and are implicated in an indirect control of neuronal activity by glucose. Previously, we demonstrated that GK was preferentially localized in tanycyte nuclei in euglycemic rats, which has been reported in hepatocytes and is suggestive of the presence of the GK regulatory protein, GKRP. In the present study, GK intracellular localization in hypothalamic and hepatic tissues of the same rats under several glycemic conditions was compared using confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis. In the hypothalamus, increased GK nuclear localization was observed in hyperglycemic conditions; however, it was primarily localized in the cytoplasm in hepatic tissue under the same conditions. Both GK and GKRP were next cloned from primary cultures of tanycytes. Expression of GK by Escherichia coli revealed a functional cooperative protein with a S0.5 of 10 mM. GKRP, expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inhibited GK activity in vitro with a Ki 0.2 µM. We also demonstrated increased nuclear reactivity of both GK and GKRP in response to high glucose concentrations in tanycyte cultures. These data were confirmed using Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts. Results indicate that GK undergoes short-term regulation by nuclear compartmentalization. Thus, in tanycytes, GK can act as a molecular switch to arrest cellular responses to increased glucose."
https://openalex.org/W2136406078,"Postprandial hypoglycemia is a complication following gastric bypass surgery, which frequently remains undetected. Severe hypoglycemic episodes, however, put patients at risk, e.g., for syncope. A major cause of hypoglycemia following gastric bypass is hyperinsulinemic nesidioblastosis. Since pancreatic islets in nesidioblastosis overexpress insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor α and administration of recombinant IGF-1 provokes hypoglycemia, our main objective was to investigate the occurrence of post-load hypoglycemia one year after bariatric surgery and its relation to pre- and post-operative IGF-1 serum concentrations. We evaluated metabolic parameters including 2 h 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and measured IGF-1 serum concentration in thirty-six non-diabetic patients (29 f/7 m), aged 41.3±2.0 y with a median (IQR) BMI of 30.9 kg/m2 (27.5-34.3 kg/m2), who underwent elective bariatric surgery (predominantly gastric bypass, 83%) at our hospital. Post-load hypoglycemia as defined by a 2 h glucose concentration <60 mg/dl was detected in 50% of patients. Serum insulin and C-peptide concentration during the OGTT and HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance) were similar in hypoglycemic and euglycemic patients. Strikingly, pre- and post-operative serum IGF-1 concentrations were significantly higher in hypoglycemic patients (p = 0.012 and p = 0.007 respectively). IGF-1 serum concentration before surgery negatively correlated with 2 h glucose concentration during the OGTT (rho = -0.58, p = 0.0003). Finally, IGF-1 serum concentrations before and after surgery significantly predicted post-load hypoglycemia with odds ratios of 1.28 (95%CI:1.03-1.55, p = 0.029) and 1.18 (95%CI:1.03-1.33, p = 0.015), respectively, for each 10 ng/ml increment. IGF-1 serum concentration could be a valuable biomarker to identify patients at risk for hypoglycemia following bariatric surgery independently of a diagnostic OGTT. Thus, IGF-1 testing could help to prevent a significant complication of gastric bypass surgery."
https://openalex.org/W1985199742,"Injured peripheral neurons successfully activate intrinsic signaling pathways to enable axon regeneration. We have previously shown that dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons activate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway following injury and that this activity enhances their axon growth capacity. mTOR plays a critical role in protein synthesis, but the mTOR-dependent proteins enhancing the regenerative capacity of DRG neurons remain unknown. To identify proteins whose expression is regulated by injury in an mTOR-dependent manner, we analyzed the protein composition of DRGs from mice in which we genetically activated mTOR and from mice with or without a prior nerve injury. Quantitative label-free mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the injury effects were correlated with mTOR activation. We identified a member of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) family of proteins, syntaxin13, whose expression was increased by injury in an mTOR-dependent manner.

Given the importance of protein synthesis for axon regeneration, here we used a mass spectrometry approach to identify proteins whose expression is regulated by injury in an mTOR-dependent manner and to play a role in regenerative growth. We analyzed the protein composition of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons from mice in which we genetically activated mTOR and from control mice with or without a prior injury. Using semiquantitative proteomics, we show that the effect of injury correlates with the effect of genetic mTOR activation. We identified syntaxin13 as a protein whose expression is increased by injury in an mTOR-dependent manner. Syntaxin13 is an integral membrane protein belonging to the t-SNARE family, a group of proteins involved in membrane fusion. Syntaxin13 plays a role in endosomal recycling of plasma membrane constituents (11Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H.

We found that syntaxin13 levels were locally enhanced in the injured nerve via local protein synthesis, and knockdown of syntaxin13 in cultured DRG neurons markedly reduced axon growth and regeneration. Together, these data suggest that mTOR activity enhances syntaxin13 expression in injured nerves to promote axon regeneration. The following antibodies were used: anti-tuberin/TSC2 (C terminus, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-α-tubulin (Abcam); anti-syntaxin13 (Synaptic Systems); anti-phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein (serine 240/244, Cell Signaling), and anti-APP (N terminus, Millipore).

To knock down syntaxin13 without targeting recombinant GFP-syntaxin13, we used a mouse shRNA sequence targeting the syntaxin13 3′UTR (CCTGGCTTTGATGGCAAGATT). shRNA lentivirus was produced using pLKO.1 constructs from The RNAi Consortium following the manufacturer's manual. For experiments involving wild-type animals, C57B6 6–9-month-old females were used. TSC2 conditional knockouts were obtained by crossing Tsc2flox/flox animals with AdvillinCre/Cre, as described previously (6Abe N. Borson S.H. Gambello M.J. Wang F. Cavalli V.

Chem. 2010; 285: 28034-28043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Genotypes were confirmed by tail PCR at weaning age. Littermate controls were used for all experiments. All surgical procedures were approved by the Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine Animal Studies Committee. Sciatic nerve injury experiments were performed as described previously (15Cho Y. Cavalli V. HDAC5 is a novel injury-regulated tubulin deacetylase controlling axon regeneration.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 3063-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sciatic nerves of mice were ligated unilaterally at the midpoint, and mice were sacrificed at the indicated time after surgery. Rapamycin was delivered by intraperitoneal injection at 5 mg/kg body weight. Rapamycin was dissolved in 200 μl of DMEM from a 10 mg/ml stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide. An equivalent volume of dimethyl sulfoxide was dissolved into 200 μl of DMEM for vehicle control. Intraperitoneal injection was performed 1 h before sciatic nerve ligation. Animals were sacrificed, and DRGs and nerves were dissected 24 h following ligation. For other chemical treatments, sciatic nerves were soaked with chemicals dissolved in DMSO in Surgifoam (Johnson & Johnson) 30 min prior to injury as described (15Cho Y. Cavalli V. HDAC5 is a novel injury-regulated tubulin deacetylase controlling axon regeneration.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 3063-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Drug concentrations were as follows: cycloheximide, 1 mm, 100 μl; nocodazole, 0.33 mm, 100 μl. For biochemical studies on DRG cell bodies, L4 and L5 DRGs were dissected from both the injured side and the control contralateral uninjured side. For biochemistry on the sciatic nerve, equal lengths (3 mm) of the proximal and distal parts were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) with phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 1 and 2 (Invitrogen). DRGs were also lysed in this buffer. Equal protein amounts (10 μg) were loaded and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. For immunohistochemistry, mouse sciatic nerves were dissected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h, incubated overnight in 30% sucrose in PBS, embedded in OCT solution (Tissue-Tek), and frozen in dry ice-cooled methylbutane. Longitudinal sections of fixed sciatic nerves were stained with syntaxin13 antibodies. Protein samples (5 μg) of DRG extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie, and the gel lanes were then sliced into nine different pieces. Each gel piece was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed using the LC-MS/MS method on an Orbitrap XL instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany), interfaced with a NanoAcquity LC system (Waters). Survey scans were acquired in the Orbitrap MS using a mass resolution of 60,000. Six MS/MS scans were acquired in the ion trap for each survey scan. Peptide identification was obtained by use of an in-house Protein Prospector search engine (16Chalkley R.J. Baker P.R. Medzihradszky K.F. Lynn A.J. Burlingame A.L.

The search parameters included the following: enzyme specificity = trypsin; allowed missed cleavages = 1; fixed modification = carbamidomethylation; variable modifications = acetylation on protein N terminus, glutamine on peptide N-terminal to glutamic acid, methionine loss from protein N terminus, methionine loss from protein N terminus and acetylation, methionine oxidation, serine and threonine phosphorylation; maximal number of variable modifications = 2; parent mass tolerance = 20 ppm; fragment mass tolerance = 0.6 Da; peptide expectation cutoff = 0.05. The match of the decoy database sequences indicated that the false discovery rate for the expectation cutoff value is about 0.09%. Label-free quantification was performed using an extracted ion chromatogram algorithm. We adapted a label-free quantification portion of a data processing pipeline developed for protein turnover studies (18Guan S. Price J.C. Prusiner S.B. Ghaemmaghami S. Burlingame A.L. A data processing pipeline for mammalian proteome dynamics studies using stable isotope metabolic labeling.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10 (M111.010728)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For particular peptides of interest, manual extraction of ion chromatograms was performed using the instrument software (Xcalibur from ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Proteomic data were further analyzed using hierarchic cluster analyses via Euclidean metrics for distance assessment and Ward minimum variance for linkage (19Salvador, S., Chan, P., (2004) Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 576–584, Washington, D. C.Google Scholar, 20MacKay D.J.C. Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms. Cambridge University Press, 2003: 284-310Google Scholar). For subclustering reasons, we used an average linkage algorithm. Amalgamation curves were employed to estimate cluster number and to supervise reclustering. At each step of the hierarchic clustering, the data were validated using the root mean square deviation of the cluster, and pseudo-F ratio, pseudo T-square estimation, and Dunn's cluster separation maximum group assessment methods. For gene ontology, we used the David bioinformatics server tool with the following parameters: medium classification stringency, κ similarity = 3; final group membership of at least 3; and enrichment threshold 1.0; out of 9 gene ontology clusters revealed, four clusters satisfied the 1.0 enrichment threshold (vesicle associate protein, score 3.19; nucleotide biosynthesis-related cluster, score 1.66; endoplasmic reticulum-associated proteins, score 1.16; nucleotide-binding proteins, score 1.09); however, only the first cluster, vesicle associate protein, met the false discovery rate threshold 5% requirement analysis. Mouse embryonic DRG spot cultures, in vitro axotomy, and regeneration assays were performed as described previously (15Cho Y. Cavalli V. HDAC5 is a novel injury-regulated tubulin deacetylase controlling axon regeneration.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 3063-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryonic E13.5 DRGs were dissociated and plated in a defined region with 104 cells/2.5 μl. Culture medium was added 10 min after plating. DRG neurons were axotomized using a blade (FST, 10035-10) at DIV7. For determination of syntaxin13 levels in injured axons, vehicle or cycloheximide was applied for 1 h prior to axotomy, and DRG neurons were fixed and stained for βIII-tubulin and syntaxin13 3 h after axotomy. The ratio of fluorescence intensity between syntaxin13 and βIII-tubulin was measured using ImageJ. For in vitro regeneration assay, DRG neurons were fixed 0 or 40 h after axotomy and stained for βIII-tubulin. Axons were visualized by fluorescence with a ×10 objective (Nikon, TE2000E). A regeneration index was calculated from the images acquired 40 h post axotomy (15Cho Y. Cavalli V. HDAC5 is a novel injury-regulated tubulin deacetylase controlling axon regeneration.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 3063-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fluorescence intensity of a square area (2.7 × 0.1 mm) at 0.1 mm distal to the axotomy line was measured and normalized to the similar area 0.1 mm proximal to the axotomy line. The number of regenerating axons crossing the axotomy line was measured using ImageJ. Western blots were scanned and quantified by ImageJ, and the t test was used for statistical analysis. For multiple comparisons, analysis of variance followed by Tukey tests and t tests were used. Previously, we showed that DRG neurons activate mTOR following injury, and this activity enhances axon growth capacity (6Abe N. Borson S.H. Gambello M.J. Wang F. Cavalli V.

Genetic up-regulation of mTOR activity by deletion of the negative regulator TSC2 in DRGs is sufficient to enhance axon growth capacity (6Abe N. Borson S.H. Gambello M.J. Wang F. Cavalli V.

It seems likely that the mTOR pathway regulates the translation of a number of other proteins to maximize axon growth capacity. Hence, to identify proteins associated with regenerative growth, we compared the DRG proteome from mice in which we genetically activated mTOR in DRG neurons or from mice that received a sciatic nerve injury 4 days prior to DRG dissection. In theory, the potential convergence of an injury-related signaling pathway on mTOR activation should create similar protein expression patterns in naive neurons lacking TSC2 and injured WT neurons. To genetically activate mTOR in DRG neurons, we deleted TSC2 in sensory neurons by crossing Tsc2flox/flox mice to AdvillinCre/Cre, generating Tsc2flox/flox;AdvillinCre/+ conditional knock-out animals, hereafter referred to as TSC2KO (6Abe N. Borson S.H. Gambello M.J. Wang F. Cavalli V. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation increases axonal growth capacity of injured peripheral nerves.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28034-28043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Injury-induced activation of mTOR in wild-type (WT) mice was achieved by performing a sciatic nerve ligation 4 days prior to DRG dissection. We chose this time point because 4 days is sufficient to promote the conditioning injury effect as well as to enhance axon growth capacity (6Abe N. Borson S.H. Gambello M.J. Wang F. Cavalli V. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation increases axonal growth capacity of injured peripheral nerves.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28034-28043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We then prepared DRG extracts, separated proteins by SDS-PAGE, and performed in-gel digest with trypsin. Peptides were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS. Approximately 2700 proteins were identified in each sample. We performed automated label-free quantification by using the mean peak area ratio as a measure of relative protein abundance. We then conducted correlative and cluster analyses between protein expression patterns in TSC2KO versus noninjured WT (WT−), as well as in injured WT (WT+) versus WT−. Because mass spectrometry analysis identified different numbers of proteins in WT−, TSC2KO, and WT+ groups, we retained only those proteins that were detected in both analytical groups for evaluation, leading to 236 proteins for each group. Analysis of the standard deviation distribution profile for each protein indicated that there were less than 5% outliers beyond two standard deviations for the proteins found in all groups. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a prominent all point positive correlation between the evaluated groups (r = 0.6) that was reflected in an all point histogram and corresponding probability density functions (Fig. 1A). Per point analyses revealed significant deviations between protein expression patterns in WT+/WT− and TSC2KO/WT− groups (Fig. 1B). Hierarchic clustering analysis was then conducted to pinpoint the proteins exhibiting the highest similarity in expression pattern between WT+/WT− and TSC2KO/WT− (Fig. 1C). Using this strategy, 10 clusters were enriched, which passed validation algorithms for the hierarchic clustering approach. Most of the clusters revealed a similar behavior pattern, and the resemblance was particularly prominent for clusters 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9. To further decrease the list of proteins being up- and down-regulated in a similar fashion between WT+/WT− and TSC2KO/WT− pairs, we set a threshold of ±0.5-fold logarithmic scale change (base of 2). This threshold corresponded to about 41% up-regulation and 29% down-regulation of protein expression in WT+/WT− and TSC2KO/WT− pairs. These magnitudes of change were found to be statistically significant using one sample one tail t test analysis. Thirty five down-regulated proteins (clusters 1, 3, and 4; Table 1) and 23 up-regulated proteins (clusters 6, 7, and 8; Table 2) passed the threshold of log2(protein ratio) = ±0.5. Further re-clustering of the down-regulated proteins revealed four subclusters with a high similarity of behavior in subclusters 1 and 3 (Fig. 1E). Re-clustering of the up-regulated proteins revealed the existence of two uneven sized clusters (Fig. 1D).TABLE 1List of down-regulated proteinsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab TABLE 2List of up-regulated proteinsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Although most clusters failed to be enriched to a specific gene ontology category, one down-regulated protein subcluster exhibited functional association with vesicle turnover impairment. Furthermore, we found that the expression of RhoA, a small GTPase known for its role in growth cone collapse and outgrowth failure (21Kopp M.A. Liebscher T. Niedeggen A. Laufer S. Brommer B. Jungehulsing G.J. Strittmatter S.M. Dirnagl U. Schwab J.M. Small-molecule-induced Rho-inhibition: NSAIDs after spinal cord injury.Cell Tissue Res. 2012; 349: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), was down-regulated in both WT+/WT− and TSC2KO/WT− comparison groups. Analysis of the up-regulated proteins showed that the enhancement of protein expression was very limited in both WT+/WT− and TSC2KO/WT− comparison groups. This relatively limited enhancement in protein expression could result from the complexity of DRG tissue, containing neurons and non-neuronal cells as well as connective tissue, which decreases the sensitivity of our proteomics analysis and thus limit the identification of low abundant neuronal protein. Nevertheless, a close analysis of two enriched clusters in the up-regulated proteins groups revealed that two proteins, the SNARE protein syntaxin13 and superoxide dismutase, were increased in both WT+/WT− and TSC2KO/WT− comparison groups. This analysis indicates that genetic activation of mTOR leads to changes in protein expression in DRG that partially overlap with those induced by a prior nerve injury. We decided to focus our study on syntaxin13 because this protein plays a role in neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (13Hirling H. Steiner P. Chaperon C. Marsault R. Regazzi R. Catsicas S. Syntaxin 13 is a developmentally regulated SNARE involved in neurite outgrowth and endosomal trafficking.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, syntaxin13 localizes to the recycling endosome, a vesicular compartment that has been shown to contribute to neurite outgrowth and axon regeneration (22Sann S. Wang Z. Brown H. Jin Y.

Endocytosis and endosomes at the crossroads of regulating trafficking of axon outgrowth-modifying receptors.Traffic. 2011; 12: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, the gene ontology cluster analysis revealed that the vesicle associate protein group was enriched and met the false discovery rate threshold 5% requirement analysis. Syntaxin13 (molecular mass of ∼37 kDa), also known as syntaxin12 (accession number Q9ER00, gene name stx12) (Fig. 1D), was identified based on two peptides (LM(oxidation)NDFSSALNNFQVVQR m/z = 999.9886 z = 2, and its charged state z = 3, and ISQATAQIK m/z = 480.280 z = 2) derived from tryptic digestion of proteins extracted from gel slices corresponding to 25–37 kDa. The peptide quantification used for the data analysis described above revealed a peak area ratio of 2.34 in KO/WT− pair, suggesting an ∼2-fold increase in syntaxin13 levels in KO mice compared with WT. To validate the proteomic quantification, we analyzed syntaxin13 expression levels in neurons lacking TSC2 using a biochemical approach. We probed for syntaxin13 levels in DRG cell bodies from WT and TSC2KO mice by Western blot. The level of syntaxin13 was normalized to total α-tubulin (Fig. 2A). Extracts were also analyzed for TSC2 to test for the absence of TSC2 in TSC2KO DRG cell bodies (Fig. 2A). In TSC2KO mice, DRG cell bodies displayed about a 2-fold increase in syntaxin13 levels compared with WT (Fig. 2, A and B), consistent with our mass spectrometry analysis. We also analyzed extracts of sciatic nerve, in which DRG neurons project their axons. A residual level of TSC2 can be observed in the nerve (Fig. 2C), probably due to the presence of other cells, including Schwann cells. Similarly to the DRG cell bodies, we observed an ∼2-fold increase in syntaxin13 levels. Because mTOR is genetically activated specifically in sensory neurons (6Abe N. Borson S.H. Gambello M.J. Wang F. Cavalli V. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation increases axonal growth capacity of injured peripheral nerves.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28034-28043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the observed increase in syntaxin13 levels occurs in sensory axons. Using the same biochemical approach, we then validated whether nerve injury increases syntaxin13 levels in WT DRG neurons. In contrast to the mass spectrometry data, which suggested an ∼2-fold increase in syntaxin13 levels in injured WT compared with uninjured WT, we observed no significant change in syntaxin13 levels in WT DRG cell bodies following sciatic nerve injury at the four time points tested (Fig. 3, A and B). This apparent discrepancy could result from a proteomic quantification based on two peptides only. However, we observed that syntaxin13 levels increas"

Combinatorial approaches to antibody discovery have facilitated access to unique antibodies by surpassing the diversity limitations of the natural repertoire, exploitation of immune repertoires from multiple species, and tailoring selections to isolate antibodies with desirable biophysical attributes.

Antibodies are natural components of the vertebrate immune system produced by B-cells and function to identify foreign or “non-self” molecules. Due to their exquisite specificity, tune-able affinity, potency, stability, and ease of manufacturability antibodies have enjoyed enormous successes. The pharmaceutical industry has invested heavily in antibody-based therapeutics with 34 antibodies or antibody fragments approved worldwide, 28 of which are approved in both European and United States markets (1Reichert J.M. Marketed therapeutic antibodies compendium.MAbs. 2012; 4: 413-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 2Reichert J.M. Which are the antibodies to watch in 2013?.MAbs. 2013; 5: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and an estimated 350 antibody-based therapeutics are in the clinical pipeline (2Reichert J.M. Which are the antibodies to watch in 2013?.MAbs. 2013; 5: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, antibody-based reagents are ubiquitous in diagnostic and research settings as valuable recognition tools. Although the pharmaceutical market is estimated to be worth more than forty billion U.S. dollars, diagnostic- and research-based antibody markets in 2012 were valued at eight billion and two billion, respectively. 6S. Yu, unpublished data. Antibodies have come of age due to our increased understanding of their function, specificity, and origins. This collectively assembled knowledge-base draws observations from a number of disciplines including: structural biology, immunogenetics, cellular immunology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics (4Finlay W.J. Almagro J.C. Natural and man-made V-gene repertoires for antibody discovery.Front. Immunol. 2012; 3: 342Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of antibodies, both free and antigen-complexed, has played a central role in elucidating humoral immune response mechanisms, evolution of the antibody repertoire, and optimization of in vitro-generated antibodies (5Raghunathan G. Smart J. Williams J. Almagro J.C. Antigen-binding site anatomy and somatic mutations in antibodies that recognize different types of antigens.J. Mol. Recognit. 2012; 25: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This has resulted in a number of powerful technological advances that have allowed protein engineers to actively harness and augment the potential of the immune system, including in vitro display technologies (6Bradbury A.R. Sidhu S. Dübel S. McCafferty J. Beyond natural antibodies: the power of in vitro display technologies.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), humanization (7Safdari Y. Farajnia S. Asgharzadeh M. Khalili M. Antibody humanization methods: a review and update.Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev. 2013; 29: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and engineering of biophysical properties (e.g. affinity, functional activity, specificity) (4Finlay W.J. Almagro J.C. Natural and man-made V-gene repertoires for antibody discovery.Front. Immunol. 2012; 3: 342Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The natural immune repertoire is dynamic, with the capacity to generate a repertoire of 108 by affinity maturation in vivo, which is substantiated by continual exposure or sensitization to antigens from the environment or by immunization (8Hearty S. O'Kennedy R. Exploiting recombinant antibodies in point-of-care (POC) diagnostics: the combinatorial advantage.Bioeng. Bugs. 2011; 2: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Artificial manipulation of antibody genes has facilitated in vitro selection of truly unique antibodies from extremely large combinatorial libraries, which can be constructed from virtually any species, isolated from B-cells derived from naïve, immunized, or infected subjects or are partially or wholly synthesized in vitro (8Hearty S. O'Kennedy R. Exploiting recombinant antibodies in point-of-care (POC) diagnostics: the combinatorial advantage.Bioeng. Bugs. 2011; 2: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Display technologies such as phage, yeast, and ribosome display, when combined with high-throughput approaches for judicious library screening, have enabled the development of antibodies with highly tailored affinities, specificities, and biophysical properties (9Conroy P.J. Hearty S. Leonard P. O'Kennedy R.J. Antibody production, design, and use for biosensor-based applications.Semin. Cell Dev.

Cardiac troponin I: a case study in rational antibody design for human diagnostics.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2012; 25: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The merits of in vitro-based antibody approaches, although largely under-appreciated by the research community, allow one to isolate antibodies with properties extremely or if not impossible to attain using the immune system alone (6Bradbury A.R. Sidhu S. Dübel S. McCafferty J. Beyond natural antibodies: the power of in vitro display technologies.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 8Hearty S.

Manufacturing immunity to disease in a test tube: the magic bullet realized.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45: 8106-8125Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These powerful avenues of antibody development are of considerable importance for development of novel therapeutic entities and next generation diagnostic reagents and address the consternation among researchers arising from a preponderance of subpar research antibodies (12Saper C.B. An open letter to our readers on the use of antibodies.J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 493: 477-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 13Bordeaux J. Welsh A. Agarwal S. Killiam E. Baquero M. Hanna J.

A roadmap to generate renewable protein binders to the human proteome.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The specificity of antibodies is dictated by the hypervariable loops (15Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Canonical structures for the hypervariable regions of immunoglobulins.J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) or complementarity-determining regions (CDR) 7The abbreviations used are:CDRcomplementarity determining regioncTnIcardiac troponin IFWRframe-work regionPSAprostate-specific antigenscFvsingle chain fragment variableFCflow cell. (16Wu T.T. Kabat E.A. An analysis of the sequences of the variable regions of Bence Jones proteins and myeloma light chains and their implications for antibody complementarity.J. Exp. Med. 1970; 132: 211-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) that form the sites for contact with its cognate antigen. The CDRs are described by canonical conformations, which are defined by the length of the hypervariable loop and both hypervariable loop/frame work region (FWR)-conserved residues (15Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Canonical structures for the hypervariable regions of immunoglobulins.J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). The FWR provides a structural scaffold for the antigen binding site and are important for structural diversity, the VL/VH orientation (4Finlay W.J. Almagro J.C. Natural and man-made V-gene repertoires for antibody discovery.Front. Immunol. 2012; 3: 342Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Abhinandan K.R. Martin A.C. Analysis and prediction of VH/VL packing in antibodies.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2010; 23: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and in some instances may make direct antigen contacts. The IgY (Fig. 1A) is the typical low molecular weight antibody (180 kDa) of birds, amphibian, and reptiles and is considered to be the ancestral form of the mammalian IgG and IgE. Although similar to IgG, the IgY is structurally distinct (18Warr G.W. Magor K.E. Higgins D.A. IgY: clues to the origins of modern antibodies.Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 392-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) due to the presence of an additional constant heavy domain, lack of a bona fide hinge region, and differing oligosaccharide side-chain composition and, unlike IgG, is capable of eliciting anaphylactic mechanisms. As the hinge region is absent in IgY, its flexibility is derived from proline-glycine-rich regions at the Cν1-Cν2 and Cν2-Cν3 domains (18Warr G.W. Magor K.E. Higgins D.A. IgY: clues to the origins of modern antibodies.Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 392-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). At the genetic level, in contrast to humans, mice, and primates, the v-gene repertoire of chickens employs single functional v-genes for the heavy (VH3 family) and light chains (exclusively λ light chains), which contain unique VL-JL and VH-DH-JH segments (19Shih H.H. Tu C. Cao W. Klein A. Ramsey R. Fennell B.J. Lambert M. Ní Shúilleabháin D. Autin B. Kouranova E. Laxmanan S. Braithwaite S. Wu L. Ait-Zahra M. Milici A.J. Dumin J.A. LaVallie E.R. Arai M.

Chem. 2012; 287: 44425-44434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition to somatic hypermutation, to generate a diverse functional antibody repertoire from such a restricted v-gene germ-line, chickens employ “gene conversion”. This process is analogous to that in rabbits where each v-gene is significantly diversified by recombination of segments from upstream pseudogene blocks, which lack recombination signal sequences (Fig. 1B). As a consequence, the repertoire requires sequence homology between the germ line and pseudogenes to allow for donation of gene segments. Hence, a low level of FWR mutations was observed in VH repertoire analysis coupled with maintenance of CDR structural residues, but modulation of those residues, which affect VH/VL interfaces (20Wu L. Oficjalska K. Lambert M. Fennell B.J. Darmanin-Sheehan A. Ní Shúilleabháin D. Autin B. Cummins E. Tchistiakova L. Bloom L. Paulsen J. Gill D. Cunningham O. Finlay W.J. Fundamental characteristics of the immunoglobulin VH repertoire of chickens in comparison with those of humans, mice, and camelids.J. Immunol. 2012; 188: 322-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The chicken immune system can, therefore, introduce variability at selected FWR residues, resulting in structural diversity of VH/VL angles (4Finlay W.J. Almagro J.C. Natural and man-made V-gene repertoires for antibody discovery.Front. Immunol. 2012; 3: 342Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Wu L. Oficjalska K. Lambert M. Fennell B.J.

Fundamental characteristics of the immunoglobulin VH repertoire of chickens in comparison with those of humans, mice, and camelids.J. Immunol. 2012; 188: 322-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The D-segments of chickens (15 functional segments) are highly homologous, and hyper-diversification is achieved by gene conversion at D-D junctions, creating “mosaic CDRs” (19Shih H.H. Tu C. Cao W. Klein A. Ramsey R. Fennell B.J. Lambert M. Ní Shúilleabháin D. Autin B. Kouranova E. Laxmanan S. Braithwaite S. Wu L. Ait-Zahra M. Milici A.J. Dumin J.A. LaVallie E.R. Arai M. Corcoran C.

Chem. 2012; 287: 44425-44434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These D-segments contain cysteine residues at a far higher frequency than humans or mice. This prevalence results in >50% of the chicken repertoire containing non-canonical CDRH3 cysteine residues and potentially plays an important role in functional diversity. Structures of such disulfide-containing CDRH3 across species are rare, as cysteine residues are observed at low frequency in mature B-cells (20Wu L. Oficjalska K. Lambert M. Fennell B.J.

Immunol. 2012; 188: 322-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, selection of avian CDRH3 non-canonical disulfide-containing clones from Escherichia coli indicates that it is possible to efficiently sample the full breadth of the chicken repertoire by phage display (19Shih H.H.

The use of chickens as diagnostic, and indeed therapeutic antibody generation hosts, is advantageous due to their phylogenetic distance from man, tolerance of multiple immunogens, and demonstrated successes in generating antibodies to a wide range of antigens (10Conroy P.J.

Furthermore, the simplistic arrangement of v-genes, high core temperature, and increased CDRH3 length provide potentially superior antibody biophysical attributes. The unique properties of chicken antibodies have been demonstrated experimentally and are illustrated by detailed repertoire analysis. However, few investigations have examined the structural basis of these attributes to explain the demonstrated functional biology. In this study we have resolved the high resolution crystal structures of two unique chicken antibodies, selected from protein- and peptide-immunized repertoires by phage display, with nanomolar and picomolar affinity (10Conroy P.J. O'Kennedy R.J. Hearty S. Cardiac troponin I: a case study in rational antibody design for human diagnostics.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2012; 25: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The crystal structures have revealed unique topologies and arrangements within the CDRs of chicken antibodies that contribute our increased understanding of antibody diversity. The single chain fragment variable (scFv) libraries were generated in the VL-VH orientation, as described by Andris-Widhopf et al. (21Andris-Widhopf J. Rader C. Steinberger P. Fuller R. Barbas 3rd., C.F. Methods for the generation of chicken monoclonal antibody fragments by phage display.J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 242: 159-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Clone 180 was selected from a cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) peptide (39KISASRKLQLKT50)-immunized repertoire by iterative cycles of phage display, as described previously (10Conroy P.J. O'Kennedy R.J.

Clone B8 was selected from a PSA protein (human seminal fluid; SCIPAC)-immunized repertoire. Briefly, an adult leghorn was immunized with PSA, sacrificed, and the antibody repertoire was accessed from mRNA isolated from B-cells (femur bone marrow and spleen tissue) and displayed on the surface of filamentous phage (21Andris-Widhopf J.

The antibody was isolated by iterative cycles phage display with increasing stringency exerted by serial limitation of adsorbed PSA. ScFv antibodies were expressed within the periplasmic space of E. coli Top10F′ (Invitrogen) with the pComb3x vector (21Andris-Widhopf J. Rader C. Steinberger P. Fuller R. Barbas 3rd., C.F.

This starter culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of Superbroth with 25 μg/ml carbenicillin and was grown to A600 = ∼0.6 before subculturing into 10 × 500 ml of Superbroth with 25 μg/ml carbenicillin (2-liter flasks). At A600 = ∼0.6, the cultures were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C with shaking at 230 rpm overnight (∼16 h). The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (3220 × g) at 4 °C for 20 min. Soluble scFv were released from the periplasmic space by osmotic shock in a two-step process. The pellet was first thoroughly resuspended in 1× TBS (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), and an equal volume of 2× shock buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 m sucrose, and 2 mm EDTA) was added before incubation at room temperature for 15 min. Shocked cells were recovered by centrifugation (12,400 × g at 4 °C for 20 min) followed by resuspension in ice-cold 5 mm MgSO4 and incubation on ice for 15 min. The periplasmic-stripped cells were collected by centrifugation (27,200 × g at 4 °C for 20 min), and 0.2 times the volume of 5× binding buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 750 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, 0.02% NaN3) was added to the supernatant. HisBind (Novagen) resin (1 ml equilibrated in 30 ml of 1× binding buffer) was added, and scFv was recovered by batch binding for 2 h at 4 °C on an end-over-end roller. The resin was collected by gravity flow and washed with 30 ml of binding buffer followed by a second wash with 30 ml of wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.05% (v/v) Tween® 20, 0.02% NaN3). Bound protein was eluted with 7–10 ml of elution buffer (1× running buffer, 300 mm imidazole) in 0.5-ml fractions, and protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to 2 ml in a 3-kDa concentrator (Merck-Millipore). The pooled fractions were resolved by size exclusion chromatography (S75 16/60; GE Healthcare) in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3. The purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Both scFvs were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance-based kinetic evaluation in a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-capture approach. An anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was immobilized by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC)-N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (GE Healthcare) coupling on the surface of a CM5 chip (GE Healthcare) and capped with 1 m ethanolamine (10Conroy P.J.

Dysregulated activation of leukocytes via exogenous and endogenous ligands of TLR4 results in a large number of inflammatory disorders that underlie a variety of human diseases. Thus, differentially blocking inflammatory cells while sparing structural cells, which are FcγR-negative, represents an elegant strategy when targeting the underlying causes of human diseases. Here, we report a novel tethering mechanism of the Fv and Fc portions of anti-TLR4 blocking antibodies that achieves increased potency on inflammatory cells. In the presence of ligand (e.g. lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), TLR4 traffics into glycolipoprotein microdomains, forming concentrated protein platforms that include FcγRs. This clustering produces a microenvironment allowing anti-TLR4 antibodies to co-engage TLR4 and FcγRs, increasing their avidity and thus substantially increasing their inhibitory potency. Tethering of antibodies to both TLR4 and FcγRs proves valuable in ameliorating inflammation in vivo. This novel mechanism of action therefore has the potential to enable selective intervention of relevant cell types in TLR4-driven diseases.

https://openalex.org/W1995176586,"Identifying signatures of selection can provide valuable insight about the genes or genomic regions that are or have been under selective pressure, which can lead to a better understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships. A common strategy for selection signature detection is to compare samples from several populations and search for genomic regions with outstanding genetic differentiation. Wright's fixation index, FST, is a useful index for evaluation of genetic differentiation between populations. The aim of this study was to detect selective signatures between different chicken groups based on SNP-wise FST calculation. A total of 96 individuals of three commercial layer breeds and 14 non-commercial fancy breeds were genotyped with three different 600K SNP-chips. After filtering a total of 1 million SNPs were available for FST calculation. Averages of FST values were calculated for overlapping windows. Comparisons of these were then conducted between commercial egg layers and non-commercial fancy breeds, as well as between white egg layers and brown egg layers. Comparing non-commercial and commercial breeds resulted in the detection of 630 selective signatures, while 656 selective signatures were detected in the comparison between the commercial egg-layer breeds. Annotation of selection signature regions revealed various genes corresponding to productions traits, for which layer breeds were selected. Among them were NCOA1, SREBF2 and RALGAPA1 associated with reproductive traits, broodiness and egg production. Furthermore, several of the detected genes were associated with growth and carcass traits, including POMC, PRKAB2, SPP1, IGF2, CAPN1, TGFb2 and IGFBP2. Our approach demonstrates that including different populations with a specific breeding history can provide a unique opportunity for a better understanding of farm animal selection."

Herein, we report that ARTN mediates acquired resistance to trastuzumab in HER2-positive mammary carcinoma cells. Ligands that increase HER2 activity increased ARTN expression in HER2-positive mammary carcinoma cells, whereas trastuzumab inhibited ARTN expression. Forced expression of ARTN decreased the sensitivity of HER2-positive mammary carcinoma cells to trastuzumab both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, siRNA-mediated depletion of ARTN enhanced trastuzumab efficacy. Cells with acquired resistance to trastuzumab exhibited increased ARTN expression, the depletion of which restored trastuzumab sensitivity. Trastuzumab resistance produced an increased CSC population concomitant with enhanced mammospheric growth. ARTN mediated the enhancement of the CSC population by increased BCL-2 expression, and the CSC population in trastuzumab-resistant cells was abrogated upon inhibition of BCL-2.

https://openalex.org/W2121037843,"Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is prevalent in patients with hypertension and is an independent risk factor for aortic pathologies. HHcy is known to cause an imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), leading to the accumulation of collagen in the aorta and resulting in stiffness and development of hypertension. Although the exact mechanism of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is unclear, emerging evidence implicates epigenetic regulation involving DNA methylation. Our purpose was to investigate whether 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza), a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) inhibitor, reduces high blood pressure (BP) by regulating aortic ECM remodeling in HHcy. Wild-type and cystathionine β-synthase (CBS)+ HHcy mice were treated with Aza (0.5 mg/kg body weight). In HHcy mice, Aza treatment normalized the plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level and BP. Thoracic and abdominal aorta ultrasound revealed a reduction in the resistive index and wall-to-lumen ratio. Vascular response to phenylephrine, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside improved after Aza in HHcy mice. Histology showed a marked reduction in collagen deposition in the aorta. Aza treatment decreased the expression of DNMT1, MMP9, TIMP1, and S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) and upregulated methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). We conclude that reduction of DNA methylation by Aza in HHcy reduces adverse aortic remodeling to mitigate hypertension.—Narayanan, N., Pushpakumar, S.

The present study was undertaken to analyze the salicylic acid induced leaf transcriptome of W. somnifera. A total of 45.6 million reads were generated and the de novo assembly yielded 73,523 transcript contig with average transcript contig length of 1620 bp. A total of 71,062 transcripts were annotated and 53,424 of them were assigned GO terms. Mapping of transcript contigs to biological pathways revealed presence of 182 pathways. Seventeen genes representing 12 pathogenesis-related (PR) families were mined from the transcriptome data and their pattern of expression post 17 and 36 hours of salicylic acid treatment was documented. The analysis revealed significant up-regulation of all families of PR genes by 36 hours post treatment except WsPR10. The relative fold expression of transcripts ranged from 1 fold to 6,532 fold. The two families of peroxidases including the lignin-forming anionic peroxidase (WsL-PRX) and suberization-associated anionic peroxidase (WsS-PRX) recorded maximum expression of 377 fold and 6532 fold respectively, while the expression of WsPR10 was down-regulated by 14 fold. Additionally, the most stable reference gene for normalization of qRT-PCR data was also identified. The effect of SA on the accumulation of major secondary metabolites of W. somnifera including withanoside V, withaferin A and withanolide A was also analyzed and an increase in content of all the three metabolites were detected.

https://openalex.org/W1988967913,"Uracil-DNA glycosylase (Ung) is a component of the base excision repair process and has the ability to remove uracil from U:G mispairs in DNA. However, its implications in development of vertebrate embryos are poorly understood. In this study, we found that zebrafish uracil-DNA glycosylase a (Unga) is maternally expressed at high levels and accumulated in nuclei during cleavage and blastulation periods. Knockdown of unga in zebrafish embryos causes an increase of the global DNA methylation level concomitantly with a reduction of overall transcriptional activity in the nucleus, ultimately resulting in embryonic lethality during segmentation period. Conversely, unga overexpression is sufficient to reduce the global DNA methylation level, to increase H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks, and to activate genome transcription. Furthermore, overexpression of unga(D132A) mRNA, encoding a mutant Unga without DNA glycosylase activity, does not affect global DNA methylation level, indicating that its involvement in DNA demethylation is dependent on its glycosylase activity. These results together suggest that Unga is implicated in postfertilization genomic DNA demethylation, zygotic gene transcription, and normal embryonic development in zebrafish."

This enzyme is found to adopt an open conformation without a functional triad in its ligand-free form and a closed conformation with a fully functional catalytic triad in the presence of its reaction product. The open-to-closed conformational transition involves movement of half of the α-helical cap domain, which causes extensive structural changes in the α/β-domain and forces the side chain of the triad histidine to adopt an energetically disfavored gauche conformation to form the functional triad. NMR analysis shows that the inactive open conformation without a triad prevails in ligand-free solution and is converted to the closed conformation with a properly formed triad by the reaction product. Mutation of the residues crucial to this open-closed transition either greatly decreases or completely eliminates the enzyme activity, supporting an important catalytic role for the structural change. These findings suggest that the open-closed conformational change tightly couples formation of the catalytic triad to substrate binding to enhance the substrate specificities and simultaneously shield the nucleophilicity of the triad, thus allowing it to expand its catalytic power beyond the nucleophilic catalysis.

The serine (Ser)-histidine (His)-aspartate (Asp) triad is a well known catalytic motif that is utilized in catalysis of a diverse array of chemical transformations by a large number of enzymes. One group of these triad-dependent enzymes includes numerous hydrolytic enzymes in the trypsin and subtilisin families of serine peptidases that cleave C–N bonds in peptide substrates (1Page M.J. Di Cera E. Serine peptidases: classification, structure and function.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1220-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Another group of enzymes utilizing this triad or its variants are members of the α/β-hydrolase fold superfamily that catalyze cleavage of C–O, C–S, C–C, or C–halogen bonds in structurally diverse metabolites or even cofactor-independent haloperoxidation and dioxygenation of electron-rich substrates (2Nardini M. Dijkstra B.W. α/β Hydrolase fold enzymes: the family keeps growing.Curr. Opin. Struct.

Sci. 2000; 1: 209-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Commensurate with their functional diversity, these enzymes display vast structural diversity in size, structure fold, and three-dimensional architecture. However, they converge to form the conserved triad and the associated oxyanion hole as a stable, integrative catalytic unit from distal residues, which are arranged in one enantiomeric configuration in α/β-hydrolase fold enzymes and in another configuration in members of the trypsin and subtilisin families (3Holmquist M. α/β-Hydrolase fold enzymes: structures, functions and mechanisms.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2000; 1: 209-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Besides this structural conservation, a majority of these enzymes use the triad to catalyze the diverse chemical transformations via a similar nucleophilic mechanism, which is characterized by formation of a covalent enzyme adduct involving nucleophilic addition of the triad serine to the substrate (3Holmquist M. α/β-Hydrolase fold enzymes: structures, functions and mechanisms.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2000; 1: 209-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 4Hedstrom L. Serine protease mechanism and specificity.Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Besides the traditional nucleophilic mechanism of catalysis, the Ser-His-Asp triad has also been proposed to play the role of a simple general base in the catalysis of some α/β-hydrolases. In the catalysis of cyanohydrin lyases, the triad is postulated to deprotonate hydrogen cyanide for addition to aldehydes and ketones (5Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K.

However, recent investigations have shown that the C–C bond hydrolase BphD adopts the traditional covalent, nucleophilic mechanism of catalysis because of the finding of an acyl-enzyme intermediate (10Ruzzini A.C.

Recently, the vitamin K biosynthetic enzyme (1R,6R)-2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate (SHCHC) 2The abbreviations used are:SHCHC(1R,6R)-2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylateMenH(1R,6R)-2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate synthaseSEPHCHC(1R,2S,5S,6S)-2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylater.m.s.d.root mean square difference. synthase (MenH) has been shown to use its Ser-His-Asp triad as a general base. This enzyme is also a typical α/β-hydrolase fold enzyme and is responsible for 2,5-elimination of pyruvate from (1R,2S,5S,6S)-2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate (SEPHCHC) to form SHCHC (14Jiang M.

The MenH catalytic triad most likely catalyzes simple abstraction of a proton from the α-carbon of the succinyl carbonyl group of the substrate to form an enolate intermediate that subsequently undergoes elimination of the enolpyruvyl group in an E1cb mechanism (Fig. 1) (15Jiang M.

This distinctive MenH catalytic mechanism demonstrates that the classical Ser-His-Asp triad is indeed capable of new catalytic chemistry.

Despite its unique mechanism of catalysis, the MenH triad is not found to be structurally different from that of other triad-utilizing enzymes (Refs. 14Jiang M. Chen X. Guo Z.-F. Cao Y. Chen M.

Crystal structures of E. coli native MenH and two active site mutants.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e61325Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar and Protein Data Bank code 1R3D). In addition, mutational studies found that the MenH catalytic triad contributes to rate enhancement of at least 106-fold to the catalysis of the enzyme (14Jiang M. Chen X. Guo Z.-F. Cao Y. Chen M. Guo Z. Identification and characterization of (1R,6R)-2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate synthase in the menaquinone biosynthesis of Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 3426-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), similar to the catalytic contribution of the triads of serine proteases. At present, it is not clear why the structurally similar triad plays the role of a catalytic base in MenH catalysis but a nucleophile in catalysis of other triad-dependent enzymes. To further understand the catalytic mechanism of MenH, we determined the crystal structure of the enzyme with and without its products. We found that formation of the catalytic triad is subject to control by an open-closed conformational change. This finding not only provides new insights into the MenH catalytic mechanism but also reveals a new mechanism for control and modulation of reactivity of the catalytic triad. The expression constructs of the mutants of Escherichia coli MenH, including V152A, V152G, F153A, Y148F, Y148A, V152G/F153A, and W147A/Y148A, were generated with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutants were sequenced to ensure that only the expected mutations had been incorporated into the amplified DNA. The wild-type MenH and its mutants were expressed and purified according to a procedure reported previously (15Jiang M. Chen X. Wu X.-H. Chen M. Wu Y.D. Guo Z. Catalytic mechanism of SHCHC synthase in the menaquinone biosynthesis of Escherichia coli: identification and mutational analysis of the active site residues.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6921-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, the expression plasmid for a target protein was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and the resulting recombinant cells were grown in Luria broth (LB) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. For expression of 15N-labeled MenH, the cells were grown in M9 minimum medium containing 1g/liter [15N]NH4Cl and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Overexpression of all proteins was induced using 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at 18 °C. The recombinant proteins were purified to greater than 95% purity as indicated by SDS-PAGE via Ni2+-chelating column chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. The purified unlabeled proteins were concentrated and stored in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 10% glycerol for crystallization or activity assays, whereas the labeled protein was stored in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and 10% glycerol at pH 7.4. Protein concentration was estimated using a Coomassie Blue protein assay kit (Pierce). The reaction product of MenH, SHCHC, was prepared using a chemoenzymatic method described previously (14Jiang M.

Typically, a mixture of 12.5 mm chorismate, 50 mm 2-ketoglutarate, 75 μm thiamine diphosphate, and 7.5 mm MgSO4 was incubated with 30 μm EntC, 30 μm MenD, and 15 μm MenH in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer at 32 °C for 3 h. The resulting SHCHC solution was then purified by HPLC using an isocratic elution with aqueous solution containing 1% formic acid. The enzyme substrate SEPHCHC was synthesized similarly in the absence of MenH (22Jiang M. Chen M. Cao Y. Yang Y. Sze K.H. Chen X. Guo Z.

Hilvert D. Efficient in vivo synthesis and rapid purification of chorismic acid using an engineered Escherichia coli strain.Bioorg. Chem. 1997; 25: 297-305Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The assay for the SHCHC synthase activity of MenH has been described previously (14Jiang M. Chen X. Guo Z.-F. Cao Y. Chen M. Guo Z. Identification and characterization of (1R,6R)-2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate synthase in the menaquinone biosynthesis of Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 3426-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reactions were carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 containing the SEPHCHC substrate at varied concentrations. MenH and its mutants were then added to the mixture to initiate the reaction. Production of SHCHC was monitored in real time by the increase in absorbance at 290 nm. One-dimension NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian UNITY Inova 500-MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with an actively z-gradient-shielded triple resonance probe where the water signal was suppressed using the WATERGATE sequence. For each spectrum, 1024 scans were acquired consisting of 128,000 data points with a spectral width of 35 ppm at 4 °C. The concentration of MenH or the H232A mutant was fixed at 0.33 mm, and SHCHC was titrated into the MenH solution to a concentration of 0.165, 0.33, and 0.66 mm. As a control, one-dimension proton NMR was collected for 0.36 mm SHCHC alone. To determine which of the protons at δH = 19.10 and 14.16 ppm is hydrogen-bonded to the imidazole side chain of His232, a mixture of 0.40 mm 15N-labeled MenH and 0.80 mm SHCHC was used for analysis by heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy. However, no cross-peaks were found probably because of the weak 15N signals. The dissociation constant (KD) for binding of the SHCHC ligand by MenH or its H232A mutant was determined by the ligand-dependent quenching of tryptophan fluorescence with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Model LS-55 luminescence spectrometer. Specifically, the SHCHC ligand was titrated into the solution of MenH or the H232A mutant at 2.0 μm in the 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The tryptophan fluorophore was excited at 280 nm, and its emission (F) at 340 nm was recorded. The dissociation constant was determined by the least square fitting of the fluorescence-[SHCHC] curves according to the equation F/F0 = KD/(KD + [SHCHC]) where F0 is the tryptophan fluorescence of the protein in the absence of any ligands. Rapid kinetic measurements of either UV-visible absorption or fluorescence emission were performed on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV-R stopped-flow reaction analyzer mounted with an Applied Photophysics spectral kinetic monochromator. In pre-steady state kinetic measurements, 50-μl aliquots of MenH at 2.0 μm were mixed with an equal volume of SEPHCHC solution at concentrations varying from 5.0 to 240 μm. The release of the SHCHC product was monitored at 290 nm for a total of 200 ms with a 1-ms dead time. In the kinetic measurement of SHCHC binding, 50-μl aliquots of MenH at 1.0 μm were mixed with an equal volume of SHCHC at concentrations varying from 0 to 360 μm. Quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence emission at 340 nm was determined over a period of 200 ms as a change of fluorescence voltage (photomultiplier tube voltage) using a 305-nm high pass filter with a monochromatic excitation wavelength of 280 nm. The buffer used in the stopped-flow experiments was 0.20 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. The slit width of the monochromator source was set to 8 nm in all experiments. Initial screening of crystallization conditions for ligand-free MenH and MenH in complex with SHCHC was performed using hanging drop vapor diffusion with a range of screen kits (Hampton Research) at 293 K. The concentrations of MenH and SHCHC were 10 mg/ml and 2 mm, respectively. The protein solution was mixed with the reservoir solution in a 1:1 ratio in these screening trials. Small ellipsoid and rhombohedral crystals were obtained within 1 week under the same conditions for both the complex and the ligand-free protein. After several rounds of optimization, the longest dimension of the crystals reached about 100 μm. However, neither the complex nor the ligand-free protein crystals diffracted to a high resolution on an in-house x-ray diffractometer. After optimization via additive screens using the Crystal Screen kit and Crystal Screen II kit (Hampton Research), cuboid-shaped crystals of ligand-free MenH were observed in solution containing 0.2 m Li2SO4, 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 9.0, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 17% PEG 3350 with a dimension of 300 × 300 × 200 μm. Large, rod-shaped crystals (500 μm for the longest dimension) of the MenH complex were obtained when the initial screens were rechecked 2 months later in solution containing 1.6 m sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 6.9. The ternary complex was crystallized under the same conditions as for the binary complex with the addition of 2 mm pyruvate. The crystals were mounted and soaked in cryoprotectant containing 20% glycerol in the mother liquor and then flash frozen in liquid N2. X-ray diffraction data were collected for the crystals of ligand-free MenH and the complexes at beamline BL17U at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility with an ADSC Quantum 315R charge-coupled device detector. Diffraction images were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). The ligand-free MenH structure was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (25McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J.

The initial electron density map indicated that one MenH polypeptide chain was correctly located in the asymmetric unit in space group P3121. The model was then extended via automatic model building using the program ARP/wARP (27Langer G. Cohen S.X. Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A.

Open table in a new tab Based on the diffraction patterns, the MenH-SHCHC complex crystal is in the P3121 space group. The crystal structure solved by molecular replacement with Phaser using the ligand-free MenH structure as the search model contained a high solvent content of 66.1% with one-third of the crystal volume occupied by non-interpretable electron densities. Although the unit cell contains MenH molecules with very well defined electron densities, this structure did not appear to be a correct solution. The diffraction data set was then reindexed to the P31 space group for structural determination by molecular replacement using Phaser and BALBES (33Long F. Vagin A.A. Young P. Murshudov G.N. BALBES: a molecular replacement pipeline.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2008; 64: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The resulting structure contained two well defined MenH molecules in the asymmetric unit, which also contained uninterpreted electron densities in one-third of its volume. A third MenH molecule was successfully generated in the asymmetric unit after model building by OASIS (34Zhang T. Gu Y.-X. Zheng C.-D. Fan H.-F. OASIS4.0—a new version of the program OASIS for phasing protein diffraction data.Chin. Phys. B. 2010; 19 (086101)Google Scholar) albeit with poor and disconnected electron densities. By applying the merohedral twin law (h, −h−k, −l), the model was eventually refined by Phenix.refine to a high resolution with Rwork/Rfree = 0.13/0.15. However, the actual Rwork/Rfree was found to be 0.23/0.25 in the validation process, indicative of the absence of twinning in the crystal. Examination of the reflection images and the self-rotation function found that the crystal likely had an order-disorder structure (35Hare S. Cherepanov P. Wang J.

https://openalex.org/W1998709310,"Macrophages play diverse roles in tissue homeostasis and immunity, and canonically activated macrophages are critically associated with acute inflammatory responses. It is known that activated macrophages undergo cell death after transient activation in some settings, and the viability of macrophages impacts on inflammatory status. Here we report that TGFβ- activated kinase (TAK1) activators, TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) and TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2), are critical molecules in the regulation of activated macrophage survival. While deletion of Tak1 induced cell death in bone marrow derived macrophages even without activation, Tab1 or Tab2 deletion alone did not profoundly affect survival of naïve macrophages. However, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages, even single deletion of Tab1 or Tab2 resulted in macrophage death with both necrotic and apoptotic features. We show that TAB1 and TAB2 were redundantly involved in LPS-induced TAK1 activation in macrophages. These results demonstrate that TAK1 activity is the key to activated macrophage survival. Finally, in an in vivo setting, Tab1 deficiency impaired increase of peritoneal macrophages upon LPS challenge, suggesting that TAK1 complex regulation of macrophages may participate in in vivo macrophage homeostasis. Our results demonstrate that TAB1 and TAB2 are required for activated macrophages, making TAB1 and TAB2 effective targets to control inflammation by modulating macrophage survival."

However, its function at later stages of pancreatic carcinogenesis remains poorly understood. To address this issue, we crossed the gli1 knock-out (GKO) animal with cre-dependent pancreatic activation of oncogenic kras concomitant with loss of the tumor suppressor tp53 (KPC). Interestingly, in this model, GLI1 played a tumor-protective function, where survival of GKO/KPC mice was reduced compared with KPC littermates. Both cohorts developed pancreatic cancer without significant histopathological differences in survival studies. However, analysis of mice using ultrasound-based imaging at earlier time points showed increased tumor burden in GKO/KPC mice. These animals have larger tumors, decreased body weight, increased lactate dehydrogenase production, and severe leukopenia. In vivo and in vitro expression studies identified FAS and FAS ligand (FASL) as potential mediators of this phenomenon. The FAS/FASL axis, an apoptotic inducer, plays a role in the progression of pancreatic cancer, where its expression is usually lost or significantly reduced in advanced stages of the disease. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays identified FAS and FASL as direct targets of GLI1, whereas GKO/KPC mice showed lower levels of this ligand compared with KPC animals. Finally, decreased levels of apoptosis were detected in tumor tissue in the absence of GLI1 by TUNEL staining.

Recently, we demonstrated that the loss of GLI1 in a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) blocks the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanIN) induced by oncogenic KRAS (10Mills L.D.

In agreement with these findings, using a transgenic model overexpressing a repressor form of the transcription factor GLI3 to antagonize GLI1 activity, Rajurkar et al. (11Rajurkar M.

Furthermore, several studies demonstrate that blocking Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), the most well established upstream regulator of GLI1, down-regulates GLI1 expression and inhibits tumor growth in established xenograft models, suggesting a role for GLI1 in pancreatic tumor progression (13Thayer S.P. di Magliano M.P.

To define the biological significance and molecular mechanisms associated with expression of GLI1 in the advanced stages of tumor progression, and the mechanisms driving this phenomenon, we generated a quadruple cross GEMM resembling these late stages of the disease. This mouse model contained p48 cre-dependent activation of oncogenic Kras and loss of tumor suppressor tp53 (KPC) and gli1 resulting in the GKO/KPC mouse. We hypothesized that the loss of Gli1 in this model would result in prolonged survival and lower frequency of pancreas tumors. Interestingly, both cohorts retained the common biological and molecular features of advanced pancreatic cancer, but GKO/KPC mice developed early signs of tumor burden and perished within the 1st month of life. Loss of GLI1 accelerated disease progression as shown by decreased survival, body weight, fatigue, increased tumor volume, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and leukopenia. Analysis of the mechanism showed that both FAS and FAS ligand (FASL) expression were significantly decreased in the GKO/KPC cohort. Down-regulation of these pro-apoptotic proteins is often associated with the progression of many cancers in conjunction with loss of tumor suppressor p53 (14Boldrini L. Faviana P. Pistolesi F.

Using ChIP assays, we demonstrate endogenous GLI1 binding to the FAS and FASL promoters. Furthermore, overexpression and knockdown studies confirm a role for GLI1 in the regulation of the expression of these genes. Finally, TUNEL staining of pancreas sections resulted in decreased levels of apoptosis in the GLI1-null group demonstrating the existence of a novel GLI1-FASL/FAS axis in pancreatic cancer. We hope this knowledge will provide a new theoretical framework to help with the analysis of existing studies targeting GLI1-related pathways as well as the design of future clinical trials. Mice were housed in pathogenic free conditions and maintained in facilities approved by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care in accordance with current regulations and standards of the United States Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, and National Institutes of Health/IACUC.

Images were taken with an Olympus BX-51 microscope, Olympus DP71 digital camera, and DP Controller (Axioplan, II-Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Mice pancreata were imaged via ultrasound using the VEVO2100 small imaging system. Briefly, mice were anesthetized using 1.5 liters/min oxygen/isofluorane mixture and then gently taped to the imaging stage. One-two ml of normal saline was injected into the right flank via intraperitoneal injection. Visual signs of distress as well as vital signs were monitored on the VEVO2100 (VisualSonics Inc, Ontario, Canada). Mice were imaged in both supine and oblique positions for better imaging. Still images were captured using the abdominal package in M-mode, and three images per pancreas (10 fields/analysis) were captured via three-dimensional Doppler for volume analysis following manufacturer's (VisualSonics) and published literature procedures (17Olive K.P.

KPC tumors have a highly fibrotic nature and appeared extremely bright in the ultrasound field; thus, we used WT or KC tumors as controls. These tumors appeared seedy/fluid and dark/dense as described for WT animals (Fig. 3A) (18Sastra S.A. Olive K.P. Quantification of murine pancreatic tumors by high-resolution ultrasound.Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 980: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Serum LDH was measured using a colorimetric kit (Abcam) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Briefly, 2.5 μl of serum was mixed with assay buffer, at time 0 and 30 min after incubation at 37 °C, and activity was measured by spectrophotometry at 450 λ. LDH activity was analyzed utilizing a linear standard curve equation (nmol/min/ml (in milliunits/ml)) by using the following equation: B × sample dilution/(t1 − t0) × V; where B is NADH (Mr = 763 g/mol) generated between t0 and t1 in nanomoles, and t0 and t1 indicate the absorbance at time 0 and after 30 min, respectively. V is the pretreated sample volume added into the reaction well (in milliliters). Mice were autopsied at 1 month of age. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were isolated from KPC and GKO/KPC spleens, and lymphocytes from spleen, mesenteric lymph node, thymus, and blood (WT and GKO not expressing oncogenic mutant kras). T-cells were isolated using the standard MACs isolation kit (Miltenyi, Cambridge, MA) and biotin/antibody mixture/microbeads. The FACS analysis was performed using a FACSCanto system (BD Biosciences) and FACSDiva software. Data were analyzed using FloJo software. Tissues were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription reactions were conducted using High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). To detect the expression of krasG12D mutant, pancreatic tissue from KPC and GKO/KPC mice was minced, and RNA was extracted. To amplify the 243-bp product from both the wild-type and mutant transcripts, the following primers were used: KRAS forward 5′-aggcctgctgaaaatgactg-3′ and reverse 5′-ccctcccgagttctcatgta-3′. Verification of the krasG12D allele was performed using HindIII digestion of the PCR product, which yields a 213- and 30-bp product present only in the mutant but not in the wild-type form of kras. Products were verified by sequencing to verify the G→A mutation in the cDNA. qPCRs in pancreas tumors were prepared with 1× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad) and various primers. All primers were optimized for amplification under reaction conditions as follows: 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 15 s, and 72, 76, and 80 °C for 10 s (with capture).

For the assays, mouse embryonic fibroblasts were plated in triplicate into six-well plates in medium containing 10% FBS. Twenty four hours later, cells were transfected as indicated above. Samples were collected and processed in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Intersample variations were controlled by measuring the total protein of samples in each well (Bio-Rad), and luciferase readouts were normalized to protein content. Relative luciferase activity represents luciferase readouts/protein concentrations normalized to control cells within each experiment. Patient samples analyzed for desmoplasia and GLI1 expression were cases from the Mayo Clinic that were recruited from October 1, 2000 to July 1, 2010. Recruitment, consent, and specimen collection were IRB-approved (IRB protocol number 06-002459) by our institution. Patient records were reviewed by a gastrointestinal specialist and confirmed as pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This study was done without the bias of underlying pathologies, prior treatment or demographics (gender, age, etc). Staging was performed using American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 6th Edition criteria. Patients were identified as resected, locally advanced, and/or metastatic. Resected patients were further categorized by stage IA, IIB, IIA, and IIB. Blinded histopathology analysis was performed by two expert pathologists at the Mayo Clinic, and desmoplasia was scored using the following criteria: 1) none; 2) mild; 3) moderate; and 4) severe. Median desmoplasia expression level was categorized into three groups as follows: (a) none/mild versus moderate versus severe; (b) severe versus none/mild/moderate; (c) moderate/severe versus none/mild. Analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

The proteolytic activity of HtrA (DegP) from Escherichia coli, a model prokaryotic HtrA, is stimulated by stressful conditions; the regulation of this process is mediated by the LA, LD, L1, L2, and L3 loops. The precise mechanism of action of the LA loop is not known due to a lack of data concerning its three-dimensional structure as well as its mode of interaction with other regulatory elements. To address these issues we generated a theoretical model of the three-dimensional structure of the LA loop as per the resting state of HtrA and subsequently verified its correctness experimentally. We identified intra- and intersubunit contacts that formed with the LA loops; these played an important role in maintaining HtrA in its inactive conformation. The most significant proved to be the hydrophobic interactions connecting the LA loops of the hexamer and polar contacts between the LA′ (the LA loop on an opposite subunit) and L1 loops on opposite subunits. Disturbance of these interactions caused the stimulation of HtrA proteolytic activity. We also demonstrated that LA loops contribute to the preservation of the integrity of the HtrA oligomer and to the stability of the monomer. The model presented in this work explains the regulatory role of the LA loop well; it should also be applicable to numerous Enterobacteriaceae pathogenic species as the amino acid sequences of the members of this bacterial family are highly conserved.

We identified intra- and intersubunit contacts that formed with the LA loops; these played an important role in maintaining HtrA in its inactive conformation. The most significant proved to be the hydrophobic interactions connecting the LA loops of the hexamer and polar contacts between the LA′ (the LA loop on an opposite subunit) and L1 loops on opposite subunits. Disturbance of these interactions caused the stimulation of HtrA proteolytic activity. We also demonstrated that LA loops contribute to the preservation of the integrity of the HtrA oligomer and to the stability of the monomer. The model presented in this work explains the regulatory role of the LA loop well; it should also be applicable to numerous Enterobacteriaceae pathogenic species as the amino acid sequences of the members of this bacterial family are highly conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2053278493,"Trisubstituted benzimidazoles have demonstrated potency against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Previously, a library of novel trisubstituted benzimidazoles was constructed for high throughput screening, and compounds were identified that exhibited potency against M. tuberculosis H37Rv and clinical isolates, and were not toxic to Vero cells. A new series of 2-cyclohexyl-5-acylamino-6-N, N-dimethylaminobenzimidazoles derivatives has been developed based on SAR studies. Screening identified compounds with potency against M. tuberculosis. A lead compound from this series, SB-P17G-A20, was discovered to have an MIC of 0.16 µg/mL and demonstrated efficacy in the TB murine acute model of infection based on the reduction of bacterial load in the lungs and spleen by 1.73 ± 0.24 Log10 CFU and 2.68 ± Log10 CFU, respectively, when delivered at 50 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection (IP) twice daily (bid). The activity of SB-P17G-A20 was determined to be concentration dependent and to have excellent stability in mouse and human plasma, and liver microsomes. Together, these studies demonstrate that SB-P17G-A20 has potency against M. tuberculosis clinical strains with varying susceptibility and efficacy in animal models of infection, and that trisubstituted benzimidazoles continue to be a platform for the development of novel inhibitors with efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2050251303,"Plasmodium falciparum and vivax are responsible for the majority of malaria infections worldwide, resulting in over a million deaths annually. Malaria parasites now show measured resistance to all currently utilized drugs. Novel antimalarial drugs are urgently needed. The Plasmodium Kinesin-5 mechanoenzyme is a suitable “next generation” target. Discovered via small molecule screen experiments, the human Kinesin-5 has multiple allosteric sites that are “druggable.” One site in particular, unique in its sequence divergence across all homologs in the superfamily and even within the same family, exhibits exquisite drug specificity. We propose that Plasmodium Kinesin-5 shares this allosteric site and likewise can be targeted to uncover inhibitors with high specificity. To test this idea, we performed a screen for inhibitors selective for Plasmodium Kinesin-5 ATPase activity in parallel with human Kinesin-5. Our screen of nearly 2000 compounds successfully identified compounds that selectively inhibit both P. vivax and falciparum Kinesin-5 motor domains but, as anticipated, do not impact human Kinesin-5 activity. Of note is a candidate drug that did not biochemically compete with the ATP substrate for the conserved active site or disrupt the microtubule-binding site. Together, our experiments identified MMV666693 as a selective allosteric inhibitor of Plasmodium Kinesin-5; this is the first identified protein target for the Medicines of Malaria Venture validated collection of parasite proliferation inhibitors. This work demonstrates that chemical screens against human kinesins are adaptable to homologs in disease organisms and, as such, extendable to strategies to combat infectious disease.

https://openalex.org/W2152370140,"Identifying stakeholder beliefs and attitudes is critical for resolving management conflicts. Debate over outdoor cat management is often described as a conflict between two groups, environmental advocates and animal welfare advocates, but little is known about the variables predicting differences among these critical stakeholder groups. We administered a mail survey to randomly selected stakeholders representing both of these groups (n = 1,596) in Florida, where contention over the management of outdoor cats has been widespread. We used a structural equation model to evaluate stakeholder intention to support non-lethal management. The cognitive hierarchy model predicted that values influenced beliefs, which predicted general and specific attitudes, which in turn, influenced behavioral intentions. We posited that specific attitudes would mediate the effect of general attitudes, beliefs, and values on management support. Model fit statistics suggested that the final model fit the data well (CFI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.062). The final model explained 74% of the variance in management support, and positive attitudes toward lethal management (humaneness) had the largest direct effect on management support. Specific attitudes toward lethal management and general attitudes toward outdoor cats mediated the relationship between positive (p<0.05) and negative cat-related impact beliefs (p<0.05) and support for management. These results supported the specificity hypothesis and the use of the cognitive hierarchy to assess stakeholder intention to support non-lethal cat management. Our findings suggest that stakeholders can simultaneously perceive both positive and negative beliefs about outdoor cats, which influence attitudes toward and support for non-lethal management."
https://openalex.org/W1971090058,"Estrogen receptor α (ERα) mediates the effects of 17β-estradiol (E2) in normal mammary gland, and it is a key participant in breast cancer tumor development. ERα transactivation activity is mediated by the synergistic interaction of two domains designated AF1 and AF2. The function of AF2 is to recruit coactivator and corepressor proteins that allow ERα to oscillate between the roles of transcriptional activator and repressor. In contrast, the mechanism responsible for AF-1 transcriptional activity is not completely understood. In this study, we identified tristetraproline (TTP) as a novel ERα-associated protein. TTP expression in MCF7 cells repressed ERα transactivation and reduced MCF7 cell proliferation and the ability of the cells to form tumors in a mouse model. We show that TTP transcriptional activity is mediated through its recruitment to the promoter region of ERα target genes and its interaction with histone deacetylases, in particular with HDAC1. TTP expression attenuates the coactivating activity of SRC-1, suggesting that exchange between TTP and other coactivators may play an important role in fine-tuning ERα transactivation. These results indicate that TTP acts as a bona fide ERα corepressor and suggest that this protein may be a contributing factor in the development of E2-dependent tumors in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2079549787,"The Rac1/JNK cascade plays important roles in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. However, how this cascade is activated upon DNA damage remains to be fully understood. We show here that, in untreated cells, Tiam1, a Rac1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is phosphorylated by casein kinase 1 (CK1) at its C terminus, leading to Skp, Cullin, F-box-containing(β-TrCP) recognition, ubiquitination, and proteasome-mediated degradation. Upon DNA-damaging anticancer drug treatment, CK1/β-TrCP-mediated Tiam1 degradation is abolished, and the accumulated Tiam1 contributes to downstream activation of Rac1/JNK. Consistently, tumor cells overexpressing Tiam1 are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging drug treatment. In xenograft mice, Tiam1-high cells are more susceptible to doxorubicin treatment. Thus, our results uncover that inhibition of proteasome-mediated Tiam1 degradation is an upstream event leading to Rac1/JNK activation and cell apoptosis in response to DNA-damaging drug treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1966431962,"Mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) 5'-editing was first described more than 20 years ago; however, the first candidates for 5'-editing enzymes were only recently identified in a eukaryotic microbe (protist), the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. In this organism, eight of 18 mt-tRNAs are predicted to be edited based on the presence of genomically encoded mismatched nucleotides in their aminoacyl-acceptor stem sequences. Here, we demonstrate that mt-tRNA 5'-editing occurs at all predicted sites in D. discoideum as evidenced by changes in the sequences of isolated mt-tRNAs compared with the expected sequences encoded by the mitochondrial genome. We also identify two previously unpredicted editing events in which G-U base pairs are edited in the absence of any other genomically encoded mismatches. A comparison of 5'-editing in D. discoideum with 5'-editing in another slime mold, Polysphondylium pallidum, suggests organism-specific idiosyncrasies in the treatment of U-G/G-U pairs. In vitro activities of putative D. discoideum editing enzymes are consistent with the observed editing reactions and suggest an overall lack of tRNA substrate specificity exhibited by the repair component of the editing enzyme. Although the presence of terminal mismatches in mt-tRNA sequences is highly predictive of the occurrence of mt-tRNA 5'-editing, the variability in treatment of U-G/G-U base pairs observed here indicates that direct experimental evidence of 5'-editing must be obtained to understand the complete spectrum of mt-tRNA editing events in any species."
https://openalex.org/W2062194536,"Studies in rodents have demonstrated that insulin in the central nervous system induces satiety. In humans, these effects are less well established. Insulin detemir is a basal insulin analog that causes less weight gain than other basal insulin formulations, including the current standard intermediate-long acting Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin. Due to its structural modifications, which render the molecule more lipophilic, it was proposed that insulin detemir enters the brain more readily than other insulins. The aim of this study was to investigate whether insulin detemir treatment differentially modifies brain activation in response to food stimuli as compared to NPH insulin. In addition, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) insulin levels were measured after both treatments. Brain responses to viewing food and non-food pictures were measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in 32 type 1 diabetic patients, after each of two 12-week treatment periods with insulin detemir and NPH insulin, respectively, both combined with prandial insulin aspart. CSF insulin levels were determined in a subgroup. Insulin detemir decreased body weight by 0.8 kg and NPH insulin increased weight by 0.5 kg (p = 0.02 for difference), while both treatments resulted in similar glycemic control. After treatment with insulin detemir, as compared to NPH insulin, brain activation was significantly lower in bilateral insula in response to visual food stimuli, compared to NPH (p = 0.02 for right and p = 0.05 for left insula). Also, CSF insulin levels were higher compared to those with NPH insulin treatment (p = 0.003). Our findings support the hypothesis that in type 1 diabetic patients, the weight sparing effect of insulin detemir may be mediated by its enhanced action on the central nervous system, resulting in blunted activation in bilateral insula, an appetite-regulating brain region, in response to food stimuli.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00626080."
https://openalex.org/W2069262834,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory tract infection in infants and young children worldwide, but currently no safe and effective vaccine is available. The RSV G glycoprotein (RSVG), a major attachment protein, is an important target for the induction of protective immune responses during RSV infection. However, it has been thought that a CD4+ T cell epitope (a.a. 183-195) within RSVG is associated with pathogenic pulmonary eosinophilia. To develop safe and effective RSV vaccine using RSV G protein core fragment (Gcf), several Gcf variants resulting from modification to CD4+ T cell epitope were constructed. Mice were immunized with each variant Gcf, and the levels of RSV-specific serum IgG were measured. At day 4 post-challenge with RSV subtype A or B, lung viral titers and pulmonary eosinophilia were determined and changes in body weight were monitored. With wild type Gcf derived from RSV A2 (wtAGcf), although RSV A subtype-specific immune responses were induced, vaccine-enhanced disease characterized by excessive pulmonary eosinophil recruitment and body weight loss were evident, whereas wtGcf from RSV B1 (wtBGcf) induced RSV B subtype-specific immune responses without the signs of vaccine-enhanced disease. Mice immunized with Th-mGcf, a fusion protein consisting CD4+ T cell epitope from RSV F (F51-66) conjugated to mGcf that contains alanine substitutions at a.a. position 185 and 188, showed higher levels of RSV-specific IgG response than mice immunized with mGcf. Both wtAGcf and Th-mGcf provided complete protection against RSV A2 and partial protection against RSV B. Importantly, mice immunized with Th-mGcf did not develop vaccine-enhanced disease following RSV challenge. Immunization of Th-mGcf provided protection against RSV infection without the symptom of vaccine-enhanced disease. Our study provides a novel strategy to develop a safe and effective mucosal RSV vaccine by manipulating the CD4+ T cell epitope within RSV G protein."
https://openalex.org/W2011457592,"Mycobacterium chelonae is a rapidly growing mycobacterial opportunistic pathogen closely related to Mycobacterium abscessus that causes cornea, skin and soft tissue infections in humans. Although M. chelonae and the emerging mycobacterial pathogen M. abscessus have long been considered to belong to the same species, these two microorganisms considerably differ in terms of optimum growth temperature, drug susceptibility, pathogenicity and the types of infection they cause. The whole genome sequencing of clinical isolates of M. chelonae and M. abscessus is opening the way to comparative studies aimed at understanding the biology of these pathogens and elucidating the molecular bases of their pathogenicity and biocide resistance. Key to the validation of the numerous hypotheses that this approach will raise, however, is the availability of genetic tools allowing for the expression and targeted mutagenesis of genes in these species. While homologous recombination systems have recently been described for M. abscessus, genetic tools are lacking for M. chelonae. We here show that two different allelic replacement methods, one based on mycobacteriophage-encoded recombinases and the other on a temperature-sensitive plasmid harboring the counterselectable marker sacB, can be used to efficiently disrupt genes in this species. Knock-out mutants for each of the three porin genes of M. chelonae ATCC 35752 were constructed using both methodologies, one of which displays a significantly reduced glucose uptake rate consistent with decreased porin expression."
https://openalex.org/W2015771186,"Objective Functional trans-generational and parental effects are potentially important determinants of health in several mammals. For humans, the existing evidence is weak. We investigate whether disease exposure triggers functional trans-generational response effects among humans by analyzing siblings who were conceived under different disease loads, and comparing their mortality in later epidemics. Under functional trans-generational response mechanisms, we expect that those who were conceived under high pathogenic stress load will have relatively low mortality during a later epidemic. Methods We use data from the Registre de la Population du Québec Ancien, which covers the historical population living in St. Lawrence Valley, Québec, Canada. Children born in 1705–1724 were grouped according to their exposure during conception to the measles 1714–15 epidemic. The 1714–15 epidemic was followed by two mortality crises in 1729–1734. The cause of the first crises in 1729 is not exactly known. The second crisis in 1732 was caused by a smallpox epidemic. Using proportional hazard Cox regression models with multivariate adjustment and with fixed-effects approach that compare siblings, we analyze whether mortality in 1729–1734 is affected by exposure to the 1714–15 epidemic. Results Children who were conceived during the peak of the measles epidemic of 1714–15 exhibited significantly lower mortality during the 1729–1734 crisis than those who were born before the 1714–15 epidemic (mortality hazard ratio 0.106, p<.05 in multivariate adjusted models; 0.142 p<.1 in sibling comparison models). Conclusions The results are consistent with a trans-generational mechanism that functionally responds to pathogen stress and suggest that early disease exposure may be protective later in life. Alternative explanations for the mortality patterns are discussed and shown to be problematic."
