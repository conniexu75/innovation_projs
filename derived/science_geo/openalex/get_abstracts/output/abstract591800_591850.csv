https://openalex.org/W2736876412,"People’s inability to update their memories in light of corrective information may have important public health consequences, as in the case of vaccination choice. In the present study, we compare three potentially effective strategies in vaccine promotion: one contrasting myths vs. facts, one employing fact and icon boxes, and one showing images of non-vaccinated sick children. Beliefs in the autism/vaccines link and in vaccines side effects, along with intention to vaccinate a future child, were evaluated both immediately after the correction intervention and after a 7-day delay to reveal possible backfire effects. Results show that existing strategies to correct vaccine misinformation are ineffective and often backfire, resulting in the unintended opposite effect, reinforcing ill-founded beliefs about vaccination and reducing intentions to vaccinate. The implications for research on vaccines misinformation and recommendations for progress are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2740653964,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains one of the most challenging solid tumors to treat with a high unmet medical need as patients poorly respond to standard-of-care-therapies. Prominent desmoplastic reaction involving cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and the immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and their cross-talk play a significant role in tumor immune escape and progression. To identify the key cellular mechanisms induce an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, we established 3D co-culture model with pancreatic cancer cells, CAFs and monocytes. Using this model, we analyzed the influence of tumor cells and fibroblasts on monocytes and their immune suppressive phenotype. Phenotypic characterization of the monocytes after 3D co-culture with tumor/fibroblast spheroids was performed by analyzing the expression of defined cell surface markers and soluble factors. Functionality of these monocytes and their ability to influence T cell phenotype and proliferation was investigated. 3D co-culture of monocytes with pancreatic cancer cells and fibroblasts induced the production of immunosuppressive cytokines which are known to promote polarization of M2 like macrophages and myeloid derived suppressive cells (MDSCs). These co-culture spheroid polarized monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) were poorly differentiated and had an M2 phenotype. The immunosuppressive function of these co-culture spheroids polarized MDMs was demonstrated by their ability to inhibit CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation and proliferation in vitro, which we could partially reverse by 3D co-culture spheroid treatment with therapeutic molecules that are able to re-activated spheroid polarized MDMs or block immune suppressive factors such as Arginase-I."
https://openalex.org/W2740942691,"The zeta potential (ZP) is a parameter commonly used to characterize metal nanoparticles (NPs) in solution. Such determinations are for example performed in nanotoxicology since the ZP influences e.g. the interaction between cells and different biomolecules. Four case studies on different metal NPs (Cu and Zn NPs, and citrate capped Ag NPs) are presented in this study in order to provide guidance on how to accurately interpret and report ZP data. Solutions of high ionic strength (150 mM NaCl) induce a higher extent of particle agglomeration (elucidated with Ag NPs) when compared with conditions in 10 mM NaCl, which further complicates the prediction of the ZP due to e.g. sedimentation and broadening of the zeta potential distribution. The particle size is seldom included specifically in the standard ways of determining ZP (Hückel and Smoluchowski approximations). However corrections are possible when considering approximations of the Henry function. This was seen to improve the analysis of NPs, since there are cases when both the Hückel and the Smulochowski approximations are invalid. In biomolecule-containing cell media (BEGM), the signal from e.g. proteins may interfere with the measured ZP of the NPs. The intensity distribution of the ZP of both the blank solution and the solution containing NPs should hence be presented in addition to the mean value. Due to an increased ionic strength for dissolving of metal NPs (exemplified by Zn NPs), the released metal ions must be considered when interpreting the zeta potential measurements. In this work the effect was however negligible, as the particle size was several hundred nm, conditions that made the Smoluchowski approximation valid despite an increased ionic strength. However, at low ionic strengths (mM range) and small-sized NPs (tens of nm), the effect of released metal ions can influence the choice of model for determining the zeta potential. Sonication of particle dispersions influences not only the extent of metal release but also the outermost surface oxide composition, which often results in an increased ZP. Surface compositional changes were illustrated for sonicated and non-sonicated Cu NPs. In all, it can be concluded that accurate measurements and interpretations are possible in most cases by collecting and reporting complementary data on characteristics such as particle size, ZP distributions, blank sample information, and particle oxide composition."
https://openalex.org/W2740212488,"Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases (AID) are a rapidly expanding group of genetically diverse but phenotypically overlapping systemic inflammatory disorders associated with dysregulated innate immunity. They cause significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden. Here, we aimed to develop and evaluate the clinical impact of a NGS targeted gene panel, the ""Vasculitis and Inflammation Panel"" (VIP) for AID and vasculitis.The Agilent SureDesign tool was used to design 2 versions of VIP; VIP1 targeting 113 genes, and a later version, VIP2, targeting 166 genes. Captured and indexed libraries (QXT Target Enrichment System) prepared for 72 patients were sequenced as a multiplex of 16 samples on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer in 150bp paired-end mode. The cohort comprised 22 positive control DNA samples from patients with previously validated mutations in a variety of the genes; and 50 prospective samples from patients with suspected AID in whom previous Sanger based genetic screening had been non-diagnostic.VIP was sensitive and specific at detecting all the different types of known mutations in 22 positive controls, including gene deletion, small INDELS, and somatic mosaicism with allele fraction as low as 3%. Six/50 patients (12%) with unclassified AID had at least one class 5 (clearly pathogenic) variant; and 11/50 (22%) had at least one likely pathogenic variant (class 4). Overall, testing with VIP resulted in a firm or strongly suspected molecular diagnosis in 16/50 patients (32%).The high diagnostic yield and accuracy of this comprehensive targeted gene panel validate the use of broad NGS-based testing for patients with suspected AID."
https://openalex.org/W2740918509,"Fatigue is a common and bothersome symptom in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. The study was aimed to determine the relationship of biological and psychological factors with IBD-related fatigue.Consecutive clinically inactive IBD outpatients receiving immunosuppressants or biological drugs were enrolled between January and December 2013. Patients completed a Fatigue score (FACIT-F), various psychological, quality of life (IBDQ-9), and IBD activity scores. Biological parameters were assessed, including levels of interleukins (IL-5, IL-8 and IL-12) and micronutrients.We prospectively recruited 202 patients (28% ulcerative colitis and 72% Crohn's disease) for the study. Fatigue measured by FACIT-F score was prevalent in the studied population (54%, 96/177) and higher than in the general population. In the univariate analysis no relation was found between IL levels or micronutrient deficiencies and fatigue. Fatigue was significantly related to female sex, Crohn's disease, joint disorders, body mass index (BMI), psychological tests, thiopurine use, and anti-TNF treatment. All these variables were included in the multivariate analysis. Female sex (OR: 4.8), high BMI (OR:1.2) and higher depression rates (OR:1.2) were predictors of increased fatigue. High IBDQ-9 score (OR: 0.82) was significantly related to lower degrees of fatigue.Fatigue was prevalent in quiescent IBD patients with moderate-to-severe disease. It was associated with high levels of depression, low quality of life, and female sex. No association was found with the other biological and psychological factors evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2740307641,"The aim of this study was to examine the relationships among classical conditioning, expectancy, and fear in placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia. A total of 42 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to three groups: placebo, nocebo, and control. They received 96 electrical stimuli, preceded by either orange or blue lights. A hidden conditioning procedure, in which participants were not informed about the meaning of coloured lights, was performed in the placebo and nocebo groups. Light of one colour was paired with pain stimuli of moderate intensity (control stimuli), and light of the other colour was paired with either nonpainful stimuli (in the placebo group) or painful stimuli of high intensity (in the nocebo group). In the control group, both colour lights were followed by control stimuli of moderate intensity without any conditioning procedure. Participants rated pain intensity, expectancy of pain intensity, and fear. In the testing phase, when both of the coloured lights were followed by identical moderate pain stimuli, we found a significant analgesic effect in the placebo group, and a significant hyperalgesic effect in the nocebo group. Neither expectancy nor fear ratings predicted placebo analgesia or nocebo hyperalgesia. It appears that a hidden conditioning procedure, without any explicit verbal suggestions, elicits placebo and nocebo effects, however we found no evidence that these effects are predicted by either expectancy or fear. These results suggest that classical conditioning may be a distinct mechanism for placebo and nocebo effects."
https://openalex.org/W2741419829,"The biological diagnosis of sphingolipidoses currently relies on the measurement of specific enzymatic activities and/or genetic studies. Lysosphingolipids have recently emerged as potential biomarkers of sphingolipidoses and Niemann-Pick type C in plasma.We developed a sensitive and specific method enabling the simultaneous quantification of lysosphingolipids by LC-MS/MS: lysoglobotriaosylceramide for Fabry disease, lysohexosylceramide (i.e. lysoglucosylceramide and/or lysogalactosylceramide) for Gaucher and Krabbe diseases, lysosphingomyelin and its carboxylated analogue lysosphingomyelin-509 for Niemann-Pick type A or B, and C diseases, lysoGM1 ganglioside for GM1gangliosidosis and lysoGM2 ganglioside for GM2 gangliosidosis.The diagnostic performances were validated in plasma samples analysing a large series of patients affected with sphingolipidoses and Niemann-Pick type C disease (n = 98), other inborn errors of metabolism (n = 23), and controls (n = 228). The multiplex measurement of lysosphingolipids allowed the screening of Fabry (including female patients and late-onset variants), Gaucher and infantile Krabbe, Niemann-Pick type A/B and C diseases with high sensitivity and specificity. LysoGM1 and LysoGM2 were elevated in most of the patients affected with GM1 and GM2 gangliosidosis respectively. In amniotic fluid supernatant from pregnancies presenting non-immune hydrops fetalis (n = 77, including previously diagnosed Gaucher (n = 5), GM1 gangliosidosis (n = 4) and galactosialidosis (n = 4) fetuses) and from normal pregnancies (n = 15), a specific and dramatic increase of lysohexosylceramide was observed only in the Gaucher amniotic fluid samples.This multiplex assay which allows the simultaneous measurement of lysosphingolipids in plasma modifies the diagnostic strategy of sphingolipidoses and Niemann-Pick type C. Furthermore, in pregnancies presenting non-immune hydrops fetalis, lysohexosylceramide measurement in amniotic fluid offers a rapid screening of fetal Gaucher disease without waiting for glucocerebrosidase activity measurement in cultured amniocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2739671091,"A number of new crops have been developed that address important traits of particular relevance for smallholder farmers in Africa. Scientists, policy makers, and other stakeholders have raised concerns that the approval process for these new crops causes delays that are often scientifically unjustified. This article develops a real option model for the optimal regulation of a risky technology that enhances economic welfare and reduces malnutrition. We consider gradual adoption of the technology and show that delaying approval reduces uncertainty about perceived risks of the technology. Optimal conditions for approval incorporate parameters of the stochastic processes governing the dynamics of risk. The model is applied to three cases of improved crops, which either are, or are expected to be, delayed by the regulatory process. The benefits and costs of the crops are presented in a partial equilibrium that considers changes in adoption over time and the foregone benefits caused by a delay in approval under irreversibility and uncertainty. We derive the equilibrium conditions where the net-benefits of the technology equal the costs that would justify a delay. The sooner information about the safety of the technology arrive, the lower the costs for justifying a delay need to be i.e. it pays more to delay. The costs of a delay can be substantial: e.g. a one year delay in approval of the pod-borer resistant cowpea in Nigeria will cost the country about 33 million USD to 46 million USD and between 100 and 3,000 lives."
https://openalex.org/W2964200492,"We consider the correction of errors from nucleotide sequences produced by next-generation targeted amplicon sequencing. The next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms can provide a great deal of sequencing data thanks to their high throughput, but the associated error rates often tend to be high. Denoising in high-throughput sequencing has thus become a crucial process for boosting the reliability of downstream analyses. Our methodology, named DUDE-Seq, is derived from a general setting of reconstructing finite-valued source data corrupted by a discrete memoryless channel and effectively corrects substitution and homopolymer indel errors, the two major types of sequencing errors in most high-throughput targeted amplicon sequencing platforms. Our experimental studies with real and simulated datasets suggest that the proposed DUDE-Seq not only outperforms existing alternatives in terms of error-correction capability and time efficiency, but also boosts the reliability of downstream analyses. Further, the flexibility of DUDE-Seq enables its robust application to different sequencing platforms and analysis pipelines by simple updates of the noise model. DUDE-Seq is available at http://data.snu.ac.kr/pub/dude-seq."
https://openalex.org/W2950420995,"To facilitate high-throughput proteomic analyses we have developed a modified FASP protocol which improves the rate at which protein samples can be processed prior to mass spectrometry. Adapting the original FASP protocol to a 96-well format necessitates extended spin times for buffer exchange due to the low centrifugation speeds tolerated by these devices. However, by using 96-well plates with a more robust polyethersulfone molecular weight cutoff membrane, instead of the cellulose membranes typically used in these devices, we could use isopropanol as a wetting agent, decreasing spin times required for buffer exchange from an hour to 30 minutes. In a typical work flow used in our laboratory this equates to a reduction of 3 hours per plate, providing processing times similar to FASP for the processing of up to 96 samples per plate. To test whether our modified protocol produced similar results to FASP and other FASP-like protocols we compared the performance of our modified protocol to the original FASP and the more recently described eFASP and MStern-blot. We show that all FASP-like methods, including our modified protocol, display similar performance in terms of proteins identified and reproducibility. Our results show that our modified FASP protocol is an efficient method for the high-throughput processing of protein samples for mass spectral analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2740347232,"Introduction Circulating microRNAs (miRNA) are promising biomarkers for human diseases. Our study hypothesizes that circulating miRNA would reveal candidate biomarkers related to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and provide biologic insights into asthma epigenetic influences. Methods Serum samples obtained at randomization for 160 children in the Childhood Asthma Management Program were profiled using a TaqMan miRNA array set. The association of the isolated miRNA with methacholine PC20 was assessed. Network and pathway analyses were performed. Functional validation of two significant miRNAs was performed in human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMs). Results Of 155 well-detected circulating miRNAs, eight were significantly associated with PC20 with the strongest association with miR-296-5p. Pathway analysis revealed miR-16-5p as a network hub, and involvement of multiple miRNAs interacting with genes in the FoxO and Hippo signaling pathways by KEGG analysis. Functional validation of two miRNA in HASM showed effects on cell growth and diameter. Conclusion Reduced circulatory miRNA expression at baseline is associated with an increase in PC20. These miRNA provide biologic insights into, and may serve as biomarkers of, asthma severity. miR-16-5p and -30d-5p regulate airway smooth muscle phenotypes critically involved in asthma pathogenesis, supporting a mechanistic link to these findings. Functional ASM phenotypes may be directly relevant to AHR."
https://openalex.org/W2741737544,"Sensitive detection of water- and foodborne enteric viruses is extremely relevant, especially due to the low concentrations in which they are found. Accurate and sensitive detection of Norovirus, the primary responsible for water- and foodborne outbreaks, is of particular importance. Quantification of Norovirus is commonly performed by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). In recent years a new platform was developed, digital PCR, that quantifies without the need for a standard curve thus decreasing the errors associated with its utilization. The platform developed by LifeTechnologies, QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR is amongst the least studied digital platform and although it allows the direct detection of DNA targets it requires a two-step RT-PCR for the detection of RNA targets. In this work we developed a new protocol able to detect Norovirus using a one-step digital PCR reaction (RT-dPCR). The performance of the newly developed one-step digital PCR was compared to RT-qPCR for the detection of Norovirus genogroup I and genogroup II. The sensitivity of RT-dPCR was identical to that of RT-qPCR, and the quantitative data determined by both methods were not significantly different for most samples. This one-step absolute quantification approach is a useful tool to minimize the time spent currently using this particular platform to amplify viral RNA and to standardize quantification of enteric viruses in food and environmental samples. This study proved the usefulness of the newly developed RT-dPCR protocol for a sensitive and accurate detection of low-copy targets."
https://openalex.org/W2741800944,"The occurrence of P. verrucosum and ochratoxin A (OTA) were surveyed for 3 and 4 years, respectively. A total of 250 samples was collected from an average of 30 farms during the 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 winter seasons. Most storage bins surveyed were typically 11 m high round bins made of corrugated, galvanized steel, with flat-bottoms and conical roofs. Samples of clumped grain contained the most P. verrucosum (p<0.05, n = 10) followed by samples taken from the first load (n = 24, mean = 147±87 CFU/g) and last load (n = 17, mean = 101±77 CFU/g). Five grain samples (2.2%) tested positive for OTA, citrinin and OTB at concentrations of 14.7±7.9, 4.9±1.9 and 1.2±0.7 ng/g, with only three samples exceeding 5 ng/g. Grain samples positive for OTA were related to moisture resulting from either condensation or migrating moist warm air in the bin or areas where precipitation including snow entered the bin. Bins containing grain and clumps contaminated with OTA were studied in detail. A number of statistically-significant risk factors for OTA contamination were identified. These included 1) grain clumps accumulated around or directly under manhole openings, 2) debris and residue of old grain or grain clumps collected from the bin walls or left on storage floor and augers and 3) grain clumps accumulated around side doors. Even when grain enters storage below the 14.5% threshold of moisture, condensation and moisture migration occurs in hotspots in modern corrugated steel storage bins. Hot spots of OTA contamination were most often in areas affected by moisture migration due to inadequate aeration and exposure to moisture from precipitation or condensation. Further, we found that the nature of the condensation affects the nature and distribution of small and isolated areas with high incidence of toxin contamination and/or P. verrucosum prevalence in the grain bins examined."
https://openalex.org/W2739783034,"Increasing evidence suggests that brain signal variability is an important measure of brain function reflecting information processing capacity and functional integrity. In this study, we examined how maturation from childhood to adulthood affects the magnitude and spatial extent of state-to-state transitions in brain signal variability, and how this relates to cognitive performance. We looked at variability changes between resting-state and task (a symbol-matching task with three levels of difficulty), and within trial (fixation, post-stimulus, and post-response). We calculated variability with multiscale entropy (MSE), and additionally examined spectral power density (SPD) from electroencephalography (EEG) in children aged 8–14, and in adults aged 18–33. Our results suggest that maturation is characterized by increased local information processing (higher MSE at fine temporal scales) and decreased long-range interactions with other neural populations (lower MSE at coarse temporal scales). Children show MSE changes that are similar in magnitude, but greater in spatial extent when transitioning between internally- and externally-driven brain states. Additionally, we found that in children, greater changes in task difficulty were associated with greater magnitude of modulation in MSE. Our results suggest that the interplay between maturational and state-to-state changes in brain signal variability manifest across different spatial and temporal scales, and influence information processing capacity in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2740309898,"While grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of rodents have multiple, regularly arranged firing fields, place cells in the cornu ammonis (CA) regions of the hippocampus mostly have single spatial firing fields. Since there are extensive projections from MEC to the CA regions, many models have suggested that a feedforward network can transform grid cell firing into robust place cell firing. However, these models generate place fields that are consistently too small compared to those recorded in experiments. Here, we argue that it is implausible that grid cell activity alone can be transformed into place cells with robust place fields of realistic size in a feedforward network. We propose two solutions to this problem. Firstly, weakly spatially modulated cells, which are abundant throughout EC, provide input to downstream place cells along with grid cells. This simple model reproduces many place cell characteristics as well as results from lesion studies. Secondly, the recurrent connections between place cells in the CA3 network generate robust and realistic place fields. Both mechanisms could work in parallel in the hippocampal formation and this redundancy might account for the robustness of place cell responses to a range of disruptions of the hippocampal circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2741135905,"It has been proposed that a reduction in intracellular calcium causes an increase in intracellular cAMP and PKA activity through stimulation of calcium inhibitable adenylyl cyclase 6 and inhibition of phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1), the main enzymes generating and degrading cAMP in the distal nephron and collecting duct, thus contributing to the development and progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). In zebrafish pde1a depletion aggravates and overexpression ameliorates the cystic phenotype. To study the role of PDE1A in a mammalian system, we used a TALEN pair to Pde1a exon 7, targeting the histidine-aspartic acid dipeptide involved in ligating the active site Zn++ ion to generate two Pde1a null mouse lines. Pde1a mutants had a mild renal cystic disease and a urine concentrating defect (associated with upregulation of PDE4 activity and decreased protein kinase A dependent phosphorylation of aquaporin-2) on a wild-type genetic background and aggravated renal cystic disease on a Pkd2WS25/- background. Pde1a mutants additionally had lower aortic blood pressure and increased left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, without a change in LV mass index, consistent with the high aortic and low cardiac expression of Pde1a in wild-type mice. These results support an important role of PDE1A in the renal pathogenesis of ADPKD and in the regulation of blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2739963593,"Nanopore DNA sequencing is a promising single-molecule analysis technology. This technique relies on a DNA motor enzyme to control movement of DNA precisely through a nanopore. Specific experimental buffer conditions are required based on the preferred operating conditions of the DNA motor enzyme. While many DNA motor enzymes typically operate in salt concentrations under 100 mM, salt concentration simultaneously affects signal and noise magnitude as well as DNA capture rate in nanopore sequencing, limiting standard experimental conditions to salt concentrations greater than ~100 mM in order to maintain adequate resolution and experimental throughput. We evaluated the signal contribution from ions on both sides of the membrane (cis and trans) by varying cis and trans [KCl] independently during phi29 DNA Polymerase-controlled translocation of DNA through the biological porin MspA. Our studies reveal that during DNA translocation, the negatively charged DNA increases cation selectivity through MspA with the majority of current produced by the flow of K+ ions from trans to cis. Varying trans [K+] has dramatic effects on the signal magnitude, whereas changing cis [Cl-] produces only small effects. Good signal-to-noise can be maintained with cis [Cl-] as small as 20 mM, if the concentration of KCl on the trans side is kept high. These results demonstrate the potential of using salt-sensitive motor enzymes (helicases, polymerases, recombinases) in nanopore systems and offer a guide for selecting buffer conditions in future experiments to simultaneously optimize signal, throughput, and enzyme activity."

This study aimed to analyze the relationship between D-index and oral complications (i.e., oral mucositis [OM] and odontogenic infection [OI]) during chemotherapies for hematological malignancies.A total of 421 chemotherapeutic courses in 104 patients were analyzed. Chemotherapeutic courses in patients who finished all of the prophylactic dental treatments were defined as ""treatment Finish"". Chemotherapeutic courses in patients who did not finish prophylactic dental treatments were defined as ""treatment not-Finish"". OM was evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. D-index was compared between chemotherapeutic courses with versus without oral complications.D-index was significantly higher in chemotherapeutic courses with grade 1 or 2 OM (p < 0.001) than courses without OM. In contrast, higher D-index did not relate to the development of OI (p = 0.18). The occurrence of OI (p < 0.001) but not OM (p = 0.56) during chemotherapy was significantly higher in chemotherapeutic courses without the completion of dental intervention.Higher D-index relates to the development of OM. In contrast, OI occurs due to untreated odontogenic foci, and its occurrence does not relate to higher D-index."
https://openalex.org/W2742052119,"Influenza A viruses pose a constant potential threat to human health. In view of the innate antiviral activity of interferons (IFNs) and their potential use as anti-influenza agents, it is important to know whether viral resistance to these antiviral proteins can arise. To examine the likelihood of emergence of IFN-λ1-resistant H1N1 variants, we serially passaged the A/California/04/09 (H1N1) strain in a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3) in the presence of increasing concentrations of recombinant IFN-λ1 protein. To monitor changes associated with adaptation of this virus to growth in Calu-3 cells, we also passaged the wild-type virus in the absence of IFN-λ1. Under IFN-λ1 selective pressure, the parental virus developed two neuraminidase (NA) mutations, S79L and K331N, which significantly reduced NA enzyme activity (↓1.4-fold) and sensitivity to IFN-λ1 (↓˃20-fold), respectively. These changes were not associated with a reduction in viral replication levels. Mutants carrying either K331N alone or S79L and K331N together induced weaker phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and, as a consequence, much lower expression of the IFN genes (IFNB1, IFNL1 and IFNL2/3) and proteins (IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2/3). The lower levels of IFN expression correlated with weaker induction of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 and reduced RIG-I protein levels. Our findings demonstrate that influenza viruses can develop increased resistance to the antiviral activity of type III interferons."
https://openalex.org/W2741414216,"The developmental progression of conventional DC has been quite well defined, yet the developmental pathway of monocyte-derived, GM-CSF-driven DC is less well understood. We addressed this issue by establishing an isolation strategy that identifies five distinct GM-CSF derived cell types. Expression of Ly6C and CD115 (Csf-1R) was used to identify and isolate four populations. One of the populations could be further separated based on CD11c expression, distinguishing five populations. We further defined these cells based on expression of transcription factors and markers of early and later stages of myeloid development. These discreet developmental stages corresponded well with previously defined populations: Common Myeloid Progenitors (CMP), Granulocyte/Macrophage Progenitors (GMP), Monocytes, as well as Monocyte-derived macrophages (moMac) and Monocyte-derived DC (moDC). Finally, within the moMac population we also identified moDC precursor activity (moDP) that could be distinguished from moMac and moDC based on their level of MHC class II expression and developmental plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2740079001,"Introduction HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in connection with atherosclerosis and thromboembolic complications. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is still unclear in this group of patients. Studies on pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in the general population emphasize the role of the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, particularly the tissue factor (TF) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The effect of persistent activation of the immune system on enhanced expression of TF on the surface of monocytes in subjects infected with HIV is known to be correlated with the level of HIV RNA in blood serum. Study aim The aim of this study was to evaluate the concentration of TF and its inhibitor TFPI in blood plasma, the impact of traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors on their concentration and the impact of both markers of haemostasis on the severity of subclinical atherosclerosis as assessed by the intima-media measurement of the carotid artery in HIV infected patients. Materials The study included 121 HIV-infected people with known clinical, immunological and virological status. The control group consisted of 42 healthy individuals, selected in terms of age and sex. Results and conclusions Higher concentrations of TF occurred in HIV-infected patients with a low current plasma HIV RNA level, nadir CD4+ T-cell count and longer duration of cumulative antiretroviral treatment. In multivariate analysis, it was the length of cumulative NRTI treatment that impacted on the concentration of TF. The determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and inflammatory markers did not show any effect on the concentrations of TF. The TFPI level in HIV-infected patients was significantly higher than in the control group and was negatively correlated with the current level of HIV RNA and nadir CD4+ T-cell count, being higher in patients subjected to antiretroviral treatment. It was shown that the higher the cardiovascular risk and the higher the levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL), the higher the concentrations of TFPI observed. The levels of TF and TFPI were positively correlated with carotid intima media thickness (cIMT); in the multivariate analysis, TF, non-HDL cholesterol and lifetime smoking (pack-years) independently affected the growth of cIMT. A similar effect on cIMT was demonstrated by TFPI."
https://openalex.org/W2740825166,"Exposure to high salinity can trigger acclimation in many plants. Such an adaptative response is greatly advantageous for plants and involves extensive reprogramming at the molecular level. Acclimation allows plants to survive in environments that are prone to increasing salinity. In this study, diploid and autotetraploid Paulownia fortunei seedlings were used to detect alterations in leaf proteins in plants under salt stress. Up to 152 differentially abundant proteins were identified by Multiplex run iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic and LC-MS/MS methods. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that P. fortunei leaves reacted to salt stress through a combination of common responses, such as induced metabolism, signal transduction, and regulation of transcription. This study offers a better understanding of the mechanisms of salt tolerance in P. fortunei and provides a list of potential target genes that could be engineered for salt acclimation in plants, especially trees."
https://openalex.org/W2741408561,"Tailored, patient-centred innovations are needed in the care for persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), in particular those with insufficient glycaemic control. Therefore, this study sought to assess their biopsychosocial characteristics and explore whether distinct biopsychosocial profiles exist within this subpopulation, which differ in health-related quality of life (HRQoL).Cross-sectional study based on data from The Maastricht Study, a population-based cohort study focused on the aetiology, pathophysiology, complications, and comorbidities of T2DM. We analysed associations and clustering of glycaemic control and HRQoL with 38 independent variables (i.e. biopsychosocial characteristics) in different subgroups and using descriptive analyses, latent class analysis (LCA), and logistic regressions.Included were 840 persons with T2DM, mostly men (68.6%) and with a mean age of 62.6 (±7.7) years. Mean HbA1c was 7.1% (±3.2%); 308 patients (36.7%) had insufficient glycaemic control (HbA1c>7.0% [53 mmol/mol]). Compared to those with sufficient control, these patients had a significantly worse-off status on multiple biopsychosocial factors, including self-efficacy, income, education and several health-related characteristics. Two 'latent classes' were identified in the insufficient glycaemic control subgroup: with low respectively high HRQoL. Of the two, the low HRQoL class comprised about one-fourth of patients and had a significantly worse biopsychosocial profile.Insufficient glycaemic control, particularly in combination with low HRQoL, is associated with a generally worse biopsychosocial profile. Further research is needed into the complex and multidimensional causal pathways explored in this study, so as to increase our understanding of the heterogeneous care needs and preferences of persons with T2DM, and translate this knowledge into tailored care and support arrangements."
https://openalex.org/W2740382667,"Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is a respiratory disease commonly caused by viral infections. Physicians regularly prescribe antibiotics despite bacterial etiologies being uncommon. This is of concern, as this use adds to the selection pressure for resistance. Here we present the descriptive epidemiology of acute rhinosinusitis and corresponding antibiotic prescribing practices by Canadian outpatient physicians from 2007-2013.Diagnosis and antibiotic prescription data for ARS were extracted from the Canadian Disease and Therapeutic Index for 2007 to 2013, and population data were acquired from Statistics Canada. ARS diagnosis and antibiotic prescription rates and frequencies of antibiotic classes were calculated.Eighty-eight percent of patients diagnosed with ARS in 2013 were adults, with a greater rate of antibiotic prescriptions observed among the adults relative to the pediatric patients (1632.9 and 468.6 antibiotic prescriptions per 10,000 inhabitants). Between 2007 and 2013, the ARS diagnosis rate decreased from 596 to 464 diagnoses per 10,000 inhabitants, while the percentage of diagnoses with antibiotic prescriptions at the national level remained stable (87% to 84%). From 2007 to 2013, prescription rates for macrolides decreased from 203.5 to 105.4 prescriptions per 10,000 inhabitants. In 2013, penicillins with extended spectrum were more commonly prescribed compared to macrolides among adult patients (153.5 and 105.4 prescriptions per 10,000 inhabitants, respectively).This study is the first to describe physician antibiotic prescribing practices for treatment of ARS in Canada. Results show that antibiotic treatment for ARS represents an area for implementing antimicrobial stewardship, and through it, managing antibiotic resistance. Further work is required to better understand diagnosing practices and treatment criteria for ARS, and use this information to further assist physicians to limit unnecessary antibiotic prescribing practices."
https://openalex.org/W2741161115,"The efficacy of antiretroviral drugs is limited by the development of drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to examine HIV drug resistance following the nationwide implementation of drug resistance testing in China since 2009. We conducted drug resistance testing in patients who were already on or new to HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Shandong Province, China, from 2011 to 2013, and grouped them based on the presence or absence of drug resistance to determine the effects of age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, route of transmission and treatment status on drug resistance. We then examined levels of drug resistance the following year. The drug resistance rates of HIV patients on ART in Shandong from 2011 to 2013 were 3.45% (21/608), 3.38% (31/916), and 4.29% (54/1259), per year, respectively. M184V was the most frequently found point mutation, conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, while Y181C, G190A, K103N and V179D/E/F were the most frequent point mutations conferring resistance to the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. In addition, the protease inhibitor drug resistance mutations I54V and V82A were identified for the first time in Shandong Province. Primary resistance accounts for 20% of the impact factors for drug resistance. Furthermore, it was found that educational level and treatment regimen were high-risk factors for drug resistance in 2011 (P<0.05), while treatment regimen was a high risk factor for drug resistance in 2012 and 2013 (P<0.05). Among the 106 drug-resistant patients, 77 received immediate adjustment of treatment regimen following testing, and 69 (89.6%) showed a reduction in drug resistance the following year. HIV drug resistance has a low prevalence in Shandong Province. However, patients on second line ART regimens and those with low educational level need continuous monitoring. Active drug resistance testing can effectively prevent the development of drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2741049788,"Increased production of hydroxyl radical is the main source of oxidative damage in mammalian DNA that accumulates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) react with both nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to generate 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), both of which can be measured in the urine. Knowledge of this pathway has positioned measurement of urine 8-OHdG as a reliable index of DNA oxidation and a potential biomarker target for tracking early cellular dysfunction in AD. Furthermore, epigenetic studies demonstrate decreased global DNA methylation levels (e.g. 5-methyl-2’-deoxycytidine, 5-mdC) in AD tissues. Moreover, stress hormones can activate neuronal oxidative stress which will stimulate the release of additional stress hormones and result in damages to hippocampal neurons in the AD brain. Our previous work suggests that treating AD transgenic mice the type-1 corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRFR1) antagonist, R121919, to reduce stress signaling, prevented onset of cognitive impairment, synaptic/dendritic loss and Aβ plaque accumulation. Therefore, to investigate whether levels of DNA oxidation can be impacted by the same therapeutic approach, urine levels of hydrogen peroxide, 8-OHdG, 5-mdC and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were analyzed using an AD Tg mouse model. We found that Tg animals had an 80% increase in hydrogen peroxide levels compared to wild type (Wt) counterparts, an effect that could be dramatically reversed by the chronic administration with R121919. A significant decrease of 8-OHdG levels was observed in Tg mice treated with CRFR1 antagonist. Collectively our data suggest that the beneficial effects of CRFR1 antagonism seen in Tg mice may be mechanistically linked to the modulation of oxidative stress pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2741437760,"Background Polymerase chain reaction-based Xpert human papillomavirus (HPV) assay is a rapid test that detects high-risk HPV (hrHPV) infection. This point-of-care test is usually performed by collecting a cervical specimen in a vial of PreservCyt® transport medium. We compared HPV test positivity and accuracy between self-collected sample with a dry swab (s-DRY) versus physician-collected cervical sampling using a broom like brush and immediate immersion in PreservCyt (dr-WET). Methods In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 150 women ≥ 18 years old attending the colposcopy clinic in the University Hospital of Geneva. Each participant first self-collected a vaginal sample using a dry swab and then the physician collected a cervical specimen in PreservCyt. HPV analysis was performed with Xpert. Part of the PreservCyt-collected sample was used for hrHPV detection with the cobas® HPV test. HPV test positivity and performance of the two collection methods was compared. Results HPV positivity was 49.1% for s-DRY, 41.8% for dr-WET and 46.2% for cobas. Good agreement was found between s-DRY and dr-WET samples (kappa±Standard error (SE) = 0.64±0.09,), particularly for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL+) (kappa±SE = 0.80±0.17). Excellent agreement was found between the two samples for HPV16 detection in general (kappa±SE = 0.91±0.09) and among LSIL+ lesions (kappa±SE = 1.00±0.17). Sensitivities and specificities were, respectively, 84.2% and 47.1%(s-DRY), 73.1% and 58.7%. (dr-WET) and 77.8% and 45.7% (cobas) for CIN2+ detection. The median delay between sampling and HPV analysis was 7 days for the Xpert HPV assay and 19 days for cobas. There were 36 (24.0%) invalid results among s-DRY samples and 4 (2.7%) among dr-WET (p = 0.001). Invalid results happened due to the long interval between collection and analysis. Conclusion Self-collected vaginal dry swabs are a valid alternative to collecting cervical samples in PreservCyt solution for HPV testing with the Xpert HPV assay. Impact HPV self-collection with dry cotton swabs might assist in the implementation of an effective screening strategy in developing countries.

https://openalex.org/W2741893204,"Classic methods for assessing cerebral autoregulation involve a transfer function analysis performed using the Fourier transform to quantify relationship between fluctuations in arterial blood pressure (ABP) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV). This approach usually assumes the signals and the system to be stationary. Such an presumption is restrictive and may lead to unreliable results. The aim of this study is to present an alternative method that accounts for intrinsic non-stationarity of cerebral autoregulation and the signals used for its assessment.Continuous recording of CBFV, ABP, ECG, and end-tidal CO2 were performed in 50 young volunteers during normocapnia and hypercapnia. Hypercapnia served as a surrogate of the cerebral autoregulation impairment. Fluctuations in ABP, CBFV, and phase shift between them were tested for stationarity using sphericity based test. The Zhao-Atlas-Marks distribution was utilized to estimate the time-frequency coherence (TFCoh) and phase shift (TFPS) between ABP and CBFV in three frequency ranges: 0.02-0.07 Hz (VLF), 0.07-0.20 Hz (LF), and 0.20-0.35 Hz (HF). TFPS was estimated in regions locally validated by statistically justified value of TFCoh. The comparison of TFPS with spectral phase shift determined using transfer function approach was performed.The hypothesis of stationarity for ABP and CBFV fluctuations and the phase shift was rejected. Reduced TFPS was associated with hypercapnia in the VLF and the LF but not in the HF. Spectral phase shift was also decreased during hypercapnia in the VLF and the LF but increased in the HF. Time-frequency method led to lower dispersion of phase estimates than the spectral method, mainly during normocapnia in the VLF and the LF.The time-frequency method performed no worse than the classic one and yet may offer benefits from lower dispersion of phase shift as well as a more in-depth insight into the dynamic nature of cerebral autoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2741839348,"Background The five-wave epidemic of H7N9 in China emerged in the second half of 2016. This study aimed to compare the epidemiological characteristics among the five waves, estimating the possible infected cases and inferring the extent of the possible epidemic in the areas that have not reported cases before. Methods The data for the H7N9 cases from Zhejiang Province between 2013 and 2017 was obtained from the China Information Network System of Disease Prevention and Control. The start date of each wave was 16 March 2013, 1 July 2013, 1 July 2014, 1 July 2015 and 1 July 2016. The F test or Pearson’s chi-square test were used to compare the characteristics of the five waves. Global and local autocorrelation analysis was carried out to identify spatial autocorrelations. Ordinary kriging interpolation was analyzed to estimate the number of human infections with H7N9 virus and to infer the extent of infections in the areas with no cases reported before. Result There were 45, 94, 45, 34 and 80 cases identified from the first wave to the fifth, respectively. The death rate was significantly different among the five waves of epidemics (χ2 = 10.784, P = 0.029). The age distribution (F = 0.903, P = 0.462), gender (χ2 = 2.674, P = 0.614) and occupation(χ2 = 19.764, P = 0.407) were similar in each period. Most of the cases were males and farmers. A significant trend (χ2 = 70.328, P<0.001) was identified that showed a growing proportion of rural cases. There were 31 high-high clusters and 3 high-low clusters at the county level among the five waves and 12, 8, 2, 9 and 3 clusters in each wave, respectively. The total cases infected with the H7N9 virus were far more than those that have been reported now, and the affected areas continue to expand. The epidemic in the north of Zhejiang Province persisted in all five waves. Since the second wave, the virus spread to the south areas and central areas. There was an obvious decline in the infected cases in the urban areas, and the epidemics mostly occurred in the rural areas after the fourth wave. The epidemic was relatively dispersed since the third wave had fewer than two cases in most of the areas and showed a reinforcing trend again in the fifth wave. Conclusions The study revealed that there were few differences in the epidemiologic characteristics among the five waves of the epidemic. However, the areas where the possible epidemic circulated was larger than reported. The epidemic cross-regional expansion continued and mostly occurred in rural areas. Continuous closure of the live poultry market (LPM) is strongly recommended in both rural and urban areas. Illegal and scattered live poultry trading, especially in rural areas, must be forbidden. It is suggested too that a more rigorous management be performed on live poultry trade and wholesale across the area. Health education, surveillance of cases and pathogenicity should also be strengthened."
https://openalex.org/W2740058437,"Purpose The aim of this study was to combine a set of methods for use of radiochromic film dosimetry, including calibration, correction for lateral effects and a proposed triple-channel analysis. These methods can be applied to GAFCHROMIC EBT3 film dosimetry for radiation field analysis and verification of IMRT plans. Methods A single-film exposure was used to achieve dose calibration, and the accuracy was verified based on comparisons with the square-field calibration method. Before performing the dose analysis, the lateral effects on pixel values were corrected. The position dependence of the lateral effect was fitted by a parabolic function, and the curvature factors of different dose levels were obtained using a quadratic formula. After lateral effect correction, a triple-channel analysis was used to reduce disturbances and convert scanned images from films into dose maps. The dose profiles of open fields were measured using EBT3 films and compared with the data obtained using an ionization chamber. Eighteen IMRT plans with different field sizes were measured and verified with EBT3 films, applying our methods, and compared to TPS dose maps, to check correct implementation of film dosimetry proposed here. Results The uncertainty of lateral effects can be reduced to ±1 cGy. Compared with the results of Micke A et al., the residual disturbances of the proposed triple-channel method at 48, 176 and 415 cGy are 5.3%, 20.9% and 31.4% smaller, respectively. Compared with the ionization chamber results, the difference in the off-axis ratio and percentage depth dose are within 1% and 2%, respectively. For the application of IMRT verification, there were no difference between two triple-channel methods. Compared with only corrected by triple-channel method, the IMRT results of the combined method (include lateral effect correction and our present triple-channel method) show a 2% improvement for large IMRT fields with the criteria 3%/3 mm."

Young children aged 6–59 months are recommended as one of the priority groups for seasonal influenza vaccination in China. Our study was conducted to evaluate the level of influenza vaccination coverage during 2014–15 and 2015–16 influenza seasons among kindergarten children aged 2–7 years in Xining, a low-income city of north-western China, and to explore potential factors for noncompliance associated with influenza vaccination. The coverage rate of influenza vaccination was 12.2% (95 CI: 10.6–14.2%) in 2014–15 and 12.8% (95 CI: 11.1–14.7%) in 2015–16. The low coverage rate was found to be primarily associated with the lack of knowledge about influenza vaccine in children’s parents. The most common reason for vaccine declination was the concern about adverse reactions of vaccine. Therefore tailored information should be provided by clinician and public health doctors for targeted groups through effective methods to improve public understanding of vaccination."

https://openalex.org/W2740463182,"Introduction Prognostic impact of delayed intensive care unit(ICU) admission in critically ill cancer patients remains debatable. We determined predictive factors for later ICU admission and mortality in cancer patients initially not admitted after their first ICU request. Methods All cancer patients referred for an emergency ICU admission between 1 January 2012 and 31 August 2013 were included. Results Totally, 246(54.8%) patients were immediately admitted. Among 203(45.2%) patients denied at the first request, 54(26.6%) were admitted later. A former ICU stay [OR: 2.75(1.12–6.75)], a request based on a clinical respiratory event[OR: 2.6(1.35–5.02)] and neutropenia[OR: 2.25(1.06–4.8)] were independently associated with later ICU admission. Survival of patients admitted immediately and later did not differ at ICU(78.5% and 70.4%, respectively; p = 0.2) or hospital(74% and 66%, respectively; p = 0.24) discharge. Hospital mortality of patients initially not admitted was 29.7% and independently associated with malignancy progression[OR: 3.15(1.6–6.19)], allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation[OR: 2.5(1.06–5.89)], a request based on a clinical respiratory event[OR: 2.36(1.22–4.56)] and severe sepsis[OR: 0.27(0.08–0.99)]. Conclusion Compared with immediate ICU admission, later ICU admission was not associated with hospital mortality. Clinical respiratory events were independently associated with both later ICU admission and hospital mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2741537140,"Noroviruses are the major cause of non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis in humans and livestock worldwide, despite being physically among the simplest animal viruses. The icosahedral capsid encasing the norovirus RNA genome is made of 90 dimers of a single ca 60-kDa polypeptide chain, VP1, arranged with T = 3 icosahedral symmetry. Here we study the conformational dynamics of this main building block of the norovirus capsid. We use molecular modeling and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the VP1 dimer for two genogroups with 50% sequence identity. We focus on the two points of flexibility in VP1 known from the crystal structure of the genogroup I (GI, human) capsid and from subsequent cryo-electron microscopy work on the GII capsid (also human). First, with a homology model of the GIII (bovine) VP1 dimer subjected to simulated annealing then classical molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the N-terminal arm conformation seen in the GI crystal structure is also favored in GIII VP1 but depends on the protonation state of critical residues. Second, simulations of the GI dimer show that the VP1 spike domain will not keep the position found in the GII electron microscopy work. Our main finding is a consistent propensity of the VP1 dimer to assume prominently asymmetric conformations. In order to probe this result, we obtain new SAXS data on GI VP1 dimers. These data are not interpretable as a population of symmetric dimers, but readily modeled by a highly asymmetric dimer. We go on to discuss possible implications of spontaneously asymmetric conformations in the successive steps of norovirus capsid assembly. Our work brings new lights on the surprising conformational range encoded in the norovirus major capsid protein."
https://openalex.org/W2739871473,"Loss of DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) activity in mammals results in severe combined immuno-deficiency (SCID). This SCID phenotype has been postulated to be due solely to the function of DNA-PKcs in V(D)J recombination, a process critical for lymphocyte maturation. However; we show that DNA-PKcs is required for IL-2 production via regulation of the calcineurin signaling pathway. Reducing DNA-PKcs activity in activated T cells either by shRNA or an inhibitor significantly reduced IL-2 production by blocking calcineurin activity and the translocation of NFAT into the nucleus. Additionally, we show that DNA-PKcs exerts its effect on calcineurin by altering the expression of the endogenous calcineurin inhibitor Cabin1 through activation of the kinase CHK2, a known Cabin1 regulator. The discovery of DNA-PKcs as a potent regulator of IL-2 production will drive continued investigation of small molecule inhibition of this enzyme within the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2740528360,"The depletion times of the anticoccidial nicarbazin administered individually and of nicarbazin and narasin administered in combination were evaluated by determining the presence and levels of 4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC), the marker residue for nicarbazin, and narasin residues in the muscle tissues of broiler chickens subjected to a pharmacological treatment. A high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method was used. The results showed the presence of all anticoccidial residues; however, the DNC levels were higher when the nicarbazin was administered individually than when it was used in association with narasin throughout the experimental period. After six days of withdrawal, the DNC level following nicarbazin administration alone was lower than the maximum residue level (MRL) of 200 μg kg-1. However, when the nicarbazin was co-administered with narasin, the concentrations of DNC were lower than the MRL after four days of withdrawal. These results may be justified because the dosage of nicarbazin, when administrated individually, is greater than when it is used in combination with narasin. The levels of narasin were lower than the MRL of 15 μg kg-1 throughout the evaluation period. It was concluded that nicarbazin is rapidly metabolized from the broiler muscles up to six days of withdrawal since the DNC levels were lower than the maximum residue level (MRL) and the concentrations of narasin were lower than the MRL throughout the evaluation period."
https://openalex.org/W2739668249,"A filtration devise was developed to assess compressibility of fouling layers in membrane bioreactors. The system consists of a flat sheet membrane with air scouring operated at constant transmembrane pressure to assess the influence of pressure on resistance of fouling layers. By fitting a mathematical model, three model parameters were obtained; a back transport parameter describing the kinetics of fouling layer formation, a specific fouling layer resistance, and a compressibility parameter. This stands out from other on-site filterability tests as model parameters to simulate filtration performance are obtained together with a characterization of compressibility. Tests on membrane bioreactor sludge showed high reproducibility. The methodology’s ability to assess compressibility was tested by filtrations of sludges from membrane bioreactors and conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants from three different sites. These proved that membrane bioreactor sludge showed higher compressibility than conventional activated sludge. In addition, detailed information on the underlying mechanisms of the difference in fouling propensity were obtained, as conventional activated sludge showed slower fouling formation, lower specific resistance and lower compressibility of fouling layers, which is explained by a higher degree of flocculation."
https://openalex.org/W2740971896,"While physiological responses to water immersion (WI) are well-studied, the vascular responses after WI are less understood. Fifteen male subjects performed six-hour resting thermoneutral water immersions (WI) at 1.35 atmospheres absolute for four consecutive days, with follow-up on the fifth day. Measurements included peripheral endothelial function and augmentation index (PAT, peripheral arterial tonometry), beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP, photoplethysmography), heart rate (HR), and plasma volume (PV) calculated from changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit. The reactive hyperemia index (RHI), a marker of peripheral endothelial function, increased with repeated immersions (p = 0.008). By WI2 and WI3, RHI increased 12% and 16%, respectively, compared to WI1 values, but no significant differences were detected between WI4 and WI1 for either measure. Absolute augmentation index (AI) increased by an average of 33% (p<0.001) and AI normalized for HR (AI@75) by 11% (p = 0.12) following each WI. PV decreased significantly by 13.2% following WI and remained 6.8% lower at follow-up compared to pre-WI. Systolic blood pressure significantly decreased by an average of 2.5% following each WI (p = 0.012). Compared to pre-WI HR, average post-WI HR decreased 4.3% lower (p<0.001), but increased overall by 8.2% over the course of repeated WI (p<0.001). Total peripheral resistance increased by an average of 13.1% following WI (p = 0.003). Thus, peripheral endothelial function increases after two days of WI, and PAT-derived measures of arterial stiffness increase transiently post-WI. Additionally, BP and PAT-derived endothelial function diverge from their usual associations with arterial stiffness (i.e. augmentation index) in the context of WI."
https://openalex.org/W2741033729,"Chrysodeixis chalcites, an important pest of banana crops on the Canary Islands, is usually controlled by chemical insecticides. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the most prevalent isolate of the Chrysodeixis chalcites nucleopolyhedrovirus (ChchNPV, Baculoviridae) as a biological insecticide. Overall the prevalence of ChchNPV infection in C. chalcites populations was 2.3% (103 infected larvae out of 4,438 sampled), but varied from 0–4.8% on Tenerife and was usually low (0–2%) on the other islands. On Tenerife, infected larvae were present at 11 out of 17 plantations sampled. The prevalence of infection in larvae on bananas grown under greenhouse structures was significantly higher (3%) than in open-field sites (1.4%). The ChchNPV-TF1 isolate was the most abundant and widespread of four genetic variants of the virus. Application of 1.0x109 viral occlusion bodies (OBs)/l of ChchNPV-TF1 significantly reduced C. chalcites foliar damage in young banana plants as did commonly used pesticides, both in greenhouse and open-field sites. The insecticidal efficacy of ChchNPV-TF1 was similar to that of indoxacarb and a Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-based insecticide in one year of trials and similar to Bt in the following year of trails in greenhouse and field crops. However, larvae collected at different time intervals following virus treatments and reared in the laboratory experienced 2–7 fold more mortality than insects from conventional insecticide treatments. This suggests that the acquisition of lethal dose occurred over an extended period (up to 7 days) compared to a brief peak in larvae on plants treated with conventional insecticides. These results should prove useful for the registration of a ChchNPV-based insecticide for integrated management of this pest in banana crops on the Canary Islands."
https://openalex.org/W2741871412,"Multipath signal is often considered an interference that must be removed. The coherence between multipath and direct component makes it difficult to use conventional direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation methods in a smart antenna system. This study demonstrates a new multipath signal DOA estimation technique. Unlike the common methods, without decoherence preprocessing, the proposed algorithm first apply a complex fast independent component analysis (cFastICA) algorithm to obtain the steering vectors with multipath information that corresponds to each source signal. Then, according to the special structure of the obtained steering vectors and spatial sparsity of the multipath signal components, the algorithm uses the solution of the sparse signal reconstruction problem in the compressive sensing (CS) theory, and the DOA estimation of the multipath signal is translated into an l1 norm minimization problem. Finally, we search the space spectrums to acquire the DOAs for each direct component and multipath component. Comparative simulation tests and analysis prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in estimation accuracy in underdetermined conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2741915309,"This paper presents a survey on a system that uses digital image processing techniques to identify anthracnose and powdery mildew diseases of sandalwood from digital images. Our main objective is researching the most suitable identification technology for the anthracnose and powdery mildew diseases of the sandalwood leaf, which provides algorithmic support for the real-time machine judgment of the health status and disease level of sandalwood. We conducted real-time monitoring of Hainan sandalwood leaves with varying severity levels of anthracnose and powdery mildew beginning in March 2014. We used image segmentation, feature extraction and digital image classification and recognition technology to carry out a comparative experimental study for the image analysis of powdery mildew, anthracnose disease and healthy leaves in the field. Performing the actual test for a large number of diseased leaves pointed to three conclusions: (1) Distinguishing effects of BP (Back Propagation) neural network method, in all kinds of classical methods, for sandalwood leaf anthracnose and powdery mildew disease are relatively good; the size of the lesion areas were closest to the actual. (2) The differences between two diseases can be shown well by the shape feature, color feature and texture feature of the disease image. (3) Identifying and diagnosing the diseased leaves have ideal results by SVM, which is based on radial basis kernel function. The identification rate of the anthracnose and healthy leaves was 92% respectively, and that of powdery mildew was 84%. Disease identification technology lays the foundation for remote monitoring disease diagnosis, preparing for remote transmission of the disease images, which is a very good guide and reference for further research of the disease identification and diagnosis system in sandalwood and other species of trees."
https://openalex.org/W2740801248,"Microsporidia are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms, capable of causing parasitic infections in both vertebrates and invertebrates. During the germination process, there is an increase in the osmotic pressure of microsporidian spores. As part of this study, we cloned a homologous aquaporin gene in Nosema bombycis, and named it Nosema bombycis aquaporin (NbAQP). Sequence analysis revealed that the NbAQP contains an open reading frame with a length of 750 bp and encodes a polypeptide of 249 amino acids. Amino acid sequence homology was greater than 50% that of five aquaporins from other microsporidian species. Indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) and immunogold electron microscopy showed NbAQP to be located predominantly in the spore wall of N. bombycis spores. The results of qRT-PCR analysis revealed that NbAQP expression remained high 0 h after inoculation and decreased sharply to 24 h, increased gradually from 2 days and peaked at 6 days. After expression of NbAQP in Xenopus laevis oocytes, it was observed that NbAQP can promote rapid penetration of water into oocytes. The associated permeation rate was 2-3 times that of the water-injected and uninjected oocytes. Antibody blocking experiments showed that the inhibition rate of spore germination was approximately 28% after antibody blocking. The difference in germination rate between the control group and the NbAQP group was significant (P < 0.05). This study shows for the first time that N. bombycis contains functional water channel proteins and provides a platform suitable for further research into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of NbAQP protein expression. Further study of NbAQP and their inhibitors may have significance for prevention of microsporidiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2739897718,"To evaluate the heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with multibacillary leprosy using dynamic linear and nonlinear analysis.Twenty-one leprosy patients (mean age: 39.14 ±10.58 years) and 21 healthy subjects (mean age: 36.24 ± 12.64 years) completed the sample. Heart rate variability recording was performed by a Polar RS800 CX heart monitor during a period of 15 min in the supine position and 15 min in a sitting position. Analysis of HRV was performed by frequency domain from high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) spectral indexes in absolute and normalized units. The nonlinear analysis of HRV was calculated using symbolic analysis (0V%, 1V%, 2LV% and 2UV% indexes), Shannon entropy (SE) and normalized complexity index (NCI).Linear analysis: both groups showed higher HF values (p < 0.05) and smaller LF values (p < 0.05) in supine than in sitting position. The leprosy patients showed higher LF values (p < 0.05) and smaller HF values (p < 0.05) compared to the controls on supine position. Symbolic analysis: leprosy patients had higher 0V% values (p < 0.05), smaller 2LV% values (p < 0.05) and 2UV % values compared to healthy subjects on both positions. The 1V % had higher values (p < 0.05) for leprosy patients than for controls in the sitting position. The control subjects had smaller 0V % values (p < 0.05), and higher 2UV % values (p < 0.05) in the supine position compared to the sitting position. Leprosy patients had higher 2UV index values (p < 0.05) in the supine position compared to the sitting position. In the complexity analysis, leprosy patients had smaller SE and NCI values (p < 0.05) than the control in the supine position. There was no difference between the SE and NCI values of leprosy and the control subjects in the sitting position. The control subjects had higher SE and NCI values (p < 0.05) in the supine position than in the sitting position.Leprosy patients had higher sympathetic modulation and smaller vagal modulation than controls, indicating less HRV and cardiac modulation with lower complexity. The control group displayed significant HRV differences in response to position changes while leprosy patients had fewer HRV differences after the same postural change. An analysis of HRV with linear and non-linear dynamics proved to be a reliable method and promising for the investigation of autonomic dysfunction in patients with multibacillary leprosy."
https://openalex.org/W2740196778,"This study aimed to use long-term diazoxide treatment to establish a loss-of-cardioprotection model and then perform proteomics analysis to explore which proteins of mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) are potentially involved in delayed cardioprotection. Rats received 1 to 8 weeks of diazoxide treatments (20 mg•kg-1•d-1) to establish a loss-of-cardioprotection model in different groups. Detection of serum cTnI levels and cell apoptosis assays in heart tissue were performed. Then, rats MIM after 0, 4 and 6 weeks of diazoxide treatment was isolated and proteomics analysis was performed. An invitro model of H9C2 cells was performed to explore the effects of targeted protein on delayed cardioprotection. The effect of delayed cardioprotection by diazoxide preconditioning disappeared when diazoxide treatments were given for six weeks or longer. Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 1 (UQCRC1) was identified in the proteomics analysis. UQCRC1 expression was upregulated by diazoxide treatment in H9C2 cells, and UQCRC1 down-regulation could increase the lactate dehydrogenase release and apoptosis rate after injury induced by oxygen glucose deprivation. These results showed that UQCRC1 might contribute to the loss-of-cardioprotection model induced by long-term diazoxide treatment and play a role in delayed cardioprotection."
https://openalex.org/W2741920601,"Paroxysmal (PS) and unusual symptoms (US) account for approximately 1.6% of initial manifestations of multiple sclerosis (MS) and have comparable conversion rates to clinically definite MS (CDMS) as classical bout onset symptoms (CS). However, long-term prognosis and clinical outcome of patients experiencing PS or US as first clinical manifestation are unclear.Clinical, MRI and cerebrospinal fluid data were obtained retrospectively and patients presenting with PS or US were compared to patients with CS presentation.In a cohort of 532 relapsing onset MS patients followed for a mean period of 11.4 years (SD 3.6), 10 (1.9%) patients initially presented with PS/US. PS/US patients received disease modifying treatment (DMT) in a significantly smaller proportion immediately after the first clinical symptom (30% vs. 61.7%; p = 0.021) and during the observation period (60% vs. 83.5%; p = 0.033). In multivariate models correcting for sex, age at initial symptoms, complete remission of initial symptoms, total number of T2 and contrast-enhancing lesions, presence of oligoclonal bands and DMT exposure, PS/US were not associated with lower annualized relapse rate or lower EDSS over time.In addition to a similar conversion rate to CDMS, patients presenting with PS/US at disease onset display very similar relapse and disability rates as patients with CS onset. Consequently, initial presentation with PS/US does not indicate benign or atypical MS, but requires DMT initiation based on the same criteria as in CS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2740365792,"Breast cancer metastasizes to bone in the majority of patients with advanced disease. We investigated the effects of inadequate dietary calcium (Ca) on bone turnover, tumor growth, and bone response to tumor in tibia inoculated with 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells. Nine-month-old female Balb/c mice were placed on an adequate Ca (5 g/kg diet, n = 30) or low Ca (80 mg/kg diet, n = 31) diet for 14 days, then injected intratibially with 1,000 4T1 cells (transfected with luciferase for bioluminescence imaging), and sacrificed at 5, 10, or 21 days post-inoculation (n = 7-10 mice/group). Control mice (n = 6/group) were injected with carrier and sacrificed at 10 days post-inoculation. Tibiae with muscle intact were excised and evaluated by microcomputed tomography and histology. In vivo bioluminescent imaging revealed that 4T1 cells metastasized to lung. Therefore, lungs were removed for quantification of tumor. Mice fed low Ca exhibited higher bone turnover and higher tibial lesion scores than mice fed adequate Ca. Lesion severity, manifested as cortical osteolysis and periosteal woven bone formation, and tumor cell infiltration to muscle, increased with time, irrespective of diet. However, for most skeletal endpoints the rates of increase were greater in mice consuming low Ca compared to mice consuming adequate Ca. Infiltration of tumor cells into adjacent muscle, but not metastasis to lung, was also greater in mice consuming low Ca diet. The findings suggest that high bone turnover due to Ca insufficiency results in greater local mammary tumor cell growth, cortical osteolysis, woven bone formation, and invasion to muscle in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2739633681,"Upwelling is the process by which deep, cold, relatively high-CO2, nutrient-rich seawater rises to the sunlit surface of the ocean. This seasonal process has fueled geoengineering initiatives to fertilize the surface ocean with deep seawater to enhance productivity and thus promote the drawdown of CO2. Coccolithophores, which inhabit many upwelling regions naturally 'fertilized' by deep seawater, have been investigated in the laboratory in the context of ocean acidification to determine the extent to which nutrients and CO2 impact their physiology, but few data exist in the field except from mesocosms. Here, we used the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (north Atlantic Ocean) Observatory to retrieve seawater from depths with elevated CO2 and nutrients, mimicking geoengineering approaches. We tested the effects of abrupt natural deep seawater fertilization on the physiology and biogeochemistry of two strains of Emiliania huxleyi of known physiology. None of the strains tested underwent cell divisions when incubated in waters obtained from <1,000 m (pH = 7.99-8.08; CO2 = 373-485 p.p.m; 1.5-12 μM nitrate). However, growth was promoted in both strains when cells were incubated in seawater from ~1,000 m (pH = 7.9; CO2 ~560 p.p.m.; 14-17 μM nitrate) and ~4,800 m (pH = 7.9; CO2 ~600 p.p.m.; 21 μM nitrate). Emiliania huxleyi strain CCMP 88E showed no differences in growth rate or in cellular content or production rates of particulate organic (POC) and inorganic (PIC) carbon and cellular particulate organic nitrogen (PON) between treatments using water from 1,000 m and 4,800 m. However, despite the N:P ratio of seawater being comparable in water from ~1,000 and ~4,800 m, the PON production rates were three times lower in one incubation using water from ~1,000 m compared to values observed in water from ~4,800 m. Thus, the POC:PON ratios were threefold higher in cells that were incubated in ~1,000 m seawater. The heavily calcified strain NZEH exhibited lower growth rates and PIC production rates when incubated in water from ~4,800 m compared to ~1,000 m, while cellular PIC, POC and PON were higher in water from 4,800 m. Calcite Sr/Ca ratios increased with depth despite constant seawater Sr/Ca, indicating that upwelling changes coccolith geochemistry. Our study provides the first experimental and field trial of a geoengineering approach to test how deep seawater impacts coccolithophore physiological and biogeochemical properties. Given that coccolithophore growth was only stimulated using waters obtained from >1,000 m, artificial upwelling using shallower waters may not be a suitable approach for promoting carbon sequestration for some locations and assemblages, and should therefore be investigated on a site-by-site basis."
https://openalex.org/W2739835542,"Our previous study has proved that the chromosome 9 open reading frame 116 (C9orf116) (NM_001106564.1) was significantly up-regulated in the proliferation phase of liver regeneration. To study its possible physiological function, we analyzed the effect of C9orf116 on BRL-3A cells via over-expression and interference technique. MTT results showed that the cell viability of the interference group was significantly lower than the control group at 48h after transfection (P<0.05), whereas it was significantly higher in the over-expression group (P<0.05). The flow cytometry results showed that C9orf116 knockdown or over-expression had little effect on BRL-3A cell apoptosis. However, the number of cells in division phase (G2/M) was significantly reduced in the interference group (P<0.05), but significantly increased in the over-expression group (P<0.01). Furthermore, the expressions of cell proliferation-related genes CCNA2, CCND1 and MYC both at mRNA and protein levels were down-regulated in the interference group and up-regulated in the over-expression group. Therefore, we concluded that C9orf116 may promote cell proliferation by modulating cell cycle transition and the expression of key genes CCNA2, CCND1 and MYC in BRL-3A cells."
https://openalex.org/W2740527125,"Reasoning with inconsistencies is an important issue for Semantic Web as imperfect information is unavoidable in real applications. For this, different paraconsistent approaches, due to their capacity to draw as nontrivial conclusions by tolerating inconsistencies, have been proposed to reason with inconsistent description logic knowledge bases. However, existing paraconsistent approaches are often criticized for being too skeptical. To this end, this paper presents a non-monotonic paraconsistent version of description logic reasoning, called minimally inconsistent reasoning, where inconsistencies tolerated in the reasoning are minimized so that more reasonable conclusions can be inferred. Some desirable properties are studied, which shows that the new semantics inherits advantages of both non-monotonic reasoning and paraconsistent reasoning. A complete and sound tableau-based algorithm, called multi-valued tableaux, is developed to capture the minimally inconsistent reasoning. In fact, the tableaux algorithm is designed, as a framework for multi-valued DL, to allow for different underlying paraconsistent semantics, with the mere difference in the clash conditions. Finally, the complexity of minimally inconsistent description logic reasoning is shown on the same level as the (classical) description logic reasoning."
