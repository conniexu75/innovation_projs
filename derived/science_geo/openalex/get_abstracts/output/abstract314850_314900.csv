https://openalex.org/W2081898489,"Unusually long reverberations were recorded from two lunar impacts by a seismic station installed on the lunar surface by the Apollo 12 astronauts. Seismic data from these impacts suggest that the lunar mare in the region of the Apollo 12 landing site consists of material with very low seismic velocities near the surface, with velocity increasing with depth to 5 to 6 kilometers per second (for compressional waves) at a depth of 20 kilometers. Absorption of seismic waves in this structure is extremely low relative to typical continental crustal materials on earth. It is unlikely that a major boundary similar to the crustmantle interface on earth exists in the outer 20 kilometers of the moon. A combination of dispersion and scattering of surface waves probably explains the lunar seismic reverberation. Scattering of these waves implies the presence of heterogeneity within the outer zone of the mare on a scale of from several hundred meters (or less) to several kilometers. Seismic signals from 160 events of natural origin have been recorded during the first 7 months of operation of the Apollo 12 seismic station. At least 26 of the natural events are small moonquakes. Many of the natural events are thought to be meteoroid impacts."

In specimens of single-crystal ice the crystal planes are revealed by evaporation, whereas polycrystalline ice develops a fibrous surface."

https://openalex.org/W2068762765,"The Antarctic surge theory of Pleistocene glaciation is reexamined in the context of thermal convection theory applied to the Antarctic ice sheet. The ice sheet surges when a water layer at the base of the ice sheet reaches the edge of the ice sheet over broad fronts and has a thickness sufficient to drown the projections from the bed that most strongly hinder basal ice flow. Frictional heat from convection flow promotes basal melting, and, as the ice sheet grows to the continental shelf of Antarctica, a surge of the ice sheet appears likely."
https://openalex.org/W2015023672,"Recent studies have shown that the remanent magnetization carried by an extrusive igneous rock may not be entirely thermal remanent magnetization (TRM). Some may be thermochemical remanent magnetization (TCRM) acquired by the rock at temperatures at least as low as 300 degrees C during oxidation of the contained titanomagnetite grains. Results from a study of a set of basaltic samples from one locality indicate that the intensity of TCRM acquired by a sample in a known magnetic field is equal to that of TRM subsequently produced in the same sample in the same field. On the assumption that the samples we studied are not magnetically unique, we tentatively conclude that paleointensity studies are valid in spite of the presence of TCRM, as long as the rock acquired the magnetization during the initial cooling."

https://openalex.org/W2090017687,"Seasonal freezing and thawing and the extreme cold of the arctic lead to the development of a variety of characteristic geomorphic features. A new one, bentonite debris flow channels, has been identified near Umiat, Alaska. These flows form when bentonite-rich Cretaceous Shales are exposed to Surface water on slopes of 5 to 30 degrees. The characteristic landform developed is a U-shaped channel 1 to 2 meters deep and from 8 to 10 meters in width. The channel shows a fluted floor and walls and is commonly flanked by a levee. The flow material is appa rently derived from the entire surface of the head portions of associated gullies. When this surface layer hydrates during snowmelt and runoff or during prolonged rain, the bentonite imbibes water and swells to a point at which its viscosity is lowered sufficiently to initiate creep or viscous flow."

The data may be taken as evidence that dark areas are, in general, relatively smooth whereas deserts are relatively rough."
