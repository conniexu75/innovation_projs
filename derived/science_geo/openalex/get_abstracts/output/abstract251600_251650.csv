https://openalex.org/W2146341872,"Store-operated Ca2+ entry is mediated by Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels following Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. We performed a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in Drosophila cells to identify proteins that inhibit store-operated Ca2+ influx. A secondary patch-clamp screen identified CRACM1 and CRACM2 (CRAC modulators 1 and 2) as modulators of Drosophila CRAC currents. We characterized the human ortholog of CRACM1, a plasma membrane-resident protein encoded by gene FLJ14466. Although overexpression of CRACM1 did not affect CRAC currents, RNAi-mediated knockdown disrupted its activation. CRACM1 could be the CRAC channel itself, a subunit of it, or a component of the CRAC signaling machinery."

https://openalex.org/W2124593509,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3-Ks) are an important emerging class of drug targets, but the unique roles of PI3-K isoforms remain poorly defined. We describe here an approach to pharmacologically interrogate the PI3-K family. A chemically diverse panel of PI3-K inhibitors was synthesized, and their target selectivity was biochemically enumerated, revealing cryptic homologies across targets and chemotypes. Crystal structures of three inhibitors bound to p110gamma identify a conformationally mobile region that is uniquely exploited by selective compounds. This chemical array was then used to define the PI3-K isoforms required for insulin signaling. We find that p110alpha is the primary insulin-responsive PI3-K in cultured cells, whereas p110beta is dispensable but sets a phenotypic threshold for p110alpha activity. Compounds targeting p110alpha block the acute effects of insulin treatment in vivo, whereas a p110beta inhibitor has no effect. These results illustrate systematic target validation using a matrix of inhibitors that span a protein family."

Whether lamin A plays any role in normal aging is unknown. We show that the same molecular mechanism responsible for HGPS is active in healthy cells. Cell nuclei from old individuals acquire defects similar to those of HGPS patient cells, including changes in histone modifications and increased DNA damage. Age-related nuclear defects are caused by sporadic use, in healthy individuals, of the same cryptic splice site in lamin A whose constitutive activation causes HGPS. Inhibition of this splice site reverses the nuclear defects associated with aging. These observations implicate lamin A in physiological aging."
https://openalex.org/W2093016244,"Within-species genetic diversity is thought to reflect population size, history, ecology, and ability to adapt. Using a comprehensive collection of polymorphism data sets covering ∼3000 animal species, we show that the widely used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) marker does not reflect species abundance or ecology: mtDNA diversity is not higher in invertebrates than in vertebrates, in marine than in terrestrial species, or in small than in large organisms. Nuclear loci, in contrast, fit these intuitive expectations. The unexpected mitochondrial diversity distribution is explained by recurrent adaptive evolution, challenging the neutral theory of molecular evolution and questioning the relevance of mtDNA in biodiversity and conservation studies."
https://openalex.org/W2159916488,"With the use of synthetic biology, we reduced the Escherichia coli K-12 genome by making planned, precise deletions. The multiple-deletion series (MDS) strains, with genome reductions up to 15%, were designed by identifying nonessential genes and sequences for elimination, including recombinogenic or mobile DNA and cryptic virulence genes, while preserving good growth profiles and protein production. Genome reduction also led to unanticipated beneficial properties: high electroporation efficiency and accurate propagation of recombinant genes and plasmids that were unstable in other strains. Eradication of stress-induced transposition evidently stabilized the MDS genomes and provided some of the new properties."
https://openalex.org/W2100948166,"Accumulation of misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers an adaptive stress response—termed the unfolded protein response (UPR)—mediated by the ER transmembrane protein kinase and endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme–1α (IRE1α). We investigated UPR signaling events in mice in the absence of the proapoptotic BCL-2 family members BAX and BAK [double knockout (DKO)]. DKO mice responded abnormally to tunicamycin-induced ER stress in the liver, with extensive tissue damage and decreased expression of the IRE1 substrate X-box–binding protein 1 and its target genes. ER-stressed DKO cells showed deficient IRE1α signaling. BAX and BAK formed a protein complex with the cytosolic domain of IRE1α that was essential for IRE1α activation. Thus, BAX and BAK function at the ER membrane to activate IRE1α signaling and to provide a physical link between members of the core apoptotic pathway and the UPR."

The artificial ommatidium, like that of an insect's compound eyes, consists of a refractive polymer microlens, a light-guiding polymer cone, and a self-aligned waveguide to collect light with a small angular acceptance. The ommatidia are omnidirectionally arranged along a hemispherical polymer dome such that they provide a wide field of view similar to that of a natural compound eye. The spherical configuration of the microlenses is accomplished by reconfigurable microtemplating, that is, polymer replication using the deformed elastomer membrane with microlens patterns. The formation of polymer waveguides self-aligned with microlenses is also realized by a self-writing process in a photosensitive polymer resin. The angular acceptance is directly measured by three-dimensional optical sectioning with a confocal microscope, and the detailed optical characteristics are studied in comparison with a natural compound eye."

https://openalex.org/W2061414976,"Rice blast is caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea , which elaborates specialized infection cells called appressoria to penetrate the tough outer cuticle of the rice plant Oryza sativa . We found that the formation of an appressorium required, sequentially, the completion of mitosis, nuclear migration, and death of the conidium (fungal spore) from which the infection originated. Genetic intervention during mitosis prevented both appressorium development and conidium death. Impairment of autophagy, by the targeted mutation of the MgATG8 gene, arrested conidial cell death but rendered the fungus nonpathogenic. Thus, the initiation of rice blast requires autophagic cell death of the conidium."

https://openalex.org/W1997794034,"Microbial pathogens that normally inhabit our environment can adapt to thrive inside mammalian hosts. There are six dimorphic fungi that cause disease worldwide, which switch from nonpathogenic molds in soil to pathogenic yeast after spores are inhaled and exposed to elevated temperature. Mechanisms that regulate this switch remain obscure. We show that a hybrid histidine kinase senses host signals and triggers the transition from mold to yeast. The kinase also regulates cell-wall integrity, sporulation, and expression of virulence genes in vivo. This global regulator shapes how dimorphic fungal pathogens adapt to the mammalian host, which has broad implications for treating and preventing systemic fungal disease."

https://openalex.org/W2131181742,"Biometals play an important role in Alzheimer disease, and recent reports have described the development of potential therapeutic agents based on modulation of metal bioavailability. The metal ligand clioquinol (CQ) has shown promising results in animal models and small phase clinical trials; however, the actual mode of action in vivo has not been determined. We now report a novel effect of CQ on amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) metabolism in cell culture. Treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing amyloid precursor protein with CQ and Cu2+ or Zn2+ resulted in an ∼85–90% reduction of secreted Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) compared with untreated controls. Analogous effects were seen in amyloid precursor protein-overexpressing neuroblastoma cells. The secreted Aβ was rapidly degraded through up-regulation of matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 and MMP-3 after addition of CQ and Cu2+. MMP activity was increased through activation of phosphoinositol 3-kinase and JNK. CQ and Cu2+ also promoted phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3, and this potentiated activation of JNK and loss of Aβ-(1–40). Our findings identify an alternative mechanism of action for CQ in the reduction of Aβ deposition in the brains of CQ-treated animals and potentially in Alzheimer disease patients.

The major constituent of AD plaques is the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), which is cleaved from the membrane-bound amyloid precursor protein (APP) (1Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3660) Google Scholar). Aggregated or oligomeric Aβ can induce neurotoxicity through pathways involving free radical production and increased neuronal oxidative stress (2Barnham K.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). Among the factors capable of promoting Aβ aggregation in vivo, recent evidence supports a central role for biometals such as Cu2+ and Zn2+ in this process (3Bush A.I. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). An important factor in controlling Aβ accumulation in AD patients is the activity of Aβ-degrading enzymes. Recent studies have identified several candidate proteases that may contribute to catabolism of Aβ in the brain. Neprilysin, insulin-degrading enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) have all demonstrated Aβ-degrading activity in vitro and/or in vivo (4Roher A.E. Kasunic T.C.

Reduced activity of these or other Aβ-degrading proteases with age may play a role in promoting accumulation and deposition of Aβ in AD patients. Development of strategies to enhance clearance of Aβ may lead to novel therapeutic treatments for AD patients. Promoting Aβ clearance may be achieved through modulating metal sequestration or metal-protein interactions. 5-Chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline or clioquinol (CQ), a disused antibiotic, has received considerable attention as a potential metal ligand in AD and Parkinson disease patients (7Kaur D. Yantiri F. Rajagopalan S. Kumar J. Mo J.Q. Boonplueang R. Viswanath V. Jacobs R. Yang L. Beal M.F. DiMonte D. Volitakis I. Ellerby L. Cherny R.A. Bush A.I. Andersen J.K.

Preliminary studies revealed that CQ rapidly and potently dissolved aggregates of synthetic or AD brain-derived Aβ in vitro (10Cherny R.A. Atwood C.S. Xilinas M.E. Gray D.N. Jones W.D. McLean C.A. Barnham K.J. Volitakis I. Fraser F.W. Kim Y. Huang X. Goldstein L.E. Moir R.D. Lim J.T. Beyreuther K. Zheng H. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Neuron. 2001; 30: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). In subsequent animal studies, a 9-week oral treatment with CQ resulted in a 49% reduction of Aβ levels and significantly increased Cu2+ and Zn2+ levels in brains of Tg2576 mice (10Cherny R.A. Atwood C.S. Xilinas M.E. Gray D.N. Jones W.D. McLean C.A. Barnham K.J. Volitakis I. Fraser F.W. Kim Y. Huang X. Goldstein L.E. Moir R.D. Lim J.T. Beyreuther K. Zheng H. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Neuron. 2001; 30: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Small clinical trials of CQ have demonstrated a significant slowing of cognitive decline together with a lowering of plasma Aβ-(1–42) levels in a subset of AD patients compared with matched placebo controls (8Ritchie C.W. Bush A.I. Mackinnon A. Macfarlane S. Mastwyk M. MacGregor L. Kiers L. Cherny R. Li Q.-X. Tammer A. Carrington D. Mavros C. Volitakis I. Xilinas M. Ames D. Davis S. Beyreuther K. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Arch. Neurol. 2003; 60: 1685-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action by CQ was suggested to be via metal sequestration, resulting in Aβ dissolution. However, CQ could also act by alternative pathways involving modulation of cellular biometal metabolism, APP expression, or Aβ processing (11Treiber C. Simons A. Strauss M. Hafner M. Cappai R. Bayer T.A. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51958-51964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To investigate this, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing APP were treated with CQ in the presence or absence of physiological levels of biometals. When CQ was added to cells in the presence of Cu2+ or Zn2+, the secreted levels of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) were dramatically reduced. Analogous effects were seen in N2a neuroblastoma cells. Subsequent investigation revealed that this effect was associated with uptake of Cu2+ and Zn2+ and loss of Aβ through increased MMP-mediated degradation. These findings identify a novel mechanism for the therapeutic efficacy of CQ in which CQ·Cu2+ or CQ·Zn2+ complexes promote Aβ degradation. Materials—CQ, bacitracin, puromycin, Me2SO, ascorbate, LY-294, 002, wortmannin, bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPS), cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin), LiCl, SP600125, staurosporine, thiorphan, and PD 98,059 were purchased from Sigma (Sydney, Australia). SB 203580, bestatin, GM 6001, phosphoramidon, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) Inhibitor IX, MMP Inhibitor I (broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor), MMP-2 Inhibitor I, MMP-3 Inhibitor I, MMP-9 Inhibitor I, Mn(III) tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin pentachloride (MnT-MPyP), and serine/cysteine protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free) were obtained from Merck Biosciences (Victoria, Australia). Anti-APP antibody 22C11 was obtained from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Antibody 369 (APP-(656–695) epitope) was a kind gift from Dr. Sam Gandy (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). Antibodies to total or phospho-specific forms of Akt, JNK, ERK1/2, p38, and GSK3 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Generation of APP-transfected CHO and N2a Neuroblastoma Cells—APP-CHO and APP-N2a neuroblastoma cells were generated by expressing the 695-amino acid APP cDNA in the pIRESpuro2 expression vector (Clontech). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 mm glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (all from Invitrogen, Mount Waverley, Victoria). Transfected cells were selected and maintained using 7.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Exposure of Cells to CQ and Metals—APP-overexpressing cells were passaged at a ratio of 1:6 and grown in 6- or 12-well plates for 2–3 days before experiments. CQ was prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in Me2SO and added to serum-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with puromycin as described above. Basal metal levels in the medium were 0.5, 1.3, and 2.1 μm for Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe2+, respectively, as determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Additional metals were added (10 μm unless stated otherwise), and the medium was briefly mixed by aspiration prior to addition to cells. Control cultures were treated with vehicle (Me2SO) alone. Inhibitors of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (LY-294,002 and wortmannin), JNK (SP600125), MEK1/2 (PD 98,059), p38 (SB 203580), GSK3 (GSK Inhibitor IX), and metalloproteases (GM 6001, phosphoramidon, thiorphan, bestatin, MMP-2 Inhibitor I, and MMP-9 Inhibitor I) were prepared as 10 mm stock solutions in Me2SO and added at the indicated concentrations. Ascorbate, MnTMPyP, bacitracin, BPS, LiCl, and MMP-3 Inhibitor I were prepared as 10 mm solutions in distilled H2O. Serine/cysteine protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free) was prepared as a 10× solution in distilled H2O. Where stated, vector only-transfected or wild-type (non-APP-overexpressing) cells were exposed to synthetic human Aβ-(1–40) with or without CQ, metals, and inhibitors (see below). Cultures were incubated for up to 6 h, and conditioned media were taken for measurement of Aβ levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell viability was determined by lactate dehydrogenase release following kit instructions (Promega Corp., Annandale, New South Wales, Australia). For immunoblotting, cells were harvested into PhosphoSafe extraction buffer (Novagen) containing Protease Inhibitor Cocktail III (Calbiochem) and stored at –80 °C until used. Alternatively, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested for analysis of metal levels by ICP-MS. ICP-MS—Cells were treated with CQ and/or metals for 6 h unless stated otherwise and washed three times with Chelex 100-treated PBS (pH 7.4). Cells were scraped into PBS; an aliquot was taken for protein determination (protein microassay, Bio-Rad); and the remaining cells were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min in a Hermle microcentrifuge (Labnet International, Inc., Edison, NJ). Metal levels were determined in cell pellets by ICP-MS as described previously (12White A.R. Cappai R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 71: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and converted to ng of metal/mg of protein. Degradation of Synthetic Aβ-(1–40)—Human Aβ-(1–40) was purchased from the W. M. Keck Laboratory (Yale University, New Haven, CT) and dissolved in Me2SO at 1 mg/ml. The dissolved peptide was further diluted into Chelex 100-treated distilled H2O at 100 ng/ml before addition to vector only-transfected CHO cell cultures in serum-free medium at 10 ng/ml without aging. In separate experiments, Aβ-(1–40) was also added to N2a mouse neuroblastoma, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma, or HeLa human epithelial cells in serum-free Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen). After 6 h (with or without addition of inhibitors and 10 μm each CQ, Cu2+, or CQ and Cu2+), the medium was collected, and the remaining Aβ-(1–40) levels were determined by ELISA. Double Antibody Capture ELISA for Aβ Detection—Aβ levels were determined in culture medium using the DELFIA® double capture ELISA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Melbourne, Australia). 384-Well plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) were coated with monoclonal antibody G210 in 15 mm Na2CO3 and 35 mm NaHCO3 (pH 9.6) for Aβ-(1–40) detection. Plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween and blocked with 0.5% (w/v) casein. Biotinylated monoclonal antibody WO2 (Aβ-(5–8) epitope) and the culture medium or Aβ standards were added (50 μl) to each well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween, and streptavidin-labeled europium (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added. The plates were washed; enhancement solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added; and the plates were read in a Wallac VICTOR2 plate reader with excitation at 340 nm and emission at 613 nm. Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) standards and samples were assayed in triplicate. The values obtained from the triplicate wells were used to calculate the Aβ concentration (expressed as ng/ml) based on the standard curve generated on each plate. We observed a good correlation between ELISA results and Western blot analysis of Aβ levels in CQ·Cu2+-treated cultures. As the ELISA offered quantitative data on Aβ levels, we chose this as the preferred method for assessing changes to secreted Aβ levels. Western Blot Analysis of Protein Expression and Phosphorylation—Cell lysates prepared in PhosphoSafe extraction buffer were mixed with SDS sample buffer (Novex) and separated on 12% Tris/glycine/SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex). Western blotting of Aβ in the conditioned medium was performed using 10–20% Tris/Tricine gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked with milk solution in Tris-buffered saline/Tween before immunoblotting for total or phospho-specific proteins. Membranes were probed for 1 h with antiserum against Aβ (antibody WO2), C-terminal APP (antibody 369), or full-length APP (antibody 22C11) at 1:2000 dilution and with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody at 1:5000 dilution. For detection of signal transduction molecules, membranes were probed with polyclonal antiserum against actin, JNK, phospho-JNK, p38, phospho-p38, ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, Akt, phospho-Akt, GSK3β, phospho-GSK3α/β, MMP-2, or MMP-6 at 1:5000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antiserum was used at 1:10,000 dilution. Blots were developed by chemiluminescence (ECL Advance, Amersham Biosciences) and imaged on a GeneGnome chemiluminescence imager (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). We found that the expression of total levels of kinases (Akt, JNK, ERK, and p38) was unaffected by metal uptake in APP-CHO cells. In contrast, actin, tubulin, and other proteins normally used for equalizing protein loading were found to be altered depending on metal levels. 5A. R. White, T. Du, K. M. Laughton, I. Volitakis, R. A. Sharples, M. E. Xilinas, D. E. Hoke, R. M. D. Holsinger, G. Evin, R. A. Cherny, A. F. Hill, K. J. Barnham, Q.-X. Li, A. I. Bush, and C. L. Masters, unpublished data. Therefore, equal sample loading and protein transfer were assessed by consistency of total kinase protein levels rather than unrelated protein levels on immunoblots. Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion to collagen type IV was determined using an InnoCyte ECM cell adhesion assay (collagen type IV; Merck Biosciences). Cells were treated with CQ, Cu2+, or CQ and Cu2+ (with or without inhibitors) for 4 h before harvesting with a rubber policeman into the culture medium. Cells were dissociated by aspiration, replated onto collagen type IV, and cultured for an additional 2 h. The medium was discarded, and cells were washed briefly with two changes of PBS before addition of calcein acetoxymethyl ester for 1 h (37 °C). Cell adhesion was determined by fluorescence spectrophotometry on a Wallac VICTOR2 plate reader with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 535 nm. MMP Assays—The activity of MMPs in the conditioned medium and cell lysates was determined using an EnzoLyte MMP fluorometric assay kit (AnaSpec, Inc., San Jose, CA). Briefly, the conditioned medium or cell lysates (freshly extracted without protease inhibitors) were incubated with MMP-specific peptide substrates following the kit instructions. The substrates used were QXL520-γAbu-Pro-Cha-Abu-S-methyl-l-cysteine-His-Ala-Dab(5-FAM)-Ala-Lys-HN2 (where γAbu is γ-aminobutyric acid, Cha is d-cyclohexylalanine, Dab is 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, and 5-FAM is 5-carboxyfluorescein; broad-spectrum substrate), QXL520-Pro-Leu-Ala-Leu-Trp-Ala-Arg-Lys(5-FAM)-NH2 (MMP-1), 5-FAM-Pro-LeuAla-Nva-Dap(QXL520)-Ala-Arg-NH2 (where Nva is norvaline and Dap is diaminopropionic acid; MMP-2), QXL520-Pro-Tyr-Ala-Tyr-Trp-Met-Arg-Lys(5-FAM)-NH2 (MMP-3), QXL520-Pro-Leu-Gly-Met-Trp-Ser-Arg-Lys(5-FAM)-NH2 (MMP-2/9), and QXL520-Pro-Leu-Ala-Tyr-Trp-Ala-Arg-Lys(5-FAM)-NH2 (MMP-8). No MMP-9-specific substrate was available. Cleavage of substrates by MMPs removed the quenching effect of QXL520 on 5-carboxyfluorescein, resulting in increased fluorescence with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 535 nm. Statistical Analysis—All data described in graphical representations are means ± S.E. unless stated from a minimum of three separate experiments. Results were analyzed using Student's two-tailed t test. CQ Mediates Uptake of Cu2+ and Zn2+ but Not Fe2+ in APP-CHO Cells—As CQ is a lipid-soluble metal ligand, we examined the effect of CQ on metal levels in APP695-transfected CHO cells (APP-CHO). Cultures were treated with CQ (10 μm) alone or in the presence of 10 μm Cu2+, Zn2+, or Fe2+ for 6 h, and cellular metal levels were assessed by ICP-MS. Basal Cu2+ levels were 4.6 ± 0.1 ng/mg of protein, and exposure to CQ alone increased this to 20 ± 3 ng/mg of protein (p < 0.01) (Table 1). Treatment with CQ and Cu2+ (CQ·Cu2+) induced a dramatic 103-fold increase in cellular Cu2+ levels (472 ± 46 ng/mg of protein; p < 0.005) (Table 1). CQ also increased cellular Zn2+ levels from 182 ± 8 to 1838 ± 64 ng/mg of protein (p < 0.001) (Table 1). Measurement of cell survival (lactate dehydrogenase release) revealed no significant effect on cell viability after 6 h of exposure to 10 μm CQ and Cu2+ or Zn2+. Treatment of cultures with Fe2+ alone (10 μm) resulted in a 16-fold increase in cellular Fe2+ levels. However, co-treatment with CQ (10 μm) and Fe2+ did not further alter cellular Fe2+ levels. Analogous effects of CQ on cellular metal levels were also observed in vector only-transfected CHO cells. CQ·Cu2+ increased CHO cell Cu2+ levels by 94.5 ± 6-fold compared with untreated controls. Treatment with CQ·Zn2+ elevated Zn2+ levels by 10.5 ± 0.4-fold.TABLE 1Metal concentrations in APP-CHO cells treated with CQ and metals for 6 hTreatmentCellular metal levels (p value compared with vehicle control)Cu2+Zn2+Fe2+ng/mg proteinVehicle4.6 ± 0.1182 ± 853 ± 5CQ (10 μm)20 ± 3 (0.01)313 ± 39 (0.05)25 ± 1Cu2+ (10 μm)24 ± 1169 ± 1048 ± 2Zn2+ (10 μm)6 ± 1190 ± 1616 ± 7Fe2+ (10 μm)4 ± 2108 ± 7845 ± 129 (0.001)CQ-Cu2+ (10 μm)472 ± 46 (0.005)85 ± 1417 ± 2CQ-Zn2+ (10 μm)29 ± 21838 ± 64 (0.001)17 ± 4CQ-Fe2+ (10 μm)3 ± 2269 ± 27889 ± 22 (0.001) Open table in a new tab CQ and Cu2+ or Zn2+ Reduce Aβ Levels in Vitro—We examined whether CQ affects Aβ generation in APP-CHO cells. Treatment of APP-CHO cultures with 10 μm CQ alone for 6 h induced no significant change to Aβ-(1–40) levels in the culture medium (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, 10 μm Cu2+ alone for 6 h induced a 35% increase in Aβ-(1–40) levels (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1A). When cultures were exposed to 10 μm CQ and 10 μm Cu2+, we observed a potent reduction (∼85%) of secreted Aβ-(1–40) levels (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1A). An analogous effect was observed upon treatment with CQ and 10 μm Zn2+ (Fig. 1A). No significant changes were observed in Aβ-(1–40) levels when cells were treated with CQ plus Fe2+ (Fig. 1A). Potent inhibition of secreted Aβ-(1–42) levels also occurred with CQ·Cu2+-treated cells (Fig. 1B). However, as Aβ-(1–42) levels in APP-CHO cells were near the detection limit of the ELISA, subsequent analysis of Aβ was restricted to Aβ-(1–40). The loss of secreted Aβ upon treatment with CQ·Cu2+ was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of the conditioned medium (Fig. 1C) and surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (data not shown). Inhibition of Aβ Can Be Induced by Low Concentrations of CQ and Cu2+—To examine the potency of CQ in inhibiting secreted Aβ levels, we treated cultures with 0.1–50 μm CQ with or without 10 μm Cu2+ for 6 h. Aβ-(1–40) was significantly decreased at 0.1 and 1.0μm CQ plus Cu2+ (Fig. 2A). We also examined the effects of different concentrations of CQ on Cu2+ uptake in APP-CHO cells. 0.1 μm CQ induced an increase of ∼25-fold in cellular Cu2+ levels (Fig. 2B). Increasing CQ concentrations resulted in further elevation of cellular Cu2+ levels, reaching 112-fold (at 50 μm) compared with control levels (Fig. 2B). The ability of low concentrations of CQ to increase cellular Cu2+ levels correlated with the potent reduction of secreted Aβ levels by CQ·Cu2+ (Fig. 2A). Although CQ has been reported to optimally bind Cu2+ at a ratio of 2:1 (13Di Vaira M. Bazzicalupi C. Orioli P. Messori L. Bruni B. Zatta P. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 43: 3795-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), our titration studies showed no significant differences in Cu2+ uptake and inhibition of Aβ levels upon varying the CQ/Cu2+ ratios. To determine the effects of Cu2+ concentration on secreted Aβ levels, cultures were exposed to 10 μm CQ with different concentrations of Cu2+. 0.1 μm added Cu2+ significantly inhibited Aβ levels (Fig. 2C). Higher concentrations of added Cu2+ further decreased secreted Aβ levels (Fig. 2C). We also examined the time course of Aβ inhibition by CQ plus Cu2+ (10 μm each). We observed an initial decrease in Aβ levels from 30 to 60 min after addition of CQ·Cu2+. A greater loss of Aβ was observed from 60 to 120 min after treatment (Fig. 2D). Examination of cellular metal levels revealed a 22-fold increase in Cu2+ after a 10-min exposure to CQ·Cu2+ (Fig. 2E). Cu2+ levels increased further at each time point, reaching a maximum level of 103-fold at 360 min (Fig. 2E). Loss of Aβ by CQ·Cu2+ Does Not Correlate with Cellular APP Levels—To further understand how CQ·Cu2+ mediates Aβ loss, we determined whether there is a corresponding loss in APP expression. Exposure to CQ alone or to CQ·Cu2+ reduced both APP expression and secretion (Fig. 2F). However, as shown in Fig. 1A, only CQ·Cu2+ inhibited secreted Aβ levels. Interestingly, there was a reduction in the α-C-terminal 83-amino acid fragment of APP (C83) upon CQ·Cu2+ treatment, although no changes in APP β-C-terminal 99-amino acid fragment (C99) expression were found (Fig. 2F). This was consistent with our observation that the activity of BACE1 (beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1) in APP-CHO membrane preparations was unchanged after treatment with CQ·Cu2+. Likewise, analysis of COS-7 cells transfected with a C-terminal APP construct (APP C99) (14Hoke D.E. Tan J.L. Ilaya N.T. Culvenor J.G. Smith S.J. White A.R. Masters C.L. Evin G.M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5544-5557Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) revealed no effect on γ-secretase cleavage of APP C99 by CQ·Cu2+.5 These findings demonstrate that the loss of secreted Aβ upon treatment with CQ·Cu2+ is unlikely to result from altered APP processing. Loss of Secreted Aβ by CQ·Cu2+ Is Mediated through Activation of JNK and ERK—Metal ligands can stimulate MAPK pathways (15Chung K.C. Park J.H. Kim C.H. Lee H.W. Sato N. Uchiyama Y. Ahn Y.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Wu W. Samet J.M. Silbajoris R. Dailey L.A. Sheppard D. Bromberg P.A. Graves L.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To examine whether the effects of CQ·Cu2+ on Aβ occur via these pathways, we treated cultures with CQ and Cu2+ or Zn2+ (10 μm each) and measured activation of JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 in cell lysates. CQ with Cu2+ or Zn2+ induced substantial activation of JNK and ERK1/2, with moderate activation of p38 (Fig. 3A). We then examined whether activation of these MAPK pathways is involved in the inhibitory action of CQ and metals on secreted Aβ levels. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 resulted in significant inhibition of JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 3B) and a significant elevation of Aβ-(1–40) levels compared with CQ·Cu2+ alone (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3B). The ERK1/2 phosphorylation inhibitor PD 98,059 (5 μm) prevented ERK activation after exposure to CQ·Cu2+ (Fig. 3C) and significantly inhibited Aβ loss (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the p38 inhibitor SB 203580 or the broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine had no restorative effect on Aβ levels (Fig. 3, D and E). JNK can be activated in response to cell stresses such as generation of reactive oxygen species or through growth factor-mediated pathways (17Liu S. Yu S. Hasegawa Y. Lapushin R. Xu H.J. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Fang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51075-51081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether JNK phosphorylation is mediated by generation of reactive oxygen species in the CQ·Cu2+-treated cultures. APP-CHO cells were exposed to CQ·Cu2+ together with the reactive oxygen species scavenger MnTMPyP (200 μm) or the antioxidant ascorbate (1 mm). Treatment with these antioxidants did not inhibit JNK phosphorylation or prevent Aβ loss in CQ·Cu2+-treated cultures (Fig. 3F). This is consistent with Zn2+ inducing effects analogous to those of Cu2+, as Zn2+ is a redox-inactive metal and should not directly stimulate reactive oxygen species generation. Therefore, the results strongly suggest that activation of JNK by CQ·Cu2+ is not mediated through metal-induced oxidative stress. Inhibition of Aβ by CQ·Cu2+ Requires Activation of the PI3K-Akt-GSK3 Pathway—Modulation of GSK3, a downstream target of PI3K and Akt activation, changes Aβ production in APP-CHO cells (18Phiel C.J. Wilson C.A. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the PI3K-Akt-GSK3 pathway is associated with the loss of Aβ production in CQ·Cu2+-treated cells. Treatment of cells with CQ and Cu2+ (10 μm each) for 6 h resulted in significant activation of Akt (Fig. 4A). Co-treatment of cultures with the specific PI3K inhibitor LY-294,002 inhibited Akt phosphorylation induced by CQ·Cu2+ and significantly abrogated the decrease in secreted Aβ levels (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4A). Treatment of cultures with 10 μm CQ·Cu2+ for 6 h increased the phosphorylated forms of GSK3α/β, and this effect was blocked by LY-294,002 (Fig. 4A). There was also a small increase in total GSK3β levels in CQ·Cu2+-treated cultures, which may partially account for the increased levels of phosphorylated GSK3. We then investigated whether PI3K-Akt-GSK3 activation is upstream of MAPK activation. Treatment of cultures with 25 μm LY-294,002 (or 10 nm wortmannin; data not shown) inhibited phosphorylation of Akt as well as phosphorylation of both JNK and ERK1/2 (Fig. 4B). Conversely, treatment of cultures with inhibitors of JNK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (SP600125 and PD 98,059 respectively) did not inhibit Akt phosphorylation (data not shown). These data demonstr"

J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). All of these genetic elements replicate by reverse transcribing their genomic RNA into a double-strand DNA. This process requires that the ends of the retroelement be composed of long terminal repeats (LTRs). For LTR-dependent endogenous and exogenous retroelements (retrotransposons and retroviruses, respectively), reverse transcription predominantly occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell. It is in this subcellular compartment that the human A3 proteins are thought to engage the retroelement as it assembles its core components into a ribonucleoprotein complex required for replication. Much of our current mechanistic understanding has been derived from studying APOBEC3G (A3G), which accesses assembling virus (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)) and virus-like (e.g. musD) particles through the Gag protein of the retroelement (2Esnault C.

Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence indicates that during retroelement reverse transcription, A3G exerts its restrictive potential by deaminating nascent cDNA cytosines to uracils (4Zhang H. Yang B. Pomerantz R.J. Zhang C. Arunachalam S.C. Gao L. Nature. 2003; 424: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 5Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D.

The uracils template the incorporation of second cDNA strand adenines and, ultimately, this mutagenic process results in a lethal level of strand-specific retroelement C/G → T/A transition mutations (hypermutations). Additional evidence indicates that several of the other human A3 proteins can also inhibit a variety of retrotransposons and retroviruses by a similar cDNA cytosine deamination mechanism (e.g. Refs. 5Mangeat B.

LTR retrotransposons such as the human endogenous retrovirus make up about 8% of the human genome, and most (if not all) of these are thought to be inactive (24International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17994) Google Scholar). In contrast, about 75% of the repetitive DNA in the human genome (34% of the total) is composed of retroelements that do not require LTRs for replication. The most prominent examples include long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1), which replicates autonomously, and Alu elements, the replication of which requires L1 protein activities (25Deininger P.L. Moran J.V. Batzer M.A. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 26Ostertag E.M. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 501-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). These elements make up 17 and 11% of the genome, respectively (24International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17994) Google Scholar). The mechanism of L1 replication is fundamentally different from that of LTR-dependent retroelements. Most importantly, L1 elements reverse-transcribe their RNA genome upon integration into the host cell nuclear DNA by a process called target-primed reverse transcription (26Ostertag E.M. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 501-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Although most of the estimated 500,000 L1 elements are incapable of mobilizing, about 100 are active, and they can compromise genomic integrity by disrupting genes, interfering with transcriptional programs, mobilizing other elements, and precipitating recombination (25Deininger P.L. Moran J.V. Batzer M.A. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 26Ostertag E.M. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 501-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). One of every 10–250 infants is estimated to contain a new L1 insertion (26Ostertag E.M. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 501-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). L1 elements can thereby cause disease and, over many generations, contribute to speciation. The cellular mechanisms that limit L1 activity are poorly understood. During A3 protein localization studies, we discovered that A3B is predominantly nuclear, in contrast to A3G, which is mostly cytoplasmic (5Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D. Nature. 2003; 424: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 27Marin M. Rose K.M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1398-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to test whether A3B could inhibit L1 retrotransposition. Using a GFP-based L1 retrotransposition reporter assay, we found that expression of A3B or A3F strongly inhibits L1 retrotransposition. Expression of the related human proteins A3D or, as shown previously (28Turelli P. Vianin S. Trono D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43371-43373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), A3G did not significantly affect the rate of L1 retrotransposition. Interestingly, the mechanism of inhibition appeared to be deaminase-independent as hypermutations were not apparent in retrotransposed L1 DNA and inhibition was still observed with a catalytically inactive A3B protein. Such a mechanism was further supported by PCR experiments showing that less integrated L1 DNA accumulated in the presence of A3B or A3F. These data combined to suggest a model in which these A3 proteins interfere with L1 transposition prior to retroelement integration. DNA Constructs—The L1 construct, pL1-ac002980-EGFP (29Brouha B.

The cDNA sequence for A3D is also called A3D-E, and it is represented by GenBank™ cDNA BE888971. Active A3B differed in eight positions from GenBank NP_004891 (K62E, L80P, F107L, T146K, M193V, D205G, T337A, and R372K). The limited number of A3B sequences in GenBank prevented us from determining whether these variations are naturally occurring. Cell Lines—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 25 units/ml penicillin and 25 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Stable, APOBEC3-expressing 293 cell lines were established by transfecting with linearized APOBEC3-HA expression constructs followed by a selection with growth medium containing 880 μg/ml G418 (Roche Applied Science). Clones expressing HA-tagged APOBEC3 proteins were identified and quantified by anti-HA (Covance) immunoblotting. Maintaining all clones in growth medium supplemented with 220 μg/ml G418 ensured stable APOBEC3 protein expression. Microscopy—Cells were visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope at ×400 total magnification. 15,000 HeLa or 50,000 293T cells were seeded on LabTek chambered cover glasses (Nunc). After 24 h of incubation, these cells were transfected with 250 ng of the pEGFP-N3-based DNA constructs. After an additional 24 h of incubation, images of the live cells were collected. 293T cells transfected with the APOBEC3-GFP constructs were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, stained with 100 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and imaged, as above. The HA-tagged APOBEC3 proteins were imaged similarly (data not shown). The A3BW228L, D316N construct was used to acquire the images presented in Fig. 1. Additional experiments using other A3B constructs have also shown a predominantly nuclear localization (data not shown). L1 Retrotransposition Assays—L1 assays were performed as originally described with minor modifications (31Ostertag E.M. Prak E.T. DeBerardinis R.J. Moran J.V. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1418-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). For each condition, 3–5 independent APOBEC3 or control 293 clones were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were transfected with 500 ng of pL1-ac002980-EGFP. After an additional 24 h of incubation, L1 plasmid-containing cells were selected with 0.67 μg/ml puromycin (United States Biological). Maintenance of the L1 substrate was ensured by the continual presence of puromycin (0.15 μg/ml) through the duration of the experiment. At 72-h intervals, the cells were passaged, and at least 25,000 cells were examined by flow cytometry. A GFP-positive region was established such that less than 0.01% of negative-control 293 cells profiled within this gate. Immunoblotting—Total cellular protein extracts were prepared using a serial freeze/thaw procedure. The extracted proteins were quantified by Bradford assays (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and probed with monoclonal anti-HA (Covance), monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Bio-Rad), or polyclonal anti-APOBEC3G (19Newman E.N. Holmes R.K. Craig H.M. Klein K.C. Lingappa J.R. Malim M.H. Sheehy A.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 166-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) or anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) followed by chemiluminescence (Roche Applied Science). L1 DNA Analyses—To ensure the exclusive amplification and detection of L1 retrotransposition events, we designed a PCR-based assay that would specifically amplify intronless GFP DNA. Most importantly, a splice-specific oligonucleotide, 5′-CAG CGT GCA GCT GGC C-3′, was designed to span the intron by annealing to exonic sequences 10 bp immediately upstream and 6 bp downstream. The GFP gene-specific annealing of this oligonucleotide would only occur if the intron were precisely spliced out, reverse-transcribed, and integrated. This primer was used in combination with 5′-CGA TCC CCT CAG AAG AAC TCG-3′ or 5′-CGA TCC CCT CAG AAG AAC TCG-3′ to generate a larger 360-bp or a smaller (semi-nested) 240-bp PCR product. E. coli Mutation Assays—The intrinsic DNA cytosine deaminase activity of several APOBEC3 proteins including APOBEC3G has been assayed by quantifying the accumulation of rifampicin resistance mutations in E. coli expressing these proteins (e.g. Refs. 18Haché G. Liddament M.T. Harris R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10920-10924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar and 30Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic localization of the human A3G protein (5Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D. Nature. 2003; 424: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 27Marin M. Rose K.M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1398-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) correlates with its ability to inhibit the replication of LTR-dependent retroelements (reviewed in Ref. 1Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Experiments designed to visualize the subcellular compartmentalization of human A3-GFP fusion proteins in HeLa cells confirmed the predominantly cytoplasmic localization of A3G, and they also showed that A3D and A3F locate similarly (Fig. 1A). In contrast, GFP alone distributed throughout the cell, and human A3B localized predominantly to nuclei (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained in human 293T cells with A3-GFP and A3-HA constructs, indicating that localization was not cell-, tag-, or fixation-dependent (Fig. 1B and data not shown). The nuclear compartmentalization of A3B suggested that it might function to inhibit replication of L1. To test this possibility, it was necessary to establish human 293 cell clones expressing near equivalent amounts of HA-tagged A3B, A3D, A3F, and A3G (Fig. 2A). It is important to note that these A3 constructs were not massively overexpressed as control immunoblots using a polyclonal antibody specific to A3G showed that the A3G-HA levels were comparable with the levels of endogenous A3G in two well studied, HIV-infectable T cell lines (H9 and CEM; e.g. Refs. 3Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Choi J.D. Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar and 14Wiegand H.L. Doehle B.P. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2451-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar and data not shown). In most instances, A3F has appeared co-expressed with A3G (12Liddament M.T. Brown W.L. Schumacher A.J. Harris R.S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1385-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 14Wiegand H.L. Doehle B.P. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2451-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), indicating that the A3F levels observed here are also not overly high. Thus, to a reasonable approximation, the stable cell lines were expressing near physiological levels of A3F, A3G, and likely also the other A3 proteins. Successful replication of an L1 element requires that it be transcribed, transported to the cytosol, assembled into a ribonucleoprotein complex, returned to the nucleus, and reverse-transcribed upon integration (26Ostertag E.M. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 501-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Plasmid-based L1 elements harboring a reporter gene in the antisense orientation, which itself is disrupted by a sense orientation intron, provide a robust system for monitoring retrotransposition in cell lines (Fig. 2B) (31Ostertag E.M. Prak E.T. DeBerardinis R.J. Moran J.V. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1418-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 32Moran J.V. Holmes S.E. Naas T.P. DeBerardinis R.J. Boeke J.D. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Cell. 1996; 87: 917-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). In the GFP-based retrotransposition system, L1 transcription, splicing, reverse transcription, and integration are necessary for GFP expression. This reporter has an advantage over drug-based selection systems because it enables measurements over extended periods of time and therefore the determination of retrotransposition rates. To assess whether A3B was able to inhibit L1 retrotransposition, the GFP-based L1 reporter construct was transfected into several independent 293 clones stably expressing a control vector, A3B, A3D, A3F, or A3G. These analyses focused on the human double cytosine deaminase domain APOBEC3 proteins because of their overall similarity to A3B and because one of them (A3G) was expected to function as a negative control (28Turelli P. Vianin S. Trono D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43371-43373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The steady accumulation of GFP-positive cells (∼1% per day) indicated that robust levels of retrotransposition occurred in 293 cells expressing the control vector, A3D and A3G (Fig. 2C; Supplemental Fig. 1). In contrast, expression of A3B decreased the rate of L1 retrotransposition by 5–10-fold. Additionally, contrary to expectations based on our A3 protein localization studies, expression of A3F also provided a similarly strong barrier to L1 retrotransposition. As an additional control for A3 protein function, we monitored the infectivity of an HIV-based retrovirus produced in the presence of each of the A3-HA constructs or in the presence of an empty control vector (Fig. 2D). As reported previously by several laboratories, the infectivity of Vif-deficient HIV was decreased strongly by A3G, moderately by A3F, and weakly by A3B (160-, 16-, and 2-fold, respectively) (e.g. Refs. 11Bishop K.N.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2451-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Expression of A3D caused little effect. These controls are important because they show that the L1 inhibition data are not simply phenocopies of the HIV restriction activities of the human A3 proteins. Moreover, these data strongly suggest that other trivial explanations for the L1 phenotype (such as nonspecific nucleic acid binding) are not likely. For instance, A3G potently restricts many LTR-dependent retroviruses (Fig. 2D) (see also Refs. 1Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 2Esnault C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and it binds single-strand nucleic acid (17Navarro F. Bollman B. Chen H. Konig R. Yu Q. Chiles K. Landau N.R. Virology. 2005; 333: 374-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), but it clearly does little to the rates of L1 retrotransposition (Fig. 2C). To begin to dissect the mechanism of L1 inhibition, we isolated a DNA cytosine deaminase-deficient A3B mutant, A3BW228L, D316N. Several previous studies have demonstrated that expression of human A3 proteins in E. coli causes a mutator phenotype, thereby providing a sensitive readout of the intrinsic DNA cytosine deaminase activity of these proteins (e.g. Refs. 18Haché G. Liddament M.T. Harris R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10920-10924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar and 30Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). E. coli expressing A3B and A3G showed, respectively, 58- and 23-fold increases in the frequency of mutation to rifampicin resistance (Rif R; Fig. 3A). In comparison, control vector- and A3BW228L, D316N-transformed cells showed much lower and nearly identical levels of RifR mutation, which were attributable to spontaneous mutations that occur during E. coli growth. The E. coli studies therefore demonstrated that A3BW228L, D316N is not able to catalyze DNA cytosine deamination and that catalytically active A3B is a potent DNA mutator. To address whether deaminase activity is required for L1 inhibition, retrotransposition assays were done using 293 clones stably expressing a vector control or A3BW228L, D316N. Interestingly, the catalytically inactive A3B protein also caused 5–10-fold reductions in the rate of L1 retrotransposition (Fig. 3B). These data indicated that the L1 inhibition activity of A3B is independent of deaminase activity. In further support of such a mechanism, retrotransposed L1 DNA showed no signs of the hallmark, strand-specific C/G to T/A transition mutations that are commonly found in A3-restricted LTR-type retroelements. Between 7 and 22 retrotransposed L1-GFP substrates were sequenced for each experimental condition, and only three base substitutions were found in 26,640 bp sequenced (see “Experimental Procedures”). In contrast, HIV experiments with A3F and A3G yielded 8 and 21 C → T transitions, respectively, per 1000 bp of viral DNA analyzed (18Haché G. Liddament M.T. Harris R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10920-10924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Finally, we noticed that the L1 PCR experiments repeatedly produced less intense or barely visible GFP-specific retrotransposition bands from the genomic DNA samples of cells expressing A3B or A3F (Fig. 3C). In many instances, an additional semi-nested PCR was required to visualize retrotransposed L1 DNA (data not shown). All of these observations combined to strongly indicate that A3B and A3F interfere with L1 retrotransposition prior to integration by a process that does not require DNA cytosine deamination. Initially, we were surprised that the L1 inhibition activity failed to correlate with obvious subcellular localization. However, the similar inhibitory potentials of A3B and A3F suggested that this activity might derive from a common domain. Indeed, these proteins are 96% identical between residues 66–190 and 65–189, respectively, whereas the remainder of these polypeptides shares less than 57% identity. It is likely that this region of concentrated identity mediates L1 inhibition. This is particularly interesting because the corresponding region of A3G is less than 50% identical, and it is required for associating with HIV-1 Gag and thereby mediating its specific encapsidation (17Navarro F. Bollman B. Chen H. Konig R. Yu Q. Chiles K. Landau N.R. Virology. 2005; 333: 374-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). By analogy, this region of A3B and A3F may mediate L1 inhibition by associating with the L1 ORF2 protein, which, like the nucleocapsid region of HIV Gag, binds both zinc and nucleic acid (26Ostertag E.M. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 501-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This ORF2 region is conserved among L1 and related elements. Thus, an A3-ORF2 association may also interfere with the mobilization of related autonomous retroelements and with some non-autonomous ones, such as Alu, because they require ORF2 for transposition. Additional studies on the mechanism of L1 inhibition are clearly warranted. As regards the physiological relevance of the L1 inhibition activity reported here, a key prediction is that A3B or A3F should be expressed in tissues in which L1 retrotransposition occurs, namely in the cells of the human germline (33Branciforte D. Martin S.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 2584-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A3B antibodies are presently unavailable, and transcripts are relatively rare as GenBank BLAST searching revealed less than six full-length A3B mRNAs and approximately 12 expressed sequence tags (mainly from cancer cells or tissues). The current lack of data and reagents prevents immediate conclusions regarding A3B. A3F transcripts have been detected in a broad number of human tissues, although mRNA from testes and ovaries was not examined (12Liddament M.T. Brown W.L. Schumacher A.J. Harris R.S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1385-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 14Wiegand H.L. Doehle B.P. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2451-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). However, the Human Protein Atlas consortium has developed a polyclonal A3F-specific antibody, and immunohistochemistry experiments involving nearly 50 human tissues revealed strong levels of A3F protein expression in spleen and testes (34Uhlén M. Björling E. Agaton C. Szigyarto C.A. Amini B. Andersen E. Andersson A.C. Angelidou P. Asplund A. Asplund C. Berglund L. Bergström K. Brumer H. Cerjan D. Ekström M. Elobeid A. Eriksson C.

Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1920-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). A subset of these images is shown in the supplemental materials, in which strong A3F expression is clearly apparent in the seminiferus epithelium region of the testes (Fig. S2). Female germ cells were not specifically examined. Nevertheless, this striking expression profile implies that A3F might constitute a male germ cell-specific barrier to L1 retrotransposition. The primate A3 proteins are under a strong positive selection (35Sawyer S.L. Emerman M. Malik H.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E275Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Taken together with the data presented here, it seems likely that one of their major, evolutionarily conserved functions is to inhibit the mobility of L1 and related nuclear retroelements. The intrinsically high level of retroelement genetic variation would thereby help select for proportionately adaptable A3 proteins, the genes of which expanded from one in rodents to seven in humans. This affords a probable explanation for why L1 retrotransposition levels are much higher in germ cells of mice than in humans (25Deininger P.L. Moran J.V. Batzer M.A. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Moreover, periodic episodes of uncontrolled mobilization, which have clearly occurred in the past for L1 (36Khan H. Smit A. Boissinot S. Genome Res. 2006; 16: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) (and which may be occurring now with HIV), may be explained by the acquisition of new retroelement genetic variations that render it A3-resistant and/or by the cross-species transmission of an element resistant to the A3 protein repertoire of the new host.

The strongest Plasmodium resistance loci cluster in a small region of chromosome 2L and each locus explains at least 89% of parasite-free mosquitoes in independent pedigrees. Together, the clustered loci form a genomic Plasmodium-resistance island that explains most of the genetic variation for malaria parasite infection of mosquitoes in nature. Among the candidate genes in this chromosome region, RNA interference knockdown assays confirm a role in Plasmodium resistance for Anopheles Plasmodium-responsive leucine-rich repeat 1 (APL1), encoding a leucine-rich repeat protein that is similar to molecules involved in natural pathogen resistance mechanisms in plants and mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2077487482,"Wnt proteins function as morphogens that can form long-range concentration gradients to pattern developing tissues. Here, we show that the retromer, a multiprotein complex involved in intracellular protein trafficking, is required for long-range signaling of the Caenorhabditis elegans Wnt ortholog EGL-20. The retromer functions in EGL-20-producing cells to allow the formation of an EGL-20 gradient along the anteroposterior axis. This function is evolutionarily conserved, because Wnt target gene expression is also impaired in the absence of the retromer complex in vertebrates. These results demonstrate that the ability of Wnt to regulate long-range patterning events is dependent on a critical and conserved function of the retromer complex within Wnt-producing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2123895632,"AtT-20 cells expressing the wild-type kappa opioid receptor (KOR) increased phospho-p38 MAPK following treatment with the kappa agonist U50,488. The increase was blocked by the kappa antagonist norbinaltorphimine and not evident in untransfected cells. In contrast, U50,488 treatment of AtT-20 cells expressing KOR having alanine substituted for serine-369 (KSA) did not increase phospho-p38. Phosphorylation of serine 369 in the KOR carboxyl terminus by G-protein receptor kinase 3 (GRK3) was previously shown to be required for receptor desensitization, and the results suggest that p38 MAPK activation by KOR may require arrestin recruitment. This hypothesis was tested by transfecting arrestin3-(R170E), a dominant positive form of arrestin that does not require receptor phosphorylation for activation. AtT-20 cells expressing both KSA and arrestin3-(R170E) responded to U50,488 treatment with an increase in phospho-p38 consistent with the hypothesis. Primary cultured astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive) and neurons (γ-aminobutyric acid-positive) isolated from mouse striata also responded to U50,488 by increasing phospho-p38 immunolabeling. p38 activation was not evident in either striatal astrocytes or neurons isolated from KOR knock-out mice or GRK3 knock-out mice. Astrocytes pretreated with small interfering RNA for arrestin3 were also unable to activate p38 in response to U50,488 treatment. Furthermore, in striatal neurons, the kappa-mediated phospho-p38 labeling was colocalized with arrestin3. These findings suggest that KOR may activate p38 MAPK in brain by a GRK3 and arrestin-dependent mechanism.

AtT-20 cells expressing both KSA and arrestin3-(R170E) responded to U50,488 treatment with an increase in phospho-p38 consistent with the hypothesis. Primary cultured astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive) and neurons (γ-aminobutyric acid-positive) isolated from mouse striata also responded to U50,488 by increasing phospho-p38 immunolabeling. p38 activation was not evident in either striatal astrocytes or neurons isolated from KOR knock-out mice or GRK3 knock-out mice. Astrocytes pretreated with small interfering RNA for arrestin3 were also unable to activate p38 in response to U50,488 treatment. Furthermore, in striatal neurons, the kappa-mediated phospho-p38 labeling was colocalized with arrestin3. These findings suggest that KOR may activate p38 MAPK in brain by a GRK3 and arrestin-dependent mechanism. Kappa opioid receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; KOR, kappa opioid receptor; KSA, kappa opioid receptor serine 369 to alanine mutant; GRK3, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 3; MEM, minimal essential medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MAPK; R170E, dominant positive arrestin3; RT, reverse transcriptase; siRNA, small inhibitory ribonucleic acid; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. that are widely expressed throughout the brain and are activated by the endogenous opioid peptides derived from prodynorphin (1Chavkin C.

Rev. 1996; 48: 568-586Google Scholar). Several reports have characterized the signal transduction events initiated by KOR activation. By coupling to the G-protein Gαi/o, KOR inhibits adenylate cyclase, increases potassium conductance, decreases calcium conductance, and mobilizes intracellular calcium (3Piros E.T. Hales T.G. Evans C.J. Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). More recently, KOR has been recognized to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1/2) (4Belcheva M.M. Clark A.L. Haas P.D. Serna J.S. Hahn J.W. Kiss A. Coscia C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27662-27669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 5Bohn L.M. Belcheva M.M. Coscia C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This activation has been demonstrated to persist for several hours following agonist treatment, suggesting a role for KOR in long term growth and gene regulation. Other studies have demonstrated that KOR can activate c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (6Kam A.Y. Chan A.S. Wong A.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 310: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that KOR can activate multiple signaling pathways that result in the immediate and long term cellular effects of kappa opioids. Sustained agonist exposure causes GPCR phosphorylation and desensitization (7Peirce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). For the kappa opioid receptor, G-protein receptor kinase 3 (GRK3) phosphorylation of serine 369 in the carboxyl-terminal domain of KOR initiates arrestin-dependent receptor desensitization and internalization (8McLaughlin J.P. Xu M. Mackie K. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34631-34640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Appleyard S.M. Celver J. Pineda V. Kovoor A. Wayman G.A. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23802-23807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, new evidence suggests that the arrestin-bound GPCR is not inactive and instead can recruit MAPK signaling modules (10Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). For example, for the chemokine receptor (CXCR4), β-arrestin2 (also called arrestin3) is involved in receptor-mediated p38 MAPK activation (11Sun Y. Cheng Z. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49212-49221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Activation of the p38 MAPK pathways has been demonstrated to play a role in the stress response, activation of apoptotic pathways, and induction of cell proliferation. To assess whether GRK-dependent arrestin association is required for KOR activation of MAPK, we compared the KOR-GFP and the GRK-resistant KOR(S369A)-GFP (KSA) expressed in AtT-20 cells. In addition, using cultured primary astrocytes and neurons from wild-type mice and mice lacking GRK3 (GRK3–/–), we assessed the role of GRK in mediating KOR activation of p38 in native cells. The results suggest that phosphorylation of KOR serine 369 by GRK and subsequent arrestin binding leads to activation of the p38 stress kinase. Chemicals—Norbinaltorphimine HCl and (–)U50,488 were obtained from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). Dynorphin B was from Bachem AG (Belmont, CA). Salvinorin A was a gift of Daniel Seibert. All other drugs were purchased from Calbiochem. Drugs were dissolved in water or ethanol (salvinorin A) unless otherwise indicated. Cell Culture and Transfection of AtT-20 Cells—AtT-20 cells expressing rat KOR-GFP and rat KOR(S369A)-GFP (KSA) were generated as described previously (8McLaughlin J.P. Xu M. Mackie K. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34631-34640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) where ≥90% of cells express the GFP-tagged receptor. KOR-GFP and KSA-GFP AtT-20 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified medium with 10% horse serum (Sigma). For experiments using the dominant positive arrestin3(R170E), KOR-GFP or KSA-GFP AtT-20 cells at ≥70% confluence were transfected with 5 μg of cDNA coding for the dominant positive arrestin3(R170E)-YFP (12Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 13Celver J. Vishnivetskiy S. Chavkin C.

BglII and KpnI restriction sites were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA through polymerase chain reaction using the respective oligonucleotides: 5′-Arr3 BglI(5′-ATGCATAGATCTATGGGGGAGAAACCC-3′) and 3′-Arr3 KpnI (5′-GGCCCGCGGTACCTAGCAGAACTGGTC-3′). The resulting product was purified, digested, and then inserted into the multiple cloning site of the pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech). The 5′ oligonucleotide used to insert the BglII restriction site ensured that the coding sequence for arrestin3 remained in-frame with the EYFP sequence; thus, the resulting construct codes for a fusion protein with an EYFP tag added to the amino terminus of the arrestin. Radioligand Binding of KOR and KSA-GFP AtT-20 Cells—KOR-GFP and KSA-GFP-expressing AtT-20 cells were grown as described above. For each membrane preparation, three 100-mm dishes with cells at 80% confluence were used. Dishes were washed twice with PBS and then scraped with a rubber policeman in 2 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) on ice. The contents of each plate were combined and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. Samples were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min, supernatant was removed, and pellet was resuspended in Tris buffer, washed, and rehomogenized. Following centrifugation, supernatant was removed, and pellet was stored at –80 °C. For saturation binding experiments membrane pellets were resuspended and homogenized in Tris buffer. Total binding of [3H]diprenorphine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (50 Ci/mmol) was determined using tubes containing 50 μg of membrane protein from KOR-GFP or KSA-GFP AtT-20 cells, Tris buffer, and [3H]diprenorphine ranging in concentration from 6 pm to 20 nm. A parallel set of tubes also contained 10 μm naloxone to define nonspecific binding. Tubes were incubated for 30 min in a 37 °C shaking water bath, and samples were filtered through a multiscreen GF/B plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Filter plates were washed and filtered three times with ice-cold Tris buffer. Radioactivity retained on filters was counted by liquid scintillation. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic assay method (Pierce) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Receptor levels and binding affinity (Bmax, Kd) for the KOR-GFP and KSA-GFP were calculated using a non-linear least squares curve fitting program (GraphPad Prism 4.0, San Diego, CA). Receptor expression levels were determined to be similar in both the KOR-GFP (Bmax 2.7 ± 0.169 pmol/mg of protein, Kd 0.40 ± 0.08 nm) and KSA-GFP (Bmax 3.3 ± 0.11 pmol/mg of protein, Kd 0.37 ± 0.11 nm) AtT-20 cell lines. Primary Cultures of Astrocytes—This protocol has been described previously (14Brewer G.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 71: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and was adapted for these studies. In this protocol, >95% of cells are glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive, indicating that the culture is primarily comprised of astrocytes. Neonatal mice (postnatal days, 1–3) were decapitated, and striata were dissected and placed in 2 ml of culture medium at 4 °C containing NeurobasalA (Invitrogen) supplemented with GlutaMAX, 2% B27, 50 units of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The striatal tissue was coarsely cut and transferred to sterile culture medium containing 40 units/ml active papain (Sigma). The cell-papain solution was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min on a platform rotating at 120 rpm. The solution was then replaced with 2 ml of culture media and triturated 15–20 times. Following settling (about 2 min), the supernatant was passed through a 70-μm nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences). This process of settling and straining was repeated twice more. Cells were then plated in 0.5 ml of culture medium at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml on 6-well plates or 12-mm glass coverslips (PGC Scientifics, Gaithersburg, MD) placed in 24-well plates (BD Biosciences). Prior to use, coverslips were acid-washed, soaked in ethanol, and rinsed in sterile water before overnight treatment with 50 mg/ml poly-d-lysine (135 kDa, Sigma). 1 h after plating and incubation (5% CO2, 95% air, 37 °C), unattached cells were aspirated, and the culture medium was replaced. Following 3–4 days in culture, plating media was replaced with complete medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA). Coverslips with astrocytes were used for immunocytochemistry 1–2 weeks after plating. 6-well plates were used for immunoblotting experiments about 21 days after plating. Striatal Neuronal Cultures—This procedure was described previously (15Macey T.A. Gurevich V.V. Neve K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1635-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and adapted for these studies. In this procedure, >90% of the neuronal cell culture stained positive for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), consistent with the endogenous neuronal populations in the striatum. The striatal region was dissected from 1–3-day-old C57BL/6 mice, incubated in media containing 20 units/ml papain and 0.5 m kynurenic acid for 45 min at 37 °C, and triturated using fire-polished Pasteur pipettes as described previously (15Macey T.A. Gurevich V.V. Neve K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1635-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine- and collagen-treated glass coverslips at a density of 75,000 cells per coverslip. Neuronal medium containing 50% minimal essential medium (MEM), 39% Ham's F12 medium, 10% horse serum, 1% fetal bovine serum, 0.45% glucose, 0.1 mg/ml apotransferrin, 0.5 mm kynurenic acid, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin was added 1 h after initial plating. Cells were grown in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C and used after 21 days in culture. Cultures of striatal astrocytes and neurons were made from neonatal KOR–/– and GRK3–/– mice on a C57Bl/6 background (Charles River Laboratories), genotyped and characterized as described previously (16McLaughlin J.P. Marton-Popovici M. Chavkin C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5674-5683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—KOR-GFP and KOR(S369A)-GFP AtT-20 cells, primary cultured astrocytes and striatal neurons were grown on poly-d-lysine coverslips in 24-well plates and placed in a 37 °C (5% CO2) incubator. After drug treatment, cells were washed three times with PBS and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed in PBS 3×, blocked for 2 h in 0.3% gelatin, 0.025% Triton X-100 in PBS (blocking buffer) at room temperature, and then incubated overnight with primary antibody in blocking buffer. The following primary antibody concentrations were used: goat-anti-rabbit phospho-p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182) MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) 1:500, guinea pig anti-GFAP (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) 1:1000. Following primary antibody exposure and 3× wash in PBS, coverslips were exposed to secondary antibody. Secondary antibody for AtT-20 cells was the goat-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For the anti-GFAP and anti-phospho-p38, donkey anti-guinea pig IgG rhodamine conjugate (1:300, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and goat-anti-rabbit IgG 488, Alexa Fluor conjugate (1:400, Molecular Probes) were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with coverslips for 1 h at room temp. AtT-20 cells were incubated with Topro3 stain (Topro3, Molecular Probes, 1:1000) for 15 min following secondary antibody incubation and then washed two times in PBS prior to mounting on slides to visualize nuclei. Striatal neurons were stained with the following antibodies. Mouse anti-phospho-p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182) primary-antibody (Cell Signaling) was used at a 1:250 dilution in PBS, guinea pig anti-GABA was used at a dilution of 1:1000 in PBS, rabbit anti-arrestin3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibody was used at a dilution of 1:300 in PBS, and the blocking buffer was composed of 5% goat-serum, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% TX-100. The secondary antibodies used for the neuronal staining were goat-anti-mouse IgG 488, goat-anti-rabbit IgG 555, and goat-anti-guinea pig IgG 633 (1:500, Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted using VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, CA) and sealed with nail polish. Fluorescent GFP signals were excited at 488 nm, Alexa Fluor 555 fluorescent signals were excited at 543 nm, and fluorescent YFP signals (excited at 440 nm-470 nm) and fluorescent Topro3 signals (excited at 633 nm) were detected and merged as appropriate. All imaging was performed at the University of Washington W. M. Keck Imaging Center for Advanced Studies in Neural Signaling. Transfection of Arrestin3 siRNA—The chemically synthesized siRNA with 19-nucleotide duplex RNA and 2-nucleotide 3′ terminal dTdT overhangs were purchased from (Invitrogen). The siRNA sequence targeting mouse arrestin3 (NM_145429) was 5′-GGACCGGAAAGUGUUUGUG-3′. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was added to OptiMEM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, whereas RNA mixtures at a final concentration of 25 nm were prepared in MEM. RNA mixtures were added dropwise to the Lipofectamine 2000 mixture and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After the incubation, the total mixture was added to cells in a 6-well tissue culture plate containing astrocytes for 4 h. Some wells received Lipofectamine 2000 only as a negative control. Additional MEM was added to each well or plate 24 h after the addition of the RNA mixtures. 24 h later, the siRNA/MEM mixture was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were harvested on the third day following transfection for quantification of phospho-p38, arrestin3, and actin immunoreactivity as described. Immunoblotting—KOR-GFP and KSA-GFP-expressing AtT-20 cells, primary striatal astrocytes, and primary striatal neurons were cultured as described above. All cells were serum-starved 24 h prior to drug treatment. Cells were treated with the appropriate ligands and time points in cell culture medium and then lysed in 350 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1:100 of phosphatase inhibitor mixture set 1 (Calbiochem), and 1:100 of protease inhibitor mixture set 1 (Calbiochem). Lysates were sonicated for 20 s and then centrifuged for 15 min (14000 × g, 4 °C), pellet was discarded, and sample supernatants were stored at –20 °C. Protein concentration was determined by Pierce bicinchoninic assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard before loading 20 μg onto non-denaturing 10% bisacrylamide precast gels (Invitrogen) and running at 150 V for 1.5 h. For determination of molecular weights, Benchmark prestained standards (Invitrogen) were loaded along with protein samples. Blots were transferred to nitrocellulose (Whatman, Middlesex, UK) for 1.5 h at 30 mV, blocked in TBS/5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:1000 dilution of goat-anti-rabbit phospho-p38 MAPK antibody or goat-anti-rabbit phospho-ERK 1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody (Cell Signaling) or mouse anti-arrestin3 (1:300, sc-13140, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following overnight incubation, membranes were washed 4 × 15 min in TBST (Tris-buffered saline, 1% Tween 20) and then incubated with the IRDye™ 800-conjugated affinity-purified anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:10,000 in a 1:1 mixture of 5% milk/TBS and Li-Cor blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed 4 × 15 min in TBST, 1 × 10 min in TBS to remove Tween 20 (which can cause high background fluorescence on the Odyssey imaging system) and analyzed as described below. Membranes were reprobed with rabbit anti-β-actin (3 h at room temperature, 5% milk/TBS) and secondary antibody (as above) to confirm equal protein loading. Data Analysis—Immunoblots were scanned using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences). Band intensity was measured using the Odyssey software, which subtracts background and calculates band density in pixels. Data were normalized to a percentage of control sample band intensity (basal, 100%) and plotted using GraphPad (GraphPad Prism 4.0) software. Concentration-response data were fit using non-linear regression (Prism 4.0). Statistical significance was taken as p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 as determined by the Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's post hoc test where appropriate. Kappa Agonist-induced Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK Is Dependent on KOR Phosphorylation and Arrestin Activation—Treatment of AtT-20 cells expressing KOR-GFP with the selective KOR agonist, 10 μm U50,488, for 15 min at 37 °C resulted in an increase in phospho-p38 MAPK and resulted in internalization of KOR-GFP receptors as shown by the punctate green fluorescence clustered in the cytosol (Fig. 1, A and B). The activation of p38 was blocked by pretreatment with the selective KOR antagonist 1 μm norbinaltorphimine (norBNI) (Fig. 1B, inset) and was not evident in untransfected AtT-20 cells (data not shown). AtT-20 cells expressing the mutant KOR, having a serine-to-alanine substitution at residue 369 (KSA-GFP), did not demonstrate an increase in phospho-p38 immunoreactivity and did not show KOR internalization after treatment with 10 μm U50,488 for 15 min at 37 °C (Fig. 1, C and D). The differences in response to agonist were not due to differences in receptor expression or receptor localization; KOR-GFP and KSA-GFP were expressed at equivalent levels as measured by [3H]diprenorphine saturation binding (see “Experimental Procedures”). These results are consistent with our previous report showing that KSA-GFP receptors can still activate G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (KIR3) currents in this cell type but do not show rapid desensitization (9Appleyard S.M.

Dominant Positive Arrestin3-R170E Rescues KSA-mediated p38 Activation—To assess whether KSA-GFP failed to induce p38 phosphorylation because agonist-bound KSA-GFP was unable to recruit arrestin and internalize as effectively as KOR-GFP (8McLaughlin J.P. Xu M. Mackie K. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34631-34640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Appleyard S.M. Celver J. Pineda V. Kovoor A. Wayman G.A. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23802-23807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we transfected the dominant positive arrestin3-(R170E)-YFP into KSA-GFP AtT-20 cells. This form of arrestin has been previously demonstrated to be constitutively active and can bind to the agonist-bound receptor independently of receptor phosphorylation (12Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 13Celver J. Vishnivetskiy S. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9043-9048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In KSA-GFP-expressing AtT-20 cells transfected with arrestin3-(R170E)-YFP and then stimulated with 10 μm U50,488, the KSA-GFP receptor was able to internalize and cause activation of p38 (Fig. 1F). Successful transfection of arrestin3-(R170E)-YFP was confirmed by increased cytosolic YFP labeling in KSA-GFP cells (10–15% of total cell population). Transfection of the pEYFP-C1 vector alone in KSA-GFP cells failed to induce a significant increase in phospho-p38 MAPK following U50,488 stimulation (data not shown). The effect of the arrestin3-(R170E)-YFP transfection on KSA-GFP mediated p38 activation was also quantified using immunoblotting. We found that transfection of the dominant positive arrestin3 resulted in an increase in KSA-GFP-mediated p38 activation following treatment with 10 μm U50,488 for 15 or 30 min (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, KOR-GFP cells transfected with arrestin3-(R170E)-YFP and stimulated with 10 μm U50,488 caused activation of p38 at an equal magnitude to the KOR-GFP cells without the dominant positive arrestin (data not shown), suggesting that the arrestin3-(R170E)-YFP transfection, by itself, does not increase p38 activation following agonist stimulation. These results suggest that serine 369 phosphorylation and the subsequent recruitment of arrestin were required for maximal KOR-GFP activation of p38. KOR-induced Phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 Was Independent of GRK/Arrestin—Stimulation of KOR-GFP with 10 μm U50,488 induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK maximally at 15 min (Fig. 3, A and C). Concentration-response curves for U50,488 and dynorphin-B for activating p38 at the 15-min time point were also generated. U50,488 and the KOR endogenous peptide agonist, dynorphin-B (prodynorphin 228–240), had similar potencies (EC50) for activation of p38 (200 ± 43 nm and 60 ± 24 nm, respectively, n = 3) in KOR-GFP cells (Fig. 5A). Activation of KSA-GFP by U50,488 was unable to cause significant phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 3, A–C). In contrast, equivalent U50,488-stimulated ERK 1/2 phosphorylation was evident for both the KOR-GFP and the KSA-GFP receptor-expressing AtT-20 cells (Fig. 3). These data suggest that KOR activates p38 and ERK 1/2 with different kinetics and via different signal transduction mechanisms.FIGURE 5KOR-mediated p38 activation in AtT-20 cells and Striatal Astrocytes is concentration-dependent.

It has been previously determined that mu and kappa opioid receptors are endogenously expressed by astrocytes and that these receptors can activate ERK 1/2 (4Belcheva M.M. Clark A.L. Haas P.D.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, KOR activation of p38 MAPK in primary striatal astrocytes has not been shown previously. U50,488 treatment caused an increase in the phospho-p38 staining in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells (Fig. 4D), suggesting that KOR activates p38 in astrocytes. The U50,488-induced increase in phospho-p38 labeling was blocked by 1 μm norBNI (data not shown). In addition, concentration-response curves for activation of p38 in wild-type astrocytes were determined for the KOR-selective agonists (17Chavkin C. Sud S. Jin W. Stewart J. Zjawiony J.K.

U50,488 and salvinorin A activated p38 with similar potency (U50,488 EC50 = 501 ± 348 nm; salvinorin A EC50 = 316 nm± 304 nm) and efficacy (2-fold over basal). In wild-type astrocytes, 10 μm U50,488 caused a 2-fold increase over basal in phospho-p38 (Fig. 6C) that was blocked by pretreatment with 1 μm norBNI (Fig. 6, A and C). In astrocyte cultures derived from striata of KOR–/– mice, 10 μm U50,488 had no significant effect on phospho-p38 levels (Fig. 6, A and C). The p38 activator anisomycin (50 μm, 15 min) caused a robust increase in phospho-p38 (650 ± 102%, n = 5) in KOR–/– cultures demonstrating that the p38 machinery is intact in these cells (Fig. 6A). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the U50,488-mediated increase in phospho-p38 in primary striatal astrocytes was KOR-dependent.FIGURE 6U50,488-stimulated p38-MAPK activation in primary striatal astrocytes and neurons is KOR-mediated and GRK3-dependent. A and B, wild type (W T), kappa opioid receptor knock-out (KOR–/–), and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase knock-out (GRK3–/–) primary striatal astrocytes were cultured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Astrocyte cultures were treated with vehicle (B), 10 μm U50,488 (U50),"
https://openalex.org/W2135519974,We simultaneously determined the physical structure and optical transition energies of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes by combining electron diffraction with Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy. These results test fundamental features of the excited electronic states of carbon nanotubes. We directly verified the systematic changes in transition energies of semiconducting nanotubes as a function of their chirality and observed predicted energy splittings of optical transitions in metallic nanotubes.
https://openalex.org/W1969222453,"The transcription factors Aft1 and Aft2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae regulate the expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis. These factors induce the expression of iron regulon genes in iron-deficient yeast but are inactivated in iron-replete cells. Iron inhibition of Aft1/Aft2 was previously shown to be dependent on mitochondrial components required for cytosolic iron sulfur protein biogenesis. We presently show that the nuclear monothiol glutaredoxins Grx3 and Grx4 are critical for iron inhibition of Aft1 in yeast cells. Cells lacking both glutaredoxins show constitutive expression of iron regulon genes. Overexpression of Grx4 attenuates wild type Aft1 activity. The thioredoxin-like domain in Grx3 and Grx4 is dispensable in mediating iron inhibition of Aft1 activity, whereas the conserved cysteine that is part of the conserved CGFS motif in monothiol glutaredoxins is essential for this function. Grx3 and Grx4 interact with Aft1 as shown by two-hybrid interactions and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The interaction between glutaredoxins and Aft1 is not modulated by the iron status of cells but is dependent on the conserved glutaredoxin domain Cys residue. Thus, Grx3 and Grx4 are novel components required for Aft1 iron regulation that most likely occurs in the nucleus.

Iron, an indispensable nutrient in cell physiology, is used in iron-sulfur clusters, hemes, and diiron-oxo metal centers in enzymes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a model organism in metal metabolism, maintains iron homeostasis largely through the regulation of iron uptake and storage. In this yeast, survival under low iron conditions is ensured through the utilization of the iron-responsive transcriptional activators Aft1 and Aft2 (1Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D.

These factors are activated in iron-deficient cells and induce the expression of more than 20 genes that are referred to as the iron regulon (4Foury F. Talibi D. J. Biol.

This regulon includes genes whose products function in ionic iron acquisition, iron siderophore uptake, and vacuolar iron utilization. Activated Aft1 also induces the expression of CTH2 that encodes an RNA-binding protein. Cth2 mediates the degradation of transcripts of some iron-requiring enzymes to conserve iron in the cell (8Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Aft1 is localized to the nucleus under low iron conditions and to cytoplasm under iron-sufficient conditions (9Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Under iron-sufficient conditions, Aft1 remains inactive due to its cytoplasmic localization where it is unable to drive transcription (9Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Aft1 has two nuclear localization sequences and a nuclear export sequence (NES), 2The abbreviations used are: NES, nuclear export sequence; CM, complete synthetic medium; TAP, tandem affinity purification; CIA, cytosolic Fe-S, protein assembly; BPS, bathophenanthroline sulfonate. 2The abbreviations used are: NES, nuclear export sequence; CM, complete synthetic medium; TAP, tandem affinity purification; CIA, cytosolic Fe-S, protein assembly; BPS, bathophenanthroline sulfonate. which map to its N-terminal DNA binding domain (9Yamaguchi-Iwai Y.

Mutations of two leucines within the NES result in retention of Aft1 within the nucleus and constitutive transcriptional activity regardless of iron levels. In addition, Aft1 contains a functionally important conserved 291CXC293 sequence motif adjacent to the DNA binding domain and 190 residues down-stream of the NES. Cys to Phe substitutions at either Cys within this motif in Aft1 result in constitutive transcriptional activation in iron-replete cells (9Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 11Rutherford J.C. Ojeda L. Balk J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10135-10140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). As expected, the constitutively active C291F Aft1 variant (Aft1-1up) is retained within the nucleus. Thus, iron-regulation of Aft1 is dependent on its cycling between the nuclear and the cytoplasmic compartments. The mechanism by which Aft1 and Aft2 sense cellular iron levels has been a topic of interest and intense research. Clues on the mechanism of iron sensing came from the observation that cells defective for Fe-S cluster biogenesis within the mitochondrial matrix exhibited constitutive expression of the iron regulon (12Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12321-12326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Since disruption of Fe-S cluster biogenesis results in mitochondrial iron accumulation, it was initially thought that Aft1 was constitutive by virtue of depletion of cytosolic iron (12Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12321-12326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It was later shown that disruption of Fe-S cluster biogenesis by diminution in the levels of the cysteine desulfurase (Nfs1) or the frataxin homologue (Yfh1) did not decrease cytosolic iron (13Chen O.S. Crisp R.J. Valachovic M. Bard M. Winge D.R. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29513-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This is an indication that Aft1 becomes constitutive due to impairment of a signal created by the mitochondrial Fe-S biosynthetic machinery and not to an indirect effect of alteration in iron compartmentalization. In S. cerevisiae mitochondria are required for maturation of Fe-S proteins both inside and outside of the organelle (14Lill R. Muhlenhoff U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). For synthesis of cytosolic and nuclear Fe-S proteins, mitochondria export a still unknown compound via the mitochondrial inner membrane transporter Atm1 (15Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Other components of this export machinery are the mitochondrial intermembrane space sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1 as well as glutathione (15Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 16Lange H. Lisowsky T. Gerber J. Muhlenhoff U. Kispal G. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Depletion of glutathione activates Aft1 (11Rutherford J.C. Ojeda L. Balk J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10135-10140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 17Sipos K. Lange H. Fekete Z. Ullmann P. Lill R. Kispal G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26944-26949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). After export to the cytosol, the cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly machinery (CIA) matures Fe-S clusters and inserts them into target proteins (14Lill R. Muhlenhoff U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The CIA machinery includes the proteins Nar1, Cfd1, Nbp35, and Cia1 (18Roy A. Solodovnikova N. Nicholson T. Antholine W. Walden W.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4826-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Balk J. Pierik A.J. Netz D.J.A. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R.

Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 10833-10841Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Iron sensing by Aft1 and Aft2 requires proper mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biosynthesis as well as a functional export to the cytoplasm. However, it does not require the CIA machinery (11Rutherford J.C. Ojeda L. Balk J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10135-10140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), demonstrating that iron sensing by Aft1/Aft2 is not linked to the maturation of cytosolic 4Fe-4S clusters. Since the CIA complex is not required to mediate iron inhibition of Aft1 function, we predicted that other proteins may be involved in sensing the iron inhibitory signal extruded by Atm1. One attractive candidate protein was the nuclear glutaredoxin-3 (Grx3), which was reported to interact with Aft1 in a global yeast two-hybrid interaction study (21Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. QureshiEmili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M.J. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3901) Google Scholar). Glutaredoxins are glutathione-dependent thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases that function in maintaining the cellular redox homeostasis. S. cerevisiae has two dithiol glutaredoxins (Grx1 and Grx2) and three monothiol glutaredoxins (Grx3, Grx4, and Grx5) (22Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabbiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 23Molina M.M. Belli G. de la Torre M.A. Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Herrero E. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The monothiol glutaredoxins are believed to reduce mixed disulfides formed between a protein and glutathione in a process known as deglutathionylation. In contrast, dithiol glutaredoxins can participate in deglutathionylation as well as in the direct reduction of disulfides (25Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Antiooxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Grx5, the most studied monothiol glutaredoxin, is localized to the mitochondrial matrix, where it participates in the maturation of Fe-S clusters (24Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Belli G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Grx3 and Grx4 are predominantly localized to the nucleus (26Belli G. Polaina J. Tamarit J. de la Torre M.A. Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37590-37596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These proteins can substitute for Grx5 when overexpressed and targeted to the mitochondrial matrix (23Molina M.M. Belli G. de la Torre M.A. Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51923-51930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); no information on their natural function has been reported. In addition to the reported interaction between Grx3 and Aft1, iron inhibition of Aft1 requires glutathione (11Rutherford J.C. Ojeda L. Balk J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10135-10140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Based on these clues, we evaluated the role of Grx3 and Grx4 in the iron inhibition of Aft1 and show presently that iron sensing is dependent on the presence of the redundant Grx3 and Grx4 proteins. Yeast Strains and Culture Conditions—The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. BY4742, Δgrx3, Δgrx4, and Δglr1 strains were obtained from Research Genetics. A PCR-created LEU2 cassette was integrated by homologous recombination at the GRX3 locus in a Δgrx4 cell to create the Δgrx3Δgrx4 strain. The Δtrr1 and YM4271 strains were previously described (27Garrido E.O. Grant C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A PCR-created HIS3 cassette was integrated by homologous recombination at the AFT1 locus in a YM4271 strain to create the Δaft1 strain used in yeast two-hybrid experiments. Cells were grown at 30 °C either in YPD medium, containing yeast extract, tryptone, and dextrose, or in complete synthetic medium (CM) or incomplete synthetic medium lacking, for example, uracil (CM–Ura) or leucine (CM–Leu). For several experiments, the growth medium was supplemented with 0.1 mm bathophenanthroline sulfonate (BPS) as a ferrous iron chelator to lower the availability of iron or supplemented with 0.1 mm FeCl2. Doxycycline was added to the medium at a 5 μg/ml final concentration for the indicated periods of time to modulate expression from the tetO7 promoter (28Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). All cells were harvested during log phase.TABLE 1Strains used in the present studyStrainDescriptionWild typeBY4742 Matα, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0Δgrx3BY4742 Matα, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0, grx3::KanMXΔgrx4BY4742 Matα, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0, grx4::KanMXΔgrx3,Δgrx4BY4742 Matα, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0, grx3::LEU2 grx4::KanMXΔglr1BY4742 Matα, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0, glr1::KanMXΔaft1BY4742 Matα, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0, aft1::KanMXWild typeCY4 Mat a ura3-52, leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ade2-1, his3-11 can1-100Δtrr1CY4 Mat a ura3-52, leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ade2-1, his3-11 can1-100 trr1::HIS3YM4271Mata, ura3-52, his3-Δ200, ade2-101, lys2-801, leu2-3,112, trp1-901 tyr1-501 gal4-Δ512 gal80-Δ538, ade5::hisGΔaft1(YM4271)Mata, ura3-52, his3-Δ200, ade2-101, lys2-801, leu2-3,112, trp1-901 tyr1-501 gal4-Δ512 gal80-Δ538, ade5::hisG, aft1::HIS3 Open table in a new tab Plasmids—All plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Full-length wild type GRX3 and GRX4 coding sequences as well as their mutant forms (GRX3 C211S and GRX4 C171S) were tagged at the 3′-end with one Myc epitope. In addition, full-length wild type GRX4 as well as its mutant forms (GRX4 C171S and GRX4 GPm) were also tagged at the 3′-end with His6 epitopes. All of these constructs were cloned in the YCp pCM189 and YEp pCM190 plasmids under the control of the doxycycline-regulated tetO7 promoter (28Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In the previous cloning procedures, GRX3 constructs were cloned between NotI/PstI sites, and GRX4 constructs were cloned at BamHI/PstI sites. For the two-hybrid experiments, the plasmid pBG4D-1, which contains the ADH1 promoter and the GAL4 (codons 1–147) DNA binding domain, was used. The GRX3 and GRX4 coding sequences were amplified and ligated into pBG4D-1, resulting in GRX3 and GRX4 3′-ends being fused in frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The VP16 activation domain fused to the CYC1 terminator (5′ to 3′ orientation) was amplified and ligated into pRS416. The AFT1 promoter and open reading frame was PCR-amplified with SpeI/BglII sites and ligated into cut pRS416 VP16-CYC1 plasmid, resulting in AFT1 being fused in frame with VP16. The resulting AFT1 VP16 was used as a template for PCR mutagenesis of C291F and C293F. The previous AFT1 constructs are under the control of the AFT1 promoter. AFT1 was TAP-tagged at its C terminus by homologous recombination in its chromosomal locus (29Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). The genomic AFT1-TAP was later used as a template in a PCR where AFT1-TAP was amplified, cut, and ligated into pCM190, where it is under the control of the tetO7 promoter. Wild type AFT1, AFT1-1up, and AFT1 L99A were subcloned in plasmid pRS416 under the control of its own promoter. The C-terminal 375 bp of GRX4 (including the glutaredoxin domain but excluding the thioredoxin domain) as well as the C-terminal 381 bp of GRX5 (excluding the mitochondrial target sequence) was PCR-amplified and ligated into pCM190, where they were under the control of the tetO7 promoter. S1 Nuclease Assays—RNA was extracted from cells grown to midlog phase using the hot acid phenol method, and S1 analysis was performed as previously described (30Dohrmann P.R. Butler G. Tamai K. Dorland S. Greene J.R. Thiele D.J. Stillman D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For each reaction, 12 μg of total RNA were hybridized to a 32P end-labeled DNA oligonucleotide probe before digestion with S1 nuclease and separation on an 8% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea polyacrylamide gel. Dried gels were imaged using a Bio-Rad FX phosphor imager and quantified using Quantity One software prior to autoradiography. DNA Microarray Analysis—RNA was extracted from wild type BY4742 and Δgrx3Δgrx4 cells grown in YPD medium supplemented with 200 μm FeCl2. Total RNA was isolated using the hot acid phenol method. mRNA was isolated from total RNA by using the Poly(A) Tract mRNA isolation system IV kit from Promega following the manufacturer's instructions. Fabrication of DNA microarray, synthesis of fluorescence-labeled cDNA, hybridization of the microarrays, and subsequent scanning were performed in the Huntsman Cancer Institute Microarray Core Facility at the University of Utah. β-Galactosidase Assays—Cells were grown to midexponential phase (A600 0.5) in CM–Ura–Leu–His–Trp, 2% glucose either with supplemented iron or in the presence of BPS. β-Galactosidase activity was measured in permeabilized cells as previously described (31Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar) and is expressed in Miller units that are calculated as follows (Δ420 × 1000)/(min × ml of culture used × absorbance of the culture at 600 nm). Immunoprecipitation and Immunodetection—Cellular lysates for immunoprecipitation analysis were prepared by glass beading in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, and a protease inhibitor mixture. The supernatant was incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The protein A-agarose was collected by centrifugation, washed three times, and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated protein was resolved by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked and probed with either PAP peroxidase anti-peroxidase (for TAP detection) or rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc. Detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence after incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. In addition, an aliquot of the supernatant was used for immunodetection analysis by immunoblotting, using PAP (Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-Pgk1 (Molecular Probes), and mouse monoclonal anti-His (Novagen). Cellular lysates were prepared for immunoblotting by glass beading using 10% trichloroacetic acid in Tris acetate buffer, pH 8. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were probed with antibodies previously described and detected using chemiluminescence (ECL; Pierce). Labeling of yeast cells with radioactive iron (55Fe) and the determination of iron incorporation into Fe-S proteins by immunoprecipitation and liquid scintillation counting were carried out as previously described (15Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Miscellaneous Procedures—The following published methods were used. The sulfite reductase assay was performed as previously described (11Rutherford J.C. Ojeda L. Balk J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10135-10140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). For aconitase activity assays, cells were lysed by bead beating, and aconitase activity was determined by coupled reaction of aconitase (EC 4.2.1.3) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42) (32Rose I.A. O'Connell E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1870-1879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed by either PCR mutagenesis or by introducing the mutation in the primer followed by homologous recombination (33Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was performed using standard lithium acetate protocol (34Becker D.M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of Grx3 and Grx4 in the iron inhibition of Aft1, we quantified the expression of two iron regulon genes, FET3 and FIT3, in cells lacking either Grx3 or Grx4 or in cells lacking both molecules (Fig. 1, A and B). Gene expression was assessed by quantifying mRNA levels using the S1 nuclease protection assay. Whereas expression of FET3 and FIT3 was inhibited in iron-supplemented wild type cells, expression of FET3, but not FIT3, was elevated 3.5- and 2.5-fold in iron-supplemented Δgrx3 or Δgrx4 cells, respectively, relative to wild type cells. The absence of Grx3 or Grx4 did not affect the full induction of FET3 observed when the iron bioavailability is limited in cells treated with the iron chelator bathophenanthroline sulfonate (BPS). Cells lacking both Grx3 and Grx4 exhibited constitutive expression of both FET3 and FIT3. To verify that the major iron regulon genes were expressed in Δgrx3Δgrx4 cells, DNA microarray analysis was performed comparing wild type and Δgrx3Δgrx4 cells cultured in YPD medium supplemented with iron (Table 2). The same genes induced by the constitutively active Aft1-1up were highly expressed in Δgrx3 Δgrx4 cells, although the observed induction ratios varied. Such variation in the induction ratios of iron regulon genes is observed under other conditions that activate Aft1 (4Foury F. Talibi D. J. Biol.

These data confirm that the iron regulon is induced in the absence of Grx3 and Grx4. The induced expression of iron regulon genes observed in Δgrx3Δgrx4 cells cultured in iron-replete medium was due to the absence of Grx3 and Grx4, since transformation of the double null cells with GRX4 under the TET promoter restored inhibition of FET3 expression (Fig. 2). As expected, the addition of doxycycline to repress GRX4 expression yielded elevated FET3 expression.TABLE 2Genes induced in Δgrx3Δgrx4 cells compared with Aft1-1up-containing cellsGeneΔgrx3Δgrx4 versus WT (mean n = 2)Aft1-1up versus WT (mean n = 3)-fold inductionFIT1389FIT31943FIT21230CTH2115FET3825SIT187ENB15.57ISU24.71.3CAD14.31.7ARN14.12.5MRS43.81.7COT13.72.2 Open table in a new tab Grx3 and Grx4 appear to be redundant molecules. Δgrx4 cells transformed with a low copy plasmid containing either GRX3 or GRX4 restored full iron inhibition of FET3 transcription (Fig. 3A). Grx3 and Grx4 are members of the monothiol glutaredoxin family and as such possess a single functional cysteinyl residue within a CGFS sequence motif (36Fladvad M. Bellanda M. Fernandes A.P. Mammi S. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. Sunnerhagen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24553-24561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We tested whether the single conserved cysteine residue within the CGFS motif in each protein is essential for iron inhibition of Aft1 activity. Transformation of Δgrx4 cells with a YCp plasmid-borne GRX4 restored iron inhibition of FET3 expression, whereas transformants containing a mutant GRX4 allele encoding a C171S substitution failed to inhibit FET3 expression (Fig. 3A). In the same way, mutant Grx3 containing a C211S substitution failed to mediate iron inhibition of FET3 expression in Δgrx3 cells (Fig. 3B). Although the mutant Grx3 and Grx4 proteins were inactive, they were stably expressed (data not shown). Thus, the putative functional cysteinyl residue in each glutaredoxin is important to mediate iron inhibition of Aft1. Since depletion of Grx3 and Grx4 resulted in constitutive Aft1 activity, the effect of overexpression of GRX4 on Aft1 function in wild type cells was evaluated. Wild type cells cultured in iron-limited SC medium showed partial FET3 expression that could be completely inhibited by the addition of iron salts to the culture medium. The overexpression of GRX4 in cells cultured in this iron-limited medium markedly attenuated FET3 expression (Fig. 4, A and B, two lanes on the left). The inhibitory effect of GRX4 overexpression was also seen when Aft1 was fully activated in BPS-supplemented, iron-deficient cells (data not shown). In addition, the C171S substitution in Grx4 partially abrogated the ability of overexpressed Grx4 to attenuate FET3 expression in wild type cells (Fig. 4A). Aft1 becomes constitutively active when the 291CXC293 motif or the NES motif is mutated (1Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 9Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To address whether overexpression of Grx4 can attenuate the function of constitutively active variants of Aft1, the TET-GRX4-containing high copy vector was transformed into Δaft1 cells containing either an AFT1 allele encoding the C291F variant (Aft1-1up) or the L99A NES variant. Overexpression of Grx4 inhibited wild type Aft1 activity and resulted in a partial, reproducible attenuation of Aft1 (L99A) (Fig. 4, C and D) but no significant attenuation of the activity of the Aft1-1up constitutive mutant (Fig. 4E). Monothiol glutaredoxins are believed to function in the deglutathionylation of target proteins (37Fernandes A.P. Fladvad M. Bernd C. Andersen C. Lillig C.H. Neubauer P. Sunnerhagen M. Holmgren A.

Such low compressional and shear wave velocities and high Poisson's ratio are also observed experimentally in post-perovskite silicate phase containing up to 40 mol% FeSiO 3 endmember. The iron-rich post-perovskite silicate is stable at the pressure-temperature and chemical environment of the core-mantle boundary and can be formed by core-mantle reaction. Mantle dynamics may lead to further accumulation of this material into the ultralow-velocity patches that are observable by seismology.

Retrocyclin-1 (4 μm) completely blocked fusion mediated by HIV-1 Envs that used CXCR4 or CCR5 but had little effect on cell fusion mediated by HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus Envs. Retrocyclin-1 inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion without impairing the lateral mobility of CD4, and it inhibited the fusion of CD4-deficient cells with cells bearing CD4-independent HIV-1 Env. Thus, it could act without cross-linking membrane proteins or inhibiting gp120-CD4 interactions. Retrocyclin-1 acted late in the HIV-1 Env fusion cascade but prior to 6-helix bundle formation. Surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that retrocyclin bound the ectodomain of gp41 with high affinity in a glycan-independent manner and that it bound selectively to the gp41 C-terminal heptad repeat.

Under certain conditions, this allows retrocyclins to prevent viral entry by cross-linking cell surface molecules, as recently shown for influenza A (11Leikina E. Delanoe-Ayari H. Melikov K. Cho M.S.

Despite its activity against HIV-1, retrocyclin-1 is considerably less effective against HIV-2 or SIV. Because the cross-linked barrier mechanism would not explain such selectivity, we examined the inhibitory effects of retrocyclin-1 on fusion mediated by HIV-1 Env. We found that retrocyclin-1 prevents HIV-1 entry by binding the C-heptad repeat of gp41 in a lectin-independent manner that prevents 6HB formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell-Cell Fusion Assay—Dye transfer assays, which involve observing the transfer of fluorescent cytosolic dyes from the target cell type to a non-labeled envelope expressing cell type, were used to quantify the amount on envelope-induced cell-cell fusion. HIV/SIV Env-expressing HeLa cells labeled with CMTMR and target cells labeled with calcein were co-cultured in suspension at 37 °C. Inhibitors were added at the onset of incubation or at various times thereafter. Phase and fluorescent images were collected with a 10× objective lens (30Munoz-Barroso I. Durell S. Sakaguchi K.

Samples, diluted in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, were placed in a 0.1 cm path length CD cell (Hellma, Plainview, NY). The spectra were averaged from four scans, smoothed, and expressed as the mean residue ellipticity [θ]MRE. Additional information about cells, recombinants, and methods is provided in supplemental “Methods and Materials,” on-line.Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)—FRAP was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) confocal laser scanning microscope. HeLa cells were plated on 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and transfected 24 h prior to confocal analysis with CD4-GFP. These constructs were generous gifts from W. Popik, and have been described previously (37Popik W. Alce T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 704-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). During FRAP analysis cells were kept at physiological conditions of 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a stage-incubation system (“Incubator S,” PeCon GmbH, Erbach, Germany). Retrocyclin was added directly into the medium and incubated for 10 min before commencing FRAP measurements. A 488 nm Ar+ laser line was used for GFP excitation and emission light was collected with a 500-550 bandpass filter. A 40×/1.3 NA oil immersion objective lens was used with a zoom factor of 4. The detector pinhole was opened slightly to acquire an optical section of 2 μm thickness, allowing more light to be collected for better quantification. Three prebleach images were acquired to determine the rate of non-purposeful photobleaching. Photobleaching was performed by increasing the transmission of the laser to 100% for 20-50 iterations to get as complete a bleach as possible without overbleaching. After photobleaching, 8-10 images were acquired at 1-s intervals. Then the time resolution was changed to 10 s to follow recovery to completion. A total of 20-40 data points was acquired for image analysis.FRAP analysis was performed using the Medical Imaging Processing, Analysis, and Visualization (MIPAV; CIT/NIH, Bethesda, MD) software package. Data were automatically corrected with background subtraction, and normalization for the non-purposeful photobleaching rate was calculated from the whole cell. Data were analyzed using the one-dimensional FRAP model.RESULTSInhibition of Fusion—Retrocyclin-1 inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1a), with an IC50 of ∼1.5 μm, and complete inhibition at ∼4 μm. Retrocyclin-1 inhibited fusion mediated by HIV-1IIIB (X4) and HIV-1BAL (R5) Env but not HIV-2ROD Env (Fig. 1b). Fusion mediated by HIV-2SBL and SIVMAC Env was slightly inhibited by retrocyclin-1. For comparison, Fig. 1 also shows inhibition of HIV/SIV Env-mediated fusion by cyanovirin-N (CV-N), an 11-kDa mannose-binding protein isolated from a Cyanobacterium, Nostoc ellipsosporum, which potently inactivates diverse strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV (38Boyd M.R.

Immunol. 2003; 170: 4708-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), its inhibition of HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion might reflect interactions with these membrane components. We examined the fusion of CD4-independent 8x Env (39Hoffman T.L. LaBranche C.C. Zhang W. Canziani G. Robinson J. Chaiken I. Hoxie J.A. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6359-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) with mouse fibroblast 3T3 target cells bearing CD4 and CXCR4, or bearing CXCR4 alone. Retrocyclin-1 blocked 8x Env-mediated fusion with CXCR4+ cells with or without CD4, indicating that its effects were independent of gp120-CD4 interactions (Fig. 1c). The ∼30% residual fusion of 3T3CD4CXCR4 and 3T3CXCR4 in the presence of retrocyclin is likely because of nonspecific background dye transfer, because cyanovirin-N, which completely blocks HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion with various cell types, showed the same background. Because retrocyclin-1 also inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion with glycosphingolipid-deficient mouse skin fibroblasts (GM95 cells) that expressed CD4 and CXCR4 (40Rawat S.S. Eaton J. Gallo S.A.

Virology. 2004; 318: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), interactions with glycosphingolipids were not essential for its inhibitory effects on HIV-1 (Fig. 1c).Excluding Membrane Cross-linking—A recently described mechanism (11Leikina E.

In those studies, retrocyclin inhibited viral fusion by erecting a barricade of cross-linked and immobilized surface glycoproteins. When FRAP experiments were performed to assess the effect of retrocyclin-1 on the lateral mobility of CD4 in medium that contained 10% fetal calf serum, we found the lateral mobility of CD4 to be intact (Table 1) and concluded that cross-linked surface barricades on the target membrane did not form under the experimental conditions used in our fusion experiments.TABLE 1Effect of retrocyclin-1 on the lateral mobility of CD4 HeLa cells were transfected with CD4-GFP 1 day before measuring FRAP.

All reactions were run for 120 min, from the initial co-culture to fusion quantification.Time-of-addition studies were done with Leu3A, retrocyclin-1, and C34 to assess the availability of the target of retrocyclin during the fusion process (31Gallo S.A. Puri A. Blumenthal R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12231-12236Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Leu3A inhibits attachment of gp120 to CD4, and C34, a 34-residue peptide whose sequence matches the C-HR of gp41 (supplemental Fig. 1) prevents 6HB formation. Previously we had shown that C34 operates after Leu3A (31Gallo S.A. Puri A. Blumenthal R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12231-12236Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Fig. 2a shows that at 30 min, by which time 50% of the HIV-1 Envs had interacted with CD4, fusion remained 100% inhibitable by retrocyclin-1 and C34. Thereafter, retrocyclin-1 and C34 had identical inhibition kinetics, indicating that the target of retrocyclin disappeared late, in a time frame similar to that of 6HB formation.FIGURE 2Retrocyclin-1 inhibits HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion in a late stage of the fusion cascade. a, time of Addition. Inhibitors Leu3a (3 μg/ml), RC-1 (4 μm), and C34 (2 μm) were added at different times after the initial co-culture of HIV-1 Env-expressing CV-1 cells with SupT1 target cells and the fusion was monitored using a dye redistribution assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” b, soluble CD4-primed cells. Fusion of HIV-1 Env-expressing CV-1 cells (E) with SupT1 target cells (T) was monitored using a dye redistribution assay after pretreatment of targets or effectors. The following conditions were examined: no treatment (E0, T0); co-culture in the presence of inhibitor (E+, T+); pretreatment with inhibitor of effectors, followed by washing and co-culture with untreated targets (E+W & T0); pretreatment with inhibitor of targets followed by washing and co-culture with untreated effectors (T+W/E0); incubation of effectors for one h at 37 °C with sCD4 (40 μg/ml) followed by washing and incubation with targets (sCD4 E0 T0); incubation of effectors for one h at 37 °C with sCD4 + inhibitor, followed by washing and incubation with targets (sCD4 E+ T+). The inhibitors were retrocyclin-1 (4 μm) (black bars), sCD4 and C34 (2 μm) (gray bars).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Priming—Binding HIV-1 Env to CD4 and either CXCR4 or CCR5 triggers conformational changes that lead to viral hairpin (6HB) formation and membrane fusion (27Gallo S.A.

Cell. 2003; 14: 926-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Throughout the period of accessibility, HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion can be inhibited by peptides derived from the N-HR or C-HR regions of gp41 (31Gallo S.A. Puri A. Blumenthal R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12231-12236Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 41Melikyan G.B. Markosyan R.M. Hemmati H. Delmedico M.K. Lambert D.M. Cohen F.S. J.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8230-8233Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).As the time-of-addition studies (Fig. 2a) had implicated N- or C-HR as targets for retrocyclin, we primed HIV-1 Env-expressing cells with 1 μg/ml of soluble CD4 (sCD4) and either retrocyclin-1 or C34 for 1 h at 37 °C before washing and then co-culturing them with target cells. Exposure to this suboptimal sCD4 concentration caused no inhibition, alone or in combination with C34 or retrocyclin-1 (Fig. 2b). However, incubating sCD4-primed cells with retrocyclin-1 or C34 inhibited fusion, lending support to the hypothesis that retrocyclin targets the N-HR and/or C-HR. Fig. 2b also shows that incubating either effectors or targets with RC-1 followed by washing resulted in no fusion inhibition, indicating that the RC-1 binding to targets and unprimed effectors is reversible.Binding of Retrocyclin-1 to gp41—Fig. 3 compares binding of retrocyclin-1 to gp41HXB2, gp120LAV, and bovine serum albumin (BSA). Per unit of mass, gp41 and gp120 bound retrocyclin-1 to an equal extent. However, as the mass of gp120 is ∼8 times larger than that of the gp41 ectodomain (∼16.4 kDa, exclusive of glycans), 8 times more retrocyclin-1 molecules bound a molecule of gp120 than a molecule of gp41. supplemental Table 1 shows four experiments comparing binding of retrocyclin-1 to gp120 and gp41. The Kd of retrocyclin-1 (mean ± S.E., n = 4) for gp41HXB2 was 67.6 ± 9.1 nm, and the Kd for gp120LAV was 33.0 ± 4.7 nm. These differences were significant (p = 0.021, paired t test).FIGURE 3Binding of retrocyclin-1. Binding to gp41HXB2 ectodomain, gp120LAV, and BSA was studied by surface plasmon resonance. Each data point is the mean of values from two separate complete dose-response curves. The biosensor chip contained the following amounts of attached protein: gp41, 2221 relative units (RU); gp120, 5746 RU; BSA, 5605 RU. Each data set has been normalized to show binding to 5000 RU of immobilized protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because retrocyclin-1 has lectin-like properties (29Wang W. Cole A.M. Hong T. Waring A.J. Lehrer R.I. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4708-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and the ectodomain of gp41HXB2 contains N-linked glycosylation sites, we did the experiments shown in supplemental Table 2 to learn whether retrocyclin-1 bound gp41 via its N-linked glycans. By using lectins, we determined that only high mannose glycans were present in the immobilized gp41 ectodomain. Removing these glycans with endoglycosidase H did not decrease the binding of retrocyclin to gp41, showing that the binding of retrocyclin-1 to gp41 was not carbohydrate-related.We next used a library of synthetic peptide fragments of HIV-1MN gp41 to determine where retrocyclin-1 might bind the gp41 ectodomain. Two C-terminal peptides, gp41(633-650) (EREIDNYTSLIYSLLEKS) and gp41(675-685) (DITNWLWYIK) showed the greatest binding, and gp41(651-674) bound retrocyclin-1 to a lesser extent (supplemental Table 3). We ran these surface plasmon resonance binding experiments in a competitive mode, using three different biosensors: BSA, gp120LAV, and gp41HXB2. Fig. 3 shows that binding of retrocyclin-1 to immobilized BSA is highly linear with peptide concentration, and its binding to the gp120 and gp41 biosensors is reasonably linear. Consequently, any of these biosensors can be used to assess the concentration of free (unbound) retrocyclin-1 in the presence of a potential binder, as long as the potential binder does not itself bind significantly to the biosensor. Indeed, with only one exception, biosensors containing BSA, gp120LAV, or gp41HXB2 gave similar results (supplemental Table 3).Fig. 4a shows that retrocyclin-1 bound the C34 domain of HIV-1 with greater affinity than the C34 domains of HIV-2 or SIV. Fig. 4b shows that BSA and gp120 biosensors detected binding between retrocyclin-1 and gp41(633-650) equally well, with an estimated IC50 of ∼15 μg/ml (7 μm). Fig. 4c shows that retrocyclin bound more extensively to gp41 (HIV-1HXB2) than to gp36 (HIV-2, Biodesign R5B220). Both recombinant Env glycoproteins had been expressed in yeast, Pichia pastoris. The net anionicity of a gp41 peptide did not fully account for its ability to bind retrocyclin-1, because gp41(651-674) (net charge, -3) bound less well than either gp41(633-650) or gp41(675-684), with respective net charges of -2 and 0. Nor was the net positive charge of retrocyclin-1 sufficient, because retrocyclin-1 that had been reduced and then alkylated with iodoacetamide no longer bound gp41, despite its undiminished net charge of +4 (data not shown). Thus, topological factors involving the placement and accessibility of the charged residues in gp41 and retrocyclin-1 could play key roles in binding.FIGURE 4Binding of retrocyclin-1 to C34 peptides. a, retrocyclin-1 (1 μg/ml) was mixed with various concentrations of C34 peptides from HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV. This biosensor chip contained 5545 RU of immobilized BSA, and showed negligible binding of C34. b, biosensor chips on which either BSA or gp120 had been immobilized gave very similar results, here illustrated by gp41(633-650) from HIV-1. In a and b, binding (percent of control) is expressed relative to binding by retrocyclin-1 in the absence of C34 peptide. The concentrations of the C34 peptides were established by quantitative amino acid analyses. c, binding of retrocyclin-1 to recombinant gp41 from HIV-1 greatly exceeded its binding to immobilized gp36 from HIV-2. Both recombinant glycoproteins were expressed in a yeast, P. pastoris, and were immobilized to a similar density (∼2000 RU) on the biosensor chips.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The gp41 ectodomains from HIV-1 strains MN, HXB2, and IIIB are shown in supplemental Fig. 1. The HXB2 strain used in our surface plasmon resonance experiments and the IIIB strain used in the cell fusion experiments have identical sequences that are similar to the MN sequence used for the gp41 peptide library. gp41(633-650), the peptide with the greatest binding to retrocyclin-1, comprises about half of the C34 sequence.Retrocyclin-1 Inhibits gp41 6HB Formation—Because retrocyclin-1 bound the C-peptides derived from the HIV-1 gp41 C-HR region, we considered that it might also block C-peptide/N-peptide interactions that form the 6HB of gp41.

Additionally, recent evidence suggests that ROS are physiological regulators and mediators of cell signaling due to cytokines and growth factors (13Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Trends Biochem.

Under physiological conditions, the biological effects of ROS are tightly regulated by chemical and enzymatic antioxidant defenses. However, when these defenses are overwhelmed by disease or injury, ROS attack many cell constituents, with unsaturated lipids being the main target. Unsaturated lipids provide a readily extractable proton to oxygen-free radicals. The resultant lipid radical is stabilized by the bis-allylic double bond system and rapidly accepts molecular oxygen to form peroxyl radicals. This initiates a series of complex, autocatalytic reactions that generate a variety of carbonyl compounds as their end products (17Porter N.A. Caldwell S.E. Mills K.A. Lipids. 1995; 30: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Of these, aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE) are the most abundant and hence of greater biological significance (18Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that lipid aldehydes such as malonaldehyde can also be formed by free radical attack to deoxyribose (19Zhou X. Taghizadeh K. Dedon P. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which HNE affects cell growth remain obscure. Our previous studies show that VSMC transform HNE into multiple metabolites (37Ruef J. Liu S.Q. Bode C. Tocchi M.

These include direct oxidation and reduction of HNE to 4-hydroxynonanoic acid and 1,4-dihydroxynonene (DHN), respectively. In addition, HNE also undergoes glutathione S-transferase (GST)-catalyzed conjugation to form GS-HNE, which is further reduced to GS-DHN by aldose reductase (AR; AKR1B4) (39Dixit B.L. Balendiran G.K.

However, the functional significance of this metabolism is unclear and it is not known whether the mitogenic effects are directly due to HNE or mediated by one of its metabolites. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that GS-DHN, the product of AR-catalyzed reduction of the glutathione conjugate of HNE, is the active metabolite that mediates HNE signaling and mitogenesis. This view is consistent with our previous observations that inhibition of AR (AKR1B4) prevents protein kinase C activation and NF-κB activation (43Ramana K. Chandra D. Srivastava S. Bhatnagar A.

Our current results demonstrate the selective ability of GS-DHN in mediating HNE-induced VSMC growth and support the view that AR-catalyzed reduction of glutathione conjugates in general may be a critical and essential interface between detoxification and signaling. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), phosphate-buffered saline, penicillin/streptomycin solution, trypsin, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Invitrogen. Consensus oligonucleotide for NF-κB (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) and AP-1 (5′-TTCCGGCTGACTCATCAAGCG-3′) transcription factors were obtained from Promega Corp. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), glutathione monoethyl ester, and polyclonal antibodies against MRP-2 were obtained from Sigma. All other reagents used were of analytical grade. Cell Culture—Rat VSMC were isolated from healthy rat aorta and characterized by smooth muscle cell-specific α-actin expression. VSMC were maintained and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Preparation of Cell Permeable GS-aldehyde Esters—HNE was synthesized as described previously (41Srivastava S. Chandra A. Wang L.F. Seifert Jr., W.E. DaGue B.B. Ansari Srivastava N.H. Bhatnagar S. K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10893-10900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled [4-3H]HNE was synthesized from the dimethylacetal of HNE, which was oxidized to the 4-keto derivative using polymer-supported chromic acid as an oxidizing agent. The resulting ketone was further reduced to the dimethylacetal of HNE by using tritiated NaBH4. The [4-3H]HNE obtained by acid hydrolysis was purified on HPLC and stored in methyline chloride at –20 °C until further use. The conjugate of glutathione-reduced ethyl ester with HNE (GS-HNE-ester) was prepared by incubating 1 μmol of [4-3H]HNE (55,000 cpm/nmol) with 5 μmol of GSH ethyl ester in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by following the consumption of HNE at 224 nm. The GS-HNE-ester conjugate was purified by reverse phase HPLC as described below. For the synthesis of the reduced form of the esterified glutathione-HNE conjugate (GS-DHN-ester), 100 nmol of GS-HNE-ester was incubated with 300 nmol of NADPH and 100 μg of aldose reductase in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, for 3 h at 37°C. The reaction was monitored by following the consumption of NADPH at 340 nm. At the end of the incubation, the GS-DHN-ester conjugate was separated from GS-HNE-ester by reverse phase HPLC as described below. HPLC Analysis—Synthesized standards and metabolites of GS-HNE and GS-DHN-esters were separated by HPLC using a Varian reverse phase ODS C18 column pre-equilibrated with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. The compounds were eluted using a gradient consisting of solvent A (0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B (100% acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The gradient was established such that solvent B reached 24% in 20 min, 26% in 30 min, and was held at this value for 10 min. Furthermore, in the next 10 min solvent B reached 60%, and in an additional 5 min it reached 100% and was held at this value for 10 min. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—Chemical identities of the GS-HNE and GS-DHN-esters were established by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS). The samples were analyzed on a single quadrapole Micromass LCZ instrument as described before (40Ramana K.V. Dixit B.L. Srivastava S. Balendiran G.K. Srivastava S.K. Bhatnagar A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12172-12180Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The ESI+/MS operating parameters were as follows: capillary voltage, 3.0 kV; cone voltage, 13 V; extractor voltage, 9 V; source block temperature, 100 °C; and dissolvation temperature, 200 °C. Nitrogen at 3 p.s.i. was used as nebulizer gas. Samples were reconstituted in 50 μl of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (50/50/0.1) (v/v/v), and applied to the mass spectrophotometer using a Harvard syringe pump at a rate of 5 μl/min. Spectra were acquired at the rate of 200 atomic mass units/s over the range of 20 –2000 atomic mass units. Metabolism of GS-HNE and GS-DHN-esters in VSMC—The growth arrested rat VSMC (2 × 106/well in six-well plates) were incubated with radiolabeled GS-[3H]HNE and GS-[3H]DHN esters (1 μm; ∼51,000 cpm) for 0, 30, 60, 120 min, and 24 h in a humidified CO2 incubator. The culture media were separated, filtered by using Amicon Centriprep 3-kDa membrane, and subjected to HPLC analysis as described above. Cell Growth Studies—The rat VSMC were grown in DMEM and harvested by trypsinization and plated in a 96-well plate at a density of 5,000 cells/well. Cells were grown for 24 h in the indicated media and growth-arrested at 60–80% confluency for 24 h in media containing 0.1% FBS. Low serum levels were maintained during growth arrest to prevent slow apoptosis that accompanies complete serum deprivation of these cells. The growth-arrested cells were treated with (0.5-μm each of) HNE, GS-HNE-ester, and GS-DHN-ester, in the absence and presence of AR inhibitors, sorbinil or tolrestat (10 μm each). The rate of cell proliferation or apoptosis was determined by cell counts and MTT assay. To examine the role of RLIP76 (76-kDa Ral-binding, Rho/Rac-GAP, and Ral effector protein) and MRP-2 (multidrug resistance-associated protein-2) in mediating cell growth, growth-arrested VSMC were treated with peptide-specific antibodies raised against RLIP76 or MRP-2 for 1 h followed by incubation with GS-DHN-ester (0 –5 μm) and the rates of cell proliferation or apoptosis were determined as described above. To study the effect of glutathione depletion, VSMC grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS were treated with or without 25 μm BSO for 12 h. The media was then replaced with fresh DMEM containing 0.1% FBS. The cells were continuously cultured in the 0.1% FBS media without or with BSO in the absence or presence of HNE (1 μm), GS-HNE-ester (0.75 μm), or GS-DHN-ester (0.75 μm) for another 24 h. The rate of cell proliferation or apoptosis was determined by cell count and MTT assay. Antisense Ablation of AR—Antisense ablation of AR (AKR1B4) was carried out as described (43Ramana K. Chandra D. Srivastava S. Bhatnagar A. Aggarwal B.B. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32063-32070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, VSMC were transfected with 1 μm AR antisense and mismatch control oligonucleotides in Opti-MEM for 12 h using Lipofectamine Plus (15 μg/ml) as a transfection reagent as described by the supplier's instructions. After 12 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM (10% FBS). The cells were grown in this medium for another 12 h and were then incubated with low serum DMEM (0.1% FBS) for 24 h for serum starvation. Overexpression and RNA Interference Ablation of RLIP76—The VSMC were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector containing RLIP76 cDNA, or with the vector alone, using a Lipofectamine Plus reagent as per supplier's instructions (Invitrogen). Overexpression of RLIP was monitored by Western blot analysis, using peptide-specific RLIP76 antibodies. To ablate RLIP76, siRNAs were designed to target the coding sequence of RLIP76. The target sequences (AAGAAAAAGCCAATTCAGGAGCC corresponding to nucleotide 508 –528 of RLIP76 starting from AUG codon in the open reading frame) were directed to the single-strand region according to the predicted secondary RNA structure. Sequences of the form (AA/CA) N19 with GC content <55% were selected from this region. Control non-silencing siRNA (fluorescein) was obtained from Qiagen. VSMC grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 were seeded on 6- or 96-well plates. When the cells reached 60 –70% confluence (in 24 h), the media was replaced with fresh DMEM without serum, and the cells were incubated with siRNA to a final concentration of 100 nmol/liter and the RNAiFect™ transfection reagent (Qiagen) as per the supplier's instructions. After incubation for 15 min at 25 °C, the medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% serum added dropwise to the cells. The cells were cultured for 48 h at 37 °C (5% CO2), and changes in RLIP76 expression were determined by Western blotting using anti-RLIP76 antibodies. Electrophoretic Mobility Gel Shift Assays—Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (43Ramana K. Chandra D. Srivastava S. Bhatnagar A. Aggarwal B.B. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32063-32070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consensus oligonucleotides for NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors were 5′-end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The assay procedure was as described before (43Ramana K. Chandra D. Srivastava S. Bhatnagar A. Aggarwal B.B. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32063-32070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts prepared from various control and treated cells were incubated with the labeled oligonucleotides for NF-κB or AP-1 for 15 min at 37 °C, and the DNA-protein complex formed was resolved on 6.5% native polyacrylamide gels. The specificity of binding was examined by competition with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide. Supershift assay was also performed to determine the specificity of NF-κB binding to its specific consensus sequence by using anti-p65 antibodies. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried by using a vacuum gel dryer and autoradiographed on Kodak x-ray films. The radiolabeled bands were quantified by an Alpha Imager 2000 Scanning Densitometer equipped with AlphaEase™ version 3.3b software. Measurement of PKC—The PKC activity was measured by using the Promega-Signa TECT™ total PKC assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, aliquots of the reaction (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.6 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.16 mg/ml diacylglycerol, and 50 mm MgCl2) were mixed with [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/μl) and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. To stop the reaction, 7.5 m guanidine hydrochloride was added and the phosphorylated peptide was separated on binding paper. The extent of phosphorylation was detected by measuring radioactivity retained on the paper. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. and the p values were determined using the unpaired Student's t test. Purification and Characterization of GS-HNE and GS-DHN-esters—Because glutathione conjugates do not readily traverse cell membranes, to facilitate their entry GS-HNE and GS-DHN-esters were synthesized and purified by HPLC with retention times of 28 and 31 min, respectively (Fig. 1A). ESI+/MS of HPLC peak I (Fig. 1B) showed a strong molecular ion with an m/z value of 494.2, consistent with GS-DHN-ester, and that of peak II showed molecular ions with m/z values of 492.2 and 274.2 representing GS-HNE-ester and its dehydrated daughter ion, respectively (Fig. 1C). Metabolism of GS-HNE and GS-DHN-esters in VSMC—The metabolism of GS-HNE and GS-DHN-esters in VSMC was investigated by quantifying their metabolites in the culture media and cell extracts. The results indicate that at 120 min only ∼30% of GS-DHN-ester added was de-esterified in VSMC and transported out as only GS-DHN (Table 1). Furthermore, when GS-HNE-ester was added to the VSMC, 69% recovered as the GS-HNE-ester and 25% as free GS-HNE in the media. Only 7% radioactivity was eluted at the peak that corresponded to the elution time for DHN/4-hydroxynonanoic acid. No significant amounts (>2%) of the radiolabeled GS-HNE-ester or GS-DHN-ester and their metabolites were found in cell extracts. However, in the culture media, we have observed a time-dependent increase (30, 60, and 120 min, and 24 h) in the GS-HNE and GS-DHN levels and a time-dependent decrease in GS-HNE- and GS-DHN-esters (Table-1). These results suggest that GS-DHN does not dissociate, whereas some dissociation of GS-HNE could occur in VSMC.TABLE 1Metabolism of GS-HNE and GS-DHN-esters in VSMCIncubation timeCulture media applied to HPLCRecoveryPeak 1Peak2Peak 3cpmcpm (%)GS-HNE-ester 0 min48,95847,786 (98.0) 30 min44,1903,790 (8.2)40,105 (87.2)580 (1.1) 60 min46,3107,466 (16.1)36,897 (76.8)2,080 (4.5) 120 min45,86911,755 (25.6)31,258 (69.1)3,084 (6.8) 24 h46,50912,105 (26.0)22,340 (56.7)3,896 (8.7)GS-DHN-ester 0 min50,15049,852 (99.0) 30 min46,5894,160 (8.9)40,370 (86.6) 60 min42,3607,248 (17.1)32,030 (75.6) 120 min45,58113,810 (30.2)30,865 (67.7) 24 h45,67514,235 (31.1)29,670 (64.9) Open table in a new tab Mitogenic Effects of HNE and Its Metabolites in VSMC—To examine changes in cell growth, early passage, serum-starved rat VSMC were incubated with either HNE or its glutathione conjugates: GS-HNE and GS-DHN. In agreement with our previous observations (36Ruef J. Rao G.N. Li F. Bode C. Patterson C. Bhatnagar A. Runge M.S. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we found that incubation with HNE increased cell growth. A similar increase in growth was observed when the cells were incubated with GS-HNE- and GS-DHN-esters. As shown in Fig. 2, all three reagents, HNE, GS-HNE, and GS-DHN, increased cell proliferation at low concentrations, as determined by counting the number of cells and the MTT assay. With HNE, maximal stimulation of cell growth was evident at a concentration of 1 μm. Similarly, the glutathione conjugates stimulated cell growth at a maximal concentration of 0.75 μm, indicating that conjugation with glutathione does not abolish the mitogenic effects of HNE and that the glutathione conjugate of HNE whether untransformed or reduced is as potent a mitogen as the parent aldehyde. Incubation of the cells with HNE or its glutathione conjugates at concentrations >1 μm led to a concentration-dependent increase in cell death. Significant loss of viability was observed when the cells were incubated with HNE or its conjugates at concentrations exceeding 5 μm. Such biphasic effects of HNE, with growth stimulation at low concentrations and cytotoxicity at high concentrations, have been reported before (36Ruef J. Rao G.N. Li F. Bode C. Patterson C. Bhatnagar A. Runge M.S. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and are consistent with the behavior of other oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (46Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Lassegue B. Ushio-Fukai M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2175-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Interestingly, high concentrations of the glutathione conjugates were also cytotoxic and both GS-HNE and GS-DHN at concentrations exceeding 5 μm induced cell death (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar effects of HNE and its glutathione conjugates on cell growth suggest that all three reagents (HNE, GS-HNE, and GS-DHN) are equally mitogenic. Alternatively, conjugation with glutathione may be an essential “activation” step such that the glutathione conjugate, but not HNE per se, is the proximal mitogen. To distinguish between"
https://openalex.org/W1987969155,"Niemann-Pick type C disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to massive accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in late endosomes and lysosomes. To understand how cholesterol accumulation influences late endosome function, we investigated the effect of elevated cholesterol on Rab9-dependent export of mannose 6-phosphate receptors from this compartment. Endogenous Rab9 levels were elevated 1.8-fold in Niemann-Pick type C cells relative to wild type cells, and its half-life increased 1.6-fold, suggesting that Rab9 accumulation is caused by impaired protein turnover. Reduced Rab9 degradation was accompanied by stabilization on endosome membranes, as shown by a reduction in the capacity of Rab9 for guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor-mediated extraction from Niemann-Pick type C membranes. Cholesterol appeared to stabilize Rab9 directly, as liposomes loaded with prenylated Rab9 showed decreased extractability with increasing cholesterol content. Rab9 is likely sequestered in an inactive form on Niemann-Pick type C membranes, as cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptors were missorted to the lysosome for degradation, a process that was reversed by overexpression of GFP-tagged Rab9. In addition to using primary fibroblasts isolated from Niemann-Pick type C patients, RNA interference was utilized to recapitulate the disease phenotype in cultured cells, greatly facilitating the analysis of cholesterol accumulation and late endosome function. We conclude that cholesterol contributes directly to the sequestration of Rab9 on Niemann-Pick type C cell membranes, which in turn, disrupts mannose 6-phosphate receptor trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2138976254,"Ceramide is a key lipid molecule necessary to regulate some cellular processes, including apoptosis and cell differentiation. In this context, its production has been shown to occur via sphingomyelin hydrolysis or sphingosine acylation. Here, we show that in human fibroblasts, plasma membrane ceramide is also produced from ganglioside GM3 by detachment of sugar units. Membrane-bound glycosylhydrolases have a role in this process. In fact, the production of ceramide from GM3 has been observed even under experimental conditions able to block endocytosis or lysosomal activity, and the overexpression of the plasma membrane ganglioside sialidase Neu3 corresponded to a higher production of ceramide in the plasma membrane. The increased activity of Neu3 was paralleled by an increase of GM3 synthase mRNA and GM3 synthase activity. Neu3-overexpressing fibroblasts were characterized by a reduced proliferation rate and higher basal number of apoptotic cells in comparison with wild-type cells. A similar behavior was observed when normal fibroblasts were treated with exogenous C2-ceramide."
https://openalex.org/W1985584416,"The proteolytic cleavage of Alzheimer beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and signaling receptor Notch is mediated by the PS/gamma-secretase complex, which consists of presenilins, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2. Although the four components are known to coordinately regulate each other at the protein level, information regarding their transcription regulation is scarce. Here we characterized the 5'-flanking region of the human APH-1A gene and identified a 271-bp fragment containing the transcription initiation site for the promoter activity. Sequence analysis, mutagenesis, and gel shift studies revealed a binding of AP4 and HIF-1 to the promoter, which affects the promoter activity. Activation of HIF-1 by short-term NiCl2 treatments (a condition of chemical hypoxia) dramatically increased APH-1A mRNA and protein expression, accompanied by increased secretion of Abeta and decreased APP CTFs formation, indicative of an increase in gamma-secretase activity. NiCl2 treatments had little effect on APP and the other three components of the gamma-secretase complex. The cellular concentration of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) was also increased by the hypoxic treatment. Our results demonstrate that APH-1A expression and the gamma-secretase mediated Abeta and Notch NICD generation are regulated by HIF-1, and the specific control of APH-1A expression may imply physiological functions uniquely assigned to APH-1A."
https://openalex.org/W1974209694,"Hyaluronan exerts a variety of biological effects on cells including changes in cell migration, proliferation, and matrix metabolism. However, the signaling pathways associated with the action of hyaluronan on cells have not been clearly defined. In some cells, signaling is induced by the loss of cell-hyaluronan interactions. The goal of this study was to use hyaluronan oligosaccharides as a molecular tool to explore the effects of changes in cell-hyaluronan interactions and determine the underlying molecular events that become activated. In this study, hyaluronan oligosaccharides induced the loss of extracellular matrix proteoglycan and collagen from cultured slices of normal adult human articular cartilage. This loss was coincident with an increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13. MMP-13 expression was also induced in articular chondrocytes by hyaluronan (HA) hexasaccharides but not by HA tetrasaccharides nor high molecular weight hyaluronan. MMP-13 promoter-reporter constructs in CD44-null COS-7 cells revealed that both CD44-dependent and CD44-independent events mediate the induction of MMP-13 by hyaluronan oligosaccharides. Electromobility gel shift assays demonstrated the activation of chondrocyte NFkappaB by hyaluronan oligosaccharides. NFkappaB activation was also documented in C-28/I2 immortalized human chondrocytes by luciferase promoter assays and phosphorylation of IKK-alpha/beta. The link between activation of NFkappaB and MMP-13 induction by HA oligosaccharides was further confirmed through the use of the NFkappaB inhibitor helenalin. Inhibition of MAP kinases also demonstrated the involvement of p38 MAP kinase in the hyaluronan oligosaccharide induction of MMP-13. Our findings suggest that hyaluronan-CD44 interactions affect matrix metabolism via activation of NFkappaB and p38 MAP kinase."

https://openalex.org/W2127462420,"The microphthalmia transcription factor (Mitf) activates melanocyte-specific gene expression, is critical for survival and proliferation of melanocytes during development, and has been described as an oncogene in malignant melanoma. SWI/SNF complexes are ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes that play a role in many developmental processes. To determine the requirement for SWI/SNF enzymes in melanocyte differentiation, we introduced Mitf into fibroblasts that inducibly express dominant negative versions of the SWI/SNF ATPases, Brahma or Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1). These dominant negative SWI/SNF components have been shown to inhibit gene activation events that normally require SWI/SNF enzymes. We found that Mitf-mediated activation of a subset of endogenous melanocyte-specific genes required SWI/SNF enzymes but that cell-cycle regulation occurred independently of SWI/SNF function. Activation of tyrosinase-related protein 1, a melanocyte-specific gene, correlated with SWI/SNF-dependent changes in chromatin accessibility at the endogenous locus. Both BRG1 and Mitf could be localized to the tyrosinase-related protein 1 and tyrosinase promoters by chromatin immunoprecipitation, whereas immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that Mitf and BRG1 co-localized in the nucleus and physically interacted. Together these results suggest that Mitf can recruit SWI/SNF enzymes to melanocyte-specific promoters for the activation of gene expression via induced changes in chromatin structure at endogenous loci.

Several isoforms of Mitf with cell-specific distribution and activities have been identified in human and mouse cells, including the melanocyte-specific isoform, Mitf-M (12.Udono T. Yasumoto K.

Moreover, Mitf can be alternatively spliced and post-translationally modified by phosphorylation and sumoylation; each variation affects activity and interactions with other proteins (14.Steingrimsson E. Copeland N. Jenkins N.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 365-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In addition to melanocyte-specific genes, Mitf has been shown to regulate a number of other genes, including those involved in cell proliferation, and likely plays a role in melanoma etiology and progression. Mitf can promote melanocyte proliferation by direct activation of the cdk2 promoter (15.Du J. Wudlund H.R. Horstmann M.A. Ramaswamy S. Ross K. Huber W.E. Nishimura E.K. Golub T.R. Fisher D.E. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Conversely, Mitf promotes cell-cycle arrest by direct activation of the p21Cip1 and p16Ink4A promoters and by counteracting B-RAF-stimulated melanocyte and melanoma proliferation (16.Carreira S.G.J.

Mitf has also been designated a “lineage survival oncogene,” because it can activate expression of the anti-apoptotic factor, Bcl2, and, with activated B-RAF, can transform primary human melanocytes (19.McGill G.G. Horstmann M. Widlund H.R. Du J. Motyckova G. Nishimura E.K. Lin Y.L. Ramaswamy S. Avery W. Ding H.F. Jordan S.A. Jackson I.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Golub T.R. Fisher D.E.

Cleavage of Mitf by caspases produces a C-terminal product that can promote apoptosis (21.Larribere L. Hilmi C. Khaled M. Gaggioli C. Bille K. Auberger P. Ortonne J. Ballotti R. Bertolotto C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1980-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recently, the alternatively spliced forms of Mitf have been shown to differ in their ability to inhibit cellular proliferation (22.Bismuth K. Maric D. Arnheiter H. Pigment Cell Res. 2005; 18: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of Mitf activity in melanocyte survival and proliferation is complex and most likely depends on the one or more particular isoforms expressed, post-translational modifications, interactions with other proteins, as well as the specific cellular context. The coordinate activity of gene-specific activators and SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling enzymes has been shown to be important for the activation of genes during cellular differentiation and for regulation of proliferation (23.Pedersen T.A.

Mammalian SWI/SNF enzymes are evolutionarily conserved, multiprotein complexes that contain one of two closely related ATPases, BRM or BRG1, and utilize the energy of ATP to disrupt chromatin structure (31.Wang W.

Although Mitf has been shown to regulate a number of melanocyte-specific genes, little is known about how these genes are activated within their endogenous chromatin context. Mitf can interact with the histone acetyl transferase CBP/p300 to activate target genes; however, it is unclear whether activation of gene expression results from acetylation of histone proteins or by other mechanisms (44.Sato S.

In the current study, we demonstrate that SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling enzymes are necessary for Mitf-mediated activation of melanocyte-specific genes. We show that BRG1 co-localizes and interacts with Mitf and is recruited to and remodels chromatin structure on the promoter of a melanocyte-specific gene. The data establish a requirement for specific chromatin remodeling enzymes during melanocyte-specific gene expression and melanocyte differentiation. Cell Culture and Plasmids—The mouse plus isoform of the melanocyte-specific Mitf (Mitf-M) was generously provided by Thomas Hornyak (NCI, National Institutes of Health) and subcloned into the pBabe vector (9.Hodgkinson C.A.

Cells were cultured in the presence (dominant negative expression OFF) or absence (dominant negative expression ON) of tetracycline for 3 days and were infected at 50% confluence with pBabe-Mitf retrovirus or with retrovirus generated from the empty pBabe vector as previously described (28.de la Serna I.L.

A low serum medium containing 2% horse serum and 2 μg/ml puromycin was then added, and cells were harvested 40 h later. B16 (F0) mouse melanoma cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in media with 10% fetal calf serum. RNA Analysis—RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed as previously described except that 1 μl of cDNA was amplified using Qiagen Master Mix (49.de la Serna I.L. Roy K. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. J.

Immunoprecipitations—Cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in TLB buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) by passing cells through a syringe with a 27-gauge needle. Lysate was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was rocked with 8 μl of rabbit antisera against BRG1, BAF57, Ini1, or with the irrelevant antibody, MyoD, for 12 h, followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and an additional incubation while rocking for 2 h. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and eluted with 2% SDS gel loading buffer. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were plated on coverslips, washed twice with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and washed twice with ice-cold PBS/0.1% Tween 20.A1h incubation with blocking buffer (10% goat serum/0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) was followed by an overnight incubation with rat anti-BRG1 monoclonal antibody and mouse anti-Mitf antibody (C-5, Abcam) at 4 °C. Coverslips were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS/0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody and Alexa568-labeled goat anti rat antibody (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were again washed three times in 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS and mounted in Prolong (Molecular Probes). Images were visualized using a confocal laser microscope (Leica). Co-localization efficiency was analyzed as described (54.van Steensel B. van Binnendijik E.P. Hornsby C.D. van der Voort H.T.M. Krozowski Z.S. de Kloet E.R. van Driel R. J.

A negative value of Δx indicates that the red image was rotated in the counterclockwise direction, and a positive value indicates a rotation in the clockwise direction. Pearson's correlation coefficient (γp) was calculated for each value of Δx and plotted against Δx to get the CCF (54.van Steensel B. van Binnendijik E.P. Hornsby C.D. van der Voort H.T.M.

ChIP experiments were also quantified by real-time PCR using a Hot Start Sybr Green Master Mix (Qiagen) and amplified on a 7500 real-time Thermocycler (ABI). Threshold cycle values were determined for each ChIP and standardized to their respective inputs using the 7500 SDS software. Restriction Enzyme Accessibility—Restriction enzyme accessibility experiments using a ligation-mediated (LM)-PCR protocol were performed as previously described (55.de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y.

Briefly, nuclei were isolated and digested with either DraI or PvuII, and the genomic DNA was purified. One microgram of digested DNA was ligated to the LM-PCR1 and LM-PCR2 adaptors using the Takara Ligation Kit version 2 (57.Carey M. Smale S.T. Transcriptional Regulation in Eukaryotes. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). PCRs were performed at 94 °C for 15 min, followed by 24 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min in the presence of [32P]dATP; the products were run on a 5% polyacrylamide gel then detected and quantified with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The primers used for detection of Trp1 were LM-PCR1 (57.Carey M. Smale S.T. Transcriptional Regulation in Eukaryotes. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) and a primer in the upstream region of Trp1: 5′-GAGGCTGGCATCCATATGTCAGTCAAAG-3′. Inputs were monitored by amplifying the same samples used for LM-PCR with the primers used in the ChIP assay. The primers to myogenin were previously described (55.de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y.

Transcription of a Subset of Melanocyte-specific Genes Is Inhibited by Dominant Negative BRM and BRG1—Mitf has been shown to regulate a number of melanocyte-specific genes, including those involved in melanin biosynthesis (tyrosinase, Trp1, and Dct). Mitf also regulates the melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc-1r) and Pmel17, a membrane glycoprotein important for melanosome structure (58.Adachi S. Morii E. Kim D. Ogihara H. Jippo T. Ito A. Lee Y.M.

Ectopic expression of Mitf into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts causes differentiation into melanocyte-like cells that are dendritic and that express melanocyte-specific genes (7.Tachibana M. Takeda K. Nobukuni Y. Urabe K. Long J.E. Meyers K.A. Aaronson S.A. Miki T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We previously described fibroblast cell lines that inducibly express dominant negative versions of BRM or BRG1 under the control of the tetVP16 activator (48.de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Hill D.A. Guidi C.J. Stephenson R.O. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2839-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To determine whether SWI/SNF enzymes play a role in melanocyte-specific gene expression, we introduced Mitf by retroviral infection into a control tetVP16 cell line, a dominant negative BRM cell line (H17), and a dominant negative BRG1 cell line (B22) that had been grown in the presence or absence of tetracycline and then cultured in low serum media to promote differentiation. Fig. 1A shows FLAG-tagged dominant negative BRM and BRG1 expression in H17 and B22 cells, respectively, when the cells were cultured in the absence of tetracycline and demonstrates that ectopic expression of the Mitf protein occurred. Mitf is phosphorylated at multiple sites, and the two bands that we detected most likely represent the hypo- and hyperphosphorylated forms (62.Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T.

https://openalex.org/W2026489455,"A previous study showed that ∼25–50% of rabbit ileal brush border (BB) Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 is in lipid rafts (LR) (Li, X., Galli, T., Leu, S., Wade, J. B., Weinman E. J., Leung, G., Cheong, A., Louvard, D., and Donowitz, M. (2001) J. Physiol. (Lond.) 537, 537–552). Here, we examined the role of LR in NHE3 transport activity using a simpler system: opossum kidney (OK) cells (a renal proximal tubule epithelial cell line) containing NHE3. ∼50% of surface (biotinylated) NHE3 in OK cells distributed in LR by density gradient centrifugation. Disruption of LR with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) decreased NHE3 activity and increased K′(H+)i, but Km(Na+) was not affected. The MβCD effect was completely reversed by repletion of cholesterol, but not by an inactive analog of cholesterol (cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol). The MβCD effect was specific for NHE3 activity because it did not alter Na+-dependent l-Ala uptake. MβCD did not alter OK cell BB topology and did not change the surface amount of NHE3, but greatly reduced the rate of NHE3 endocytosis. The effects of inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and of MβCD on NHE3 activity were not additive, indicating a common inhibitory mechanism. In contrast, 8-bromo-cAMP and MβCD inhibition of NHE3 was additive, indicating different mechanisms for inhibition of NHE3 activity. Approximately 50% of BB NHE3 and only ∼11% of intracellular NHE3 in polarized OK cells were in LR. In summary, the BB pool of NHE3 in LR is functionally active because MβCD treatment decreased NHE3 basal activity. The LR pool is necessary for multiple kinetic aspects of normal NHE3 activity, including Vmax and K′(H+)i, and also for multiple aspects of NHE3 trafficking, including at least basal endocytosis and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent basal exocytosis. Because the C-terminal domain of NHE3 is necessary for its regulation and because the changes in NHE3 kinetics with MβCD resemble those with second messenger regulation of NHE3, these results suggest that the NHE3 C terminus may be involved in the MβCD sensitivity of NHE3. A previous study showed that ∼25–50% of rabbit ileal brush border (BB) Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 is in lipid rafts (LR) (Li, X., Galli, T., Leu, S., Wade, J. B., Weinman E.

Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 (SLC9A3) is expressed on apical membranes of small intestinal Na+ absorptive epithelial cells and the renal proximal tubule, where it contributes to a large percentage of total NaCl, HCO3−, and water (re)absorption (1Hoogerwerf W.A. Tsao S.C. Devuyst O. Levine S.A. Yun C.H. Yip J.W. Cohen M.E. Wilson P.D. Lazenby A.J. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G29-G41PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zachos N.C. Tse M. Donowitz M.

Rapid regulation of NHE3 activity occurs as part of normal digestive and renal physiology and in the pathophysiology of diarrhea and some renal diseases of the proximal tubule. The acute regulation of the exchanger seems to be mainly through changes in its Vmax, but also involves changes in K′(H+)i (4Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of NHE3 involves at least two different mechanisms: regulation by changes in trafficking due to regulated changes in endocytosis and/or exocytosis and changes in turnover number (5D'Souza S.

NHE3 was shown to be partially in lipid rafts (LR) (12Li X. Galli T. Leu S. Wade J.B. Weinman E. J. Leung Cheong G. Louvard A. Donowitz D.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 537-552Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Concerning NHE3 regulation, the LR pool of BB NHE3 is involved in some of its basal endocytosis and exocytosis and in the acute epidermal growth factor increase of the BB amount of NHE3. However, the contribution of LR to NHE3 function has not been examined in detail. LR are discrete membrane domains that are enriched in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol and that are resistant to solubilization in cold Triton X-100. They are thought to act in the compartmentalization of membrane proteins, separating different biochemical functions and allowing concentration and localization of molecules involved in signal transduction functions (13Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8150) Google Scholar, 14Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 15Lafont F.

The concept that transport proteins distribute in LR and that their activities are LR-dependent is not unique to NHE3, although it has not yet been examined for many transport proteins. Depletion of cholesterol dramatically alters the function of some (Kv2.1 and Kv1.5) but not other (Kv4.2) voltage-gated potassium channels (20Martens J.R. Navarro-Polanco R. Coppock E.A. Nishiyama A.

These include the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR in normal tissue, except when exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa toxin (30Kowalski M.P. Pier G.B. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and intestinal Na+-K+-ATPase (31Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.-L. Thorsen E. Immerdal L. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol.

In this study, the opossum kidney (OK) renal proximal tubule epithelial cell line was used to provide a simple model to examine the contribution of LR to NHE3 activity. An advantage of this cell line is that it is a polarized epithelial Na+ absorptive cell line that contains NHE3 as the sole plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger. It also lacks other regulatory elements (nerves, endocrine cells, inflammatory cells) that are present in intact intestine and that might also act by LR-dependent processes.

Cell Lines—Studies were carried out in OK/E3V (generously provided by Dr. J. Noël, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada) and OK/3HA-E3V cell lines. OK/E3V cells are an OK proximal tubule cell line generated by stable transfection of OK-Tina cells, which are OK cells previously selected by acid suicide to lack endogenous NHE3 activity, with a cDNA for rat NHE3 tagged at the C terminus with the vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) protein epitope (32Noël J. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 929-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The OK/3HA-E3V cell line stably expresses rabbit NHE3 tagged with three copies of the influenza virus HA epitope at the N terminus and with the VSV-G epitope at the C terminus. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle' medium (DMEM)/nutrient mixture F-12 (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Confluent monolayers on plastic dishes, glass coverslips, or filters were serum-depleted for 24–48 h before study. Cells from every new passage were exposed to an acute acid loading selection to maintain a high level of NHE3 protein expression as described previously (4Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification. In brief, cells were exposed to 50 mm NH4Cl/saline solution for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation in isotonic 2 mm Na+ solution. Plasmid Construction and Cell Transfections—For immunological detection (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) of NHE3 protein, three copies of the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) were inserted into the first extracellular loop of rabbit NHE3 between Glu37 and Ile38 by PCR. The pECE plasmid with cDNA encoding rabbit NHE3 with the VSV-G epitope at the C terminus as described (8Akhter S. Cavet M.E. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1990-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and containing unique HindIII and XhoI restriction endonuclease sites inserted into the coding region of NHE3 and XbaI after the VSV-G epitope was used as template in the PCRs. Four primers were designed to introduce the triple HA epitope: sense primer 1 (CCCCAAGCTTATGTCAGGGCGCGGGGGCTGCGGCCC, containing the HindIII endonuclease restriction site (underlined)) and antisense primer 1 (CGCGGATCCagcgtagtcggggacgtcgtaggggtaACCagcgtagtcggggacgtcgtaggggtaACCCTCATCGTGATGCTCCTGCTC, containing the first and second HA epitopes (lowercase) and the BamHI restriction endonuclease site (underlined); and sense primer 2 CGCGGATCCtacccctacgacgtccccgactacgctGGACGCGTGATCCAGGGCTTCCAGATAGTC, containing the third HA epitope (lowercase) and BamHI and MluI restriction endonuclease sites (underlined)) and antisense primer 2 (CTAGTCTAGATTGGTACCTT, containing the XbaI restriction site (underlined)). The primers were extended with Pfu polymerase, resulting in the generation of two mutated cDNAs containing the desired insertion. The two DNA fragments obtained by PCR were ligated to each other and then subcloned into the HindIII-XbaI cloning site of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). All constructs studied were sequenced. Mutated NHE3 cDNA was called 3HA-E3V. The pcDNA3.1/3HA-E3V and empty vector (pcDNA3.1(+)) plasmids were stably transfected into OK-Tina cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Several stably transfected clones were picked, expanded, and used for ELISA as well as for transport assays. The cDNA encoding SGLT1 subcloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector was a gift from Dr. Suketa (University of Shizuoka, Shizuoka, Japan). For transient expression of SGLT1, OK/E3V cells were seeded at 75–80% confluence onto 24-well plates 24 h prior to transfection and then transfected with 1 μg of the corresponding plasmid DNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 as described above. After 6 h of incubation with the DNA-lipid complexes, the cells were exposed to serum-containing DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12. 3 days after transfection, cells were used for Na+-dependent glucose uptake assays. Measurement of Na+/H+ Exchange Activity—Na+/H+ exchange activity was determined as the initial rate of Na+-induced recovery of cytosolic pH (pHi) after an acute acid load caused by prepulsing with NH4Cl, and pHi was measured fluorometrically using BCECF-AM as described previously (33Levine S.A. Nath S.K. Yun C.H. Yip J.W. Montrose M. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13716-13725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements (excitation at 490 and 440 nm with emission at 530 nm) were made using SLM-Aminco SPF-500C and Photon Technology International spectrofluorometers. Briefly, OK/E3V or OK/3HA-E3V cells were grown on glass coverslips to 100% confluency. The monolayers were incubated in serum-free DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 for 24–48 h prior to use. Cells were loaded with 10 μm BCECF-AM in Na+/NH4Cl medium (88 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, and 50 NH4Cl, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37 °C. During the dye loading and NH4Cl prepulse, cells were treated with test agents or vehicle. The cells were initially perfused with TMA+ medium (130 mm tetramethylammonium (TMA) chloride, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), resulting in stable acidification of the cells. Then, Na+ medium (138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) was added, which induced alkalinization of the cells. To determine the kinetics for external Na+ ions, the Na+ concentration in Na+ medium was varied (5, 10, 15, 75, and 138 mm) while maintaining the osmolarity with TMA chloride. For these experiments, cells were acidified to the same level with 50 mm NH4Cl. To calibrate the relationship between the excitation ratio (F500/450) and pHi, the K+/nigericin method was used. As described previously (33Levine S.A. Nath S.K. Yun C.H. Yip J.W. Montrose M. Donowitz M. Tse C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13716-13725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), Na+/H+ exchange rates (H+ efflux) were calculated as the product of Na+-dependent change in pHi and the buffering capacity at each pHi and were analyzed using the nonlinear regression data analysis program Origin, which allows fitting of data to a general allosteric model described by the Hill equation (v = Vmax·[S]napp/K′ + [S]napp, where v is velocity, [S] is the substrate concentration, napp is the apparent Hill coefficient, and K is the affinity constant), with estimates for Vmax and K′(H+)i and their respective errors (S.E.), as well as fitting to a hyperbolic curve such as would be expected with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Data from each coverslip were calculated and analyzed as described above. For each independent experiment, results from all coverslips for each condition were analyzed together. Uptake Studies—Uptake of MGP or l-alanine was assayed in the presence and absence of Na+ as described previously (34Malström K. Stange G. Murer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 902: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 35Van den Bosch L. de Smedt H. Borghgraf R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For uptake experiments, OK/E3V cells were plated onto 24-well plates. Confluent cell monolayers were incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h before the uptake experiments. Transiently transfected OK/E3V cells (for MGP uptake) were used ∼72 h after transfection and incubated in serum-free DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 for 6 h before study. Cell monolayers were treated with 10 mm MβCD or with H2O as a vehicle for 30 min at 37 °C and then washed twice with TMA+ medium (no glucose). MGP or l-alanine uptake was carried out at room temperature and initiated by addition of 0.1 mm MGP/[14C]MGP (0.4 μCi/ml) or 0.2 mml-alanine/l-[3H]alanine (2 μCi/ml). Uptake of substrates was arrested after an appropriate incubation time by aspirating off the radioactive medium and washing three times with ice-cold TMA+ medium without substrate. The radioactivity of isotopes extracted from cell monolayers with 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH (neutralized with HCl) was assayed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The amount of accumulated substrate is expressed as cpm/min/well. Measurement of Surface NHE3—The percentage of total cell NHE3 on the apical surface of OK cells was determined separately by cell-surface biotinylation and modified ELISA (7Kurashima K. D'Souza S. Szaszi K. Ramjeeingh Orlowski R. Grinstein J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29843-29849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For biotinylation, OK/E3V cells were grown to confluent monolayers on plastic dishes, and then the growth was arrested by incubation with serum-free medium for 48 h. Confluent monolayers were treated either with test agent or vehicle at 37 °C under the same conditions used for the detection of NHE3 transport activity and surface-labeled with biotin at 4 °C as described previously (8Akhter S. Cavet M.E. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1990-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All subsequent manipulations were performed at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4); incubated with arginine- and lysine-reactive succinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (0.5 mg/ml; Pierce) in 154 mm NaCl, 10 mm boric acid, 7.2 mm KCl, and 1.8 mm CaCl2,pH 9.0; and washed extensively with quenching buffer containing 20 mm Tris and 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, to scavenge the unbound biotin. Cells were solubilized with 1 ml of N+ buffer (60 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm Na3EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100) and protease inhibitor mixture (catalog number P8340, Sigma), and lysates were centrifuged at 2300 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble cell debris and unbroken cells. Supernatants were diluted with N+ buffer to an equal protein concentration, applied to avidin-agarose beads (Pierce) at 4 °C, and incubated for 16 h. The remaining supernatant was retained as the intracellular fraction. Finally, the avidin-agarose beads were washed five times with N+ buffer, and the biotinylated proteins were recovered from the beads in Laemmli buffer. Several fractions of total, intracellular, and surface pools were separated by SDS-PAGE (9%) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll). The membranes were first incubated with anti-VSV-G monoclonal antibody (P5D4 hybridoma supernatant) as the primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The films were scanned, and the signals were quantified using ImageQuant Version 4.2a software. For ELISA, OK/3HA-E3V cells were used. Cells were plated onto 24-well plates and grown to confluency. 24–48 h before the experiments, cells were incubated in serum-free growth medium. Monolayers were exposed to 10 mm MβCD or vehicle for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with anti-HA antibodies (1:1000 dilution) for 1.5 h at 4 °C to prevent endocytosis. The cells were washed up to six times with 1:9 (v/v) cold growth medium/PBS to remove unbound antibodies and then fixed in 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cell monolayers were washed three times with PBS, incubated in 100 mm glycine in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and then blocked with PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 30 min. Following blocking, the cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (1:500 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature and washed six times with growth medium/PBS. For detection of peroxidase activity, 1 ml of oPD was added to each well and incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by 0.75 m HCl. The supernatants were collected, and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm. The absorbance varied linearly with the amount of peroxidase bound. Serial dilution titration analyses were performed to determine the optimal concentration of reagents used in the ELISA as described (36Hornbeck P. Winston S.E. Fuller S.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology,. 2003; (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York)Google Scholar). The optimal concentrations of primary and secondary antibodies as well as developing reagent (oPD) and cells were serially diluted and analyzed by crisscross matrix analysis. The analyses showed optimal dilutions of 1:1000 and 1:500 for anti-HA primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies, respectively, as well as 1 ml for oPD. NHE3 Endocytosis—The reduced GSH-resistant endocytosis assay described previously by us (37Lee-Kwon W. Kawano K. Choi J.W. Kim J.H. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16494-16501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was used with slight modifications. OK/E3V cells were labeled with 1.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate for 1 h at 4 °Cand quenched at 4 °C. The cells were then warmed to 37 °C and treated with 10 mm MβCD or vehicle for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were rinsed with 3× ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, and then surface biotin was cleaved by washing with 50 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm GSH, pH 8.8. The freshly endocytosed, biotin-labeled proteins were protected from cleavage with GSH. Cells were solubilized in N+ buffer; biotinylated proteins were retrieved and assayed for endocytosed NHE3 as described above. Fluorescently labeled, IRDye™ 800-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc.) were used for immunoblotting. The fluorescence intensity of NHE3 protein bands was visualized using the Odyssey system (LI-COR Biosciences) and quantitated with Meta-Morph Version 5.0r1 software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Sucrose Gradient Density Flotation—To localize NHE3 in OK/E3V cells to LR, total lysate was fractionated by discontinuous sucrose step gradients as described previously (12Li X. Galli T. Leu S.

Arpin M. Hubbard A.L. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C927-C940Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). OK/E3V cells were grown to 100% confluency, serum-starved for 24–48 h, and then treated with 10 mm MβCD or vehicle for 30 min at 37 °C. The monolayers were biotinylated (see “Measurement of Surface NHE3”) and lysed in N+ buffer supplemented with 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture. Total lysates were loaded on 11 discontinuous sucrose step gradients (30, 27.5, 25, 22.5, 20, 17.5, 15, 12.5, 10, 7.5, and 5%). Each step gradient was prepared with sucrose and N+ buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100. Centrifugation was done in a Beckman SW 41Ti rotor at 150,000 × g overnight at 4 °C. Surface NHE3 in each fraction was precipitated by avidin-agarose beads. One-quarter of each fraction (total and surface NHE3) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and densitometric analysis using ImageQuant Version 4.2a software. Labeling the Apical Cell Surface with Fluorescent Lectin and Fluorescence Microscopy—To examine the changes in apical membrane structure caused by MβCD treatment, surface labeling with a fluorescent lectin was used (39Kovbasnjuk O.N. Spring K.R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Lectins bind to specific sugar residues of the glycocalyx; and at 4 °C, the fluorescent markers remain on the apical surface of the monolayers for several hours. OK/E3V cells were grown and treated under the same conditions that were used for Na+/H+ exchange activity assay. The apical surfaces of control and treated cells were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugate"

https://openalex.org/W1988072810,"In inflamed tissue, normal signal transduction pathways are altered by extracellular signals. For example, the JNK pathway is activated in psoriatic skin, which makes it an attractive target for treatment. To define comprehensively the JNK-regulated genes in human epidermal keratinocytes, we compared the transcriptional profiles of control and JNK inhibitor-treated keratinocytes, using DNA microarrays. We identified the differentially expressed genes 1, 4, 24, and 48 h after the treatment with SP600125. Surprisingly, the inhibition of JNK in keratinocyte cultures in vitro induces virtually all aspects of epidermal differentiation in vivo: transcription of cornification markers, inhibition of motility, withdrawal from the cell cycle, stratification, and even production of cornified envelopes. The inhibition of JNK also induces the production of enzymes of lipid and steroid metabolism, proteins of the diacylglycerol and inositol phosphate pathways, mitochondrial proteins, histones, and DNA repair enzymes, which have not been associated with differentiation previously. Simultaneously, basal cell markers, including integrins, hemidesmosome and extracellular matrix components, are suppressed. Promoter analysis of regulated genes finds that the binding sites for the forkhead family of transcription factors are over-represented in the SP600125-induced genes and c-Fos sites in the suppressed genes. The JNK-induced proliferation appears to be secondary to inhibition of differentiation. The results indicate that the inhibition of JNK in epidermal keratinocytes is sufficient to initiate their differentiation program and suggest that augmenting JNK activity could be used to delay cornification and enhance wound healing, whereas attenuating it could be a differentiation therapy-based approach for treating psoriasis."
https://openalex.org/W2081351704,"Versican is one of the major extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the brain. ECM molecules and their cleavage products critically regulate the growth and arborization of neurites, hence adjusting the formation of neural networks. Recent findings have revealed that peptide fragments containing the versican C terminus (G3 domain) are present in human brain astrocytoma. The present study demonstrated that a versican G3 domain enhanced cell attachment, neurite growth, and glutamate receptor-mediated currents in cultured embryonic hippocampal neurons. In addition, the G3 domain intensified dendritic spines, increased the clustering of both synaptophysin and the glutamate receptor subunit GluR2, and augmented excitatory synaptic activity. In contrast, a mutated G3 domain lacking the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats (G3ΔEGF) had little effect on neurite growth and glutamatergic function. Treating the neurons with the G3-conditioned medium rapidly increased the levels of phosphorylated EGF receptor (pEGFR) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), indicating an activation of EGFR-mediated signaling pathways. Blockade of EGFR prevented the G3-induced ERK activation and suppressed the G3-provoked enhancement of neurite growth and glutamatergic function but failed to block the G3-mediated enhancement of cell attachment. These combined results indicate that the versican G3 domain regulates neuronal attachment, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic function of hippocampal neurons via EGFR-dependent and -independent signaling pathway(s).

The ECM molecules and their proteolytic products, via communications with their interacting partners (2Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar), fundamentally regulate growth and arborization of neurite processes of neuronal cells, thus adjusting the formation of functional neuronal networks. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are the major ECM components in the brain and are organized into perineuronal nets. Expression of CSPGs inhibits experience-dependent neural plasticity, whereas their degradation reactivates neural plasticity (3Pizzorusso T. Medini P. Berardi N. Chierzi S. Fawcett J.W. Maffei L. Science. 2002; 298: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar), suggesting a critical role for CSPG metabolism in neural development and plasticity (4Williams C. Villegas M. Atkinson R. Miller C.A. J. Comp Neurol. 1998; 390: 268-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism for the functions of CSPG metabolites remains largely unclear. Versican, one type of CSPG molecule, was originally isolated from human fibroblasts and developing limb buds in the chicken (5Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 6Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later this molecule was found to be highly expressed in the developing and matured mammalian brain (7Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32992-32998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Milev P. Maurel P. Chiba A. Mevissen M. Popp S. Yamaguchi Y. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Four isoforms of versican (V0, V1, V2, and V3) have been identified in various tissues (7Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32992-32998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schmalfeldt M. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol.

V0, the full-length versican, contains both N-(G1) and C-terminal globular domains (G3), together with a large central CS region that is encoded by two exons producing CSα and CSβ domains (Fig. 1A). The exons of CSα and CSβ can be alternatively spliced, thus generating three splice variants of versican; V1 lacks the CSα domain, V2 is devoid of the CSβ domain, and V3 contains neither CS domain. Studies have demonstrated that the tandem repeats in the G1 domain mediate binding of versican to hyaluronan (10LeBaron R.G. Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10003-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Matsumoto K. Shionyu M. Go M. Shimizu K. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Watanabe H. J. Biol.

Zako M. Ujita M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 958-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). More specifically, the G3 domain consists of two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like sequences, a carbohydrate recognition domain, and a complement binding protein-like motif that is structurally similar to the selectin family (Fig. 1A). The expression levels of versican V1 are high in the embryonic brain (8Milev P. Maurel P. Chiba A. Mevissen M. Popp S. Yamaguchi Y. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), whereas V2 is the dominant isoform within the mature central nervous system (8Milev P. Maurel P. Chiba A. Mevissen M. Popp S.

This suggests distinct roles for different versican isoforms during brain development. With respect to this notion, various studies have demonstrated that versican V2 inhibits neurite outgrowth (13Schmalfeldt M. Bandtlow C.E. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 807-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas we recently found that V1 promoted neurite extension (14Wu Y. Sheng W. Chen L. Dong H. Lee V. Lu F. Wong C.S. Lu W.Y. Yang B.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2093-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We propose that the diverse roles of versican isoforms in regulating neuronal morphology may rely on their specific subdomains. To dissect the function of specific versican domains, we examined the effect of the G3 domain of versican on the morphology and synaptic function of cultured embryonic hippocampal neurons. We chose to study the function of the G3 domain because abundant G3-containing fragments of versican are found in human brain astrocytoma (15Zheng P.S. Wen J. Ang L.C. Sheng W. Viloria-Petit A. Wang Y. Wu Y. Kerbel R.S. Yang B.B. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 754-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moreover, the versican G3 exhibits biological actions in numerous cell types (15Zheng P.S.

This study reveals that 1) the versican G3 domain enhances neurite growth as well as the formation of excitatory synapses in hippocampal neurons and 2) the functions of the G3 domain are associated with activation of EGF receptors (EGFRs) via its EGF-like motifs. Expression and Purification of Versican G3 Domains—The construction of recombinant versican G3 and a G3 fragment lacking the EGF-like motifs (G3ΔEGF) (Fig. 1A) has been described previously (16Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 19Yang B.L. Cao L. Kiani C. Lee V. Zhang Y. Adams M.E. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21255-21261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNAs corresponding to the G3 and G3ΔEGF domains of chicken versican (6Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were subcloned in a mammalian expression vector (pcDNA3). The leading peptide of link protein (nucleotides 1-180) was joined with the versican G3 or G3ΔEGF domains to allow secretion of the gene products (16Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This leading peptide serves a dual role: it contains a signal peptide for product secretion and an epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody 4B6 (20Binette F. Cravens J. Kahoussi B. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19116-19122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, a His epitope was added to the C terminus of the constructs for staining and purification purposes. The G3 and G3ΔEGF constructs were stably expressed in astrocytoma cell line U87 (17Wu Y. Zhang Y. Cao L. Chen L. Lee V. Zheng P.S. Kiani C. Adams M.E. Ang L.C. Paiwand F. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14178-14186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins containing the C-terminal His tag in the culture media were subjected to purification, using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity columns, under native conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The purity of G3 and G3ΔEGF peptides were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and Western blots (Fig. 1B) probed with the monoclonal antibody 4B6 that recognizes an epitope in the leading protein (21Kiani C. Lee V. Cao L. Chen L. Wu Y. Zhang Y. Adams M.E. Yang B.B. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Lee V. Chen L. Paiwand F. Cao L. Wu Y. Inman R. Adams M.E. Yang B.B. J.

To study the effects of the versican G3 peptides on neuronal morphology and function, the peptides were added into the media at different time points or coated on the culture dishes/coverslips (see below). Versican G3-conditioned Medium—Primary cultures of cortical glial cells were made following a modified protocol described previously (23Ruzicka B.B. Fox C.A. Thompson R.C. Meng F. Watson S.J. Akil H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 34: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in the embryonic rat cortex were dissociated by mechanical trituration. The cortical cells were plated in dishes (Falcon) at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. On the 14th day in vitro (DIV), the cells were stripped and replated for further culture. Under these conditions, only glial cells continued to proliferate. At 90% confluence, the glial cells were transiently transfected with G3 or vector, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One day after the transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh B27-supplemented neurobasal medium (Invitrogen). The conditioned media were collected 3 days after cell transfection. The expression of G3 in the cortical glial cells and the secreted G3 in the conditioned medium were confirmed by immunoblot using 4B6 (Fig. 1C). According to our previous results (16Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the concentration of the G3 products in the media was ∼1.0 μg/ml. Coating Culture Dish/Coverslip with the Versican Peptides—The 12-well plastic dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) that contain an 18-mm-diameter glass coverslip or 35-mm dishes were filled with the purified G3 solution or the protein purification buffer serving as a control. The peptide and control solutions were left in the dishes overnight (for about 15 h) at 4 °C and removed on the next morning. Following a rinse with PBS, the glass coverslips and dishes were then recoated with poly-d-lysine (PDL). For another set of experiments, dishes/coverslips were coated with PDL alone. ELISA—The amount of G3 peptide bound to coverslips was determined by ELISA (colorimetric) assay as previously described (24Lu W. Man H. Ju W. Trimble W.S. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T. Neuron. 2001; 29: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) with modifications. In brief, after removing the G3 peptide, the coverslips were gently rinsed with PBS and then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 1 h. The coverslips were incubated with the monoclonal antibody 4B6 overnight. Afterward the coverslips were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences), horseradish peroxidase substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydro-chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to produce a color reaction. The optical density was measured using a spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 1000; Amersham Biosciences). Preparation and Treatment of Cultured Hippocampal Neurons—Dissociated embryonic hippocampal neurons were cultured on coverslips/dishes that were coated in different materials as described above. The procedures for cell dissociation and culture were described previously (25Dong H. Xiang Y.Y. Farchi N. Ju W. Wu Y. Chen L. Wang Y. Hochner B. Yang B. Soreq H. Lu W.Y. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8950-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampal cells from Wistar rat embryos at day 18 were isolated by mechanical trituration and then plated in control and G3-coated dishes at a density of 6 × 104 cells/cm2 in standard plating medium, which contains neurobasal medium (Invitrogen), B27 (1:50, Invitrogen), 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 25 μm glutamic acid, 0.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 0.5% fetal bovine serum. To examine the effect of versican peptides on neuronal cell attachment, morphology, and function, versican peptides were included in the plating medium at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. The neurons were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Eighteen hours after plating, the plating medium was replaced with culture medium containing neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (50:1) and l-glutamine (0.5 mm). This culture medium supports neuronal growth while restricting the expansion of other cell types (26Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). To separate the effect of G3 peptides on cell attachment from the effect on neuronal morphology and function, the peptides (50 ng/ml) were added in the culture medium on the 3rd DIV. In some experiments, the specific EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was included in the plating or culture medium. Neurons were used at different DIV as stated under “Results.” Analysis of Neurite Growth and Dendritic Spines—To examine the short (18th h) and long (7th DIV) term effects of versican peptides on the growth of neurites and dendritic spines, digital images of neurons in different conditions were taken using an inverted light microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) equipped with a digital camera (Nicon Coolpix 4500). For studying the growth of dendritic spines, neurons (7th DIV) were transfected with a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the neurons were washed with DPBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde mixed with 4% sucrose in DPBS. Images of randomly selected individual GFP-expressing neurons on control and G3-coated coverslips were taken (in each group, n ≥ 30 cells) using a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) at 63× and/or 100× magnifications. The digital images of neurites and dendritic spines from randomly selected image fields were analyzed using the Image J program (National Institutes of Health). For analyzing the neurite length of neurons 18 h after plating, the longest neurite of an individual neuron was measured. For 7th DIV neurons, the neurite density was semi-quantitatively analyzed by measuring the neurite-covered area (pixels). In some experiments, the fluorescent area of individual GFP-expressing neurons was analyzed. To determine the density of dendritic spines, the length of randomly selected secondary dendrites of GFP-expressing neurons was measured, the number of spines on the dendrites was counted, and the averaged number of spines/20-μm length of neurite was determined. Patch Clamp Recordings—To study the effects of versican G3 on the function of the major transmitter receptors in neurons, glutamate- and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-evoked currents were evaluated. Conventional whole cell recordings were made in cultured neurons on the 2nd or 8th DIV unless specified otherwise. Neurons in the G3-coated and sister control dishes were randomly selected under a microscope. Recordings were performed under voltage clamp (at -60 mV) by means of an Axopatch-1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Electrodes as well as the extracellular and intracellular solutions were made as previously described (25Dong H. Xiang Y.Y. Farchi N. Ju W. Wu Y. Chen L. Wang Y. Hochner B. Yang B. Soreq H. Lu W.Y. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8950-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cell capacitance was measured using the Clampex program (Axon Instruments). Rapid application of receptor agonists to the cells was achieved via a computer-controlled multibarrel perfusion system (SF-77B; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Electrical signals were digitized, filtered (1-2 kHz), and acquired on-line by means of Clampex. The peak amplitude of evoked currents was measured off-line using the program Clampfit (Axon Instruments). For recording of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), 0.5 μm of tetrodotoxin and 20 μm of bicuculline methiodide were included in the extracellular solution. In each recording, at least 120-200 mEPSC events were collected for analysis. The amplitude and frequency of mEPSCs were analyzed using the program Mini-analysis (Synaptosoft Inc., Decatur, GA). All of the recordings were performed at room temperature (22-24 °C). Immunoblot—To test the effect of G3 on the expression of synaptic and intracellular signaling proteins, we treated neurons with the G3-conditioned medium at different time points. In some dishes, 0.5, 5.0, and 20 μm AG1478 were included in the medium 30 min before and during the G3 stimulation. The vector-conditioned medium was used as a control. For the assays of synaptic proteins, we treated the neurons with the conditioned media 24 h after plating, and the neuronal cells were used on the 7th DIV. The general procedures of Western blotting of neuronal proteins were the same as previously described (25Dong H. Xiang Y.Y. Farchi N. Ju W. Wu Y. Chen L. Wang Y. Hochner B. Yang B. Soreq H. Lu W.Y. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8950-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The following commercially available antibodies were used: anti-NR1 (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ), anti-PSD-95 (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), anti-synaptophysin (Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany), and anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Semi-quantitative analysis of Western blot was performed by means of a GS800 densitometer (Bio-Rad). The blot films were scanned, and the band densities were calculated using the Quantity One program (Bio-Rad). In some experiments, the values of blot densities were normalized to the levels of respective β-actin blots. For detecting ERK phosphorylation, the cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaVO4,10mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitors. For phospho-EGFR detection, the cells were lysed in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaVO4,10mm NaF, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate with protease inhibitors. EGFR and ERK tyrosine phosphorylation were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phospho-EGFR (Tyr1173) or anti-phospho-ERK (Tyr204) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After stripping the blots, the total protein levels of EGFR and ERK were examined by reprobing the same membranes with anti-EGFR or anti-ERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunocytochemistry—The procedure for immunohisto-chemistry was as previously described (25Dong H. Xiang Y.Y. Farchi N. Ju W. Wu Y. Chen L. Wang Y. Hochner B. Yang B. Soreq H. Lu W.Y. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8950-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with modifications. For immunostaining the surface GluR2 subunit, anti-GluR2 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA; 1:2000) was added to the culture medium and incubated with neurons in the incubator for 2 h. Neurons on coverslips were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in DPBS for 30 min. To stain intracellular GluR2, synaptophysin and/or MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2), neurons were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15-30 min, blocked in 5% horse serum or 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, and then incubated with anti-GluR2, anti-synaptophysin (Clone 7.2; Synaptic Systems; 1:1000 dilution), or anti-MAP2 (Chemicon; 1:400) at room temperature for 2 h or at 4 °C overnight. CY3- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were added for incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. After rinsing with DPBS, the coverslips were mounted for confocal microscopic examination. The visual fields under a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) were randomly selected by blindly moving the cell culture coverslip. Digital images were taken with a 63× or 100× objective lens. To determine the densities of synaptic clusters in control and treated neurons, the length of randomly selected dendrites was measured via Image J, and the number of the immunoreactive protein clusters was counted. Thus, the number of protein clusters/20-μm length of dendrite was obtained. Twenty to forty individual neurons in each group were analyzed. Statistical Analysis—Unless specified otherwise, statistical analysis was performed with Sigmaplot software (SPSS, Chicago, IL). The data were expressed as the means ± S.E. and examined using Students' unpaired or paired t tests whenever appropriate. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. The Versican G3 Domain Promotes Neural Cell Attachment and Neurite Growth—As previously reported (27Brewer G.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 674-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), we found that more than 98% of embryonic hippocampal cells grown in the described culture conditions were neurons based on their morphology and their immunoreactivity to MAP2, a neuronal dendritic marker (not shown). With respect to the morphology of developing neurons, the neurites were seen in most neuronal cells by the 18th h after plating (left panel of Fig. 2A). Given that the versican G3 domain increases the adhesion in several cell types (28Wu Y. Chen L. Zheng P.S. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12294-12301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Yang B.L. Yang B.B. Erwin M. Ang L.C. Finkelstein J. Yee A.J. Life Sci. 2003; 73: 3399-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we initially investigated the effects of the versican peptides on the attachment and outgrowth of neurites. Notably, inclusion of the G3 or G3ΔEGF peptide (50 ng/ml) in the plating medium facilitated neural cell attachment (middle and right panels of Fig. 2A), as evidenced by the increase in the number of cells/image field (Fig. 2B). This result indicates that the two versican G3 peptides were biologically reactive. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of G3ΔEGF on neural cell attachment was notably less than that of the unabridged G3 domain (Fig. 2B). We then measured the length of the longest neurite of individual neurons at the 18th h after plating. Remarkably, the neurites of neurons grown in G3-containing medium but not G3ΔEGF-containing medium were significantly longer than that in control dishes (Fig. 2C). Considering that ECM molecules and their proteolytic products often bind with other ECM molecules, we also investigated the effects of versican G3 on cell attachment and growth by coating coverslip with the peptide. ELISA confirmed that the G3 peptide was bound to coverslips (Fig. 2D). We observed that coating the dish/coverslip with versican G3 also significantly enhanced the cell attachment (Fig. 2, E and F) and neurite growth (Fig. 2, E and G). To investigate the long term effect of G3 on neuronal growth, we studied the neurite density of neurons in control and G3-coated dishes on the 8th DIV. We observed that by this developmental stage, neurites ramified with complex fine branches. Notably, neurons on the G3-coated dishes displayed a greater mass of neurites (Fig. 2H). Because it was impracticable to measure the lengths of neurites at this stage, we semi-quantitatively analyzed the neurite density by measuring the area of fluorescent neurites of individual GFP-expressing neurons. We found that the total area of neurites of individual neurons grown in G3-coated dishes increased significantly (Fig. 2I). Considering that nearly all excitatory input in the hippocampus impinges on dendritic spines (30Zhang W. Benson D.L. Hippocampus. 2000; 10: 512-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we subsequently studied the effect of the versican G3 on the growth of dendritic spines of the GFP-expressing neurons on the 8th DIV (Fig. 2J). Significantly more dendritic spines or filopodia were observed in neurons grown on the G3-coated dishes than those grown on control dishes (Fig. 2K). The G3 Domain Promotes Glutamate Receptor-mediated Currents—The action of the G3 peptide on neural morphogenesis led us to examine whether this peptide played a role in regulating neuronal function, specifically the activity of transmitter receptors. Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain. Thus, we began by measuring glutamate-evoked currents at the 18th h after plating in neurons grown in control medium or medium containing G3 or G3ΔEGF peptide (Fig. 3A, panel 1). The peak amplitude of glutamate-evoked currents was approximately four times larger in G3-treated neurons than in controls (Fig. 3A, panel 2). In contrast, the current recorded in the G3ΔEGF-treated neurons was unaltered (Fig. 3A, panel 2). We also studied the long term effect of G3 on glutamate receptor-mediated currents in neurons on the 8th DIV (Fig. 3B, panel 1). The amplitude of glutamate currents recorded in neurons grown on the G3-coated dishes was significantly larger than controls (Fig 3B, panel 2). Similarly, the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA; 100 μm)-evoked current was also enhanced in neurons cultured on G3-coated dishes (Fig. 3C). Moreover, in the presence of 2 μm MK801 (an NMDA subtype glutamate receptor antagonist), the glutamate current in"
https://openalex.org/W2161789938,"MAN1 is an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane that interacts with nuclear lamins and emerin, thus playing a role in nuclear organization. It also binds to chromatin-associated proteins and transcriptional regulators, including the R-Smads, Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3. Mutations in the human gene encoding MAN1 cause sclerosing bone dysplasias, which sometimes have associated skin abnormalities. At the molecular level, these mutations lead to loss of the MAN1-R-Smads interaction, thus perturbing transforming growth factor β superfamily signaling pathway. As a first step to understanding the physical basis of MAN1 interaction with R-Smads, we here report the structural characterization of the carboxyl-terminal nucleoplasmic region of MAN1, which is responsible for Smad binding. This region exhibits an amino-terminal globular domain adopting a winged helix fold, as found in several Smad-associated sequence-specific DNA binding factors. Consistently, it binds to DNA through the positively charged recognition helix H3 of its winged helix motif. However, it does not show the predicted carboxyl-terminal U2AF homology domain in solution, suggesting that the folding and stability of such a domain in MAN1 depend upon binding to an unidentified partner. Modeling the complex between DNA and the winged helix domain shows that the regions involved in DNA binding are essentially distinct from those reported to be involved in Smad binding. This suggests that MAN1 binds simultaneously to R-Smads and their targeted DNA sequences.

This suggests that MAN1 binds simultaneously to R-Smads and their targeted DNA sequences. The nuclear envelope separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. It consists of inner and outer nuclear membranes and nuclear pore complexes. The inner nuclear membrane is closely associated with the underlying chromatin and nuclear lamina. For many years, the nuclear envelope was thought to function mainly as an architectural stabilizer of the nucleus, participating in assembly and disassembly processes during mitosis. However, recent findings demonstrate that nuclear envelope proteins are involved in fundamental nuclear functions, such as chromatin organization and gene expression (1Gruenbaum Y. Margalit A. Goldman R.D. Shumaker D.K. Wilson K.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Inherited or de novo mutations in genes encoding nuclear envelope proteins cause a wide range of human diseases (2Worman H.J. Courvalin J.C. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2005; 246: 231-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These findings emphasize the importance of understanding the functions of the nuclear envelope in both physiologic and pathologic states.MAN1 (also known as LEMD3) is a transmembrane protein of the inner nuclear membrane. It was originally identified as an antigen recognized by self-antibodies from the serum of a patient with a collagen vascular disease (3Paulin-Levasseur M. Blake D.L. Julien M. Rouleau L. Chromosoma. 1996; 104: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4Lin F. Blake D.L. Callebaut I. Skerjanc I.S. Holmer L. McBurney M.W. Paulin-Levasseur M. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4840-4847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). MAN1 is part of a protein complex essential for chromatin organization and cell division. It is analogous to the yeast protein SRC1, which may play a role in sister chromatid separation (5Rodriguez-Navarro S. Igual J.C. Perez-Ortin J.E. Yeast. 2002; 19: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In Xenopus embryos, overexpressed MAN1 induces the formation of a secondary neural axis by binding directly to the MH2 domain of Smad1, Smad5, or Smad8, thus antagonizing bone morphogenetic protein signaling (6Osada S. Ohmori S.Y. Taira M. Development. 2003; 130: 1783-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7Raju G.P. Dimova N. Klein P.S. Huang H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 428-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similarly, in humans MAN1 binds to the MH2 domain of the R-Smads Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3, which mediate signaling by activin, bone morphogenic protein, and transforming growth factor β (8Pan D.

Worman H.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the human gene encoding MAN1 that disrupt this critical interaction cause sclerosing bone dysplasias characterized by increased bone density and sometimes skin abnormalities (10Hellemans J. Preobrazhenska O. Willaert A. Debeer P. Verdonk P.C. Costa T. Janssens K. Menten B. Van Roy N. Vermeulen S.J. Savarirayan R. Van Hul W. Vanhoenacker F. Huylebroeck D. De Paepe A. Naeyaert J.M. Vandesompele J. Speleman F. Verschueren K. Coucke P.J. Mortier G.R. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, mutations in a ubiquitous nuclear envelope protein give rise to relatively tissue-specific disease phenotypes, suggesting a role for MAN1 in the regulation of tissue-specific gene transcription, as has similarly been proposed for nuclear lamins (11Hutchison C.J. Worman H.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Sequence analysis indicates that MAN1 spans the inner nuclear membrane twice, resulting in a protein with amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal nucleoplasmic domains (4Lin F. Blake D.L. Callebaut I. Skerjanc I.S. Holmer L. McBurney M.W. Paulin-Levasseur M. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4840-4847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). At its amino terminus, MAN1 contains a LEM domain that is present in several proteins, including the inner nuclear membrane proteins lamina-associated polypeptide 2 and emerin (4Lin F. Blake D.L.

The entire amino-terminal nucleoplasmic region of MAN1 also binds to the nuclear intermediate filaments lamin A and lamin B1 and to emerin (17Mansharamani M. Wilson K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13863-13870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, it mediates protein-protein interactions through contacts with the chromatin and the nuclear lamina. This domain is also necessary for efficient localization of MAN1 in the inner nuclear membrane (18Wu W. Lin F. Worman H.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here we have examined the three-dimensional structure of the carboxyl-terminal nucleoplasmic region of MAN1, which is responsible for the inhibition of physiologically important signaling pathways through an interaction with several R-Smads (8Pan D.

It comprises a first fragment (amino acids 655-758) showing sequence characteristics of a globular domain and a second fragment (amino acids 782-911) predicted to be an RRM-like protein interaction domain named U2AF homology motif (UHM) 5The abbreviations used are: UHM, U2AF homology motif; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; TSP, 3-(trimethylsilyl)[2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate. 5The abbreviations used are: UHM, U2AF homology motif; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; TSP, 3-(trimethylsilyl)[2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate. (19Kielkopf C.L. Lucke S. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1513-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We report that the first globular domain adopts a three-dimensional structure generally found in DNA binding regions of transcription factors. We show that indeed the entire carboxyl-terminal region of MAN1 is involved in DNA binding and propose that this interaction is synergetic to the binding of MAN1 to different transcriptional regulators, particularly R-Smads.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSample Preparation—All cloning procedures were performed according to standard methods (20Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 1989; (65, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 10.10-10.60Google Scholar). The region from amino acid 655 to amino acid 775 of MAN1 (MAN1CA) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 DE3 pLys S transformed with a construct generated in pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) that encodes glutathione S-transferase and a thrombin cleavage site fused to MAN1CA. The fusion protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and cleaved using thrombin protease. Because of the cloning strategy, the peptide resulting from the cleavage comprises additional residues from 1 to 5, MAN1 residues from 6 to 126, and again additional residues from 127 to 133. Uniformly labeled 15N protein was produced in minimum medium M9 containing 1 g·liter-1 of (15NH4)2SO4 (Boehringer) as the nitrogen source. Uniformly labeled 13C/15N protein was produced in a rich medium prepared from uniformly labeled 13C/15N Spirulina maxima cyanobacteria. The resulting protein was characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy and amino terminus sequencing. NMR samples (∼0.8 mm) were prepared in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 150 mm NaCl in either 90% H2O/10% D2O or in 100% D2O, 1 mm EDTA, a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mm Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, and 1 mm NaN3. 3-(Trimethylsilyl)[2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate (TSP) was added as a chemical shift reference. 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to TSP, using the absolute frequency ratios.The region of MAN1 from amino acid 658 to amino acid 910 (MAN1CB) was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21 DE3 Star transformed with a plasmid that encodes ZZ fusion, a cleavage site for tobacco etch virus, protease and MAN1CB (21Braud S.

It was purified using immunoglobulin IgG-Sepharose™ 6 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) and cleaved using the catalytic domain of tobacco etch virus protease. Uniformly labeled 15N protein was produced in minimum medium M9 containing 1 g·liter-1 of (15NH4)2SO4 (Boehringer) as the nitrogen source. The resulting protein was characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy and amino terminus sequencing. NMR samples of the protein at ∼0.5 mm were prepared in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 6.0) containing 150 mm NaCl in either 90% H2O/10% D2O or in 100% D2O, 1 mm EDTA, a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mm Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, and 1 mm NaN3. TSP was added as a chemical shift reference. 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to TSP, using the absolute frequency ratios. MAN1CA and MAN1CB mutants were generated with QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions.NMR Spectroscopy—All assignment experiments of MAN1CA were performed at 30 °C on Bruker DRX-600 or DRX-900 spectrometers equipped with a triple resonance probe according to the previously reported procedure (22Caputo S. Lin F. Gilquin B. Worman H.J. Zinn-Justin S. Couprie J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear Overhauser effect cross-peak volumes used for structure calculation were measured on five NOESY experiments (a 15N-HSQC-NOESY in H2O and a 13C-HSQC-NOESY in D2O recorded at 900 MHz with a 100-ms mixing time at the European Large Scale Facilities in Utrecht, Netherlands, a 15N-HSQC-NOESY in H2O with a 150-ms mixing time and a 13C-HSQC-NOESY in D2O with a 200-ms mixing time and a 13C-HSQC-NOESY in the 13C aromatic region with a 200-ms mixing time, all three recorded on a local 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance TXI cryoprobe). ϕ torsion angle values were deduced from the analysis of the Hn-Ha and HMQC-J experiments (23Vuister G.W.

NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Hydrogen-bound restraints were derived from slowly exchanging amide protons, identified by measuring the amide proton exchange rates from 1H-15N HSQC spectra recorded at different times on a protein sample dissolved in D2O. All spectra were processed with the programs Xwinnmr (Bruker) or NMRPipe (25Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11375) Google Scholar) and analyzed using Felix (Accelrys).Solution Structure Determination—We solved the three-dimensional solution structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of MAN1CA using heteronuclear double and triple resonance NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling. Coordinates and NMR restraints were deposited at the Protein Data Bank. The solution structure was calculated on the basis of the analysis of 3581 nuclear Overhauser effect cross-peaks (765 were picked on the 15N-HSQC-NOESY 600 MHz, 756 on the 15N-HSQC-NOESY 900 MHz, 1241 on the 13C-HSQC-NOESY 900 MHz, 763 on the 13C-HSQC-NOESY 600 MHz, and 56 on the 13C-HSQC-NOESY aromatic 600 MHz, respectively). A semiautomated iterative assignment procedure was applied for the assignment and the construction of the three-dimensional structures (26Savarin P. Zinn-Justin S. Gilquin B. J. Biomol.

Thus, the mean number of distance restraints/residue yields 19.2 for the segment Arg-6 to Ile-111. Furthermore, 169 couples of (ϕ, Ψ) torsion angles were derived either from the backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shifts using the program TALOS (28Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar) or from the Hn-Ha and HMQC-J data. Finally, 8 hydrogen bonds were imposed during the structure calculation. At the last step, 1000 structures were calculated and the 20 best structures were selected and refined with a standard energy function (CHARMM22), including an electrostatic energy term. This term was calculated with no net charge on the side-chain atoms and with a distance-gated dielectric constant. Analysis of the 20 final structures showed that no distance violations larger than 0.5 Å were present and that the covalent geometry was respected. The r.m.s.d. around the average structure was 1.0 Å for the backbone and 1.6 Å for the heavy atoms.DNA Preparation—The 211-base pair DNA fragment was generated by polymerase chain reaction with a thermostable DNA polymerase (Promega) using a PTC-100 PCR System (MJ Research, Inc.). The 211-base pair DNA fragment, obtained from the DraI and BamHI double digest of the plasmid pUC(357.4), was used as template and the 5′-AAATAGCTTAACTTTCATCAAGCAAG-3′ and 5′-CCCGGGCGAGCTCGAATTCC-3′ oligonucleotides as sense and antisense primers. 5′-end labeling with [32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase was performed according to standard protocols (20Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 1989; (65, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 10.10-10.60Google Scholar).Protein-DNA Interactions—Proteins were diluted to the concentrations indicated in the Fig. 5 legend in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. They were incubated with the radioactive 211-base pair DNA fragment for 3 h at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide gels at an acrylamide to bis-acrylamide ratio of 29/1 (w/w) in 12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 95 mm glycine, and 0.5 mm EDTA. After 1 h of pre-electrophoresis, samples were loaded onto the gels and resolved by electrophoresis at 70 V for 2 h. DNA was detected by auto-radiography of dried polyacrylamide gels at -80 °C using Biomax MR films (Kodak) and an intensifying screen. For affinity measurements, dried polyacrylamide gels were exposed to a phosphor screen, and measurements of the radioactive signals were performed with a STORM 860 scanner (Amersham Biosciences) using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare).Molecular Modeling of the MAN1 Winged Helix-DNA Complex— The winged helix domain of MAN1 was superimposed onto the winged helix domain of MecI-DNA complex using the program Sybyl 6.9. The superimposition was done by fitting the Cα atoms of the following segments 6-23, 24-25, 26-37, 38-53, 60-64, and 65-68 of MecI on 15-32, 44-45, 46-57, 60-75, 82-86, and 93-96 of MAN1CA (resulting r.m.s.d. 3.4 Å). These segments correspond to the secondary elements of the winged helix motif. Then, in the MecI-DNA complex, the winged helix domain of MecI was replaced by the corresponding domain of MAN1. To remove the small number of steric clashes, 1000 steps of steepest descents energy minimization were run using the program CHARMM (29Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13837) Google Scholar). Side-chain conformations were allowed to vary only on the MAN1 winged helix domain, keeping the entire DNA fixed and maintaining the MAN1 winged helix domain backbone by progressively decreasing harmonics constraints. A MAN1 winged helix-DNA complex model with no bad clashes and reasonable interaction energy was thus obtained.RESULTSThe MAN1 Carboxyl-terminal Nucleoplasmic Region Contains a Well Structured Domain—The carboxyl-terminal nucleoplasmic region of MAN1, comprising residues 655-910, exhibits two potential globular domains. The region from amino acid 655 to 758 is conserved in all MAN1 analogs (called MAN1 and LEM2 proteins) (30Brachner A. Reipert S. Foisner R. Gotzmann J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5797-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and shows globular domain sequence characteristics (31Mans B.J. Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1612-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar); the region between amino acids 785 and 910 is found only in MAN1 proteins and shows an unusual RRM motif called UHM, predicted to adopt an α/β fold and to be involved in protein recognition (19Kielkopf C.L. Lucke S. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1513-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We have recorded the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of MAN1CA (aminos acid 655-775 of MAN1) and MAN1CB (amino acids 658-910), corresponding to the first predicted globular domain and the entire carboxyl-terminal nucleoplasmic region of MAN1, respectively. The spectrum of MAN1CA is well dispersed, confirming that the region from amino acid 655 to 775 adopts a globular structure in solution. Superposition of MAN1CA and MAN1CB spectra shows that all peaks of MAN1CA are found at identical chemical shifts in MAN1CB spectrum (Fig. 1). This suggests that the three-dimensional structure of MAN1CA is not affected by the presence of the putative UHM domain. Furthermore, only ∼40 additional peaks are found on the MAN1CB spectrum compared with the MAN1CA spectrum. These peaks are mostly clustered between 7.5 and 8.5 ppm in the proton dimension. This is not consistent with the presence of a well structured α/β UHM domain. A slow proteolysis of MAN1CB is observed at 300 K, and analysis of the resulting peptides by SDS-PAGE and amino-terminal sequencing revealed that only MAN1CA is resistant to proteolysis. Finally, expression in E. coli of the second putative domain alone (amino acid 776-910) yielded a rapidly aggregating protein. All these data suggest that only the first globular domain adopts a stable three-dimensional structure on the NMR time scale (millisecond).FIGURE 1Superimposition of 1H-15N HSQC spectra of MAN1CA and MAN1CB. Overlay of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra obtained at 300 K for MAN1CA (blue) and for MAN1CB (red).

In the following, residues belonging to this fragment are numbered from 6 to 126 (residues 1-5 and 127-133 are additional amino acids linked to the plasmid construction). Backbone and side-chain 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments were performed from residue 6 to 112 (22Caputo S. Lin F. Gilquin B. Worman H.J. Zinn-Justin S. Couprie J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Next, molecular modeling calculations were carried out to obtain a structure consistent with the 1811 NOESY-derived proton-proton distances and the 169 dihedral angle values deduced from TALOS (Table 1). The region between residues 17 and 101 (amino acids 666-750, using the MAN1 numbering) adopts a well defined α/β fold. The backbone r.m.s.d. calculated on this fragment with respect to the mean coordinate yields 1.0 Å. The three-dimensional structure of the region between residues 17 and 101 is constituted of three α-helices, H1 (residues 17-37), H2 (residues 47-54), and H3 (residues 58-76), and three β-strands, S1 (residues 44-46), S2 (residues 81-88), and S3 (residues 92-99), organized into a H1-S1-H2-H3-S2-S3 topology (Fig. 2). Thus, the amino-terminal half of the domain is mainly α-helical, whereas the carboxyl-terminal half is composed of two large β-strands arranged in a twisted anti-parallel β-sheet.TABLE 1Structural statistics for the human MAN1 655–775 fragment The van der Waals energy is calculated with a Lennard-Jones potential.

They are amphipathic, and their hydrophobic core is constituted by Met-20, Val-21, Ile-24, Ile-25, Val-27, and Leu-28 (H1), Val-50, Leu-54 (H2), and Trp-67, Ala-70, Val-71, Leu-74 (H3). The three-stranded β-sheet is packed onto the three-helix bundle. The α/β interface is mainly hydrophobic. It is constituted by Leu-28 (H1), Ile-47 and Val-50 (H2), Trp-67 and Val-71 (H3), which contact the hydrophobic face of the three-stranded β-sheet composed of Met-45 (S1), Val-81 (S2), and Trp-96, Trp-98 (S3). This interface also involves a hydrogen bond network between the backbone of Leu-28 (H1), the side chain of Asn-32 (H1), the side chain of Trp-98 (S3), and the backbone of Arg-80 (S2).The α/β Structure of MAN1 Corresponds to a Winged Helix Domain—The three-dimensional structure of the fragment between residues 17 and 101 of MAN1CA was submitted to the DALI server. Its structure is close to the three-dimensional structure of numerous proteins belonging to the winged helix superfamily as defined by SCOP. Winged helix domains are mainly used for DNA recognition (32Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The winged helix domain of MAN1 is structurally similar to several DNA binding domains belonging to transcription factors (PDB code 1OKR, Z-score 4.0, sequence identity 5%, Fig. 3A; 1P4X, Z-score 3.8, sequence identity 9%) and to histone H5 (1HST, Z-score 3.5, sequence identity 9%). However, recently winged helix domains were also described as protein-RNA (19Kielkopf C.L. Lucke S. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1513-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 33Dong G.

The MAN1 winged helix domain is also structurally similar to a protein-protein interaction module belonging to the ESCTR-II endosomal trafficking complex (1U5T; Z-score 4.0, sequence identity 5%, Fig. 3B). In this structure, contacts between different winged helices are mediated on one side by the concave surface formed by helices H2, H3, and β-sheet S2-S3 and on the other side by the loop connecting H3 to S2.FIGURE 3Superimposition of the WH domain of MAN1 (α-helices in blue and β-strands in yellow) with those of a domain of the bacterial transcriptional repressor MecI (A) (PDB code 1OKR, α-helices in cyan and β-strands in red) and a module of the ESCTR-II endosomal trafficking complex (B) (PDB code 1U5T, α-helices in cyan and β-strands in red).View Large Image Figure"

Science. 1994; 264: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (3474) Google Scholar), and a large amount of research suggests that this toxic property is an increased propensity for the pathogenic SOD1 to aggregate relative to the wild-type (WT) protein (5Johnston J.A.

Yet, as is the case with proteins that cause other familial protein aggregation diseases, this increased aggregation propensity cannot be explained solely by the global stability of the ALS mutant SOD1 proteins (9DuBay K.F.

Although it is true that the A4V substitution, one of the most frequently occurring mutations in SOD1-related familial ALS, results in a significantly destabilized SOD1 protein and causes an especially severe form of the disease (12Rosen D.R.

Dobson C.M.

In many proteins this local unfolding can be identified by the rate and mechanism of solvent exchange at the backbone amide hydrogen, as was observed with mass spectrometry for hematopoietic cell kinase (17Engen J.R.

We report here the results of studies using HX-MS to study the structure and dynamics of the pathogenic A4V variant of SOD1 in both the apoSOD1S-S and apoSOD12SH states. In accordance with our previous work, we are interested in studying the ALS-linked SOD1 apoproteins with and without the intramolecular disulfide bond. These two demetallated forms of the polypeptide may be particularly relevant to ALS because they represent the most destabilized form of the protein (the Tm of Cu2Zn2 SOD1 is >90 °C), and demetallation may be necessary before aggregation occurs (29DiDonato M.

We have found that the A4V mutation causes perturbations to apoSOD1S-S that are far from the Val-4 substitution, particularly at residues 50-53, whereas many other regions of the A4V variant, such as β1 and the Greek-key loop VI are unaffected by the mutation, as measured by HX-MS. Additionally, the A4V mutation promotes the formation of an intermediate apoSOD1S-S species that is locally unfolded at residues 21-53. We also report that at 20 °C, A4V apoSOD12SH undergoes rapid exchange similar to a completely disordered polypeptide but begins to populate folded states at 4 °C. WT and A4V apoSOD1S-S Proteins—Recombinant human WT and A4V SOD1 were purified from yeast, demetallated, and analyzed with inductively coupled plasma-emission spectroscopy as previously described (30Lyons T.J.

ApoSOD1 proteins contained <0.09 eq of either copper or zinc per dimer. Aliquots of apoSOD1S-S (80 μm) were prepared, flash-frozen in N2 (liquid) and stored at -70 °C. Mass spectral analysis of each protein confirmed >95% purity, with experimental molecular masses of 15872.92 and 15844.60 Da for A4V and WT apoSOD1, respectively (see the supplemental data). For each day of experiments, a fresh aliquot of SOD1 protein was thawed and kept on ice. All buffers and protein solutions were prepared using deionized water passed through a Millipore® ultrapurification system. Deuterium Exchange—Because the unstable A4V apoSOD1 protein readily aggregates at room temperature after extended time periods (hours), we chose to conduct site-specific HX-MS experiments at 4 °C. 10 mm deuterated phosphate buffer (pD 7.4) was prepared by SpeedVac evaporation of H2O from multiple 500-μl aliquots of 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) in microcentrifuge tubes. D2O (500 μl; 99.9% D, Sigma-Aldrich®) was then added back to each dry tube. This process was repeated two additional times. Aliquots of deuterated phosphate buffer were sealed with Parafilm and stored at -20 °C; a fresh aliquot was thawed and used for each day of experiments. Before H/D exchange and mass spectrometry, apoSOD1 samples were transferred to a low salt buffer (10 mm phosphate (pH 7.4)) and concentrated to 800 μm using Microcon® centrifugal filtration devices (molecular weight cutoff, 10 kDa., Millipore®). Concentrated apoSOD1 samples and deuterated buffer were then equilibrated at 4 °C in thin-walled PCR tubes using a Minicycler PCR machine (MJ Research). H/D exchange was initiated by diluting concentrated apoSOD1 samples 1:10 (v/v) into deuterated phosphate buffer at 4 °C. Isotopic exchange was quenched at time points varying from 0.25 to 325 min by the addition of a low pH pepsin solution (see below). Identical experiments were also conducted with protic buffer to provide a zero time point. ApoSOD1S-S Proteolysis and Electrospray Ionization-LC/MS—Lyophilized pepsin (Sigma-Aldrich®) was weighed and dissolved (5 mg/ml) into low pH buffer (100 mm phosphate, pH 2.5). Fresh aliquots of pepsin solutions were flash-frozen in N2 (liquid) and stored at -70 °C. A few minutes before each proteolysis, a pepsin aliquot was thawed and kept on ice. H/D exchange was quenched, and proteolysis was initiated at various time points by the addition of 40 μl of low pH pepsin (0 °C) solution and 7 μl of a solution containing 500 mm TCEP (Tris-2-carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride; 0 °C) to 20 μl of apoSOD1S-S-deuterated samples (pepsin:SOD1 ∼ 2:1). After 10 min of proteolysis, 20 μl of this solution was injected into the low temperature liquid chromatography apparatus coupled to the electrospray ionization-MS using an ice-chilled, gas-tight syringe. The low temperature HPLC apparatus consisted of a Rheodyne injector (20-μl injection loop) and HPLC reverse phase column (Thermo-electron Bio-Basic 8, 50 × 1 mm, 5-μm particle size) packed in ice and insulated with a foam box. A precolumn micro-filter (Upchurch Scientific) containing a 0.5-μm frit was placed in-line between the injector and column. A fused silica line led from the column outlet directly to the electrospray source. HPLC pumps (Applied Biosystems 120A), which were at room temperature, were connected to the Rheodyne injector with PEEK (polyetherether ketone) tubing. All H/D exchange mass measurements were made using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Sciex® (Thornhill, Canada) API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with a scanning range of 350-1800 m/z. Reverse phase separation of peptides was done with an increasing, nonlinear gradient of acetonitrile in water (2-18% in 1 min, 18-25% in 8 min, 25-29% in 2 min, 29-60% in 1 min) both containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, with a flow rate of 80 μl/min. Calculation of molecular masses from at least 2 charge states and deconvolution of the ion series into a molecular mass spectrum was achieved with MacSpec® software (Version 3.3). Back-exchange and In-exchange Determination—Although low pH (2.5) and low temperature (0 °C) quenches H/D exchange by ∼5 orders of magnitude (32Smith D.L. Deng Y. Zhang Z. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 33Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar), there is still slow back-exchange of amide deuterons with solvent protons during proteolysis and LC-MS. To measure and correct for this deuterium loss, the mass of peptides from completely deuterated SOD1 were measured and compared with the theoretical masses of completely deuterated peptides in 90% D2O. Completely deuterated SOD1 peptides were prepared by heating A4V and WT apoSOD1S-S at 70 °C (well above the Tm value (13Rodriguez J.A. Shaw B.F. Durazo A. Sohn S.H. Doucette P.A. Nersissian A.M.

Quenching, proteolysis, and mass measurements were carried out as described above. From this mass, the maximum number of exchangeable protons in WT or mutant SOD1 peptides was determined. To determine the amount of deuterium that is incorporated into A4V and WT SOD1 during the 10-min proteolysis (referred to as in-exchange), identical proteolysis experiments were performed with concentrated SOD1 proteins in protic buffer, and upon mixing with low pH pepsin solution, an appropriate volume of D2O was added immediately to the digest. An average in-exchange value of ∼7% was determined, and in-exchange contributions were ignored during data analysis. Peptide Sequencing—Peptides that were generated from the proteolysis of SOD1 were sequenced by reverse-phase liquid chromatography and information-dependent acquisition tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a Thermo-Finnigan LCQ ion-trap mass spectrometer. Similar reverse phase separation and acetonitrile/water gradients were used for peptide separation. The fragmentation patterns were analyzed with Sequest® software. Peptide identities that possessed cross-correlation values above 3.0 were considered reliable. Kinetic Analysis of Deuterium Exchange—Deuterium incorporation was plotted as a function of time using Sigmaplot 9.0 (see Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 5). The value of unexchanged protons for each peptide was calculated as the difference between the measured mass of partially deuterated SOD1 peptides at various time points (MD,t) and the mass of the same SOD1 peptides that were completely deuterated (MD,∞).FIGURE 2A-B, H/D exchange profiles for the peptides 102-109 (A) and 104-116 (B) from WT and A4V apoSOD1S-S.

The presence of the slow exchanging amide hydrogen atoms proved troublesome in the curve fitting. To make the fittings converge, an artificial “infinity” time and mass point (t = 43,200 min, mass = MD,∞) was added to each data set. For peptides that exchanged completely within the 325 min range, the sum of two exponentials of the following form was fit to that data set, with variables similar to above. MD,t=MD,∞−Ae−k1t−Be−k2t The theoretical kinetic profiles representing the intrinsic H/D exchange rate for intact SOD1 and SOD1 peptides were calculated according to Bai et al. (33Bai Y. Milne J.S.

Intramolecular Disulfide Reduction and Global H/D Exchange of ApoSOD12SH—Global H/D exchange experiments at 20 °C and 4 °C (pD 7.4) on the disulfide intact and disulfide broken form of WT and A4V apoSOD1 were carried out as previously described, as was disulfide reduction of apoSOD1S-S in 100 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol (pH 5.5, 4 °C, 24 h) (13Rodriguez J.A.

ApoSOD1S-S Proteolysis—The complete proteolysis of apoSOD1S-S required 10 min (pepsin:SOD1 ∼ 2:1 per SOD1 dimer), as measured by the absence of multiply charged ions corresponding to the mass of full-length SOD1. The peptides that were identified with LC-MS/MS to be products of SOD1 proteolysis are listed in Table 1. The proteolysis pattern of A4V was identical to WT SOD1; these peptides represent 60% of the SOD1 amino acid sequence. The time required for complete SOD1 proteolysis (10 min) and LC separation of peptides (<10 min), allowed all peptides to be separated and measured by the mass spectrometer in <20 min after the quenching of H/D exchange and the beginning of proteolysis. The values for the amide deuteron back-exchange that occurred during this time period are listed in Table 1 and calculated as the difference between the experimental mass of completely deuterated peptides and the theoretical mass of completely deuterated peptides in 90% D2O; these values ranged from 17 to 34% with an average of 24%.TABLE 1Least squares fitted parameters for backbone amide H/D exchange of peptides from WT and A4V apo-SOD1S-S (4 °C, pD 7.4) MH refers to the mass of peptides derived from SOD1 in H2O, MD,325 refers to the mass of peptide derived from SOD1 after 325 min of exposure to D2O, and MD,∞ refers to the peptide mass from fully exchanged SOD1; S.D. values are in parentheses.

However, two peptides comprising residues 7-20 and 9-20 co-eluted in LC-MS and were identified with LC-MS/MS (Table 1, Fig. 1). Residues 7 and 8 are located in the same β-strand as alanine and valine 4 (β1), and residues 9-20 include loop I and β2. The deuterium incorporation of residues 7-20 and 9-20 for A4V and WT are shown in Fig. 1, A-B. The kinetic profiles showing the decreasing level of unexchanged protons for A4V (filled circle) and WT (open circle) apoSOD1S-S are superimposable and yield similar kinetic parameters (Fig. 1, Table 1), suggesting that the backbone of residues 7-20 is not altered in A4V apoSOD1S-S. The Δm/z of the doubly charged ions of peptide 7-20 (denoted [MH2]2+ or (7-20)2+) from A4V (red) and WT (blue) are shown in Fig. 1C, with the bottom plot representing the fully deuterated peptide, derived from SOD1 that was heated at 70 °C before proteolysis.

To study the importance of bromodomains in these complexes, we have compared the chromatin-remodeling and octamer-transfer activity of the SWI/SNF complex to a mutant complex that lacks the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain. Here we show that the SWI/SNF complex can remodel or transfer SAGA-acetylated nucleosomes more efficiently than the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain-deleted complex. These results demonstrate that the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain is important for the remodeling as well as for the octamer-transfer activity of the complex on H3-acetylated nucleosomes. Moreover, we show that, although the wild-type SWI/SNF complex displaces SAGA that is bound to acetylated nucleosomes, the bromodomain mutant SWI/SNF complex is less efficient in SAGA displacement. Thus, the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain is required for the full functional activity of SWI/SNF on acetylated nucleosomes and is important for the displacement of SAGA from acetylated promoter nucleosomes.

More recently we have shown that the Swi2/Snf2 and Gcn5 bromodomains play important roles in the anchoring of the SWI/SNF and SAGA complexes to acetylated promoters, respectively (40Hassan A.H. Prochasson P. Neely K.E. Galasinski S.C. Chandy M. Carrozza M.J. Workman J.L. Cell. 2002; 111: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). When SWI/SNF is recruited to immobilized nucleosomal templates, the retention of SWI/SNF requires both acetylated histones and the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain. In other words, deletion of the Swi2/Snf2 or Gcn5 bromodomains results in the dissociation of the modifying complex from acetylated nucleosome arrays upon activator removal. Consistent with these in vitro experiments, the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain was found to be required for SWI/SNF presence at the SUC2 promoter in vivo (40Hassan A.H. Prochasson P. Neely K.E. Galasinski S.C. Chandy M. Carrozza M.J. Workman J.L. Cell. 2002; 111: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutant phenotypes were uncovered for a swi2/snf2 bromodomain deletion when combined with mutations in the SAGA HAT complex, consistent with previous studies that showed redundant roles for the SWI/SNF and SAGA in vivo (40Hassan A.H.

In addition to the involvement of bromodomains in gene activation, other studies show their role in anti-silencing of genes at heterochromatin boundaries (41Ladurner A.G. Inouye C. Jain R. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 42Jambunathan N. Martinez A.W. Robert E.C. Agochukwu N.B. Ibos M.E. Dugas S.L. Donze D. Genetics. 2005; 171: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, it has recently been demonstrated that bromodomain proteins also show selective recognition of acetylated histones in vivo (43Kanno T. Kanno Y. Siegel R.M. Jang M.K. Lenardo M.J. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The stable association of SWI/SNF or SAGA on acetylated nucleosomes provides evidence of the importance of bromodomains and links chromatin-modifying complexes together to regulate gene expression. Recognition of the “histone code” by various domains (such as the bromodomain) in regulatory proteins helps the recruitment and binding of the modifying complexes to the post-translationally modified histones. Thus, the fact, that bromodomains within the catalytic subunit of chromatin-modifying complexes support their binding to acetylated promoter nucleosomes, suggests possible involvement of these bromodomains in targeting, retention, and action of these complexes on acetylated nucleosomal templates. To determine the role of the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain in the function of the SWI/SNF complex, we have purified a SWI/SNF complex lacking the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain and tested its functional activity comparing it to that of the wild-type complex. In this study, we show that the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain is necessary for the functional activity of the complex on acetylated nucleosomal templates. Although the lack of the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain has no effect on the remodeling as well as octamer-transfer activity of unmodified nucleosomes, the bromodomain-deleted (Δbromodomain) SWI/SNF cannot remodel or transfer SAGA-acetylated nucleosomes as efficiently as the wild type. These results demonstrate the requirement of the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain for the remodeling and octamer transfer activities of the complex on acetylated nucleosomes. Moreover, we show that the SAGA complex bound to the acetylated templates is destabilized and replaced by the SWI/SNF complex to remodel the acetylated nucleosomes. This displacement of SAGA by the SWI/SNF complex on acetylated nucleosomes requires the presence of the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain. These data illustrate a novel and significant role of the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain in remodeling of acetylated promoter nucleosomes and in displacing SAGA from promoters. Purification of the SWI/SNF and SAGA Complexes—The wild-type and the bromodomain deletion SWI/SNF complexes and the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex were purified from yeast whole cell extract by tandem affinity purification (TAP) over two affinity columns as described previously (44Rigaut G.

Briefly, whole cell extracts were prepared from six liters of yeast cells grown in YPD media and added to IgG resin (Amersham Biosciences). The complexes were eluted from the beads by TEV Protease (Invitrogen) cleavage in a buffer containing (10 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 m EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm dithiothreitol]. Following binding to calmodulin resin (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), the complexes were eluted using a buffer containing (10 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgAc, 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Purification was monitored by Western blot, using several antibodies as well as silver staining. The Snf6TAP-tag strain was generated by M. Carroza (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health) and the Spt7 TAP-tag strain was a gift from F. Winston (Dept. of Genetics, Harvard Medical School) (FY2021) (48Wu P.Y. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5367-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The endogenous Δbromodomain Swi2/Snf2, Snf6-TAP strain was generated using the Cre-Lox recombination system. Restriction Enzyme Accessibility Assay—The single Gal4-site probe (GUB) was generated by PCR as described (49Juan L.J. Utley R.T. Adams C.C. Vettese-Dadey M. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6031-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and used as naked DNA or a reconstituted mononucleosome in this assay as described before (21Prochasson P. Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Li B. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 983-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Wild-type or Δbromodomain mutant SWI/SNF was added to ∼10 ng of this 32P-labeled GUB template in a binding buffer that contains (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm MgCl2) in the presence or absence of 2 mm ATP. After incubation for 1 h at 30 °C, the binding reactions were then treated with 10 units of SalI for 30 min at 30 °C. An equal volume of stop buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K, 1 mg/ml glycogen) was added to the reactions, and incubated at 50 °C for 1 h. Deproteinized samples were precipitated with 200 mm NaCl and 3 volumes of ethanol, and the pellet was resuspended in 5 μl of the formamide dye (95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). After heat denaturation, the samples were resolved on a 6% acrylamide (19:1 acrylamide to bisacrylamide), 8 m urea sequencing gel at 150 volts for 3 h, and then visualized by autoradiography or exposed to a phosphorimaging device and quantified. In Fig. 3, the 32P-labeled GUB mononucleosome templates were first acetylated by SAGA for 30 min at 30 °C, prior to incubation with the SWI/SNF complexes. In Fig. 5, the GUB nucleosome templates were 32P-labeled on one end and biotinylated on the other. After acetylating the template with SAGA as before, the HAT complex was removed by the addition of 1 μg of competitor chromatin and washed to remove SAGA and the competitor, followed by the addition of the SWI/SNF remodeling complexes and SalI digestion as before.FIGURE 5The Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain deletion SWI/SNF complex has reduced remodeling and octamer-transfer activity on acetylated nucleosomes after dissociation of SAGA. A, diagram of the restriction enzyme accessibility assay. The experiment is similar to that in Fig. 3B, except the GUB nucleosome template was 32P-labeled on one end and biotinylated on the other. After acetylating the template with SAGA, the HAT complex was removed by the addition of 1 μg of competitor chromatin and washed to remove SAGA and the competitor, followed by the addition of the wild-type or the mutant SWI/SNF-remodeling complexes and SalI digestion as before. B, restriction enzyme accessibility assay shows reduced activity of Δbromodomain SWI/SNF complex on acetylated nucleosomes after SAGA removal. Briefly, the double 32P and biotin-labeled GUB fragment was reconstituted into mononucleosomes and then acetylated by SAGA. Following SAGA removal by the addition of competitor chromatin and washes, an equal amount of the wild-type and Δbromodomain SWI/SNF was added as in Fig. 3B. The rest of the reaction is the same as before with the final resolving of the DNA fragments on a 6% acrylamide-8 m urea sequencing gel at 150 volts for 3 h. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. C, diagram of octamer-transfer assay. The assay is similar to the one in Fig. 4 (C and D) except that biotinylated GUB template reconstituted into mononucleosomes was first acetylated by SAGA at 30 °C for 1 h. This was used as a donor of histones in this experiment, after washing SAGA away like before. Following the addition of the 32P-labeled GUB DNA template and either SWI/SNF wild-type or the mutant complex, the reactions were resolved on a 4% acrylamide native gel at 150 volts for 3 h. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography as before. D, octamer-transfer assay shows reduced transfer ability of the Δbromodomain SWI/SNF of SAGA-acetylated nucleosomes compared with the wild-type complex after SAGA removal. SAGA-acetylated donor nucleosomes that were incubated with competitor and washed to remove SAGA were added to 32P-labeled GUB DNA and SWI/SNF complexes (wild-type and the mutant) and ATP followed by analysis on the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Octamer Transfer Assay—The same template (GUB) utilized for the restriction enzyme accessibility assay was used in this assay. The reaction conditions for this octamer-transfer assay were the same as the SalI digestion assay described above. Briefly, 10 ng of the 32P-labeled GUB, naked DNA template, which was used as an octamer acceptor in this assay, was incubated with ∼10 ng of donor short oligonucleosomes (SONs) in the presence of wild-type or Δbromodomain mutant SWI/SNF and ATP for 2 h at 30 °C in the same binding buffer as before. 0.2 μg of competitor chromatin was added to the reaction to release any bound SWI/SNF complex from the template prior to resolving the binding reactions on a 4% acrylamide (79:1 acrylamide to bisacrylamide ratio) native gel at 150 volts for 2 h. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. In Fig. 4 (C and D), the donor nucleosomes are first acetylated with SAGA prior to the addition of the SWI/SNF complexes. Immobilized Template Octamer Transfer Assays—The immobilized template octamer-transfer assay is similar to the 32P-labeled GUB octamer-transfer assay described above, except the GUB template was biotinylated here and used as the octamer acceptor. Briefly, the GUB fragment was generated as before using a biotinylated 5′ primer in the PCR reaction. The biotinylated GUB templates were then bound to paramagnetic beads coupled to streptavidin (Dynabeads, Dynal) as described earlier (24Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L.

Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 536-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The donor SON nucleosomes were first acetylated with SAGA for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of [3H]acetyl-CoA (Amersham Biosciences) as described before by Eberharter et al. (51Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Methods. 1998; 15: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in the same binding buffer as above. SAGA-acetylated donor nucleosomes were incubated with the biotinylated streptavidin-coupled GUB DNA in the presence or absence of wild-type or mutant SWI/SNF and ATP for 1 h at 30 °C. The biotinylated nucleosome templates were then concentrated on a magnet, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed twice in the binding buffer. Acetylated histones on the GUB template were then either 1) eluted by boiling the beads in sample loading buffer, visualized by fluorography after running them on 15% SDS-PAGE gels, and exposed to film (Fig. 4B, top) or 2) bound to filter, washed, and counted in the scintillation counter (Fig. 4B, bottom). In Fig. 5, biotinylated GUB template reconstituted into mononucleosomes and acetylated by SAGA at 30 °C for 1 h was used as the donor of histones, after removing SAGA as above (with the addition of 1 μg of competitor chromatin and several washes). Following the addition of the 32P-labeled GUB DNA template and the SWI/SNF complexes, the experiment was continued as in Fig. 4 (C and D). Immobilized Template Displacement/Competition Assays—This displacement/competition assay utilizes the same biotinylated streptavidin-bound GUB template used above. Briefly, the immobilized GUB DNA was first reconstituted into mononucleosomes, followed by incubation with SAGA in the presence or absence of cold acetyl-CoA for 30 min at 30 °C. After incubation with ATP and either the wild-type or the mutant SWI/SNF complex for 1 h at 30 °C, the supernatants were separated from the beads, and the beads were washed and resolved on a 12% SDS gel, followed by Western blot analysis as described before (24Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 50Carrozza M.J. Hassan A.H. Workman J.L.

The Swi2/Snf2 Bromodomain Is Not Required for Activity of the SWI/SNF Complex on Unmodified Nucleosomes—To directly test whether the bromodomain within the Swi2/Snf2 subunit of the SWI/SNF complex contributes to the functional activity of the complex on nucleosomes, we purified wild-type SWI/SNF as well as SWI/SNF from a strain lacking the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain and tested them in chromatin-remodeling and octamer-transfer assays. For all assays, we used wild-type and mutant SWI//SNF complex that has been highly purified over two affinity columns using the TAP method. The loss of the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain did not affect complex integrity as detected by silver staining (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2 and 3). The Swi2/Snf2, Swi3, and Swp61 antibodies were used to determine SWI/SNF protein levels by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). The same amounts of the wild-type and the Δbromodomain SWI/SNF complexes were used in all our assays based on this normalization of the amounts of purified protein. The activities of these two complexes were first compared on unmodified nucleosomes. The DNA templates used in Fig. 2 is the 183-bp “GUB” fragment generated by PCR using a radiolabeled 5′ primer and the pGALUSFBEND plasmid that we had previously used (14Neely K.E. Hassan A.H.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6031-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This DNA fragment was reconstituted into a nucleosome by salt dilution/octamer transfer and was used for the restriction enzyme accessibility assay. We analyzed the ability of the SalI restriction enzyme to digest its cutting site in about the middle of the 183-bp GUB nucleosomal DNA with the wild-type and the Δbromodomain SWI/SNF complexes in the presence or absence of ATP (Fig. 2A). Both the wild-type and the mutant complex increased the accessibility of the restriction enzyme to its site on the nucleosomal DNA in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–11). Moreover, the digestion of the DNA by the restriction enzyme was the same in the presence of either the wild-type or the mutant SWI/SNF complex on this unmodified GUB nucleosome (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 4–6 to 8–10). Quantification of this experiment showed that a similar percentage of the nucleosome template was cleaved in the presence of either of these complexes, indicating that the absence of the bromodomain in the Swi2/Snf2 subunit of the SWI/SNF complex did not affect its remodeling activity on these nucleosomes. Using the same two complexes in a different functional assay, we compared their ability to transfer octamers from SONs to a radiolabeled GUB, naked DNA fragment. The same GUB DNA fragment used in Fig. 2A was used here and served as an acceptor of histone octamers. As shown in Fig. 2B, both the wild-type and the bromodomain-deleted SWI/SNF complexes were able to transfer histone octamers from the donor SONs to the DNA template in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–6). Moreover, the amounts of the octamers transferred by the two complexes (wild-type and the mutant) were similar (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3–6). These data demonstrate that the Δbromodomain SWI/SNF complex has the same remodeling and histone octamer-transfer activity as the wild-type SWI/SNF complex. Thus, the deletion of the bromodomain neither affected complex stability nor reduced its remodeling activity. The Swi2/Snf2 Bromodomain Is Important for the Remodeling and Octamer Transfer Activities of the SWI/SNF Complex on SAGA-acetylated Nucleosomes—Previous observations have shown that acetylation of nucleosomes prior to addition of the SWI/SNF complex helps stabilize the binding of SWI/SNF to a nucleosome array template (24Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain was found to be important for this enhanced binding (40Hassan A.H. Prochasson P. Neely K.E. Galasinski S.C. Chandy M. Carrozza M.J. Workman J.L. Cell. 2002; 111: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). These data have led us to investigate the role of the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain in remodeling of acetylated nucleosomes. To test whether the bromodomain within the Swi2/Snf2 subunit of the SWI/SNF complex contributes to the remodeling activity of the complex on acetylated nucleosomes, we compared the activities of both the wild-type and the mutant SWI/SNF complex on templates that are acetylated with the SAGA HAT complex in the SalI restriction enzyme digestion assay. The outline of the experiment shows that the radiolabeled GUB template is incubated with the SAGA complex in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA, followed by the remodeling reaction and digestion by the restriction enzyme SalI (Fig. 3A), as before. Digestion of the naked DNA template by SalI is not affected by the presence of SAGA or acetylation by SAGA (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 2–4). Lanes 6 and 7 again show the equal remodeling activity of the two SWI/SNF complexes (wild-type and the mutant). No SalI digestion of the nucleosomal template was observed with the SAGA complex in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA (see lanes 8 and 9), confirming that the SAGA HAT complex has no chromatin-remodeling activity. When SAGA was added to the template in the absence of acetyl-CoA (lanes 10 and 11), the remodeling activity of the wild-type and mutant SWI/SNF complexes were the same, suggesting that the presence of the SAGA complex alone had no effect on the ac"

While the PI3K/Akt pathway has been shown to regulate multiple cellular events pertinent to AD pathogenesis, potential functions of tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) in AD pathogenesis have not been explored. Here, we examine the effects of PTEN on tau phosphorylation, its microtubule association and formation of aggregates, and consequentially neuronal morphology. In cultured cells, overexpression of wild-type (WT) PTEN alters tau phosphorylation at several sites, increases tau-microtubule association and decreases formation of tau aggregates. In addition, the phosphatase-null PTEN increases tau aggregation and impairs tau binding to microtubule and neurite outgrowth of neurons expressing the mutant PTEN. We also found a significant loss of PTEN in AD patient brains correlated with a dramatically increased concentration of phospho-tau at Ser-214 in NFTs. Together, our results demonstrate that PTEN regulates tau phosphorylation, binding to microtubules and formation of aggregates and neurite outgrowth. These findings suggest a link between malfunction of PTEN and tauopathy, and imply PTEN as a therapeutic target for tauopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2162373016,"The presenilin (PS)/gamma-secretase complex proteolytically cleaves more than 20 different proteins in addition to the amyloid precursor protein (APP). These substrates are almost exclusively type I membrane proteins. Many undergo internalization from the cell surface followed by degradation or recycling back to the plasma membrane through the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC). Evidence shows that the PSs also regulate intracellular trafficking of APP and its C-terminal fragments (CTFs). To investigate whether PS/gamma-secretase activity is required for normal endosomal recycling, we performed live cell imaging experiments with fluorescently labeled transferrin, reported to specifically traffic through the ERC. By using pharmacological gamma-secretase inhibitors or cell lines lacking functional PS/gamma-secretase, here we show that PS/gamma-secretase activity is required for clearance of transferrin from the ERC. Interestingly, lack of PS/gamma-secretase function also resulted in the accumulation of APP and APP-CTFs in the ERC in addition to the cell surface. Familial Alzheimer's disease mutations in APP-CTFs did not affect endocytic recycling of these proteins. Our results suggest that PS/gamma-secretase activity is required for normal endosomal recycling of soluble and membrane-associated proteins through the ERC and propose a new mechanism by which impaired PS/gamma-secretase function may eventually contribute to neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2045266866,"Abstract Lnk, with APS and SH2-B (Src homology 2-B), belongs to a family of SH2-containing proteins with potential adaptor functions. Lnk regulates growth factor and cytokine receptor-mediated pathways implicated in lymphoid, myeloid, and platelet homeostasis. We have previously shown that Lnk is expressed and up-regulated in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in response to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). In this study, we have shown that, in ECs, Lnk down-regulates the expression, at both mRNA and protein levels, of the proinflammatory molecules VCAM-1 and E-selectin induced by TNFα. Mechanistically, our data indicated that, in response to TNFα, NFκB/p65 phosphorylation and translocation as well as IκBα phosphorylation and degradation were unchanged, suggesting that Lnk does not modulate NFκB activity. However, Lnk activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) as reflected by Akt phosphorylation. Our results identify endothelial nitric-oxide synthase as a downstream target of Lnk-mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and HO-1 as a new substrate of Akt. We found that sustained Lnk-mediated activation of PI3K in TNFα-activated ECs correlated with the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) was unchanged. ERK1/2 inhibition decreases VCAM-1 expression in TNFα-treated ECs. Collectively, our results identify the adaptor Lnk as a negative regulator in the TNFα-signaling pathway mediating ERK inhibition and suggest a role for Lnk in the interplay between PI3K and ERK triggered by TNFα in ECs."

Here, we characterized cartilage versican during development and growth. Immunostaining showed that versican was mainly localized in the interterritorial zone of the articular surface at 2 weeks in mice, whereas aggrecan was in the pericellular zone of prehypertrophic and hypertrophic cells of the growth plate. Although its transcription level rapidly diminished during growth, versican remained in the articular cartilage. Biochemical analysis of normal articular cartilage and aggrecan-null cartilage from cmd (cartilage matrix deficiency)/cmd mice revealed that versican was present as a proteoglycan aggregate with both link protein and hyaluronan. Chondroitin sulfate chains of versican digested with chondroitinase ABC contained 71% nonsulfated and 28% 4-sulfated unsaturated disaccharides, whereas those of aggrecan contained 25% nonsulfated and 70% 4-sulfated. Link protein overexpression in chondrocytic N1511 cells at the early stage of differentiation, in which versican is expressed, enhanced versican deposition in the matrix and prevented subsequent aggrecan deposition.

In some adult tissues, such as the heart, blood vessels, and brain, it is constitutively expressed and serves as a structural macromolecule of the ECM. In developing cartilage, versican is transiently expressed at a high level in the mesenchymal condensation area and rapidly disappears during cartilage development (7Kimata K. Oike Y. Tani K.

Recent immunohistochemical studies on developing limb bud cartilage revealed that an area positive for versican gradually shifts out of the diaphysis and is replaced by an area positive for aggrecan. Differentiating chondrocytic N1511 and ATDC5 cells showed similar expression patterns of these molecules (9Kamiya N. Watanabe H. Habuchi H. Takagi H. Shinomura T. Shimizu K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2390-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These reciprocal patterns of versican and aggrecan expression suggest that versican serves as a temporary framework in developing cartilage matrix. Although the aggrecan aggregate (10Wight T.N. Heinegård D.K. Hascall V.C. Cell Biology of Extracelulat Matrix. 1991; (Plenum Press, New York): 45-78Crossref Google Scholar) is the major component of cartilage ECM and versican has not been detected by immunohistochemical studies (3Bode-Lesniewska B.

The core protein of versican consists of N- and C-terminal globular domains (G1 and G3) and two chondroitin sulfate (CS) domains (CS-α and CS-β). The N-terminal G1 comprises A, B, and B′ loops and binds to both hyaluronan (HA) (14Watanabe H. Cheung S.C. Itano N. Kimata K. Yamada Y. J. Biol.

Kitagawa Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27603-27609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As aggrecan in cartilage forms a proteoglycan aggregate with both HA and LP, versican is believed to form similar stable aggregates in the presence of both HA and LP. Indeed, versican aggregates have been isolated from dental pulp (8Shibata S. Fukada K. Imai H. Abe T. Yamashita Y. J. Anat. 2003; 203: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and versican secreted from cultured vascular smooth muscle cells forms aggregates with HA and LP (20Evanko S.P. Johnson P.Y. Braun K.R. Underhill C.B. Dudhia J. Wight T.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that the versican G1 domain binds to both LP and HA in a different manner than aggrecan G1 (21Matsumoto K. Shionyu M. Go M. Shimizu K. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Watanabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41205-41212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); the B-B′ segments of LP and versican G1 bind each other, whereas the A loops of LP and aggrecan G1 interact. These results suggest that versican is present as an aggregate in articular cartilage, with HA and LP, and plays a unique role distinct from the aggrecan aggregate. However, the versican aggregate has not been identified in cartilage, and the function of versican has not been determined. In this study, we investigated the expression, localization, and aggregate formation of versican in cartilage to gain insights into its function. Versican was mainly localized in the interterritorial zone of the articular surface, whereas aggrecan was rather diffused, especially with dense staining in the territorial zone of prehypertrophic chondrocytes. The versican aggregate was isolated by cesium chloride density gradient ultracentrifugation from normal articular and aggrecan-null cartilage. Although transcription of the versican gene dramatically decreased after birth, versican remained in the articular cartilage in the form of the proteoglycan aggregate. LP overexpression in chondrocytic N1511 cells, which synthesize versican at the early stage of differentiation, significantly enhanced versican deposition and inhibited subsequent aggrecan deposition. These results suggest that the versican aggregate is present in the articular surface and may provide ECM properties distinct from deeper zones where aggrecan aggregates are abundant. Immunostaining and Detection of HA by HABP in Tissues—Aggrecan-null cartilage matrix deficiency (cmd) lines (22Watanabe H. Kimata K. Line S. Strong D. Gao L.Y. Kozak C.A. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) were maintained in our animal facility. Mouse tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sliced into 4-μm sections. When necessary, hard tissues were decalcified with 0.5 m EDTA for 14 days. For immunostaining, tissue sections were pretreated with 1 unit/ml of proteasefree chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku Corp.) at 37 °C for 30 min. For aggrecan and versican, rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse aggrecan (a gift from Dr. T. Yada, ×500) and anti-mouse versican (anti-CS-α and anti-CS-β, gifts from Dr. T. Shinomura, ×500) were used, respectively. To recognize all three variant forms (V0, V1, and V2) of versican except for V3, which was not expressed as a protein, we used a mixture of anti-CS-α and anti-CS-β antibodies. Biotinylated HABP, ×100; Seikagaku) was used for HA detection. LP immunostaining was performed with mouse monoclonal anti-LP, which reacts with mouse LP (8A4, ×100; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) using HistoMouse™ SP kit (Zymed Laboratory Inc.). Identification of Proteoglycan Aggregates—Native versican was prepared from mouse brain as described previously (23Schmalfeldt M. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15758-15764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In a pilot test of density gradient ultracentrifugation, native versican, biotinylated LP, and HA were best separated at a density of 1.42 mg/ml of CsCl, when versican was fractionated into A1-A3. 220 mg (wet weight) of cmd/cmd cartilage was homogenized in 5 volumes of extraction buffer containing 0.5 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.36 mm pepstatin A. The homogenate was stirred overnight at 4 °C and clarified by centrifugation in capped polycarbonate tubes (15,000 × g 10 min, 4 °C). Solid CsCl was added to give an initial density of 1.42 g/ml, followed by further centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min, at 4 °C). After the centrifugation, a floating pellicle was removed, and the clarified solutions were centrifuged under an associative condition (0.4 m GdnHCl) in polyallomer tubes at 110,000 × g, 10 °C, for 96 h in a swing rotor. The solution in the tube was fractionated into six tubes, A1-A6, from the bottom. To identify these molecules individually, the tissue was extracted using 4 m GdnHCl, Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.36 mm pepstatin A, and the extract was applied to dissociative ultracentrifugation. These molecules were monitored by dot blot and immunoblot analyses. The density of bands and blots was quantified using NIH Image version 1.63. To detect the versican aggregate in articular cartilage, 2-week-old mouse femoral articular cartilage up to 1 mm in depth was carefully dissected and extracted as above, followed by ultracentrifugation at a density of 1.61 g/ml (first centrifugation). The solution was fractionated into 13 tubes, and fractions A9-11 containing versican were collected. The collected sample was ultracentrifuged at 1.61 g/ml again (second centrifugation), and fractions A9-11 were collected and ultracentrifuged again (third centrifugation) at 1.6 g/ml. Then fractions A9-11 containing versican were ultracentrifuged at 1.51 g/ml (fourth centrifugation). Versican, aggrecan, and LP were monitored as above. For quantification of versican and aggrecan in the articular surface area, the surface area at day 14 was carefully excised and extracted using ten volumes of 4 m GdnHCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.36 mm pepstatin A for 24 h. The second extraction was then performed using five volumes of the same buffer, which attained almost full extraction. The extract was applied to ELISA as below. Transfection and Immunostaining of N1511 Cells—N1511 cells were transfected and immunostained as previously described (24Kamiya N. Jikko A. Kimata K. Damsky C. Shimizu K. Watanabe H. J. Bone Miner Res. 2002; 17: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Biotinylated anti-FLAG M2 (×200) and anti-CS-β (×2,000) were used as primary antibodies, followed by treatment with streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (×1,000) for FLAG or Alexa fluor Texas red (×2,000) for anti-CS-β. Fluorescence was observed using an Olympus BX50 microscope. For HA detection, biotinylated HABP (×500) and streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (×1,000) were used in place of primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. N1511 cell culture plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml of pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml of leupeptin. After cell lysis, the remaining matrix was collected and used for immunoblot and dot blot. At day 13 after induction by 1 × 10-6 m dexamethasone (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and 1 × 10-7 m rat parathyroid hormone (Sigma), whole-mount cultures were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 10% formalin/phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, and then stained with 0.5% Alcian blue (pH 2.0) overnight. Versican was immunostained as above. The area stained with Alcian blue was measured using NIH Image version 1.63. Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR—To analyze aggrecan or versican transcription in cartilage, we obtained cartilage from C57/Bl6 mice at days 0 and 2 and at 8 weeks. Poly(A) RNA (200-600 ng) was prepared from cartilage using the Micro-Fast Track™ kit (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed to generate cDNA using the Superscript II First-Strand Synthesis™ system (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using TaqMan™ 7700 (PE Applied Biosystems). Sequences for a probe and a set of primers for versican were chosen by the Primer Express™ program as follows: probe, 5′-CACTCTAACCCTTGTCGGAATGGT-3′; forward primer, 5′-CCAGTGTGAACTTGATTTTGATGAA-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-AACATAACTTGGGAGACAGAGACATCT-3′. The sequences of the probe and primers for aggrecan were described previously (25Watanabe H. de Caestecker M.P. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14466-14473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The probe was labeled with fluorescent reporter dyes 6-carboxyfluorescein and 6-carboxy-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylrhodamine at 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. For the internal control, a set of primers and a probe of rodent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase labeled with VIC™ (PE Applied Biosystems) were used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—ELISA plates (MaxiSorp; Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of aggrecan (10 μg/ml; Seikagaku) or versican (5 μg/ml; Collaborative Biomedical Products) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl (Tris-buffered saline, TBS) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. An anti-aggrecan antibody (×250) or an anti-versican antibody (×250) in 50 ml of TBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin was mixed with the same sample volume at different dilutions in TBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing wells with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) three times, the mixture was applied to wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing wells with TBS-T three times, a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (×10,000; Cappel) was applied and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing wells five times with TBS-T, detection was performed with tetramethylbenzidine (SureBlue™ TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate; KPL). Analysis of CS Disaccharide Composition—Samples fractionated after density gradient ultracentrifugation were precipitated by the addition of 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate. The precipitate was dissolved in distilled water and then treated in 0.2 m NaOH for 24 h at room temperature, neutralized by the addition of 4 m acetate, and then digested with actinase E (Kaken Pharmaceutical) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 5 h at 50°C. The sample was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After washing with 10 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, GAG-rich fractions were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 m NaCl. The eluate was ethanol precipitated as above and dissolved in 200 μl of distilled water. The samples were treated with 30 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC in 25 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.04% bovine serum albumin for 4 h at 37°C and filtered with Ultrafree-MC (5,000 molecular weight limit; Millipore). Unsaturated disaccharides in the filtrates were analyzed by reverse phase ion-pair chromatography using Senshu Pak column Docosil with a fluorescence detector according to the method of Toyoda (26Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) with slight modification of elution conditions. Separately, we treated the above eluate with hyaluronidase from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus (Seikagaku), similarly filtered and analyzed, and confirmed that hyaluronan disaccharide was negligible in the samples. Distribution of Versican, HA, and LP in Cartilage—Initially, we investigated the presence and localization of versican, aggrecan, LP, and HA in the growth plate and articular cartilage of 2-week-old mice by immunostaining and with biotinylated hyaluronan-binding protein (biotinylated HABP). In the growth plate, versican was faintly stained in the interterritorial zone. LP was strongly stained in the pericellular zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes and moderately in the interterritorial zone. HA was diffusely localized with higher deposition in the pericellular zone. In contrast, aggrecan was stained mainly in the territorial zone of chondrocyte columns and the pericellular zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes (Fig. 1A). In the articular surface, versican, LP, HA, and aggrecan were observed in the interterritorial zone. Aggrecan was also localized in the pericellular zone of hypertrophic cells (Fig. 1B). Although the detailed localization of these molecules was different, the colocalization of versican, LP, and HA in the interterritorial zone of the articular surface suggests the presence of their aggregates. Versican Forms Proteoglycan Aggregates in Vivo—We then examined whether versican is present as a proteoglycan aggregate with HA and LP in cartilage. Because normal cartilage contains a large amount of aggrecan, which may inhibit the identification of versican aggregates, we first used cartilage from cmd/cmd mice (22Watanabe H. Kimata K. Line S. Strong D. Gao L.Y. Kozak C.A. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), a natural knock-out of the aggrecan gene. When the localization of the three molecules in cmd/cmd cartilage was examined, both versican and LP were observed mainly on the cartilage margin, whereas HA was diffuse (Fig. 2A), indicating the colocalization of the three molecules at least on the margin of cmd/cmd cartilage. To identify the proteoglycan aggregate, a sample was extracted from cmd/cmd cartilage by 0.5 m GdnHCl and applied to cesium chloride density gradient ultracentrifugation under an associative condition (0.4 m GdnHCl) (27Faltz L.L. Reddi A.H. Hascall G.K. Martin D. Pita J.C. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A major proportion of versican was observed in the A1-3 fractions, and a small proportion, presumably of processed fragments, was found in A6. The major proportion of both LP and HA was seen in A5-6, but some was observed in the A1-3 fractions (Fig. 2B, left). When the sample extracted by 4 m GdnHCl was ultracentrifuged under dissociative conditions (4 m GdnHCl), a major proportion of versican was observed in the D3 fraction. In contrast, the major proportions of both LP and HA were found in the D5-6 fractions (Fig. 2B, right). We confirmed the presence of versican and LP by immunoblot analyses. When the A1-3 and D1-3 fractions were treated with chondroitinase ABC and applied to immunoblot, the versican core protein was observed (Fig. 2C). LP was observed in the A1-3 fractions but not in D1-3. These data clearly indicate that cmd/cmd cartilage contains the proteoglycan aggregate of versican, LP, and HA. As the presence of versican aggregates in cmd/cmd may not necessarily indicate their presence in normal cartilage, we attempted to detect versican aggregates in normal cartilage. The surface area of articular cartilage at the age of 2 weeks was extracted under associative conditions and processed by cesium chloride density gradient ultracentrifugation at 1.61 g/ml. Although a large amount of aggrecan was present in A1-3 and A7-11, versican was mainly found in A9-11 (Fig. 3A). Repeated ultracentrifugation and collection of versican fractions as described under “Experimental Procedures” successfully removed aggrecan. Subsequent ultracentrifugation at 1.51 g/ml revealed the cofractionation of both versican and LP mainly in A4 (Fig. 3B), indicating the presence of versican aggregates in normal articular cartilage. Versican and Aggrecan Exhibit Different Sulfation Levels of CS Chains—As cartilage contains two types of proteoglycan aggregates, they may function by harboring different structures of CS chains. We performed disaccharide analysis of CS chains in aggrecan and versican. As both aggrecan-rich (A1-2 in Fig. 3A) and versican-rich (A4 in Fig. 3B) fractions obtained by repeated density gradient ultracentrifugation were confirmed as being >95% pure, respectively (data not shown), we used these fractions for disaccharide analysis. The GAG sample of the aggrecan-rich fraction treated with chondroitinase ABC contained ∼25% ΔdiS-0S and 70% ΔdiS-4S. In contrast, that of the similarly treated versican-rich fraction contained ∼71% ΔdiS-0S and 28% ΔdiS-4S. All other disaccharide structures such as ΔdiS-6S, ΔdiSD, ΔdiSE, and ΔdiTriS were negligible in both samples (Table 1). These results indicate that both are only sulfated at the 4-position of GalNAc and that sulfation levels of CS chains are higher in aggrecan than versican.TABLE 1CS disaccharide composition of versican and aggrecan ND, not determined.VersicanAggrecan%Δdi0S7125Δdi4S2870Δdi6SND1ΔdiSEND0.4ΔdiSDNDNDΔdiTriSND0.2 Open table in a new tab Expression Levels of Versican and Aggrecan in Cartilage—Next, we examined the transcription and protein levels of versican and aggrecan in differently aged mice. Real-time reverse transcription PCR indicated that the levels of versican transcription at 2 and 8 weeks after birth were ∼80 and 10%, respectively, that of newborn cartilage, whereas aggrecan transcription gradually increased and at 8 weeks reached 4 times that of the newborn cartilage (Fig. 4A). The amount of these proteoglycans was measured in cartilage at different ages by inhibition ELISA. Versican decreased at 2 weeks to ∼60% that of newborn cartilage and remained at 8 weeks, whereas the amount of aggrecan/wet weight gradually increased during growth (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that versican remains in the growing cartilage for at least 2-8 weeks after birth, although its transcription dramatically declines. The samples for quantification above included a mixture of articular and growth plate cartilage. In addition, the amount of these proteoglycans may be different between the surface and deep layers of articular cartilage. Thus we measured their amount in the surface layers (up to 1 mm in depth). Repeated extraction in 4 m GdnHCl confirmed almost full extraction. By inhibition ELISA, the surface area contained 41 and 88 μg/mg (wet weight) of versican and aggrecan, respectively. Interestingly, the extraction efficiency using 0.5 m GdnHCl was 23 and 61%, respectively, suggesting that versican with less CS chains is more tightly incorporated in the cartilage matrix of the articular surface layer. Deposition of Versican in the ECM Depends on the Expression of LP— Versican is transiently expressed at a high level in the mesenchymal condensation area. After the transcription level rapidly decreases, versican remains in the interterritorial zone of developing cartilage as proteoglycan aggregates. The sustained deposition of versican in the ECM may be dependent on the presence of LP. We tested this hypothesis by overexpressing LP in N1511 chondrogenic cells. Chondrocytic differentiation is induced in these cells by combined treatment with dexamethasone and parathyroid hormone at the confluence (24Kamiya N. Jikko A. Kimata K. Damsky C. Shimizu K. Watanabe H. J. Bone Miner Res. 2002; 17: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After the induction, these cells express versican, peaking at 48 h, and decreasing to 40 and 30% at days 4 and 13, respectively. The expression of aggrecan and LP appears at day 4 with a peak at day 13 (9Kamiya N. Watanabe H. Habuchi H. Takagi H. Shinomura T. Shimizu K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2390-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after the induction, versican and HA deposition in the ECM was observed (Fig. 5A) when endogenous LP and aggrecan were not detected (data not shown). Then we transfected subconfluent N1511 cells with an expression vector of human recombinant FLAG-LP. After 24 h, the cells reached confluence and were treated with parathyroid hormone and dexamethasone to induce differentiation. FLAG-LP was overexpressed and incorporated in the matrix and enhanced versican deposition (Fig. 5A). When samples of the extracellular matrix were extracted after cell lysis, treated with chondroitinase ABC, and immunoblotted, a significantly increased amount of versican core protein was observed in the matrix where FLAG-LP was overexpressed (Fig. 5B). In contrast to versican, HA deposition was not increased when LP was overexpressed (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that LP increases versican deposition by forming the proteoglycan aggregate. Versican Aggregates Inhibit Aggrecan Deposition—Both aggrecan and versican can form aggregates with LP and HA. We examined whether these proteoglycans form a composite aggregate or form their own aggregates in a mutually exclusive manner. We overexpressed FLAG-LP and induced differentiation in N1511 cells. At day 13, a large amount of versican remained in the ECM of LP-expressing cells. The mock-transfected cells showed a round, chondrocyte-like shape in Alcian blue-stained cartilaginous nodules, indicating chondrocyte differentiation with aggrecan deposition. In contrast, LP-expressing cell cultures showed much less Alcian blue-stained nodules (Fig. 6A). When the levels of Alcian blue staining were measured, aggrecan deposition was decreased to ∼25% in LP-expressing cells (Fig. 6B). By immunoblot, the levels of aggrecan in the conditioned medium of LP-expressing cells were significantly decreased (Fig. 6C). These results indicate that sustained deposition of versican aggregates inhibits subsequent aggrecan deposition. In this study, we have shown the presence of versican in cartilage. By immunostaining, versican is localized in the interterritorial zone of the articular surface, whereas aggrecan is mainly in the territorial zone of hypertrophic cells. Biochemical analysis of normal articular and cmd/cmd cartilage revealed that versican is present as a proteoglycan aggregate with both LP and HA. Disaccharide analysis has demonstrated that versican CS is less sulfated than aggrecan CS. In vitro studies using chondrocytic N1511 cells demonstrated that LP overexpression at an early stage of differentiation enhanced versican deposition and inhibited subsequent aggrecan deposition. Taken together, these results suggest that cartilage contains both aggrecan aggregates and versican aggregates, which may play their own roles in articular cartilage. Versican is transiently expressed in the mesenchymal condensation area and is still observed at the epiphyseal end at E15 (8Shibata S. Fukada K. Imai H. Abe T. Yamashita Y. J. Anat. 2003; 203: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although previous immunohistochemical studies failed to detect versican in human adult cartilage (3Bode-Lesniewska B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Odermatt B.F. Briner J. Heitz P.U. Zimmermann D.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), biochemical studies demonstrated the presence of versican in human articular cartilage from the fetal stage to mature adult (13Sztrolovics R. Grover J. Cs-Szabo G. Shi S.L. Zhang Y. Mort J.S. Roughley P.J. J. Orthop. Res. 2002; 20: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An age-associated decrease in versican transcription of the human articular cartilage has also been reported (11Grover J. Roughley P.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have shown that versican is present on the articular surface of mice at 2 weeks after birth. Its transcription in cartilage rapidly decreases from 2- to 8-week-old mice as assessed by real-time quantitative PCR, which may partly be due to a decreased ratio of articular chondrocytes in the total cell population in cartilage. In contrast, deposition remained at 8 weeks. These observations, together with previous reports, suggest that cells on the margin of developing cartilage continuously synthesize versican and may eventually reside as articular chondrocytes and that versican secreted at early stages of life remains in the interterritorial zone of articular cartilage. We have shown for the first time that versican is present in the form of aggregates with HA and LP in normal articular and cmd/cmd cartilage, using associative and dissociative CsCl ultracentrifugation methods (28Hascall V.C. Kimura J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 769-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Extraction under associative conditions followed by ultracentrifugation excludes the possibility of reconstitution of the aggregate during these biochemical procedures. Versican was separated at a density slightly lower than the condition for aggrecan, indicating that this method is useful for the purification of versican in various tissues. Repeated CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation successfully removed most aggrecan aggregates, and versican was co-fractionated with both HA and LP, suggesting that these proteoglycans are unlikely to form a composite aggregate. The versican G1 domain interacts with both LP and HA at the B-B′ segment (21Matsumoto K. Shionyu M. Go M. Shimizu K. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Watanabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41205-41212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) in contrast to aggrecan G1, which binds HA at B-B′ and binds LP at the A subdomain. This different manner of interaction may give rise to the possibility that versican aggregates are replaced with aggrecan aggregates, by exchanging HA and LP. However, our result showing that the sustained deposition of versican aggregates inhibited subsequent aggrecan deposition in differentiating N1511 cells does not support this hypothesis. The versican aggregate is as stable as the aggrecan aggregate, and the interaction of versican with either LP or HA is as strong as that of aggrecan with these molecules (21Matsumoto K. Shionyu M. Go M. Shimizu K. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Watanabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41205-41212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, the versican aggregate, once formed, may remain and inhibit further deposition of aggrecan aggregates. Both aggrecan and versican contain globular domains at both N and C termini. Interaction of these globular domains with other molecules may be necessary to form the framework of the matrix structure, and the amount and structure of CS chains may determine the nature of the matrix. Whereas aggrecan contains >100 CS chains, versican contains up to ∼20. In addition, CS chains of versican are less sulfated than those of aggrecan, as shown in this study. Indeed, extraction efficiency of versican by 0.5 m GdnHCl was lower than that of aggrecan. These differences may endow versican with both biochemically and physically specific roles. Versican binds to a greater variety of molecules, including fibronectin (29Yamagata M. Suzuki S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8012-8018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and midkine (30Zou K. Muramatsu H. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Salama R.H. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Muramatsu T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4046-4053Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), than aggrecan. Recently, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/Smad-3 signals have been suggested as essential for repressing articular chondrocyte differentiation. Without this, chondrocytes break the quiescent state and undergo abnormal terminal differentiation (31Yang X. Chen L. Xu X. Li C. Huang C. Deng C.X. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). As versican is known to bind fibrillin-1 (32Isogai Z. Aspberg A. Keene D.R. Ono R.N. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4565-4572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which interacts with latent TGF-β-binding protein-1 (LTBP-1) (33Isogai Z. Ono R.N. Ushiro S. Keene D.R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 2750-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), it may regulate TGF-β-mediated signal transduction through the interaction of fibrillin-1 and LTBP-1. Articular cartilage requires a physical property that resists shear force in the surface area and compression in the deeper zone. Together with compact collagen fibers, versican aggregates, with CS chains of decreased number and sulfation levels compared with aggrecan, may provide an appropriate ECM structure of the articular surface. The patterns and levels of CS sulfation depend on the activity of chondroitin sulfotransferases in individual cells. Versican from mouse embryos at E13.5 contains 6-sulfated and 4-sulfated disaccharides, comparable with ∼90% nonsulfated disaccharides (30Zou K. Muramatsu H. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Salama R.H. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Muramatsu T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4046-4053Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Embryonic chondrocytes may have much less C6-sulfotransferase activity than embryonic fibroblasts. In the same context, versican-expressing articular chondrocytes may have less C4-sulfotransferase activity than aggrecan-expressing chondrocytes. Versican aggregates in the articular cartilage may provide another important role in destructive joint diseases such as osteoarthritis (34Nishida Y. Shinomura T. Iwata H. Miura T. Kimata K. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1994; 2: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because versican is degraded by aggrecanase-1 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif-4, ADAMTS-4) (35Sandy J.D. Westling J. Kenagy R.D. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Verscharen C.

Further studies are required to understand the in vivo roles of versican in cartilage development and homeostasis and in joint destructive diseases. We thank Dr. T.

https://openalex.org/W2006703184,"The development and progression of cancer is controlled by gene expression, often regulated through chromatin packaging. Heterochromatin protein 1Hsα (HP1Hsα), one of three human HP1 family members, participates in heterochromatin formation and gene regulation. HP1Hsα possesses an amino-terminal chromodomain, which binds methylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (meK9 H3), and a carboxyl-terminal chromoshadow domain (CSD) that is required for dimerization and interaction with partner proteins. HP1Hsα is down-regulated in invasive metastatic breast cancer cells compared with poorly invasive nonmetastatic breast cancer cells. Expression of EGFP-HP1Hsα in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells causes a reduction in in vitro invasion, without affecting cell growth. Conversely, knock-down of HP1Hsα levels in the poorly invasive breast cancer cell line MCF-7 increased invasion, without affecting cell growth. To determine whether functions of the CSD were required for the regulation of invasion, mutant forms of HP1Hsα were expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells. A W174A mutation that disrupts interactions between HP1Hsα and PXVXL-containing partner proteins reduced invasion similar to that of the wild type protein. In contrast, an I165E mutation that disrupts dimerization of HP1Hsα did not decrease invasion. No gross changes in localization and abundance of HP1Hsβ, HP1Hsγ, and meK9 H3 were observed upon expression of wild type and mutant forms of HP1Hsα in MDA-MB-231 cells.

Mortality from breast cancer occurs by the spread of cancer cells to secondary sites within the body, a process called metastasis (1Price J.E. Cancer. 1990; 66 (Suppl. 6,): 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Breast cancer cells must acquire several properties in order to disseminate from the primary tumor, including the ability to degrade and migrate through the extracellular matrix, a process called invasion (2Guo W. Giancotti F.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 816-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Invasion is one of the first steps in the metastatic cascade and is a strong indicator of tumor progression. Two classes of proteins have been identified that regulate metastasis progression: activators and suppressors (3Debies M.T. Welch D.R. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Metastasis activators are genes that promote metastasis, whereas metastasis suppressors inhibit metastasis. In contrast to tumor suppressors, metastasis suppressors do not affect growth of the primary tumor (3Debies M.T. Welch D.R. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although several genes have been identified that regulate metastasis, clinically valuable predictive or prognostic molecular markers for metastasis have yet to be determined (4Hayes D.F. Isaacs C. Stearns V. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 375-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 5Weigelt B. Peterse J.L. van 't Veer L.J. Nat. Rev.

Currently, the best indicator for metastasis is lymph node micrometastases (4Hayes D.F. Isaacs C. Stearns V. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 375-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, microarray-based studies to identify transcription profiles that predict metastasis are in development (5Weigelt B.

Mori M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2005; 22: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify genes with altered expression in breast cancer metastasis, a differential display analysis was performed comparing gene expression between poorly invasive nonmetastatic and highly invasive metastatic breast cancer cells (8Kirschmann D.A. Seftor E.A. Nieva D.R. Mariano E.A. Hendrix M.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 55: 127-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Ainsztein A.M. Earnshaw W.C. Wallrath L.L. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3359-3363PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this reduction in mRNA, HP1Hsα protein levels showed an even larger disparity (7.1-fold) between the two types of breast cancer cells (9Kirschmann D.A. Lininger R.A. Gardner L.M. Seftor E.A. Odero V.A. Ainsztein A.M. Earnshaw W.C. Wallrath L.L. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3359-3363PubMed Google Scholar). HP1Hsα protein was also less abundant in metastatic tissues than in primary breast cancer tissues, suggesting that the down-regulation in highly invasive metastatic breast cancer cell lines recapitulate trends that were observed in clinical samples (9Kirschmann D.A. Lininger R.A. Gardner L.M. Seftor E.A. Odero V.A. Ainsztein A.M. Earnshaw W.C. Wallrath L.L. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3359-3363PubMed Google Scholar). HP1 is a highly conserved protein originally identified in Drosophila melanogaster as a component of chromatin near centromeres (10James T.C. Elgin S.C. Mol. Cell.

HP1 proteins are classically known to silence genes that have been juxtaposed to centric chromatin, and the degree of silencing is dependent on HP1 dosage (12Norwood L.E. Hines K.A. Wallrath L.L.

Three HP1 family members have been identified in humans: HP1Hsα, HP1Hsβ, and HP1Hsγ. All HP1 family members consist of two conserved domains, the chromodomain (CD) and the chromoshadow domain (CSD), that are separated by a less conserved hinge region. The CD, within the amino-terminal region, folds into a structure containing three β-sheets and an α-helix that form a hydrophobic protein interaction pocket (14Ball L.J. Murzina N.V. Broadhurst R.W.

This interaction targets HP1 proteins to specific regions of the genome that are enriched in meK9 H3, such as those near centromeres (16Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A.

Commun. 2003; 301: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this report, the function of HP1Hsα has been investigated by assaying invasion and growth of breast cancer cells upon modulation of HP1Hsα levels. Structure/function analysis has revealed that HP1Hsα dimerization is essential for regulating invasion. Data presented here are consistent with the hypothesis that HP1Hsα functions as a breast cancer metastasis suppressor. Cells and Culture Conditions—MCF-7 cells were kindly supplied by Dr. F. Miller (Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI), and MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in complete medium (RPMI 1640, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA) and 10 mm gentamycin (Cellgro)). Adenoviral Constructs—The I165E and W174A mutants of HP1Hsα were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Invitrogen) using the pEGFP-HP1Hsα as a template (9Kirschmann D.A. Lininger R.A. Gardner L.M. Seftor E.A. Odero V.A. Ainsztein A.M. Earnshaw W.C. Wallrath L.L. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3359-3363PubMed Google Scholar). The primers used to generate the I165E mutation are: 5′-CCACAAATTGTGGAAGCATTTTATG-3′ and 5′-CATAAAATGCTTCCACAATTTGTGG-3′. The primers used to generate the W174A mutation are: 5′-GAGACTGACAGCGCATGCATATCC-3′ and 5′-GGATATGCATGCGCTGTCAGTCTC-3′. The mutant and wild-type EGFP-HP1Hsα were cloned into the Ad5 RSV K-NpA shuttle vector (University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core). As a control, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene was fused to a nuclear localization signal (isolated from pShooter pCMV/myc/nuc plasmid, Invitrogen) and cloned into the Ad5 RSV K-NpA shuttle vector. The adenoviral constructs were packaged into virus and used for infection of breast cancer cells (University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core). A short hairpin RNA interference (RNAi) construct for knock-down of HP1Hsα (shHP1Hsα) was designed using the “Shagging PCR Protocol” and the “RNAi oligo retriever” (27Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 28Paddison P.J. Hannon G.J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The resulting sequences were generated as reverse PCR primers (reverse primer 5′-AAAAAAAATATTCCACTTATCCCTCAACCACGCACCAAGCTTCGCGCGTGGTTAAGGGACAAGTGGAATATCGGTGTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAA-3′) and used in a PCR reaction in combination with a forward U6 primer and a pGEM-U6 promoter template (kind gift from Greg Hannon, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). The PCR product was cloned into the pGem-T vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently cloned into the Ad5 RSV K-NpA shuttle vector. shHP1Hsα was designed to target the HP1Hsα mRNA starting at position 272. The shRNA construct was packaged in combination with a viral backbone containing EGFP in the E3 region driven by a RSV promoter for identification of infected cells (University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core). Negative controls consisted of a short hairpin RNAi construct against GFP (shGFP) expressed from either a U6 or CMV promoter (University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core). Adenoviral Infection—MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells were grown to 50-70% confluency in complete medium. Prior to infection, the medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 plus 1% fetal bovine serum and 10 mm gentamycin. Adenovirus was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 2 h of incubation, complete medium, was added to the cells. Twenty-four hours post-infection, the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium. A multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 60 plaque-forming units/cell was used for the EGFP-HP1Hsα adenovirus to infect MDA-MB-231 cells. To ensure equivalent amounts of protein expression, the m.o.i. of the adenoviruses expressing EGFPNLS, I165E, and W174A was adjusted so that the proteins were expressed in equal amounts to EGFP-HP1Hsα. Therefore, the m.o.i. for the EGFP-NLS, I165E, and W174A adenoviruses was 5, 10, and 30 plaque-forming units/cell, respectively. The m.o.i. used for infection of MCF-7 cells with both the shGFP and shHP1Hsα adenoviruses was 62 plaque-forming units/cell. Western Analysis—Protein expression was determined by Western analysis using antibodies against GFP (Molecular Probes), HP1Hsα (clones MAB14.5 (3Debies M.T. Welch D.R. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and MAB15.19 (2Guo W. Giancotti F.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 816-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar), kind gifts of Frank Rauscher III, Wistar Institute), HP1Hsβ (MAB3448, Chemicon), HP1Hsγ (MAB3450, Chemicon), di-meK9 H3 (07-441, Upstate Biotechnology), tri-meK9 H3 (07-442, Upstate Biotechnology), and β-tubulin (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). Goat α-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Upstate Biotechnology) and goat α-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Tissue Culture/Hybridoma Core, University of Iowa) were used as secondary antibodies. Localization of Proteins—Twenty-four hours post-infection, cells (1 × 105 MDA-MB-231; 5 × 104 MCF-7) were collected and plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates. Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were either examined for EGFP fluorescence (unfixed cells) or fixed with 100% methanol for 5 min and allowed to dry for 1 min. Fixed cells were rehydrated with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and immunostained with α-HP1Hsα, α-HP1Hsβ, α-HP1Hsγ (MAB14.5 (3Debies M.T. Welch D.R. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) from Dr. Frank Rauscher III; MAB3448 and MAB3450 from Chemicon), α-di-meK9 H3, or α-tri-meK9 H3 (07-441 and 07-442, respectively; Upstate Biotechnology). A rhodamine red conjugated goat α-mouse antibody was used for detection (Molecular Probes). Cells were visualized under a fluorescent microscope (Leica DMLB) for EGFP and rhodamine fluorescence using the ×100 objective. In Vitro Invasion Assays—In vitro invasion of breast cancer cells was performed using the Membrane Invasion Culture System (MICS) as described previously (9Kirschmann D.A. Lininger R.A. Gardner L.M. Seftor E.A. Odero V.A. Ainsztein A.M. Earnshaw W.C. Wallrath L.L. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3359-3363PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hendrix M.J. Seftor E.A. Seftor R.E. Fidler I.J. Cancer Lett. 1987; 38: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Relative percent invasion was calculated by taking the mean of the technical replicates within each MICS chamber, dividing the total number of invading cells by the total number of cells seeded times 100, and normalizing to the control condition. The experiments were repeated three or four times, and the p value was calculated using the Microsoft Excel t test function. Growth Assays—Twenty-four hours post-infection, cells were collected and plated (5 × 104 cells MDA-MB-231; 2 × 105 MCF-7) in each well of a 6-well plate. Cells were collected for each sample from one well at specific time points, and the cell number was counted using a hemocytometer. Cell Cycle Assays—Forty-eight hours post-infection, 1 × 106 MDAMB-231 cells were collected, resuspended in 1× PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed in 1× PBS, treated with RNase A, stained with a final concentration of 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometer (BD Biosciences FACScan), and the numbers of cells in each phase of the cell cycle were analyzed. BrdUrd Incorporation Assays—Forty-eight hours post-infection, 5 × 105 cells were plated in 24-well plates on top of glass coverslips, incubated for 24 h (37 °C with 5% CO2), and then treated with 10 μm BrdUrd (12, 6, 3, or 1 h). The cells were fixed with methanol, blocked with 1× PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, treated with 1.5 n HCl, and immunostained with α-BrdUrd antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). Goat α-mouse rhodamine (Molecular Probes) was used as a secondary antibody. The cells were co-stained with 1 μg/μl DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were visualized under a fluorescent microscope (Leica DMLB). The percent BrdUrd incorporated cells was calculated as the total number of BrdUrd positive cells/total number of cells (DAPI positive). Expression of HP1Hsα in MDA-MB-231 Cells—Because of the correlation between low levels of HP1Hsα and breast cancer invasion/metastasis, our objective was to modulate the levels of HP1Hsα in breast cancer cell lines and assay for effects on cell growth and invasion. Adenoviral constructs expressing either enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tagged with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) as a negative control or EGFP fused to HP1Hsα were generated. To determine whether GFP altered the function of HP1Hsα, the EGFP-HP1Hsα fusion protein was expressed in Drosophila, for which functional assays exist (30Norwood L.E. Grade S.K. Cryderman D.E. Hines K.A. Furiasse N. Toro R. Li Y. Dhasarathy A. Kladde M.P. Hendrix M.J. Kirschmann D.A. Wallrath L.L. Gene. 2004; 336: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Three lines of evidence demonstrate that EGFP does not alter function of HP1Hsα: 1) EGFP-HP1Hsα localized to sites of endogenous HP1 on Drosophila salivary gland polytene chromosomes; 2) EGFPHP1Hsα enhanced silencing of genes near heterochromatin in a dosage-dependent manner; and 3) EGFP-HP1Hsα rescued lethality associated with mutations in the gene encoding HP1 (30Norwood L.E. Grade S.K. Cryderman D.E. Hines K.A. Furiasse N. Toro R. Li Y. Dhasarathy A. Kladde M.P. Hendrix M.J. Kirschmann D.A. Wallrath L.L. Gene. 2004; 336: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of EGFP-HP1Hsα expression in breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with adenovirus encoding EGFP-HP1Hsα at levels similar to that of endogenous HP1Hsα in MCF-7 cells, recapitulating physiological levels in noninvasive breast cancer cells (Fig. 1). As a negative control, EGFP-NLS was expressed in MDAMB-231 cells at levels comparable with that of EGFP-HP1Hsα (Fig. 2A). The localization of EGFP-HP1Hsα was examined in both fixed and unfixed cells. EGFP-HP1Hsα localized to small discrete foci within the nucleus and co-localized with endogenous HP1Hsα in fixed cells (Fig. 3 and data not shown), the pattern anticipated from previous localization studies (9Kirschmann D.A. Lininger R.A. Gardner L.M. Seftor E.A. Odero V.A. Ainsztein A.M. Earnshaw W.C. Wallrath L.L. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3359-3363PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hayakawa T. Haraguchi T. Masumoto H.

In contrast, EGFP-NLS exhibited a diffuse nuclear localization pattern (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Expression of EGFPNLS did not alter endogenous HP1Hsα expression as assayed by reverse transcriptase PCR, nor did EGFP-NLS cause a change in endogenous HP1Hsα localization (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the EGFP-tagged proteins properly localize in the nucleus of MDA-MB-231 cells.FIGURE 2Expression of the EGFP-tagged proteins and in vitro invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells.

B, MDA-MB-231 cells either uninfected or infected with adenovirus expressing EGFP-NLS or EGFP-HP1Hsα were assayed for invasion through a laminin/collagen IV/gelatin membrane for 24 h and the relative percent invasion calculated. The p values were calculated using Excel t test. Four independent cultures were tested in triplicate.

Left, bright field; right, immunofluorescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous experiments using MDA-MB-231 cells with stable expression of HP1Hsα showed a reduction in invasion in vitro compared with controls (9Kirschmann D.A. Lininger R.A. Gardner L.M. Seftor E.A. Odero V.A. Ainsztein A.M. Earnshaw W.C. Wallrath L.L. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3359-3363PubMed Google Scholar). To determine how HP1Hsα induces this change, we first needed to reproduce this effect using an adenoviral system that allowed for greater flexibility in protein expression. The effect of expressing HP1Hsα by adenovirus infection on the invasive potential of MDA-MB-231 cells was measured using the membrane invasion culture system (29Hendrix M.J. Seftor E.A. Seftor R.E. Fidler I.J. Cancer Lett. 1987; 38: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells infected with a virus expressing EGFP-NLS did not have a significantly different invasive potential than uninfected cells (106 versus 100%, respectively; p = 0.455) (Fig. 2B). MDA-MB-231 cells infected with EGFP-HP1Hsα have a reduced invasive potential compared with uninfected cells (76 versus 100%, respectively; p = 0.023) or compared with EGFP-NLS (72 versus 100%, respectively; p = 0.015) (Fig. 2, B and C). These results provide evidence that HP1Hsα is involved in the suppression of breast cancer cell invasion, consistent with previously published data (9Kirschmann D.A. Lininger R.A. Gardner L.M. Seftor E.A. Odero V.A. Ainsztein A.M. Earnshaw W.C. Wallrath L.L. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3359-3363PubMed Google Scholar). Dimerization Is Required for HP1Hsα Suppression of Invasion in MDA-MB-231 Cells—With the adenoviral system established, we investigated the mechanism of HP1Hsα invasion modulation using HP1Hsα with mutations in the CSD. The ability of HP1 proteins to dimerize is hypothesized to be important for heterochromatin formation and for recruitment of partner proteins. Thus, the CSD is a good candidate for analysis because amino acid substitutions exist that separate dimerization and partner proteins interactions (Fig. 2D) (20Brasher S.V. Smith B.O. Fogh R.H.

The isoleucine 165 (Ile-165) residue of HP1Hsα is necessary for CSD dimerization. HP1Hsα proteins with mutations in this residue (to an alanine, glutamate, or lysine) are subsequently unable to dimerize and bind PXVXL-containing proteins (20Brasher S.V. Smith B.O. Fogh R.H.

https://openalex.org/W2039153066,"The major histocompatibility complex class I molecules consist of three subunits, the 45-kDa heavy chain, the 12-kDa β2-microglobulin (β2m), and an ∼8-9-residue antigenic peptide. Without β2m, the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules cannot assemble, thereby abolishing their transport to the cell membrane and the subsequent recognition by antigen-specific T cells. Here we report a case of defective antigen presentation caused by the expression of a β2m with a Cys-to-Trp substitution at position 25 (β2mC25W). This substitution causes misfolding and degradation of β2mC25W but does not result in complete lack of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecule expression on the surface of melanoma VMM5B cells. Despite HLA class I expression, VMM5B cells are not recognized by HLA class I-restricted, melanoma antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes even following loading with exogenous peptides or transduction with melanoma antigen-expressing viruses. Lysis of VMM5B cells is restored only following reconstitution with exogenous or endogenous wild-type β2m protein. Together, our results indicate impairment of antigenic peptide presentation because of a dysfunctional β2m and provide a mechanism for the lack of close association between HLA class I expression and susceptibility of tumor cells to cytotoxic T lymphocytes-mediated lysis in malignant diseases.

Wiley D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 277-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Expression of these molecules on the cell surface requires the stepwise assembly of HCs, β2m, and peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) followed by the transport of the trimeric molecule to the plasma membrane. These processes are dependent on a functional antigen processing machinery (APM), which includes the proteasome subunits, the peptide transporters TAP1 and TAP2, and a number of ER-resident chaperons such as calnexin, calreticulin, ERp57, and tapasin (2Cresswell P. Bangia N. Dick T. Diedrich G. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 3Yewdell J. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 125-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). β2m plays an integral part in the assembly and transport of HLA class I molecules because it stabilizes the HC-β2m heterodimer through non-covalent protein-protein interactions, thereby allowing binding of endogenous antigenic peptides with the help of TAP and tapasin (4Hansen T.H. Lee D.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 64: 105-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, the assembled HC-β2m-peptide trimeric complexes can travel to the cell surface, where they are recognized by HLA class I-restricted, antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The lack of HLA class I molecule expression on the cell surface usually reflects defects in β2m protein synthesis caused by mutations in the β2m gene, as has been found mostly in malignant cells thus far (5Ferrone S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 1-86Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This abnormality renders tumor cells resistant to tumor antigen-specific CTLs and may have a negative impact on the elimination of tumor cells by host CTLs. The defects underlying β2m loss have thus far been found to be structural in nature, involving lack of translation because of small deletions or point mutations in most cases and lack of transcription because of large deletions in a few cases (5Ferrone S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 1-86Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Because of a lack of β2m expression, the resulting HLA class I loss cannot be corrected by interferon (IFN-γ), a cytokine that up-regulates the expression of most of the molecules participating in the assembly and transport of HLA class I molecules. On the other hand, a low level of HLA class I expression on cells usually reflects nonstructural defects in the APM components because this abnormality can be corrected by IFN-γ (6Seliger B. Maeurer M.J. Ferrone S. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 455-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have elucidated the mechanism underlying HLA class I down-regulation identified in a melanoma cell line and in the metastasis from which the cell line was derived (7Yamshchikov G.V.

This HLA class I down-regulation phenotype cannot be corrected by IFN-γ and was unexpectedly found to be caused by an abnormal full-length β2m protein that can neither form stable complexes with HCs nor assist in loading peptides onto the HLA class I peptide binding groove.

R-phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse Fcγ F(ab′)2 fragments and goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies were purchased from Dako (Carpinteria, CA) and GE Healthcare, respectively. Peptides, IFN-γ, Wild-type Human β2m, and Pharmacological Inhibitors—The HLA class I-associated peptides HER2/neu369-377, KIFGSLAFL, and tyrosinase369-377D YMDGTMSQV were synthesized with a free amide N terminus and free acid C terminus by standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry using a model AMS422 peptide synthesizer (Gilson Co. Inc., Middleton, WI). Peptides were purified to >98% purity by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a C-8 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) at the University of Virginia biomolecular core facility. Purity and identity were confirmed using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Recombinant human IFN-γ was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The wild-type human β2m was purchased from Sigma. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the trans-Golgi-to-secretory vesicles traffic inhibitor monensin were purchased from Sigma and Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA), respectively. Low pH Treatment of Cells and Restabilization of Cell Surface HLA Class I Molecules—Low pH treatment of cells was performed as described previously (21Sugawara S. Abo T. Kumagai K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 100: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets containing ∼1-10 × 106 cells were resuspended with 0.5 ml of stripping buffer (0.13 m citric acid, 66 mm Na2HPO4, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 3.0) for 2 min on ice and then neutralized immediately with 50 ml of RPMI 1640 medium. After three washes, cells (1 × 106) were pulsed with 40 μg/ml peptide and 2.5 μg/ml human β2m (Sigma) for 3 h at room temperature and then washed three times with 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequently, cells were subjected to staining and flow cytometric analysis as described. Flow Cytometry—Cell surface staining and intracellular staining were performed as described (22Ogino T. Wang X. Ferrone S. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 278: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Results are presented as -fold increase in mean fluorescence intensity over the control (-fold MFI). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA isolation from cells was performed with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA synthesis was conducted using the SuperScript™ system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR was performed using β2m-specific primers, forward 261 (5′-CCTGAAGCTGACAGCATTCG-3′) and reverse 262 (5′-ACCTCCATGATGCTGCTTAC-3′); GAPDH-specific primers, GAPDH-F (5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3′) and GAPDH-R (5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′). PCR products were run on a 1.2% agarose gel (Roche Applied Science) and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The predicted sizes of PCR products were 401 bp for β2m and 983 bp for GAPDH. The PCR products were gel-purified, and their sequences were analyzed by a DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM model 377, Applied Biosystems). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis of cell lysates with β2m-, HLA class I heavy chain-, and APM component-specific antibodies was performed as described (22Ogino T. Wang X. Ferrone S. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 278: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA Extraction and PCR—Genomic DNA extraction was performed with blood and cell culture DNA midi kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification of β2m gene exon 2 was conducted with the primers, 491 intron 1-specific (5′-CCTGGCAATATTAATGTG-3′) and 462 intron 2-specific (5′-CATACACAACTTTCAGCAGCT-3′). The predicted PCR product size is 362 bp. The PCR products were gel-purified and their sequences analyzed by a DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM model 377, Applied Biosystems). Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis of the β2m Gene—LOH analysis of the β2m gene was performed as described previously (23Ramal L.M. Feenstra M. van der Zwan A.W. Collado A. Lopez-Nevot M.A. Tilanus M. Garrido F. Tissue Antigens. 2000; 55: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, purified genomic DNA (100 ng) was subjected to a PCR amplification using two pairs of primers specific to the two short tandem repeat markers (D15S126 and D15S209) located near the β2m gene. The sequences of the primers are as follows: D15S126F, 5′-GTGAGCCAAGATGGCACTAC-3′; D15S126R, 5′-GCCAGCAATAATGGGAAGTT-3′; D15S209F, 5′-AAACATAGTGCTCTGGAGGC-3′; and D15S209R, 5′-GGGCTAACAACAGTGTCTGC-3′. The amplification conditions are as follows: 95 °C for 12 min, 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s for 10 cycles; 89 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s for 20 cycles; and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were then fractionated on a 4% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The intensity of the staining was determined by the AlphaImager™ 2200 system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). LOH is determined by the following formula: (intensity of tumor allele one/intensity of tumor allele two)/(intensity of normal allele one/intensity of normal allele two) (referred to as the percent LOH index). An LOH index less than 50% is considered significant. Radiolabeling of Cells, Indirect Immunoprecipitation, and SDSPAGE—Radiolabeling of cells, indirect immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE were performed as described (24Bangia N. Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A. Surman M. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1858-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Transfection—Cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the wild-type β2m or the mutant β2m (β2mC25W) utilizing Lipofectamine-mediated gene transfer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, pcDNA3.1-b2m, pcDNA3.1-b2mC25W, or the empty plasmid pcDNA3.1-neo (Invitrogen) was mixed with Lipofectamine™ 2000 before being added to melanoma cells grown in monolayers with a 90% confluence. Cells were selected 2 days after transfection in medium containing G418 sulfate (1 mg/ml) (Calbiochem). After ∼2-3 weeks of selection, G418-resistant clones were picked, expanded, and screened by flow cytometry for HLA class I expression. Positive clones were then further expanded in complete media supplemented with a maintenance dose (0.3 mg/ml) of G418. Recombinant Vaccinia Virus—Virus encoding full-length human tyrosinase (TyrVac) was constructed as described previously (25Mosse C.A. Meadows L. Luckey C.J. Kittlesen D.J. Huczko E.L. Slingluff C.L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant vaccinia virus stock was titered and tested for proper expression of tyrosinase using specific HLA-A2-restricted CTL (data not shown). Cytotoxicity Assay in Vitro—Standard 51Cr release assays were performed to determine CTL recognition of the HLA-A2-restricted epitope from the melanocyte differentiation protein tyrosinase (tyrosinase369-377D). Target cells were prepared by either loading with tyrosinase369-377D peptide (40 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature or by infecting with TyrVac (10 plaque-forming units/cell, 106 target cells) in 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1.6 mm MgSO4, and 1.8 mm CaCl2 for 1 h and then 4 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 8 h to allow for expression followed by labeling with 100 μCi of Na51CrO4 for 1 h for a standard 4 h 51Cr release assay. Percent cytotoxicity was calculated by the formula: % specific lysis = ((experimental release - spontaneous release)/(total release - experimental release)) × 100. Marked HLA Class I Down-regulation on VMM5B Melanoma Cells— Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of cells stained with mAb W6/32 showed that HLA class I molecules were barely detectable on melanoma cells VMM5B as compared with autologous VMM5A melanoma cells (Fig. 1A). The low level of staining of VMM5B cells with mAb W6/32 does not represent nonspecific background staining because no staining was detected when the β2m-deficient FO-1 cells (8D'Urso C.M. Wang Z.G. Cao Y. Tatake R. Zeff R.A. Ferrone S. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) were stained with mAb W6/32. Incubation of VMM5B cells with IFN-γ (300 units/ml) for 48 h at 37 °C had no detectable effect on the staining of VMM5B cells, as well as FO-1 cells, by mAb W6/32. To corroborate the specificity of the staining of VMM5B cells by mAb W6/32, cells were treated with low pH (pH 3.0) and then stained with mAb W6/32, a method used to disintegrate the trimeric HLA class I complex on the cell surface (21Sugawara S. Abo T. Kumagai K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 100: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, following treatment with pH 3.0, VMM5B cells were not stained by mAb W6/32. These results imply the dissociation of peptides and β2m from the HCs because the antigenic determinant recognized by mAb W6/32 requires the association of HCs with β2m for its expression (10Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. Brown G. Galfre G. Milstein C. Williams A.F. Ziegler A. Cell. 1978; 14: 9-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). This possibility is supported by the restoration of the staining with mAb W6/32 following loading of low pH-treated VMM5B cells with wild-type β2m along with a HLA-A2-binding peptide (HER-2/neu369-397, KIFGSLAFL, t½ = 481.2 min). This result reflects the reassembly of the trimeric HLA class I complex on the cell surface. It is noteworthy that the level of the restored HLA class I expression is similar to that on untreated cells, remaining at a low level, unlike the full restoration of HLA class I expression on low pH-treated autologous VMM5A cells following loading with exogenous peptide and β2m (data not shown). These results suggest that the amount of HCs transported to the plasma membrane is the limiting factor in VMM5B cells. This finding is different from the efficient transport to the cell surface of open-form (peptide-free or low affinity peptide-bound) HCs, which can subsequently be refolded to their native, bioactive conformation following loading with a high affinity peptide, as has been observed in the TAP-deficient T2 cells (3Yewdell J. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 125-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). To determine whether the low level of HLA class I molecules on the membrane of VMM5B cells is caused by a reduced level of all HCs and/or by a defect in β2m, HC and β2m expression in VMM5A and VMM5B cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, HCs were detected in both cell lysates and were markedly up-regulated by IFN-γ. In contrast, β2m was barely detectable with β2m-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies in a VMM5B cell lysate following IFN-γ treatment. β2m was not detected in a VMM5B cell lysate with a panel of β2m-specific mouse mAb (Fig. 2A and data not shown). The latter results may reflect the insufficient sensitivity of the Western blotting technique because β2m was detected in VMM5B cells by intracellular staining with the β2m-specific mAb L368 (Fig. 2B). These results in conjunction with the lack of up-regulation of HLA class I molecules by IFN-γ suggest that the abnormal HLA class I phenotype of VMM5B cells is caused by a defect in β2m. Cys-to-Trp substitution in β2m Caused by a Point Mutation in the β2m Gene in VMM5B Cells—To investigate whether structural mutation(s) underlie the low β2m level and its functional abnormalities, we amplified the full-length β2m cDNA fragments (Fig. 3A) and performed nucleotide sequencing of the open reading frame of the β2m gene in VMM5B cells. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, a cytosine-to-guanine transversion mutation at position 135 in exon 2 was detected. This mutation changes codon 25 from Cys to Trp (β2mC25W) (Fig. 4A), abolishing the disulfide bond between residue 25 (Cys-25) and 80 (Cys-80) of the full-length β2m protein (B). It is noteworthy that this mutation was not acquired during in vitro culture of the VMM5B cell line because the identical mutated nucleotide was detected in the genomic DNA extracted from the melanoma metastasis from which the cell line had been derived (Fig. 5A). Moreover, the wild-type sequence of the β2m gene in VMM5B cells was not detected suggesting that one β2m gene copy was lost. This possibility is supported by the LOH identified at two chromosome 15 short tandem repeat sites (D15S126 and D15S209) (23Ramal L.M. Feenstra M. van der Zwan A.W. Collado A. Lopez-Nevot M.A. Tilanus M. Garrido F. Tissue Antigens. 2000; 55: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) flanking the β2m gene in genomic DNA extracted from VMM5B cells and the corresponding melanoma metastasis (Fig. 5, B and C).FIGURE 4Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of β2m cDNA synthesized from VMM5A and VMM5B cells.

C, the degree of LOH of the β2m locus in VMM5B cells and VMM5B metastasis is quantitatively presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Instability of β2mC25W in VMM5B Cells—To test whether loss of a disulfide bond in the mutant β2m identified in VMM5B cells caused conformational instability of the full-length protein, we examined the effect of Cys-to-Trp substitution at residue 25 on the stability of β2m structure using molecular modeling. The wild-type β2m is a β-sandwich structure composed of two anti-parallel β-pleated sheets connected by a disulfide bond between Cys-25 and Cys-80 (Fig. 6A). Each of the β-pleated sheets contains three β strands. In the wild-type Cys-25-Cys-80 hydrophobic core, the linked sulfur atoms exhibit favorable van der Waals contacts with respect to the surrounding atoms 4.43, 4.81, and 3.88 Å for Cys25SG-Val27CG1, Cys25SG-Gln8Cα, and Cys80SG-Val82CG2, respectively (Fig. 6B). However, when Cys-25 is replaced with Trp-25, the bulky indole ring of Trp side chain displays drastic steric clashes with the side chains of the neighboring residues. These clashes occur with all 14 possible Trp-25 side chain rotameric conformations analyzed. Fig. 6C shows one representative conformation in which the ring carbon and nitrogen members are within the unfavorable van der Waals distances with the neighboring atoms 2.63, 1.62, 2.74, and 1.95Å for Trp25CZ3-Tyr66CD1, Trp25CZ2-Val27CG1, Trp25NE1-Val82CG2, and Trp25CD1-Cys80SG, respectively. Because all of these distances are below 3.0Å, the minimum distance between two nonbonded carbon atoms, the free energy is drastically increased, leading to a thermodynamically unstable state of the mutantβ2m (β2mC25W). Degradation of β2mC25W and Lack of Stable HC-β2mC25W Association in VMM5B Cells—Next we tested whether β2mC25W was degraded by the proteasome in VMM5B cells, especially because it was present at a very low level intracellularly, approximately at a level 29-fold and 41-fold lower than that in VMM5A cells under basal conditions and following incubation with IFN-γ (300 units/ml), respectively (Fig. 2B). To this end, VMM5B cells were sequentially incubated with IFN-γ (300 units/ml) for 24 h at 37 °C and with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (5 μm) for 12 h at 37 °C. The intracellular levels of the steady-state free β2mC25W, free HCs, and HC-β2mC25W complexes in IFN-γ/MG132-treated and in IFN-γ-treated VMM5B cells were compared utilizing fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of cells intracellularly stained with mAbs. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, both the β2mC25W and HCs were increased ∼2-fold following incubation of cells with IFN-γ, but the level of HC-β2mC25W complexes remained unchanged. In the presence of IFN-γ and MG132, the level of β2mC25W increased markedly (5-fold above that in untreated cells) along with an ∼3-fold increase in HCs, but the level of HC-β2mC25W complexes still remained unchanged. On the other hand, increased secretion of β2mC25W did not appear to play a role in its low intracellular accumulation because the level of β2mC25W, HCs, and HC-β2mC25W complex expression was not increased by the addition, 4 h before harvest, of monensin, an inhibitor of trans-Golgi-to-secretory vesicles traffic, to MG132-treated cells cultured in the presence of IFN-γ. Therefore, β2mC25W was removed through proteasome-mediated degradation. Even when it accumulates, the mutant β2m cannot form stable complexes with HCs. This conclusion is corroborated by the lack of immunoprecipitation of HC-β2mC25W complexes with mAb W6/32 from MG132 and IFN-γ-treated VMM5B cell lysates (Fig. 7C). Attemp"
https://openalex.org/W2075930318,"The role of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in myocytes and adipocytes is controversial. Whereas studies involving the use of adenovirally mediated expression of kinase-inactive aPKC in L6 myocytes and 3T3/L1 and human adipocytes, and data from knock-out of aPKC in adipocytes derived from mouse embryonic stem cells and subsequently derived adipocytes, suggest that aPKCs are required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport, recent findings in studies of aPKC knockdown by small interfering RNA (RNAi) in 3T3/L1 adipocytes are conflicting. Moreover, there are no reports of aPKC knockdown in myocytes, wherein insulin effects on glucose transport are particularly relevant for understanding whole body glucose disposal. Presently, we exploited the fact that L6 myotubes and 3T3/L1 adipocytes have substantially different (30% nonhomology) major aPKCs, viz. PKC-zeta in L6 myotubes and PKC-lambda in 3T3/L1 adipocytes, that nevertheless can function interchangeably for glucose transport. Accordingly, in L6 myotubes, RNAi-targeting PKC-zeta, but not PKC-lambda, markedly depleted aPKC and concomitantly inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport; more importantly, these depleting/inhibitory effects were rescued by adenovirally mediated expression of PKC-lambda. Conversely, in 3T3/L1 adipocytes, RNAi constructs targeting PKC-lambda, but not PKC-zeta, markedly depleted aPKC and concomitantly inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport; here again, these depleting/inhibitory effects were rescued by adenovirally mediated expression of PKC-zeta. These findings in knockdown and, more convincingly, rescue studies, strongly support the hypothesis that aPKCs are required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport in myocytes and adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2094362822,"Estrogen receptors α (ERα) and β (ERβ) have distinct functions and differential expression in certain tissues. These differences have stimulated the search for subtype-selective ligands. Therapeutically, such ligands offer the potential to target specific tissues or pathways regulated by one receptor subtype without affecting the other. As reagents, they can be utilized to probe the physiological functions of the ER subtypes to provide information complementary to that obtained from knock-out animals. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay was used to screen a 10,000-compound chemical library for ER agonists. From the screen, we identified a family of ERβ-selective agonists whose members contain bulky oxabicyclic scaffolds in place of the planar scaffolds common to most ER ligands. These agonists are 10–50-fold selective for ERβ in competitive binding assays and up to 60-fold selective in transactivation assays. The weak uterotrophic activity of these ligands in immature rats and their ability to stimulate expression of an ERβ regulated gene in human U2OS osteosarcoma cells provides more physiological evidence of their ERβ-selective nature. To provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of their activity and selectivity, we determined the crystal structures of the ERα ligand-binding domain (LBD) and a peptide from the glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) coactivator complexed with the ligands OBCP-3M, OBCP-2M, and OBCP-1M. These structures illustrate how the bicyclic scaffolds of these ligands are accommodated in the flexible ligand-binding pocket of ER. A comparison of these structures with existing ER structures suggests that the ERβ selectivity of OBCP ligands can be attributed to a combination of their interactions with Met-336 in ERβ and Met-421 in ERα. These bicyclic ligands show promise as lead compounds that can target ERβ. In addition, our understanding of the molecular determinants of their subtype selectivity provides a useful starting point for developing other ER modulators belonging to this relatively new structural class.

Studies of knock-out mice have also shown that the two subtypes have distinct functions and are differentially expressed in certain tissues (1Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These differences have stimulated the search for subtype-specific ligands that can elicit tissue- or cell-specific ER activity. In particular, the dominance of ERα expression in the breast and uterus (7Korach K.S. Emmen J.M. Walker V.R. Hewitt S.C. Yates M. Hall J.M. Swope D.L. Harrell J.C. Couse J.F. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

The recent discovery of ERβ-selective ligands that display pathway-specific anti-inflammatory activity without classic estrogenic effects is an example of the possible therapeutic potential of subtype-selective ligands (9Harris H.A.

Furthermore, subtype-selective ligands show promise as reagents to probe the physiological functions of ERα and ERβ (10Harris H.A. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S.

Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Progress towards the development of subtype-selective ligands was significantly advanced with the reports of crystal structures of ERα (13Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2949) Google Scholar) and ERβ (14Pike A.C. Brzozowski A.M. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Thorsell A.G. Engstrom O. Ljunggren J. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4608-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). The ligand-binding pockets of the subtypes are similar but not identical. The ERβ ligand-binding pocket is smaller (390 Å3 versus 490 Å3 for ERα) and differs in two residues from ERα; Leu-384 and Met-421 in ERα are replaced by Met-336 and Ile-373, respectively, in ERβ (14Pike A.C. Brzozowski A.M. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Thorsell A.G. Engstrom O. Ljunggren J. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4608-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Notably, these two substitutions give rise to the selectivity of ligands for ERα or ERβ. Although several ERβ-selective ligands have been described (15Veeneman G.H. Curr. Med.

Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 2197-2207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) have been reported. These structures have provided valuable insights into possible molecular mechanisms of ERβ selectivity. However, when one considers the structural diversity of the known ERβ-selective ligands and the plasticity of the ER ligand-binding pocket, it is clear that more structures of ER subtype-selective ligands are needed to develop general mechanisms for subtype selectivity. We describe here the identification and characterization of a family of ligands sharing an oxabicyclic scaffold that are ER agonists and variably selective for ERβ. These ligands possess bulky bicyclic scaffolds that differ from the planar scaffolds common to most estrogenic compounds. Cell and animal studies demonstrate the promise of these ligands as agents that can target ERβ for therapeutic or investigational purposes. In addition, we obtained crystal structures with three of these ligands, OBCP-3M, OBCP-2M, and OBCP-1M, in complex with the ERα ligand-binding domain (LBD) and a glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) peptide. These structures provide evidence to suggest that the ERβ selectivity of the OBCP ligands can be attributed to their interactions with only two residues: Met-336 in ERβ and Met-421 in ERα. Reagents—The 10,000-compound chemical library (Library ET 350-1) used for ligand screening was obtained from ChemBridge (San Diego, CA). The means and S.D. values of clogP and molecular weight values for this library are 3.7 ± 1.6 and 340 ± 71, respectively. All compounds from the 5474 family (except OBCP-2M) were also obtained from ChemBridge. OBCP-2M was synthesized according to reported procedures for analogous compounds (23Chauzov V.A. Parchinskii V.Z. Zhurnal Obshchei Khimii. 1997; 67: 166-167Google Scholar, 24Chauzov V.A. Parchinskii V.Z. Zhurnal Obshchei Khimii. 1996; 66: 2061-2062Google Scholar). E2 and genistein were obtained from Sigma. Diarylpropionitrile (DPN) and propylpyrazole triol (PPT) were obtained from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). [3H]E2 was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Plasmids—Many of the plasmids used in these studies were generous gifts from colleagues: pGST-ERα-LBD (ERα residues 282–595) from Dr. Peter Kushner (University of California, San Francisco, CA), pCR3.1.SRC1 from Dr. Ming-Jer Tsai and Dr. Sophia Y. Tsai (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX), p3×ERE-Luc from Dr. Donald McDonnell (Duke University, Durham, NC), pCMV5-hERβ (full-length ERβ) and p6×His-ERβ LBD (residues 256–505) from Dr. Benita Katzenellenbogen (University of Illinois, Champaign, IL), HEGO/pSG5 (full-length ERα) from Dr. Pierre Chambon (Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Biology, Strasbourg, France), pAR and p3×ARE-Luc from Dr. Shutsung Liao (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL), and pMCSG7 from Dr. Frank Collart (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). pCMV-βgal was obtained from Invitrogen. The pFLAG-SRC1-His was constructed by cloning the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC1) fragment (residues 568–780) from pCR3.1.SRC1 into pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma) and subsequently subcloning into pET28b (Novagen). pFLAG-ERα and pFLAG-ERβ used in transient transfections were constructed by subcloning full-length hERα (from HEGO/pSG5) or hERβ (from pCMV5-hERβ) into pCMV-FLAG-2. p6×His-ERα LBD used in the competitive binding assays was constructed by subcloning ERα LBD (residues 304–554) into pET15b (Novagen). The ERα LBD (residues 298–554; Y537S) used for crystallization was expressed from pMCSG7 (25Stols L. Gu M. Dieckman L. Raffen R. Collart F.R. Donnelly M.I. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) as a fusion protein with a 23-residue N-terminal tag. The Y537S mutation was introduced to increase the solubility and yield of the ERα LBD for crystallization. From comparisons of the crystal structures of this mutant ER with wild type ER complexed to the same ligand, the mutation does not appear to cause significant changes to the overall conformation of the protein. 5S. S. Rajan, K. W. Nettles, R. W. Hsieh, and Geoffrey L. Greene, unpublished results. Protein Expression and Purification for in Vitro Assays—Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ERα LBD was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta cells (Novagen) by induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 25°C.The protocol for the purification of the GST-ERα LBD was similar to that which has been described elsewhere (26Lally J.M. Newman R.H. Knowles P.P. Islam S. Coffer A.I. Parker M. Freemont P.S. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). FLAG-SRC1, ERα LBD, and ERβ LBD were all expressed and purified as generally described. Proteins were expressed in Rosetta cells by induction with 0.6 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 25°C. Cell pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. After thawing, they were resuspended in 5 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% β-octyl glucoside, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), 3 m urea (for ER LBD), protein inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme) and sonicated on ice three times for 30 s each. The lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min to collect the supernatant, and the above procedure was repeated to extract additional soluble proteins from the cell debris. The two supernatant fractions were pooled and loaded on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The resin was washed with 5 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% β-octyl glucoside, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-ME, protein inhibitor mixture) and eluted with 10 column volumes of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 0.05% β-octyl glucoside, 250 mm imidazole, 4 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, protein inhibitor mixture). Collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE before selecting the purest protein fractions to concentrate. Additionally, ERα LBD and ERβ LBD were dialyzed in binding buffer (50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% β-octyl glucoside, and 0.1% (v/v) glycerol) and FLAG-SRC1 in HTRF buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 1 mm EDTA). Homogenous Time-resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) Assays—The anti-FLAG-XL665 and anti-GST-Eu(K) antibodies were from Cisbio International (Gif/Yvette Cedex, France) and the Wallac 1420 MicroPlate Reader from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. FLAG-SRC1 and GST-ERα LBD were diluted in HTRF buffer that included 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and preincubated with anti-FLAG-XL665 and anti-GST-Eu(K), respectively, for 1 h at 4°C.Thetwomixtures were then combined with test ligands (0.5%, v/v) and 2 m KF solution and incubated at 4 °C for 1–2 h with agitation. The plates were read on a Wallac 1420 MicroPlate Reader. The extent of the specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer was determined by taking a ratio of the emission intensities at 665 and 615 nm and scaled by 104. EC50 values in this and other assays were determined from the data using SigmaPlot (Systat Software). Competitive Binding Assays—His-tagged ERα LBD/ERβ LBD was diluted with binding buffer to 8–10 nm and added to the wells of nickel-coated FlashPlates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The proteins were incubated for ∼2 h at 25 °C to allow the ER to bind. Plates were then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline, before the addition of 1–2 nm [3H]E2 and test ligand diluted in binding buffer. The ligands were incubated for 4 h at 25 °Cor overnight at 4 °C, and the plates were analyzed with a MicroBeta Scintillation Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). IC50 and Ki values were determined from the data using SigmaPlot (Systat Software). Transient Transfection and Transactivation Assays—In the transient transfection of COS-7 and SKBR3 cells, DNA was delivered to the cells using PolyFect (Qiagen). In the case of SKBR3, 150 ng of p3×ERE-Luc, 30 ng of pFLAG-ERα/pFLAG-ERβ, and 30 ng of normalization plasmid (pCMV-βgal) were used. For the COS-7 ER assays, 300 ng of p3×ERE-Luc, 40 ng of pFLAG-ERα/pFLAG-ERβ, and 40 ng of pCMV-βgal were used. In the COS-7 androgen receptor (AR) assays, 150 ng of p3×ARE-Luc, 30 ng of pAR, and 30 ng of pCMV-βgal were used. Ligands that had been diluted 1:200 in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum were added to the cells 18–24 h before cell harvest and lysis. Luciferase activities from lysed cells were analyzed on a MicroBeta (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) luminescence counter, and values were normalized with those from β-galactosidase activity (Promega). Immature Rat Uterotrophic Growth Assays—Selected compounds were evaluated using the uterotrophic growth assay (27DeSombre E.R. Mease R.C. Sanghavi J. Singh T. Seevers R.H. Hughes A. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 29: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Groups of immature Sprague-Dawley female rats (10 per group for vehicle, 5 per group all others) were injected subcutaneously with 10, 50, and 250 nmol of test ligand in 100 μl of vehicle (10% Cremaphor EL (Fluka Biochemicals), 88% phosphate-buffered saline, and 2% ethanol) daily for 3 consecutive days. Vehicle alone and E2 at doses of 1 and 10 nmol were administered in the same manner over the same period as controls. Animals were sacrificed on the fourth day, 24 h after the last injection. Uteri were removed, stripped free of fat and connective tissue, and blotted on filter paper, and wet weight was measured. Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR Assays—U2OS-ERα and U2OS-ERβ cells (generous gifts from Drs. Thomas Spelsberg and David Monroe (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN)) were seeded in 6-well plates at 4–6 × 104 cells/well and pretreated for 24 h with 100 ng/ml doxycycline (Sigma). Cells were subsequently treated for an additional 24 h with ligands or vehicle (Me2SO) control in the presence of 100 ng/ml doxycycline to maintain ER expression. Each treatment group was performed in triplicate. Total RNA was prepared with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 2 μg of RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) before being reverse transcribed using the Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). A combination of oligo(dT) and random hexamers was used to prime the cDNA synthesis reaction. The resultant cDNA products were diluted to 40 μl, and 5 μl of cDNA was used in real time PCRs utilizing the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). The primer sequences used for real time PCR for angiotensinogen and β-actin have been previously reported by others (28Monroe D.G. Getz B.J. Johnsen S.A. Riggs B.L. Khosla S. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out using the ABI 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) for 48 cycles (94 °C for 15 s, 54–58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 40 s) after an initial 15-min incubation at 95 °C. RNA levels were determined for angiotensinogen and β-actin RNA by comparison with standard curves generated from reference RNA (Stratagene). Angiotensinogen expression was then normalized to the endogenous reference gene β-actin, and the relative expression was then determined by normalizing to the Me2SO-treated control. Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of ERα LBD—hERα LBD was expressed in BL21(DE3) magic strain E. coli (29Dieckman L. Gu M. Stols L. Donnelly M.I. Collart F.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Following isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction, the cell pellets in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm β-ME, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mm imidazole were incubated with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) and protein inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and then sonicated. The ER protein was purified on aNi2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), and the N-terminal polyhistidine tag was cleaved using tobacco etch virus protease (30Phan J. Zdanov A. Evdokimov A.G. Tropea J.E. Peters H.K. 3rd Kapust Li R.B. Wlodawer M. Waugh A.D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50564-50572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which carries a noncleavable polyhistidine tag. Following its separation from the protease and the tag on the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column, the cleaved protein was diluted 1:10 in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm β-ME, and 5% (v/v) glycerol and purified further on a mono-Q anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) using an NaCl gradient of 25 mm to 0.6 m. The protein eluted at 0.3 m NaCl and was dialyzed in 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.125 m NaCl, 10 mm β-ME, and 1.25% (v/v) glycerol. The protein was concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml, incubated overnight with a 1 mm concentration of both the ligand and the GRIP1 peptide (residues 686–698) prior to screening for crystallization conditions in sitting drops (2:1 protein/reservoir) with the commercially available screens Index (Hampton Research) and Wizard (Emerald Biosystems) at both 16 and 25 °C. Optimization of initial screen conditions yielded diffraction quality crystals of ER in ∼1 week at 16 °C in 0.2 m sodium malonate, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, pH 7.0, for OBCP-3M and in 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, pH 8.5, for OBCP-2M and OBCP-1M. Crystals were soaked in the mother liquor and 10% (v/v) glycerol prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Single wavelength (0.979 Å) native data sets were collected on a MarCCD detector at the 19-BM beamline (OBCP-3M) and on a Quantum 135 detector at the 14-BM beamline (OBCP-2M and OBCP-1M) of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory). Data were collected with an oscillation of 1.5, 1.0, and 0.5° and an exposure of 10, 12, and 3 s per image, to a resolution of 2.25, 2.10, and 1.80 Å with average redundancies of 3.6, 5.1, and 3.6 for OBCP-3M, OBCP-2M, and OBCP-1M structures, respectively. Data were integrated and merged using HKL2000 (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar) and then used in molecular replacement using MOLREP (32Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4152) Google Scholar) with the ER structure from Protein Data Bank entry 1L2I as the search model for the OBCP-3M structure and 1ZKY as the search model for both the OBCP-2M and OBCP-1M structures.

Missing residues and alternate conformations for some side chains were manually modeled and refined in subsequent cycles. The missing residues in the final models are at the termini and surface loops. Details of diffraction data collection and processing of the ER crystal complexes are shown in Table 5. The ribbon diagram was prepared with Swiss-PdbViewer (36Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

https://openalex.org/W2148484784,"The isoelectric points of the gap junction proteins connexin26 (Cx26) and connexin32 (Cx32) were determined by isoelectric focusing in free fluids. The isoelectric points were significantly more acidic than predicted from amino acid sequences and different from each other, allowing homomeric channels to be resolved separately. The isoelectric points of the homomeric channels bracketed the isoelectric points of heteromeric Cx26/Cx32 channels. For heteromeric channels, Cx26 and Cx32 were found in overlapping, pH-focused fractions, indicating quaternary structure was retained. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to identify post-translational modifications of Cx26 and Cx32 cytoplasmic domains, including the first reported post-translational modifications of Cx26. Suspected modifications were hydroxylation and/or phosphorylation near the amino terminus of both connexins, gamma-carboxyglutamate residues in the cytoplasmic loop of both connexins, phosphorylation in the carboxyl-terminal domain of Cx32, and palmitoylation at the carboxyl-terminus of Cx32. These modifications contribute to the measured acidic isoelectric points of Cx26 and Cx32, whereas their low molecular masses would not appreciably change connexin SDS-PAGE mobility. Most of these modifications have not previously been identified for connexins and may be instrumental in guiding and understanding novel aspects of channel trafficking and molecular mechanisms of channel regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2042225645,"The two-partner secretion pathway in Gram-negative bacteria consists of a TpsA exoprotein and a cognate TpsB outer membrane translocator protein. Previous work has demonstrated that the TpsB protein forms a β-barrel structure with pore forming activity and facilitates translocation of the TpsA protein across the outer membrane. In this study, we characterized the functional domains of the Haemophilus influenzae HMW1B protein, a TpsB protein that interacts with the H. influenzae HMW1 adhesin. Using c-Myc epitope tag insertions and cysteine substitution mutagenesis, we discovered that HMW1B contains an N-terminal surface-localized domain, an internal periplasmic domain, and a C-terminal membrane anchor. Functional and biochemical analysis of the c-Myc epitope tag insertions and a series of HMW1B deletion constructs demonstrated that the periplasmic domain is required for secretion of HMW1 and that the C-terminal membrane anchor (HMW1B-(234–545)) is capable of oligomerization and pore formation. Similar to our observations with HMW1B, examination of a Bordetella pertussis TpsB protein called FhaC revealed that the C terminus of FhaC (FhaC-(232–585)) is capable of pore formation. We speculate that all TpsB proteins have a modular structure, with a periplasmic domain that interacts with the cognate TpsA protein and with pore forming activity contained within the C terminus.

The best studied TpsA and TpsB pairs in the TPS family include filamentous hemagglutinin and FhaC of Bordetella pertussis, ShlA and ShlB of Serratia marcescens, and HMW1 and HMW1B of Haemophilus influenzae (2Schiebel E.

Microbiol. 1994; 11: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on experimental evidence and genomic sequence analysis, over 100 TpsA proteins have been identified to date. These proteins are present in a wide variety of bacterial species and are known or presumed virulence factors in all cases, generally functioning as adhesins or hemolysins (5Clantin B. Hodak H. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Villeret V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6194-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Most studies of the TPS pathway have focused on characterizing TpsA proteins, leaving important questions regarding the mechanism of activity of the TpsB proteins. According to the prevailing model for the TPS pathway, both the TpsA protein and the TpsB protein are delivered to the periplasm by the Sec apparatus. Subsequently, the TpsB protein inserts into the outer membrane and is believed to form a β-barrel with a central pore. The TpsA protein then interacts with the TpsB protein via a conserved N-terminal “secretion domain.” Following this interaction, the TpsA protein is translocated across the outer membrane, presumably through the TpsB pore. Interestingly, the TpsA secretion domain and the TpsB protein are not functionally interchangeable between unrelated TPS systems, suggesting that the interaction between TpsA and TpsB has a high level of specificity (6Jacob-Dubuisson F. Buisine C. Willery E. Renauld-Mongenie G. Locht C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 775-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current model, the TpsB protein has at least two distinct functions. First, the TpsB protein must recognize and interact with the secretion domain of the TpsA periplasmic intermediate. Second, the TpsB protein must form a pore to allow for secretion of the TpsA protein. Regarding these functions, previous work with FhaC, ShlB, and HMW1B has suggested that the entire TpsB sequence contributes to β-barrel formation with a total of 19–22 transmembrane β-strands and 9–11 periplasmic loops and that TpsB proteins form pores with a diameter of 1–3 nm (3St. Geme J.W.

HMW1 is synthesized as pre-pro-protein and undergoes two cleavage events prior to surface localization. First, amino acids 1–68 direct the pre-pro-protein to the Sec apparatus and are cleaved. Second, amino acids 69–441 (containing the TPS secretion domain) direct the pro-protein to HMW1B and are cleaved (3St. Geme J.W. Grass IIIS. Mol.

In this study, we characterized the functional domains of the H. influenzae HMW1B TpsB protein. We found that HMW1B has an extracellular N terminus, a large internal periplasmic domain, and a C-terminal membrane anchor with 10 predicted β-strands. Further analysis revealed that the periplasmic domain is required for recognition of HMW1 and that the C-terminal membrane anchor forms a tetrameric β-barrel with pore-forming ability important for translocation of HMW1. In additional work, we found that the C terminus of the B. pertussis FhaC TpsB protein (residues 232–584) was sufficient for pore forming activity, raising the possibility that all TpsB proteins have a modular structure with discrete domains involved in TpsA protein recognition and pore formation.

E. coli BL21(DE3)omp8 is a porindeficient strain that lacks outer membrane proteins OmpF, OmpC, OmpA, and LamB (16Prilipov A. Phale P.S. Van Gelder P. Rosenbusch J.P. Koebnik R.

Cloning vectors that were used in this study include pTrc99A (19Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 69: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), pHAT10 (Clontech), and pACYC184 (20Chang A.C. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strains were grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar or in LB broth and were stored at –80 °C in LB broth with 50% glycerol. Antibiotic concentrations used to select for plasmids include 100 μg ml–1 ampicillin and 30 μgml–1 chloramphenicol. Recombinant DNA Methods—DNA ligations, restriction endonuclease digestions, gel electrophoresis, and PCR were performed according to standard techniques (21Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2001; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). Plasmids were introduced into E. coli by electroporation (22Dower W.J. Miller J.F. Ragsdale C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). Construction of Plasmids Used in This Study—All plasmids in the pTrc:HMW1Bc-mycx series (where x indicates the residue preceding the c-Myc epitope) encode HMW1B with a c-Myc epitope tag insertion and were constructed in a similar manner. The plasmid pHMW1-15 was used as a template to amplify the coding sequence for HMW1B residues 1–x with an engineered KpnI site at the 5′ end and an engineered BamHI site at the 3′ end. In a separate reaction, the plasmid pHMW1-15 was used as a template to amplify the coding sequence for HMW1B residues (x+1)–545 with an engineered BamHI site and coding sequence for the c-Myc epitope at the 5′ end and an engineered XbaI site at the 3′ end. The resulting PCR products were digested with KpnI/BamHI and BamHI/XbaI, respectively, and were then ligated into KpnI-XbaI-digested pTrc99A. Ultimately, 21 different pTrc:HMW1Bc-mycx constructs were generated, with the c-Myc epitope inserted after residues 30, 55, 81, 95, 109, 141, 149, 157, 194, 218, 276, 298, 325, 352, 380, 420, 446, 466, 483, 504, and 526. Cysteine mutants were constructed in the pHAT::HMW1B backbone and were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ultimately, 27 different cysteine substitution mutants were generated as follows: A29C, S55C, S61C, I82C, T95C, S109C, S131C, S134C, S177C, G183C, S192C, T219C, S237C, G243C, S256C, S276C, L298C, S324C, T352C, H364C, S397C, S420C, S442C, A467C, S478C, T503C, and S532C. The plasmid pACYC::HMW1AC encodes HMW1A and HMW1C. To construct this plasmid, recombinant PCR was used to delete the entire hmw1B open reading frame in plasmid pHMW1-15, generating pHMW1AC. Subsequently, pHMW1AC was digested with XbaI/Sal, and the fragment containing hmw1A and hmw1C was ligated into XbaI-SalI-digested pACYC184. The plasmids pHAT::HMW1B27–545, pHAT::HMW1B107–545, pHAT::HMW1B121–545, and pHAT::HMW1B234–545 encode the Hia signal sequence, the HAT epitope, and the indicated HMW1B residues. To construct these plasmids, pHMW1-15 was used as a template to amplify the coding sequence for the relevant HMW1B residues, engineering a SalI site at the 5′ end and a BamHI site at the 3′ end. The resulting products were digested with SalI and BamHI and ligated into SalI-BamHI-digested pHAT::Hia1–49. The plasmids pHAT::FhaC31–585 and pHAT::FhaC232–585 encode the Hia signal sequence, the HAT epitope, and the indicated FhaC residues. To construct these plasmids, chromosomal DNA from B. pertussis strain Tohama I was used as template to amplify the coding sequence for the relevant FhaC residues, engineering a SalI site at the 5′ end and a BamHI site at the 3′ end. The resulting products were digested with SalI and BamHI and ligated into SalI-BamHI-digested pHAT::Hia1–49. All constructs were examined by nucleotide sequencing to ensure that PCR products were free of unintended mutations. Cell Fractionation and Protein Analysis—Whole-cell sonicates were prepared by resuspending bacterial pellets in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and sonicating to clarity. Outer membrane proteins were recovered on the basis of Sarkosyl insolubility as described by Carlone et al. (23Carlone G.M. Thomas M.L. Rumschlag H.S. Sottnek F.O. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1986; 24: 330-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For dot immunoblot analysis of outer membranes, aliquots of outer membrane protein preparations were applied to a nitrocellulose filter using a dot-blot manifold apparatus. Samples were incubated for 30 min and then pulled through the filter by vacuum suction. Protein was detected by a standard Western blot analysis. To assess extracellular secretion of HMW1-(69–441), cells were resuspended from a plate to an A600 of 0.6–0.9 and then diluted to an A600 of 0.3. After incubation at room temperature for 45 min, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and sonicated to clarity. Culture supernatants were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% (v/v), incubating for 10 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuging at 15,600 × g at 4° for 10 min. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were resuspended in 0.2 m Tris (pH 9.0) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were performed with a mouse monoclonal antiserum raised against the c-Myc epitope (monoclonal antibody 9E10; Roche Applied Science), a guinea pig polyclonal antiserum raised against HMW1 residues 1–591, a guinea pig polyclonal antiserum raised against the mature form of HMW1, or a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against HMW1B. Appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) were used, and detection of antibody reactivity was accomplished by incubation of the membrane in a chemiluminescent substrate solution (Pierce) and exposure to film. Site-directed Fluorescence Labeling—Site-directed fluorescence labeling of cysteine residue substitutions was carried out as described previously (24Henderson N.S. So S.S. Martin C. Kulkarni R. Thanassi D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53747-53754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli BL21(DE3) derivatives harboring pHAT10::HMW1B cysteine substitutions were resuspended from a plate to A600 ∼0.8, back diluted 1:25, and grown to A600 ∼1.0. Cells were harvested and resuspended in Buffer A (100 mm potassium sulfate, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0)) and divided into 2 equal aliquots. Freshly prepared 4-acetamido-4′-malemidylstilbene-2–2′disulfonic acid (AMS; Molecular Probes) was added to 1 aliquot to a final concentration of 100 μm. After incubation at 25 °C for 7 min, both aliquots were washed three times and resuspended in Buffer A. Oregon Green 488 maleimide (OGM, Molecular Probes) was added to both aliquots to a final concentration of 40 μm, and samples were incubated at 25 °C in the dark for 15 min. Reactions were quenched by addition of 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and samples were washed three times. Samples were resuspended in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) supplemented with Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science), and outer membrane proteins were prepared on the basis of Sarkosyl insolubility (23Carlone G.M. Thomas M.L. Rumschlag H.S. Sottnek F.O. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1986; 24: 330-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Outer membrane proteins were solubilized with 1% Elugent (Calbiochem), 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl by rocking overnight at 4 °C. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble outer membrane fraction was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min with Talon affinity resin (Clontech) pre-equilibrated with 1% Elugent, 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl. The Talon resin was washed three times, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved via SDS-PAGE. The fluorescence profile was obtained by scanning gels with a Typhoon 9410 Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences) utilizing the Blue Fam Laser Blue 2 (excitation wavelength of 488 nm). Fluorescent values for each band were obtained using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The same gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue and scanned using an Alpha Innotech MultiImager (San Leandro, CA), performing densitometry using the AlphaEase system software (San Leandro, CA). The fluorescence value for each HMW1B protein was normalized to its protein level as determined by Coomassie Blue staining. Subsequently, the fluorescence ratio (normalized OGM signal without AMS pretreatment divided by the normalized OGM signal with AMS pretreatment) was calculated for each HMW1B derivative to obtain the fold reduction in OGM labeling due to pretreatment to AMS. All HMW1B mutants were analyzed a minimum of three times. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using the z-test. Criteria for periplasmic residues included a fluorescence ratio ≤6 and a z-test value ≤0.05. Criteria for surface-localized residues included a fluorescence ratio ≥10 and a z-test value ≤0.05. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was performed as described previously (12Grass S. Buscher A.Z. Swords W.E. Apicella M.A. Barenkamp S.J. Ozchlewski N. J. W. St. GemeIII. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 737-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), using polyclonal antiserum raised against mature HMW1, a mouse monoclonal antiserum raised against the c-Myc epitope (monoclonal antibody 9E10; Roche Applied Science), or a mouse antiserum against the HAT epitope. Adherence Assays—Adherence assays were performed with Chang epithelial cells (Wong-Kilbourne derivative, clone 1-5c-4, human conjunctiva; ATCC CCL20.2) as described previously (18St. Geme J.W.

Protein Purification—HMW1B-(234–545) was purified using the conditions for purifying wild type HMW1B, as described previously (10Surana N.K. Grass S. Hardy G.G. Li H. Thanassi D.G. J. W. GemeIII. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14497-14502Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, outer membrane proteins from overnight cultures of BL21(DE3)omp8::pHAT:HMW1B234–545 were recovered on the basis of Sarkosyl insolubility (23Carlone G.M. Thomas M.L. Rumschlag H.S. Sottnek F.O. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1986; 24: 330-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Outer membrane proteins were solubilized with 1% Elugent (Calbiochem), 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl by rocking for 1 h at 25°C. The insoluble outer membrane fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The soluble outer membrane fraction was loaded onto a column containing Talon beads (Clontech) and equilibrated with 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM), 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl. HMW1B-(234–545) was purified using a linear gradient of imidazole. The fractions containing HMW1B-(234–545) were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 10 concentrator (Millipore) and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated previously with 0.1% DDM, 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl. Fractions containing HMW1B-(234–545) were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 10 concentrator (Millipore). The N-terminal β-barrel domain of OmpA was purified in a similar manner, starting with a culture of BL21(DE3) harboring pHAT::P-49/OmpA21–191. Heat Modifiability Assay—Samples were incubated in sample buffer for 5 min at either 25 or 100 °C prior to loading on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C using pre-cooled running buffer (0.1% SDS, 25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine). Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were obtained on a Jasco 600 CD spectrophotometer using a quartz cell with a 0.1-cm path length. Purified HMW1B-(234–545) was used at a concentration of 0.15 mg/ml. Five scans were performed at room temperature, and the contribution of buffer alone was subtracted. Secondary structure content was estimated using the CDSSTR algorithm on the DICHROWEB website (25Lobley A. Whitmore L.

Liposome Swelling Assay—Liposome swelling assays were performed as described previously (10Surana N.K. Grass S. Hardy G.G. Li H. Thanassi D.G. J. W. GemeIII. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Antibiotic Susceptibility Assay—Antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli strains was determined using the standard disk diffusion technique (28Bauer A.W. Kirby W.M. Sherris J.C. Turck M. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1966; 45: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (12341) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria were resuspended in LB broth to an A600 of 0.3 and were inoculated onto a 150 × 15-mm plate with a sterile cotton swab to form a lawn of bacteria. Blank, 6-mm sterile disks (BD Biosciences) were placed on top of the agar and were supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic. The following compounds were used in the assay: chloramphenicol, 30 μg; rifampicin, 5 μg; and vancomycin, 30 μg. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the diameter of the zone of inhibition around each disk was measured. In all cases, zones of inhibition were at least 6 mm, reflecting the diameter of the disks. Data were analyzed using the Student's t test to determine statistical differences between groups, requiring a probability level of 0.05 for significance. HMW1B Has Multiple Domains—In previous work, secondary structure analysis of HMW1B suggested a model with 22 transmembrane β-strands (3St. Geme J.W. Grass IIIS. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To validate this model, we elected to map the topology of HMW1B experimentally. As a first step, we inserted the c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) in predicted periplasmic and extracellular loops, ultimately creating 21 different constructs with insertions in 18 of the predicted 22 loops (see Fig. 1). These constructs were then introduced into E. coli DH5α, allowing assessment of outer membrane fractions for the effect of the insertions on HMW1B stability and examination of whole bacteria for surface localization of the c-Myc epitope. Outer membrane fractions were analyzed by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antiserum raised against HMW1B and by nondenaturing dot immunoblot assays using either an antiserum against HMW1B or an antibody against the c-Myc epitope. In addition, whole bacteria were examined by flow cytometry using an antibody against the c-Myc epitope. Criteria for concluding that the c-Myc epitope was surface-localized included detection of the tagged HMW1B protein in the outer membrane at wild type levels, detection of the c-Myc epitope by dot immunoblot analysis of outer membranes, and detection of the c-Myc epitope by flow cytometry. If the recombinant protein was present in the outer membrane at wild type levels and the c-Myc epitope was detectable by dot immunoblot analysis of outer membranes but was not detectable by flow cytometry, we concluded that the c-Myc epitope was on the periplasmic side of the outer membrane. If the recombinant protein was present in the outer membrane at wild type levels but was not detectable with an antibody against the c-Myc epitope by dot immunoblot analysis of outer membranes, we concluded that the location of the c-Myc epitope was ambiguous. As summarized in Fig. 1 and supplementary Table I, 17 of the 21 tagged proteins were expressed. Among these 17 proteins, the c-Myc epitope was localized on the bacterial surface in 6, in the periplasm in 6, and in an ambiguous location in 5. To complement these results, we generated a recombinant protein with the HAT epitope at the immediate N terminus of mature HMW1B (HAT-HMW1B-(27–545)) and then expressed this protein in E. coli DH5α. Based on flow cytometry, the HAT epitope in DH5α/pHAT-HMW1B-(27–545) was detectable on the bacterial surface (data not shown). Although tagging with the c-Myc epitope and the HAT epitope provided helpful information regarding the topology of HMW1B, this approach was not sufficient to generate a full topology map. As an additional strategy to map the HMW1B surface and periplasmic loops, we employed site-directed fluorescence labeling, a technique that uses small molecule thiol-reactive fluorescent (OGM) and nonfluorescent (AMS) probes differing in their ability to cross the E. coli outer membrane. This method relies on the fact that OGM is readily permeable across the outer membrane, labeling surface and periplasmic thiol groups equally well. In contrast, AMS crosses the outer membrane very slowly. Therefore, when used to pre-treat cells, AMS blocks OGM labeling of surface thiol groups. Given that mature HMW1B contains no cysteine residues, we substituted cysteine residues at 27 positions in HMW1B, corresponding to 21 of the 22 predicted loops. Twenty five of the 27 mutant proteins were produced at wild type levels, and the remaining two mutant proteins were not detectable (suggesting degradation) (supplemental Table II). Four of the cysteine substitution residues did not label with OGM without solubilization of the protein from the outer membrane and therefore provided no information regarding HMW1B topology (supplemental Table II). Based on measurement of fluorescence ratios and calculations of statistical significance, eight substitution mutations were clearly localized to the periplasm, and five substitution mutations were clearly localized to the surface (Fig. 1 and suppleme"
https://openalex.org/W2084141510,"Activation of G protein-coupled receptors like the β1-adrenergic receptor results in conformational changes that ultimately lead to signal propagation through a G protein to an effector like adenylyl cyclase. In this study we identified amino acids that seem to be critical for activation of the human β1-adrenergic receptor. Activation patterns of mutant receptors were analyzed using two structurally different ligands for β-adrenergic receptors that both are mixed agonist/antagonists. Broxaterol and terbutaline are agonists at β2- and β3-receptors; however, they act as antagonists at the β1-subtype. We reasoned that this functional selectivity may be reflected by a corresponding sequence pattern in the receptor subtypes. Therefore, we exchanged single amino acids of the β1-adrenergic receptor for residues that were identical in the β2- and β3-subtypes but different in the β1-receptor. Pharmacological characterization of such receptor mutants revealed that binding of a panel of agonists and antagonists including broxaterol and terbutaline was unaltered. However, two of the mutants (I185V and D212N) were activated by broxaterol and terbutaline, which acted as antagonists at the wild-type receptor. Two additional mutants (V120L and K253R) could be activated by terbutaline alone, which is structurally more closely related to endogenous catecholamines like epinephrine than to broxaterol. A model of the human β1-adrenergic receptor showed that the four gain-of-function mutations are outside of the putative ligand-binding domain substantiating the lack of an effect of the mutations on binding characteristics. These results support the notion that Val-120, Ile-185, Asp-212, and Lys-253 are critically involved in conformational changes occurring during receptor activation.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; [125I]CYP, (–)-3-[125I]iodocyanopindolol; TM, transmembrane domain; E2 loop, second extracellular loop. 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; [125I]CYP, (–)-3-[125I]iodocyanopindolol; TM, transmembrane domain; E2 loop, second extracellular loop. comprise a large number of structurally related membrane receptors, many of which are important drug targets. Among the receptors targeted in established therapies β-adrenergic receptors comprise one of the most important subgroups. The use of β-blockers is indicated in virtually all major cardiovascular diseases, whereas β2-selective agonists are a mainstay in the treatment of asthma. Activation of GPCRs is a complex process that results in a state that propagates a signal to the corresponding G protein. It is thought that more than one activated state may exist (1Baker J.G. Hall I.P. Hill S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1312-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 2Alves I.D. Cowell S.M. Salamon Z. Devanathan S. Tollin G. Hruby V.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) providing a basis for transduction of different ligand-specific signals via a given receptor subtype (3Konkar A.A. Zhu Z. Granneman J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 82: 3144-3148Google Scholar). The notion that receptor activation is a multistep process whereby the receptor assumes a series of conformational intermediates provides an explanation for such functionally distinct states (4Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1060-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Such functionally defined states could serve as distinct mediators of more specific drug actions. The investigation of conformational intermediates should benefit from ligands that are able to distinguish their functional identity. Alternatively it would be interesting to study distinct activation patterns at closely related receptor subtypes that might be different for a given ligand. Recently we have discovered that some ligands exhibit distinct functional properties at the three subtypes of β-adrenergic receptors. In the course of a previous project for the development of subtype-selective ligands for human β-adrenergic receptors we noticed that the experimental compound broxaterol, which is thought to be a β2-selective agonist, binds in fact with the same affinity to all three β-receptor subtypes (5Conti P. Dallanoce C. De Amici M. De Micheli C. Klotz K.-N. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Hoffmann C. Leitz M.R. Oberdorf-Maass S. Lohse M.J. Klotz K.-N. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Interestingly this compound turned out to be an agonist at β2- and β3-receptors but an antagonist at the β1-receptor (5Conti P. Dallanoce C. De Amici M. De Micheli C. Klotz K.-N. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Hoffmann C. Leitz M.R. Oberdorf-Maass S. Lohse M.J. Klotz K.-N. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) making it a β2-/β3-selective agonist in functional terms, although it does not bind selectively to these subtypes. In a recent study we found similar functional β2 selectivity for clinically used compounds including terbutaline and salbutamol (6Hoffmann C. Leitz M.R. Oberdorf-Maass S. Lohse M.J. Klotz K.-N. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This discovery prompted us to undertake the present investigation where we generated several gain-of-function mutants of the β1-adrenergic receptors that are activated by compounds like broxaterol and terbutaline. Based on the close sequence similarity between β-adrenergic receptor subtypes we reasoned that the functional selectivity of such compounds may have a corresponding sequence pattern in amino acids that are identical in β2- and β3but different in the β1-subtype. Sequence comparison of the entire receptor proteins revealed a total of 17 amino acids following this pattern with eight of these positions being located in transmembrane domains. We generated six mutants where a β1 amino acid was substituted for the corresponding β2-/β3 amino acid, and the functional characteristics of these mutants were analyzed. For mutation of such positions functionally different regions were selected. As the putative ligand-binding domain is embedded in the transmembrane domains (7Wieland K. Zuurmond H.M. Krasel C.

Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) several mutations were introduced in transmembrane regions. The two mutants L154V and K253R are at the interface between transmembrane domains and intracellular loops two and three, respectively, which are thought to be involved in receptor-G protein coupling (9Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Mutant D212N is located in the second extracellular (E2) loop in a position that has been shown to be relevant for ligand-receptor interaction in other GPCRs (10Hoffmann C. Moro S. Nicholas R.A.

Fourgain-of-function mutants were found that showed distinct ligand-dependent changes of activation patterns. Our data including a receptor model suggest that we have identified amino acid residues outside the ligand-binding domain that are critical for the activation of human β1-adrenergic receptors.

After confirmation of the mutation, the PCR products were digested with the appropriate enzymes and cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 containing the wild-type β1-adrenergic receptor cDNA to obtain full-length mutated β1-adrenergic receptors. The sequences of all resultant cDNAs were verified by automated sequencing. The cDNA of the β2-adrenergic receptor (16Schofield P.R. Rhee L.M. Peralta E.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 15: 3636Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number Y00106) was cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector as described earlier (6Hoffmann C. Leitz M.R.

Cell Culture and Membrane Preparation—Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with human β-adrenergic receptor subtypes and different mutants of the β1-adrenergic receptor, respectively, were grown and split in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with nutrient mixture F12 as described before (6Hoffmann C.

Before cells were harvested the culture medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Then membranes were prepared, or cells were frozen on the dishes for later preparation of membranes. Crude membrane fractions were prepared from fresh (measurement of adenylyl cyclase) or frozen cells (radioligand binding) according to two different protocols, which have been described recently (14Klotz K.-N.

The resulting membrane pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, at a final protein concentration of 1–2 mg/ml. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (17Bradford M.

Several slightly different models were calculated by varying the initial parameters, and the variability and energy among these models was used to estimate the lower limit of the error in the corresponding regions of the fold. The models obtained were submitted to the PROCHECK package for the structure evaluation (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Ligand Docking—The AutoDock 3.0 program was used to perform an automatic docking exploration for different conformations of the ligand in the β1 models (28Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9142) Google Scholar). This automated docking program uses a grid-based method for energy calculation of the flexible ligand in complex with a rigid protein. Points on the three-dimensional grid are placed such that they cover the entire inner cavity of the β1-adrenergic receptor and are probed with the atoms that constitute the ligand. The docking experiments explored the interaction of terbutaline with the binding region of β1-subtype. The simulation was carried out within a 22-Å cube using a 0.375-Å grid spacing. AutoDock uses an adaptive global-local search method based on Lamarckian genetics (LGA) in conjunction with an empirical force field that allows the prediction of binding free energies for docked ligand. In our setup we used a starting population of 50 ligand conformations with a stopping criterion of a maximum of 10 million energy evaluations. The number of dockings was set to 250 to get good statistics of the docked complex, and the resulting bound states were clustered in groups on the basis of a root mean square deviation of 0.5 Å relative to the initial starting position of the ligand. These numbers together with the default parameters of AutoDock have been shown to be a useful setting for blind docking (29Hetényi C. von der Spoel D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). From the 250 simulations performed the binding modes with the most populated clusters was selected. Fig. 1 shows a sequence comparison documenting the high sequence identity of the human β-adrenergic receptor subtypes in particular in the transmembrane domains. Broxaterol and terbutaline activate only β2- and β3-receptors as opposed to agonists like isoproterenol and fenoterol, which activate all three subtypes of β-receptors. Therefore, amino acids that are shared between the β2- and β3-adrenergic receptors but are different in the β1-subtype were investigated to determine their importance for the specific activation pattern of broxaterol and terbutaline. In Fig. 1 respective amino acids are emphasized with a box. Mutation of such amino acids in the β1-receptor to the corresponding amino acid of the β2/β3-subtypes was accomplished by a PCR approach (see “Experimental Procedures”). A selection of the sites following this pattern was chosen for mutation (Fig. 1, arrows, and Table 1). The functional characteristics of the mutated receptors were investigated in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with mutant and wild-type receptors. Fig. 2A shows that broxaterol did not stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity via β1-receptors but had partial agonistic activity at the β2-subtype as has been shown before (5Conti P. Dallanoce C. De Amici M. De Micheli C. Klotz K.-N. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Hoffmann C. Leitz M.R. Oberdorf-Maass S. Lohse M.J. Klotz K.-N. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The β1-receptor mutants V120L, L154V, K253R, and F362L behaved like the wild-type receptor as broxaterol did not mediate a stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. In contrast, broxaterol did stimulate adenylyl cyclase via mutants I185V located in TM4 and D212N in the second extracellular loop (Fig. 2A). The stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity mediated by these gain-of-function mutants was comparable to the stimulation achieved by the full agonist isoproterenol. In addition to broxaterol we tested the efficacy of terbutaline, which is another compound that has shown a mixed β1-antagonist/β2-/β3-agonist profile (6Hoffmann C. Leitz M.R. Oberdorf-Maass S. Lohse M.J. Klotz K.-N. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B confirms the minimal efficacy of terbutaline at the β1-adrenergic receptor (19% compared with isoproterenol) and near full efficacy at the β2-receptor. Terbutaline behaved similarly to broxaterol at the β1-receptor mutants L154V and F362L as it showed an identical minimal functional response at these mutants as well as at the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2B). The mutants I185V and D212N mediated a stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by terbutaline; this is in correspondence to the agonistic activity shown for broxaterol at these mutants. In contrast to the structurally different compound broxaterol, terbutaline activated adenylyl cyclase also via the mutants V120L, which is at the extracellular end of TM2, and K253R, which is located at the cytoplasmic face of TM5 (Fig. 2B). Again the efficacy of terbutaline at these mutants was similar to isoproterenol. All gain-of-function mutants showed the same or a slightly lower basal activity compared with the β1 wild type (see “Experimental Procedures”). The mutant β1-adrenergic receptors were tested for their binding characteristics and expression levels. Table 1 shows that wild-type β1- and β2-receptors and all mutant β1-receptors bound the nonselective antagonist [125I]CYP with similar KD values. Also the expression levels of the cell lines studied were in the same order of magnitude excluding that the observed gain of function may be a result of massive overexpression of the respective mutant receptor. As a next step it was confirmed that the mutations leading to activation by broxaterol or terbutaline did not cause a pharmacological conversion of β1- into β2- (or β3-) adrenergic receptors. One of the main characteristics of β2-adrenergic receptors is the low affinity for norepinephrine compared with epinephrine, whereas the β1-subtype does not distinguish between these two endogenous catecholamines. In contrast, the β3-subtype shows a marked preference for norepinephrine over epinephrine. Table 2 shows that all mutants clearly maintained the pharmacological identity of a wild-type β1-adrenergic receptor.TABLE 2Affinity of epinephrine and norepinephrine at wild-type human β1- and β2-receptors and functionally altered mutants of the β1-adrenergic receptorEpinephrineNorepinephrineβ1aValues are from Ref. 6.4,000 (2,800-5,500)3,600 (2,400-5,200)β2aValues are from Ref. 6.700 (500-1,000)26,000 (23,000-30,000)β3aValues are from Ref. 6.130,000 (120,000-140,000)4,000 (2,800-5,500)V120L5,400 (2,700-10,700)2,100 (1,100-3,800)I185V5,600 (3,600-8,700)3,800 (1,400-10,400)D212N4,500 (3,400-5,900)2,600 (1,900-3,600)K253R6,900 (2,800-17,000)3,100 (1,000-9,300)a Values are from Ref. 6Hoffmann C.

Open table in a new tab In addition, more detailed competition studies were performed with a panel of agonists that confirmed that the mutants share all their pharmacological characteristics with the wild-type β1-receptor (Table 3). The affinity of some prototypical subtype-selective antagonists was also not affected by any of the mutations introduced into the β1 sequence (Table 3). The three-dimensional model of the β1-adrenergic receptor in Fig. 3A shows the location of the mutations that changed the functional responses to broxaterol and terbutaline. The model is based on the crystal structure of rhodopsin (21Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar) and was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In Fig. 3B some amino acids thought to be involved in agonist recognition are shown. These amino acids were identified previously as critical for agonist binding in models for both β1- (30Rezmann-Vitti L.A. Louis S.N.S. Nero T.L. Jackman G.P. Iakovidis D. Machida C.A. Louis W.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 675-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and β2-receptors (7Wieland K. Zuurmond H.M. Krasel C. IJzerman A.P. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9276-9281Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 8Isogaya M. Sugimoto Y. Tanimura R. Tanaka R. Kikkawa H. Nagao T. Kurose H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, terbutaline is docked into the putative binding site of the receptor. The docking of terbutaline was simulated with various starting positions, but independent of the starting conditions about a quarter of the obtained structures fitted to the same position (root mean square deviation, 0.5 Å). The model suggests that all mutated amino acids are too far away from the binding pocket to be directly implicated in ligand binding. The closest distance between the ligand and a mutated amino acid in the transmembrane region of 7.7 Å is found between terbutaline and Ile-185. Recently it was found that not only the experimental drug broxaterol but, surprisingly, also compounds used clinically such as terbutaline bind nonselectively to human β-receptors. However, they exhibit functional selectivity as they act as agonists only at β2- and β3-adrenergic receptors, whereas they are antagonists at the β1-subtype (5Conti P. Dallanoce C. De Amici M. De Micheli C. Klotz K.-N. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Hoffmann C. Leitz M.R. Oberdorf-Maass S. Lohse M.J. Klotz K.-N. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2004; 369: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The lack of binding selectivity of such compounds suggests that their interaction with the ligand-binding domain does not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed functional differences at β-adrenergic receptor subtypes. There seem to exist common features of the ligand-binding domains that dictate the binding affinity. However, it may be reasonable to assume that receptor activation is additionally controlled by subtype-specific sequence patterns of amino acids outside the ligand-binding domain. Therefore, nonselective ligands that are mixed agonist/antagonists like broxaterol or terbutaline should be interesting tools to study receptor activation. Based on the high sequence identity between the subtypes of β-adrenergic receptors it seemed possible to determine amino acids that are responsible for the subtype-specific activation patterns of broxaterol and terbutaline. Such positions should play a prominent role in receptor activation in general. We reasoned that the observed functional pattern for mixed agonists/antagonists might be reflected by a corresponding sequence pattern in the three β-adrenergic receptor subtypes. The gain-of-function mutants of the β1-receptor that were found in the course of this study confirm this initial hypothesis. Several of the generated mutants showed altered functional characteristics compared with the wild-type β1-adrenergic receptor. It can be excluded that these changes are caused by a decrease in structural constraints as all gain-of-function mutants showed the same or a slightly lower basal activity compared with the β1 wild type. Interestingly we found two β1 mutants at which broxaterol turned into an agonist, whereas for terbutaline two additional gain-of-function mutations were identified. Broxaterol is an unusual β-agonist as it does not share a catechol or related structural motif with the endogenous ligands epinephrine and norepinephrine or most typical β-adrenergic agonists. It seems reasonable, therefore, that more gain-of-function mutants were found for terbutaline than for broxaterol as the catechol and related structures are important for receptor activation (31Swaminath G. Deupi X. Lee T.W. Zhu W. Thian F.S. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22465-22471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (239) Google Scholar). One obvious explanation for the functional effect of exchanging amino acids in the β1-receptor for β2 or β3 residues would be a change of the pharmacological characteristics and a concomitantly altered activation pattern. Our data clearly showed that the mutated β1-receptors are pharmacologically absolutely identical with the wild-type receptor. Closer investigation with a number of subtype-selective agonists and antagonists confirmed that all mutants independent of their activation by broxaterol or terbutaline are pharmacologically indistinguishable from wild-type β1-receptors. The receptor model shown in Fig. 3 also suggests that the mutations did not alter the ligand binding pocket. Therefore, our data provide evidence that single amino acids in various positions that do not seem to be involved in ligand recognition are decisive for the agonistic properties of a receptor ligand. Overall the number of mutations of the β1-adrenergic receptor reported in the literature is rather limited compared with numerous mutations of the β2-receptor. A number of mutations turning β1-receptors into constitutively active receptors have been described (32Lattion A.-L. Abuin L. Nenninger-Tosato M. Cotecchia S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A polymorphism of the human β1-subtype with functional consequences is known in position 389 (33Mason D.A. Moore J.D. Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12670-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). It turned out that an Arg in position 389 is more common than the Gly originally identified as the amino acid in the wild-type receptor. The variant with an Arg-389 is functionally different from the wild type as it shows both higher basal and isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity based on enhanced Gs coupling (33Mason D.A. Moore J.D. Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12670-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, so far there were no β1-receptor mutants known to turn an antagonist into an agonist. Activation of a GPCR is thought to be associated with conformational changes in the receptor protein. Current concepts suggest that after initial contact between an agonist and the ligand-binding domain a multistep process guides the receptor through a series of conformational intermediates (4Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1060-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 34Swaminath G. Xiang Y. Lee T.W. Steenhuis J. Parnot C. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 686-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Different conformational states may be responsible for the selective activation of signaling cascades mediated through different G proteins as in the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor (35Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). They may also be the basis for functionally distinct responses to different concentrations of a ligand as has been shown for CGP 12177 and other compounds (3Konkar A.A. Zhu Z. Granneman J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 82: 3144-3148Google Scholar). It is clear that any motion in the receptor protein resulting in conformational changes requires the existence of hinges or pivots to allow for structural changes to occur. In addition to amino acids responsible for ligand-receptor interaction other critical amino acids should exist that act as key points for such motion. It is not surprising, therefore, that mutations of amino acids that are not involved in ligand recognition may have effects on receptor function. Although we do not know the exact mechanism that underlies the functional changes caused by mutation it is obvious, however, that residues Val-120, Ile-185, Asp-212, and Lys-253 play a critical role in the activation of the human β1-adrenergic receptor. Isogaya et al. (8Isogaya M. Sugimoto Y. Tanimura R. Tanaka R. Kikkawa H. Nagao T. Kurose H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) describe a number of mutations including mutation of Val-120, which is one of the positions that led to a gain-of-function mutation in our study. The mutation of Val-120 to Ala shows an indirect contribution to subtype selectivity of selected agonists (8Isogaya M. Sugimoto Y. Tanimura R. Tanaka R. Kikkawa H. Nagao T. Kurose H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although ligand binding was not affected in our study we also found that activation by terbutaline, but not by broxaterol, was changed by mutation of Val-120 to Leu in our case, confirming a significant role of this position. A number of studies suggest that the E2 loop plays an important role in ligand binding and receptor activation at least in some GPCRs (10Hoffmann C. Moro S. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14639-14647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Shi L. Javitch J.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 12Shi L. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 13Klco J.M. Wiegand C.B. Narzinski K. Baranski T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2005; 12: 320-326Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our data support this notion as the D212N mutant showed a functional change compared with the wild-type receptor as it could be activated by both broxaterol and terbutaline. A number of mutations in the E2 loop of the C5a receptor result in constitutive activity; therefore, a role as a negative regulator of receptor activation has been proposed for the E2 loop (13Klco J.M. Wiegand C.B. Narzinski K. Baranski T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2005; 12: 320-326Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Position Asp-212 in the human β1-adrenergic receptor does not seem to function in such a way as the mutation to Asn did not result in a change in basal receptor activity. In the case of the dopamine D2 receptor a contribution of the E2 loop to the ligand binding site has been suggested (12Shi L. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In particular our binding data led us to conclude that Asp-212 is not directly involved in ligand binding as the D212N mutation like all other mutations presented in this study did not affect agonist or antagonist binding. All functionally changed mutants including the D212N mutation support the concept that amino acids outside the ligand-binding domain contribute relevant structural elements for receptor activation and thus for ligand efficacy. The model of the human β1-adrenergic receptor shows that the gain-of-function mutants described here are very unlikely to be close enough to the docked ligand terbutaline to directly interfere with ligand-receptor interaction. Further confirmation of this notion comes from the absolutely unaffected pharmacological characteristics of all functionally significant mutants investigated in our study. The mutations affect residues outside the ligand-binding domain and reveal, therefore, that the respective amino acids contribute to the control of the activation process independently of ligand-receptor recognition. It turned out that the ligands broxaterol and terbutaline, which are nonselective in binding but functionally selective, are ideal pharmacological tools to analyze the activation process in conjunction with point mutation and receptor modeling. In summary, we present data revealing an important role of Val-120, Ile-185, Asp-212, and Lys-253 for the activation of the human β1-adrenergic receptor. The mutation of these positions to the corresponding amino acids of the β2-/β3-subtype resulted in a gain of function as the β1-antagonists broxaterol and terbutaline turned into agonists at these mutants. We conclude that the mutated positions represent critical residues for conformational changes that occur during receptor activation. This notion is supported by a receptor model suggesting that the amino acids mutated in this study are not involved in direct ligand-receptor recognition. We appreciate the expert technical assistance of Nico Falgner, Sonja Kachler, and Silke Oberdorf-Maass."
