https://openalex.org/W2339406441,"Bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs) form a network of blood vessels that regulate both leukocyte trafficking and haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) maintenance. However, it is not clear how BMECs balance these dual roles, and whether these events occur at the same vascular site. We found that mammalian bone marrow stem cell maintenance and leukocyte trafficking are regulated by distinct blood vessel types with different permeability properties. Less permeable arterial blood vessels maintain haematopoietic stem cells in a low reactive oxygen species (ROS) state, whereas the more permeable sinusoids promote HSPC activation and are the exclusive site for immature and mature leukocyte trafficking to and from the bone marrow. A functional consequence of high permeability of blood vessels is that exposure to blood plasma increases bone marrow HSPC ROS levels, augmenting their migration and differentiation, while compromising their long-term repopulation and survival. These findings may have relevance for clinical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and mobilization protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2336155947,"Neural activity maintains representations that bridge past and future events, often over many seconds. Network models can produce persistent and ramping activity, but the positive feedback that is critical for these slow dynamics can cause sensitivity to perturbations. Here we use electrophysiology and optogenetic perturbations in the mouse premotor cortex to probe the robustness of persistent neural representations during motor planning. We show that preparatory activity is remarkably robust to large-scale unilateral silencing: detailed neural dynamics that drive specific future movements were quickly and selectively restored by the network. Selectivity did not recover after bilateral silencing of the premotor cortex. Perturbations to one hemisphere are thus corrected by information from the other hemisphere. Corpus callosum bisections demonstrated that premotor cortex hemispheres can maintain preparatory activity independently. Redundancy across selectively coupled modules, as we observed in the premotor cortex, is a hallmark of robust control systems. Network models incorporating these principles show robustness that is consistent with data."

Here we study spatial symmetries that translate the origin by a fraction of the lattice period, and find that these non-symmorphic symmetries protect an exotic surface fermion whose dispersion relation is shaped like an hourglass; surface bands connect one hourglass to the next in an unbreakable zigzag pattern. These ‘hourglass’ fermions are formed in the large-gap insulators, KHgX (X = As, Sb, Bi), which we propose as the first material class whose band topology relies on non-symmorphic symmetries. Besides the hourglass fermion, another surface of KHgX manifests a three-dimensional generalization of the quantum spin Hall effect, which has previously been observed only in two-dimensional crystals. To describe the bulk topology of non-symmorphic crystals, we propose a non-Abelian generalization of the geometric theory of polarization. Our non-trivial topology originates from an inversion of the rotational quantum numbers, which we propose as a criterion in the search for topological materials. The energy–momentum relationship of certain fermions resembles an hourglass, which is movable but unremovable; this robust property follows from the intertwining of spatial symmetries with the band theory of crystals, revised with mathematical connections to topology and cohomology. The spatial symmetry of a crystal can be defined by how the spatial origin is translated — by a lattice period or by a fraction of the lattice period. Recent work suggests that the latter 'non-symmorphic' type crystals could be of significant interest, as they would have interesting non-trivial topological properties. Andrei Bernevig and colleagues discuss how the geometric symmetries of non-symmorphic materials could give rise to a new class of topologically protected electronic features, and in particular find that band insulators KHgX (where X is As, Sb or Bi) are promising candidates in which to observe these properties."
https://openalex.org/W2337668972,"Blood vessels define local microenvironments in the skeletal system, play crucial roles in osteogenesis and provide niches for haematopoietic stem cells. The properties of niche-forming vessels and their changes in the ageing organism remain incompletely understood. Here we show that Notch signalling in endothelial cells leads to the expansion of haematopoietic stem cell niches in bone, which involves increases in CD31-positive capillaries and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ)-positive perivascular cells, arteriole formation and elevated levels of cellular stem cell factor. Although endothelial hypoxia-inducible factor signalling promotes some of these changes, it fails to enhance vascular niche function because of a lack of arterialization and expansion of PDGFRβ-positive cells. In ageing mice, niche-forming vessels in the skeletal system are strongly reduced but can be restored by activation of endothelial Notch signalling. These findings indicate that vascular niches for haematopoietic stem cells are part of complex, age-dependent microenvironments involving multiple cell populations and vessel subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2339469480,"A combination of photoredox and asymmetric organic catalysis enables enantioselective radical conjugate additions to β,β-disubstituted cyclic enones to construct quaternary carbon stereocentres with high fidelity. Quaternary stereogenic centres — carbon atoms with four distinct carbon substituents attached — are found in many biologically active natural products. A central goal of modern organic chemistry is to develop new catalytic enantioselective carbon–carbon bond-forming strategies that can be used to generate such centres. These authors demonstrate how a combination of photoredox and asymmetric organic catalysis enables enantioselective radical conjugate additions to β,β-disubstituted cyclic enones to set quaternary carbon stereocentres with high fidelity. This method appears to be the first application of iminium ion activation, a successful catalytic strategy for enantioselective polar chemistry, in the realm of radical reactivity. An important goal of modern organic chemistry is to develop new catalytic strategies for enantioselective carbon–carbon bond formation that can be used to generate quaternary stereogenic centres. Whereas considerable advances have been achieved by exploiting polar reactivity1, radical transformations have been far less successful2. This is despite the fact that open-shell intermediates are intrinsically primed for connecting structurally congested carbons, as their reactivity is only marginally affected by steric factors3. Here we show how the combination of photoredox4 and asymmetric organic catalysis5 enables enantioselective radical conjugate additions to β,β-disubstituted cyclic enones to obtain quaternary carbon stereocentres with high fidelity. Critical to our success was the design of a chiral organic catalyst, containing a redox-active carbazole moiety, that drives the formation of iminium ions and the stereoselective trapping of photochemically generated carbon-centred radicals by means of an electron-relay mechanism. We demonstrate the generality of this organocatalytic radical-trapping strategy with two sets of open-shell intermediates, formed through unrelated light-triggered pathways from readily available substrates and photoredox catalysts—this method represents the application of iminium ion activation6 (a successful catalytic strategy for enantioselective polar chemistry) within the realm of radical reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2339240569,"Somatic mutations are the driving force of cancer genome evolution. The rate of somatic mutations appears to be greatly variable across the genome due to variations in chromatin organization, DNA accessibility and replication timing. However, other variables that may influence the mutation rate locally are unknown, such as a role for DNA-binding proteins, for example. Here we demonstrate that the rate of somatic mutations in melanomas is highly increased at active transcription factor binding sites and nucleosome embedded DNA, compared to their flanking regions. Using recently available excision-repair sequencing (XR-seq) data, we show that the higher mutation rate at these sites is caused by a decrease of the levels of nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity. Our work demonstrates that DNA-bound proteins interfere with the NER machinery, which results in an increased rate of DNA mutations at the protein binding sites. This finding has important implications for our understanding of mutational and DNA repair processes and in the identification of cancer driver mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2338271148,"Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems insert spacers derived from viruses and other parasitic DNA elements into CRISPR loci to provide sequence-specific immunity. This frequently results in high within-population spacer diversity, but it is unclear if and why this is important. Here we show that, as a result of this spacer diversity, viruses can no longer evolve to overcome CRISPR-Cas by point mutation, which results in rapid virus extinction. This effect arises from synergy between spacer diversity and the high specificity of infection, which greatly increases overall population resistance. We propose that the resulting short-lived nature of CRISPR-dependent bacteria-virus coevolution has provided strong selection for the evolution of sophisticated virus-encoded anti-CRISPR mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2283279811,"Scanned Josephson tunnelling microscopy is used to image Cooper pair tunnelling from a superconducting microscope tip to the quantum condensate of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x, thus revealing the spatially modulated density of Cooper pairs predicted from several theories of the cuprate pseudogap phase. The conventional view of superconductivity is that it occurs when pairs of electrons of opposite momentum and spin bind to form a new zero-momentum quantum state called a Cooper pair. In theory, such pairs can exist with finite momentum, thereby generating states with spatially modulating density of Cooper pairs. Such a state has been created in ultracold lithium-6 gas, although it has hitherto not been seen in a superconductor. Here Séamus Davis and colleagues use Josephson tunnelling microscopy to image Cooper pair tunnelling from a superconducting microscope tip to the quantum condensate of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x, thus demonstrating the spatially modulated density of Cooper pairs as predicted. The quantum condensate of Cooper pairs forming a superconductor was originally conceived as being translationally invariant. In theory, however, pairs can exist with finite momentum Q, thus generating a state with a spatially modulated Cooper-pair density1,2. Such a state has been created in ultracold 6Li gas3 but never observed directly in any superconductor. It is now widely hypothesized that the pseudogap phase4 of the copper oxide superconductors contains such a ‘pair density wave’ state5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21. Here we report the use of nanometre-resolution scanned Josephson tunnelling microscopy22,23,24 to image Cooper pair tunnelling from a d-wave superconducting microscope tip to the condensate of the superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. We demonstrate condensate visualization capabilities directly by using the Cooper-pair density variations surrounding zinc impurity atoms25 and at the Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x crystal supermodulation26. Then, by using Fourier analysis of scanned Josephson tunnelling images, we discover the direct signature of a Cooper-pair density modulation at wavevectors QP ≈ (0.25, 0)2π/a0 and (0, 0.25)2π/a0 in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. The amplitude of these modulations is about five per cent of the background condensate density and their form factor exhibits primarily s or s′ symmetry. This phenomenology is consistent with Ginzburg–Landau theory5,13,14 when a charge density wave5,27 with d-symmetry form factor28,29,30 and wavevector QC = QP coexists with a d-symmetry superconductor; it is also predicted by several contemporary microscopic theories for the pseudogap phase18,19,20,21."
https://openalex.org/W2340896227,"Circadian rhythms in the intracellular concentration of magnesium ions act as a cell-autonomous timekeeping component to determine key clock properties and tune cellular metabolism both in a human cell line and in a unicellular alga. The circadian clock has long been understood to involve cyclic gene expression patterns that coordinate an organism's physiology and behaviour. More recently, biochemical oscillators have been identified and found to also display cyclic changes that also influence physiology. Here Gerben van Ooijen and colleagues present a circadian rhythm in intracellular Mg2+ ion concentrations that seems to be present in human cells and in unicellular algae. Given the importance of Mg2+ as a cofactor for ATP, this ion fluctuation may regulate cellular energy expenditure over the daily cycle. Circadian clocks are fundamental to the biology of most eukaryotes, coordinating behaviour and physiology to resonate with the environmental cycle of day and night through complex networks of clock-controlled genes1,2,3. A fundamental knowledge gap exists, however, between circadian gene expression cycles and the biochemical mechanisms that ultimately facilitate circadian regulation of cell biology4,5. Here we report circadian rhythms in the intracellular concentration of magnesium ions, [Mg2+]i, which act as a cell-autonomous timekeeping component to determine key clock properties both in a human cell line and in a unicellular alga that diverged from each other more than 1 billion years ago6. Given the essential role of Mg2+ as a cofactor for ATP, a functional consequence of [Mg2+]i oscillations is dynamic regulation of cellular energy expenditure over the daily cycle. Mechanistically, we find that these rhythms provide bilateral feedback linking rhythmic metabolism to clock-controlled gene expression. The global regulation of nucleotide triphosphate turnover by intracellular Mg2+ availability has potential to impact upon many of the cell’s more than 600 MgATP-dependent enzymes7 and every cellular system where MgNTP hydrolysis becomes rate limiting. Indeed, we find that circadian control of translation by mTOR8 is regulated through [Mg2+]i oscillations. It will now be important to identify which additional biological processes are subject to this form of regulation in tissues of multicellular organisms such as plants and humans, in the context of health and disease."

https://openalex.org/W2340572980,"USP14 is a major regulator of the proteasome and one of three proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzymes. Its effects on protein turnover are substrate-specific, for unknown reasons. We report that USP14 shows a marked preference for ubiquitin-cyclin B conjugates that carry more than one ubiquitin modification or chain. This specificity is conserved from yeast to humans and is independent of chain linkage type. USP14 has been thought to cleave single ubiquitin groups from the distal tip of a chain, but we find that it removes chains from cyclin B en bloc, proceeding until a single chain remains. The suppression of degradation by USP14's catalytic activity reflects its capacity to act on a millisecond time scale, before the proteasome can initiate degradation of the substrate. In addition, single-molecule studies showed that the dwell time of ubiquitin conjugates at the proteasome was reduced by USP14-dependent deubiquitination. In summary, the specificity of the proteasome can be regulated by rapid ubiquitin chain removal, which resolves substrates based on a novel aspect of ubiquitin conjugate architecture."

https://openalex.org/W2338715669,"Soil salinity is a major constraint to rice production in large inland and coastal areas around the world. Modern high yielding rice varieties are particularly sensitive to high salt stress. There are salt tolerant landraces and traditional varieties of rice but with limited information on genomic regions (QTLs) and genes responsible for their tolerance. Here we describe a method for rapid identification of QTLs for reproductive stage salt tolerance in rice using bulked segregant analysis (BSA) of bi-parental recombinant inbred lines (RIL). The number of RILs required for the creation of two bulks with extreme phenotypes was optimized to be thirty each. The parents and bulks were genotyped using a 50K SNP chip to identify genomic regions showing homogeneity for contrasting alleles of polymorphic SNPs in the two bulks. The method was applied to 'CSR11/MI48' RILs segregating for reproductive stage salt tolerance. Genotyping of the parents and RIL bulks, made on the basis of salt sensitivity index for grain yield, revealed 6,068 polymorphic SNPs and 21 QTL regions showing homogeneity of contrasting alleles in the two bulks. The method was validated further with 'CSR27/MI48' RILs used earlier for mapping salt tolerance QTLs using low-density SSR markers. BSA with 50K SNP chip revealed 5,021 polymorphic loci and 34 QTL regions. This not only confirmed the location of previously mapped QTLs but also identified several new QTLs, and provided a rapid way to scan the whole genome for mapping QTLs for complex agronomic traits in rice."

https://openalex.org/W2338674836,"Feedbacks between climate, erosion and tectonics influence the rates of chemical weathering reactions, which can consume atmospheric CO2 and modulate global climate. However, quantitative predictions for the coupling of these feedbacks are limited because the specific mechanisms by which climate controls erosion are poorly understood. Here we show that climate-dependent chemical weathering controls the erodibility of bedrock-floored rivers across a rainfall gradient on the Big Island of Hawai'i. Field data demonstrate that the physical strength of bedrock in streambeds varies with the degree of chemical weathering, which increases systematically with local rainfall rate. We find that incorporating the quantified relationships between local rainfall and erodibility into a commonly used river incision model is necessary to predict the rates and patterns of downcutting of these rivers. In contrast to using only precipitation-dependent river discharge to explain the climatic control of bedrock river incision, the mechanism of chemical weathering can explain strong coupling between local climate and river incision."
https://openalex.org/W2337604738,"Empathy—putting oneself in another’s shoes—has been described as the “social glue” that holds society together. This study investigates how exposure to sexist video games can decrease empathy for female violence victims. We hypothesized that playing violent-sexist video games would increase endorsement of masculine beliefs, especially among participants who highly identify with dominant and aggressive male game characters. We also hypothesized that the endorsement of masculine beliefs would reduce empathy toward female violence victims. Participants (N = 154) were randomly assigned to play a violent-sexist game, a violent-only game, or a non-violent game. After gameplay, measures of identification with the game character, traditional masculine beliefs, and empathy for female violence victims were assessed. We found that participants’ gender and their identification with the violent male video game character moderated the effects of the exposure to sexist-violent video games on masculine beliefs. Our results supported the prediction that playing violent-sexist video games increases masculine beliefs, which occurred for male (but not female) participants who were highly identified with the game character. Masculine beliefs, in turn, negatively predicted empathic feelings for female violence victims. Overall, our study shows who is most affected by the exposure to sexist-violent video games, and why the effects occur. (200 words)"
https://openalex.org/W2340984831,"Benthic dinoflagellates in the genus Gambierdiscus produce the ciguatoxin precursors responsible for the occurrence of ciguatera toxicity. The prevalence of ciguatera toxins in fish has been linked to the presence and distribution of toxin-producing species in coral reef ecosystems, which is largely determined by the presence of suitable benthic habitat and environmental conditions favorable for growth. Here using single factor experiments, we examined the effects of salinity, irradiance, and temperature on growth of 17 strains of Gambierdiscus representing eight species/phylotypes (G. belizeanus, G. caribaeus, G. carolinianus, G. carpenteri, G. pacificus, G. silvae, Gambierdiscus sp. type 4–5), most of which were established from either Marakei Island, Republic of Kiribati, or St. Thomas, United States Virgin Island (USVI). Comparable to prior studies, growth rates fell within the range of 0–0.48 divisions day-1. In the salinity and temperature studies, Gambierdiscus responded in a near Gaussian, non-linear manner typical for such studies, with optimal and suboptimal growth occurring in the range of salinities of 25 and 45 and 21.0 and 32.5°C. In the irradiance experiment, no mortality was observed; however, growth rates at 55μmol photons · m-2 · s-1 were lower than those at 110–400μmol photons · m-2 · s-1. At the extremes of the environmental conditions tested, growth rates were highly variable, evidenced by large coefficients of variability. However, significant differences in intraspecific growth rates were typically found only at optimal or near-optimal growth conditions. Polynomial regression analyses showed that maximum growth occurred at salinity and temperature levels of 30.1–38.5 and 23.8–29.2°C, respectively. Gambierdiscus growth patterns varied among species, and within individual species: G. belizeanus, G. caribaeus, G. carpenteri, and G. pacificus generally exhibited a wider range of tolerance to environmental conditions, which may explain their broad geographic distribution. In contrast, G. silvae and Gambierdiscus sp. types 4–5 all displayed a comparatively narrow range of tolerance to temperature, salinity, and irradiance."
https://openalex.org/W2340261903,"Antagonism of pro-inflammatory transcription factors by monomeric glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has long been viewed as central to glucocorticoid (GC) efficacy. However, the mechanisms and targets through which GCs exert therapeutic effects in diseases such as asthma remain incompletely understood. We previously defined a surprising cooperative interaction between GR and NF-κB that enhanced expression of A20 (TNFAIP3), a potent inhibitor of NF-κB. Here we extend this observation to establish that A20 is required for maximal cytokine repression by GCs. To ascertain the global extent of GR and NF-κB cooperation, we determined genome-wide occupancy of GR, the p65 subunit of NF-κB, and RNA polymerase II in airway epithelial cells treated with dexamethasone, TNF, or both using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing. We found that GR recruits p65 to dimeric GR binding sites across the genome and discovered additional regulatory elements in which GR-p65 cooperation augments gene expression. GR targets regulated by this mechanism include key anti-inflammatory and injury response genes such as SERPINA1, which encodes α1 antitrypsin, and FOXP4, an inhibitor of mucus production. Although dexamethasone treatment reduced RNA polymerase II occupancy of TNF targets such as IL8 and TNFAIP2, we were unable to correlate specific binding sequences for GR or occupancy patterns with repressive effects on transcription. Our results suggest that cooperative anti-inflammatory gene regulation by GR and p65 contributes to GC efficacy, whereas tethering interactions between GR and p65 are not universally required for GC-based gene repression.

Direct association of GR with DNA through canonical GR binding sites is implicated in transcriptional induction by GCs, whereas interactions between GR and inflammatory transcription factor complexes such as NF-κB, in a process that may not require direct association of GR with DNA, has been suggested to result in transcriptional repression (6McMaster A.

It is well established that GCs act via GR in cultured airway epithelial cells to repress inflammatory responses to a range of clinically relevant inflammatory stimuli, including IL1B, TNF, and rhinoviral infection (31Edwards M.R.

Allergy. 2013; 3: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic basis for GR-mediated repression of gene expression in airway epithelial cells remains incompletely understood, and the relative role of transrepression versus induction of anti-inflammatory genes by GCs in repressing airway inflammation has yet to be established. To further understand the mechanisms of GR signaling in the airway epithelium, we previously studied the effects of dexamethasone (dex, a potent synthetic GC) on the expression of several pro- and anti-inflammatory targets of TNF signaling in Beas-2B cells (36Altonsy M.O. Sasse S.K. Phang T.L. Gerber A.N. Context-dependent cooperation between nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and the glucocorticoid receptor at a TNFAIP3 intronic enhancer: a mechanism to maintain negative feedback control of inflammation.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 8231-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which are an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line. We showed that, in comparison to robust repression of cytokine mRNA levels, GCs spare or augment the expression of negative feedback regulators of NF-κB, such as TNFAIP3 (frequently referred to as A20). Furthermore, we identified inductive synergy between GR and NF-κB at a novel enhancer within the TNFAIP3 locus and proposed a model in which cooperation between GR and NF-κB at anti-inflammatory loci is central to the therapeutic effects of GCs. Subsequent studies by other researchers have supported this notion, with co-induction of IRAK3 (frequently referred to as IRAKM) and Sphk1 by GR and inflammatory stimuli linked to anti-inflammatory effects of GCs in various models of lung disease (37Miyata M. Lee J.Y. Susuki-Miyata S. Wang W.Y. Xu H. Kai H. Kobayashi K.S. Flavell R.A. Li J.D. Glucocorticoids suppress inflammation via the up-regulation of negative regulator IRAK-M.Nat.

Commun. 2015; 67796Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, cooperative gene induction mediated by convergence of activated GR and inflammatory signals at specific enhancers appears to contribute to the anti-inflammatory properties of GCs. However, the overall pattern of cross-talk between GR and NF-κB in airway epithelial cells and whether GR and NF-κB cooperate at additional loci to repress inflammation has yet to be established. In this study we extended our prior work on GR cross-talk with NF-κB to determine whether GCs selectively spare or augment the expression of anti-inflammatory targets of TNF in primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells and whether TNFAIP3 suppresses TLR3-mediated cytokine induction. We applied siRNA knockdown of TNFAIP3 to determine whether this GR-p65 co-regulated target is required for maximal repression of cytokine expression by GCs. Furthermore, we expanded our studies of interactions between GR and NF-κB to encompass integrated ChIP-seq studies of GR, the p65 subunit of NF-κB, and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy in Beas-2B cells. Our results provide a framework for understanding the molecular basis of GC action in the airway epithelium.

The pFSTL3, pTNFAIP3, and pABR plasmids were generated in the pGL3-Promoter vector. PCR primers were designed to amplify putative GR-p65 cooperative binding regions of FSTL3, TNFAIP3, and ABR identified through the ChIP-Seq data. Amplified PCR product from FSTL3 and TNFAIP3 was introduced into pCR 2.1 TOPO (Life Technologies) and subsequently cloned into the pGL3-Promoter vector using KpnI/BglII. PCR product from ABR was directly cloned into the pGL3-Promoter using NheI/BglII. The cloning primers are provided in supplemental Table S1. Transfections were performed, and luciferase activity was assayed as previously described (42Sasse S.K. Mailloux C.M. Barczak A.J. Wang Q. Altonsy M.O. Jain M.K. Haldar S.M. Gerber A.N.

At ∼80% confluence, cells were infected with Ad-TNFAIP3 or Ad-GFP (control) adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 50 for 17 h and then allowed to recover in fresh medium for 30 h. Cells were then treated with poly(I:C) (2.5 μg/ml) or infected with HRV-1A (TCID50 = 107) for 24 h. After treatment, the cells were harvested with TRIzol for RNA, and changes in gene expression were assayed by qRT-PCR as described previously (42Sasse S.K. Mailloux C.M. Barczak A.J. Wang Q.

Beas-2B cells were seeded in 6-well dishes and transfected with si-TNFAIP3 or si-Ctrl using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Approximately 48 h after transfection cells were treated with vehicle, dex, TNF, or TNF + dex for 4 or 24 h and harvested for RNA and protein. IL8 protein levels in the supernatants from cells treated for 24 h was assayed by ELISA (R&D Systems). For GR knockdown experiments, cells were seeded in 6-well dishes or 10-cm dishes and transfected with si-GR or si-Ctrl. After 48 h, cells in 6-well dishes were treated with vehicle or dex for 4 h and harvested for RNA and protein. Cells in 10-cm dishes were treated for 1 h, and chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed. Knockdown was confirmed using Western blotting. Beas-2B cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Thermo Scientific). Approximately 30–50 μg of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Immun-blot; Bio-Rad). Membranes were immunoblotted with antibodies against proteins of interest, and bands were visualized using ECL Prime detection system from GE Healthcare. Primary Airway epithelial cells at passage 2 were plated on 12-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well and grown to 80% confluence. Beas-2B cells were plated on 6-well plates at 3.5 × 105 cells/well and grown to 90% confluence. Cells were then treated with vehicle, TNF, dex, or TNF + dex for 4 h and then lysed in TRIzol (Life Technologies). RNA was purified using the PureLink RNA Mini kit from Life Technologies. Reverse transcription of RNA, qRT-PCR, and gene expression analyses were performed as previously described (42Sasse S.K. Mailloux C.M. Barczak A.J. Wang Q. Altonsy M.O. Jain M.K. Haldar S.M.

Percent repression, where indicated, was calculated as ([cycle number change (relative to vehicle) for TNF treatment] − [cycle number change (relative to vehicle) for TNF + dex treatment]) ÷ [relative cycle number change for TNF treatment]. Percent repression for IL8 protein levels was determined similarly. Beas-2B cells at 100% confluence were treated with vehicle, dex, TNF, or TNF + dex in fresh medium for 1 h. ChIP and qPCR analysis of purified ChIP DNA was performed as previously described except that the chromatin was fragmented at high power for 34 cycles (1 cycle = 30 s on, 30 s off) in a Diagenode Bioruptor. Enrichment of the protein of interest at a putative target region was calculated on a log2 scale and was determined by comparing the Ct values of the specific target region with the geometric mean of the Ct values of three negative control regions. For the siRNA knockdown ChIP experiments, enrichment was normalized relative to input, as the Ct values for the internal negative control regions were too high to be reliable. All ChIP-qPCR experiments were performed in biological quadruplicate and repeated two or more times. Primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. ChIP-seq and analysis was performed essentially as described (43Sasse S.K. Zuo Z. Kadiyala V. Zhang L. Pufall M.A. Jain M.K. Phang T.L. Stormo G.D. Gerber A.N.

Briefly, a minimum of 1 ng of DNA from ChIP samples was used to prepare libraries (Nugen Ovation Ultralow System V2 1-16 Part no. 0344). Samples were run on an Illumina HiSeq using 1 × 50-bp end reads. FASTQ sequence file quality was assessed (Babraham Bioinformatics).

Using the HOMER group, peaks were converted to the BigWig format and uploaded into the UCSC Genome Browser using the custom track feature. Custom tracks annotated on the UCSC Genome Browser Feb. 200 (GRCh37/hg19) Assembly are freely available upon request. Using an R implementation, the consistency of replicated sample peaks was assessed with the Irreproducible Discovery Rate algorithm (46Li Q. Brown J.B. Huang H. Bickel P.J.

https://openalex.org/W2336495737,"Acinetobacter baumannii is a non-fermenting, gram-negative bacterium. In recent years, the frequency of A. baumannii infections has continued to increase, and multidrug-resistant strains are emerging in hospitalized patients. Therefore, as therapeutic options become limited, the potential of phages as natural antimicrobial agents to control infections is worth reconsidering. In our previous study, we isolated ten virulent double-stranded DNA A. baumannii phages, ϕAB1–9 and ϕAB11, and found that each has a narrow host range. Many reports indicate that receptor-binding protein of phage mediates host recognition; however, understanding of the specific interactions between A. baumannii and phages remains very limited. In this study, host determinants of A. baumannii phages were investigated. Sequence comparison of ϕAB6 and ϕAB1 revealed high degrees of conservation among their genes except the tail fiber protein (ORF41 in ϕAB1 and ORF40 in ϕAB6). Furthermore, we found that ORF40ϕAB6 has polysaccharide depolymerase activity capable of hydrolyzing the A. baumannii exopolysaccharide and is a component of the phage tail apparatus determining host specificity. Thus, the lytic phages and their associated depolymerase not only have potential as alternative therapeutic agents for treating A. baumannii infections but also provide useful and highly specific tools for studying host strain exopolysaccharides and producing glycoconjugate vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2335795543,"The eyes of the Tully monster (Tullimonstrum) possess ultrastructural details indicating homology with vertebrate eyes. Since its discovery in 1958 by Francis Tully in the approximately 300-million-year-old Mazon Creek fossil beds in Illinois, the zoological affinities of the soft-bodied animal popularly known as the Tully monster (Tullimonstrum gregarium) have remained mysterious. It is a remarkable looking creature, with a fish-like body featuring prominent eyes at each end of a horizontal bar, and jaws on the end of a long, jointed proboscis. Its origins have been compared variously with nemertean and polychaete worms, molluscs, conodonts and even stem-group arthropods. Now two papers in this issue identify Tullimonstrum securely as a vertebrate. Thomas Clements et al. studied the eyes and found ultrastructural details indicating homology with those of vertebrates. Victoria McCoy et al. examined more than 1,200 specimens. They re-interpret many known features, and describe and interpret many new ones: all are consistent with Tullimonstrum being a vertebrate, akin to lampreys and increasing the morphological disparity of that group. Tullimonstrum gregarium is an iconic soft-bodied fossil from the Carboniferous Mazon Creek Lagerstätte (Illinois, USA)1. Despite a large number of specimens and distinct anatomy, various analyses over the past five decades have failed to determine the phylogenetic affinities of the ‘Tully monster’, and although it has been allied to such disparate phyla as the Mollusca2, Annelida3,4 or Chordata5, it remains enigmatic1,2,3,4,5. The nature and phylogenetic affinities of Tullimonstrum have defied confident systematic placement because none of its preserved anatomy provides unequivocal evidence of homology, without which comparative analysis fails. Here we show that the eyes of Tullimonstrum possess ultrastructural details indicating homology with vertebrate eyes. Anatomical analysis using scanning electron microscopy reveals that the eyes of Tullimonstrum preserve a retina defined by a thick sheet comprising distinct layers of spheroidal and cylindrical melanosomes. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and multivariate statistics provide further evidence that these microbodies are melanosomes. A range of animals have melanin in their eyes, but the possession of melanosomes of two distinct morphologies arranged in layers, forming retinal pigment epithelium, is a synapomorphy of vertebrates. Our analysis indicates that in addition to evidence of colour patterning6, ecology7 and thermoregulation8, fossil melanosomes can also carry a phylogenetic signal. Identification in Tullimonstrum of spheroidal and cylindrical melanosomes forming the remains of retinal pigment epithelium indicates that it is a vertebrate; considering its body parts in this new light suggests it was an anatomically unusual member of total group Vertebrata."
https://openalex.org/W2342039892,"The plasticity of AML drives poor clinical outcomes and confounds its longitudinal detection. However, the immediate impact of treatment on the leukemic and non-leukemic cells of the bone marrow and blood remains relatively understudied. Here, we conducted a pilot study of high dimensional longitudinal monitoring of immunophenotype in AML. To characterize changes in cell phenotype before, during, and immediately after induction treatment, we developed a 27-antibody panel for mass cytometry focused on surface diagnostic markers and applied it to 46 samples of blood or bone marrow tissue collected over time from 5 AML patients. Central goals were to determine whether changes in AML phenotype would be captured effectively by cytomic tools and to implement methods for describing the evolving phenotypes of AML cell subsets. Mass cytometry data were analyzed using established computational techniques. Within this pilot study, longitudinal immune monitoring with mass cytometry revealed fundamental changes in leukemia phenotypes that occurred over time during and after induction in the refractory disease setting. Persisting AML blasts became more phenotypically distinct from stem and progenitor cells due to expression of novel marker patterns that differed from pre-treatment AML cells and from all cell types observed in healthy bone marrow. This pilot study of single cell immune monitoring in AML represents a powerful tool for precision characterization and targeting of resistant disease."
https://openalex.org/W2337795314,"The United States has experienced an unsustainable increase of the biomedical research workforce over the past 3 decades. This expansion has led to a myriad of consequences, including an imbalance in the number of researchers and available tenure-track faculty positions, extended postdoctoral training periods, increasing age of investigators at first U.S. National Institutes of Health R01 grant, and exodus of talented individuals seeking careers beyond traditional academe. Without accurate data on the biomedical research labor market, challenges will remain in resolving these problems and in advising trainees of viable career options and the skills necessary to be productive in their careers. We analyzed workforce trends, integrating both traditional labor market information and real-time job data. We generated a profile of the current biomedical research workforce, performed labor gap analyses of occupations in the workforce at regional and national levels, and assessed skill transferability between core and complementary occupations. We conclude that although supply into the workforce and the number of job postings for occupations within that workforce have grown over the past decade, supply continues to outstrip demand. Moreover, we identify practical skill sets from real-time job postings to optimally equip trainees for an array of careers to effectively meet future workforce demand.-Mason, J.

Studies evaluating Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP) models including dominance effects have not been performed in the univariate and multivariate context in the data analysis of this crop. A single cross hybrid construction procedure was performed in this study using phenotypic data and actual molecular markers of 4,091 maize lines from the public database Panzea. A total of 400 simple hybrids resulting from this process were analyzed using the univariate and multivariate GBLUP model considering only additive effects additive plus dominance effects. Historic heritability scenarios of five traits and other genetic architecture settings were used to compare models, evaluating the predictive ability and estimation of variance components. Marginal differences were detected between the multivariate and univariate models. The main explanation for the small discrepancy between models is the low- to moderate-magnitude correlations between the traits studied and moderate heritabilities. These conditions do not favor the advantages of multivariate analysis. The inclusion of dominance effects in the models was an efficient strategy to improve the predictive ability and estimation quality of variance components."
https://openalex.org/W2341081287,"Domestication of tomato has resulted in large diversity in fruit phenotypes. An intensive phenotyping of 127 tomato accessions from 20 countries revealed extensive morphological diversity in fruit traits. The diversity in fruit traits clustered the accessions into nine classes and identified certain promising lines having desirable traits pertaining to total soluble salts (TSS), carotenoids, ripening index, weight and shape. Factor analysis of the morphometric data from Tomato Analyzer showed that the fruit shape is a complex trait shared by several factors. The 100% variance between round and flat fruit shapes was explained by one discriminant function having a canonical correlation of 0.874 by stepwise discriminant analysis. A set of 10 genes (ACS2, COP1, CYC-B, RIN, MSH2, NAC-NOR, PHOT1, PHYA, PHYB and PSY1) involved in various plant developmental processes were screened for SNP polymorphism by EcoTILLING. The genetic diversity in these genes revealed a total of 36 non-synonymous and 18 synonymous changes leading to the identification of 28 haplotypes. The average frequency of polymorphism across the genes was 0.038/Kb. Significant negative Tajima'D statistic in two of the genes, ACS2 and PHOT1 indicated the presence of rare alleles in low frequency. Our study indicates that while there is low polymorphic diversity in the genes regulating plant development, the population shows wider phenotype diversity. Nonetheless, morphological and genetic diversity of the present collection can be further exploited as potential resources in future."
https://openalex.org/W2338752975,"The IL-2/JAK3/STAT-5 signaling pathway is involved on the initiation and maintenance of the transcription factor Foxp3 in regulatory T cells (Treg) and has been associated with demethylation of the intronic Conserved Non Coding Sequence-2 (CNS2). However, the role of the JAK/STAT pathway in controlling Foxp3 in the short term has been poorly investigated. Using two different JAK/STAT pharmacological inhibitors, we observed a detectable loss of Foxp3 after 10 min. of treatment that affected 70% of the cells after one hour. Using cycloheximide, a general inhibitor of mRNA translation, we determined that Foxp3, but not CD25, has a high turnover in IL-2 stimulated Treg. This reduction was correlated with a rapid reduction of Foxp3 mRNA. This loss of Foxp3 was associated with a loss in STAT-5 binding to the CNS2, which however remains demethylated. Consequently, Foxp3 expression returns to normal level upon restoration of basal JAK/STAT signaling in vivo. Reduced expression of several genes defining Treg identity was also observed upon treatment. Thus, our results demonstrate that Foxp3 has a rapid turn over in Treg partly controlled at the transcriptional level by the JAK/STAT pathway."

Rats were randomized to treatment (n = 6/group): control, rt-PA, or rt-PA+3-MHz ultrasound insonation with BR38 or SonoVue® at full or 1/3 dose. Treatment duration was 60 minutes, beginning after withdrawal of the filament, and sacrifice was immediately after treatment. Vascular volumes were evaluated with microcomputed tomography. Results Total vascular volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere was reduced in control and rt-PA groups (p<0.05), but was not significantly different from the contralateral hemisphere in all microbubble-treated groups (p>0.1). Conclusions Microbubble-enhanced sonothrombolysis improves microvascular patency. This effect is not dose- or microbubble formulation-dependent suggesting a class effect of microbubbles promoting microvascular reopening. This study demonstrates that microbubble-enhanced sonothrombolysis may be a therapeutic strategy for patients with persistent hypoperfusion of the ischemic territory."
https://openalex.org/W2336887914,"The goal of this study was to identify Cd-resistant bacterial strains with endurance capacity and to evaluate their ability to remove cadmium ions from cadmium-polluted water. The Bacillus cereusS5 strain identified in this study had the closest genetic relationship with B. cereus sp. Cp1 and performed well in the removal of Cd2+ions from solution. The results showed that both the live and dead biomasses of the Cd2+-tolerant B. cereus S5 strain could absorb Cd2+ ions in solution but that the live biomass of the B. cereus S5 strain outperformed the dead biomass at lower Cd2+concentrations. An analysis of the cadmium tolerance genes of B. cereus S5 identified ATPase genes that were associated with cadmium tolerance and involved in the ATP pumping mechanism. The FTIR spectra revealed the presence of amino, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the pristine biomass and indicated that the cadmium ion removal ability was related to the structure of the strain. The maximum absorption capacity of the B. cereus S5 strain in viable spore biomass was 70.16 mg/g (dry weight) based on a pseudo-second-order kinetic model fit to the experimental data. The Langmuir and Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm adsorption models fit the cadmium ion adsorption data well, and the kinetic curves indicated that the adsorption rate was second-order. For Cd2+ concentrations (mg/L) of 1-109 mg/L, good removal efficiency (>80%) was achieved using approximately 3.48-10.3 g/L of active spore biomass of the B. cereus S5 strain. A cadmium-tolerant bacteria-activated carbon-immobilized column could be used for a longer duration and exhibited greater treatment efficacy than the control column in the treatment of cadmium-polluted water. In addition, a toxicity assessment using mice demonstrated that the biomass of the B. cereus S5 strain and its fermentation products were non-toxic. Thus, the isolated B. cereus S5 strain can be considered an alternative biological adsorbent for use in emergency responses to severe cadmium pollution and in the routine treatment of trace cadmium pollution."
https://openalex.org/W2338177257,"Objectives To delineate clinical and pathological features and determine the prognostic factors of primary intraosseous squamous cell carcinoma (PIOSCC). Materials and methods Patients diagnosed with PIOSCC, attending the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery, Nanjing stomatological hospital between 2005 and 2015, were identified and retrospectively reviewed for clinical and pathological characteristics. Therapeutic modalities were measured and related follow-up data recorded, in order to determine prognostic factors of PIOSSC. Results A total of 77 patients with PIOSCC were included in the study. Mean age at diagnosis was 58.8 years, (range, 37−81 years). Of the 77 patients, there were 58 men and 19 women. The most common location of disease was the mandible (71.42%), particularly the posterior mandible. The common presenting symptoms included jaw swelling (79.2%) and ulceration (42.65%). The estimated 2-year and 5-year overall survival were 68.9% and 38.8%, respectively. Univariate analysis identified the following as negative prognostic factors: histological grade, N classification, nodal status and treatment modalities. However, multivariate analysis determined positive nodal status, high histological grade and advanced N classification as the independent significant prognostic factors. Conclusion Our results demonstrate several clinical and pathological features of PIOSCC and identify important prognostic factors associated with overall survival in PIOSCC. These prognostic factors include nodal status, histological grade, N classification, and treatment modalities, all of which are important for patient counseling and may be useful for the development of new treatment approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2335889474,"During human heart failure, the balance of cardiac energy use switches from predominantly fatty acids (FAs) to glucose. We hypothesized that this substrate shift was the result of mitochondrial degeneration; therefore, we examined mitochondrial oxidation and ultrastructure in the failing human heart by using respirometry, transmission electron microscopy, and gene expression studies of demographically matched donor and failing human heart left ventricular (LV) tissues. Surprisingly, respiratory capacities for failing LV isolated mitochondria (n = 9) were not significantly diminished compared with donor LV isolated mitochondria (n = 7) for glycolysis (pyruvate + malate)- or FA (palmitoylcarnitine)-derived substrates, and mitochondrial densities, assessed via citrate synthase activity, were consistent between groups. Transmission electron microscopy images also showed no ultrastructural remodeling for failing vs. donor mitochondria; however, the fraction of lipid droplets (LDs) in direct contact with a mitochondrion was reduced, and the average distance between an LD and its nearest neighboring mitochondrion was increased. Analysis of FA processing gene expression between donor and failing LVs revealed 0.64-fold reduced transcript levels for the mitochondrial-LD tether, perilipin 5, in the failing myocardium (P = 0.003). Thus, reduced FA use in heart failure may result from improper delivery, potentially via decreased perilipin 5 expression and mitochondrial-LD tethering, and not from intrinsic mitochondrial dysfunction.—Holzem, K.

Nrd1 and Nab3 are sequence-specific RNA binding proteins, and Sen1 helicase (senataxin in humans) has an ATPase activity that directly dissociates RNApII from the templates (5Porrua O. Libri D. A bacterial-like mechanism for transcription termination by the Sen1p helicase in budding yeast.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Nrd1 also recognizes the serine 5-phosphorylated (Ser(P)-5) CTD of RNApII using its CID (6Vasiljeva L. Kim M. Mutschler H. Buratowski S. Meinhart A.

Because the Ser(P)-5 CTD is prevalent in the early stage of transcription, the Nrd1 CID-RNApII CTD interaction has been suggested to dictate a regional specificity of Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1-dependent transcription termination (7Buratowski S.

Indeed, Nrd1 having the CID of Rtt103 that recognizes the Serine 2-phosphorylated CTD becomes capable of triggering RNApII termination at regions where Nrd1-Nab3 binding sites and serine 2-phosphorylated CTD are co-localized, satisfyingly confirming this model (8Heo D.H.

The nuclear exosome consists of the core exosome and a nuclear-specific subunit Rrp6 (PM/Scl100 in humans) that functions in RNA 3′-end processing using 3′-5′ exoribonuclease activity (10Butler J.S.

The many pathways of RNA degradation.Cell. 2009; 136: 763-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The core exosome is a catalytically inactive barrel-shaped complex composed of nine subunits (Exo-9: RNase pleckstrin homology-like proteins (Rrp41/42/43/45/46 and Mtr3) and S1/KH domain proteins (Rrp4/40 and Csl4)) as well as Dis3 (also known as Rrp44), which is a 3′-5′ exo/endonuclease. Located at the bottom of Exo-9, Dis3 trims or degrades the RNA substrates passed through the central pore of Exo-9 (14Schneider C. Tollervey D. Threading the barrel of the RNA exosome.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 485-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast, Rrp6 sits on top of the Exo-9 S1/KH ring above the central channel, and the RNAs traverse the S1/KH ring and enter into the active site of Rrp6 for degradation (15Wasmuth E.V.

The TRAMP (Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4 polyadenylation) complex is a well characterized cofactor of the nuclear exosome. It contains a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase, Trf4/5, a putative RNA-binding protein containing zinc knuckle motifs, Air1/2, and the DEXH-box RNA helicase, Mtr4. Upon stimulation by the TRAMP complex, the nuclear exosome trims or degrades RNAs (17Vanácová S. Wolf J. Martin G. Blank D. Dettwiler S. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keith G. Keller W.

Recently, Trf4 was shown to interact with the Nrd1 CID, suggesting that degradation of Nrd1-terminated transcripts by the exosome is coordinated at least in part via Trf4 (19Tudek A. Porrua O.

Rrp47 directly interacts with the PMC2NT domain of Rrp6 (22Stead J.A. Costello J.L. Livingstone M.J. Mitchell P.

The exosome-binding factors Rrp6 and Rrp47 form a composite surface for recruiting the Mtr4 helicase.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 2829-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rrp47 and TRAMP may be functionally linked to the activity of Rrp6. Mpp6 is a nuclear exosome-associated RNA-binding protein involved in 5.8S rRNA maturation in humans (24Schilders G. Raijmakers R. Raats J.M. Pruijn G.J. MPP6 is an exosome-associated RNA-binding protein involved in 5.8S rRNA maturation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6795-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and roles in RNA surveillance and degradation of non-coding RNAs have been reported in yeast (21Milligan L. Decourty L. Saveanu C. Rappsilber J. Ceulemans H. Jacquier A. Tollervey D. A yeast exosome cofactor, Mpp6, functions in RNA surveillance and in the degradation of noncoding RNA transcripts.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5446-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). But the precise role of Mpp6 in exosome function has been unclear. Despite overlapping enzymatic activities, Rrp6 and Dis3 do not seem to be redundant in processing many RNA substrates. For example, Dis3 initially degrades 3′-ends of precursor 5.8S rRNAs and many sn/snoRNAs to make intermediates that are then trimmed to final mature length by Rrp6 (25Allmang C. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Degradation of ribosomal RNA precursors by the exosome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1684-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 26van Hoof A. Lennertz P. Parker R. Yeast exosome mutants accumulate 3′-extended polyadenylated forms of U4 small nuclear RNA and small nucleolar RNAs.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). When analyzed genome-wide, a remarkable specificity of Dis3 toward intron-containing pre-mRNA transcripts and tRNA precursors was observed, whereas Dis3 and Rrp6 play largely overlapping roles in degrading cryptic unstable transcripts and stable unannotated transcripts (27Gudipati R.K. Xu Z. Lebreton A. Séraphin B. Steinmetz L.M. Jacquier A. Libri D. Extensive degradation of RNA precursors by the exosome in wild-type cells.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 409-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Also, Rrp6 carries out some of its critical functions independently of the core exosome (28Callahan K.P. Butler J.S. Evidence for core exosome independent function of the nuclear exoribonuclease Rrp6p.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6645-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). When tested in vitro, selection of RNA degradation by Rrp6 or Dis3 is stochastic (15Wasmuth E.V. Januszyk K. Lima C.D. Structure of an Rrp6-RNA exosome complex bound to poly(A) RNA.Nature. 2014; 511: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), indicating that there might be a mechanism in vivo for choosing a particular RNA degradation route within the exosome. But what regulates the choice and how RNA substrates are specifically directed to one or the other exonuclease remain largely unknown. In this study we investigated Nrd1 interactions with the exosome using the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay and found that two nuclear exosome cofactors Mpp6 and Trf4 directly and mutually exclusively interact with the Nrd1 CID, thus connecting Nrd1 to RNA processing by the exosome. Intriguingly, Mpp6 promotes the association of Nrd1 with Dis3 via RNA, whereas Trf4 enhances the Nrd1-Rrp6 interaction. Furthermore, deletion of MPP6 showed a cumulative RNA processing defect when combined with Rrp6 depletion, whereas deletion of TRF4 did so with Dis3 depletion. Consistently, mutually exclusive interaction of Mpp6 with Nrd1 and Rrp6 makes it unlikely that Mpp6 stimulates degradation of Nrd1-terminated transcripts by Rrp6. These results suggest two processing pathways (Mpp6-Dis3 and Trf4-Rrp6) that determine the RNA degradation route within the exosome for multiple Nrd1-terminated transcripts.

Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genomic libraries and a host strain designed for highly efficient two-hybrid selection in yeast.Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into pGAD and pGBD, respectively. Transformed cells with pGAD and pGBD plasmids were plated on SC−Leu−Trp −His to select clones allowing activation of the HIS3 reporter gene. After growth at 30 °C for 3 days under this low stringency condition, each clone was replica-plated onto SC−Leu−Trp−Ade medium to select transformants that also allow activation of the more stringent ADE2 reporter. For spotting analysis, cells were grown in SC−Leu−Trp medium for ∼16 h and adjusted to A600 ≈ 0.3. A small aliquot (∼5 μl) from each cell suspension was put on SC−Leu−Trp, SC−Leu-Trp-His, or SC−Leu −Trp−Ade plates. Representative spotting images from multiple (at least three) independent experiments were shown. Cells were grown in SC medium to an A600 ≈ 1.6 and broken by glass beads in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors.

The aim of this study is to produce a normative model of serum inhibin B in males from birth to seventeen years. We used a well-defined search strategy to identify studies containing data that can contribute to a larger approximation of the healthy population. We combined data from four published studies (n = 709) and derived an internally validated model with high goodness-of-fit and normally distributed residuals. Our results show that inhibin B increases following birth to a post-natal peak of 270 pg/mL (IQR 210–335 pg/mL) and then decreases during childhood followed by a rise at around 8 years, peaking at a mean 305 pg/mL (IQR 240–445 pg/mL) at around age 17. Following this peak there is a slow decline to the standard mature adult normal range of 170 pg/mL (IQR 125–215 pg/mL). This normative model suggests that 35% of the variation in Inhibin B levels in young males is due to age alone, provides an age-specific reference range for inhibin B in the young healthy male population, and will be a powerful tool in evaluating the potential of inhibin B as a marker of Sertoli cell function in pre-pubertal boys."

https://openalex.org/W2339521697,"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in feedlot cattle, caused by multiple pathogens that become more virulent in response to stress. As clinical signs often go undetected and various preventive strategies failed, identification of genes affecting BRD is essential for selection for resistance. Selective DNA pooling (SDP) was applied in a genome wide association study (GWAS) to map BRD QTLs in Israeli Holstein male calves. Kosher scoring of lung adhesions was used to allocate 122 and 62 animals to High (Glatt Kosher) and Low (Non-Kosher) resistant groups, respectively. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip according to the Infinium protocol. Moving average of -logP was used to map QTLs and Log drop was used to define their boundaries (QTLRs). The combined procedure was efficient for high resolution mapping. Nineteen QTLRs distributed over 13 autosomes were found, some overlapping previous studies. The QTLRs contain polymorphic functional and expression candidate genes to affect kosher status, with putative immunological and wound healing activities. Kosher phenotyping was shown to be a reliable means to map QTLs affecting BRD morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2340622963,"Improved antigenicity against HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein is needed to elicit vaccine-induced protective immunity in humans. Here we describe the first tests in non-human primates (NHPs) of Env gp140 protein fused to a humanized anti-LOX-1 recombinant antibody for delivering Env directly to LOX-1-bearing antigen presenting cells, especially dendritic cells (DC). LOX-1, or 1ectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-1, is expressed on various antigen presenting cells and endothelial cells, and is involved in promoting humoral immune responses. The anti-LOX-1 Env gp140 fusion protein was tested for priming immune responses and boosting responses in animals primed with replication competent NYVAC-KC Env gp140 vaccinia virus. Anti-LOX-1 Env gp140 vaccination elicited robust cellular and humoral responses when used for either priming or boosting immunity. Co-administration with Poly ICLC, a TLR3 agonist, was superior to GLA, a TLR4 agonist. Both CD4+ and CD8+ Env-specific T cell responses were elicited by anti-LOX-1 Env gp140, but in particular the CD4+ T cells were multifunctional and directed to multiple epitopes. Serum IgG and IgA antibody responses induced by anti-LOX-1 Env gp140 against various gp140 domains were cross-reactive across HIV-1 clades; however, the sera neutralized only HIV-1 bearing sequences most similar to the clade C 96ZM651 Env gp140 carried by the anti-LOX-1 vehicle. These data, as well as the safety of this protein vaccine, justify further exploration of this DC-targeting vaccine approach for protective immunity against HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2339065539,"Chondrogenesis and endochondral ossification are precisely controlled by cellular interactions with surrounding matrix proteins and growth factors that mediate cellular signaling pathways. Here, we report that extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) is a previously unrecognized regulator of chondrogenesis. ECM1 is induced in the course of chondrogenesis and its expression in chondrocytes strictly depends on parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) signaling pathway. Overexpression of ECM1 suppresses, whereas suppression of ECM1 enhances, chondrocyte differentiation and hypertrophy in vitro and ex vivo. In addition, target transgene of ECM1 in chondrocytes or osteoblasts in mice leads to striking defects in cartilage development and endochondral bone formation. Of importance, ECM1 seems to be critical for PTHrP action in chondrogenesis, as blockage of ECM1 nearly abolishes PTHrP regulation of chondrocyte hypertrophy, and overexpression of ECM1 rescues disorganized growth plates of PTHrP-null mice. Furthermore, ECM1 and progranulin chondrogenic growth factor constitute an interaction network and act in concert in the regulation of chondrogenesis.—Kong L., Zhao, Y.-P., Tian, Q.-Y., Feng J.-Q., Kobayashi, T., Merregaert, J., Liu, C.-J.

https://openalex.org/W2342098819,"Social hostility is seldom expressed overtly. More often than not, individuals try to get their hostile message across without risking violent altercations. However, subtle and relatively covert hostility is not easy to research. We suggest a novel way with the SoMi paradigm, a social decision making task that offers participants the opportunity to be socially mindful or socially hostile by leaving or limiting choice to others. Sampling a general population we find that, relative to friends and strangers, foes are indeed met with greater social hostility (Study 1). Focusing on the highly competitive environment of youth soccer, we find that rival team members elicit social hostility, whereas teammates elicit social mindfulness (Study 2). We conclude that social mindfulness and social hostility play a subtle role in the dynamics of interpersonal and/or intergroup relationships, in which leaving or limiting choice is one of the subtle ways to express benevolent versus hostile intentions; the SoMi paradigm may thus be helpful in identifying which way the ball rolls."
https://openalex.org/W2336714137,"Filamentation induced by cAMP (Fic) domain proteins have been shown to catalyze the transfer of the AMP moiety from ATP onto a protein target. This type of post-translational modification was recently shown to play a crucial role in pathogenicity mediated by two bacterial virulence factors. Herein we characterize a novel Fic domain protein that we identified from the human pathogen Clostridium difficile. The crystal structure shows that the protein adopts a classical all-helical Fic fold, which belongs to class II of Fic domain proteins characterized by an intrinsic N-terminal autoinhibitory α-helix. A conserved glutamate residue in the inhibitory helix motif was previously shown in other Fic domain proteins to prevent proper binding of the ATP γ-phosphate. However, here we demonstrate that both ATP binding and autoadenylylation activity of the C. difficile Fic domain protein are independent of the inhibitory motif. In support of this, the crystal structure of a mutant of this Fic protein in complex with ATP reveals that the γ-phosphate adopts a conformation unique among Fic domains that seems to override the effect of the inhibitory helix. These results provide important structural insight into the adenylylation reaction mechanism catalyzed by Fic domains. Our findings reveal the presence of a class II Fic domain protein in the human pathogen C. difficile that is not regulated by autoinhibition and challenge the current dogma that all class I-III Fic domain proteins are inhibited by the inhibitory α-helix.

Eyes of keratoconic patients were similar to the PMD patients in age and severity (K2, Kmax and Rmin). Non-stimulated tear samples were collected from nine eyes of seven PMD patients, 55 eyes of 55 KC patients and 24 eyes of 24 healthy controls. The mediators' (interleukin -6, -10, chemokine ligand 5, -8, -10, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -9, -13, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor, nerve growth factor) concentrations were measured using Cytometric Bead Array.MMP-9 was the only mediator which presented relevant variances between the two patient groups (p = 0.005). The ratios of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were 2.45, 0.40 and 0.23 in PMD, KC and the controls, respectively.As far as we are aware, this is the first study that aims to reveal the biochemical differences between PMD and KC. Further studies of biomarkers to investigate the precise role of these mediators need to be defined, and it is important to confirm the observed changes in a larger study to gain further insights into the molecular alterations in PMD."
https://openalex.org/W2339353396,"Purpose Apart from germ-line BRCA1-mutated breast cancers, a significant proportion of women with sporadic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) sub-type are known to harbour varying levels of BRCA1-dysfuction. There is currently no established diagnostic method to identify these patients. Methods The analysis was performed on 183 primary breast cancer tumor specimens from our longitudinal case-series archived as formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks comprising 71 TNBCs and 112 Hormone receptor positive HER2 negative (HR+HER2-) tumors. Transcript levels of BRCA1 and two of its repressors ID4 and microRNA182 were determined by TaqMan quantitative PCR. BRCA1 protein was detected immunohistochemically with the MS110 antibody. Results The representation of BRCA1 and its repressor ID4 as a ratio led to improved separation of TNBCs from HR+HER2- compared to either measure by itself. We then dichotomised the continuous distribution of each of the three measurements (Protein, MIRNA and transcript:repressor ratio) into categories of deficient (0) and adequate (1). A composite BRCA1 Deficiency Score (BDS) was computed by the addition of the score for all three measures. Samples deficient on 2 or more measures were deemed to be BRCA1 deficient; and 40% of all TNBCs met this criterion. Conclusion We propose here a simple multi-level assay of BRCA1 deficiency using the BRCA1:ID4 ratio as a critical parameter that can be performed on FFPE samples in clinical laboratories by the estimation of only 3 bio-markers. The ease of testing will hopefully encourage adoption and clinical validation."

https://openalex.org/W2338460395,"In the current study we examine how individual differences in older adults’ global cognitive function impacts the extent to which their attitudes toward stigmatized individuals are malleable. Because prior research has elucidated the neural processes that are involved in evaluating stigmatized individuals who are responsible or not responsible for their condition, a cognitive neuroscience approach may be well-suited to answer this question. In the current study, 36 older and 17 young adults underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while evaluating images of homeless people who were described as being responsible or not responsible for their condition. They also indicated how much pity they felt for each of the individuals in order to determine the extent to which their attitudes were malleable (e.g., more pity for not-responsible as compared to responsible individuals). Participants’ cognitive function and baseline measure of their attitudes toward stigmatized individuals (including homeless individuals) were assessed. Results revealed that although older adults’ attitudes were malleable, the extent to which this was true varied due to individual differences in their global cognitive function. Specifically, the difference in the magnitude of older adults’ self-reported pity for not-responsible as compared to responsible homeless individuals was predicted by their global cognitive function. Moreover, the difference in pity that older adults expressed toward not-responsible as compared to responsible homeless individuals was related to activity in the left insula and the anterior cingulate cortex (regions implicated in empathy). These results suggest that attitude malleability is affected by individual differences in global cognitive function."
https://openalex.org/W2342105765,"The flowering periods of woody bamboos, seed set, natural regeneration and death after flowering have been rarely observed and evaluated in the field. Dendrocalamus membranaceus Munro, a tropical woody bamboo mainly distributed in the Yunnan, displayed both sporadic as well as gregarious (mass) flowering and fruited from 2006 to 2013 following severe droughts. The aim of this study is to examine potential differences in seed set and natural regeneration between the two flowering patterns in natural D. membranaceus forests. We investigated and analyzed seed set, seed germination, seedling growth and mortality in both mass and sporadic flowering populations. Observations were made over a period of three years to record changes in bamboo seedling density, height and culm diameter. We observed a low natural seed set ranging from 1.76% to 7.49%, and a relatively high seed germination rate in the nursery from 59.6% to 71.0% for both types of flowering populations. Seeds germinated in 5-7 days after sowing and the germination period lasted 10-15 days. Seed set and germination rates in mass-flowering populations were significantly higher than those of sporadically flowering stands. The seedlings within sporadically flowering populations died within two years. In comparison, seedling mortality in the mass flowering population increased over two periods of observation from 64.92% to 98.89%, yet there was good seedling establishment left over, which showed mean height and mean culm diameter increasing by 1053.25% and 410.71%, respectively, in the second year of observations, and 137.10%, and 217.48%, respectively, in the third year. There are significant differences in seed set, natural regeneration ability and sustainability of bamboo populations between the mass flowering and sporadically flowering populations of D. membranaceus. Sporadic flowering populations failed to produce effective regeneration, while mass flowering populations were able to regenerate successfully. This study provides useful insights for conservation and natural forest management of D. membranaceus. We consider the merits of introducing other genetic provenances towards long-term maintenance of the stand features at sporadically flowering sites; meanwhile, the most economic option for mass flowering stands is to allow natural regeneration to take place through protecting such sites from further disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W2338877407,"Evolution of gene regulation has been proposed to play an important role in environmental adaptation. Exploring mechanisms underlying coordinated evolutionary changes at various levels of gene regulation could shed new light on how organism adapt in nature. In this study, we focused on regulatory differences between a laboratory Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4742 and a pathogenic S. cerevisiae strain, YJM789. The two strains diverge in many features, including growth rate, morphology, high temperature tolerance, and pathogenicity. Our RNA-Seq and ribosomal footprint profiling data showed that gene expression differences are pervasive, and genes functioning in mitochondria are mostly divergent between the two strains at both transcriptional and translational levels. Combining functional genomics data from other yeast strains, we further demonstrated that significant divergence of expression for genes functioning in the electron transport chain (ETC) was likely caused by differential expression of a transcriptional factor, HAP4, and that post-transcriptional regulation mediated by an RNA-binding protein, PUF3, likely led to expression divergence for genes involved in mitochondrial translation. We also explored mito-nuclear interactions via mitochondrial DNA replacement between strains. Although the two mitochondrial genomes harbor substantial sequence divergence, neither growth nor gene expression were affected by mitochondrial DNA replacement in both fermentative and respiratory growth media, indicating compatible mitochondrial and nuclear genomes between these two strains in the tested conditions. Collectively, we used mitochondrial functions as an example to demonstrate for the first time that evolution at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels could lead to coordinated regulatory changes underlying strain specific functional variations."

In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of cardiac enzymes in combination with established prognostic factors in predicting the 7-day mortality rate of patients with septic shock, and we constructed a new scoring system, Septic Oncologic Patients in Emergency Department (SOPED), which includes cardiac enzymes, to predict 7-day mortality rates.We performed a retrospective cohort study of 375 adult cancer patients with septic shock who visited the emergency department of a comprehensive cancer center between 01/01/2004 and 12/31/2013. The 7-day and 28-day mortality rates were 19.7% and 37.6%, respectively. The creatine kinase myocardial band fraction and troponin-I were significantly higher in patients who died in ≤7 days and ≤28 days than in those who did not. In Cox regression models, troponin-I >0.05 ng/mL plus Predisposition, Infection, Response, and Organ Failure (PIRO2011) or Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) score was a significant predictor of survival for ≤7 days. With our new SOPED scoring system, the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve was 0.836, higher than those for PIRO2011 and MEDS.Troponin-I >0.05 ng/mL was an important predictor of short-term mortality (≤7 days). The SOPED scoring system, which incorporated troponin-I, was more prognostically accurate than were other scores for 7-day mortality. Large multicenter studies are needed to verify our results and prospectively validate the prognostic performance of the SOPED score."
https://openalex.org/W2338760546,"The dyskinesia of Parkinson's Disease is most likely due to excess levels of dopamine in the striatum. The mechanism may be due to aberrant synthesis but also, a deficiency or absence of the Dopamine Transporter. In this study we have examined the proposition that reinstating Dopamine Transporter expression in the striatum would reduce dyskinesia. We transplanted c17.2 cells that stably expressed the Dopamine Transporter into dyskinetic rats. There was a reduction in dyskinesia in rats that received grafts expressing the Dopamine Transporter. Strategies designed to increase Dopamine Transporter in the striatum may be useful in treating the dyskinesia associated with human Parkinson's Disease."

https://openalex.org/W2336451744,"This paper investigates institutional change in the Polish public science system (PPSS) in the past twenty years. Employing macro-statistical data, the paper argues that this change process has unfolded stepwise and relatively late despite major political and economic transformations in post-socialist Poland. Using a historical-institutionalist perspective, the paper focuses on processes of institutional change, including layering, displacement, and dismantling. One major finding is that the speed and depth of the gradual transformation differs considerably between the three research performing sectors of the Polish public science system. As the Polish Academy of Sciences was reproduced institutionally, the former governmental units for applied R&D were partly dismantled and displaced by private sector R&D units. In contrast, the Higher Education sector underwent a strong expansion and, thus, layering of new research activities and fields. Since policy shifts within the PPSS occurred relatively late, the more than two decades following the collapse of communism are of special interest to scholars of incremental, yet cumulative, institutional change."
https://openalex.org/W2337415263,"Vertebrate MOXD2 encodes a monooxygenase DBH-like 2 protein that could be involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, potentially during olfactory transduction. Loss of MOXD2 in apes and whales has been proposed to be associated with evolution of olfaction in these clades. We analyzed 57 bird genomes to identify MOXD2 sequences and found frequent loss of MOXD2 in 38 birds. Among the 57 birds, 19 species appeared to have an intact MOXD2 that encoded a full-length protein; 32 birds had a gene with open reading frame-disrupting point mutations and/or exon deletions; and the remaining 6 species did not show any MOXD2 sequence, suggesting a whole-gene deletion. Notably, among 10 passerine birds examined, 9 species shared a common genomic deletion that spanned several exons, implying the gene loss occurred in a common ancestor of these birds. However, 2 closely related penguin species, each of which had an inactive MOXD2, did not share any mutation, suggesting an independent loss after their divergence. Distribution of the 38 birds without an intact MOXD2 in the bird phylogenetic tree clearly indicates that MOXD2 loss is widespread and independent in bird lineages. We propose that widespread MOXD2 loss in some bird lineages may be implicated in the evolution of olfactory perception in these birds."
