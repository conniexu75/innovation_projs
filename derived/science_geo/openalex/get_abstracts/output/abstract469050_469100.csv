https://openalex.org/W2081855136,"In vitro, β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides form polymorphic fibrils, with molecular structures that depend on growth conditions, plus various oligomeric and protofibrillar aggregates. Here, we investigate structures of human brain-derived Aβ fibrils, using seeded fibril growth from brain extract and data from solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and electron microscopy. Experiments on tissue from two Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with distinct clinical histories showed a single predominant 40 residue Aβ (Aβ40) fibril structure in each patient; however, the structures were different from one another. A molecular structural model developed for Aβ40 fibrils from one patient reveals features that distinguish in-vivo- from in-vitro-produced fibrils. The data suggest that fibrils in the brain may spread from a single nucleation site, that structural variations may correlate with variations in AD, and that structure-specific amyloid imaging agents may be an important future goal."
https://openalex.org/W2135592618,"Recognition of injured mitochondria for degradation by macroautophagy is essential for cellular health, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Cardiolipin is an inner mitochondrial membrane phospholipid. We found that rotenone, staurosporine, 6-hydroxydopamine and other pro-mitophagy stimuli caused externalization of cardiolipin to the mitochondrial surface in primary cortical neurons and SH-SY5Y cells. RNAi knockdown of cardiolipin synthase or of phospholipid scramblase-3, which transports cardiolipin to the outer mitochondrial membrane, decreased the delivery of mitochondria to autophagosomes. Furthermore, we found that the autophagy protein microtubule-associated-protein-1 light chain 3 (LC3), which mediates both autophagosome formation and cargo recognition, contains cardiolipin-binding sites important for the engulfment of mitochondria by the autophagic system. Mutation of LC3 residues predicted as cardiolipin-interaction sites by computational modelling inhibited its participation in mitophagy. These data indicate that redistribution of cardiolipin serves as an 'eat-me' signal for the elimination of damaged mitochondria from neuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2163832829,"Cell surface growth factor receptors couple environmental cues to the regulation of cytoplasmic homeostatic processes, including autophagy, and aberrant activation of such receptors is a common feature of human malignancies. Here, we defined the molecular basis by which the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase regulates autophagy. Active EGFR binds the autophagy protein Beclin 1, leading to its multisite tyrosine phosphorylation, enhanced binding to inhibitors, and decreased Beclin 1-associated VPS34 kinase activity. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy disrupts Beclin 1 tyrosine phosphorylation and binding to its inhibitors and restores autophagy in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells with a TKI-sensitive EGFR mutation. In NSCLC tumor xenografts, the expression of a tyrosine phosphomimetic Beclin 1 mutant leads to reduced autophagy, enhanced tumor growth, tumor dedifferentiation, and resistance to TKI therapy. Thus, oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases directly regulate the core autophagy machinery, which may contribute to tumor progression and chemoresistance."
https://openalex.org/W2064752763,"After myocardial infarction, inflammatory cells are rapidly recruited to the heart and strongly affect the course of recovery. Ziad Mallat and his colleagues uncover a pathogenic role for B cells after myocardial infarction, showing that infarction triggers B cell secretion of the chemokine Ccl7, which mobilizes monocytes from the bone marrow, increases their recruitment to the heart and impairs heart function. Acute myocardial infarction is a severe ischemic disease responsible for heart failure and sudden death. Here, we show that after acute myocardial infarction in mice, mature B lymphocytes selectively produce Ccl7 and induce Ly6Chi monocyte mobilization and recruitment to the heart, leading to enhanced tissue injury and deterioration of myocardial function. Genetic (Baff receptor deficiency) or antibody-mediated (CD20- or Baff-specific antibody) depletion of mature B lymphocytes impeded Ccl7 production and monocyte mobilization, limited myocardial injury and improved heart function. These effects were recapitulated in mice with B cell–selective Ccl7 deficiency. We also show that high circulating concentrations of CCL7 and BAFF in patients with acute myocardial infarction predict increased risk of death or recurrent myocardial infarction. This work identifies a crucial interaction between mature B lymphocytes and monocytes after acute myocardial ischemia and identifies new therapeutic targets for acute myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W1994423882,"Autophagic protein degradation is mediated by autophagosomes that fuse with lysosomes, where their contents are degraded. The membrane origins of autophagosomes may involve multiple sources. However, it is unclear if and where distinct membrane sources fuse during autophagosome biogenesis. Vesicles containing mATG9, the only transmembrane autophagy protein, are seen in many sites, and fusions with other autophagic compartments have not been visualized in mammalian cells. We observed that mATG9 traffics from the plasma membrane to recycling endosomes in carriers that appear to be routed differently from ATG16L1-containing vesicles, another source of autophagosome membrane. mATG9- and ATG16L1-containing vesicles traffic to recycling endosomes, where VAMP3-dependent heterotypic fusions occur. These fusions correlate with autophagosome formation, and both processes are enhanced by perturbing membrane egress from recycling endosomes. Starvation, a primordial autophagy activator, reduces membrane recycling from recycling endosomes and enhances mATG9-ATG16L1 vesicle fusion. Thus, this mechanism may fine-tune physiological autophagic responses."
https://openalex.org/W2153825225,"Defects in DNA repair have been extensively linked to neurodegenerative diseases, but the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. We found that FUS, an RNA/DNA-binding protein that has been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is important for the DNA damage response (DDR). The function of FUS in DDR involved a direct interaction with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and the recruitment of FUS to double-stranded break sites was important for proper DDR signaling. Notably, FUS proteins carrying familial ALS mutations were defective in DDR and DNA repair and showed a diminished interaction with HDAC1. Moreover, we observed increased DNA damage in human ALS patients harboring FUS mutations. Our findings suggest that an impaired DDR and DNA repair may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases linked to FUS mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2060767100,"Johanna Seddon, Soumya Raychaudhuri and colleagues report the identification of rare variants in C3, CFI and C9 associated with risk of advanced age-related macular degeneration. To define the role of rare variants in advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) risk, we sequenced the exons of 681 genes within all reported AMD loci and related pathways in 2,493 cases and controls. We first tested each gene for increased or decreased burden of rare variants in cases compared to controls. We found that 7.8% of AMD cases compared to 2.3% of controls are carriers of rare missense CFI variants (odds ratio (OR) = 3.6; P = 2 × 10−8). There was a predominance of dysfunctional variants in cases compared to controls. We then tested individual variants for association with disease. We observed significant association with rare missense alleles in genes other than CFI. Genotyping in 5,115 independent samples confirmed associations with AMD of an allele in C3 encoding p.Lys155Gln (replication P = 3.5 × 10−5, OR = 2.8; joint P = 5.2 × 10−9, OR = 3.8) and an allele in C9 encoding p.Pro167Ser (replication P = 2.4 × 10−5, OR = 2.2; joint P = 6.5 × 10−7, OR = 2.2). Finally, we show that the allele of C3 encoding Gln155 results in resistance to proteolytic inactivation by CFH and CFI. These results implicate loss of C3 protein regulation and excessive alternative complement activation in AMD pathogenesis, thus informing both the direction of effect and mechanistic underpinnings of this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2092986760,"The extensive links between proteotoxic stress, protein aggregation and pathologies ranging from ageing to neurodegeneration underscore the importance of understanding how cells manage protein misfolding. Using live-cell imaging, we determine the fate of stress-induced misfolded proteins from their initial appearance until their elimination. Upon denaturation, misfolded proteins are sequestered from the bulk cytoplasm into dynamic endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated puncta that move and coalesce into larger structures in an energy-dependent but cytoskeleton-independent manner. These puncta, which we name Q-bodies, concentrate different misfolded and stress-denatured proteins en route to degradation, but do not contain amyloid aggregates, which localize instead to the insoluble protein deposit compartment. Q-body formation and clearance depends on an intact cortical ER and a complex chaperone network that is affected by rapamycin and impaired during chronological ageing. Importantly, Q-body formation enhances cellular fitness during stress. We conclude that spatial sequestration of misfolded proteins in Q-bodies is an early quality control strategy occurring synchronously with degradation to clear the cytoplasm of potentially toxic species."

At the smallest scale, up to a few hundred kilobases (kb) of linear DNA, enhancers and promoters come into physical contact to establish cell-type-specific expression programs (Sanyal et al., 2012Sanyal A.

These interactions are maintained by the Cohesin complex, which can be recruited to interphase chromatin via the Mediator complex (Kagey et al., 2010Kagey M.H. Newman J.J. Bilodeau S. Zhan Y.

In mammals, promoter-enhancer interactions are confined to topologically associating domains (TADs), which typically represent ∼1 megabase (Mb) cell-type-invariant, self-associating genomic regions whose boundaries are enriched for the insulator protein CTCF (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B.

As a second level of the organizational hierarchy, TADs appear to function as the fundamental modular unit of gene regulation and genome organization, with changes in gene expression and nuclear lamina association during differentiation often occurring in a TAD-wide manner (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B.

A third level in the organizational hierarchy occurs as a result of the preferential colocalization of specific TADs. These interactions can be identified as long-range chromatin contacts between genomic regions many Mb apart on the same chromosome (cis or intrachromosomal) or on different chromosomes (trans or interchromosomal) (Hakim et al., 2011Hakim O.

Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 944-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the relationship between long-range chromatin interactions and the regulatory features enriched in the colocalizing regions is poorly understood. Superimposed upon the milieu of specific short- and long-range chromatin interactions is a general preference for open, accessible chromatin to colocalize with itself and segregate away from closed, inaccessible chromatin (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009Lieberman-Aiden E. van Berkum N.L. Williams L. Imakaev M. Ragoczy T. Telling A. Amit I. Lajoie B.R. Sabo P.J. Dorschner M.O. et al.Comprehensive mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome.Science. 2009; 326: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (4907) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored long-range (distal) chromatin contacts in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using 4C-seq to understand the relationship between chromatin contacts and gene-regulatory networks that govern cell identity. We define the distal chromatin interactions made by a variety of genomic “bait” regions representing diverse chromatin and pluripotency TF binding profiles and extend our findings genome-wide. We further examine how genome organization changes in the absence of a critical chromatin regulator and upon differentiation and transcription-factor-induced reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Together, our data define a previously unappreciated hierarchy in the organization of long-range chromatin contacts and reveal that distal genomic regions sharing common gene-regulatory features colocalize within the 3D space of the nucleus. To investigate long-range chromatin interactions between genomic regions Mb away on the same or different chromosomes in ESCs, we performed 3C coupled to high-throughput sequencing (4C-seq) (Splinter et al., 2012Splinter E. de Wit E. van de Werken H.J. Klous P. de Laat W. Determining long-range chromatin interactions for selected genomic sites using 4C-seq technology: From fixation to computation.Methods. 2012; 58: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) for 16 bait regions (Table S1 available online). 4C-seq allows one to identify any mappable genomic region in close physical proximity to a specific genomic (bait) region within a population of cells at the moment of fixation by means of proximity-based ligation of juxtaposed DNA fragments. The product is a library of chimeric DNA fragments containing the bait region and its interacting DNA partner or partners ligated at a restriction site, in our case HindIII, that can be identified by high-throughput sequencing (Experimental Procedures). Our 4C-seq data were highly reproducible across biological and technical replicates utilizing distinct primer pairs for amplification of ligated fragments and different HindIII fragments within bait regions as anchor points and passed stringent quality control requirements (Figures S1A, S1D, S1E, and S2A available online, Table S2 and Table S3, and Experimental Procedures). As a result, replicate data sets for each bait locus were pooled for downstream analysis (Experimental Procedures). To obtain a semiquantitative measure of interactions, we calculated an average hit probability, referred to as “hit percentage,” within 200 kb windows along the genome (Experimental Procedures). For all of our baits, the hit percentage was higher in cis than in trans, as exemplified by the 4C-seq interactome of the Pou5f1-encoding region (Figure 1Ai). Furthermore, as expected for the nature of chromosome conformation (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009Lieberman-Aiden E. van Berkum N.L. Williams L. Imakaev M. Ragoczy T. Telling A. Amit I. Lajoie B.R. Sabo P.J. Dorschner M.O. et al.Comprehensive mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome.Science. 2009; 326: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (4907) Google Scholar), intrachromosomal interactions decay as a function of genomic distance to the bait along the linear DNA (Figure 1Aii). Significantly interacting regions were identified as those 200 kb windows that showed a markedly higher hit probability than expected based on a binomial test (Figures 1Aii–1Av, 1B, Figure S3A, Table S1, Table S4, Experimental Procedures). To identify distal interactions in cis, we empirically modeled the expected background hit probability as a function of distance from the bait locus (Figure 1Aiii). Since trans interactions show no such positional biases, the average hit probability across each trans-chromosome was used for the expected background level of these interactions. False discovery rates (FDRs) were estimated using simulated data (Table S4, Experimental Procedures). To test the reliability of our analysis and 4C-seq data, we partitioned our Pou5f1 4C-seq replicates into two equal subsets, pooled the libraries within each subset, and ran each pooled subset through our analysis pipeline. We obtained significantly overlapping intrachromosomal and interchromosomal interactomes from the partitioned data sets (Figure S1B), confirming the quality of our data and the robust nature of our analysis. Several additional approaches were employed to further validate our 4C-seq-defined chromatin interactions and rule out technical biases affecting data generated by 4C-seq. These include 3C confirmation of ligation products (Figure S1F); 3D fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrating that an interacting region 52 Mb away from the Pou5f1 bait region is significantly closer to the bait in 3D space of the ESC nucleus than a noninteracting region located only 35 Mb away (Figure 1C); reciprocal 4C-seq (Figure 1D); control 4C-seq experiments with unfixed cells and genomic DNA showing no significant interactions (Figures S1A and S1C); the demonstration of comparable mappability inside and outside our interacting regions (Figure S1G); and the comparison of our 4C-seq data with a previously published genome-wide ESC interactome based on Hi-C (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B. Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3992) Google Scholar) showing strong correlation (Figure 3H, Table S5, Experimental Procedures). The Pou5f1 gene encodes the TF Oct4 that is essential for the establishment and maintenance of mouse ESCs and is specifically expressed in the pluripotent state (Nichols et al., 1998Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D. Chambers I. Schöler H. Smith A. Formation of pluripotent stem cells in the mammalian embryo depends on the POU transcription factor Oct4.Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2683) Google Scholar). The initial analysis of our Pou5f1 4C-seq data revealed an extensive intrachromosomal interaction network of this bait region (Figure 1A), raising the question of how the spatial interactions of this important locus are regulated. As a first step toward understanding this question, we determined whether the chromatin interactions of this genomic region change upon differentiation. 4C-seq in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) demonstrated that the Pou5f1 interactome in MEFs is distinct from that of ESCs, both in terms of hit probability (Figure 2A and Figure S2A) and interacting domains (Figure 2B) across the cis chromosome, indicating that changes in expression and chromatin state that are associated with the silencing of the Pou5f1 locus during differentiation (Feldman et al., 2006Feldman N. Gerson A. Fang J. Li E. Zhang Y. Shinkai Y. Cedar H. Bergman Y. G9a-mediated irreversible epigenetic inactivation of Oct-3/4 during early embryogenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) coincide with changes to that locus’ interactions in 3D space. To expand the purview of this analysis, we determined the interactomes of nine additional baits in MEFs for which we already had generated ESC profiles by 4C-seq and found that the interactomes of all these baits differed significantly between ESCs and MEFs (Figures 2E and 2F, Figure S2A, Table S1). We noted that the chromatin contacts of the Dppa2 bait region are much more different between MEFs and ESCs than those of the other examined bait regions (Figures 2C and 2D, Figure S2A). Consistent with this result, it has been shown that the Dppa2 region repositions toward the nuclear periphery and switches cis-interaction preferences from regions of early DNA replication to regions of late DNA replication during ESC differentiation (Hiratani et al., 2010Hiratani I. Ryba T. Itoh M. Rathjen J. Kulik M. Papp B. Fussner E. Bazett-Jones D.P. Plath K.

Dileep V. Ryba T. Dennis J.H. Gilbert D.M. Chromatin-interaction compartment switch at developmentally regulated chromosomal domains reveals an unusual principle of chromatin folding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 12574-12579Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Together, these data highlight an ESC-specific organization of the genome and indicate that changes in 3D chromatin interactions during differentiation are regulated at a locus-specific level. We next tested whether the 3D organization of the MEF genome can be reset to an ESC-like state by transcription-factor-mediated reprogramming to iPSCs (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18970) Google Scholar). To this end, we determined the interactomes of eight of our bait regions, including the Pou5f1 locus, for two additional cell types that represent distinct stages of the reprogramming process (Table S1). First, we performed 4C-seq on faithfully reprogrammed, MEF-derived iPSCs and found that the long-range chromatin contacts in iPSCs are highly similar to those of ESCs, in terms of both hit probability across the cis chromosome (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2E, Figure S2A) and interacting domains in cis and in trans to the bait region (Figures 2B, 2D, and 2F, Figure S2B). Second, we examined chromatin interactions in pre-iPSCs that represent a late reprogramming stage at which the pluripotency expression and chromatin program is not yet fully induced (Sridharan et al., 2009Sridharan R. Tchieu J. Mason M.J. Yachechko R. Kuoy E. Horvath S. Zhou Q. Plath K. Role of the murine reprogramming factors in the induction of pluripotency.Cell. 2009; 136: 364-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The long-range chromatin interactomes in these cells are typically distinct from those in ESCs and iPSCs, as well as those in MEFs (Figure 2, Figure S2), indicating that the reorganization of chromatin contacts is not complete at this late stage of reprogramming, in line with previous findings detailing the long-range interactions of the Nanog locus (Apostolou et al., 2013Apostolou E. Ferrari F. Walsh R.M. Bar-Nur O. Stadtfeld M. Cheloufi S. Stuart H.T. Polo J.M. Ohsumi T.K.

Together, these data show that the large-scale changes in genome organization that occur during differentiation are gradually reset to an ESC-like state during reprogramming to iPSCs, likely in association with progressive changes in chromatin and transcription states (Sridharan et al., 2009Sridharan R. Tchieu J. Mason M.J. Yachechko R. Kuoy E. Horvath S. Zhou Q. Plath K.

The cell-type specificity of long-range chromatin interactions contrasts with the largely cell-type invariant TAD structure of metazoan genomes (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A.

Three-dimensional folding and functional organization principles of the Drosophila genome.Cell. 2012; 148: 458-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar), suggesting that the organization of long-range chromatin contacts is a key feature of cell identity. The finding that changes in distal chromatin contacts occur during differentiation and reprogramming suggested a link between genome organization and genomic features that establish and maintain cell identity. To investigate such an association in the context of mouse ESCs, we compiled a compendium of genomic features available for this cell type (Table S6). Specifically, we considered the binding profiles of the basic transcriptional machinery (TBP, RNA polymerase II), coactivators (Mediator and p300), and architectural proteins (Cohesin and CTCF). We also included transcriptional regulators of three important gene-regulatory networks: the pluripotency TF network (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Klf4), TFs that cooperate with cMyc (cMyc, Max, E2F4), and the repressive Polycomb protein network (Ring1b and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 [PRC2]) (Young, 2011Young R.A. Control of the embryonic stem cell state.Cell. 2011; 144: 940-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Since regulatory genomic regions exhibit extensive co-occupancy by these factors, we grouped them into 11 groups (clusters) based on cobinding at a 1 kb resolution (Figure 3A, Experimental Procedures). We also took into account histone modifications and their combinatorial nature by summarizing the relationship of six histone marks in terms of four functionally distinct chromatin states (ChromHMM states) (Ernst and Kellis, 2012Ernst J. Kellis M. ChromHMM: automating chromatin-state discovery and characterization.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 215-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar) that are associated with Polycomb repression, transcriptional elongation, enhancers, and promoters. Regions lacking these histone modifications were assigned to a “low signal” state (Figure 3B, Experimental Procedures). In addition, DNA replication timing, DNaseI hypersensitivity, gene density (in terms of transcriptional start sites [TSSs]), RNA-seq- based expression data, and LaminB association were considered. Upon binning of the resulting 22 linear genomic data sets into 200 kb windows across the genome, principal components analysis (PCA) was used to reduce their high dimensionality (Experimental Procedures). The first three principal components (PCs) were retained for downstream analyses (Figure 3C). To explore the relationship between genomic features and genome organization, we next compared the linear genomic character represented by the PCs to the 4C interactome data for each of the 16 bait regions analyzed in ESCs (Figure S3A, Figure 1B, Table S1). The first PC (PC1) captures 51% of the variance across all features (Figure 3C) and distinguishes open, accessible chromatin and closed, inaccessible chromatin (Figure 3D). Specifically, regions of the genome with positive PC1 scores are characterized by high gene density, DNaseI hypersensitivity, binding of Cohesin, the basic transcriptional machinery, and TFs, as well as active or Polycomb-repressed chromatin states within 200 kb windows. In contrast, regions of the genome with negative PC1 scores are strongly depleted for these features and instead are LaminB associated and replicate their DNA late in S phase (Figure 3D). Notably, the 1 Mb regions surrounding each bait locus had widely differing open/closed chromatin character as defined by their PC1 scores (Figure 3Ei, top panel). Strikingly, we found that the mean PC1 scores for the 1 Mb bait regions correlated strongly with the mean PC1 scores of the corresponding interactomes in both cis and trans (Figure 3Ei, Spearman’s rho = 0.75 and 0.85, respectively). That is, baits with highly open and accessible chromatin preferentially interact with regions of the genome with similarly high PC1 scores. By contrast, the interactomes of closed chromatin baits, i.e., those with negative PC1 scores, preferentially colocalize with genomic regions of similarly low PC1 scores in cis and trans. These findings were confirmed by a 4C-seq analysis for a partially overlapping set of bait regions in a second, independent ESC line (Figure 3Eii). To test whether this trend holds genome-wide, we analyzed a previously published Hi-C data set for genome-wide chromatin interactions in mouse ESCs (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B. Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3992) Google Scholar) in a similar manner (Experimental Procedures). For the Hi-C-based analysis, each 200 kb region of the genome was treated as a “pseudo-bait” and its intrachromosomal interactome was extracted (Figure 3F). Genome-wide, we found a striking positive correlation between the mean PC1 scores of the extended 1 Mb pseudo-bait regions and the mean PC1 scores of their most frequently interacting intrachromosomal sites (Figure 3G), corroborating and extending our 4C-seq-based findings. A comparison of the profiles of the most and least likely interacting regions further demonstrated that genomic regions with very open, high PC1 character, for instance the Pou5f1 region, interact extensively with most other genomic regions with similarly high PC1 scores on the chromosome in cis and do not interact with genomic regions of negative PC1 scores (Figures 3G and 3H, Figure S3Ci). In contrast, genomic regions of closed chromatin character, defined by negative PC1 scores, avoid regions of high PC1 character and appear to interact selectively with only a subset of PC1-negative genomic regions (Figure S3Ci). This may reflect a tethering of closed chromatin regions to the nuclear lamina, thus limiting their sampling of distal interactions. The positive correlation between bait and interactome characte"

We have established a highly multiplexed, quantitative PCR assay to profile in an unbiased manner a panel of all commonly used cell surface markers (280 genes) from individual cells. With this method, we analyzed over 1,500 single cells throughout the mouse hematopoietic system and illustrate its utility for revealing important biological insights. The comprehensive single cell data set permits mapping of the mouse hematopoietic stem cell differentiation hierarchy by computational lineage progression analysis. Further profiling of 180 intracellular regulators enabled construction of a genetic network to assign the earliest differentiation event during hematopoietic lineage specification.

This variability critically determines the impact a disease has on a patient's life but is very poorly understood. Here, we exploit existing genome-wide association study data to gain insight into the role of genetics in prognosis. We identify a noncoding polymorphism in FOXO3A (rs12212067: T > G) at which the minor (G) allele, despite not being associated with disease susceptibility, is associated with a milder course of Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis and with increased risk of severe malaria. Minor allele carriage is shown to limit inflammatory responses in monocytes via a FOXO3-driven pathway, which through TGFβ1 reduces production of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, and increases production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10. Thus, we uncover a shared genetic contribution to prognosis in distinct diseases that operates via a FOXO3-driven pathway modulating inflammatory responses."

INO80 has an embryo-shaped head-neck-body-foot architecture and shows dynamic open and closed conformations. We can assign an Rvb1/Rvb2 heterododecamer to the head in close contact with the Ino80 Snf2 domain, Ies2, and the Arp5 module at the neck. The high-affinity nucleosome-binding Nhp10 module localizes to the body, whereas the module that contains actin, Arp4, and Arp8 maps to the foot. Structural and biochemical analyses indicate that the nucleosome is bound at the concave surface near the neck, flanked by the Rvb1/2 and Arp8 modules. Our analysis establishes a structural and functional framework for this family of large remodelers."

The Swc2 subunit of SWR-C bound a narrowly defined region in the adjacent nucleosome-free region (NFR), where it positioned the Swr1 subunit over one of two sites of H2A.Z deposition at +1. The genomic binding maps suggest that many subunits have a rather plastic organization that allows subunits to exchange between the two complexes. One outcome of promoting H2A/H2A.Z exchange was an enhanced turnover of entire nucleosomes, thereby creating dynamic chromatin at the start of genes. Our findings provide unifying concepts on how these two opposing chromatin remodeling complexes function selectively at the +1 nucleosome of nearly all genes."

Contrary to previous reports, we find that significantly lower numbers of ""working"" stem cells are present in the intestinal epithelium (five to seven per crypt) and in adenomas (nine per gland), and that those stem cells are also replaced at a significantly lower rate.

https://openalex.org/W2043940450,"The histone variant H2A.Z is a genome-wide signature of nucleosomes proximal to eukaryotic regulatory DNA. Whereas the multisubunit chromatin remodeler SWR1 is known to catalyze ATP-dependent deposition of H2A.Z, the mechanism of SWR1 recruitment to S. cerevisiae promoters has been unclear. A sensitive assay for competitive binding of dinucleosome substrates revealed that SWR1 preferentially binds long nucleosome-free DNA and the adjoining nucleosome core particle, allowing discrimination of gene promoters over gene bodies. Analysis of mutants indicates that the conserved Swc2/YL1 subunit and the adenosine triphosphatase domain of Swr1 are mainly responsible for binding to substrate. SWR1 binding is enhanced on nucleosomes acetylated by the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase, but recognition of nucleosome-free and nucleosomal DNA is dominant over interaction with acetylated histones. Such hierarchical cooperation between DNA and histone signals expands the dynamic range of genetic switches, unifying classical gene regulation by DNA-binding factors with ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling and posttranslational histone modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2015058678,"Radial glial progenitors (RGPs) are elongated epithelial cells that give rise to neurons, glia, and adult stem cells during brain development. RGP nuclei migrate basally during G1, apically using cytoplasmic dynein during G2, and undergo mitosis at the ventricular surface. By live imaging of in utero electroporated rat brain, we find that two distinct G2-specific mechanisms for dynein nuclear pore recruitment are essential for apical nuclear migration. The ""RanBP2-BicD2"" and ""Nup133-CENP-F"" pathways act sequentially, with Nup133 or CENP-F RNAi arresting nuclei close to the ventricular surface in a premitotic state. Forced targeting of dynein to the nuclear envelope rescues nuclear migration and cell-cycle progression, demonstrating that apical nuclear migration is not simply correlated with cell-cycle progression from G2 to mitosis, but rather, is a required event. These results reveal that cell-cycle control of apical nuclear migration occurs by motor protein recruitment and identify a role for nucleus- and centrosome-associated forces in mitotic entry.

We hypothesize that decoding occurs by modulation of signaling through changes in plasma membrane curvature. Using analytical approaches and numerical simulations, we studied how elongation of cell shape affects plasma membrane signaling. Mathematical analyses reveal transient accumulation of activated receptors at regions of higher curvature with increasing cell eccentricity. This distribution of activated receptors is periodic, following the Mathieu function, and it arises from local imbalance between reaction and diffusion of soluble ligands and receptors in the plane of the membrane. Numerical simulations show that transient microdomains of activated receptors amplify signals to downstream protein kinases. For growth factor receptor pathways, increasing cell eccentricity elevates the levels of activated cytoplasmic Src and nuclear MAPK1,2. These predictions were experimentally validated by changing cellular eccentricity, showing that shape is a locus of retrievable information storage in cells."

We also show that SWR1 undergoes a large conformational change upon engaging a limited region of the nucleosome core particle.

We demonstrate that loss of NHE6 results in overacidification of the endosomal compartment and attenuated TrkB signaling. Mouse brains with disrupted NHE6 display reduced axonal and dendritic branching, synapse number, and circuit strength. Site-directed mutagenesis shows that the proton leak function of NHE6 is required for neuronal arborization. We find that TrkB receptor colocalizes to NHE6-associated endosomes. TrkB protein and phosphorylation are reduced in NHE6 mutant neurons in response to BDNF signaling. Finally, exogenous BDNF rescues defects in neuronal arborization.

We have previously reported that both global targeting along the A-P axis and local sorting of OSN axons for glomerular segregation are regulated by OR-derived cAMP (Imai and Sakano, 2008Imai T. Sakano H. Odorant receptor-mediated signaling in the mouse.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the OB, A-P-targeting molecules such as Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) and Plexin-A1 (PlxnA1) are detected on axon termini of OSNs, forming a complementary gradient in a glomerular map (Imai et al., 2006Imai T.

Odorant receptor-mediated signaling in the mouse.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). OR-derived cAMP signals also regulate the expression of glomerular segregation molecules (e.g., Kirrel2 and Kirrel3) for olfactory map refinement (Serizawa et al., 2006Serizawa S. Miyamichi K.

Unlike A-P-targeting molecules, glomerular segregation molecules are regulated in a neuronal activity-dependent manner and show mosaic distribution in the glomerular map. How is it, then, that A-P targeting and glomerular segregation are differentially regulated by the expressed ORs although both are under the control of OR-derived cAMP? What is the source of cAMP signals, and how are the signals generated? These important questions had never been formally addressed. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including ORs, are known to possess two different conformation states, active and inactive. Agonists stabilize the receptor in an active form, whereas inverse agonists stabilize it in an inactive form (Bond and Ijzerman, 2006Bond R.A. Ijzerman A.P.

Conformational complexity of G-protein-coupled receptors.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 397-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In the absence of agonists and inverse agonists, GPCRs produce a baseline level of cAMP by spontaneously flipping between active and inactive conformations. For different OR species, variable but specific levels of constitutive activities have been reported (Kato et al., 2008Kato A. Katada S. Touhara K.

Physiol. 2010; 136: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In humans, a number of examples of endocrine diseases are known where the agonist-independent receptor activity is elevated by mutations in GPCRs (Vassart and Costagliola, 2011Vassart G.

However, the agonist-independent activity had long been considered to be noise created by GPCRs, and its functional role was not fully appreciated. Here, we study the possible role of agonist-independent GPCR activity in the receptor-instructed axonal projection. In the canonical signal transduction pathway, ORs couple to a heterotrimeric G protein, Golf, converting guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) (Imai and Sakano, 2008Imai T. Sakano H. Odorant receptor-mediated signaling in the mouse.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound Golf, then stimulates adenylyl cyclase type III (ACIII), leading to cAMP production. In the knockout (KO) mouse deficient for ACIII, Nrp1 and Kirrel2 expression was downregulated (Col et al., 2007Col J.A. Matsuo T. Storm D.R. Rodriguez I. Adenylyl cyclase-dependent axonal targeting in the olfactory system.Development. 2007; 134: 2481-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), whereas PlxnA1 and Kirrel3 expression was upregulated (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1C available online). Interestingly, expression levels of glomerular segregation molecules (e.g., Kirrel2 and Kirrel3) were affected by unilateral naris occlusion. In the occluded naris, Kirrel2 was downregulated and Kirrel3 was upregulated, whereas transcription of A-P-targeting genes, Nrp1 and PlxnA1, was not affected (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1C). These results indicate that stimulus-driven activity contributes to the local sorting of OSN axons for glomerular segregation but does not affect global targeting along the A-P axis.Figure S1In Situ Hybridization of OE Sections, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) OE sections from the wild-type (WT) and ACIII KO were analyzed for the expression of Nrp1, PlxnA1, Kirrel2 and Kirrel3 genes (top).

In the naris occlusion experiment (middle), one nostril was surgically occluded at P5, and expression of Nrp1, PlxnA1, Kirrel2, and Kirrel3 genes in the OE was analyzed by in situ hybridization at P14. The contralateral non-occluded OE was analyzed as a control (open). Naris occlusion affected the transcription of glomerular segregation molecules, but not that of A-P targeting molecules: Kirrel2 was downregulated whereas Kirrel3 was upregulated in the occluded OE.

We examined whether odorous stimuli can change the expression profile of A-P targeting and glomerular segregation molecules (Figure 1B) using the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse in which the MOR29B gene is tagged with IRES-gapEYFP. The transgenic mice were housed in the presence of vanillin, a ligand for MOR29B (Tsuboi et al., 2011Tsuboi A. Imai T. Kato H.K. Matsumoto H. Igarashi K.M. Suzuki M. Mori K. Sakano H. Two highly homologous mouse odorant receptors encoded by tandemly-linked MOR29A and MOR29B genes respond differently to phenyl ethers.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2011; 33: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), for 10 days. In control mice not exposed to vanillin, MOR29B glomeruli ranked in the 30th percentile from the lowest Kirrel2-staining intensity among ∼300 glomeruli analyzed. In contrast, when the mice were exposed to vanillin, the ranking went up to 60th percentile from the lowest. Ranking did not change for the control OR, MOR28, in the same animal. Interestingly, Nrp1 expression was not affected by vanillin exposure in the MOR29B-positive OSNs. These results indicate that the expression of glomerular segregation molecules is regulated by ligand-induced signals, whereas the expression of A-P-targeting molecules is likely to be driven by ligand-independent activity. It has been reported that overexpression of the inward-rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 hyperpolarizes neurons and thus completely inhibits the generation of action potentials (Johns et al., 1999Johns D.C. Marx R. Mains R.E. O’Rourke B. Marbán E. Inducible genetic suppression of neuronal excitability.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the Kir2.1-overexpressing mouse (Yu et al., 2004Yu C.R. Power J. Barnea G. O’Donnell S. Brown H.E. Osborne J. Axel R. Gogos J.A. Spontaneous neural activity is required for the establishment and maintenance of the olfactory sensory map.Neuron. 2004; 42: 553-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), Kirrel2 was downregulated, but Nrp1 expression was not affected (Figures 1C and S1B). We analyzed the glomerular formation in the Kir2.1 mutant mouse. The glomerular structure became more diffuse than normal, but A-P targeting was unaffected (Figure 1C). The Kir2.1 experiments reveal that neuronal firing is not responsible for OR-instructed A-P targeting. What kind of activity regulates A-P targeting, then? It has been reported that GPCRs spontaneously alternate between two different conformational states, active and inactive, thereby generating unique levels of cAMP in the absence of agonists and inverse agonists (Bond and Ijzerman, 2006Bond R.A.

Origin of basal activity in mammalian olfactory receptor neurons.J. Gen. Physiol. 2010; 136: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). We hypothesized that the agonist-independent OR activity may participate in the regulation of A-P targeting of OSN axons. In order to examine this possibility, we attempted to generate the activity mutants of GPCRs. The initial experiment with ORs was not successful due to the challenges of achieving adequate membrane expression in the heterologous system. In addition, due to the vast diversity of OR family proteins and the lack of three-dimensional (3D) structural information, prediction and screening of activity mutants were difficult for OR molecules. In contrast, β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), a GPCR with the highest sequence homology to ORs, is easier to express in transfected cells and shares many functional similarities with ORs. When expressed in OSNs with the OR gene promoter, β2-AR maintains the one neuron-one receptor rule, couples with the α subunit of Gs or Golf, and substitutes ORs for receptor-instructed axonal projection (Feinstein et al., 2004Feinstein P. Bozza T. Rodriguez I. Vassalli A. Mombaerts P. Axon guidance of mouse olfactory sensory neurons by odorant receptors and the β2 adrenergic receptor.Cell. 2004; 117: 833-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Furthermore, β2-AR has advantages of being well characterized for distinct receptor functions. Based on mutational studies, the key amino acid residues in the β2-AR that are required for G protein coupling, ligand binding, and the generation of agonist-independent activity are well characterized (Ballesteros et al., 2001Ballesteros J.A.

Recently, the 3D structures of β2-AR in its active state and in a complex with a stimulatory G protein have been determined (Rasmussen et al., 2011aRasmussen S.G. Choi H.J. Fung J.J. Pardon E.

As a result of these favorable features, we selected β2-AR for the transgenic analysis of the agonist-independent GPCR activity in axonal projection of OSNs. In addition to β2-AR mutations previously described (Ballesteros et al., 2001Ballesteros J.A. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Rasmussen S.G. Shi L. Gether U. Javitch J.A. Activation of the β 2-adrenergic receptor involves disruption of an ionic lock between the cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane segments 3 and 6.J. Biol.

In vitro mutagenesis and the search for structure-function relationships among G protein-coupled receptors.Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), we introduced new mutations in the ligand-binding extracellular domain and G-protein-interacting transmembrane region. For these β2-AR mutants, we measured agonist-independent and agonist-dependent activities in the transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cell lines, where cAMP was quantified using a CRE-luc reporter assay (Saito et al., 2009Saito H.

Neurosci. 2011; 33: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). For the wild-type (WT) β2-AR, the level of agonist-independent activity was one order of magnitude lower than that of agonist-dependent activity. Among the β2-AR mutations analyzed, some affected both agonist-independent and agonist-dependent activities, whereas others affected only one of the two activities. We predict that mutations affecting G protein activation—e.g., DRY motif mutations—would alter both agonist-dependent and -independent activities, whereas those altering ligand interactions would change agonist-dependent activity. Mutations that affect equilibrium of conformational transitions should alter the agonist-independent receptor activity. For further transgenic studies, we selected three β2-AR mutants from the collection, which significantly altered agonist-independent receptor activity, but not the agonist-dependent activity (Figure 2C). The C327R contains a mutation at residue 327, replacing cysteine with arginine. Based on the 3D structural analysis (Rasmussen et al., 2011aRasmussen S.G. Choi H.J. Fung J.J. Pardon E. Casarosa P. Chae P.S. Devree B.T. Rosenbaum D.M. Thian F.S.

Calinski D. et al.Crystal structure of the β2 adrenergic receptor-Gs protein complex.Nature. 2011; 477: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2276) Google Scholar), we predict that this change makes entry tract for G protein narrower, thus lowering the agonist-independent activity to one-third that of the WT (Figure 2D, upper right). The Δ267–273 exhibits decreased agonist-independent activity due to the deletion of key residues that constitute the G protein entry gate (Figure 2D, lower left). In contrast, the E268A has increased agonist-independent activity more than 3-fold that of WT. This mutation, changing the residue from glutamic acid to alanine at position 268, removes the negative charge at the bottom of β2-AR. Loss of the ionic interaction with arginine at 131 breaks a lock on the entry gate for the G protein, making it looser (Figure 2D, lower right). This likely increases the frequency of turnover of G protein coupling to β2-AR, generating a higher level of agonist-independent activity. It is important to make certain that activity alterations are not due to changes in membrane expression of mutant protein. To confirm, we immunostained transfected HEK293 cells with antibodies against FLAG, an N-terminal epitope tag, and found that mutant receptors were detected on the cell surface at levels comparable to that of WT (Figure S2C). Membrane expression of β2-ARs was quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Measured agonist-independent activities were normalized to the surface expression levels for further studies. We then generated transgenic mice expressing the mutant or WT β2-AR using an OR gene promoter. This was performed by replacing the MOR23 coding sequence with that of β2-AR in the MOR23 minigene cassette (Figure S2A). We first checked β2-AR expression in OSNs of the transgenic mice. OE sections were isolated and stained with antibodies against β2-AR. Both the WT and mutant β2-ARs reacted equally to the β2-AR antibodies with no notable differences in their staining levels (Figure S2B, left). The level of mutant protein expression quantified by FACS was not affected by the mutations in the transgenic mice (Figure S2B, right). We next studied the glomerular locations in the OB for the mutant β2-ARs tagged with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) (Figure 3A). At least four independent transgenic mouse lines were generated for each β2-AR mutant. OSNs expressing the WT β2-AR tagged with ECFP generated a glomerulus halfway along the A-P axis of the OB (Figure 3A, left) and formed synapses with mitral cell dendrites (Figure S2D). To compare glomerular locations of mutant β2-ARs with that of the WT within the same animal, we crossed one of the WT β2-AR transgenic lines with each mutant line. The activity-low mutant, C327R (30% of WT), generated glomeruli (red) anterior to that of the WT (white). The shift was minor for another activity-low mutant, Δ267–273 (75% of WT) (Figure 3A, middle). In contrast, the activity-high mutation, E268A (350% of WT), caused a posterior shift of glomeruli (green) (Figure 3A, right). This finding shows a good correlation between the agonist-independent activities of β2-ARs and their corresponding glomerular locations along the A-P axis (Figures 3B and 3C). We also examined the expression levels of A-P-targeting molecules in the β2-AR glomeruli by immunostaining and performing quantitative PCR (qPCR) of FACS-sorted OSNs. As shown in Figure 4A, Nrp1 expression in β2-AR-expressing OSNs was increased by the activity-high mutation, E268A, but lowered by the activity-low mutations, C327R and Δ267–273. In contrast, PlxnA1 expression was downregulated by E268A but upregulated by C327R and Δ267–273. It is notable that expression levels of glomerular segregation molecules, e.g., Kirrel2 and Kirrel3, were not affected at all by these mutations (Figure 4B). Above observations, together with the result of naris occlusion (Figures 1A, right, and S1A, middle), suggest that A-P-targeting molecules and glomerular segregation molecules are separately regulated by two distinct OR-derived signals. To examine whether the correlation between the agonist-independent activities and glomerular locations holds true for natural ORs, we performed the following experiments. We dissected the mouse OB into three sections: anterior, middle, and posterior. Thirty"
https://openalex.org/W2059473757,"Alexander van Oudenaarden and colleagues analyze the temporal dynamics of the Caenorhabditis elegans transcriptome, reporting that ~2,000 genes show periodic expression oscillations in synchrony with progression through larval stages. They characterize the expression dynamics of the microRNA lin-4 and its target lin-14 and suggest that a microRNA-mediated feed-forward circuit is required for efficient dampening of expression oscillations to maintain the temporal gradient of the microRNA target. The complexity of multicellular organisms requires precise spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression during development. We find that in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans approximately 2,000 transcripts undergo expression oscillations synchronized with larval transitions while thousands of genes are expressed in temporal gradients, similar to known timing regulators. By counting transcripts in individual worms, we show that pulsatile expression of the microRNA (miRNA) lin-4 maintains the temporal gradient of its target lin-14 by dampening its expression oscillations. Our results demonstrate that this insulation is optimal when pulsatile expression of the miRNA and its target is synchronous. We propose that such a miRNA-mediated incoherent feed-forward loop is a potent filter that prevents the propagation of potentially deleterious fluctuations in gene expression during the development of an organism."
https://openalex.org/W2019237006,"Thymic selection requires signaling by the protein tyrosine kinase Lck to generate T cells expressing αβ T cell antigen receptors (TCR). For reasons not understood, the thymus selects only αβTCR that are restricted by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded determinants. Here, we report that Lck proteins that were coreceptor associated promoted thymic selection of conventionally MHC-restricted TCR, but Lck proteins that were coreceptor free promoted thymic selection of MHC-independent TCR. Transgenic TCR with MHC-independent specificity for CD155 utilized coreceptor-free Lck to signal thymic selection in the absence of MHC, unlike any transgenic TCR previously described. Thus, the thymus can select either MHC-restricted or MHC-independent αβTCR depending on whether Lck is coreceptor associated or coreceptor free. We conclude that the intracellular state of Lck determines the specificity of thymic selection and that Lck association with coreceptor proteins during thymic selection is the mechanism by which MHC restriction is imposed on a randomly generated αβTCR repertoire."
https://openalex.org/W2097143107,"Relaxin is a potent vasodilator of small resistance arteries and modifies arterial compliance in some systemic vascular beds, yet receptors for relaxin, such as RXFP1, have only been localized to vascular smooth muscle. This study first aimed to localize RXFP1 in rat arteries and veins from different organ beds and determine whether receptors are present in endothelial cells. We then tested the hypothesis that region-specific vascular effects of relaxin may be influenced by the cellular localization of RXFP1 within different blood vessels. The aorta, vena cava, mesenteric artery, and vein had significantly higher (P<0.05) RXFP1 immunostaining in endothelial cells compared with vascular smooth muscle, whereas the femoral artery and vein and small pulmonary arteries had higher (P<0.01) RXFP1 immunostaining in the vascular smooth muscle. Male rats were treated subcutaneously with recombinant human relaxin-2 (serelaxin; 4 μg/h) for 5 d; vasodilation and compliance in mesenteric and femoral arteries and veins were compared with placebo controls. Serelaxin significantly (P=0.04) reduced wall stiffness and increased volume compliance in mesenteric arteries but not in the other vessels examined. This was associated with changes in geometrical properties, and not compositional changes in the extracellular matrix. Serelaxin treatment had no effect on acetylcholine-mediated relaxation but significantly (P<0.001) enhanced bradykinin (BK)-mediated relaxation in mesenteric arteries, involving enhanced nitric oxide but not endothelium-derived hyperpolarization or vasodilatory prostanoids. In conclusion, there is differential distribution of RXFP1 on endothelial and smooth muscle across the vasculature. In rats, mesenteric arteries exhibit the greatest functional response to chronic serelaxin treatment."

The mitochondrial small and large ribosomal subunits contain 12 S and 16 S rRNAs encoded by mtDNA. These RNAs represent minimized versions of bacterial 16 S and 23 S rRNAs. In mitochondria, the rRNAs are assembled with ∼80 nucleus-encoded ribosomal proteins into 28 S and 39 S subunits that are relatively enriched in protein as compared with bacterial or eukaryotic ribosomes (1.Sharma M.R.

However, the number of post-transcriptional modifications observed for mammalian mitochondrial rRNAs is sharply diminished in comparison with bacterial and human cytoplasmic rRNAs, which contain 33 and over 200 modifications, respectively. Most of the modifications of mammalian rRNA are site-specific methylations first characterized by Dubin's laboratory using cultured BHK-21 hamster cells (6.Baer R.J. Dubin D.T.

Gustafsson C.M. Larsson N.-G. Methylation of 12S rRNA is necessary for in vivo stability of the small subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome.Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 386-397Google Scholar). Methylation of 12 S rRNA by TFB1M has recently been implicated in development of aminoglycoside-induced deafness (13.Raimundo N. Song L. Shutt T.E. McKay S.E. Cotney J. Guan M.-X. Gilliland T.C. Hohuan D. Santos-Sacchi J. Shadel G.S. Mitochondrial stress engages E2F1 apoptotic signaling to cause deafness.Cell. 2012; 148: 716-726Google Scholar). A second protein, ERAL1, has been shown to bind to a site overlapping the TFB1M methylation site, but its role in methylation or ribosome biogenesis is poorly understood (14.Dennerlein S. Rozanska A. Wydro M. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M. Lightowlers R.N. Human ERAL1 is a mitochondrial RNA chaperone involved in the assembly of the 28S small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit.Biochem. J. 2010; 430: 551-558Google Scholar, 15.Uchiumi T. Ohgaki K. Yagi M. Aoki Y. Sakai A. Matsumoto S. Kang D. ERAL1 is associated with mitochondrial ribosome and elimination of ERAL1 leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and growth retardation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5554-5568Google Scholar). The related prokaryotic Era protein is one of several GTPases that function in ribosome assembly (16.Kaczanowska M. Rydén-Aulin M. Ribosome biogenesis and the translation process in Escherichia coli.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 477-494Google Scholar). The large rRNA contains three sites of methylation of 2′-O-ribose residues, a GmG residue at G1144 or G1145 and UmGm at U1369G1370 of the human 16 S rRNA. These sites are conserved in bacterial and cytoplasmic rRNAs, where they stabilize RNA structures critical for the peptidyltransferase reaction and tRNA recognition (5.Decatur W.A. Fournier M.J. rRNA modifications and ribosome function.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 344-351Google Scholar). These modifications have been studied in yeast rRNA, where methylation of the residue homologous to human G1145 has been attributed to MRM1/PET56 (17.Sirum-Connolly K. Mason T. Functional requirement of a site-specific ribose methylation in ribosomal RNA.Science. 1993; 262: 1886-1889Google Scholar), and that analogous to U1369 methylation is conducted by MRM2 (18.Pintard L. Bujnicki J.M. Lapeyre B. Bonnerot C. MRM2 encodes a novel yeast mitochondrial 21S rRNA methyltransferase.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1139-1147Google Scholar). Yeast rRNA evidently lacks the G1370 methylation. Camara et al. (19.Cámara Y. Asin-Cayuela J. Park C.B. Metodiev M.D. Shi Y. Ruzzenente B. Kukat C. Habermann B. Wibom R. Hultenby K. Franz T. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hallberg B.M. Gustafsson C.M. Larsson N.-G. MTERF4 regulates translation by targeting the methyltransferase NSUN4 to the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 527-539Google Scholar) reported that deficiency of a complex of MTERF4 with the methyltransferase NSUN4 leads to ineffective assembly of the large ribosomal subunit. However, NSUN4 appears to be most closely related to m5C methyltransferases. Cytosine methylation has not been detected in 16 S rRNA, and the role for NSUN4 in the modification of backbone ribose residues is uncertain. Rorbach and Minczuk (8.Rorbach J. Minczuk M. The post-transcriptional life of mammalian mitochondrial RNA.Biochem. J. 2012; 444: 357-373Google Scholar) have suggested that this complex may affect a site in 12 S rRNA required for interaction between the large and small subunits. However, in this regard, it is interesting to note that a yeast homolog of KsgA, Dim1p, can stimulate cytoplasmic ribosome biogenesis even when its active site has been inactivated (20.Lafontaine D.L. Preiss T. Tollervey D. Yeast 18S rRNA dimethylase Dim1p. A quality control mechanism in ribosome synthesis?.Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 2360-2370Google Scholar), suggesting that simple binding of a methyltransferase can contribute to a checkpoint in ribosome assembly. With the possible exception of NSUN4, the mammalian enzymes responsible for these 16 S rRNA modifications have not been identified. We recently identified a candidate mitochondrial methyltransferase, RNMTL1, in association with mtDNA nucleoids (21.Bogenhagen D.F. Rousseau D. Burke S. The layered structure of human mitochondrial DNA nucleoids.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3665-3675Google Scholar). The RNMTL1 primary structure features a 2′-O-ribose binding site and a SpoU methyltransferase domain, whereas the amino terminus of the mouse protein has a predicted 99% probability of serving as a mitochondrial import signal (Mitoprot; available on the Helmholtz Center Munich Web site). Thus, we considered that this protein may be involved in 16 S rRNA modification. Examination of the GenBankTM database and other resources revealed two additional putative methyltransferases, MRM1 and MRM2, containing N-terminal sequences with a 99 and 57% probability of mitochondrial import, respectively. Mouse RNMTL1, MRM1, and MRM2 were all identified in a broad proteomic analysis of mitochondria from mouse tissues (22.Pagliarini D.J. Calvo S.E. Chang B. Sheth S.A. Vafai S.B. Ong S.-E. Walford G.A. Sugiana C. Boneh A. Chen W.K. Hill D.E. Vidal M. Evans J.G. Thorburn D.R. Carr S.A. Mootha V.K. A mitochondrial protein compendium elucidates complex I disease biology.Cell. 2008; 134: 112-123Google Scholar), but none of these proteins have been studied individually as mitochondrial proteins. One report on human MRM2 referred to this protein as FTSJ2, one of at least three human genes related to the bacterial FtsJ methyltransferase (RLME) that conducts 2′-O-methylation of uridyl residues (23.Ching Y.-P. Zhou H.-J. Yuan J.-G. Qiang B.-Q. Kung H.-f. Jin D.-Y. Identification and characterization of FTSJ2, a novel human nucleolar protein homologous to bacterial ribosomal RNA methyltransferase.Genomics. 2002; 79: 2-6Google Scholar). In that report, fusion of GFP on the N terminus of MRM2/FTSJ2 resulted in a nucleolar location. Because this expression strategy would obscure an N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal, we reinvestigated this using a conventional C-terminal fluorescent protein reporter to document that it is, indeed, a mitochondrial protein. In this paper, we report evidence that RNMTL1, MRM1, and MRM2 are all mtDNA nucleoid-associated mitochondrial proteins that probably participate in methylation of rRNA. We have focused on RNMTL1 in this report because it was this protein that we initially observed associated with nucleoids, and it has received no previous annotation as a mitochondrial protein. We found that this protein was associated with both nucleoids and ribosomes, establishing RNMTL1 as a subject for future detailed study of its role in ribosome assembly. We report that siRNA-directed depletion of RNMTL1 results in reduced efficiency of mitochondrial translation. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon. Chemicals used are listed with their suppliers: tissue culture media, mifepristone, and zeocin (Invitrogen); hygromycin B and Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science); 60% iodixanol (Optiprep, Sigma-Aldrich); DNase I Type II (Sigma-Aldrich); TurboNuclease (Accelagen); AmplifyTM (Amersham Biosciences). Other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs. Triton X-100 was obtained as a 10% solution from Fisher. [γ-32P]ATP and S-[3H]adenosylmethionine were obtained from MP Biochemicals. A mixture of [35S]methionine/cysteine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. His-Trap, heparin-Sepharose HiTrap, and Superose 6 chromatography columns were obtained from GE Healthcare. Antibodies directed against specific antigens are listed with their suppliers and dilutions: SDHA (MitoSciences; 1:10,000), anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:1,500), MRM1 (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:500), MRM2 (Abcam; 1:1000), MRPS15 (Proteintech; 1:1500), RNMTL1 (Proteintech; 1:5000), anti-DNA (Chemicon; 1:12,000), fluorescent goat-anti-rabbit or goat-anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes; 1:1000). Rabbit antibodies directed against human TFAM were generated in the Bogenhagen laboratory, and those directed against MRPL13 were a kind gift from Dr. Linda Spremulli (University of North Carolina; 1:1500 to 1:4000). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies used for colorimetric detection were from KPL. In some cases, HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (Thermo Scientific) were used at a 1:5000 dilution for detection using chemiluminescence imaged using a CCD camera system (Alpha Imager) or x-ray film. Mouse 3T3 cells transfected with pSwitch (HygR) to permit mifepristone induction were obtained from Invitrogen and are referred to as 3T3-Switch cells. These cells were transfected with a variety of pGS (ZeoR) vectors containing cDNAs fused to the Eos fluorescent reporter (24.Brown T.A. Fetter R.D. Tkachuk A.N. Clayton D.A. Approaches toward super-resolution fluorescence imaging of mitochondrial proteins using PALM.Methods. 2010; 51: 458-463Google Scholar) using Fugene 6, and stable cultures were obtained by selection on hygromycin B (50 μg/ml) and zeocin (200 μg/ml). For induction of genes encoded by the pGS vector, 50 pm mifepristone was applied for 16 h for biochemical isolation, or 100 pm mifepristone was added for 7 h for imaging. For fluorescent imaging of mitochondria, 50 nm MitoTracker Red was applied to live cells for at least 90 min prior to fixation. Suspension HeLa cells were cultured as described (21.Bogenhagen D.F. Rousseau D. Burke S. The layered structure of human mitochondrial DNA nucleoids.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3665-3675Google Scholar). Mouse RNMTL1, MRM1, and MRM2 were cloned from a first strand cDNA library (Clontech) with primers containing an AscI restriction site on the 5′-side and a NotI restriction site on the 3′-side and was inserted into pGS-Eos (24.Brown T.A. Fetter R.D. Tkachuk A.N. Clayton D.A. Approaches toward super-resolution fluorescence imaging of mitochondrial proteins using PALM.Methods. 2010; 51: 458-463Google Scholar), creating an in-frame fusion with the monomeric fluorescent protein Eos (25.McKinney S.A. Murphy C.S. Hazelwood K.L. Davidson M.W. Looger L.L. A bright and photostable photoconvertible fluorescent protein.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 131-133Google Scholar), generating pGS-mmRNMTL1-Eos, pGS-mmMRM1-Eos, and pGS-mmMRM2-Eos. The RNMTL1 insert was also transferred to pGS-FLAG3-His6 (pGS-3FH) vector constructed in the Bogenhagen lab containing the FLAG3 and His6 affinity tags in place of Eos. The predicted mature forms of human RNMTL1 and of mouse MRM1 and MRM2 lacking putative mitochondrial localization signals were cloned into the pET22b+ vector and expressed with a C-terminal His tag in Escherichia coli BL21 RIPL cells by induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1 m KCl to dissociate protein-nucleic acid interactions, and the supernatant was successively purified on HisTrapTM (GE Healthcare) and Heparin HiTrapTM (GE Healthcare) columns following standard procedures. Human MTERF4-NSUN4 protein was kindly provided by the laboratory of Miguel Garcia-Diaz (Stony Brook University). 3.5-cm diameter MatTek plates were coated with 15 μg/ml fibronectin for 2 h to improve cell adhesion and blocked with DMEM supplemented with FBS for 20 min, and 50,000–80,000 cells were plated. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde; permeabilized in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100; and blocked sequentially with MaxBlock (Active Motif) and 5% (v/v) horse serum, 3% (w/v) BSA, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Mouse anti-DNA antibodies were applied at a 1:12,000 dilution, rabbit anti-RNMTL1 antibodies were applied at 1:2000, and secondary antibodies were applied at 1:1000. All steps were conducted at 4 °C unless noted otherwise, and all buffers contained 0.2 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin A. Purification of mitochondria from larger quantities of HeLa cells grown in suspension culture was conducted essentially as described (21.Bogenhagen D.F. Rousseau D. Burke S. The layered structure of human mitochondrial DNA nucleoids.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3665-3675Google Scholar). For smaller scale preparations from 2.0 × 108 HeLa or 3T3 cells grown in monolayer culture, a modification of the digitonin lysis method (26.Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Assessment of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in patient muscle biopsies, lymphoblasts, and transmitochondrial cell lines.Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Google Scholar) was used. Cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min; washed with PBS and then with MIB (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.2 mg/ml BSA); and resuspended in 3 ml of MIB. 8 μl of 10% digitonin was added, cell permeabilization to trypan blue was confirmed microscopically, and then 7 ml of MIB was added to dilute the digitonin. Cells were pelleted at 1200 × g, resuspended in MIB, and passed through a 25-gauge needle until cells were completely homogenized, usually eight times. Cell lysis was confirmed by microscopic inspection. 5 ml of MIB was added to the lysate, and the nuclei were removed by three sequential centrifugation steps at 900 × g for 5 min each. Mitochondria were sedimented from the postnuclear supernatant by centrifugation in a Sorvall HB-6 swinging bucket rotor at 16,000 × g for 15 min. For some experiments, mitochondria purified to this stage were used for protein or RNA preparation. In other experiments, the mitochondria were resuspended in 3 ml of MIB containing 1 m KCl to dissociate nucleic acids and cytoplasmic proteins adherent to mitochondria (27.Kellems R.E. Allison V.F. Butow R.A. Cytoplasmic type 80S ribosomes associated with yeast mitochondria. IV. Attachment of ribosomes to the outer membrane of isolated mitochondria.J. Cell Biol. 1975; 65: 1-14Google Scholar) and repelleted. Mitochondria were treated with DNase I and TurboNuclease as described (21.Bogenhagen D.F. Rousseau D. Burke S. The layered structure of human mitochondrial DNA nucleoids.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3665-3675Google Scholar) and then repelleted, resuspended in MIB lacking BSA, and centrifuged to the interface of a 1 m/1.7 m sucrose step gradient in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. Gradients were centrifuged at 112,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C in 14 × 89-mm tubes in a swinging bucket rotor. Mitochondria were withdrawn from the interface and resuspended in three volumes of 0.5× MIB lacking BSA. The pure mitochondria were pelleted and frozen at −80 °C or directly lysed with Triton X-100 as reported below. Mitochondria were lysed with 2% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT with protease inhibitors as above. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and 700 μl of soluble supernatant was layered over a 10-ml 15–40% glycerol gradient containing gradient buffer (20 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 8, with 0.2% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors as above) with 2 mm EDTA formed over a pad containing 30% iodixanol, 20% glycerol in gradient buffer. The contents were centrifuged in 14 × 89-mm tubes at 210,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient. Glycerol gradient fraction 1, containing nucleoids, and pooled fractions containing the peak of SYBR Green II RNA staining representing mitochondrial ribosomes (typically fractions 7–11) were separately analyzed by equilibrium centrifugation through 20–40% iodixanol in gradient buffer with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2 mm EDTA at 140,000 × g overnight at 4 °C. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient. The ribosome-containing fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Vivaspin 50-kDa centrifugal concentrator prior to loading on iodixanol gradients. For higher resolution sedimentation analysis to separate 28 S and 39 S subunits from 55 S ribosomes, mitochondria were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm MgCl2. The soluble fraction of the mitochondrial lysate was separated by spinning at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and was then centrifuged through a 10-ml 10–30% sucrose gradient containing the same buffer as used to lyse the mitochondria, but with 0.02% Triton X-100 and either 20 mm MgCl2 or 2 mm EDTA, over a pad of 30% glycerol, 30% iodixanol, for 17 h at 70,000 × g at 4 °C. Smaller scale preparations were centrifuged in 11 × 60-mm tubes. Samples of 5–10 μl of gradient fractions were mixed with 100 μl of 100 mm NaCl/TE buffer containing 1:2000 diluted SYBR Green I or II dye (for DNA or RNA) (Invitrogen) in 96-well microtiter plates, and fluorescence was detected using a Typhoon FLA 9000 imager. Mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of FLAG column wash buffer provided by Sigma supplemented with Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Triton X-100). An equal volume of 2× lysis buffer consisting of 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 4% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors was added, and the suspension was mixed gently by pipetting. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. FLAG-tagged RNMTL1 in the soluble fraction was recovered on FLAG M resin (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, proteins were incubated with resin for 3 h at 4 °C while rotating, unbound proteins were removed by six successive washes with 200 μl of the provided wash buffer supplemented with 0.02% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors, and the bound proteins were eluted with three incubations with 200 μl of 150 μg/ml FLAG3 peptide diluted in wash buffer. All of the handling was performed in a batch-wise format in a 0.6-ml microcentrifuge tube. The supernatants were separated from the resin by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C in a swinging bucket rotor. A 20-μl sample of the eluate was boiled in standard Laemmli sample loading buffer for 5 min and briefly electrophoresed into a polyacrylamide gel. The gel was submitted to the Proteomics Center at Stony Brook University. Tryptic fragments were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Thermo Fisher Scientific LTQ Orbitrap XL ETD mass spectrometer by matching collision-induced dissociation spectra against a library of known peptide spectra derived from the Swiss-Prot/Trembl database. Raw data were analyzed by the Inspect and Sequest programs and collated with Scaffold. HeLa cells were transfected with 3 or 6 nm silencer siRNA oligonucleotides directed against human RNMTL1 or with a scrambled negative control oligonucleotide using RNAiMax reverse transfection, as suggested by the supplier (Invitrogen), and RNA was isolated from total cells or from a partially purified mitochondrial fraction using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Alternatively, protein was isolated from partially purified mitochondria as described below. In some experiments, RNA was treated with DNase I and used to generate cDNA for real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) analysis using kits obtained from Ambion (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed with SYBR Green I quantification using a Step One Plus instrument (Applied Biosystems) using primers derived from mtDNA sequences for 16 S rRNA (5′-CCAAACCCACTCCACCTTAC and 5′-TCATCTTTCCCTTGCGGTAC) and 12 S rRNA (5′-TAGATACCCCACTATGCTTAGC and 5′-CGATTACAGAACAGGCTCC) and mRNAs for ND1 (5′-TCAAACTCAAACTACGCCCTG and 5′-GTTGTGATAAGGGTGGAGAGG), ND2 (5′-CTACTCCACCTCAATCACACTAC and 5′-AGGTAGGAGTAGCGTGGTAAG), ND5 (5′-GTCCATCATAGAATTCTCAC and 5′-GCCCTCTCAGCCGATGAAC), ND6 (5′-CCACAACCACCACCCCATC and 5′-GGTTGAGGTCTTGGTGAGT), and COXI (5′-ACACGAGCATATTTCACCTC and 5′-CCTAGGGCTCAGAGCACTGC). RT-PCR was also used under similar conditions to detect 12 S and/or 16 S rRNA in glycerol gradient fractions. 35S labeling of mitochondrial proteins was performed essentially as described (28.Chomyn A. In vivo labeling and analysis of human mitochondrial translation products.Methods in Enzymology. 1996; 264: 197-211Google Scholar). HeLa cells transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides directed against RNMTL1 or a negative control scrambled sequence were cultured for 3 days. Cells were rinsed for 5 min with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then for 5 min with DMEM lacking cysteine and methionine and then for 5 min with the same depleted medium supplemented with dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml emetine. After this pretreatment, 8 μl (∼80 μCi) of [35S]cysteine/methionine was added to 4 ml of medium for 1 h of labeling. This medium was then changed to complete DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum for a 30-min chase in the continued presence of emetine. Partially purified mitochondria were prepared as described above. Incorporation was analyzed by TCA precipitation and scintillation counting or by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were dried, and incorporation was quantified using a Typhoon 9000 imager (GE Healthcare). Cells transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides or with negative control scrambled oligomers were used to prepare crude mitochondrial fractions. RNA was prepared from partially purified mitochondria using TRIzol. To provide a control unmodified RNA sequence, T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion T7 Megascript) was used to transcribe a recombinant version of human 16 S rDNA obtained from Edison Mejia and Miguel Garcia-Diaz (Stony Brook University). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized with sequences having 3′-termini 4 or 5 nucleotides away from known 2′-O-ribose modification sites in domain 5 (5′-GGTTGGGTTCTGCTCCGAGG) or domain 6 (5′-GATCACGTAGGACTTTAATCG) of human 16 S rRNA. Primers were labeled at 5′-termini using [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase and were purified by electrophoresis on urea-14% polyacrylamide gels. Labeled primers were annealed to 500 ng of crude mtRNA or T7 transcript in first strand buffer for Superscript 3 reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The annealed mixture was supplemented with Superscript 3 reverse transcriptase, RNasin RNase inhibitor, and dithiothreitol and then aliquoted to reactions containing varied concentrations of all four dNTPs for 30 min of extension at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.3 m sodium acetate, 20 mm EDTA, and 10 μg of glycogen carrier. Nucleic acids were ethanol-precipitated, boiled in formamide loading solution containing 10 mm EDTA, and analyzed by electrophoresis on urea-14% polyacryla"
https://openalex.org/W2051253171,"Patients with hemophilia lacking functional coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) are treated with replacement FVIII proteins. The development of neutralizing antibodies to the replacement FVIII, a major clinical problem, depends on the nature of the mutation in the gene encoding FVIII. The authors find that a prevalent inversion allele can unexpectedly produce FVIII protein, explaining why individuals with this allele do not frequently develop neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to replacement factor VIII (FVIII, either plasma derived or recombinant) impair the effective management of hemophilia A1. Individuals with hemophilia A due to major deletions of the FVIII gene (F8) lack antigenically cross-reactive material in their plasma (“CRM-negative”), and the prevalence of inhibitors in these individuals may be as high as 90%. Conversely, individuals with hemophilia A caused by F8 missense mutations are CRM-positive, and their overall prevalence of inhibitors is <10% (ref. 2). Individuals with the F8 intron 22 inversion (found in ∼50% of individuals with severe hemophilia A) have been grouped with the former on the basis of their genetic defect and CRM-negative status. However, only ∼20% of these individuals develop inhibitors3. Here we demonstrate that the levels of F8 mRNA and intracellular FVIII protein in B lymphoblastoid cells and liver biopsies from individuals with the intron 22 inversion are comparable to those in healthy controls. These results support the hypothesis that most individuals with the intron 22 inversion are tolerized to FVIII and thus do not develop inhibitors. Furthermore, we developed a new pharmacogenetic algorithm that permits the stratification of inhibitor risk for individuals and subpopulations by predicting the immunogenicity of replacement FVIII using, as input, the number of putative T cell epitopes in the infused protein and the competence of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules to present such epitopes. This algorithm showed statistically significant accuracy in predicting the presence of inhibitors in 25 unrelated individuals with the intron 22 inversion."
https://openalex.org/W2059533280,"Formation of appropriate synaptic connections is critical for proper functioning of the brain. After initial synaptic differentiation, active synapses are stabilized by neural activity-dependent signals to establish functional synaptic connections. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying activity-dependent synapse maturation remain to be elucidated. Here we show that activity-dependent ectodomain shedding of signal regulatory protein-α (SIRPα) mediates presynaptic maturation. Two target-derived molecules, fibroblast growth factor 22 and SIRPα, sequentially organize the glutamatergic presynaptic terminals during the initial synaptic differentiation and synapse maturation stages, respectively, in the mouse hippocampus. SIRPα drives presynaptic maturation in an activity-dependent fashion. Remarkably, neural activity cleaves the extracellular domain of SIRPα, and the shed ectodomain in turn promotes the maturation of the presynaptic terminal. This process involves calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, matrix metalloproteinases and the presynaptic receptor CD47. Finally, SIRPα-dependent synapse maturation has an impact on synaptic function and plasticity. Thus, ectodomain shedding of SIRPα is an activity-dependent trans-synaptic mechanism for the maturation of functional synapses."

Screening over 6,000 genes identified over 1,500 candidates, evenly divided between channel inhibitors and activators. Genes in the phosphatidylinositol pathway were enriched on the primary candidate list, and these, along with other ENaC activators, were examined further with secondary siRNA validation. Subsequent detailed investigation revealed ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) as an ENaC modulator and showed that inhibition of (diacylglycerol kinase, iota) DGKι, a protein involved in PiP2 metabolism, downgrades ENaC activity, leading to normalization of both Na+ and fluid absorption in CF airways to non-CF levels in primary human lung cells from CF patients.

ENaC, the epithelial sodium (Na+) channel is a major player in salt and water reabsorption and epithelial surface hydration in a number of tissues, including airways and alveolar sacs, ducts of exocrine glands, renal collecting duct, and distal colon. ENaC plays a prominent role in lung liquid clearance by the alveolar epithelium after birth by reabsorbing fetal lung fluid (O’Brodovich, 1991O’Brodovich H. Epithelial ion transport in the fetal and perinatal lung.Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C555-C564PubMed Google Scholar). As a member of the degenerin ion channel family, ENaC consists of three main subunits, α-, β- and γ-ENaC (Canessa et al., 1994Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel is made of three homologous subunits.Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). ENaC impairment leads to diverse diseases with the hallmark of local or systemic imbalance in Na+ and water homeostasis. ENaC loss-of-function results for example in renal salt wasting (type I pseudohypoaldosteronism) or pulmonary edema (Berthiaume and Matthay, 2007Berthiaume Y. Matthay M.A. Alveolar edema fluid clearance and acute lung injury.Respir. Physiol. Neurobiol. 2007; 159: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, ENaC gain-of-function leads to several forms of salt-sensitive hypertension (e.g., Liddle syndrome) or cystic fibrosis (CF) (Bonny and Hummler, 2000Bonny O. Hummler E. Dysfunction of epithelial sodium transport: from human to mouse.Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Lifton et al., 2001Lifton R.P. Gharavi A.G. Geller D.S.

Sodium channels and cystic fibrosis.Chest. 2007; 132: 1631-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). CF is a life-threatening disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a chloride (Cl−) channel localized in the apical membrane of epithelial cells (Riordan, 2008Riordan J.R. CFTR function and prospects for therapy.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 701-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Physiologically, CFTR inhibits ENaC and thus regulates pulmonary Na+ absorption (Kunzelmann et al., 1995Kunzelmann K. Kathöfer S. Greger R. Na+ and Cl- conductances in airway epithelial cells: increased Na+ conductance in cystic fibrosis.Pflugers Arch. 1995; 431: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Gentzsch et al., 2010Gentzsch M.

Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32227-32232Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In CF, however, the absence of active CFTR leads to Na+ hyperabsorption, which causes dehydration of airway surface liquid (ASL), a hallmark of CF (Boucher, 2007Boucher R.C. Cystic fibrosis: a disease of vulnerability to airway surface dehydration.Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 231-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, Mall et al., 1998Mall M. Bleich M. Greger R. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. The amiloride-inhibitable Na+ conductance is reduced by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in normal but not in cystic fibrosis airways.J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence for the major role that ENaC plays in CF airways came from ßENaC-overexpressing mice, which mimic various aspects of human CF respiratory disease (Mall et al., 2004Mall M. Grubb B.R. Harkema J.R. O’Neal W.K. Boucher R.C. Increased airway epithelial Na+ absorption produces cystic fibrosis-like lung disease in mice.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). This is in striking contrast to CFTR knockout or CFTR mutant mice, which do not develop lung disease (Snouwaert et al., 1992Snouwaert J.N. Brigman K.K. Latour A.M. Malouf N.N. Boucher R.C. Smithies O. Koller B.H. An animal model for cystic fibrosis made by gene targeting.Science. 1992; 257: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Membrane levels of ENaC are mostly regulated by endocytosis and proteolysis mediated by the E3-ubiquitin-ligase Nedd4-2. Another mouse model, a lung-specific Nedd4-2 knockout, was shown to also develop a CF-like condition (Kimura et al., 2011Kimura T. Kawabe H. Jiang C. Zhang W. Xiang Y.Y. Lu C. Salter M.W. Brose N. Lu W.Y. Rotin D. Deletion of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4L in lung epithelia causes cystic fibrosis-like disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 3216-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), further establishing the key role of ENaC in CF airway disease. So, along with the search for small molecules to restore CFTR activity, ENaC inhibitors have been sought for CF therapeutics to reduce ENaC-mediated Na+ hyperabsorption and increase ASL hydration (Amaral and Kunzelmann, 2007Amaral M.D. Kunzelmann K. Molecular targeting of CFTR as a therapeutic approach to cystic fibrosis.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 334-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Such a goal might also be of interest to treat chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), disseminated bronchiectasis, or even CFTR dysfunction caused by cigarette smoking (Clunes et al., 2012Clunes L.A. Davies C.M. Coakley R.D. Aleksandrov A.A. Henderson A.G. Zeman K.L. Worthington E.N. Gentzsch M. Kreda S.M. Cholon D. et al.Cigarette smoke exposure induces CFTR internalization and insolubility, leading to airway surface liquid dehydration.FASEB J. 2012; 26: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). ENaC blockers may also serve to hydrate mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract, mouth, nose, and eye and treat ENaC gain-of-function conditions, like ENaC-related hypertension (Butterworth et al., 2009Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Frizzell R.A. Johnson J.P. Regulation of the epithelial sodium channel by membrane trafficking.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 296: F10-F24Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Amiloride (Amil), used for the management of hypertension and congestive heart failure, was the first ENaC pharmacological inhibitor tested in CF, but studies showed no significant improvement due to its short half-life in the lungs (Knowles et al., 1990Knowles M.R. Church N.L. Waltner W.E. Yankaskas J.R. Gilligan P. King M. Edwards L.J. Helms R.W. Boucher R.C. A pilot study of aerosolized amiloride for the treatment of lung disease in cystic fibrosis.N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Longer-acting and more potent ENaC inhibitors (IC50 ∼10 nM) include Amil derivatives such as benzamil or PS552 (Parion Sciences, Durham, NC), both yielding disappointing results in CF trials (Donaldson and Boucher, 2007Donaldson S.H. Boucher R.C. Sodium channels and cystic fibrosis.Chest. 2007; 132: 1631-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, Hirsh et al., 2006Hirsh A.J. Molino B.F. Zhang J. Astakhova N. Geiss W.B. Sargent B.J. Swenson B.D. Usyatinsky A. Wyle M.J. Boucher R.C. et al.Design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships of novel 2-substituted pyrazinoylguanidine epithelial sodium channel blockers: drugs for cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis.J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 4098-4115Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Excessive blocking of ENaC may cause severe harm, via undesirable accumulation of fluid in the lungs, i.e., pulmonary edema (Althaus et al., 2011Althaus M. Clauss W.G. Fronius M. Amiloride-sensitive sodium channels and pulmonary edema.Pulm. Med. 2011; 2011: 830320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Instead, we need compounds normalizing ASL homeostasis through physiological regulation of ENaC. If achieved independently of CFTR, such normalization could correct ion transport in CF patients with any CFTR mutation. Despite detailed knowledge on how several ENaC regulators control both channel number at the cell surface and its open probability (Butterworth et al., 2009Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Frizzell R.A. Johnson J.P. Regulation of the epithelial sodium channel by membrane trafficking.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 296: F10-F24Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), many aspects of ENaC biogenesis, trafficking, and regulation remain obscure. Herein, we have undertaken a large-scale loss-of-function (siRNA) screen for ENaC with the ultimate goal of identifying putative druggable targets. We used a live-cell assay and automatic microscopy to functionally assess ENaC in human respiratory epithelial cells after reverse siRNA transfection (Erfle et al., 2007Erfle H. Neumann B. Liebel U. Rogers P. Held M. Walter T. Ellenberg J. Pepperkok R. Reverse transfection on cell arrays for high content screening microscopy.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) with libraries targeting a total of 6,396 genes. We thus identified 1,626 genes regulating ENaC: 887 inhibitors and 739 activators. Bioinformatic analyses of primary hits identified the phosphatidylinositol (PI) pathway as the top enriched pathway (with 30 hits), 37% of which were validated. The top ∼60% primary ENaC-hits also underwent reassessment, achieving ∼30% validation. The validated hits were then classified into known ENaC regulatory pathways. Seven genes were found to lie outside such pathways and 2 of these were chosen for further investigation and shown to be key ENaC regulators: diacylglycerol kinase iota (DGKι), a potential robust CF therapeutic target; and ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR), an original ENaC modulator, which proved the screen’s power to identify novel hits. For the high-content siRNA screen, we used a live-cell assay measuring ENaC activity through the voltage-sensitive fluorescent FMP dye in combination with specific ENaC blocker Amil (Almaça et al., 2011Almaça J. Dahimène S. Appel N. Conrad C. Kunzelmann K. Pepperkok R. Amaral M.D. Functional genomics assays to study CFTR traffic and ENaC function.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 742: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Human alveolar epithelial cells A549 (with endogenous ENaC expression) were grown under dexamethasone (Dexa) to maximize ENaC expression (Figures 1A and 1B ) (Itani et al., 2002Itani O.A. Auerbach S.D. Husted R.F. Volk K.A. Ageloff S. Knepper M.A. Stokes J.B. Thomas C.P. Glucocorticoid-stimulated lung epithelial Na(+) transport is associated with regulated ENaC and sgk1 expression.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2002; 282: L631-L641PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting α-ENaC subunit or ßCOP (component of traffic vesicles) as positive controls and scrambled siRNA (Scrbld) as negative control. As expected both α-ENaC and ßCOP siRNAs (but not Scrbld) significantly suppressed the quenching of Amil-induced fluorescence (Figures 1C and 1D). The difference between the values for positive (si-αENaC/ si-ßCOP) and Scrbld or “slide score” (see Supplemental Information) is relatively modest (∼10%). However, due to high reproducibility and lack of overlap between positive and negative controls (Figure 1D) we could proceed to high-content microscopy screening. Indeed, the robustness of the microscopy approach and image analysis, allowing collection of cell-based multi-information data (number of cells, removal of debris, apoptotic cells, etc.), enabled quality control, which, together with “local background” correction and robust statistics (Chung et al., 2008Chung N. Zhang X.D. Kreamer A. Locco L. Kuan P.F. Bartz S. Linsley P.S. Ferrer M. Strulovici B. Median absolute deviation to improve hit selection for genome-scale RNAi screens.J. Biomol. Screen. 2008; 13: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) led to reliable and reproducible hit discrimination. For the automated high-throughput microscopy screen, we individually silenced 6,396 protein-coding human genes, using 2-3 siRNAs per gene (n = 17,622) and monitored their effects on ENaC activity by the FMP/Amil assay. The result for each siRNA consisted in the “slide-normalized spot score” (“SNS-score”) averaged from siRNA replicates (Dataset S1A available online). SNS-scores were put into an ordered distribution (Figure 2A) and siRNAs with SNS-scores ≤ −2 were considered as inhibiting ENaC (Dataset S1B), whereas those with SNS-scores ≥ 2 were considered as activating ENaC (Dataset S1C, Figure 2A). In summary (Figure 2C), this primary screen revealed 1,626 hits: 739 genes activating ENaC, i. e., targeted by siRNAs inhibiting ENaC (highlighted in yellow in Figure 2C): 711 with one, 27 with two and 1 with 3 siRNAs plus 887 genes inhibiting ENaC, i.e., targeted by ENaC-activating siRNAs: 832 with one, 52 with two and 3 with three siRNAs. All 1,626 ENaC regulator hits were analyzed by DAVID bioinformatic tool for functional annotation, which revealed the phosphatidylinositol (PI) pathway (KEGG hsa04070) as the most significantly enriched with 30 genes, p < 2x10−6 (Dataset S2 and Figure S1). After validation by stringent selection criteria 11 (37%) of these 30 genes could be established as “truly confirmed” hits with two or more siRNAs (Dataset S3A and Figure S1): 10 ENaC activators (CDS1, DGKA, DGKI, ITPK1, ITPR3, PIK3CB, PIK3CD, PIP4K2A, PLCB1, PLCZ1) and 1 ENaC inhibitor (PIK3C2B). Although other genes among the 30 had at least two siRNAs that confirmed the primary screen, they also had another siRNA with opposite effect and thus they were not considered as hits.Figure S1Screen Hits in the Phosphatidylinositol Signaling System, Related to Figure 2Show full captionGraphic representation of the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway (KEGG pathway map 04070), which appeared as the most enriched in primary screen hits. siRNAs targeting 30 crucial enzymes of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) pathway and of several PI-derived phosphoinositides were scored as hits in the primary screen (∗) and validated with ≥ 2 siRNAs (∗∗), where green asterisks (∗) indicate ENaC-inhibiting and red asterisks (∗)ENaC-activating genes; a pink asterisk (∗) indicates opposite results with different siRNAs in the primary screen).

Diacylglycerol kinase iota (DGKI), later selected for further investigation as an ENaC modulator is also included in this pathway. As we aimed to identify ENaC activators (to be inhibited by small molecules), we also sought for additional siRNA validation of the top 60% ENaC-activating genes (456 out of 739 activator genes). The normalized results of this validation screen are displayed as a scatter plot in Figure 2B and siRNAs below the −1 threshold were considered as hits (gray area, Figure 2B). This is the minimum normalized score for “empty spots” (i.e., positions with lipofectamine only, no siRNA). We thus confirmed 132 (∼30%) out of the rescreened 456 primary screen hits (Figure 2C). These, together with hits targeted by at least two siRNAs in the primary screen, identified 160 ENaC-activator genes (Figure 2C, Dataset S3B). As most of these hits encode proteins never reported as ENaC regulators, we used Gene Ontology (GO) terms to classify them (Figure S2). We also checked their role in previous screens using the same siRNAs or in other relevant studies (Dataset S3B). Interestingly, the largest group (33%) had been previously implicated in secretory trafficking (Simpson et al., 2012Simpson J.C. Joggerst B. Laketa V. Verissimo F. Cetin C. Erfle H. Bexiga M.G. Singan V.R. Hériché J.K. Neumann B. et al.Genome-wide RNAi screening identifies human proteins with a regulatory function in the early secretory pathway.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 764-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), followed by 23% in cell division (Neumann et al., 2010Neumann B. Walter T. Hériché J.K. Bulkescher J. Erfle H. Conrad C. Rogers P. Poser I. Held M. Liebel U. et al.Phenotypic profiling of the human genome by time-lapse microscopy reveals cell division genes.Nature. 2010; 464: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), 5% in plasma membrane targeting of Src kinases (Ritzerfeld et al., 2011Ritzerfeld J. Remmele S. Wang T. Temmerman K. Brügger B. Wegehingel S. Tournaviti S. Strating J.R. Wieland F.T. Neumann B. et al.Phenotypic profiling of the human genome reveals gene products involved in plasma membrane targeting of SRC kinases.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 1955-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and 3% in a global set of CFTR interactors (Wang et al., 2006Wang X. Venable J. LaPointe P. Hutt D.M. Koulov A.V. Coppinger J. Gurkan C. Kellner W. Matteson J.

Notably, in the latter group we found CFTR itself (plus APC, RYK, HSP90B1, COPB1). To gain mechanistic insight into how the validated hits regulate ENaC, we performed the same FMP/Amil assay for these genes under conditions that interfere with pathways known to affect ENaC, namely: (1) incubation of cells with protease inhibitor aprotinin to inhibit ENaC activation by proteolytic cleavage (Gaillard et al., 2010Gaillard E.A. Kota P. Gentzsch M. Dokholyan N.V. Stutts M.J. Tarran R. Regulation of the epithelial Na+ channel and airway surface liquid volume by serine proteases.Pflugers Arch. 2010; 460: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) by; (2) under Nedd4-2 siRNA transfection to inhibit ENaC endocytosis mediated by the Nedd4-2/SGK1 pathway (Staub et al., 1997Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D.

Kathöfer S. Greger R.

Biol. 2011; 742: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Data in Figure 3A (left graph) show first that aprotinin-treated cells exhibit a modest but consistent and significant decrease (∼20%) in the Amil-sensitive ratio versus control cells, as expected due to inhibition of ENaC activation by serine endopeptidases. Second, data show (Figure 3A, left) that removal of Dexa (6h) already causes significant ENaC inhibition, which, however, can be reverted by Nedd4-2 siRNA with a significant ∼15% increase versus control cells. Third, induction of WT-CFTR expression (but not of F508del-CFTR) by doxycycline and butyrate (Dox/but), causes a significant decrease in ENaC function of ∼50% (Figure 3A, right graph). By recapitulating the in vivo regulation of ENaC by CFTR (Kunzelmann et al., 1995Kunzelmann K. Kathöfer S. Greger R. Na+ and Cl- conductances in airway epithelial cells: increased Na+ conductance in cystic fibrosis.Pflugers Arch. 1995; 431: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), these cells are thus very useful to test how the novel ENaC regulators relate to CFTR. Next, by rescreening the validated ENaC activators under these 3 conditions we classified them according to such pathways (heat-maps in Figure 3B). For example, under Nedd4-2 downregulation, ∼56% of the siRNA hits no longer inhibited ENaC (“Nedd4-2-sensitive” hits) suggesting that they exert their effects on this pathway and indicating the central role that this E3-ubiquitin ligase plays on ENaC regulation. Also, in the presence of aprotinin, ∼32% of the siRNA hits no longer inhibited ENaC, suggesting that their effects on ENaC are protease-mediated. Based on their sensitivity to these treatments, the validated hits were grouped into 5 different classes (Figure 3B and Dataset S4): (1) class I (∼23%) insensitive to all treatments; (2) class II (∼18%) sensitive to all three treatments; (3) class III, (4) class IV, (5) class V, hits sensitive only to aprotinin (∼3%), 6h-Dexa (∼13%) or Nedd4-2-siRNA (∼23%), respectively. Additional sets (classes VI, VII and VIII) include hits that are sensitive to two out of the three treatments (Dataset S4). Classification of hits according to their CFTR-dependence produced additional classes (marked “∗,”Dataset S4). For example, class IV∗ includes hits no longer affecting ENaC upon WT-CFTR expression. Of particularly interest are hits showing differential effects in the presence of WT- versus F508del-CFTR (classes IV∗ and V∗) as they may be key to elucidate how WT-CFTR (but not F508del-CFTR) prevents ENaC-mediated Na+ hyperabsorption in non-CF individuals. Seven hits were insensitive to all treatments (classes “I and I∗”) namely: ACY3; CCNI; CNTFR; DGKι; IQCF1; MEST; SERPINB3. As they fall out of known ENaC regulatory pathways they deserve further investigation. To select for putative drug targets and learn more about the validated genes, additional bioinformatic analyses were performed, including a measure of their “closeness to ENaC,” given by “cosine similarity” values (see Supplemental Information). This was based on the proteases-Nedd4-2 scores (Dataset S4B) and used as reference values for si-αENaC: the higher the cosine similarity the closer genes are to ENaC (Dataset S5 and Figure S3). We also submitted the above 7 “insensitive” hits to predictive protein-protein functional correlations (FunL, see Supplemental Information) in relation to ENaC. From the resulting network (Figure S4) two genes emerged functionally closer to ENaC: CNTFR and DGKι. We next selected both genes for further studies.Figure S4Prediction of Functional Protein-Protein Correlations between ENaC and the Seven Genes Ranking as “Insensitive to All Treatments,” Related to Figure 3Show full captionSeven genes found as “insensitive to all treatments” in the classification screen (see in Dataset S4, common to classes I and I∗) were submitted to predictive analysis of protein-protein functional correlations (FunL) in relation to ENaC, using “FunL” bioinformatics tool (see Experimental Procedures). The resulting network graph evidenced two genes (in red), CNTFR (ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor) and DGKι (diacylglycerol kinase, iota) as functionally closer to ENaC (α subunit), i.e., both three steps apart. These two genes were considered as the most interesting to be pursued.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Seven genes found as “insensitive to all treatments” in the classification screen (see in Dataset S4, common to classes I and I∗) were submitted to predictive analysis of protein-protein functional correlations (FunL) in relation to ENaC, using “FunL” bioinformatics tool (see Experimental Procedures).

These two genes were considered as the most interesting to be pursued. Although DGK was a recognized ENaC regulator (Kunzelmann et al., 2005Kunzelmann K. Bachhuber T. Regeer R. Markovich D. Sun J. Schreiber R. Purinergic inhibition of the epithelial Na+ transport via hydrolysis of PIP2.FASEB J. 2005; 19: 142-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), its DGKι isoform was mechanistically evaluated here as a possible drug target for CF. Indeed, four main reasons led to selection of DGKι: first, DGKι emerged as a key hit in the top-enriched pathway—the PI signaling system (Figure S1 and Dataset S2); second, the DGKι isoform was found to be highly expressed in human airways (Figure S5); third, bioinformatic analysis (Figure S3) ranked DGKι very close to ENaC (nr.11) even higher than CFTR (nr.14); finally, as a kinase, it is amenable to small-molecule inhibition and thus a good drug target. CNTFR in turn, was also further investigated as an original hit due to its bioinformatic proximity to ENaC (Figures S3 and S4) and to demonstrate the screen’s power to identify original hits. DGKι was thus investigated as a drug target candidate for ENaC regulation and results in various cell types showed that it is essential for maintenance of ENaC activity. First, we showed that a chemical blocker of DGK (DGKinh, 25 μM) led to ∼50% ENaC inhibition in A549 cells (Figures 4A and 4B ). Second, in mouse tracheas assessed ex vivo in Ussing chambers, DGKinh attenuated Amil-induced voltage deflection and inhibited Amil-sensitive short-circuit current, indicating inhibition of ENaC by ∼60% (Figures 4C and 4D). Third, these data were confirmed in polarized H441 human airway epithelial cells and M1 mouse collecting duct cells (data not shown), as well as after coexpression of three ENaC subunits (αβγ) in Xenopus oocytes, where the Amil-inhibited whole-cell conductance (GAmil) was ∼30% inhibited by DGKinh (Figure 4E, left bar). To better understand the underlying mechanisms, we assessed ENaC conductance in Xenopus oocytes, by coexpressing DGKι and WT- or truncated (αH648X) αENaC with WT-βγENaC. We found that ∼60% of GAmil produced by αH648XβγENaC was inhibited by DGKinh, in contrast to only ∼30% for αβγENaC (Figure 4E). The truncated αH648X lacks an essential binding site for the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, resulting in enhanced ENaC-activity (GAmil = 107.27 ± 26.4 versus 47.25 ± 4.8 μS) that is fully subjected to regulation by PIP2 and DGKinh (Yue et al., 2002Yue G.

IDUA consists of a TIM barrel domain containing the catalytic site, a β-sandwich domain and a fibronectin-like domain. Structures of IDUA bound to iduronate analogs illustrate the Michaelis complex and reveal a (2,5)B conformation in the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, which suggest a retaining double displacement reaction involving the nucleophilic Glu299 and the general acid/base Glu182. Unexpectedly, the N-glycan attached to Asn372 interacts with iduronate analogs in the active site and is required for enzymatic activity.

To track this dynamic allocation in monkey prefrontal cortex, we used time-resolved measures of neural population activity in a simple case of competition between target (behaviorally critical) and nontarget objects in opposite visual hemifields. Early in processing, there were parallel responses to competing inputs, with neurons in each hemisphere dominated by the contralateral stimulus. Later, the nontarget lost control of neural activity, with emerging global control by the behaviorally critical target. The speed of transition reflected the competitive weights of different display elements, occurring most rapidly when relative behavioral significance was well established by training history. In line with adaptive coding, the results show widespread reallocation of prefrontal processing resources as an attentional focus is established."
https://openalex.org/W2078213703,"Phytochromes are widely distributed photoreceptors with a bilin chromophore that undergo a typical reversible photoconversion between the two spectrally different forms, Pr and Pfr. The phytochrome Agp2 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens belongs to the group of bathy phytochromes that have a Pfr ground state as a result of the Pr to Pfr dark conversion. Agp2 has untypical spectral properties in the Pr form reminiscent of a deprotonated chromophore as confirmed by resonance Raman spectroscopy. UV/visible absorption spectroscopy showed that the pKa is >11 in the Pfr form and ∼7.6 in the Pr form. Unlike other phytochromes, photoconversion thus results in a pKa shift of more than 3 units. The Pr/Pfr ratio after saturating irradiation with monochromatic light is strongly pH-dependent. This is partially due to a back-reaction of the deprotonated Pr chromophore at pH 9 after photoexcitation as found by flash photolysis. The chromophore protonation and dark conversion were affected by domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis. A replacement of the PAS or GAF domain by the respective domain of the prototypical phytochrome Agp1 resulted in a protonated Pr chromophore; the GAF domain replacement afforded an inversion of the dark conversion. A reversion was also obtained with the triple mutant N12S/Q190L/H248Q, whereas each single point mutant is characterized by decelerated Pr to Pfr dark conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2070332280,"Cysteine cathepsins are endolysosomal cysteine proteases highly expressed in macrophages; however, their individual contributions to the elimination of bacteria and bacteria-induced cytokine production by macrophages are unknown. We assessed the contribution of cysteine cathepsins to macrophage defense pathways against Staphylococcus aureus by using chemical inhibitors and by infecting primary bone marrow-derived macrophages deficient in 1 of 7 major macrophage-expressed endolysosomal cysteine proteases. We show that cysteine cathepsins are involved in the phagocytosis and killing of S. aureus. Cathepsin L was identified as an executor of nonoxidative killing. Moreover, microarray data revealed cysteine cathepsins to be important for the maximal induction of certain proinflammatory genes, such as IL6, in response to S. aureus. Cysteine cathepsin's contribution to IL6 production was dependent on phagocytosis, and cathepsin K was identified to be a critical protease in this process. Analysis of macrophages with impaired trafficking of endolysosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to the acidic compartment revealed that they were not involved in cathepsin-dependent IL6 induction. Because IL6 production was completely dependent on the TLR-adaptor protein myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), it appears that other TLRs are involved. In summary, lysosomal cysteine proteases are functionally linked to the complex bactericidal and inflammatory activities of macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2048714646,"The adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin facilitates synaptic transmission presynaptically via cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). In addition, cAMP also increases glutamate release via PKA-independent mechanisms, although the downstream presynaptic targets remain largely unknown. Here, we describe the isolation of a PKA-independent component of glutamate release in cerebrocortical nerve terminals after blocking Na(+) channels with tetrodotoxin. We found that 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP, a specific activator of the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac), mimicked and occluded forskolin-induced potentiation of glutamate release. This Epac-mediated increase in glutamate release was dependent on phospholipase C, and it increased the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Moreover, the potentiation of glutamate release by Epac was independent of protein kinase C, although it was attenuated by the diacylglycerol-binding site antagonist calphostin C. Epac activation translocated the active zone protein Munc13-1 from soluble to particulate fractions; it increased the association between Rab3A and RIM1α and redistributed synaptic vesicles closer to the presynaptic membrane. Furthermore, these responses were mimicked by the β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) agonist isoproterenol, consistent with the immunoelectron microscopy and immunocytochemical data demonstrating presynaptic expression of βARs in a subset of glutamatergic synapses in the cerebral cortex. Based on these findings, we conclude that βARs couple to a cAMP/Epac/PLC/Munc13/Rab3/RIM-dependent pathway to enhance glutamate release at cerebrocortical nerve terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2078752919,"Cl(-)/H(+) antiporters of the CLC superfamily transport anions across biological membranes in varied physiological contexts. These proteins are weakly selective among anions commonly studied, including Cl(-), Br(-), I(-), NO3(-) and SCN(-), but they seem to be very selective against F(-). The recent discovery of a new CLC clade of F(-)/H(+) antiporters, which are highly selective for F(-) over Cl(-), led us to investigate the mechanism of Cl(-)-over-F(-) selectivity by a CLC Cl(-)/H(+) antiporter, CLC-ec1. By subjecting purified CLC-ec1 to anion transport measurements, electrophysiological recording, equilibrium ligand-binding studies and X-ray crystallography, we show that F(-) binds in the Cl(-) transport pathway with affinity similar to Cl(-) but stalls the transport cycle. Examination of various mutant antiporters implies a 'lock-down' mechanism of F(-) inhibition, in which F(-), by virtue of its unique hydrogen-bonding chemistry, greatly retards a proton-linked conformational change essential for the transport cycle of CLC-ec1."
https://openalex.org/W1986345626,"Cell-matrix interactions are critical for tumor cell migration. Lutheran (Lu), also known as basal cell adhesion molecule (B-CAM), competes with integrins for binding to laminin α5, a subunit of LM-511, a major component of basement membranes. Here we show that the preferential binding of Lu/B-CAM to laminin α5 promotes tumor cell migration. The attachment of Lu/B-CAM transfectants to LM-511 was slightly weaker than that of control cells, and this was because Lu/B-CAM disturbed integrin binding to laminin α5. Lu/B-CAM induced a spindle cell shape with pseudopods and promoted cell migration on LM-511. In addition, blocking with an anti-Lu/B-CAM antibody led to a flat cell shape and inhibited migration on LM-511, similar to the effects of an activating integrin β1 antibody. We conclude that tumor cell migration on LM-511 requires that Lu/B-CAM competitively modulates cell attachment through integrins. We suggest that this competitive interaction is involved in a balance between static and migratory cell behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2104982296,"Mammalian primary visual cortex (V1) is topographically organized such that the pattern of neural activation in V1 reflects the location and spatial extent of visual elements in the retinal image, but it is unclear whether this organization contributes to visual perception. We combined computational modeling, voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) in behaving monkeys and behavioral measurements in humans to investigate whether the large-scale topography of V1 population responses influences shape judgments. Specifically, we used a computational model to design visual stimuli that had the same physical shape, but were predicted to elicit variable V1 response spread. We confirmed these predictions with VSDI. Finally, we designed a behavioral task in which human observers judged the shapes of these stimuli and found that their judgments were systematically distorted by the spread of V1 activity. This illusion suggests that the topographic pattern of neural population responses in visual cortex contributes to visual perception."

https://openalex.org/W2018723389,"Vitamin A, retinol, circulates in blood bound to retinol-binding protein (RBP). At some tissues, holo-RBP is recognized by a plasma membrane receptor termed STRA6, which serves a dual role: it mediates transport of retinol from RBP into cells, and it functions as a cytokine receptor that, on binding holo-RBP, activates JAK2/STAT5 signaling. As STAT target genes include SOCS3, an inhibitor of insulin receptor, holo-RBP suppresses insulin responses in STRA6-expressing cells. We have shown previously that the two functions of STRA6 are interdependent. These observations suggest factors that regulate STRA6-mediated retinol transport may also control STRA6-mediated cell signaling. One such factor is retinol metabolism, which enables cellular uptake of retinol by maintaining an inward-directed concentration gradient. We show here that lecithin:retinol acyl transferase (LRAT), which catalyzes esterification of retinol to its storage species retinyl esters, is necessary for activation of the STRA6/JAK2/STAT5 cascade by holo-RBP. In accordance, LRAT-null mice are protected from holo-RBP-induced suppression of insulin responses. Hence, STRA6 signaling, which requires STRA6-mediated retinol transport, is supported by LRAT-catalyzed retinol metabolism. The observations demonstrate that STRA6 regulates key cellular processes by coupling circulating holo-RBP levels and intracellular retinol metabolism to cell signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2066131038,"Bovine lactoferricin (LfcinB), a multifunctional peptide, was recently demonstrated to be anti-catabolic and anti-inflammatory in human articular cartilage. LfcinB blocks IL-1-mediated proteoglycan depletion, matrix-degrading enzyme expression, and pro-inflammatory mediator induction. LfcinB selectively activates ERK1/2, p38 (but not JNK), and Akt signaling. However, the relationship between these pathways and LfcinB target genes has never been explored. In this study, we uncovered the remarkable ability of LfcinB in the induction of an anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-11. LfcinB binds to cell surface heparan sulfate to initiate ERK1/2 signaling and activate AP-1 complexes composed of c-Fos and JunD, which transactivate the IL-11 gene. The induced IL-11 functions as an anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective cytokine in articular chondrocytes. Our data show that IL-11 directly attenuates IL-1-mediated catabolic and inflammatory processes ex vivo and in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W1963847956,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP), encoded on Hsa21, functions as a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) in axonal growth cones (GCs) of the developing brain. We show here that axonal GCs of human fetal Down syndrome (DS) neurons (and of a DS mouse model) overexpress APP protein relative to euploid controls. We investigated whether DS neurons generate an abnormal, APP-dependent GC phenotype in vitro. On laminin, which binds APP and β1 integrins (Itgb1), DS neurons formed enlarged and faster-advancing GCs compared to controls. On peptide matrices that bind APP only, but not on those binding exclusively Itgb1 or L1CAM, DS GCs were significantly enlarged (2.0-fold), formed increased close adhesions (1.8-fold), and advanced faster (1.4-fold). In assays involving alternating stripes of monospecific matrices, human control GCs exhibited no preference for any of the substrates, whereas DS GCs preferred the APP-binding matrix (cross-over decreased significantly from 48.2 to 27.2%). Reducing APP expression in DS GCs with siRNA normalized most measures of the phenotype, including substrate choice. These experiments show that human DS neurons exhibit an APP-dependent, abnormal GC phenotype characterized by increased adhesion and altered contact guidance. The results suggest that APP overexpression may perturb axonal pathfinding and circuit formation in developing DS brain."
https://openalex.org/W1965991277,"We previously demonstrated that the mTORC1/S6K1 pathway is activated by insulin and nutrient overload (e.g. amino acids (AA)), which leads to the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway via the inhibitory serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, notably on serine 1101 (Ser-1101). However, even in the absence of AA, insulin can still promote IRS-1 Ser-1101 phosphorylation by other kinases that remain to be fully characterized. Here, we describe a new negative regulator of IRS-1, the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). Computational analyses revealed that Ser-1101 within IRS-1 falls into the consensus motif of RSK. Moreover, recombinant RSK phosphorylated IRS-1 C-terminal fragment on Ser-1101, which was prevented by mutations of this site or when a kinase-inactive mutant of RSK was used. Using antibodies directed toward the phosphorylation sites located in the activation segment of RSK (Ser-221 or Ser-380), we found that insulin activates RSK in L6 myocytes in the absence of AA overload. Inhibition of RSK using either the pharmacological inhibitor BI-D1870 or after adenoviral expression of a dominant negative RSK1 mutant (RSK1-DN) showed that RSK selectively phosphorylates IRS-1 on Ser-1101. Accordingly, expression of the RSK1-DN mutant in L6 myocytes and FAO hepatic cells improved insulin action on glucose uptake and glucose production, respectively. Furthermore, RSK1 inhibition prevented insulin resistance in L6 myocytes chronically exposed to high glucose and high insulin. These results show that RSK is a novel regulator of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism and a potential mediator of insulin resistance, notably through the negative phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser-1101."

https://openalex.org/W2147025823,"Entry of enveloped viruses into host cells is mediated by their surface envelope glycoproteins (Env). On the surface of the virus, Env is in a metastable, prefusion state, primed to catalyze the fusion of the viral and host membranes. An external trigger is needed to promote the drastic conformational changes necessary for the fusion subunit to fold into the low-energy, 6-helix bundle. These triggers typically facilitate pH-independent entry at the plasma membrane or pH-dependent entry in a low-pH endosomal compartment. The α-retrovirus avian sarcoma leukosis virus (ASLV) has a rare, 2-step entry mechanism with both pH-dependent and pH-independent features. Here, we present the 2.0-Å-resolution crystal structure of the ASLV transmembrane (TM) fusion protein. Our structural and biophysical studies indicated that unlike other pH-dependent or pH-independent viral TMs, the ASLV fusion subunit is stable irrespective of pH. Two histidine residues (His490 and His492) in the chain reversal region confer stability at low pH. A structural comparison of class I viral fusion proteins suggests that the presence of a positive charge, either a histidine or arginine amino acid, stabilizes a helical dipole moment and is a signature of fusion proteins active at low pH. The structure now reveals key residues and features that explain its 2-step mechanism, and we discuss the implications of the ASLV TM structure in the context of general mechanisms required for membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2089809378,"Mutations in matrix Gla protein (MGP) have been correlated with vascular calcification. In the mouse model, MGP null vascular disease presents as calcifying cartilaginous lesions and mineral deposition along elastin lamellae (elastocalcinosis). Here we examined the mechanisms underlying both of these manifestations. Genetic ablation of enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in Mgp(-/-) mice dramatically reduced the size of cartilaginous lesions in the aortic media, attenuated calcium accrual more than 2-fold, and doubled longevity as compared with control Mgp(-/-) animals. Nonetheless, the Mgp(-/-);Tgm2(-/-) mice still died prematurely as compared with wild-type and retained the elastocalcinosis phenotype. This pathology in Mgp(-/-) animals was developmentally preceded by extensive fragmentation of elastic lamellae and associated with elevated serine elastase activity in aortic tissue and vascular smooth muscle cells. Systematic gene expression analysis followed by an immunoprecipitation study identified adipsin as the major elastase that is induced in the Mgp(-/-) vascular smooth muscle even in the TG2 null background. These results reveal a central role for TG2 in chondrogenic transformation of vascular smooth muscle and implicate adipsin in elastin fragmentation and ensuing elastocalcinosis. The importance of elastin calcification in MGP null vascular disease is highlighted by significant residual vascular calcification and mortality in Mgp(-/-);Tgm2(-/-) mice with reduced cartilaginous lesions. Our studies identify two potential therapeutic targets in vascular calcification associated with MGP dysfunction and emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to this multifaceted disorder."
