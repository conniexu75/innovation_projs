https://openalex.org/W2080480553,"Both long-term and short-term sensitization of the gill and siphon withdrawal reflex in Aplysia involve facilitation of the monosynaptic connections between the sensory and motor neurons. To analyze the relationship between these two forms of synaptic facilitation at the cellular and molecular level, this monosynaptic sensorimotor component of the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia can be reconstituted in dissociated cell culture. Whereas one brief application of 1 Î¼M serotonin produced short-term facilitation in the sensorimotor connection that lasted minutes, five applications over 1.5 hours resulted in long-term facilitation that lasted more than 24 hours. Inhibitors of protein synthesis or RNA synthesis selectively blocked long-term facilitation, but not short-term facilitation, indicating that long-term facilitation requires the expression of gene products not essential for short-term facilitation. Moreover, the inhibitors only blocked long-term facilitation when given during the serotonin applications; the inhibitors did not block the facilitation when given either before or after serotonin application. These results parallel those for behavioral performance in vertebrates and indicate that the critical time window characteristic of the requirement for macromolecular synthesis in long-term heterosynaptic facilitation is not a property of complex circuitry, but an intrinsic characteristic of specific nerve cells and synaptic connections involved in the long-term storage of information."
https://openalex.org/W2030923676,"We demonstrate that cell-free extracts prepared from activated eggs of X. laevis by a method similar to that of Lohka and Masui initiate and complete semiconservative DNA replication of sperm nuclei and plasmid DNA. The efficiency of replication is comparable to that in the intact egg. Under optimal conditions 70%-100% of nuclei, and up to 38% of naked DNA molecules replicate completely. Genuine initiation of replication occurs rather than elongation of preformed primers or priming of irreversibly denatured templates. Rereplication of templates is observed under certain conditions. In addition to replicating DNA, these extracts also assemble nucleus-like structures from naked DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2008139645,"We determined the effect on splicing of 24 point mutations in the 5' and 3' splice region of the large rabbit beta-globin intron. In vitro, 3' AG mutations drastically reduce 5' cleavage and abolish splicing. In vivo, the same mutations elicit efficient splicing at a cryptic, rather than the correct, 3' splice site. In vitro, mutations at all but 2 positions of the consensus 5' splice region impair correct splicing and promote joining of exon 1 to exon 3. In vivo, the same mutations show no effect, except for those converting 5' GT to AT or GA, which cause accumulation of lariat intermediate in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that the 5' GT need not be conserved for 5' cleavage and that it plays an important role in cleavage and exon joining at the 3' splice site."
https://openalex.org/W2043469236,"We present evidence that addition of the 35 nucleotide spliced leader (SL) to the 5' end of T. brucei mRNAs occurs via trans RNA splicing. A 100 nucleotide fragment of the 135 base SL RNA (100-mer) is revealed by S1 nuclease analysis of total and poly(A)+ RNA. This 100-mer is not detected by Northern hybridization analysis, indicating that it does not exist free in the cell. The 5' end of the 100-mer maps precisely to the conserved splice junction sequence of the SL RNA. Purified debranching enzyme releases this 100-mer RNA as a free, 100 nucleotide species. This indicates that the 100-mer is covalently linked to poly(A)+ RNA by a 2'-5' phosphodiester bond, that the branched intermediate has a discontinuous intron or Y structure (rather than a lariat), which is expected of a trans-spliced mRNA, and that the SL RNA is indeed the donor of the SL sequence to trypanosome mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2021724833,"Optimal distribution of blood flow requires coordination of vasodilation among resistance vessels. During hyperemia, blood vessels dilate upstream from the initiating stimulus. Spreading vasodilation independent of flow changes has not been previously demonstrated. In the present study, iontophoresis of acetylcholine adjacent to single hamster cheek pouch arterioles in situ (diameter, 20 to 37 micrometers) induced a rapid bidirectional dilation that was not attenuated when blood flow was eliminated with vascular occlusion. This finding indicates that a vasodilatory stimulus is conducted along the arteriole and demonstrates the existence of a mechanism of intercellular communication that is capable of coordinating diameter changes among resistance vessels."
https://openalex.org/W2041929512,"Recent discoveries about the molecular organization and physical properties of the mammalian erythrocyte membrane and its associated structural proteins can now be used to explain, and may eventually be used to predict, the shape of the erythrocyte. Such explanations are possible because the relatively few structural proteins of the erythrocyte are regularly distributed over the entire cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane and because the well-understood topological associations of these proteins seem to be stable in comparison with the time required for the cell to change shape. These simplifications make the erythrocyte the first nonmuscle cell for which it will be possible to extend our knowledge of molecular interactions to the next hierarchical level of organization that deals with shape and shape transformations."
https://openalex.org/W2023691876,"The concentrations of enzyme sites in cells are usually higher than the concentrations of cognate intermediary metabolites. Therefore metabolic pathways or substantial segments of pathways may proceed by the direct transfer of metabolites from one enzyme site to the next by means of enzyme-enzyme complex formation. This mechanism of metabolite transfer differs from that usually assumed where dissociation and random diffusion of metabolite through the aqueous environment is responsible for the transfer to the next enzyme site. Since the direct transfer mechanism does not involve the aqueous environment, the energetics of metabolite interconversion can differ from expectations based on aqueous solution data. Evidence is summarized suggesting that metabolite is transformed and transferred with equal facility everywhere in the direct transfer pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1514571277,"Oligosaccharides (10-20 monosaccharide units) with high affinity for antithrombin, as well as larger high-affinity heparin fractions (having relative molecular masses between 6,000 and 21,500), all markedly accelerated the inhibition of Factor Xa by antithrombin. Moreover, all high-affinity oligosaccharides and heparins enhanced, to a similar extent, the amount of free proteolytically modified antithrombin cleaved at the reactive bond by Factor Xa. In contrast, a minimum high-affinity heparin size of approximately 18 monosaccharide units was required to significantly accelerate the inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin and to enhance the production of modified antithrombin by this enzyme. All high-affinity fractions studied had similar affinities for antithrombin, as determined by fluorescence titrations. In competition experiments, binary complexes of antithrombin with octadecasaccharide or larger high-affinity heparins, but not with smaller oligosaccharides, displaced inactivated 125I-thrombin from matrix-linked low-affinity heparin. Moreover, similar binary complexes with 3H-labeled octadecasaccharide or larger chains, but not with smaller oligosaccharides, were capable of binding to matrix-linked inactivated thrombin. These results indicate that simultaneous binding of antithrombin and thrombin to high-affinity heparin is a prerequisite to the acceleration of the antithrombin-thrombin reaction and that the minimum heparin sequence capable of binding both proteins comprises approximately 18 monosaccharide units. Similar complex formation apparently is not required for the acceleration of the antithrombin-Factor Xa reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2015868758,"Apparently large exposures of the general public to the radioactive decay products of radon-222 present in indoor air have led to systematical appraisal of monitoring data from U.S. single-family homes; several ways of aggregating data were used that take into account differences in sample selection and season of measurements. The resulting distribution of annual-average radon-222 concentrations can be characterized by an arithmetic mean of 1.5 picocurie per liter (55 becquerels per cubic meter) and a long tail with 1 to 3% of homes exceeding 8 picocuries per liter, or by a geometric mean of 0.9 picocurie per liter and a geometric standard deviation of about 2.8. The standard deviation in the means is 15%, estimated from the number and variability of the available data sets, but the total uncertainty is larger because these data may not be representative. Available dose-response data suggest that an average of 1.5 picocuries per liter contributes about 0.3% lifetime risk of lung cancer and that, in the million homes with the highest concentrations, where annual exposures approximate or exceed those received by underground uranium miners, long-term occupants suffer an added lifetime risk of at least 2%, reaching extraordinary values at the highest concentrations observed."
https://openalex.org/W2031878824,"Mouse ribosomal genes have a short sequence upstream of the transcription initiation site that is related in structure and function to the terminator boxes previously identified at the 3' end of the transcription unit. This upstream terminator recognizes the same protein factor as the 3'-terminal sites and is able to terminate RNA polymerase I transcription in vitro. S1 mapping and nucleolar run-on experiments reveal the presence of 5'-terminal spacer transcripts that are terminated at this site. These transcripts probably derive from spacer promoters, one of which has been identified approximately 2 kb upstream of the pre-rRNA start site. The interaction of a specific nuclear factor with the upstream terminator increases the efficiency of initiation, suggesting that transcription termination and initiation at the adjacent promoter work in an interrelated fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2026722001,"On the Xenopus laevis ribosomal genes, RNA polymerase traverses the entire repeating unit of gene plus spacer and terminates just upstream of the next gene promoter. A conserved 7 bp element located at about â200 is an essential part of this terminator. In this paper we show that, in addition to its termination function, this same sequence motif acts as an upstream element of the adjacent promoter and appears to contribute to the long-term stability of the transcription complex."
https://openalex.org/W1977339299,"The primary sex-determining signal in the nematode C. elegans is the ratio of X chromosomes to sets of autosomes (X/A ratio). As a consequence, males (XO; ratio 0.5) and hermaphrodites (XX; ratio 1.0) possess different doses of X-linked genes. Here we demonstrate that C. elegans compensates for this disparity in gene dose by equalizing the levels of X-specific mRNA transcripts in the two sexes. Moreover, we show that mutations in three autosomal genes disrupt the process of dosage compensation. Reduction in the activity of either dpy-21, dpy-27, or dpy-28 results in the overexpression of X-specific genes, 2- to 3-fold above wild-type levels."
https://openalex.org/W1493415606,"Cysteine conjugate beta-lyase has been purified from rat kidney cytosol. The enzyme is a 100,000-dalton dimer of two 55,000-dalton subunits and has an absorption maximum at 432 nm. The enzyme has phenylalanine alpha-keto-gamma-methiolbutyrate transaminase activity and appears to be identical to rat kidney cytosolic glutamine transaminase K. Metabolism of S-1,2-dichlorovinyl-L-cysteine (DCVC) by the purified enzyme was dependent on the presence of either alpha-keto-gamma-methiolbutyrate or a protein factor which is present in the cytosolic fraction of rat kidney cortex. The protein factor was identified as a flavin containing L-amino acid oxidase which oxidized DCVC to S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-3-mercapto-2-oxopropionic acid. S-(1,2-Dichlorovinyl)-3-mercapto-2-oxopropionic acid has not been previously reported as a metabolite of DCVC. The data also show that rat kidney cytosolic glutamine transaminase K catalyzes both a beta-elimination and a transamination reaction with DCVC when alpha-keto-gamma-methiolbutyrate is present and that amino acid oxidase and alpha-keto-gamma-methiolbutyrate stimulate the enzyme activity by providing amino acceptors. When incubations were done with DCVC as substrate in the presence of excess alpha-keto-gamma-methiolbutyrate, the beta-lyase catalyzed beta-elimination and transamination in a ratio of 1:1.3, respectively. Under conditions where most of the alpha-keto-gamma-methiolbutyrate was consumed, the beta-elimination predominated indicating that the S-1,2-dichlorovinyl-3-mercapto-2-oxopropionic acid pool was consumed by transamination after the alpha-keto-gamma-methiolbutyrate had been depleted. The data are discussed with regard to the importance of these pathways as regulators or participants in the toxicity of S-cysteine conjugates."
https://openalex.org/W1534548156,"A novel membrane-bound glycan-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, which catalyzes the conversion of membrane form variant surface glycoproteins to soluble variant surface glycoproteins, with the release of sn-1,2-dimyristylglycerol, has been isolated from Trypanosoma brucei. The activity was solubilized from trypanosome membrane fractions in non-ionic detergent and purified by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose followed by chromatography on phosphatidylinositol-Sepharose. The enzyme constitutes about 0.1% of the total cellular protein and has an apparent molecular weight of 39,800. The enzyme shows a head group specificity for molecules containing carbohydrate covalently linked to glycan-phosphatidylinositol, but can also act on the monoacyl derivative of membrane form variant surface glycoprotein. It shows no specific ion requirements but is stimulated by thiol-reducing agents and inhibited by ions that thiols chelate."
https://openalex.org/W1967054888,"Sequences flanking residue-168 of the mouse rRNA gene are essential to direct efficient transcription in transfected cells and are stimulatory in vitro on closed circular templates. This promoter domain evidently functions by the unprecedented mechanism of terminating polymerase I-directed transcripts. It inhibits transcripts from reading into the initiation region, acting cotranscriptionally to end these RNAs at residue--182 and release them from the template. Most likely, polymerases on tandem genomic rRNA genes are not released upon completing each 40-47S transcript, but traverse the entire spacer to the next promoter-terminator, where they are made available and positioned to favor reinitiation. Through such polymerase recycling, plus the binding of free polymerase, the rDNA promoters could achieve their characteristically high level of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1527115904,"Diacylglycerol has gained wide acceptance as an important second messenger in the signal transduction mechanism by which occupancy of certain membrane receptors such as the formyl peptide receptor of neutrophils leads to biological responses, but supporting evidence for this proposed role is limited. We have utilized a recently developed diacylglycerol kinase assay (Preiss, J. E., Loomis, C. R., Bishop, W. R., Stein, R., Niedel, J. E., and Bell, R. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 8597-8600) to characterize the diacylglycerol response of normal human neutrophils stimulated with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and other formyl peptides. fMLP alone stimulated a slow, prolonged 36% rise in diacylglycerol levels above basal levels. Cytochalasin B enhances several fMLP-stimulated neutrophil responses, including aggregation, superoxide production, and degranulation. Pretreatment of neutrophils with cytochalasin B markedly increased the rate and extent of the diacylglycerol response to fMLP stimulation. Diacylglycerol peaked at 5 min at 206 +/- 21% above basal levels with a t1/2 of 45 s. The diacylglycerol response was time- and fMLP and cytochalasin B concentration-dependent, appropriate for the known biological activities of several peptide analogues, and completely inhibited by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. These data demonstrate that diacylglycerol may function as a second messenger for neutrophil activation and suggest that cytochalasin B enhancement of neutrophil biology may be the result of an enhanced diacylglycerol response."
https://openalex.org/W1560897882,"We isolated 59 Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants defective in 35SO4 incorporation into glycosaminoglycans. Thirty-five mutants incorporated [6-3H]glucosamine into glycosaminoglycans normally, suggesting that they were specifically impaired in sulfate incorporation. Cell hybridization studies revealed that the 35 mutants defined a unique complementation group. Pulse-labeling one of the mutants with 35SO4 showed that it possessed a defect in a saturable, 4-acetamido-4-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive transport system required for sulfate uptake. Despite the dramatic reduction in 35SO4 incorporation, the mutant synthesized sulfated heparan and chondroitin chains. Incubation of the mutant with [35S]cysteine resulted in the formation of 35SO4, which was subsequently incorporated into the glycosaminoglycans. Similar results were obtained when wild-type cells were incubated in sulfate-free growth medium containing [35S]cysteine, and isotope dilution analysis indicated that about 15 microM of sulfate was derived from cysteine catabolism. We also found that the sulfate transport deficiency rendered the mutant resistant to 5 microM sodium chromate, whereas wild-type cells did not divide under these conditions. However, the mutant also did not proliferate in medium containing 5 microM chromate when grown in the presence of wild-type cells, suggesting that chromate was transported through cell-cell contacts. Since co-cultivating sulfate transport-deficient mutants with mutants defective in xylosyltransferase or galactosyltransferase I partially restored 35SO4 incorporation into glycosaminoglycans, intercellular sulfate transport occurred as well. Therefore, the availability of sulfate for glycosaminoglycan synthesis depends on sulfate uptake, turnover of sulfur-containing amino acids, and sulfate transport between cells."
https://openalex.org/W2078983017,"The la antigen-associated invariant chain (ln) exists in humans as two major related forms, p33 and p35. The mRNA for ln contains two in-phase AUGs, at positions 8 and 56 from the cap site. Cells transfected with a full-length cDNA clone in an expression vector synthesize both p33 and p35. Cell-free translation of mRNA synthesized in vitro from cDNA also produces both forms. When the first ATG is deleted from the cDNA clone, only the smallest form of ln is produced. Mutations introduced at the second ATG lead to synthesis of the large form only. The alternative use of two in-phase AUGs on a unique mRNA is thus responsible for the synthesis of p33 and p35. This is the first documented example of such a mechanism in nonviral systems."
https://openalex.org/W1976649676,"A nonrepetitive complementary RNA probe specific for an intervening sequence of the rat pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene primary transcript was used to analyze the hormonal regulation of POMC gene transcription in individual cell nuclei in the rat pituitary by in situ hybridization. This probe recognized only full-length POMC heterogeneous nuclear RNA, as verified by Northern blots of pituitary RNA. When pituitary sections were hybridized with this 3H-labeled POMC intron A probe, silver grains were predominantly localized over the nuclei of cells that expressed POMC in the anterior and intermediate lobes. Adrenalectomy increased both the average grain density over corticotroph nuclei and the number of cells in the anterior pituitary with significant numbers of silver grains over their nucleus. Dexamethasone administration to intact or adrenalectomized rats results in the rapid (within 30 minutes) disappearance of silver grains over the nuclei of corticotrophs in the anterior lobe, suggesting that POMC gene transcription had been inhibited. However, adrenalectomy or dexamethasone administration did not alter the silver grain density over nuclei of intermediate lobe melanotrophs. Thus, this in situ hybridization assay utilizing an intervening sequence-specific POMC probe can measure rapid physiological changes in POMC heterogeneous nuclear RNA in individual cell nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W2053129976,"Clonal cell lines derived from specific types of central neurons can be used to identify and characterize properties specific to those neurons. With somatic cell fusion techniques, nine clonal hybrid cell lines have been developed from the septal region of the mouse basal forebrain. Two lines express characteristics typical of cholinergic neurons--choline acetyltransferase activity and immunoreactivity, neurite formation with neurofilament protein immunoreactivity, and aggregation in rotation-mediated cell culture. These cell lines may be useful for studying the trophic interactions that support the development and maintenance of central cholinergic connections."
https://openalex.org/W1583351160,"The changes in protein phosphorylation associated with bovine tracheal smooth muscle contraction were studied by labeling intact muscle strips with [32P]PO4(3-) and analyzing the phosphoproteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Among 20 to 30 phosphoproteins resolvable with the two-dimensional electrophoresis system, the phosphorylation of 12 proteins was reproducibly affected by treatment with carbachol, in a time-dependent manner. Five of these proteins have been identified as 20-kDa myosin light chain, caldesmon, synemin, and two isoelectric variants of desmin. The other 7 are low molecular weight (Mr less than 40,000) cytosolic proteins. One cytosolic protein and myosin light chain are quickly but transiently phosphorylated by carbachol, the peak of myosin light chain phosphorylation being at about 1 min after agonist addition. In contrast, both variants of desmin, synemin, caldesmon, and 5 cytosolic proteins are phosphorylated at varying rates and remain phosphorylated for the duration of carbachol action. These late phosphorylation changes occur simultaneously with the dephosphorylation of one cytosolic protein. These carbachol-induced phosphorylation changes, like the contractile response, appear to be calcium-dependent. The addition of 12-deoxyphorbol 13-isobutyrate, a protein kinase C activator, causes a dose-dependent, sustained contraction of tracheal smooth muscle which develops more slowly than that induced by carbachol. This contractile response is associated with the same protein phosphorylation changes as those observed after prolonged carbachol treatment. In contrast, forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator and a potent smooth muscle relaxant, induces the phosphorylation protein 3 and one variant of desmin. These observations strongly suggest that different phosphoproteins may be mediators of tension development and tension maintenance in agonist-induced contraction of tracheal smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2082889121,"The three-dimensional structure of favin, the glucose- and mannose-binding lectin of Vicia faba (vetch, broad bean), has been determined at a resolution of 2.8 angstroms by molecular replacement. The crystals contain specifically bound glucose and provide the first high-resolution view of specific saccharide binding in a leguminous lectin. The structure is similar to those of concanavalin A (Con A) and green pea lectin; differences from Con A show that minimal changes are needed to accommodate the cyclic permutation in amino acid sequence between the two molecules. The molecule is an ellipsoidal dimer dominated by extensive beta structures. Each protomer contains binding sites for two divalent metal ions (Mn2+ and Ca2+) and a specific saccharide. Glucose is bound by favin in a cleft in the molecular surface and has noncovalent contacts primarily with two peptide loops, one of which contains several metal ion ligands. The specific carbohydrate-binding site is similar to that of Con A in location and general peptide folding, despite several differences in specific amino acid residues."

https://openalex.org/W1508994608,"The effects of growth hormone on the expression of sex-dependent testosterone 16 alpha- and 15 alpha-hydroxylases were studied in growth hormone-deficient Little (lit/lit) mice at the activity as well as at the mRNA levels. The male isozyme of testosterone 16 alpha-hydroxylase (C-P-450(16)alpha) was repressed in the liver of male lit/lit mice, and the injection of bovine growth hormone resulted in an increase of the isozyme at both activity and mRNA levels to those seen in control lit/+ male mice. On the other hand, the female isozymes of testosterone 16 alpha- (I-P-450(16)alpha) and 15 alpha-hydroxylase (P-450(15)alpha) were increased in livers of both male and female lit/lit mice. The increased I-P-450(16)alpha and P-450(15)alpha in lit/lit mice were suppressed by growth hormone but only when it was injected once every 12 h. Thus, the results indicate that growth hormone acts as a masculinizing factor for testosterone hydroxylase activity by activating and inhibiting the expression of male and female isozymes of testosterone hydroxylases in mice, respectively. When growth hormone was infused to simulate a continuous secretion pattern, it showed no significant effect on the expression of hydroxylases in lit/lit mice, suggesting that growth hormone may not be a feminizing factor for testosterone hydroxylase activity in female mice. The changes of specific hydroxylase activities modulated by growth hormone in the mice correlated well with those amounts of hydroxylase mRNAs. The action of exogenous growth hormone to regulate the hydroxylases was so slow that it took 2 days to show a significant effect."
https://openalex.org/W1990292675,"We have isolated a complete Xenopus borealis cardiac actin gene, which is normally expressed in the myotomes and heart of the embryo and tadpole. After injection into the zygote, this cloned gene becomes distributed throughout the embryo, but it is expressed almost wholly in the myotomes. The same wide distribution of injected DNA but spatially restricted pattern of expression is found with a fusion between the first two actin gene exons and the last exon of a mouse beta-globin gene. By contrast, a histone-globin fusion gene is expressed fairly uniformly in all regions. We discuss the special advantages of using Xenopus in studies of tissue-specific gene expression from injected, cloned genes in early development."
https://openalex.org/W1992425415,"The term ""nuclear rotation"" refers to a motion of nucleoli within interphase nuclei of several cell types. No mechanism or function has been ascribed to this phenomenon, and it was unknown whether nuclear structures in addition to nucleoli participate in this motion. Moreover, it was unclear whether nuclear rotation occurs independent of concurrent motion of juxtanuclear cytoplasm. The work reported here presents quantitative evidence, for three-dimensional intranuclear, tandem motion of fluorescently labeled chromatin domains associated with nucleoli and those remote from nucleoli. The results show that such motion is curvilinear, that it is not restricted to nucleoli, and, moreover, that it occurs independently of motion of juxtanuclear, cytoplasmic structures. These results suggest that this motion represents karyoplasmic streaming and its function is to transpose to nuclear pores those chromatin domains actively transcribed."
https://openalex.org/W1542955842,"We have isolated and analyzed the structure of the gene for thymidylate synthase from a 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-resistant 3T6 cell line that overproduces thymidylate synthase 50-fold by virtue of gene amplification. Three overlapping DNA segments containing the entire thymidylate synthase gene were identified in Charon 35 genomic libraries. Sequence analysis revealed that all of the coding regions were contained in a 12-kilobase segment of DNA. The gene has 6 introns ranging from 0.6 to 4.1 kilobases in length. The sequences at the 5' and 3' ends of each intron conformed to the consensus sequences for mammalian introns. S1 nuclease and primer extension assays showed that transcription of the thymidylate synthase gene initiates at several sites within a 66-nucleotide region. There are no TATAA or CCAAT sequences in the vicinity of the initiation sites. However, the region does contain DNA sequences that are known to stimulate binding of the transcription factors Sp1 and USF. These binding sites are adjacent to each other, suggesting that the two proteins may bind to the upstream region of the thymidylate synthase gene in a cooperative or competitive manner."
https://openalex.org/W1493129807,"Tyrosine sulfate was identified as a constituent of human heparin cofactor II by analysis of sulfate-labeled protein secreted by a human hepatoma-derived cell line and of purified protein from human plasma. Alkaline hydrolysis of heparin cofactor II released tyrosine sulfate as demonstrated by anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography of hydrolysates. Two sites of sulfation were identified, and the amino acid sequences of the sites were established by sequential Edman degradation of sulfate-containing tryptic peptides that were isolated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Each peptide contains only a single tyrosine residue so that the sites of sulfation can be assigned unambiguously. The two sites of sulfation are separated by 13 residues and represent an internal sequence repeat in the heparin cofactor II molecule. The two sites have the following sequences. Glu56-Asp-Asp-Asp-Tyr(SO4)-Leu-Asp62 Glu69-Asp-Asp-Asp-Tyr(SO4)-Ile-Asp75 Sulfate-labeled heparin cofactor II formed a covalent complex with thrombin in a heparin-dependent manner. Thus, the sulfate-containing form of the protein was shown to be biologically active. The characteristic sulfate-containing segment of heparin cofactor II, which contains 17 acidic amino acid residues over a span of 30 residues, may contribute to the unique properties of this thrombin inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1482372406,"Changes in the concentration of cytosolic free calcium were recorded microfluorometrically in rat vascular smooth muscle cells in primary culture and loaded with quin-2. The effects of caffeine and high extracellular K+ on the release of calcium from the intracellular storage sites were determined. In the absence of extracellular calcium, both the depolarization of plasma membrane with excess extracellular K+ and the application of caffeine induced a transient and dose-dependent elevation of the cytosolic free calcium concentration, with durations of 4 and 2 min, respectively. Transient elevations of calcium repeatedly appeared in response to both repetitive depolarization (100 mM K+) and caffeine (10 mM) applications with progressive reductions in peak levels. In either case, the fifth or later treatments induced little or no rise in levels of the cytosolic calcium. The amount of released calcium induced by high K+ depolarization after (n-1) time applications (1 less than or equal to n less than or equal to 5) of caffeine was equal to that induced by the n-th application of caffeine. The amount of released calcium induced by caffeine after (n-1) time exposures (1 less than or equal to n less than or equal to 5) to K+ depolarization was equal to that observed during the n-th exposure to K+ depolarization. These results indicate that caffeine- and depolarization-sensitive intracellular calcium storage sites may be identical and that caffeine and K+, in optimal concentrations, will release an equal amount of calcium from the same storage site in cultured arterial smooth muscle cells, irrespective of the amount of stored calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1552806667,"A novel post-translationally modified residue, gamma-N-methylasparagine, was detected in the beta subunit of Anabaena variabilis allophycocyanin. Structure determination was accomplished by isolating a decapeptide, AP-beta (63-72) shown to have the following structure: Ser-Asp-Ile-Thr-Arg-Pro-Gly-Gly- Asn[N-CH3]-homoserine lactone Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry established that the residue corresponding to position 71 in the protein (DeLange, R. J., Williams, L. C., and Glazer, A. N. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 9558-9566) contained 13 mass units more than expected for aspartic acid though aspartic acid was recovered after acid hydrolysis. The 1H NMR spectrum of AP-beta (63-72) revealed a strong methyl single at 2.71 ppm characteristic of the methyl derivative of an amide nitrogen. Confirmation of this bond arrangement was obtained by detection of a stoichiometric amount of methylamine in acid hydrolysates of the peptide. This is the first report of gamma-N-methylasparagine in a protein. Amino acid analysis of A. variabilis allophycocyanin subunits showed that the derivative at position 71 can account for the total methylamine released from the beta subunit, while hydrolysis of the alpha subunit released no methylamine. The beta subunits of the allophycocyanins from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 6301 and the red alga Porphyridium cruentum each released 1 eq of methylamine upon acid hydrolysis. No methylamine was released from the alpha subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1529179340,"Chloroperoxidase, horseradish peroxidase, hemoglobin, myoglobin, lactoperoxidase, and microperoxidase catalyzed the ethyl hydroperoxide-dependent oxidation of N-methylcarbazole to N-(hydroxymethyl)carbazole and N-formylcarbazole as major products. Mass spectral analysis of the N-(hydroxymethyl)carbazole formed during the peroxidase-catalyzed N-demethylation of N-methylcarbazole in 18O-enriched medium indicated partial incorporation (7.5-25.9%) of solvent water oxygen into the carbinolamine intermediate in all systems investigated, suggesting that the peroxidase active site is partially accessible to solvent water during N-demethylation. In contrast, solvent water oxygen was not incorporated into the N-formylcarbazole formed during the peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of N-methylcarbazole. N-(Hydroxymethyl)carbazole was not further metabolized by the peroxidases in the presence of ethyl hydroperoxide, indicating that it is not an intermediate in N-formylcarbazole formation. The horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed formation of N-formylcarbazole was decreased by 77% when the hydroperoxide-supported reactions were carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere, while the formation of N-(hydroxymethyl)carbazole was decreased by 46%. When the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed reactions were carried out in a 18O2 atmosphere, 18O incorporation into N-(hydroxymethyl)carbazole was 64.4% of the total oxygen, while 81.8% of the oxygen incorporated into N-formylcarbazole came from 18O2. These results suggest that there are two different mechanisms for the formation of N-(hydroxymethyl)carbazole, both involving the initial oxidation of N-methylcarbazole to a neutral carbon-centered radical. The radical can be further oxidized in the enzyme active site to an iminium cation, which reacts with water derived from either the oxidant or the medium to form the carbinolamine. Alternatively, the substrate radical can react with molecular oxygen to form a hydroperoxy radical, which decomposes to form the carboxaldehyde and carbinolamine."
https://openalex.org/W190994300,"It has been shown previously, using G-actin labeled with N-iodoacetyl-N'-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylene-diamine, that Mg2+ induces a conformational change in monomeric G-actin as a consequence of binding to a tight divalent cation binding site (Frieden, C. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2882-2886). Using the same fluorescent probe, we show that, subsequent to the Mg2+-induced conformational change, cytochalasin D induces a fluorescence decrease. The data are consistent with a mechanism which proposes that, after Mg2+ binding, cytochalasin D binds and induces a second conformational change which results in overall tight binding of the cytochalasin. The initial binding of cytochalasin D to monomeric actin labeled with the fluorescent probe was found to be 200 microM, and the forward and reverse rate constants for the subsequent conformational change were 350 s-1 and 8 s-1, respectively, with an overall dissociation constant to the Mg2+-induced form of 4.6 microM. The conformational change does not occur in monomeric actin in the presence of Ca2+ rather than Mg2+, but Ca2+ competes with Mg2+ for the tight binding site on the G-actin molecule. Direct binding studies show that actin which has not been labeled with the fluorophore binds cytochalasin D more tightly. The conformational change induced by Mg2+ and cytochalasin D precedes the formation of an actin dimer."
https://openalex.org/W139835909,"We have previously shown that the glucosidase inhibitor, N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin (MedJN), only partially inhibited N-linked complex oligosaccharide biosynthesis in F9 teratocarcinoma cells whereas the alpha-mannosidase I inhibitor, manno-1-deoxynojirimycin, completely prevented this synthesis (Romero, P. A. and Herscovics, A. (1986) Carbohydr. Res. 151, 21-28). In order to determine whether a pathway independent of processing glucosidases can occur, F9 cells were pulse-labeled for 2 min with D-[2-3H]mannose in the presence or absence of 2 mM MedJN. In control cells, Man7GlcNAc was identified in the protein-bound oligosaccharides released with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, in addition to the expected Glc1-3Man9GlcNAc and Man9GlcNAc arising from processing of Glc3Man9GlcNAc. MedJN completely prevented the removal of glucose residues from Glc3Man9GlcNAc, but did not greatly affect the appearance of Man7GlcNAc associated with protein. Labeled Man7GlcNAc was also found in the lipid-linked oligosaccharides of both control and treated cells. The 2-min pulse-labeled Man7GlcNAc obtained from both the lipid and protein fractions were shown to have identical structures by concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography and by acetolysis and were clearly different from the Man7GlcNAc obtained from the usual processing pathway. These results demonstrate that transfer of a nonglucosylated oligosaccharide (Man7GlcNAc2) from dolichyl pyrophosphate to protein occurs in F9 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1561849216,"The synthesis of a major heat shock protein (HSP 70) was measured in HeLa cells incubated at 42.5 degrees C and then transferred to 37 degrees C or 30 degrees C. After 90 min, synthesis of HSP 70 decreased by 54 and 85%, respectively, whereas HSP 70 mRNA was reduced at most by 20%. Therefore, the reduced synthesis of HSP 70 could not be accounted for by mRNA turnover. HSP 70 was associated with large polyribosomes (6-10 ribosomes) in cells kept at 42.5 degrees C, but with medium or small polyribosomes in cells transferred to 37 degrees C or 30 degrees C (5-6 or 2-3 ribosomes, respectively). Addition of puromycin to these cells resulted in the release of all ribosomes from HSP 70 mRNA, indicating that they were translationally active. The regulation of HSP 70 synthesis was investigated in cell-free systems prepared from heat-shocked or control cells and incubated at 30 degrees C and 42 degrees C. After 5 min at 42 degrees C, the cell-free system from heat-shocked cells synthesized protein at 3 times the rate of the control cell-free system. This difference was in large part due to synthesis of HSP 70. Addition of HSP mRNA to the control cell-free system stimulated protein synthesis at 42 degrees C, but not at 30 degrees C. These findings suggest that translation of HSP 70 mRNA is specifically promoted at high temperature and repressed during recovery from heat shock by regulatory mechanisms active at the level of initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1517117095,"Cultured A6 epithelial cells from toad kidney form confluent monolayers with tight junctions separating the apical and basolateral membranes. These two membrane domains have distinct compositions and functions. Thus, sodium is actively transported across the epithelia from the apical to basolateral surface via amiloride-inhibitable sodium channels located in the apical membrane. Sodium transport is stimulated by vasopressin, cholera toxin, and 8-bromo-cAMP applied to the basolateral surface where the receptors, adenylate cyclase, and Na+/K+-ATPase are located. In a previous study (Spiegel, S., Blumenthal, R., Fishman, P.H., and Handler, J.S. (1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 821, 310-318), we demonstrated that exogenous gangliosides inserted into the apical membrane of A6 epithelia do not redistribute to the basolateral membrane. With the ability to vary selectively the ganglioside composition of the apical membrane, we examined the effects of gangliosides on sodium transport in A6 epithelia. When the apical surface of A6 epithelia were exposed to exogenous gangliosides, sodium transport in response to vasopressin, cholera toxin, and 8-bromo-cAMP was enhanced compared to epithelia not exposed to gangliosides. The effect was observed with bovine brain gangliosides, NeuAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3GalNAc beta 1----4[NeuAc alpha 2----3]Gal beta 1----4Glc beta 1----Cer (GD1a) and Gal beta-1----3GalNAc beta 1----4[NeuAc alpha 2----3]Gal beta 1----4Glc beta 1----Cer (GM1), but not with the less complex ganglioside, Neu-Ac alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4Glc beta 1----Cer (GM3). We examined A6 cells for endogenous gangliosides and found that, whereas GM3 was a major ganglioside, only trace amounts of GM1 and GD1a were present. Based on cell surface and metabolic labeling studies, these gangliosides were synthesized by the cells and were present on the apical as well as the basolateral surface. Bacterial sialidase, which hydrolyzes more complex gangliosides to GM1, was used to modify the endogenous gangliosides on the apical surface; after sialidase treatment, the epithelia were more responsive to vasopressin, cholera toxin, and 8-bromo-cAMP. Thus, gangliosides may be modulators of sodium channels present in the apical membrane of epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2111184928,"Transient incubation of chicken lymphoblastoid (MSB) cells at elevated temperatures induces the synthesis of three heat shock proteins of 89,000 Da (HSP89), 70,000 Da (HSP70), and 23,000 Da (HSP23). We have examined the effects of heat shock on the transcription and post-transcriptional regulation of the chicken HSP70 and beta-actin genes. The rate of HSP70 transcription is rapidly induced by heat shock, reaches maximal levels by 60 min, and thereafter decreases. The level of HSP70 mRNA increases 20-fold by 60 min and remains constant through 6 h of heat shock. Upon return of heat-shocked cells to normal growth temperatures, the level of HSP70 mRNA rapidly decreases to pre-heat shock levels. These results suggest that HSP70 mRNA is stably maintained and translated during heat shock, but rapidly degraded during recovery from heat shock. The effect of heat shock on beta-actin mRNA is opposite to the apparent stabilizing effects of elevated temperatures on HSP70 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1987570493,Fibers composed of molecules of deoxygenated sickle cell hemoglobin are the basic cause of pathology in sickle cell disease. The hemoglobin molecules in these fibers are arranged in double strands that twist around one another with a long axial repeat. These fibrous aggregates exhibit a pattern of polymorphism in which the ratio of their helical pitch to their radius is approximately constant. The observed ratio agrees with an estimate of its value calculated from the geometric properties of helical assemblies and the degree of distortion that a protein-protein interface can undergo. This agreement indicates that the radius of an aggregate is limited by the maximum possible stretching of double strands. The geometric properties limiting the radial extent of sickle hemoglobin fibers are fundamental to all cables of protein filaments and could contribute to the control of diameter in other biological fibers such as collagen or fibrin.
https://openalex.org/W1500223187,"Abstract The kinetics of electron transfer within the molybdoflavoenzyme xanthine oxidase has been investigated using the technique of pulse radiolysis. Subsequent to one-electron reduction of native enzyme at 20 degrees C in 20 mM pyrophosphate buffer, pH 8.5, using the CO-.2 species as reductant, a spectral change is observed having a rate constant of approximately 290 s-1. From its wavelength dependence, this spectral change is assigned to the transfer of an electron from flavin semiquinone (formed on reaction with the CO2-. species) to one of the iron-sulfur centers of the enzyme in an intramolecular equilibration process. The value for this rate constant agrees well with the 330 s-1 observed in previous stopped-flow pH-jump experiments carried out at 25 degrees C (Hille, R., and Massey, V. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1241-1247). Experimental results with fully reduced enzyme reacting with the radiolytically generated N.3 species also support the conclusion that the equilibration of reducing equivalents among the oxidation-reduction centers of xanthine oxidase is a rapid process. Evidence is also found that xanthine oxidase possesses an unusually reactive disulfide bond that is reduced rapidly by radiolytically generated radicals. The ramifications of the present results with regard to the interpretation of experiments involving chemically reactive radical species, generated either by photolysis or radiolysis, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2092913056,"Long-term potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting enhancement of synaptic efficacy, is considered a model for learning and memory. In anesthetized rats, activation of dentate granule cells by stimulating either the medial or lateral perforant pathway at frequencies of 100 to 400 Hz produced LTP of the stimulated pathway preferentially at 400 Hz. However, hippocampal pathways do not normally fire at this high rate. Stimuli at 200 Hz were then applied to either the medial or lateral pathway separately, to both pathways simultaneously, or to the two pathways asynchronously so that the composite stimulus applied to the granule cell dendrite was 400 Hz. LTP was produced preferentially in the asynchronous condition. Thus, lower frequency, physiological input volleys arriving asynchronously at medial and lateral synapses can induce LTP by activating a 400-Hz sensitive mechanism capable of integrating spatially separated granule cell inputs. This may reflect how LTP is normally produced in the dentate gyrus."
https://openalex.org/W1543538224,"The ortho-, meta-, and para-trifluoromethylphenylhydrazine inhibitors of porcine plasma amine oxidase were synthesized. Titrations of plasma amine oxidase with these inhibitors demonstrated that 1 mol of trifluoromethylphenylhydrazine completely and irreversibly modifies 1 mol of enzyme by covalently binding to the active carbonyl cofactor. NMR relaxation measurements on the fluorine nuclei were obtained at 188.22 and 74.84 MHz for each inhibitor-enzyme adduct. These measurements were used to calculate the exact distance and orientation between the inhibitor-binding site and the copper cofactor. The copper lies in the plane of the aromatic ring of the inhibitor at distances of 10.9, 14.3, and 15.5 A from the fluorines in the ortho-, meta-, and para- positions of the ring, respectively. Since the inhibitors react with the active carbonyl cofactor, this defines the relationship between the copper and the active carbonyl cofactor in the enzyme, and provides a basis for choosing between mechanisms for the transfer of electrons from the amine substrate to oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W2055830320,"Epidemiology has evolved from its historic origins as the study of major epidemics and vital statistics to a contemporary focus on the study of the distribution and determinants of health and disease in humans. This evolution reflects changes in the patterns of diseases and deaths that have occurred in our time and has placed new emphasis on preventing avoidable, premature deaths. Advances in clinical medicine, laboratory science, statistical and data handling methods, and in our basic understanding of the pathogenesis of disease have enabled epidemiologists to better examine causes of disease and to propose more effective strategies for prevention and control."
https://openalex.org/W1578408918,"Chromatin solubility was observed at several concentrations of various cations. Spermine and spermidine precipitated (50%) chromatin at about 0.2 mM, Ca2+ and Mg2+ at about 1-2 mM, and Na+ at about 100 mM. Further increases in cation concentration induced more aggregation, but eventually excess cation increased chromatin solubility so that 50% solubility was observed again at 60 mM Mg2+ and 180 mM Na+. H1 histone was 50% released by 80 mM MgCl2 or 425 mM NaCl. Combinations of MgCl2 and NaCl showed that Mg2+ and Na+ are synergistic in the induction of aggregation in lower concentrations (less than 2 mM) of Mg2+ but antagonistic at higher concentrations, and a similar effect of NaCl on spermidine-induced precipitation was shown below and above about 0.2 mM spermidine. At 5 mM, MgCl2 proved capable of precipitating chromatin depleted of H1 histone, but no concentration of NaCl was capable of doing so. These phenomena can be rationalized by supposing that neutralization of chromatin by any cation (including H1 histone) favors aggregation and also that cross-linking of chromatin fibers by multivalent cations (including H1 histone) is also critically important. The exchange of H1 histone between chromatin fragments was tested in various concentrations of different salts. H1 exchange was correlated with chromatin aggregation rather than with ionic strength and thus appears to depend on fiber to fiber contact. Under conditions where H1 exchanges between chromatin fibers that are permitted to make contact with each other, no H1 exchange occurred between chromatin inside the nucleus and chromatin outside, even though H1 histone is capable of passage through the nuclear membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2421254654,"Fatty acid reduction in Photobacterium phosphoreum is catalyzed in a coupled reaction by two enzymes: acyl-protein synthetase, which activates fatty acids (+ATP), and a reductase, which reduces activated fatty acids (+NADPH) to aldehyde. Although the synthetase and reductase can be acylated with fatty acid (+ATP) and acyl-CoA, respectively, evidence for acyl transfer between these proteins has not yet been obtained. Experimental conditions have now been developed to increase significantly (5-30-fold) the level of protein acylation so that 0.4-0.8 mol of fatty acyl groups are incorporated per mole of the synthetase or reductase subunit. The acylated reductase polypeptide migrated faster on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis than the unlabeled polypeptide, with a direct 1 to 1 correspondence between the moles of acyl group incorporated and the moles of polypeptide migrating at this new position. The presence of 2-mercaptoethanol or NADPH, but not NADP, substantially decreased labeling of the reductase enzyme, and kinetic studies demonstrated that the rate of covalent incorporation of the acyl group was 3-5 times slower than its subsequent reduction with NADPH to aldehyde. When mixtures of the synthetase and reductase polypeptides were incubated with [3H] tetradecanoic acid (+ATP) or [3H]tetradecanoyl-CoA, both polypeptides were acylated to high levels, with the labeling again being decreased by 2-mercaptoethanol or NADPH. These results have demonstrated that acylation of the reductase represents an intermediate and rate-limiting step in fatty acid reduction. Moreover, the activated acyl groups are transferred in a reversible reaction between the synthetase and reductase proteins in the enzyme mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1493274915,The host range of bacteriophage Mu is regulated through an invertible segment. Inversion requires the presence of two properly oriented recombination sites and a recombinational enhancer sis. The reaction is catalyzed by the Mu-encoded DNA invertase Gin and a host factor termed factors for inversion stimulation (FISs). We present a novel purification scheme for Gin. Purified Gin alone catalyzes the inversion reaction at very low efficiency recombining less than 0.8% of substrate molecules. When supplemented with FIS substrates containing the recombinational enhancer are recombined efficiently. Stoichiometric amounts of Gin are required for recombination.
https://openalex.org/W1510502184,"Glycogen phosphorylase a and b are irreversibly inactivated by oxidation with the disulfide cystamine. The mechanism is complex and involves oxidation of at least two classes of sulfhydryl groups. The oxidation of one or more of the first class of 4 +/- 1 sulfhydryl groups is reversible, but the equilibrium constant for the oxidation is so unfavorable (1 X 10(-4)) that the micromolar concentrations of cysteamine released stoichiometrically with enzyme oxidation are sufficient to prevent complete oxidation even in the presence of 100 mM cystamine. The rapid phase of inactivation of phosphorylase b, which is first order in cystamine (k = 2.9 +/- 0.3 M-1 min-1), is followed by the oxidation of 5 +/- 1 groups in an irreversible process that is second order in cystamine concentration (k = 3.9 +/- M-2 min-1). Similar behavior is observed for phosphorylase a, although the behavior is complicated by association/dissociation equilibrium. The second-order dependence of the rate of irreversible inactivation on cystamine concentration is interpreted in terms of a cooperative model in which a rapidly reversible thermodynamically unfavorable equilibrium oxidation of one or more sulfhydryl groups must precede the irreversible oxidation of one or more additional sulfhydryl groups. The thiol/disulfide oxidation equilibrium constant for the initial reversible reaction is estimated to be at least 10(4) less favorable than that for the reversible oxidation of phosphofructokinase."
https://openalex.org/W1897722498,"Bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase reacts covalently with the adenine nucleotide analogue 2-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutylthio)adenosine 5'-monophosphate (2-BDB-TAMP) with incorporation of about 1 mol of reagent/mol of enzyme subunit. The modified enzyme is not inactivated by this reaction as measured in the absence of allosteric effectors. Native glutamate dehydrogenase is activated by ADP and inhibited by high concentrations of NADH; both of these effects are irreversibly decreased upon reaction of the enzyme with 2-BDB-TAMP. The decrease in activation by ADP was used to determine the rate constant for reaction with 2-BDB-TAMP. The rate constant (kobs) for loss of ADP activation exhibits a nonlinear dependence on 2-BDB-TAMP concentration, suggesting a reversible binding of reagent (KR = 0.74 mM) prior to irreversible modification. At 1.2 mM 2-BDB-TAMP, kobs = 0.060 min-1 and is not affected by alpha-ketoglutarate or GTP, but is decreased to 0.020 min-1 by 5 mM NADH and to zero by 5 mM ADP. Incorporation after incubation with 1.2 mM 2-BDB-TAMP for 1 h at pH 7.1 is 1.02 mol/mol enzyme subunit in the absence but only 0.09 mol/subunit in the presence of ADP. The enzyme protected with 5 mM ADP behaves like native enzyme in its activation by ADP and in its inhibition by NADH. Native enzyme binds reversibly 2 mol of [14C]ADP/subunit, whereas modified enzyme binds only 1 mol of ADP/peptide chain. These results indicate that incorporation of 1 mol of 2-BDB-TAMP causes elimination of one of the ADP sites of the native enzyme. 2-BDB-TAMP acts as an affinity label of an ADP site of glutamate dehydrogenase and indirectly influences the NADH inhibitory site."
https://openalex.org/W342806619,"Porcine pancreatic DNase has been purified to homogeneity. The polypeptide exhibits a single band of Mr = 34,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme is a glycoprotein containing glucosamine. The results of end group analyses show leucine at the NH2 terminus and alanine at the COOH terminus. The enzymatic properties of the purified porcine DNase are very similar to those of bovine and ovine DNases. The sequence data on the tryptic and chymotryptic peptides derived from CNBr fragments of porcine DNase, along with the results of automated Edman degradation of the intact polypeptide and of the two largest CNBr fragments, indicate the complete amino acid sequence of porcine DNase to be as follows:L-R- I-A-F-N-I-R-T-F-G-E-T-K-M-S-N-A-T-S-N-Y-I-V-R-I-L-S-R-Y-D-I-A-L-I-Q- E-V-R-D-S-H-L-T-A-V-G-K-L-L-N-E-L-N-Q-D-D-P-N-N-Y-H-H-V-V-S-E-P-L-G-R- S-T-Y-K-E-R-Y-L-F-V-F-R-P-N-Q-V-S-V-L-D-S-Y-L-Y-D-D-G-C-E-P-C-G-N-D-T- F-N-R-E-P-S-V-V-K-F-S-S-P-F-T-Q-V-K-E-F-A-I-V-P-L-H-A-A-P-S-D-A-A-A-E- I-N-S-L-Y-D-V-Y-L-N-V-R-Q-K-W-D-L-Q-D-I-M-L-M-G-D-F-N-A-G-C-S-Y-V-T- T-S-H-W-S-S-I-R-L-R-E-S-P-P-F-Q-W-L-I-P-D-T-A-D-T-T-V-S-S-H-T-C-A-Y- D-R-I-V-V-A-G-P-L-L-Q-R-A-V-V-P-D-S-A-A-P-F-D-F-Q-A-A-F-G-L-S-Q-E-T- A-L-A-I-S-D-H-Y-P-V-E-V-T-L-K-R-A. The polypeptide consists of 262 amino acid residues. One of the two disulfide loops links Cys-101 and Cys-104 and the other Cys-173 and Cys-209.

https://openalex.org/W1670756326,"113Cd and 31P NMR have been used to investigate the interactions of inhibitors with the metal ion of bovine carboxypeptidase A, using 113Cd as a replacement for the native zinc atom. In the absence of inhibitor and over the pH range 6-9, no 113Cd resonance is visible at room temperature. Upon lowering the temperature to 270 K, however, a broad resonance can be seen at 120 ppm. These results are discussed in terms of possible sources for this resonance modulation. Binding of low molecular weight inhibitors containing potential metal-coordinating moieties results in the appearance of a sharp 113Cd resonance. These inhibitors all bind to the metal ion, a fact which is reflected in the chemical shift of the cadmium resonance and, for L-phenylalanine phosphoramidate phenyl ester, by two-bond 113Cd-31P spin-spin coupling of 30 Hz in the 31P resonance of the bound inhibitor. For inhibitors that coordinate to the metal ion via oxygen, the 113Cd chemical shift is in the range 127-137 ppm, whereas for sulfur coordination there is a downfield shift of approximately 210 ppm. The complexes of 113Cd-substituted carboxypeptidase A with the D and L isomers of thiolactic acid are distinguished by a difference of 11 ppm in the chemical shift of their cadmium resonances. The enzyme complex formed with the macromolecular inhibitor from potatoes, which fills the S1 and S2 subsites, shows one or possibly two closely spaced broad 113Cd resonances. Both the chemical shift and the line width of the 113Cd resonances of the [113Cd]carboxypeptidase-inhibitor complexes give valuable structural and dynamic information about the enzyme active site."
