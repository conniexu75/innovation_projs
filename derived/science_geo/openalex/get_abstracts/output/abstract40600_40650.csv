https://openalex.org/W2084627994,"Studies of the genomic structure of human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) and related viruses, implicated as the causal agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), have identified a sixth open reading frame in addition to the five previously known within the genome (gag, pol, sor, env and 3'orf). This gene, called tat-III, lies between the sor and env genes and is able to mediate activation, in a trans configuration, of the genes linked to HTLV-III long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences. We now present evidence that the product of tat-III is an absolute requirement for virus expression. We show that derivatives of a biologically competent molecular clone of HTLV-III, in which the tat-III gene is deleted or the normal splicing abrogated, failed to produce or expressed unusually low levels of virus, respectively, when transfected into T-cell cultures. The capacity of these tat-III-defective genomes was transiently restored by co-transfection of a plasmid clone containing a functional tat-III gene or by introducing the TAT-III protein itself. As HTLV-III and related viruses are the presumed causal agents of AIDS and associated conditions, the observation that tat-III is critical for HTLV-III replication has important clinical implications, and suggests that specific inhibition of the activity of tat-III could be a novel and effective therapeutic approach to the treatment of AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W1971038748,"Evidence is presented that ergot alkaloids are ubiquitous in tall fescue pastures infected with the clavicipitaceous fungal endophyte Sphacelia typhina (or Acremonium coenophialum). Ergopeptide alkaloids, predominantly ergovaline, constituted 10 to 50 percent of the total ergot alkaloid concentration, which was as high as 14 milligrams per kilogram in sheaths and 1.5 milligrams per kilogram in blades. Ergot alkaloid concentrations were substantially increased by application of large amounts (10 millimoles per liter) of potassium nitrate or ammonium chloride to infected plants in the greenhouse. The results indicate that ergot alkaloids are probably responsible for the toxicity to cattle of this common pasture and lawn grass and that ergotism-like toxicoses may be caused by clavicipitaceous fungi other than Claviceps."

https://openalex.org/W1498607624,"Despite quantitative differences, the activity of basic and acidic fibroblast growth factors (FGF) on a wide variety of normal diploid cells derived from neuroectoderm and mesoderm is intrinsically similar. This suggests that they bind to the same cell surface receptors. This was investigated using a baby hamster kidney cell line (BHK-21) as a model. BHK-21 cell membrane components that interact with basic and acidic FGF have been identified by covalent cross-linking to their respective 125I-labeled ligands. Under appropriate conditions, basic and acidic 125I-FGF were cross-linked, using disuccinimidyl suberate, to two receptor species with apparent molecular masses of 145,000 and 125,000 daltons, respectively. The labeling of those receptors is inhibited when either native basic or acidic FGF are present in excess during incubation of cells with either acidic or basic 125I-FGF. Competition of basic 125I-FGF with increasing concentrations of native acidic FGF results in a preferential decrease in the labeling of the 125,000-dalton species, whereas competition of acidic 125I-FGF with increasing concentrations of native basic FGF leads to a preferential decrease in the labeling of the 145,000-dalton species. The data suggest that qualitatively both mitogens interact with the same 145,000- and 125,000-dalton receptor species. The different affinities displayed by acidic and basic FGF toward their common receptor molecules could explain why acidic FGF, depending on the cell type considered, is 20-100-fold less potent than basic FGF."
https://openalex.org/W2094768993,"The discovery that the aetiological agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a retro virus, referred to as human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) or lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) (for review see ref. 1), has raised the possibility of developing a vaccine. In this regard, the envelope (env) proteins of murine retroviruses can induce protective immunity in mice2,3. The HTLV-III env gene specifies a primary polypeptide of ∼860 amino acids that is glycosylated to form a precursor of relative molecular mass (Mr) 160,000 (gp160), which gives rise to mature membrane-associated proteins4–9 of Mr 120,000 (gp120) and 41,000 (gp41). The HTLV-III env gene has been expressed in Escherichia coli10 and by simian virus 40 (SV40) vectors5 but formation of the authentic proteins has not been demonstrated. Here, we describe the expression of the complete env gene by a vaccinia virus vector. Evidence is presented that synthesis, glycosylation, processing and membrane transport of the env polypeptide occurred without other HTLV-III gene functions; the env protein was recognized by sera from unrelated AIDs patients; and a single vaccination with the infectious recombinant vaccinia virus induced antibodies to gp120 in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2022009363,"Recent studies have shown that gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) induces the expression of Ia antigen on astrocytes. This observation is of immunological significance because such activated astrocytes can act as antigen-presenting cells, as demonstrated with myelin basic protein for antigen-specific encephalitogenic T-cell lines. However, the lack of lymphatic drainage in brain and the presence of the so-called blood-brain barrier restricting traffic of cells and macromolecules suggests that IFN-gamma may not be readily available, at least during the initial phases of viral infections. The question therefore arises as to whether astrocytes can be induced to express Ia antigens by other signals directly related to viral infection and possibly independent of IFN-gamma. In the present report we demonstrate that a neurotropic murine hepatitis virus induces expression of Ia antigen on astrocytes in tissue culture without infection, rendering these brain cells competent to participate directly in the immune response to a viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W1530888481,"Na-Ca exchange activity in bovine cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles was stimulated up to 10-fold by preincubating the vesicles with 1 microM FeSO4 plus 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in a NaCl medium. The increase in activity was not reversed upon removing the Fe and DTT. Stimulation of exchange activity under these conditions was completely blocked by 0.1 mM EDTA or o-phenanthroline; this suggests that the production of reduced oxygen species (H2O2, O2-.,.OH) during Fecatalyzed DTT oxidation might be involved in stimulating exchange activity. In agreement with this hypothesis, the increase in exchange activity in the presence of Fe-DTT was inhibited 80% by anaerobiosis and 60% by catalase. H2O2 (0.1 mM) potentiated the stimulation of Na-Ca exchange by Fe-DTT under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions; H2O2 also produced an increase in activity in the presence of either FeSO4 (1 microM) or DTT (1 mM), but it had no effect on activity by itself. Superoxide dismutase did not block the effects of Fe-DTT on exchange activity; however, the generation of O2-. by xanthine oxidase in the presence of an oxidizable substrate stimulated activity more than 2-fold. Hydroxyl radical scavenging agents (mannitol, sodium formate, sodium benzoate) did not attenuate the stimulation of activity observed with Fe-H2O2. Exchange activity was also stimulated by the simultaneous presence of glutathione (GSH; 1-2 mM) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG; 1-2 mM). Neither GSH nor GSSG was effective by itself and either 0.1 mM EDTA or o-phenanthroline blocked the effects on transport activity of the combination of GSH + GSSG. Treatment of the GSH and GSSG solutions with Chelex ion-exchange resin to remove contaminating transition metal ions reduced (by 40%) the degree of stimulation observed with GSH + GSSG. Full stimulating activity was restored to the Chelex-treated GSH and GSSG solutions by the addition of 1 microM Fe2+; Cu2+ was less effective than Fe2+ whereas Co2+ and Mn2+ were without effect. In the presence of 1 microM Fe2+, GSH alone produced a slight increase in transport activity, but this was markedly enhanced by the addition of Chelex-treated GSSG. The results indicate that stimulation of exchange activity requires the presence of both a reducing agent (DTT, GSH, O-.2, or Fe2+) and an oxidizing agent (H2O2, GSSG, and perhaps O2) and that the effects of these agents are mediated by metal ions (e.g. Fe2+).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W2157588675,"Two polypeptides from secretory products of human hepatoma cells were isolated and characterized on the basis of their stimulation of maintenance and growth of human endothelial cells in serum-free cell culture. Both factors were purified to homogeneity by a combination of reverse-phase, ion exchange, and molecular filtration high performance liquid chromatography. One factor (endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF-2a) had Mr approximately 6,500 and pI near 6. The second (ECGF-2b) had Mr = 27,000 and a pI below 4.0. Both ECGF-2a and ECGF-2b exhibited single NH2-terminal sequences. The first 25 NH2-terminal residues of ECGF-2a and the first 49 residues of ECGF-2b were determined by gas-phase microsequencing. All clearly determined residues of ECGF-2a were identical with human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor. All assignable residues of ECGF-2b were identical with urinary glycoprotein proteinase inhibitor (HI-30/EDC1). Both proteins are absent or at low levels in normal plasma and urine, but appear during acute inflammatory disease and cancer. Amino acid composition of ECGF-2a and ECGF-2b was also similar to human pancreatic secretory inhibitor and HI-30/EDC1, respectively. Both ECGF-2a and ECGF-2b inhibited bovine pancreatic trypsin (2 micrograms/ml) by 50% at 750 ng/ml. ECGF-2a and ECGF-2b stimulated endothelial cell number at a half-maximal dose of 50 ng/ml (8 nM) and 80 to 130 ng/ml (5 to 9 nM) protein, respectively. When assayed under identical conditions, no effect of either factor on human smooth muscle cells, human hepatoma cells, or human, rat, and mouse fibroblasts could be detected."
https://openalex.org/W1521619375,"Collagenase in human neutrophils is found within intracellular granules which can be stimulated to be secreted with phorbol myristic acetate. This extracellular secreted form of neutrophil collagenase was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody previously shown to specifically recognize neutrophil collagenase. The enzyme efficiently bound to this column and was eluted with NaSCN as three major species of 75, 57, and 22 kDa, respectively. These proteins were closely related immunologically since, after radiolabeling and separation by gel filtration, each of the three proteins was precipitated by the monoclonal antibody. Also, the 75- and 57-kDa proteins exhibited collagenase activity after elution from polyacrylamide gels run under nondenaturing conditions. Further, the 57-kDa protein autodegraded into a 22-kDa protein with time. Polyclonal antibody, prepared to the 57-kDa enzyme, also recognized the 75- and 22-kDa proteins using an immunoblot technique. When crude neutrophil supernatants containing latent collagenase were immunoblotted, both the 75- and the 57-kDa enzymes were present. Our immunoaffinity purified active enzymes, although activated during the course of purification, resemble the latent enzymes in crude neutrophil supernatants. The multiple forms of secreted collagenase from degranulated leukocytes may resemble more closely that seen in inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1576342917,"We have purified CTP:phosphorylcholine cytidylyltransferase from rat liver cytosol 2180-fold to a specific activity of 12,250 nmol/min/mg of protein. The purified enzyme was stable at -70 degrees C in the presence of Triton X-100 and 0.2 M phosphate. The purified enzyme gave a single protein and activity band on nondenaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis indicated that the purified enzyme contained subunits with Mr of 39,000 and 48,000. Gel filtration analysis indicated that the native enzyme was a tetramer containing two 39,000 and two 48,000 subunits. The purified enzyme appeared to bind to Triton X-100 micelles, one molecule of tetramer/micelle. Maximal activity was obtained with 100 microM phosphatidylcholine-oleic acid vesicles (8-10-fold stimulation). Phosphatidylglycerol produced a 4-5-fold increase in activity at 10 microM. The pH optimum and true Km values for CTP and phosphorylcholine were similar to those reported previously for crude preparations of cytidylyltransferase. The overall behavior of cytidylyltransferase during purification and subsequent analysis suggested that it has hydrophobic properties similar to those exhibited by membrane proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1499426087,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the uvrA gene of Escherichia coli. The coding region of the gene is 2820 base pairs which specifies a protein of 940 amino acids and Mr = 103,874. The polypeptide sequence predicted from the DNA sequence was confirmed by analyzing the UvrA protein: the sequence of the first 7 NH2-terminal amino acids as well as the amino acid composition of the pure protein agreed with those predicted from the nucleotide sequence. By comparing the sequence of UvrA protein to the amino acid sequences of other ATPases, we found that two regions in the UvrA protein, separated from one another by about 600 amino acids, have the highly conserved G-X4-GKT(S)-X6-I(V) sequence found at the active sites of many, but not all, ATPases. Our findings suggest that UvrA protein may have two ATP binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2046211622,"Anterior pituitaries from the dwarf mouse strain ""little"" did not release growth hormone or accumulate adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in response to human and rat growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF). Dibutyryl cyclic AMP, as well as the adenylate cyclase stimulators forskolin and cholera toxin, markedly stimulated growth hormone (GH) release. The basis of the GH deficiency in the little mouse may therefore be a defect in an early stage of GRF-stimulated GH release related either to receptor binding or to the function of the hormone-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1484146455,"The metabolic energy dependency of Na+/H+ exchange activity was investigated in cultured human A431 carcinoma cells and foreskin fibroblasts. Following the activation of Na+/H+ exchange which results from loading cells with Na+ or Li+, depletion of cellular ATP by incubation with metabolic inhibitors causes an inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange activity. This inhibition is reversible and correlates with the extent of the reduction in the ATP pool. On the other hand, reduction of the intracellular pH (pHi) to approximately 6.0-6.2 results in a similar effective activation of Na+/H+ exchange in both control and ATP-depleted cells. Na+/H+ exchange activity in ATP-depleted cells that either have or have not been loaded with Na+ shows a steep dependency on pHi, being essentially abolished above pHi of 6.4-6.5, whereas control cells show a considerable activity also at more alkaline pHi values. Thus, Na+/H+ exchange activity in ATP-depleted cells shows an increased dependency on intracellular protons. These findings suggest that although metabolic energy is not required as a driving force for Na+/H+ antiport, depletion of metabolic energy substrates inhibits the antiporter activity due to a modulation of an intracellular proton-dependent regulatory mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1537673842,"1-Alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkylacetyl-GPC, platelet activating factor (PAF] can be biosynthesized either by acetylation of alkyllyso-GPC through a remodeling pathway or by the transfer of phosphocholine to alkylacetyl-sn-glycerol (alkylacetyl-G) via a putative de novo pathway involving a dithiothreitol-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase. However, the relevance of the de novo pathway in the biosynthesis of PAF depends on the existence of enzymes that can directly synthesize alkylacetyl-G from 1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-P (alkyllyso-GP) or some other source. In this study, we demonstrated that microsomal preparations of rat spleen can synthesize alkylacetyl-GP by an alkyllyso-GP:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase and that this intermediate is subsequently dephosphorylated by an alkylacetyl-GP phosphohydrolase to generate alkylacetyl-G. The properties of alkyllyso-GP:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase were characterized under conditions where the contaminating activity of alkylacetyl-GP phosphohydrolase was minimal; this was accomplished by inhibiting the phosphohydrolase with the addition of sodium vanadate and sodium fluoride to the assay mixtures and incubating at relatively low temperatures (23 degrees C). Alkyllyso-GP:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase had a pH optimum of 8.4 at 23 degrees C and was located in the microsomal fraction. The apparent Km for acetyl-CoA under these conditions was 226 microM and the optimal concentration of alkyllyso-GP ranged between 16 and 25 microM. Based on pH optima, substrate inhibition studies, and sensitivities to preincubation temperatures of the microsomes, it appears that alkyllyso-GP:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase differs from the acetyltransferase responsible for the transfer of acetate from acetyl-CoA to alkyllyso-GPC to form PAF. A variety of tissues had high activities of alkyllyso-GP:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, which indicates that this pathway is operational in many cell types. Our results document the existence of a complete de novo biosynthetic pathway for the assembly of PAF, and this route could be responsible for maintaining physiological levels of platelet activating factor for normal cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1518426335,"Abstract We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding rat liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP). Previous structural studies have shown that L-FABP belongs to a family of low molecular weight cytosolic proteins which bind hydrophobic ligands. Rat L-FABP is the first member of this family whose genomic organization has been defined. The L-FABP transcription unit spans 3790 nucleotides and contains four exons (115, 173, 93, and 121 base pairs) interrupted by three introns (1454, 1224, and 610 base pairs). No other abundant mRNAs appear to be transcribed from sequences located within 4 kilobases 5' or 6.5 kilobases 3' of this gene. Sequence analyses have detected the presence of several related amino acid sequence blocks within L-FABP which may serve similar structural roles. A variety of computational techniques were used to compare the oligopeptides specified by each exon with other known members of the protein family. The results indicate that only the amino acid sequence present in the first exon is conserved among the homologous proteins. This suggests that the first exon may encode a shared structural and functional domain important in the interaction of these proteins with their ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1514610804,"The nrdB gene of Escherichia coli, coding for the B2 protein of ribonucleotide reductase, has been cloned in a runaway-replication vector. The runaway derivative pBEU17 carries the promoter-proximal portion of the E. coli alanyl-tRNA synthetase gene and proved useful for expressing cloned genes lacking their native transcription initiation signals. The alaS promoter is located approximately 500 base pairs upstream of a single BamHI restriction endonuclease cleavage site utilized in the construction of an expression recombinant plasmid, pBS1, for the nrdB product. After 5-h thermal induction of cells carrying the runaway recombinant pBS1, protein B2 constituted 40% of the soluble protein fraction of the cells. The high concentration of protein B2 in crude extracts of induced cells has enabled a simplified purification scheme to be developed for production of homogeneous and concentrated B2 preparations. Protein B2 produced from pBS1 is identical to the chromosomally encoded nrdB product of E. coli as regards molecular mass on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, enzyme activity, tyrosine radical content, and structure of the binuclear iron center. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that the two polypeptide chains of protein B2 are identical. They start with an alanine residue, and the first 30 residues confirmed the amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the nrdB gene, apart from an NH2-terminal processing removal of the initiator methionine."
https://openalex.org/W1530567208,"The effect of cholesterol on the activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase, reconstituted in proteoliposomes containing soybean phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), and cholesterol, was examined. The protein incorporation efficiency increased with PE content but appeared to be independent of cholesterol content. At low cholesterol, PE stimulated calcium uptake. The coupling efficiency of the proteoliposomes increased with an increase in cholesterol content at each PC/(PC + PE) ratio and was more pronounced for those proteoliposomes containing high PE. Dynamic fluorescence measurements of the incorporated lipophilic probe, diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, revealed a decrease in the motion and an increase in the order of the phospholipid fatty acyl chains in proteoliposomes with high cholesterol content. A complementary observation was made using electron spin resonance of the spin label, 2,2-dimethyl-5-dodecyl-5-methyloxazolidine N-oxide. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy studies on proteoliposomes containing 0.20 molar ratio of PC/(PC + PE) and cholesterol revealed predominantly vesicular structures with occasional bilayer defects at high cholesterol content. It is postulated that the cholesterol-induced enhancement of the Ca-transport function of the Ca-ATPase is related to the hydration-related bilayer-destabilizing characteristic of the cholesterol molecule as revealed by 31P NMR."
https://openalex.org/W1548714594,"Glandular kallikreins are a highly homologous subfamily of serine proteases encoded by 25 genes in the mouse. Several of the gene products have been implicated as having specific roles in growth factor biosynthesis, suggesting a general role for members of this gene family in the generation of biologically active peptides (Mason, A.J., Evans, B.A., Cox, D.R., Shine, J., and Richards, R.I. (1983) Nature 303, 300-307). Here we describe the identification, structure, and expression of the renal kallikrein gene, the major kinin-generating member of the family. Kinins are potent vasodilators implicated in regulation of local blood flow and ion transport. A gene-specific oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe was designed and chemically synthesized from the renal kallikrein gene sequence to distinguish this gene's transcripts from those of other members of the gene family. Differential expression phenotypes were found between the renal kallikrein gene and other members of the kallikrein gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1534019559,"Murine lymphoma cell lines such as WEHI-7 exhibit a cytolytic response to both cAMP and glucocorticoids. We have exploited this behavior to ask if cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase plays a role in regulating glucocorticoid receptor function. We have found that cAMP-resistant cell lines containing a defective cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity give rise to spontaneous steroid-resistant variants at a high frequency (approximately 10(-7)) relative to wild type cells (less than 10(-10)). Unlike previous results with wild type cells, nearly complete loss of glucocorticoid receptor function was observed in a single selection using unmutagenized cAMPr derivatives of WEHI-7. Thus, the initial selection of the cAMPr phenotype serves as a permissive step toward the acquisition of glucocorticoid resistance in WEHI-7. In addition, cAMP was found to increase the levels of steroid binding in these cell lines, and the dose response was dependent upon the phenotype of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The results demonstrate an important role for cAMP in regulating glucocorticoid receptor activity and strongly suggest that this novel two-step selection scheme leads to the isolation of new forms of glucocorticoid resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2168241361,"Incubation of HeLa cell cultures with human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) increased the binding of radioiodinated human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to specific cell surface receptors (TNF-R). IFN-gamma also produced a proportionate increase in receptor-mediated endocytosis of TNF. TNF-R expression was significantly increased after 6 h of exposure to IFN-gamma (100 units/ml), and it remained elevated in the continuous presence of IFN-gamma for at least 20 h. Incubation of cells with IFN-gamma in the presence of cycloheximide, followed by treatment with actinomycin D and reversal of the inhibition of protein synthesis, also resulted in increased TNF-R expression as compared to cultures subjected to the same treatments in the absence of IFN-gamma. These results suggest that IFN-gamma can directly stimulate accumulation of the mRNA for TNF-R and that TNF-R is among the cellular proteins whose synthesis is increased by IFN-gamma."
https://openalex.org/W2148381482,"Bovine adrenal chromaffin cells possess both nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors, but only nicotinic receptors have heretofore appeared to mediate Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. We have now found that muscarinic receptor stimulation in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells leads to enhanced inositol phospholipid metabolism as evidenced by the rapid (less than 1 min) formation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and inositol bisphosphate (IP2). Muscarinic receptor-mediated accumulation of IP3 and IP2 continues beyond 1 min in the presence of LiCl and is accompanied by large increases in inositol monophosphate. Muscarinic receptor stimulation was also found to enhance nicotine-induced catecholamine secretion by 1.7-fold if muscarine was added 30 s before nicotine addition. Moreover, since the muscarinic antagonist atropine reduces acetylcholine-induced secretion, we conclude that muscarinic receptor stimulation somehow primes these cells for nicotinic receptor-mediated secretion, perhaps by causing small nonstimulatory increases in cytosolic free Ca2+ mediated by IP3. Furthermore, we show that small depolarizations of these cells with 10 mM K+, which themselves do not affect basal secretion, also enhance nicotine-induced secretion. Thus, small increases in cytosolic free Ca2+ produced either by physiologic muscarinic receptor stimulation or by small experimental depolarizations with K+ may prime the chromaffin cells for nicotinic receptor-mediated secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1531067990,"Isolated rat heptocytes were found to metabolize leukotriene B4 (LTB4) to a number of products which could be separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). After incubation of LTB4 with hepatocytes for 15 min, the known omega-oxidized metabolites, 20-hydroxy- and 20-carboxy-LTB4, were identified by HPLC retention time and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. An early fraction corresponding to 15% of the initial LTB4 was structurally characterized as a novel metabolite, 18-carboxy-19,20-dinor-LTB4, by ultraviolet spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the derivatized and derivatized, reduced metabolite. The short HPLC retention time of this metabolite was consistent with its reduced lipophilicity. An additional minor metabolite was tentatively identified as 3-hydroxy-LTB4. These two novel metabolites provide evidence for beta-oxidation as an important route of hepatic biotransformation of LTB4 and 20-hydroxy-LTB4."
https://openalex.org/W1607722677,"The bacteriophage T4 uvsX gene is a nonessential gene required for normal levels of DNA repair, recombination, and replication. We demonstrate that plasmids containing the T4 DNA approximately 300-2900 base pairs upstream of T4 gene 41 express a biologically active uvsX protein. This uvsX protein imparts increased survival to UV-irradiated T4 uvsX- phage and decreases the T4 uvsX- mutant suppression of a conditionally lethal T4 mutant in the gene 49 recombination nuclease. The uvsX protein purified from cells with a uvsX+ plasmid catalyzes ATP hydrolysis to ADP and AMP and, in the presence of the T4 gene 32 helix-destablizing protein, ATP-dependent strand exchange between homologous circular single-stranded and linear duplex DNA. These results agree with the recent characterization of uvsX protein from T4-infected cells by Yonesaki et al. (Yonesaki, T., Ryo, Y., Minagawa, T., and Takahashi, H. (1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 148, 127-134) and by Formosa and Alberts (Formosa, T., and Alberts, B.M. (1984) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 49, 363-370). In addition, we find that under some reaction conditions strand exchange is catalyzed by uvsX protein in the absence of 32 protein. The level of the uvsX protein expressed by the uvsX+ plasmids is high and independent of the orientation of the T4 DNA within the vector. This suggests that transcription promoter(s) lie upstream of the uvsX gene on the cloned T4 DNA. In vitro transcription of T4 DNA restriction fragments reveals two tandem promoters whose transcripts initiate approximately 500 and 600 nucleotides upstream of the uvsX gene and extend through the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1503877672,"The oxidation of glutathione to a thiyl radical by prostaglandin H synthase was investigated. Ram seminal vesicle microsomes, in the presence of arachidonic acid, oxidized glutathione to its thiyl-free radical metabolite, which was detected by ESR using the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide. Oxidation of glutathione was dependent on arachidonic acid and inhibited by indomethacin. Peroxides also supported oxidation, indicating that the oxidation was by prostaglandin hydroperoxidase. Glutathione served as a reducingcofactor for the reduction of 15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid to 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid at 1.5-2 times the nonenzymatic rate. Although purified prostaglandin H synthase in the presence of either H2O2 or 15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid oxidized glutathione to a thiyl radical, arachidonic acid did not support glutathione oxidation. Glutathione also inhibited cyclooxygenase activity as determined by measuring oxygen incorporation into arachidonic acid. Reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of the arachidonic acid metabolites indicated that the presence of glutathione in an incubation altered the metabolite profile. In the absence of the cofactor, the metabolites were PGD2, PGE2, and 15-hydroperoxy-PGE2 (where PG indicates prostaglandin), while in the presence of glutathione, the only metabolite was PGE2. These results indicate that glutathione not only serves as a cofactor for prostaglandin E isomerase but is also a reducing cofactor for prostaglandin H hydroperoxidase. Assuming that glutathione thiyl-free radical observed in the trapping experiments is involved in the enzymatic reduction of 15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid to 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid, then a 1-electron donation from glutathione to prostaglandin hydroperoxidase is indicated."
https://openalex.org/W1551801637,"Rabbit antisera were raised against diacylglycerol kinase purified from pig brain cytosol. Upon immunoblot analysis, the antibody was specifically reactive with the kinase (Mr = 79,000-80,000). Pig brain cytosol, microsomal, and synaptosomal fractions all contained the immunoreactive Mr = 80,000 polypeptide, thus showing that the same enzyme is present in the soluble as well as membrane fractions of the brain. The antibody could precipitate only 60% of the kinase activity present in the crude cytosol. Further, the antibody exhibited very little or no cross-reactivity toward liver cytosolic enzymes obtained from different animals including pigs. Immunostaining of brain tissues demonstrated that neurons, in particular, their nuclei, were positively stained, whereas glial cells were not stained. It is likely that there exists a tissue-and/or cell-dependent immunological multiplicity of diacylglycerol kinase. The enzyme activities phosphorylating sn-1 and sn-2 monoacylglycerols were co-precipitated by the antibody, indicating their identity with diacylglycerol kinase. The enzyme activity toward sn-1 monoolein was much lower than that obtained with sn-2 monoolein. Enzymic as well as chemical analyses of acyl isomers of the reaction products showed that even tested with pure (greater than 95%) sn-1 monoolein, about 70% of the formed lysophosphatidate was of the sn-2 acyl type. The results show that diacylglycerol kinase phosphorylates almost exclusively the sn-2 acyl type of monoacyl-glycerol."
https://openalex.org/W1554481731,"Purified phospholamban isolated from canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was subjected to proteolysis and peptide mapping to localize the different sites of phosphorylation on the protein and to gain further information on its subunit structure. Five different proteases (trypsin, papain, chymotrypsin, elastase, and Pronase) degraded the oligomeric 27-kDa phosphoprotein into a major 21-22-kDa protease-resistant fragment. No 32P was retained by this protease-resistant fragment, regardless of whether phospholamban had been phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, or protein kinase C. Phosphoamino acid analysis and thin-layer electrophoresis of liberated phosphopeptides revealed that 1 threonine and 2 serine residues were phosphorylated in phospholamban and that 1 of these serine residues and the threonine residue were in close proximity. Only serine was phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, whereas Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphorylated exclusively threonine. The results demonstrate that phospholamban has a large protease-resistant domain and a smaller protease-sensitive domain, the latter of which contains all of the sites of phosphorylation. The 21-22-kDa protease-resistant domain, although devoid of incorporated 32P, was completely dissociated into identical lower molecular weight subunits by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate, suggesting that this region of the molecule promotes the relatively strong interactions that hold the subunits together. The data presented lend further support for a model of phospholamban structure in which several identical low molecular weight subunits are noncovalently bound to one another, each containing one site of phosphorylation for cAMP-dependent protein kinase and another site of phosphorylation for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1495556880,"Rat pancreatic islets demonstrate inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphomonoesterase activity which is 3 times higher than that in the exocrine pancreas. This enzyme has several features in common with the erythrocyte and hepatocyte enzymes: it is located primarily in the plasma membrane, it has a similar Km for inositol trisphosphate (IP3) (16 microM), and it requires Mg2+. The activity of the islet enzyme is inhibited by several diphosphorylated glucose metabolites: 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. Monophosphorylated and unphosphorylated metabolites have little or no effect on its activity. Several reports show that stimulation of islets with glucose raises the concentrations of various glucose metabolites including fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate to concentrations that are in the range that inhibit the islet inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphomonoesterase. Other reports show that IP3 mobilizes calcium when added to permeabilized insulin-secreting cells. It is possible that the increase in cytosolic calcium known to occur during glucose-induced insulin secretion may be sustained in part by higher IP3 levels resulting from the inhibition of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphomonoesterase by some of the diphosphorylated glucose metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W1481950549,"We have used polysomal immunoabsorption techniques to purify rat liver quinone reductase mRNA (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.99.2, formerly called DT-diaphorase). Using the purified mRNA as template, cDNA clones complementary to quinone reductase mRNA have been constructed. One cDNA clone, pDTD55, has a 1900-base pair insert which has been demonstrated by hybrid-select translation experiments to be complementary to quinone reductase mRNA. Clone pDTD55 has been used in RNA and DNA blot hybridizations to show that quinone reductase mRNA is approximately 1900 nucleotides in length and is encoded by a gene which spans approximately 7000-8000 base pairs. We have also shown that quinone reductase mRNA is markedly elevated by 3-methylcholanthrene administration and in persistent hepatocyte nodules induced by chemical carcinogens. The elevation of quinone reductase mRNA in persistent hepatocyte nodules is not due to either gene amplification of DNA rearrangement. Rather, the quinone reductase gene is hypomethylated in persistent hepatocyte nodules compared to the gene in either liver tissue surrounding the nodule or normal liver. These data suggest that hypomethylation of specific gene sequences occurs at early stages during chemical carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1616057082,"The 2',3'-dialdehyde derivative of NADPH was used as an affinity labeling reagent of a solubilized NADPH-dependent superoxide-generating oxidase preparation of pig neutrophils. The analogue served as both an electron donor and a competitive inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase against NADPH. The apparent Michaelis constant (Km) for the derivative (31 microM) was essentially the same as that for NADPH (33 microM). The activity of the superoxide formation in the presence of 2',3'-dialdehyde NADPH was about a half of that in the presence of NADPH. Incubation of the enzyme with the derivative inactivated the superoxide-generating activity and the inactivation was prevented by the addition of NADPH. We performed the labeling of the oxidase preparation with 2',3'-dialdehyde NADPH and sodium cyanoboro[3H]hydride, based on the above results. A protein of 66,000 daltons was selectively labeled among more than 20 bands in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis which were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The protein was not labeled when the oxidase preparation was pretreated with p-chloromercuribenzoate or it was labeled in the presence of excess NADPH. The protein is suggested to be the NADPH binding component of the neutrophil superoxide-generating oxidase system."
https://openalex.org/W1593074195,"Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) was labeled with sodium [125I]iodide using the chloramine-T method and subsequently purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Three main 125I-labeled peaks designated A, B, and C resulted from the radioiodination and purification procedures. They were characterized by electrophoresis of tryptic fragments; Edman degradation (for Peaks A and C); enzymatic digestion to amino acids by leucine aminopeptidase, carboxypeptidase Y and Pronase; and treatment with cyanogen bromide. Peak A corresponds to VIP monoiodinated on Tyr10 and with the Met17 residue oxidized to methionine sulfoxide. This [mono[125I]iodo-Tyr10,MetO17]VIP displays the following characteristics. 1) It constitutes quantitatively the major product of the iodination procedure (62.5%); 2) it is well resolved from other labeled and unlabeled products; 3) it is stable (2 months at -20 degrees C); 4) it possesses a high specific activity (2050 Ci/mmol); 5) it maintains the biological activity of native VIP; and 6) it binds to antibody and membrane recognition sites in a specific, saturable, and reversible manner. Reduction of [mono[125I]iodo-Tyr10, Met-O17]VIP to [mono[125I]iodo-Tyr10]VIP does not improve the performance of the tracer in a radioimmunoassay. The method described in this article is simple and rapid and yields a molecular form of 125I-labeled VIP that has been fully characterized and is suitable for use in biological studies."
https://openalex.org/W1525258216,"Apolipoprotein (apo) A-I is the principal protein component of high density lipoproteins and the major in vivo activator of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase. We have used the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, as a model to examine the ability of estrogen to modulate hepatic synthesis of apo-A-I. Primer extension studies have demonstrated that the major transcriptional initiation site of the apo-A-I gene utilized in the hepatoma cells is the same as that used in human liver. The kinetics of induction of high- and low-affinity estrogen-binding sites, rates of secretion of apolipoproteins, and apo-A-I mRNA levels were examined following treatment of the cells with estrogen. Initial concentrations of 20 nM 17 beta-estradiol resulted in a 14-15-fold increase in the levels of high-affinity nuclear estrogen-binding sites within 8 h, while the level of low-affinity sites increased by only 10%. During the same period, the levels of apo-A-I mRNA and the rate of accumulation of the secreted protein increased by 55 and 50%, respectively. New steady state levels of apo-A-I mRNA and rates of accumulation of protein, approximately twice those in control cultures, were established within 24-48 h of exposure to hormone. Experiments with a 50-fold higher concentration of estrogen resulted in only an additional 10% increase in mRNA levels. The increase in mRNA levels following estrogen treatment was adequate to account for 85-90% of the elevation observed in the rate of accumulation of secreted apo-A-I. Comparison of the apo-A-I mRNA levels in HepG2 cells with those present in human liver revealed that the concentration of the mRNA was approximately 3-fold lower than that found in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1574916849,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) increases rapidly two potential intracellular signals, inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and free cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i), for stimulated prolactin release and synthesis in GH4C1 rat pituitary cells. We have examined the temporal relationships between TRH-enhanced formation of inositol phosphates and TRH-elevated [Ca2+]i. TRH-enhanced IP3 content was closely paralleled by the initial phase of TRH-elevated [Ca2+]i. To investigate receptor-effector coupling for these rapid actions of TRH, we examined their dependence on receptor number in five GH4C1 variant strains containing 0-2.6 X 10(5) receptor sites/cell. We found that receptor number (up to 1.7 X 10(5)/cell) was limiting for TRH-enhanced IP3 formation as well as for both the initial burst and plateau phases of TRH-elevated [Ca2+]i. The ED50 for rapid (5 s) TRH-stimulated IP3 formation was higher than for other sustained TRH actions in these cells, and we postulated that the initial TRH receptor interactions occur with rapid dissociation kinetics. To test this hypothesis, we performed rapid dilution experiments following a 1-s stimulation and found that TRH-stimulated IP3 formation decreased within 4 s of dilution and disappeared within 60 s at which time fresh TRH could restimulate IP3 formation. We conclude that receptor occupancy is the limiting step for TRH-stimulated IP3 formation and elevated [Ca2+]i and that maximal TRH action requires multiple rapid interactions between TRH and its receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1571820966,"Na+-dependent Ca2+ efflux was demonstrated in cells isolated from the rat renal cortex, suggestive of the presence of a Na+/Ca2+ exchange carrier in the cells. Parathyroid hormone, when incubated with the cells in vitro, increased Na+-dependent Ca2+ efflux about 60%. The effect of the hormone was specific for biologically active parathyroid hormone analogs and could be mimicked by cyclic nucleotides and forskolin. The effects of parathyroid hormone concentration on Ca2+ efflux and cyclic AMP formation were similar. These findings would be consistent with the view that the cyclic nucleotide might act as the intracellular messenger to increase Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity. Cells isolated from parathyroidectomized rats had decreased Na+-dependent Ca2+ efflux. When these cells were treated in vitro with parathyroid hormone, Na+-dependent Ca2+ efflux was enhanced to the same rate as found with cells from sham-operated animals. Parathyroid hormone-sensitive Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity was markedly blunted in cells from senescent (24 months) rats. Basal Na+-dependent Ca2+ efflux and Na+-independent Ca2+ efflux were not altered in the aged animal. Parathyroid-stimulated adenylate cyclase was also decreased in aging. In contrast, forskolin-stimulated Na+-dependent Ca2+ efflux and adenylate cyclase did not change with senescence. These findings would be compatible with a mechanism of desensitization that occurred at the level of the receptor or hormone-receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase. These results may be of physiological significance in understanding calcium homeostasis and the imbalances in mineral metabolism associated with old age."

In vitro translation of mRNA isolated from evaginating discs shows accumulation of at least five new mRNA transcripts that are present only in membrane-bound polysomal RNA and presumably encode imaginal disc membrane or secreted proteins. Using a modified differential hybridization screen employing a competition step, six different hormone-inducible membrane protein gene sequences were isolated. These genes constitute a new set of 20-hydroxyecdysone responsive loci that may encode gene products specifically required for imaginal disc morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1527634737,"Homogeneous catalytic subunit from the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, when derivatized with a fluorophore, was used as a cytochemical probe to locate intracellular sites of the protein kinase regulatory subunit. After conjugation, the fluoresceinated catalytic subunit (F:C), derivatized to a stoichiometry of approximately 1 mol/mol, retained near full activity as judged by specific activity and by titration against either regulatory subunit or Inhibitor Protein of the protein kinase. With this molecular probe the dissociated regulatory subunit was localized by direct cytochemistry in Reuber H-35 hepatoma cells that had been exposed, while intact, for 0-120 min to 10(-4) M 8-Br-cAMP. After stimulation, cultures were fixed and washed and then incubated for 16 h with F:C. Following 8-Br-cAMP stimulation, extensive binding of the probe to both cytoplasmic and nucleolar sites was observed. This binding was diminished but not eliminated when 50 microM cAMP was present during the incubation of the fixed cells with F:C that was eliminated by a 40-fold molar excess of underivatized catalytic subunit but not by heat-denatured catalytic subunit, and was not reduced by a 20-fold molar excess of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, examined plus or minus cGMP. Collectively, the results allow the conclusion that the F:C probe binds free regulatory subunit. The time course of its change with 8-Br-cAMP (measured as the difference between binding in the presence or absence of cAMP during the postfixation treatment) mirrors that previously reported for changes in the catalytic subunit in these cells, also identified cytochemically (Byus, C. V., and Fletcher, W.H. (1982) J. Cell Biol. 93, 727-734). The binding of the F:C probe, detected when cAMP is present during postfixation treatment, may possibly represent binding to free Inhibitor Protein of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. If so, it was at a level of approximately 20% of the maximal level of detectable regulatory subunit, and it also showed cytosolic and nucleolar localization."
https://openalex.org/W1532857324,"The mouse genome contains a retrovirus-like sequence, designated VL30, which is expressed at high levels in transformed cells and which can be induced by exogenously supplied epidermal growth factor (EGF). Binding of EGF to the EGF receptor produces changes in intracellular calcium levels and phospholipase activity which indirectly lead to activation of protein kinase C. We treated AKR-2B cells, Swiss 3T3 cells, and the 3T3 variants NR6 (EGF receptorless) and TNR9 (phorbol ester nonresponsive) with various phorbol ester tumor promoters and with the synthetic diacylglycerol sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol. Tumor-promoting phorbol esters (e.g. 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA] increased the level of VL30 expression. Stimulation with either TPA or EGF produced a similar time course of VL30 expression. TPA induced VL30 expression in the EGF-receptorless NR6 cell line, indicating that neither EGF ligand-receptor binding nor phosphorylation of the EGF receptor was required for induction of VL30 expression. Protein synthesis was not required for the TPA-mediated increase in VL30 expression, as pretreatment with cycloheximide did not block or reduce the TPA effect. VL30 expression was also stimulated by treatment with sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, an analog of a probable endogenous activator of protein kinase C. These results suggest that activation of protein kinase C plays a direct role in regulating VL30 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1538214559,"The structures of O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides present in the heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans isolated from the culture medium of a normal (HBL-100) and a malignant (MDA-MB-231) human mammary epithelial cell line have been determined. Both proteoglycan types from the two cell lines contain a series of O-linked oligosaccharides ranging in size from di- to hexasaccharide. Cells were grown in the presence of either [3H]glucosamine or [3H]galactose and Na2 35SO4, and the proteoglycans were isolated as described (Gowda, D. C., Bhavanandan, V. P., and Davidson, E. A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4926-4934). The O-linked oligosaccharides were released from the proteoglycans by alkaline borohydride treatment and purified by a combination of gel filtration and high voltage paper electrophoresis. The structures of two neutral and seven acidic oligosaccharides were established based on sugar composition, the results of periodate oxidation, sequential exoglycosidase treatment, and methylation analysis. Periodate oxidation, taking advantage of tritium label at specific positions of constituent sugars, proved to be a valuable tool in establishing the structure of isomeric components in the mixture. The structures of the oligosaccharides were assigned as follows: (Formula: see text) The oligosaccharide containing both sialic acid and ester sulfate is novel and has not been reported previously."
https://openalex.org/W1595270287,"The type I topoisomerase from rat cells produces true catenanes from circular SV40 DNA in a reaction which is dependent on the presence of a single-strand break in at least one member of a pair of reacting molecules. The role of the single-strand break in the reaction was examined. Molecules containing a nick with a 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphate or a nick with a 3'-phosphate and 5'-hydroxyl and molecules with single-stranded gaps were all found to be equally effective in the catenation reaction. It was found that the enzyme could, at a low frequency, break DNA by acting opposite a pre-existing single-strand break. Thus, incubation of nicked circular DNA in the presence of the topoisomerase, polynucleotide kinase, and [gamma-32P]ATP led to the production of a low level of labeled linear molecules containing covalently attached protein. Nicked linear molecules treated with topoisomerase in the absence of polynucleotide kinase generated fragments of sizes consistent with breakage in the opposite strand near the pre-existing nick. Based on these results, we propose that the catenation reaction may involve the transient production of linear intermediates by the action of the topoisomerase opposite a pre-existing nick in the DNA. Rejoining of the two ends by the enzyme could lead to the interlocking of two or more circular DNAs. In addition, these results suggest a possible role for the type I topoisomerase in illegitimate recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2139610312,"Two inactive/latent protein phosphatases termed LP-1 (Mr 260,000) and LP-2 (Mr 350,000) were identified and purified from pig brain. Examination of molecular structures indicated that LP-1 has three subunits with molecular weights of 69,000, 55,000, and 34,000, respectively, whereas LP-2 contains only one subunit, with molecular weight of 49,000. When using phosphorylase a as a substrate, LP-1 was completely inactive and could be dramatically activated by freezing and thawing in 0.2 M 2-mercaptoethanol, whereas LP-2 contained some basal activity but could also be stimulated 40-fold by the same treatment. Kinetic analysis further indicated that both LP-1 and LP-2 enzymes dephosphorylate histone 2A, myelin basic protein, and phosphorylase a at a rather comparable rate, but the dephosphorylation of histone 2A and myelin basic protein seems to be spontaneously active. This, together with the results that trypsinolysis could specifically knock off phosphorylase phosphatase activity but caused no effect on the associated myelin basic protein/histone phosphatase activities, supports the notion that a two-site mechanism may possibly be involved in the regulation of substrate specificity of LP-1 and LP-2 enzymes in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1508268001,"The photoaffinity probe [125I]aryl azidoprazosin was used to examine structural aspects of rat left ventricular alpha 1-adrenergic receptor. Autoradiography of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-resolved proteins from photoaffinity-labeled membranes revealed a specifically labeled protein of mass 77 kDa. Adrenergic drugs competed with the photoaffinity probe for binding to the receptor in a manner expected of an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist. Because the autoradiographic pattern was unaltered by incubating labeled membranes in gel sample buffer containing high concentrations of reducing agents, the binding component of the cardiac alpha 1-adrenergic receptor appears to be a single polypeptide chain. The photoaffinity probe specifically labeled a single protein of approximately 68 kDa in membranes of cardiac myocytes prepared from rat left ventricles. The role played by sulfhydryls in receptor structure and function was also studied. Dithiothreitol (DTT) inhibited [3H]prazosin binding to left ventricular membranes and altered both the equilibrium dissociation constant and maximal number of [3H]prazosin-binding sites but not the ability of the guanine nucleotide guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate to decrease agonist affinity for the receptors. When photoaffinity-labeled membranes were incubated with 40 mM DTT for 30 min at room temperature, two specifically labeled proteins of 77 and 68 kDa were identified. The DTT-induced conversion of the 77-kDa protein to 68 kDa was irreversible with washing, but the effect of DTT on [3H]prazosin binding was reversible. Both 77- and 68-kDa proteins were observed with liver membranes even in the absence of reducing agent. We suggest that the DTT-induced conversion of the 77-kDa protein to 68 kDa is due to enhancement in protease activity by the reductant. These results document that the cardiac alpha 1-adrenergic receptor is a 77-kDa protein, similar in mass to the receptor in liver and other sites. Proteolysis likely accounts for lower Mr forms of this receptor found in cardiac myocytes and in previous publications on hepatic alpha 1-receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1544228402,"To study the biosynthesis of rabbit C-reactive protein (CRP), a cDNA library was constructed from CRP mRNA-enriched polysomal poly(A) RNA. Four recombinant plasmids, designated pCX9, pCX23, pCX28, and pCX39, from 39 positive clones were sequenced and found to represent overlapping clones. DNA sequencing of CRP cDNA and primer extension of the 5'-end of CRP mRNA have demonstrated that the complete length of rabbit CRP mRNA consists of 2331 nucleotides and a terminal poly(A) segment. Analysis of the resulting sequence indicated that rabbit CRP mRNA contained a 5'-noncoding region of 107 nucleotides, a leader sequence encoding 20 amino acids, a coding region covering 205 amino acids, and a 3'-noncoding region of 1549 nucleotides. The 3'-noncoding region contained a consensus AAUAAA sequence that is 105 nucleotides upstream from the 3'-terminal poly(A) segment. Using an in vitro translation system, we have confirmed that CRP is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide (Mr approximately equal to 26,000) which undergoes processing to form the mature polypeptide (Mr approximately equal to 23,500). The CRP precursor failed to display a calcium-dependent affinity for phosphorylcholine ligand as demonstrated by mature CRP, suggesting that the phosphorylcholine-binding site of CRP only formed after processing. Northern blot analysis suggested that following induction with turpentine, liver was the only site where CRP mRNA synthesis could be demonstrated and that the change in mRNA concentration correlated with the course of CRP production. Southern blot analysis of liver genomic DNA indicated a single gene copy for CRP."
https://openalex.org/W1529832591,"Pretreatment of articular cartilage with a highly purified collagenase in the presence of selected protease inhibitors allowed the extraction under nondissociative conditions of 65% of the tissue hexuronate. Extracted proteoglycans were purified by two successive equilibrium centrifugations in Cs2SO4 and CsCl, respectively, and then characterized by their sedimentation properties. The use of labeled proteoglycan preparations demonstrated that no detectable degradation was introduced by the new extraction procedure. When applied to growth cartilage of rachitic rats the sedimentation profile of the purified proteoglycans was practically identical to that of the proteoglycan molecules recovered by micropuncture-aspiration. Proteoglycans were extracted from normal articular cartilage of rabbits and dogs with either the new procedure or 4.0 M guanidine HCl. The purified aA1 and A1 preparations were characterized by their sedimentation properties. The aA1 contained a higher proportion of aggregates which sedimented as two distinctive populations of molecules. This bimodal distribution of the aggregates was never observed in the A1 preparations even when the dissociative extraction was performed after collagenase pretreatment of cartilages. The two extraction procedures, however, extracted the same proteoglycan monomers since the aA1-D1 and A1-D1 preparations had similar biochemical composition and g(s) distribution functions. These observations and additional in vitro aggregation studies suggested that the differences in the size and proportion of aggregates between the aA1 and A1 preparations result from a more efficient recovery of link glycoproteins in nondissociative extractions that could have determined two structurally different hyaluronate molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1526039940,"We have determined the DNA sequence of the oxi-3 gene and its 5' flanking region in the extranuclear [mi-3] mutant of Neurospora crassa. The oxi-3 gene encodes subunit 1 of cytochrome c oxidase, a protein known to be altered in the [mi-3] mutant (Bertrand, H., and Werner, S. (1979) Eur. J. Biochem. 98, 9-18). When the sequence from [mi-3] was compared to previously published sequences of the same region of mtDNA from wild-type N. crassa, a total of five differences was found. Four of these differences can be accounted for as either genetic polymorphisms or previous errors in DNA sequence determination. The remaining difference is a G/C to T/A transversion that changes a codon specifying an aspartic acid residue (GAC) to one that would specify tyrosine (TAC) at amino acid 448 of the 555 amino acid mature subunit 1 protein. This alteration was also found in the mtDNA of two separate heterokaryotic strains that had acquired the [mi-3] phenotype after repeated subculturing of heterokaryons forced between an [mi-3] strain and a strain containing a wild-type cytoplasm. The particular aspartic acid residue that would be affected by the mutation observed in [mi-3] is conserved in a diversity of species as either aspartic acid or glutamic acid, suggesting that an acidic residue at this position is important for the correct function of the subunit 1 protein. For these reasons, we consider it likely that the observed missense mutation is responsible for the [mi-3] phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1538069012,"The isolated glycogen particle provides a means to examine the regulation of glycogen metabolism with the components organized in a functional cellular complex. With this system, we have studied the control of phosphorylase kinase activation by Ca2+ and cAMP. Contrary to a previous report (Heilmeyer, L. M. G., Jr., Meyer, F., Haschke, R. H., and Fisher, E. H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 6649-6656), phosphorylase kinase became activated during incubation of the glycogen particle with MgATP2- and Ca2+. Part of this activation could be attributed to the action of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase; however, it was not possible to quantitatively correlate activation with phosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ due to a large, but uncertain, contribution of synergistic activation caused by these ions. This latter activation had properties similar to those described by King and Carlson (King, M. M., and Carlson, G. M. (1980) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 209, 517-523) with the purified enzyme, and its occurrence also explains why phosphorylase kinase activation in the glycogen particle was not observed previously. The cAMP-dependent activation of phosphorylase kinase in the glycogen particle has been characterized. It occurred in a similar manner when either the cAMP-dependent protein kinase or cAMP was added, thus indicating that the phosphorylation sites of phosphorylase kinase complexed in the glycogen particle were accessible to endogenous or exogenous enzyme. In the glycogen particle, both the alpha and beta subunits were phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, but the alpha subunit dephosphorylation appeared to be preferentially regulated by Ca2+. The activity of phosphorylase kinase in the glycogen particle is regulated by the phosphorylation of both the alpha and beta subunits."
