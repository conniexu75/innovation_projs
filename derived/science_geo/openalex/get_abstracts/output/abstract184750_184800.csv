The mechanisms regulating Snail expression in development and tumor progression are not yet known. We show here that transforming growth factor β-1 (TGFβ1) induces Snail expression in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transitions by a mechanism dependent on the MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, TGFβ1 induces the activity of Snail promoter, whereas fibroblast growth factor-2 has a milder effect but cooperates with TGFβ1 in the induction of Snail promoter. Interestingly, TGFβ1-mediated induction of Snail promoter is blocked by a dominant negative form of H-Ras (N17Ras), whereas oncogenic H-Ras (V12Ras) induces Snail promoter activity and synergistically cooperates with TGFβ1. The effects of TGFβ1 on Snail promoter are dependent of MEK1/2 activity but are apparently independent of Smad4 activity. In addition, H-Ras-mediated induction of Snail promoter, alone or in the presence of TGFβ1, depends on both MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activities. These data support that MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways are implicated in TGFβ1-mediated induction of Snail promoter, probably through Ras activation and its downstream effectors.

The molecular mechanisms underlying local invasion and metastasis are still poorly understood, but evidence accumulated in the last years indicates the existence of common cellular mechanisms for the local invasive process that represent the first stage into the metastatic cascade of carcinomas (1Hanahan D.

Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Among those, loss of expression or function of the E-cadherin cell-cell adhesion molecule has emerged as an important event for local invasion of epithelial tumor cells, leading to the consideration of E-cadherin as an invasion-suppressor gene (3Berx G.

The process of invasion is frequently associated with the loss of other epithelial markers and the acquisition of mesenchymal markers and a migratory and motility behavior, collectively known as epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) 1The abbreviations used are: EMTs, epithelial-mesenchymal transitions; AP, activator protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RT, reverse transcription; TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; FBS, fetal bovine serum. (see Ref. 6Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5489) Google Scholar for a recent review). EMTs also occur during normal embryonic development in a strict spatio-temporal control, and they are required at specific stages, such as during gastrulation, formation of the neural crest cells, and other morphogenetic processes (6Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5489) Google Scholar, 7Hay E.D. Acta Anat. 1995; 154: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 8Sun D. Baur S. Hay E.D. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These developmental EMTs are always accompanied by the loss of functional E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (9Huber O. Bierkamp C. Kemler R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 10Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying down-regulation of E-cadherin during EMTs and tumor progression are starting to be uncovered. Genetic alterations of the E-cadherin loci have been found in a scarce number of tumors, particularly in lobular breast carcinomas and diffuse gastric carcinomas (3Berx G. Cleton-Jansen A.M.

Nature. 1998; 392: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar), whereas the majority of carcinomas with down-regulated E-cadherin maintain an intact E-cadherin locus. Hypermethylation of the E-cadherin promoter and transcriptional alterations have emerged as the main mechanisms responsible for E-cadherin down-regulation in most carcinomas (5Christofori G. Semb H.

Several transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin have been isolated recently, including the zinc finger factors Snail (14Cano A. Pérez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G.

Snail family factors are in fact involved in EMTs when overexpressed in epithelial cell lines (14Cano A. Pérez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F.

Biol. 2002; 3: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar), and are proposed to act as inducers of the invasion process (14Cano A. Pérez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A.

Nieto M.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3241-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Generation of Snail knockout mice has further established the role of this factor in EMT and as the E-cadherin gene repressor. The null Snail embryos die at gastrulation as they fail to undergo a complete EMT process, forming an altered mesodermal layer that maintains the expression of E-cadherin (23Carver E.A. Jiang R. Lan Y. Oram K.F. Gridley T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8184-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanisms that regulate the expression of Snail factors are still poorly understood (6Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5489) Google Scholar, 21Nieto M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). Different growth factors and cytokines have also been implicated in the process of EMTs in both epithelial cell systems and in embryonic development. Studies on development have indicated the participation of several members of the transforming growth factor (TGFβ)/bone morphogenetic family of growth factors in specific EMT processes in different species (24Liem Jr., K.F. Tremml G. Roelink H. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 969-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 25Romano L.A. Runyan R.B. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), whereas fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling has been reported recently (26Ciruna B. Rossant J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 37-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) as a determinant for mesoderm cell fate specification in the mouse embryo. Several studies have also indicated that a multiple cross-talk among TGFβ/bone morphogenetics, FGF, and Wnt signals could be required for some EMTs in development (26Ciruna B. Rossant J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 37-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 27Dorsky R.I. Moon R.T. Raible D.W.

In epithelial cell systems, several growth factors have been widely studied and reported to induce a scattering phenotype or a complete EMT depending on the specific cell system analyzed (reviewed in Refs. 6Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5489) Google Scholar and 29Boyer B. Valles A.M. Edme N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Among them, TGFβ has been identified as an important molecular player of EMT both in vitro and in vivo (30Caulín C. Scholl F.G. Frontelo P. Gamallo C. Quintanilla M. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1027-1035PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cui W. Fowlis D.J. Bryson S. Duffie E. Ireland H. Balmain A. Akhurst R.J.

Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 393-404PubMed Google Scholar). In some cell systems, a synergistic cooperation between H-Ras activation and TGFβ signaling appears to be required for induction of a complete EMT (33Oft M. Peli J. Rudaz C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Reichmann E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2462-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 35Gotzmann J. Huber H. Thallinger C. Wolschek M. Jansen B. Schulte-Hermann R. Beug H. Mikulits W. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Recently, TGFβ has been reported to induce the expression of Snail in fetal and in immortalized murine hepatocytes and in human mesothelial cells (37Spagnoli F.M. Cicchini C. Tripodi M. Weiss M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3639-3647PubMed Google Scholar, 38Valdes F. Alvarez A.M. Locascio A. Vega S. Herrera B. Fernandez M. Benito M. Nieto M.A. Fabregat I. Mol.

Med. 2003; 348: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), but whether this is a direct or indirect effect has not yet been established. The participation of specific signaling pathways activated by TGFβ and/or H-Ras activation in EMTs has been analyzed previously with somewhat contradictory results as regard to the specific implication of Smad, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and/or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (36Janda E.

The issue has been unraveled recently (36Janda E. Lehmann K. Killisch I. Jechlinger M. Herzig M. Downward J. Beug H. Grunert S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) in the EpRas model with the implication of MAPK in TGFβ-induced EMT, tumorigenesis, and metastasis, whereas PI3K is involved in cell scattering and resistance to TGF-β induced apoptosis. It remains to be established, however, if the same situation applies to other systems and, more importantly, the identification of the target genes involved in the specific growth factor signaling leading to EMTs. We have used the prototypic epithelial MDCK cells to further analyze the process of EMT induced by TGFβ and FGF. We have previously used this cell system to show that Snail overexpression leads to the full repression of E-cadherin expression and induction of a complete EMT (14Cano A. Pérez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). In the present work we have investigated the ability of TGFβ1 and FGF2 to induce an EMT in MDCK cells and ask whether Snail is a target gene of this process. We present evidence that TGFβ1 treatment induces an EMT process linked to Snail induction in MDCK cells. Analysis of the mouse Snail promoter indicates that it is directly induced by TGFβ1 and that FGF2 and activated H-Ras cooperate with TGFβ1 in induction of the Snail promoter. Our results also indicate that the MAPK and PI3K pathways are involved in the TGFβ1- and H-Ras-mediated induction of Snail promoter. These results strongly support that Snail is a direct target of TGFβ1 and oncogenic H-Ras and open the way for future studies on the molecular mechanisms and targets of EMTs and the invasion process. Cell Culture and Treatments—MDCK-II cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and MCA3D and PDV cells in Ham's F-12 medium, in the presence of 10% FBS, 10 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 32 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 atmosphere. All the transfections and treatments were done in FBS-free culture medium. For the indicated treatments, 10 μg/ml stocks of recombinant TGFβ1 (BioNova Corp.) and 100 μg/ml of FGF2 (Peprotech) were prepared according to manufacturer's instructions and added to the indicated concentrations. The PI3K and MEK1/2 inhibitors, LY294002 and PD98059 (Calbiochem), respectively, were kept as 30–10 mm stocks in Me2SO, which was used as vehicle control in all the inhibitor treatments. RT-PCR Analyses—Total RNA was isolated from the different cell lines, and RT-PCR analyses were carried out as described previously (14Cano A. Pérez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar, 17Bolós V Peinado H. Pérez M oreno M.A. Fraga M.F. Esteller M. Cano A.

Canine PCR products were obtained after 30–35 cycles of amplification with an annealing temperature of 60–65 °C. Primer sequences were as follows: for canine E-cadherin (sequence kindly provided by Y. Chen, Harvard Medical School), forward: 5′-GGAATCCTTGGAGGGATCCTC-3′; reverse: 5′-GTCGTCCTCGC-CACCGCCGTACAT-3′ (amplifies a fragment of 560 bp); for canine Snail, forward: 5′-CCCAAGCCCAGCCGATGAG-3′; reverse: 5′-CTTGGCCACGGAGAGCCC-3′ (amplifies a fragment of 200 bp); and for canine glyceralde-hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward: 5′-TGAAGGTCGGT-GTGAACGGATTTGGC-3′; reverse: 5′-CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′ (amplifies a fragment of 900 bp). 3TP-Lux, E-cadherin, and Snail Promoter Analyses—For 3TP-Lux assays a reporter construct containing the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and TGFβ response elements fused to the Luciferase reporter gene (44Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) was used. The generation of mouse E-cadherin promoter constructs containing -178/+92 sequences in its wild-type or mutant Epal fused to Luciferase has been reported previously (17Bolós V Peinado H. Pérez M oreno M.A. Fraga M.F. Esteller M. Cano A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Generation of full-length mouse Snail promoter construct (-900 bp) has also been described recently (17Bolós V Peinado H. Pérez M oreno M.A. Fraga M.F. Esteller M. Cano A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Deletion constructs of the Snail promoter mutants were obtained by PCR amplification from the full-length -900 bp promoter using appropriate primers containing BamHI and KpnI restriction sites and the corresponding PCR products cloned into the same restriction sites in the pXP1-Luciferase vector. To determine the activity of 3TP-Lux and the Snail promoter 2 × 105 cells grown in 24-well plates were transiently transfected with 200 to 500 ng of the indicated reporter constructs and 20 ng of TK-Renilla construct (Promega) as a control of transfection efficiency. Luciferase and renilla activities were measured using a dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega), and after normalization the results were referred to the wild-type promoter activity detected in mock-transfected cells. Results represent the mean ± S.D. of at least two independent experiments performed in duplicate samples. For the cotransfection experiments 500 ng of the following plasmids were used: pSmad4 DN (1–514) in pCMV5 vector (provided by J. Massagué, Sloan-Kettering Memorial Cancer Center) (44Lagna G. Hata A.

For F-actin stain, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature, stained with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) and washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were mounted on Mowiol, and the preparations were visualized using a Leica confocal TCS SP2 microscope. For Western blot, whole cell extracts of control and treated cells were obtained in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and analyzed for the indicated molecules by Western blot and enhanced chemiluminescence detection as described previously (14Cano A.

For cell signaling analysis, Western blots were carried out on cell extracts obtained by lysis in Buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol), containing the appropriate protease and phosphatase inhibitors, during 30 min. at 4 °C. Primary antisera included goat anti-AKT (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-phospho (Ser-473)-AKT (1:500), rabbit anti-ERK1/2 and anti-phospho (Thr-202/Tyr-204)-ERK1/2 (1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology), and rabbit anti-Smad2/3 and rabbit anti-phospho (Ser-465/Ser-467)-Smad2/3 (1:500) (Upstate Biotechnology). Secondary antibodies were BODIPY-conjugated goat anti-rat, anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse (1:1000) (Amersham Biosciences), donkey anti-goat (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), goat anti-rat (1:10,000) (Pierce), and goat anti-rabbit (1:4000) (Nordic) IgG. Cell Proliferation Assays—The indicated number of cells (2.5 × 105 or 5 × 105) were seeded in triplicate samples in 92 plates and grown in complete medium for 3 h. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) in FBS-free medium was added, and the cells were grown for an additional 24 h. [3H]Thymidine was added during the last 5 h of treatment. The cells were collected using a cell harvester device, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined in a scintillation counter. The values, representing the mean ± S.D., were normalized to those obtained in control untreated cells. Migration Assays—The migratory/motility behavior of MDCK cells was analyzed in in vitro wound healing assays as described previously (14Cano A. Pérez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A.

Monolayers of confluent cultures were lightly scratched with a Gilson pipette tip and, after washing to remove detached cells, treated with TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) and/or PD98059 (10 μm), as indicated. Cultures were observed at timely intervals for up to 36 h post-incision. TGFβ1 Induces Cell Scattering and Increased Motility in MDCK Cells Dependent on MEK1/2 Activity—Some previous studies have related the TGFβ/bone morphogenetic signaling pathway to the regulation of EMT both during embryonic development (24Liem Jr., K.F.

To get further insights into the regulation of EMT by both kinds of growth factors, we choose the prototypic epithelial MDCK cell line. Twenty-four h of treatment with TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) (Fig. 1A, b) or a combination of TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) and FGF2 (100 ng/ml) (Fig. 1A, c) induced a dramatic change of the cellular phenotype; MDCK cells became dissociated with reduced cell-cell contacts and acquired a more spindle phenotype. Lower concentrations of TGFβ1 (1–5 ng) induced a milder effect, and treatment with FGF2 alone did not affect the phenotype of MDCK cells (data not shown). The phenotypic changes induced by TGFβ1 were also associated to increased cell motility, as ascertained by in vitro wound healing assays (Fig. 1B). Eight h after incision of the wound, MDCK cells growing in the presence of TGFβ1 started to colonize the wound surface, whereas control untreated cells hardly started to migrate (data not shown). The differences in cell motility were evident 24 h after incision when TGFβ1-treated cells colonized about 70–80% of the wound surface in a random fashion (Fig. 1B, g), in contrast to untreated cells that had only colonized 20–30% of the wound surface by unidirectional migration (Fig. 1B, e). The increased motility induced by TGFβ1 treatment is not because of increased cell proliferation. Analysis of [3H]thymidine incorporation showed that MDCK cells treated with TGFβ1 exhibited an 80% reduction of their proliferation potential, as compared with control untreated cells (Fig. 2A). After 3–4 days of TGFβ1 treatment MDCK cells started to show signs of apoptosis, and most cells died after 7 days of treatment (data not shown). The sensitivity of MDCK cells to TGFβ1 was also evidenced by the quick induction of the responsive 3TP-Lux promoter in the presence of the growth factor (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2TGFβ1 treatment induces proliferation arrest and transcriptional responses in MDCK cells.A, [3H]thymidine incorporation"

Accumulating evidence suggests that the Nephrin-associated protein complex is a signaling nexus. As such, Nephrin-dependent signaling might be mediated in part through Nephrin phosphorylation. Described are biochemical and mouse genetics experiments demonstrating that membrane-associated Nephrin is tyrosine-phosphorylated by the Src family kinase Fyn. Nephrin fractionated in detergent-resistant glomerular membrane fractions with Fyn and Yes. Fyn directly bound Nephrin via its SH3 domain, and Fyn directly phosphorylated Nephrin. Glomeruli in which Fyn, Yes, or Fyn and Yes were genetically deleted in mice were characterized to explore the relationship between these kinases and Nephrin. Fyn deletion resulted in coarsening of podocyte foot processes and marked attenuation of Nephrin phosphorylation in isolated glomerular detergent-resistant membrane fractions. Yes deletion had no identifiable effect on podocyte morphology but dramatically increased Nephrin phosphorylating activity. Similar to Fyn deletion, simultaneous deletion of Fyn and Yes reduced Nephrin phosphorylating activity. These results demonstrate that endogenous Fyn catalyzes Nephrin phosphorylation in podocyte detergent-resistant membrane fractions. Although Yes appears to effect the regulation of Nephrin phosphorylation, the mechanism by which this occurs requires investigation.

A revision of this figure is shown below. In Fig. 5, A, and B, the labels GST-FynSH2 and GST-FynSH3 were reversed. As a result, the conclusion reached in the text on page 20719 (second full paragraph) is incorrect. It should properly read: “In these experiments, Fyn SH2 domain but not its SH3 domain interacted with Nephrin obtained from COS7 cells pretreated with pervanadate (Fig. 5A).... In similar pull-down experiments, GST-Fyn SH2 but not Fyn SH3 interacted with Nephrin obtained from lysates of isolated glomeruli (Fig. Full-Text PDF Open Access Diseases of the renal glomerulus that result in the nephrotic syndrome are important causes of morbidity and mortality affecting both adults and children. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms governing development of the nephrotic syndrome remain poorly understood (1Somlo S. Mundel P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 2Smoyer W.E. Mundel P. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Glomerular visceral epithelial cells appear to play a central role in maintaining the selective filtration barrier of the renal glomerulus. These cells are also termed podocytes to describe the foot-like appearance of numerous interdigitating processes that arise from their cell bodies and cover glomerular capillary walls. Glomerular filtrate passes across the specialized intercellular junction-also termed the “slit diaphragm” formed at the interface of these interdigitated foot processes (3Reiser J. Kriz W. Kretzler M. Mundel P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to glomerular injury, podocytes undergo a dramatic change in morphology termed “foot process effacement” resulting in retraction and spreading of foot processes and alteration in their intercellular junctions (4Seiler, M. W., Rennke, H. G., Venkatachalam, M. A., and Cotran, R. S. (1997) 36, 48–61Google Scholar). Foot process effacement is a fluid and reversible process that correlates closely with the development of proteinuria both in human disease and in experimental models (2Smoyer W.E. Mundel P. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 5Kriz W. Gretz N. Lemley K.V. Kidney. Int. 1998; 54: 687-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Clearly, foot process effacement requires precise interplay of multiple cellular processes, including alterations in the structure of the cytoskeleton, movement of foot process over the basement membrane, and disassembly or re-assembly of the intercellular junction that comprises the slit diaphragm. Each of these unique but interdependent cellular processes are in and of themselves complex. The cellular and molecular mechanisms governing podocyte morphology and filter integrity are incompletely defined. Recent investigations have focused on identifying and characterizing the interrelationships and functions of the molecular components of the foot process intercellular junction, because several of these components, including Nephrin (6Kestila M.

Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), have been demonstrated to be necessary for development of normal podocyte structure and filter integrity. Nephrin is encoded by NPHS1, the gene mutated in congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type, a rare autosomal recessive developmental disorder manifest at birth by heavy proteinuria and diffuse podocyte foot process effacement (9Holmberg C.

Deletion of Nephrin by gene targeting in mice results in a similar phenotype (11Putaala H. Soininen R. Kilpelainen P. Wartiovaara J. Tryggvason K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In the kidney, Nephrin expression is podocyte-specific, and the protein is targeted to the lateral aspect of foot process cell membranes in the region of the slit diaphragm (12Ruotsalainen V. Ljungberg P. Wartiovaara J. Lenkkeri U. Kestila M. Jalanko H. Holmberg C. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7962-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 13Holzman L.B.

Nephrin is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. For this reason, it has been proposed that Nephrin is a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) 1The abbreviations used are: CAM, cell adhesion molecule; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane fraction; CD, cytoplasmic domain; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine; PP3, 4-amino-7-phenylpyrazol[3,4-d]pyrimidine; SFK, Src family kinase. that participates in forming the glomerular filter via interactions involving its extracellular domain (12Ruotsalainen V. Ljungberg P. Wartiovaara J. Lenkkeri U. Kestila M. Jalanko H. Holmberg C. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7962-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). More than simply mediating cellular interactions, various Ig superfamily CAMs behave as signal transducing molecules. Depending on the particular CAM involved, Ig superfamily CAMs can play a role in either “outside-in” signaling in which a signal is transduced into the cell following ligand binding or can participate in “inside-out” signaling in which signals originating within the cell result in changes in binding characteristics of the CAM. Like other transmembrane proteins, Nephrin participates in a protein complex at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. To date, Nephrin has been shown to associate with Podocin, the protein product of NPHS2 that is mutated in an inherited form of steroid-resistant focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (7Boute N. Gribouval O. Roselli S. Benessy F. Lee H. Fuchshuber A. Dahan K. Gubler M.C. Niaudet P. Antignac C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Nephrin also binds CD2ap, an adapter protein whose genetic deletion in mice results in foot process effacement and proteinuria (8Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 14Shih N.Y. Li J. Cotran R. Mundel P. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 2303-2308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that, in a fashion similar to other cell adhesion molecules, Nephrin might function in intracellular signal transduction. Nephrin-dependent signaling might be mediated in part through Nephrin phosphorylation. Indeed, as described herein, biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrates that, in the plasma membrane of podocytes, Nephrin is tyrosine-phosphorylated by the Src family protein kinase Fyn. Reagents—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the cytoplasmic domain of mouse Nephrin (13Holzman L.B. St John P.L. Kovari I.A. Verma R. Holthofer H. Abrahamson D.R.

Sanden S.K. Soofi A. Wiggins R.C. Holzman L.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1561-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were described previously. Rabbit antibody to a GST fusion protein containing the first and second SH3 domains of mouse CD2ap was raised by immunizing rabbits (performed at Lampire Biological Laboratories Inc., Pipersville, PA). Anti-FLAG epitope monoclonal antibody (M2, Sigma) and antibodies to phosphotyrosine (PY66, Sigma Chemical Co.), pan-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Fyn (Transduction Laboratory or Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Yes (Upstate Biotechnology), c-Src (Santa Cruz), and α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and control mouse and rabbit immunoglobulin (Sigma Chemical Co.) were obtained commercially. Plasmid vectors encoding GST-FynSH3SH2, GST-FynSH3, and GST-FynSH2 were previously described (16Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 4: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-Fyn fusion proteins and hexahistidine-tagged Nephrin cytoplasmic domain (13Holzman L.B.

Mammalian expression plasmids encoding wild type Fyn, Yes, and FynΔSH3 were previously described (16Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 4: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression plasmid encoding mouse FLAG-Nephrin was prepared in a manner similar to that previously described (19Nihalani D. Merritt S. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7273-7279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The mammalian expression construct encoding a FLAG-tagged form of the entire cytoplasmic domain of mouse Nephrin (F-NephrinCD) was prepared by a standard PCR cloning technique using pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). PP2, a specific inhibitor of Src kinases and PP3, its inactive analogue, were obtained from Calbiochem. Partially purified Fyn (Upstate Biotechnology), recombinant c-Src (Upstate), and enolase (Sigma) were obtained commercially. Cell Culture—Transient transfections were carried out in COS7 cells. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 200 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Roche Applied Science). Transfections were performed using Fugene-6 (Roche Applied Science). Where indicated, cells were cultured in the presence of 50 μm pervanadate for 40 min prior to harvesting cells. For orthophosphate metabolic labeling of cells, 24 h after transfection, cells were washed and incubated with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum containing 1 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences) for 5 h at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments were performed using the indicated antibodies as described elsewhere (19Nihalani D. Merritt S. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7273-7279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Where indicated Nephrin and indicated Src family protein kinases were extracted from plasma membranes in RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered 0.9% NaCl (PBS) containing 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed essentially as described elsewhere (17Mata M. Merritt S.E. Fan G. Yu G.G. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16888-16896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Following metabolic labeling, Nephrin was immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the radioactive band of the appropriate molecular weight was excised. Phosphoamino acids were separated by one-dimensional electrophoresis. Phosphoamino acid standards were visualized by ninhydrin staining, and radioactivity was detected by using a PhosphorImager (Storm, Amersham Biosciences). Mouse and Rat Husbandry—Male and female homozygous null breeding pairs for Yes–/– mice (129-Yestm1Sor; stock number 002280) and Fyn–/– mice (B6;129S-Fyntm1Sor; stock number 002385) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me). Yes –/– mouse and Fyn –/– mouse colonies were obtained by inbreeding. Fyn–/–Yes–/– double knockout mice were obtained by successively intercrossing Yes–/– mice with Fyn–/– mice, and Yes–/–Fyn+/– with Fyn+/– mice. Genomic DNA was made from tail tips clipped at weaning using a QIAamp tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A PCR assay was established to genotype mice as described on the Jackson Laboratories web site. For Fyn null mice, the following primers were employed: 5′-CTT GGG TGG AGA GGC TAT TC-3′ (Neo1 generic neo forward primer), 5′-AGG TGA GAT GAC AGG AGA TC-3′ (Neo2 generic neo reverse primer), 5′-TTA CCC TCT GAG CAT CTG AC-3′ (Fyn intron forward primer from Paul Stein, Wistar Institute), 5′-GCA AAA CAA CCC ACA CAG AG-3′ (Fyn reverse primer). The size of the expected Fyn-specific amplification product is 600 bp from the wild type allele. For Yes null mice, the following primers were employed: 5′-TGT GTG TCC TAC TGT GAA ACC C-3′ (Yes KO forward primer), 5′-GCA TCC TTG ACC TAG TTT CAC-3′ (Yes KO reverse primer), and 5′-GAT CTC GTC GTG ACC CAT G-3′ (Yes forward primer 2). A 103-bp product was expected from the wild type Yes allele. A 600-bp and a 358-bp product were expected from the targeted allele. Sprague-Dawley mice (100–120 g) were obtained from Harlan, Inc. The University of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals approved all procedures using rats and mice. All work was conducted in accord with the principles and procedures outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals. Glomerular Isolation—Adult kidneys were obtained where indicated from rats or mice. Glomeruli were isolated by sieving as described elsewhere (13Holzman L.B. St John P.L. Kovari I.A. Verma R. Holthofer H. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1481-1491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The average purity of the glomerular preparations was ∼60% for mice and 90% for rat preparations. Glomeruli were lysed in the indicated buffer containing protease inhibitors at a concentration of 10,000 glomeruli per milliliter of extraction buffer. Flotation Gradient Preparations—Isolated glomeruli from rat or mouse kidneys were homogenized at 4 °C with 14 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer in a buffer containing 250 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Invitrogen). To the homogenate, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% and mixed well. The mixture was maintained on ice for 15 min before being mixed with 60% Optiprep (Nycomed Pharma AS) to obtain a final density of 40%. Five milliliters of this mixture was added to pre-cooled centrifuge tubes then layered with 3 ml of 30% Optiprep and 4 ml of 5% Optiprep. Optiprep dilutions were obtained by diluting 60% stock Optiprep with Tricine buffer containing 20 mm Tricine, 0.25 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA. The gradient was centrifuged at 169,044 × g in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor for 3 h at 4 °C. The Triton X-100-insoluble membrane fraction (detergent-resistant membrane fractions, DRMs) was observed at the interface between 5 and 30% Optiprep densities. Top to bottom 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed as indicated. Spot Urine Albumin/Creatinine Ratios—Spot urine samples collected from mice after physical stimulation were analyzed for albumin concentration using a commercial murine microalbuminuria enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Albuwell, Exocell Inc., Philadelphia, PA) and for creatinine concentration by the alkaline picrate method (Sigma, catalog no. 555; St. Louis, MO). In Vitro Kinase Assay on Glomerular DRM—Glomerular DRM fractions were isolated, resuspended in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) and pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. These pellets were resuspended in kinase buffer containing 25 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. Reactions were carried out in the presence of 10 μm PP2 or PP3 where indicated. Pellets were pelleted and washed once with kinase buffer lacking ATP MgCl2 and MnCl2. Pellets were extracted with RIPA buffer and centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and the obtained supernatants were immunoprecipitated or further analyzed as indicated in the text. Pull-down Assay—Indicated GST fusion proteins were incubated either with isolated glomerular extract (RIPA buffer extraction) or with lysate obtained from COS7 cells transfected with plasmid encoding Nephrin. The mixtures were diluted to 500 μl with PBS, and 25 μl of glutathione agarose was added to each tube. The tubes were further incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Following incubation beads in the tubes were washed five times using PBST (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 1% Triton X-100) to remove the unbound protein. The bound protein was then eluted using 5 mm reduced glutathione. The eluates were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting as indicated. In Vitro Kinase Assay—One microgram of hexahistidine-tagged Nephrin cytoplasmic domain was incubated with 1 μg of partially purified Fyn or enolase in kinase buffer containing 25 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. Reactions were carried out in the presence of 10 μm PP2 or PP3 where indicated. Reactions were terminated with SDS loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by autoradiography. Electron Microscopy—Preparation of samples for transmission electron microscopy was performed by standard methods using pieces of diced kidney perfusion fixed in glutaraldehyde/cacodylate buffer. After plastic embedding, 1-μm sections were cut and stained with toluidine blue. Selected samples containing glomeruli were thin-sectioned and examined by transmission electron microscopy (20Wharram B.L. Goyal M. Gillespie P.J. Wiggins J.E. Kershaw D.B. Holzman L.B. Dysko R.C. Saunders T.L. Samuelson L.C. Wiggins R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For assessment of glomerular morphology, kidneys from four mice each at 4- and 7-week time points for each of the three genetic mutants were examined. Twenty glomeruli from each kidney were examined before representative images were chosen. Statistics—Statistical significance for urine albumin/creatinine ratios was assessed using one-way analysis of variance, and Bonferroni's multiple comparison test was used for post-hoc analysis. The Nephrin Cytoplasmic Domain Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated—Sequence analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of Nephrin suggested that Nephrin might be tyrosine-phosphorylated. To initially examine this possibility, plasmid encoding FLAG-epitope-tagged Nephrin cytoplasmic domain (Nephrin-CD) was expressed by transient transfection in COS7 cells. Nephrin-CD was examined as described in Fig. 1 by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the Nephrin-CD was detected following treatment with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate (Fig. 1A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Nephrin-CD was not observed in the absence of pervanadate pretreatment (not shown). Phosphoamino acid analysis of Nephrin-CD expressed in COS7 cells that were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate confirmed that Nephrin phosphorylation occurred on tyrosine and not on serine and threonine residues (Fig. 1B). Given these preliminary observations, we examined the phosphorylation state of endogenous Nephrin expressed in adult rat glomeruli. Prior to removal of kidneys, rat renal arteries were perfused with physiologic buffer containing or not containing pervanadate. Endogenous Nephrin obtained by immunoprecipitation from the lysates of isolated glomeruli pre-treated with pervanadate was tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 1C). In most experiments, tyrosine phosphorylation was not detected on Nephrin obtained from kidney perfused with buffer lacking pervanadate. However, in some experiments, prolonged exposure of immunoblots to film or the use of a more sensitive enzymatic substrate (Femto, Pierce) to develop immunoblots allowed the detection of Nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). Nephrin Fractionates with Fyn and Yes Protein Kinases in Triton X-100-insoluble Glomerular Membrane Fractions—In part, Nephrin associates with a Triton X-100-insoluble membrane fraction obtained from isolated glomeruli (21Simons M. Schwarz K. Kriz W. Miettinen A. Reiser J. Mundel P. Holthofer H. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, tyrosine-specific Src family protein kinases associate with detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fractions in a number of cell types (22Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5164) Google Scholar, 23Cary L.A. Cooper J.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 945-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Given this association, we investigated the hypothesis that an Src-family kinase or kinases are responsible, at least in part, for Nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation. Initially, the co-fractionation of Nephrin and several Src family kinases in detergent-resistant glomerular lipid membrane fractions was examined (Fig. 2). Isolated rat glomeruli were lysed at 4 °C in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and the lysate was fractionated by flotation gradient centrifugation. Like Nephrin, Src family kinases Fyn and Yes but not c-Src were detected in the detergent-resistant membrane fraction. As described previously, Podocin and CD2ap (in part) fractionated in the same DRM fraction. Evidence That Nephrin Serves as a Substrate for src Family Kinases—A kinase activity assay was developed to investigate catalytic activity of protein kinases that utilize Nephrin as substrate in the isolated glomerular DRM fraction. After isolation, the glomerular Triton X-100-insoluble membrane fraction was resuspended and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in a kinase buffer containing [32P]ATP and Mg2+ and Mn2+. DRM was then re-extracted with RIPA buffer that had been previously observed to release membrane-associated Nephrin. Nephrin was immunoprecipitated from this supernatant, and immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. As shown in Fig. 3, DRM-associated Nephrin, migrating at the anticipated apparent molecular mass of 185 kDa, became phosphorylated under the conditions of this assay. However, when this assay was carried out in the presence of PP2, a specific inhibitor of Src family kinase activity, DRM-associated Nephrin was not phosphorylated. When carried out in the presence of PP3, an inactive analogue of PP2, DRM-associated Nephrin remained phosphorylated. Following incubation in kinase buffer, unextracted DRM fractions were also examined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. A prominent set of proteins with a mobility consistent with that of Src family kinases were identified at ∼58 kDa; phosphorylation of these proteins was not identified when incubation of DRM was carried out in the presence of PP2. It was concluded that DRM-associated Nephrin might be phosphorylated by a Src family protein kinase located in a podocyte detergent-resistant membrane fraction. To strengthen the hypothesis that Nephrin serves as a substrate for Src family protein kinase, the capacity of endogenous Nephrin to interact with endogenous Fyn or Yes was investigated (Fig. 4). Lysate obtained from isolated rat glomeruli was immunoprecipitated with anti-Nephrin antibody. These immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and examined by immunoblotting for the presence of Fyn or Yes. Fyn and Yes both co-immunoprecipitated with Nephrin. In reciprocal experiments, Nephrin co-immunoprecipitated with Fyn. However, attempts to co-immunoprecipitate Nephrin with anti-Yes antibody did not succeed despite trials with two distinct anti-Yes antibodies. The Fyn domain sufficient for interaction with Nephrin was mapped in pull-down experiments (Fig. 5). Isolated recombinant GST-Fyn-SH2 or -SH3 or composite -SH3SH2 domains were purified from bacterial lysates. Prior to lysis, COS7 cells transfected with plasmid encoding wild type Nephrin were treated without or with pervanadate to increase Nephrin phosphorylation. In these experiments, Fyn SH3 domain but not its SH2 domain interacted with Nephrin obtained from COS7 cells pretreated with pervanadate (Fig. 5A). In contrast, Nephrin obtained from COS7 cells that were not pretreated with pervanadate did not interact with either the Fyn SH3 or its SH2 domain. In similar pull-down experiments, GST-Fyn SH3 but not Fyn SH2 interacted with Nephrin obtained from lysates of isolated glomeruli (Fig. 5B). The binding affinity of Nephrin for Fyn or Yes was also examined in co-transfection experiments (Fig. 6). As anticipated, wild type Nephrin co-immunoprecipitated with wild type Fyn and Yes. Consistent with results of the pull-down experiments described above, Fyn or Yes deleted of their SH3 domains had significantly attenuated affinity for Nephrin in these co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Of note, pervanadate treatment of transfected cells prior to lysis resulted in attenuation of the affinity of Fyn and Yes for Nephrin"

Previous studies have shown that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) is involved in regulating another mitochondrial protein, cytochrome c during apoptosis; however, the role of JNK in the release of mitochondrial Smac is unknown. Here we show that induction of apoptosis in multiple myeloma (MM) cells is associated with activation of JNK, translocation of JNK from cytosol to mitochondria, and release of Smac from mitochondria to cytosol. Blocking JNK either by dominant-negative mutant (DN-JNK) or cotreatment with a specific JNK inhibitor, SP600125, abrogates both stress-induced release of Smac and induction of apoptosis.

Once activated, the effector caspases induce proteolytic cleavage of various cellular targets, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)1 (4Oberhammer F.A. Hochegger K. Froschl G. Tiefenbacher R.

Mononuclear cells were isolated from a patient with MM (PCL cells) by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and incubated with HB-7 (anti-CD38) MoAb-biotin-streptavidin and 2H4 (anti-CD45RA) MoAb-fluorescein isothiocyanate on ice. Tumor cells (96 + 2% CD38 + 45RA-) were isolated using an Epics C cell sorter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL), washed, and resuspended in regular growth medium. Cells were treated with 3 μm of 2ME2, or 10 nm proteasome inhibitor PS-341, as described previously (11Chauhan D. Catley L. Hideshima T. Li G. Leblanc R. Gupta D. Sattler M. Richardson P.

Dual fluorescence staining with DNA-binding fluorochrome Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide was used to quantitate the percentage of apoptotic (propidium iodide-Hoechst 33342+) cells by flow cytometry (The Vantage, BD Biosciences), as described previously (11Chauhan D.

MM.1S or patient MM cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the pellet was suspended in 3 volumes of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A) containing 250 nm sucrose. The cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer, and cytosolic or mitochondrial extracts were isolated as described previously (19Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Rosen S. Reed J.C. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24453-24456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated from cell lysates by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-Smac (kindly provided by Dr. Xiaodong Wang, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas), anti-cyto-c(Sigma), anti-Hsp60 (Stressgen), anti-phospho-specific JNK (New England Biolabs), as well as anti-PARP (Pharmingen), or anti-JNK and anti-SHP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) Abs. The blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), using the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). MM.1S cells were transiently transfected using “cell line NucleofectoTM kit V,” according to manufacturer's instructions (Amaxa Biosystems), with vector alone or DN-JNK and cotransfected with vector containing green fluorescence protein (GFP) alone. Following transfections, GFP-positive cells were selected by flow cytometry, treated with 2ME2 (3 μm) and analyzed for cell viability as described above. Additionally, cytosolic extracts from these cells were also analyzed for the accumulation of Smac by Western blotting as described previously. Cell viability was assessed by MTT (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and trypan blue exclusion, as described previously (11Chauhan D. Catley L. Hideshima T. Li G. Leblanc R. Gupta D. Sattler M. Richardson P. Schlossman R.L. Podar K. Weller E. Munshi N. Anderson K.C. Blood. 2002; 100: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). MM.1S cells were treated with 2ME2 in the presence or absence of JNK inhibitor (SP600125) for 12 h, harvested, and analyzed for mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). 2ME2 or dexamethasone-treated MM cells were stained with lipophilic cationic dye CMXRos (Mitotracker Red) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at 37 °C and analyzed by flow cytometry to assay for alterations in ΔΨm. To examine whether 2ME2 induces apoptosis in the MM.1S MM cells, we performed flow cytometric analysis using propidium iodide and Hoechst staining. Treatment of cells with 3 μm 2ME2 for 24 h significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells (51% ± 3.6%, p < 0.005, n = 3), as in our prior studies (11Chauhan D. Catley L. Hideshima T. Li G.

Previous studies have shown that activation of JNK plays an important role in apoptosis (14Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). To examine whether 2ME2 induces activation of JNK, MM.1S MM cells were exposed to 2ME2 for various time intervals, and JNK activity was analyzed byin vitro immune complex kinase assays using GST-Jun as a substrate. Analysis of anti-JNK immunoprecipitates demonstrated significant (8–10-fold) increase in GST-Jun phosphorylation, indicating the activation of JNK (Fig.1A, upper left panel). Moreover, cotreatment of MM.1S cells with SP600125, a specific inhibitor of JNK (17Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y.

A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar), blocks 2ME2-induced JNK activity (Fig.1A, upper left panel). This activation of JNK in response to 2ME2 does not alter JNK protein levels (Fig. 1A,lower left panel). Increase in JNK activity was detectable as early as 1h after 2ME2 treatment and peaked at 12 h/24 h (Fig. 1A, upper right panel). Our findings are in concert with those of Verheij et al. (15Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yhao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar), which demonstrate a role of JNK in ceramide- and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis. Moreover, coordinate regulation of JNKs, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinases facilitates apoptosis induced by withdrawal of growth factor, suggesting that activation of JNK may be essential for apoptosis (20Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). We next examined the mechanism whereby JNK mediates its apoptotic effects during 2ME2-induced apoptosis. Translocation of JNK from cytosol to the nucleus has been shown in response to osmotic stress (21Kawasaki H. Moriguchi T. Matsuda S. Li H.Z. Nakamura S. Shimohama S. Kimura J. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Other studies showed that JNK translocates to mitochondria after genotoxic stress and inhibits the anti-apoptotic function of proteins belonging to Bcl2 family members (22Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Yoshida K. Pandey P. Kaneki M. Wang Q. Cheng K. Chen Y.N. Campbell A. Sudha T. Yuan Z.M. Narula J. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 322-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 23Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar), thereby allowing the release of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins to cytosol and subsequent activation of caspase cascades. We next therefore determined whether 2ME2 induces translocation of JNK to mitochondria or nucleus in MM cells. Cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear extracts from untreated and 2ME2-treated MM.1S cells were assayed for the JNK protein levels. As seen in Fig. 1B (upper panel), 2ME2 significantly increases JNK protein level in mitochondrial fraction (4–5-fold, as assessed by densitometry). Purity of mitochondria was confirmed by reprobing the blots with an antibody against mitochondrial-specific Hsp60 protein (Fig. 1B, lower panel). No increases in JNK protein levels in the nuclear fractions were detected in 2ME2-treated cells (data not shown). Together, these findings demonstrate that 2ME2-induced apoptosis is associated with both activation of JNK and its translocation to mitochondria. These results suggest a potential involvement of mitochondria during 2ME2-induced apoptosis in MM cells. Mitochondria harbor two key modulators of apoptosis, cyto-cand Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase) or DIABLO, which are released from mitochondria into the cytosol during apoptosis (5Liu X. Naekyung Kim C. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4462) Google Scholar, 6Yang J. Liu X. Balla K. Kim C.N. Ibardo N.M. Cai J.

Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The upstream signal(s) that triggers the release of these proteins from mitochondria to cytosol is unclear. A recent study showed that activated JNK is required for the cyto-c release and associated apoptosis (12Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar); however, the influence of JNK signaling on the release of Smac is presently undefined. Given that 2ME2 activates JNK in MM cells and JNK translocates to mitochondria, we next assessed whether 2ME2-induces the release of Smac and whether 2ME2-activated JNK mediates the release of Smac. MM.1S cells were treated with 2ME2, in the presence or absence of JNK inhibitor SP600125; cytosolic extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analyses with anti-Smac Ab. As seen in Fig. 1C (upper panel), 2ME2 induces the release of Smac, as in our previous study (11Chauhan D. Catley L. Hideshima T. Li G. Leblanc R. Gupta D. Sattler M. Richardson P. Schlossman R.L. Podar K. Weller E. Munshi N. Anderson K.C. Blood. 2002; 100: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Importantly, cotreatment with SP600125 significantly inhibits the release of Smac (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Reprobing the immunoblots with anti-SHP2 (as control) confirms equal protein loading (Fig. 1C, lower panel). These findings demonstrate that 2ME2-induced JNK activation is required for the mitochondrial release of Smac. Examination of the effects of 2ME2 on the release of cyto-c, as well as requirement of JNK for the release of cyto-c, demonstrated similar results (Fig.1D). To further address this issue, we transiently transfected MM.1S cells with either dominant-negative mutant of JNK (pEBG-DN-JNK) or control vector; following treatment with 2ME2, cytosolic extracts were analyzed for accumulation of Smac in the cytosol. As seen in Fig. 1E (first panel), overexpression of DN-JNK abrogates the 2ME2-induced release of Smac from mitochondria to cytosol. To confirm the expression of endogenous JNK and exogenous DN-JNK (GST-DN-JNK), filters were reprobed with anti-JNK antibody (Fig. 1E, second panel). Immunoblotting with phospho-specific JNK antibody showed a marked decrease in 2ME2-induced JNK activity in cells transfected with DN-JNK compared with empty vector (Fig. 1E, third panel), which confirmed the function of DN-JNK. Immunoblotting with anti-GFP and anti-SHP2 Abs demonstrated equal transfection efficiency and protein loading, respectively (Fig. 1E,fourth and fifth panels). To further confirm the specificity of DN-JNK, we examined lysates from DN-JNK transfected cells for both p38 MAPK and JNK activity using GST-ATF2 and GST-Jun as substrates, in an in vitro immune complex kinase assays. DN-JNK blocked 2ME2-induced JNK, but not p38MAPK activity (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that JNK is required for the release of Smac during 2ME2-induced apoptosis in MM cells. We next determined the functional significance of 2ME2-induced JNK activation. MM.1S cells were transiently transfected with either DN-JNK or empty vector and treated with 2ME2. As seen in Fig.2A, after treatment with 2ME2, MM.1S DN-JNK transfectants survived significantly longer than cells transfected with vector alone: median viability was 48% (24 h) and 24% (48 h) after 2ME2 treatment of empty vector transfected cellsversus 73% (24 h) and 45% (48 h) after 2ME2 treatment of DN-JNK transfected MM.1S cells (p = 0.05, as determined by one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Similar results were obtained in MM.1S cells treated with 2ME2 in the presence or absence of JNK inhibitor (Fig. 2B). As a control for specificity of a JNK inhibitor SP600125, we also treated cells with 2ME2 in the presence or absence of p38MAPK inhibitor. As seen in Fig. 2B, in contrast to SP600125, p38MAPK inhibitor does not attenuates 2ME2-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, blockade of JNK also inhibits 2ME2-induced PARP cleavage, a signature event during apoptosis (Fig.2C). Other studies have reported that a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) causes release of Smac and cyto-c (5Liu X. Naekyung Kim C. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4462) Google Scholar, 9Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar), and we therefore asked whether 2ME2-induced apoptosis correlates with changes in ΔΨm, and whether inhibition of JNK affects the ΔΨm. As seen in Fig.2D, 2ME2 triggers a significant decrease in ΔΨm, and conversely, cotreatment with JNK inhibitor SP600125 prevents 2ME2-induced reduction in Ψm. Together, these data suggest that blockade of JNK decreased 2ME2-induced apoptosis. Our prior study demonstrated that 2ME2-induced apoptosis is associated with activation of caspase-8 and -9 (11Chauhan D. Catley L. Hideshima T. Li G. Leblanc R. Gupta D. Sattler M. Richardson P. Schlossman R.L. Podar K. Weller E. Munshi N. Anderson K.C. Blood. 2002; 100: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and both are known to activate downstream caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. In contrast to caspase-9, caspase-8-mediated apoptotic signaling may proceed independent of cyto-c or Smac release. It is likely, therefore, that the caspase-8 pathway may still be operative in response to 2ME2 despite the expression of DN-JNK, which may explain for the lack of complete protection provided by DN-JNK against 2ME2-induced apoptosis. Moreover, other upstream molecules besides JNK may modulate 2ME2-triggered Smac release, and further studies are required to understand these mechanisms. Nevertheless our present findings demonstrate that JNK, at least in part, mediates 2ME2-induced apoptosis in MM cells. To determine whether other apoptotic inducers in MM cells similarly affect the JNK-Smac signaling pathways, we treated MM.1S cells with a proteasome inhibitor PS-341 (10 nm) in the presence or absence of SP600125, and cell extracts were analyzed for both JNK activity and accumulation of Smac in the cytosol. PS-341 treatment of MM.1S cells triggers significant JNK activity, as well as release of Smac (Fig. 3, A andB, upper panels). Cotreatment with JNK inhibitor significantly blocks the PS-341-triggered release of Smac (Fig. 3,A and B, upper panels), further confirming the requirement of JNK for release of Smac. Furthermore, similar results were obtained when patient MM (PCL) cells were exposed to 2ME2 (Fig. 3C). Exogenous JNK has been shown to phosphorylate many mitochondrial proteins during apoptosis (23Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar); however, not all apoptotic agents trigger a sequential activation of JNK and mitochondrial pathways (25Gibson E.M. Henson E.S.

Our prior studies showed that dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in MM.1S occurs independent of JNK activation, but is associated with Smac release (18Chauhan D. Pandey P. Ogata A. Teoh G. Treon S. Urashima M. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The observation that 2ME2 induces JNK activation in MM.1S cells suggest that JNK signaling is not defective in these cells. This is in concert with other studies demonstrating that anti-Fas-induced apoptosis is associated with the release of cyto-c in JNK-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, whereas UV-induced apoptosis in these same cells requires JNK activation for release of cyto-c (12Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that both activation of JNK and its requirement for the release of mitochondrial proteins are stimuli-specific. Collectively, our present study shows that two distinct apoptotic agents in MM cells induce JNK, which upon activation translocates to mitochondria and triggers the release of Smac. Inhibition of JNK activation by either DN-JNK or a specific inhibitor of JNK disables JNK-mediated Smac release and associated apoptosis. Finally, our findings have important biologic and therapeutic implications. Given that synthetic Smac peptides enhance the apoptotic activity of chemotherapeutic agents (27Arnt C.R. Chiorean M.V.

Chem. 2002; 277: 44236-44243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), coupled with our present results showing that anti-MM drugs induce apoptosis via release of mitochondrial Smac, suggest that Smac agonists or active Smac peptides may sensitize MM cells to 2ME2 or PS-341-induced cell death. We thank Dr. Xiaodong Wang for providing Smac-related reagents and helpful suggestions, as well as J. Kyriakis and L. Zon for SAPK cDNA constructs."
https://openalex.org/W2071457248,"Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT)is involved in a secondary pathway for production of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in liver. We fed Pemt-/-mice a high fat/high cholesterol diet for 3 weeks to determine whether or not PC derived from PEMT is required for very low density lipoprotein secretion. Lipid analyses of plasma and liver indicated that male Pemt-/- mice accumulated triacylglycerols in their livers and were unable to secrete the same amount of triacylglycerols from the liver as did Pemt+/+ mice. Plasma levels of triacylglycerol and both apolipoproteins B100 and B48 were significantly decreased only in male Pemt-/- mice. Experiments in which mice were injected with Triton WR1339 showed that, whereas hepatic apoB100 secretion was decreased in male Pemt-/- mice, the decrease in plasma apoB48 in male Pemt-/- mice was not due to reduced secretion. Moreover, female and, to a lesser extent, male Pemt-/- mice showed a striking 40% decrease in plasma PC and cholesterol in high density lipoproteins. These results suggest that, even though the content of hepatic PC was normal in PEMT-deficient mice, plasma lipoprotein levels were profoundly altered in a gender-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2009292693,"Keratocan (Kera) is a cornea-specific keratan sulfate proteoglycan (KSPG) in the adult vertebrate eye. It belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) gene family and is one of the major components of extracellular KSPG in the vertebrate corneal stroma. The Kera gene is expressed in ocular surface tissues including cornea and eyelids during morphogenesis. Corneal KSPGs play a pivotal role in matrix assembly, which is accountable for corneal transparency. In humans, mutations of the KERA gene are associated with cornea plana (CNA2) that manifests decreases in vision acuity due to the flattened forward convex curvature of cornea. To investigate the biological role of the Kera gene and to establish an animal model for corneal plana, we generated Kera knockout mice via gene targeting. Northern and Western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis showed that no Kera mRNA or keratocan protein was detected in the Kera–/– cornea. The expression levels of other SLRP members including lumican, decorin, and fibromodulin were not altered in the Kera–/– cornea as compared with that of the wild-type littermates. Mice lacking keratocan have normal corneal transparency at the age of 12 months. However, they have a thinner corneal stroma and a narrower cornea-iris angle of the anterior segment in comparison to the wild-type littermates. As demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy, Kera–/– mice have larger stromal fibril diameters and less organized packing of collagen fibrils in stroma than those of wild type. Taken together, our results showed that ablation of the Kera gene resulted in subtle structural alterations of collagenous matrix and did not perturb the expression of other SLRPs in cornea. Keratocan thus plays a unique role in maintaining the appropriate corneal shape to ensure normal vision.

Keratocan thus plays a unique role in maintaining the appropriate corneal shape to ensure normal vision. The vertebrate cornea is a tough and transparent tissue that provides greater than 60% of refractive power to the incoming light to cast a focused image on retina. To exact its proper functions, the cornea has to maintain transparent, appropriate curvature for refraction and toughness for protection. Genetic and epigenetic factors that cause the change of corneal curvature, reduction of transparency, and weakness in structure can lead to the impairment of visual acuity. The corneal stroma consists of uniformly small collagen fibrils with an average diameter of 25 nm that are arranged in orthogonal lamellae. Stromal keratocytes are responsible for the formation and maintenance of a unique collagenous matrix that is essential for proper corneal curvature and transparency (1Linsenmayer T.F. Fitch J.M.

The mechanisms that govern the assembly of different levels of stromal architecture are not well understood; however, proteoglycan-collagen and collagen-collagen interactions have been implicated. It has been suggested that the stoichiometry and interaction of different collagen types play an important role in modulating collagen fibril diameter (1Linsenmayer T.F. Fitch J.M. Birk D.E. Ann. N.

In addition to interactions with collagen fibrils, corneal stromal proteoglycans also play a role in corneal hydration due to the highly negative charge of their sulfated carbohydrate moieties and the glycosaminoglycan chains. Keratocan, lumican, and mimecan/osteoglycin are the major keratan sulfate-containing proteoglycans in vertebrate corneal stroma. Their core proteins consist of 6–10 tandem repeats of 24 amino acids with hydrophobic residues in conserved positions. We and others have recently shown that mice lacking lumican revealed an age-dependent corneal opacity and a high proportion of abnormally thick collagen fibrils in the corneal stroma (12Charkravarti S. Magnuson T. Lass J.H. Jepsen K.J. LaMantia C. Carroll H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 112: 987-996Google Scholar, 13Chakravarti S. Petroll W.M. Hassell J.R. Jester J.V. Lass J.H. Paul J. Birk D.E. Investig.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2607-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In humans, the first SLRP gene that is directly linked to a disease is the keratocan gene (KERA). Mutations of the human KERA gene are associated with cornea plana (CNA2) in which the forward convex curvature is flattened, leading to a decrease in light refraction (15Pellegata N.S. Dieguez-Lucena J.L. Joensuu T. Lau S. Montgomery K.T. Krahe R. Kivela T. Kucherlapati R. Forsius H. de la Chapelle A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The clinical synopsis of CNA2 includes reduced visual activity, extreme hyperopia, hazy corneal limbus, corneal parenchymal opacities, thin corneal stroma, and indistinct sclerocorneal boundary. Moreover CNA2 with extremely flat cornea is often associated with angle closure glaucoma. We have found previously that, unlike lumican or mimecan/osteoglycin, which is ubiquitously expressed by most interstitial connective tissues, keratocan expression is specific to the adult corneal stroma in the mouse. During embryonic development, Kera gene expression tracks ocular surface tissues morphogenesis including cornea and eyelids (16Liu C.-Y. Shiraishi A Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Funderburgh J.L.

To investigate the biological role of the Kera in vivo and to generate an animal model for corneal plana, we created Kera knockout mice via gene targeting. Western Blotting—To characterize keratocan in wild-type mice, two corneas were isolated from both eyes of normal FVB/N postnatal day 1, 7, and 14 mice. The corneas were minced and extracted in 1 ml of 4 m guanidine-HCl containing 10 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm sodium EDTA, 5 mmp-aminobenzamidine, and 0.1 m [epsis ]-amino-n-caproic acid at 4 °C overnight. The extracts were dialyzed exhaustively in distilled water at room temperature, and the water-insoluble fraction was dissolved in 0.1 m Tris acetate solution (pH 6.0) containing 6 m urea. The protein concentration was measured by spectrophotometer at A280 nm. Aliquots (100 μg of protein) were incubated with or without endo-β-galactosidase (0.1 unit/ml) at 37 °C overnight. An equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer was added into digested and undigested samples, boiled for 5 min, electrophoresed on an SDS-PAGE gradient (4–15%) or regular 10% gel, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Affinity-purified antibodies against mouse keratocan peptide (VRQAYEIQDPEDWDVHDDFYC) were raised in rabbit and used to detect the keratocan in corneal samples. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (heavy and light) was used as secondary antibody, and the immunocomplex was visualized with a Western Blue™ kit (Promega, Madison, WI). To detect decorin and fibromodulin of the mouse corneas, affinity-purified antibodies against mouse decorin peptide (IIPYDPDNPLISMC (17Fisher L.W. Stubbs III, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (heavy and light) was used as secondary antibody, and the immunocomplex was visualized with ECL™ Western blotting detection substrate (Pierce). Generation of Kera Knockout Mice by Gene Targeting—The mouse keratocan genomic 6.6-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment, which contains 3.1-kb promoter, exon 1, intron 1, exon 2, and 1.1-kb intron 2, was first cloned into pBluescript SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the resulting plasmid was named pKera-BR6.6 (16Liu C.-Y. Shiraishi A Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Funderburgh J.L. Corpuz L.M. Conrad G.W. Kao W.W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22584-22588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A 0.6-kb XbaI fragment was then deleted from the 5′ end of the pKera-BR6.6, and the plasmid was self-ligated. Next a 2.6-kb XhoI fragment containing 1.0-kb intron 1, entire exon 2, and 1.1-kb intron 2 was deleted from the 3′ end and replaced with a positive selection marker, neomycin resistance gene (pgkpr-neopA) cassette in the antisense orientation with respect to the Kera gene. The resulting plasmid was designated as pKera5′-pgk-Neo. A 1.6-kb KpnI fragment, which contains 0.6-kb exon 2 and 1.0-kb intron 2, was excised from the pKera-BR6.6 and inserted into pKera5′-pgkNeo digested with KpnI. Finally a negative selection marker gene, diphtheria toxin A fragment (pgkpr-Dta) cassette, was placed on the 3′ end of the targeting vector. Therefore, the Kera gene targeting vector, pKera-TV, contains a 3.1- and a 1.6-kb homologous sequence on 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The pKera-TV (80 μg) was linearized and transfected into an embryonic stem cell line (Duffy) via electroporation (250 microfarads and 800 V/cm). After 12 days of selection with Geneticin® (G418, 500 μg/ml), the G418-resistant colonies were individually picked and expanded. The homologous recombinant embryonic stem clones were identified by PCR-based analysis. PCR was carried out with the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Diagnostics). The primers used for 5′ PCR were as follows: kera-1, 5′-gatggcctagtcggccatcactgcaaagag-3′; kera-2, 5′-cacccagagtattaaacagtttggggttgc-3′; neo(+), 5′-cgcttcctcgtgctttacggtatcgccgctc-3′. The primers used for 3′ PCR were as follows: kera-3, 5′-gccacccagctgagatggatc-3′; kera-4, 5′-ggcttatgctgagaatgaagg-3′; pgkpr(–), 5′-cgagactagtgagacgtgct-3′. Amplification of the 5′ PCR product was performed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 7 min. Amplification of 3′ PCR product was identical except the extension time at 72 °C was 3 min. The blastocyst microinjection and chimeric mice production were performed by the gene targeting core facility at the University of Cincinnati. Immunohistochemistry—To examine keratocan and lumican expression, 5-μm paraffin sections were deparaffinized, blocked, and processed for indirect immunostaining using epitope-specific rabbit antibodies against synthetic mouse lumican (8 μg/ml) (14Saika S.

Single-stranded antisense and sense digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes of keratocan mRNA were generated by in vitro transcription using appropriate RNA polymerases (T7 for antisense and T3 for sense keratocan probes) at 37 °C for 2 h. The DNA templates were completely degraded by RQI RNase-free DNase I (Promega) at 37 °C for 15 min. The in vitro synthesized riboprobes were then partially degraded into 200–400 bases by incubating the specimens in 0.3 m NaHCO3, pH10.2, at 60 °C for 30 min. Finally the riboprobes were quantified by spectrophotometer, and 5 μg/ml was used for the hybridization. The mouse eyes and embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C and embedded in paraffin. The in situ hybridization was performed on paraffin sections (5 μm) mounted on Superfrost/Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific) as described previously (19Smith R.S. Zabeleta A. John S.W.M.

To remove nonspecifically bound probes, slides were subjected to a stringent wash with 0.5× SSC at 65 °C and treated with 20 μg/ml RNase (Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h followed by washing with 0.2× SSC at 65 °C. The hybridization signals were visualized with anti-digoxigenin antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugates using procedures recommended by Roche Diagnostics. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Corneas from keratocan-null and age-matched wild-type controls were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, with 8.0 mm CaCl2 for 2 h on ice. The corneas were dissected and postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. After dehydration in a graded ethanol series followed by propylene oxide, the corneas were infiltrated and imbedded in a mixture of Embed 812, nadic methyl anhydride, dodecenylsuccinic anhydride, and DMP-30 (EM Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). Thick sections (1 μm) were cut and stained with methylene blueazur blue for examination and selection of specific regions for further analysis. Thin sections were prepared using a Reichert UCT ultramicrotome and a diamond knife. Staining was with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate followed by 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 3.2. Sections were examined and photographed at 80 kV using a Hitachi 7000 transmission electron microscope. The microscope was calibrated using a line grating. Fibril Diameter Measurements—The cornea stroma was divided into two regions for analysis: anterior and posterior stroma. The anterior stroma was defined as the 10 μm subjacent to the epithelium, and the posterior stroma was defined as the 10 μm adjacent to Descemet's layer. Micrographs of appropriate regions were taken at 48,700× magnification. Calibrated micrographs from each region were randomly chosen in a masked manner. The micrographs were digitized, and diameters were measured using an R&M Biometrics-Bioquant (Memphis, TN) image analysis system. Statistical Methods—In the initial analyses of fibril diameter, the fibril diameter measurements from two mutant animals were analyzed separately, and no significant differences were observed between the two. Therefore, in the final analyses data from different animals were combined. The field-to-field variability and correlation among measurements from the same field were accounted for by fitting a linear mixed effect model. For all but 2 of 24 fields, the assumption of normal distribution was appropriate after excluding 4.5% of the outliers. We fit the mixed effect model twice, with and without the two fields in question, and obtained similar estimates and consistent p values. Therefore, the analysis based on the full data (excluding outliers) is reported. The number of fibrils measured was 348 and 352 for the anterior regions and 783 and 897 for the posterior regions. All analyses were performed using SAS, version 8.2, software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Accumulation of Sulfated KS-keratocan in Cornea during the 1st and 2nd Week after Birth—To characterize keratocan protein expression in the wild-type mice, corneas were obtained from day 1, 7, and 14 mice. The keratocan core protein was detected by SDS-PAGE Western blotting analyses with antibodies against an N-terminal peptide of mouse keratocan just after the signal peptide (Fig. 1). Keratocan migrated as 70–80-kDa bands in undigested samples (Fig. 1, U). Digestion of the corneal extract with endo-β-galactosidase to remove the keratan sulfate chains reduced keratocan to its core protein of ∼50 kDa (Fig. 1, D). There is very little KS-keratocan present in cornea of mice at postnatal day 1 and a marked increase in both the amount and size of KS-keratocan in corneas of mice between postnatal day 7 and day 14, a period in which the eye opens in mice. Generation of Keratocan Gene-targeted Mutation in Mice—To examine the biological function of keratocan in vivo, we generated keratocan knockout (Kera-KO) mice via standard gene targeting. To ensure Kera-KO mice reveal keratocan-null background, we deleted the majority of exon 2, which contains the translation initiation codon, and replaced it with pgkpr-neopA cassette in the antisense orientation with respect to the Kera gene (Fig. 2, A–C). The genotypes of the Kera-KO mice were determined by PCR with specific primer sets designed for differentiating the wild-type from the mutant allele at both 5′ and 3′ ends (Fig. 2, D–E). Among 324 G418-resistant embryonic stem cell clones, three independently targeted heterozygous embryonic stem cell clones were identified and then injected into B6 blastocysts. Germ line transmission from each clone was obtained, and no differences were observed among different lines. Analyses of Keratocan Knockout Mice—The Kera-KO mice are viable and fertile without any apparent abnormal phenotypes such as hazy cornea at the age of 4 weeks. In situ hybridization analyses showed that keratocan mRNA was completely undetectable in the Kera-KO cornea, whereas the lumican mRNA expression level showed no difference between the wild-type and the Kera-KO corneas (Fig. 3). Likewise the keratocan protein was completely missing as judged by an immunohistochemical staining (data not shown). As shown by the light microscopic picture (Fig. 3), the cornea-iris angle of the anterior segment was 30–40% narrower, and the corneal stroma was 40% thinner in the Kera–/– as compared with the wild-type littermates. Western blotting analyses of the corneal extracts from 1-month-old animals also demonstrated that no keratocan protein could be detected in the Kera-KO mice indicating Kera-KO revealed a keratocan-null background (Fig. 4). The expression of lumican, fibromodulin, and decorin in the Kera-KO cornea as determined by Western blotting analyses showed no significant alterations between the wild-type and the Kera-KO corneas (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Decorin and fibromodulin expression have not been altered in the Kera–/– cornea. 10 μg of 4 m guanidine-HCl protein extract was subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%). Western blotting analyses were performed with affinity-purified and epitope-specific antibody against decorin (Dcn) (lanes 1–8) or fibromodulin (Fbn) (lanes 9–16). It was convincing that, in the Kera–/– cornea, neither decorin nor fibromodulin was changed. U, undigested sample; D, endo-β-galactosidase-digested sample.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ultrastructural Analysis—The corneal stromata from keratocan-deficient and wild-type 7.5-month-old mice were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy. Since the lumican-deficient mouse had a spatially restricted phenotype in the corneal stroma (13Chakravarti S. Petroll W.M. Hassell J.R. Jester J.V. Lass J.H. Paul J. Birk D.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 11: 3365-3373Google Scholar), the anterior and posterior stromata were analyzed separately. Qualitatively there were consistent differences between the keratocan-deficient and wild-type stromata (Fig. 6). First, the collagen fibrils were larger in keratocan-deficient stromata. Second, there was less regular fibril packing in the deficient stromata. This was true throughout the stroma with no apparent differences between anterior and posterior stroma. The collagen fibrils in the keratocan-deficient stromata had regular, circular profiles characteristic of normal fibrils (Fig. 6). This was true for fibrils in both the anterior and posterior stroma. However, fibril diameters in both regions were larger in the mutant animals. Examination of the frequency distributions of collagen fibril diameters from wild-type and homozygous mutant mice indicates that mutant mice have significantly larger diameters in both the anterior and posterior regions of the cornea than the wild-type mice (Fig. 7). Both the wild-type and mutant animals had a normal distribution of fibril diameters. There were no obvious populations of fibrils that were significantly different from the wild-type controls in either anterior or posterior regions of the mutant corneas. However, the distributions in both anterior and posterior regions of the mutant stromata showed a significant shift to larger diameters compared with the wild-type controls. The anterior fibrils had a mean diameter of 26.6 nm in the wild-type versus 30.7 nm in the keratocan-deficient stromata. This difference of 4.1 nm (95% confidence interval: 1.7, 6.7) was significant (p = 0.01). Likewise in the posterior stroma, fibrils had a mean diameter of 26.9 nm in the wild-type versus 32.0 nm in the mutant stromata. This difference of 5.1 nm (95% confidence interval: 3.8, 6.3) also was significant (p < 0.001). There was no statistical difference between anterior and posterior regions in the normal stromata; however, in the keratocan-deficient stromata the difference between anterior and posterior (1.2 nm 95% confidence interval: 0.3, 2.2) is significant (p = 0.02), suggesting that the posterior region may be affected to a greater degree by the keratocan deficiency.Fig. 7Morphometric analysis of corneal collagen fibrils. The distributions of collagen fibril diameters were analyzed in the anterior (A and C) and posterior (B and D) cornea of 7.5-month-old wild-type Kera+/+ (A and B) and homozygous mutant Kera–/– (C and D) littermates. The mean diameter values for the Kera–/– and the wild-type controls are indicated. The mean fibril diameter and the 95% confidence interval (CI) are indicated in each histogram.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In mice, eyelids are closed at birth and open in the 2nd week of postnatal age. We observed that the increase of protein level of keratocan during the 2nd postnatal week of the mouse coincided with the opening of the eye at this stage (Fig. 1). However, the maximum accumulation of keratocan protein in the cornea does not correspond with the peak of keratocan mRNA (16Liu C.-Y. Shiraishi A Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Funderburgh J.L. Corpuz L.M.

It is likely that the synthesis of keratocan may be regulated at translational and/or post-translational levels. This phenomenon has also been found in lumican (18Ying S. Shiraishi A. Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Funderburgh J.L. Swiergiel J. Roth M.R. Conrad G.W. Kao W.W.-Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1983; 258: 7779-7787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neural crest cells are important to the morphogeneses of various tissues during embryonic development. In ocular tissues, neural crest cells contribute to corneal stroma, iris, and eyelid mesenchyme. We have showed previously that keratocan expression is restricted to the keratocytes after embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5), but it is also transiently expressed by different sublineages of neural crest cells in several non-ocular tissues such as snout, ear, limb, and diaphragm during E13.5–E16.5. Keratocan knockout mice are viable and fertile, indicating that keratocan is dispensable in tissues that transiently express Kera during embryonic development. The expression levels of other SLRP members including lumican, decorin, and fibromodulin were not altered in the Kera–/– cornea as compared with that of the wild-type littermates, suggesting that the phenotypic changes observed in the Kera–/– mice resulted exclusively from the loss of function of Kera. Genetic evidence has shown that mice lacking a transcription factor, Lmx1b, decrease keratocan mRNA synthesis and exhibit abnormal corneal collagen fiber morphology at E15.5 (21Pressman C.L. Chen H. Johnson R.L. Genesis. 2000; 26: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, we did not find any significant alteration in collagenous matrix of the Kera–/– cornea at this stage (data not shown). The discrepancy of our data from the Lmx1b knockout mice is not known, but it is likely that ablation of Lmx1b actually may perturb the expression of genes other than Kera that are involved in collagen fibrillogenesis. The corneas among keratocan, lumican, and mimecan/osteoglycin knockout mice show different but overlapping phenotypes. Lumican knockout mice have the most severe phenotypes with age-related corneal opacity, disorganized collagen fibrils, and thinner corneal stroma (12Charkravarti S. Magnuson T. Lass J.H. Jepsen K.J. LaMantia C. Carroll H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 112: 987-996Google Scholar, 13Chakravarti S. Petroll W.M. Hassell J.R. Jester J.V. Lass J.H. Paul J. Birk D.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2607-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Mimecan/osteoglycin knockout mice have slightly larger but uniform collagen fibrils with transparent cornea (22Tasheva E.S. Koester A. Paulsen A.Q. Garrett A.S. Boyle D.L. Davidson H.J. Song M. Fox N. Conrad G.W. Mol. Vis. 2002; 8: 407-415PubMed Google Scholar). Keratocan knockout mice also reveal larger diameters of corneal collagen fibers but less organized packing. However, like lumican-deficient mice, keratocan-null mice have a thinner corneal stroma and a narrower cornea-iris angle. Although the keratocan expression level is comparable to lumican in the corneal stroma, keratocan does not complement lumican functions and alleviate the corneal phenotype observed in the lumican-null mice. This result suggested that keratocan and lumican might bind to different sites of collagen fibril. The reduced thickness of corneal stroma seen in the keratocan-null mice was likely due to reduced hydration caused by a decrease of keratan sulfate proteoglycan content in Kera–/– cornea. Mimecan/osteoglycin expression level is the lowest in the cornea as compared with keratocan and lumican. Although lumican, keratocan, and mimecan/osteoglycin have been known to be corneal KS-SLRPs in various species including human, bovine, and chick, it has been shown that, unlike lumican and keratocan, mimecan has no KS chain in mouse cornea. This may explain the subtle phenotypes observed in the cornea of mimecan knockout mice. Human corneal plana (CNA2) is an autosomal recessive inherited disease that is directly linked to the mutation of KERA. So far at least three mutations have been identified. Forty-six Finnish patients are homozygous for a founder having AAC to AGC transition at codon 247 predicting an amino acid change from Asn to Ser. This amino acid substitution affects the Asn residue in the tandem leucine-rich repeat consensus motif (LXXLXLXXNXL) (15Pellegata N.S. Dieguez-Lucena J.L. Joensuu T. Lau S. Montgomery K.T. Krahe R. Kivela T. Kucherlapati R. Forsius H. de la Chapelle A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Four affected Bangladesh patients are homozygous of sequence change from ACA to AAA at codon 215, which results in an amino acid change from Thr to Lys in the linker region between the sixth and seventh tandem leucine-rich repeat motif (23Lehmann O.J. El-ashry M.F. Ebenezer N.D. Ocakam L. Francis P.J. Wilkie S.E. Patel R.J. Ficker L. Jordan T. Khaw P.T. Bhattacharya S.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 42: 3118-3122Google Scholar). In an American CNA2 patient of Chinese origin, a homozygous CAG to TAG transversion was found in exon 2 that causes a change of Gln to a stop codon, predicting a truncated protein of 173 amino acids (15Pellegata N.S. Dieguez-Lucena J.L. Joensuu T. Lau S. Montgomery K.T. Krahe R. Kivela T. Kucherlapati R. Forsius H. de la Chapelle A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is likely that all these mutations will yield a mutant keratocan gene product that may be quickly degraded in the cornea because they do not exhibit a dominant negative effect in a heterozygous mutant. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice harboring recombinant human KERA cDNA (wild type or mutants) bred into a mouse with Kera-null background would become an ideal model to investigate the structure-function relationship of keratocan in vivo.

Our results indicate that DIM exhibits potent antiproliferative and antiandrogenic properties in androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cells. DIM suppresses cell proliferation of LNCaP cells and inhibits dihydrotestosterone (DHT) stimulation of DNA synthesis. These activities were not produced in androgen-independent PC-3 cells. Moreover, DIM inhibited endogenous PSA transcription and reduced intracellular and secreted PSA protein levels induced by DHT in LNCaP cells. Also, DIM inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, the DHT-induced expression of a prostate-specific antigen promoter-regulated reporter gene construct in transiently transfected LNCaP cells. Similar effects of DIM were observed in PC-3 cells only when these cells were co-transfected with a wild-type androgen receptor expression plasmid. Using fluorescence imaging with green fluorescent protein androgen receptor and Western blot analysis, we demonstrated that DIM inhibited androgen-induced androgen receptor (AR) translocation into the nucleus. Results of receptor binding assays indicated further that DIM is a strong competitive inhibitor of DHT binding to the AR. Results of structural modeling studies showed that DIM is remarkably similar in conformational geometry and surface charge distribution to an established synthetic AR antagonist, although the atomic compositions of the two substances are quite different. Taken together with our published reports of the estrogen agonist activities of DIM, the present results establish DIM as a unique bifunctional hormone disrupter.

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in American men, with more than 40,000 deaths in 1997 (1Wingo P.A. Landis S. Ries L.A. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 1997; 47: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). One of every four cancers diagnosed is of prostatic origin, making prostate cancer the most commonly diagnosed cancer (2Small E.J. Drugs Aging. 1998; 13: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although the incidence of prostate cancer in Japanese and Chinese men is remarkably low compared with the incidence in American males, after migration to the US, the risk of later generations of Asian immigrants rises to levels that are similar to American males (3Shimizu H.

The differences in prostate cancer diagnosed among various population groups suggest that factors in the environment, lifestyles, and diet play a role in prostate cancer initiation and/or progression. One possible contributor to the lower prostate cancer rates in Asian men is the higher consumption of phytochemical-rich vegetables that is typical of this population (5Denis L. Morton M.S.

The cancer-preventive effects of DIM, especially on hormone-mediated breast cancer, and the effects of indole-3-carbinol on prostate cancer cells led us to investigate the effects and mechanism of action of DIM against proliferation of prostate tumor cells. To examine the androgen antagonist effects of DIM, we conducted a series of cell proliferation and gene activation studies in androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (PC-3) human prostate cancer cell lines. LNCaP cells were derived from lymph node metastasis, and PC-3 cells were derived from bone metastasis (22Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Trapman J.

We found that DIM is a strong antiandrogen that inhibited androgen-dependent tumor cell growth and competitively inhibited androgen receptor translocation and signal transduction. In addition, DIM down-regulated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression at the transcriptional level. Results from androgen receptor (AR) competitive binding assays, nuclear translocation studies, and structural modeling computations suggest that DIM disrupts AR function in a manner similar to a chemically dissimilar synthetic antiandrogen, Casodex.

Aliquots were diluted 50-fold in Isoton II (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL), and 200-μl duplicates were counted in a model Z1 Coulter particle counter and averaged. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—LNCaP cells were plated onto 24-well plates (Corning) with 2 × 104 cells/well and treated with varying concentrations of DIM with and without 1 nm DHT for 24–48 h. [3H]Thymidine (3 μCi) was then added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 2–3 h. Medium was removed, and the cells were washed 3 times with 2 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by the addition of 300 μl of 0.3 n NaOH to each well and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Aliquots (150 μl) were transferred into the scintillation vials with 4 ml of ScintiVerse BD scintillation fluid (Fisher) and counted for radioactivity by a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Plasmid Reporters and Expression Vectors—The ARE-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid, pPSA-630 luciferase (pPSA-Luc), was a gift from Dr. M. D. Sadar (29Sato N. Sadar M.D. Bruchovsky N.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17485-17494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). pPSA-Luc contains the PSA promoter region (-630 to 12) with three AREs, all of which are critical to the activity of the pPSA-Luc promoter. The MMTV-Luc, containing one consensus ARE, and the expression vector, pCMV-hAR, which constitutively expresses a fully functional human androgen receptor, were also generously provided by Dr. M. D. Sadar. The pCMV-GFP-rAR was a gift from Dr. A. K. Roy (30Roy A.K. Tyagi R.K. Song C.S. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Oh T.S. Chatterjee B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 949: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). RNA Extraction, mRNA Purification, and Northern Hybridization— mRNA isolation and Northern blot analyses were conducted as described previously (20Hong C. Kim H.A. Firestone G.L. Bjeldanes L.F. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1297-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 31Riby J.E. Feng C. Chang Y.C. Schaldach C.M. Firestone G.L. Bjeldanes L.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PSA cDNA was generously provided by Dr. M. D. Sadar, and the cDNA probes were biotinylated using NEBlot Phototope kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), purified via precipitation with 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and washed with 70% ethanol. After hybridization with cDNA probes, the membrane was incubated with streptavidin then biotinylated with alkaline phosphatase followed by the Phototope-CDP-Star assay (New England Biolabs) and autoradiographed. The amount of mRNA was quantified by Gel Densitometer (Bio-Rad) and normalized with β-actin as an internal control. Analysis of Intracellular and Secreted PSA—LNCaP cells growing on 100-mm plates were treated as indicated for 24 h. Cells were lysed as previously described (20Hong C. Kim H.A. Firestone G.L. Bjeldanes L.F. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1297-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) for intracellular PSA analysis. For secreted proteins, spent medium was collected and concentrated 18-fold using Millipore Centriprep YM-10 following the manufacturer's protocol (Bedford, MA). Protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were added, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated with 3 μg/ml monoclonal free PSA antibody (Biodesign International) for 2 h and co-immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) on a rotator. The samples were then subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously (20Hong C. Kim H.A. Firestone G.L. Bjeldanes L.F. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1297-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) using a monoclonal PSA (sc-7316) primary antibody and a goat anti-mouse-IgG-AP secondary antibody (sc-2008) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Transient Transfections with Reporters and Luciferase Assay—LNCaP and PC-3 cells were transfected with some modifications, as previously described (20Hong C. Kim H.A. Firestone G.L. Bjeldanes L.F. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1297-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For AR transactivation, cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of MMTV-Luc or pPSA-Luc per plate. Co-transfection experiments with pCMV-hAR or pCMV-GFP-rAR, 0.1 μg/plate, was also used. For experiments involving GFP fluorescence imaging, treatments were not added until 30 h after transfection. Hormone Binding Assay—LNCaP cells were grown in 5% DCC-FBS-DMEM medium supplemented with 4.0 g/liter glucose and 3.7 g/liter sodium bicarbonate and harvested in Hepes-buffered saline containing 1.5 mm EDTA by scraping with a rubber policeman. The cells were placed on ice, collected by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold TKEG buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol) and resuspended in 250 μl/plate homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol). Cells were homogenized using a Polytron apparatus at medium speed for 1 min on ice. The homogenates were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm in 4 °C for 60 min. The supernatant solution was divided into 1.0-ml aliquots, quickly frozen in a dry-ice/ethanol bath, and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. For each competitive binding assay, 5 μl of 20 nm [3H]DHT in 50% ethanol, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol was placed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Competitive ligands were added as 1.0 μl of 100× solution in Me2SO. After mixing, 95 μl of either LNCaP cell extracts or recombinant AR protein (PanVera, Madison, WI) was added, and the solutions were vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 2–3 h. Proteins were precipitated by the addition of 100 μl of 50% hydroxylapatite slurry equilibrated in TE (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) and incubated on ice for 15 min with vortexing every 5 min to resuspend the hydroxylapatite. The pellet was washed with 1.0 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl) and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully aspirated, and the pellet was washed 2 more times with 1.0 ml of wash buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of ethanol and transferred to a scintillation vial. The tube was washed with another 200 μl of ethanol, which was then added to the same counting vial. A negative control contained no protein, and nonspecific binding was determined using 100-fold (0.1 μm) excess unlabeled DHT. Subcellular Fractionation—Three near confluent (80–90%) cultures of LNCaP cells in 100-mm Petri dishes were used for each treatment. Treatments were added as 1 μl of a 1,000-fold concentrated solution of DIM in Me2SO/ml of medium for the indicated time. After incubation with treatments at 37 °C, cytosolic and nuclear proteins were prepared as described (32Hong C. Firestone G.L. Bjeldanes L.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 33Riby J.E. Chang G.H. Firestone G.L. Bjeldanes L.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) and harvested in MDH buffer (3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). After homogenization, supernatant was saved for cytosolic proteins, and nuclear proteins were extracted from the pellets using MDHK buffer (3 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m KCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) followed by HDK buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 m KCl). Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were subsequently analyzed by Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—After the indicated treatment, Western immunoblot analyses of androgen receptor from LNCaP cells were performed as described previously (20Hong C. Kim H.A. Firestone G.L. Bjeldanes L.F. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1297-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In short, polyclonal AR antibodies, sc-816 and sc-815, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used as primary antibodies with a chemiluminescence protein detection method. Blotted membranes were stained with Coomassie Blue to determine protein loading, or β-actin (sc-8432, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as an internal control. The amount of protein was quantified by Gel Densitometer (Bio-Rad) and normalized with β-actin when used as an internal control. Fluorescence Imaging—PC-3 cells were plated on cover slips in 6-well culture plates at 1.5 × 105 cells/well in 5% DCC-FBS-DMEM medium. Cells were co-transfected with pCMV-GFP-rAR and pPSA-Luc or MMTV-Luc as indicated above. Cover slips were placed on microscope slides, and images were taken at 1000×. Fluorescence imaging of GFP was performed using a Zeiss Axiophot 381 and Q-imaging MicroPublisher at the College of Natural Resources Biological Imaging Facility of the University of California, Berkeley, CA. Modeling of DIM Binding to the AR Ligand Binding Domain— Quantum mechanical geometry optimizations were performed at a high level of theory, 6–31G**/MP2, for DHT, DIM, Casodex, and R1881. Using these molecular coordinates, a solvent-accessible surface was constructed surrounding each molecule; such a surface enables coupling of the ab initio electronic structure calculations to the solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (34Wilson W.D. Schaldach C.M. Bourcier W.L. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1997; 267: 431-437Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The coupling was accomplished through the single and double layers of charge at the boundary and allowed for relaxation of the quantum electronic charge distribution in response to these surrounding layers. This first principles approach eliminated the need to assign fractional charges to the atoms. The induced polarization charge at the interface was then mapped onto the nodes (“dots”) of the elements of the solvent accessible surface. A comparison was then made between these molecules. The atomic configuration of DHT determined experimentally, i.e. obtained from the crystal structure of the molecule in the androgen receptor, provided a template for comparison of the feasibility of the androgen receptor binding a different ligand (35Sack J.S. Kish K.F. Wang C. Attar R.M. Kiefer S.E. An Y. Wu G.Y. Scheffler J.E. Salvati M.E. Krystek S.R.J. Weinmann R. Enspahr H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4904-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We, therefore, again constructed a solvent-accessible surface, SR, surrounding the DHT molecule (crystal structure) and used this surface as a reference “standard” or template for the androgen receptor's ligand binding site. The center-of-mass of each androgen receptor ligand, DHT, Casodex, R1881 (optimized coordinates), and DIM, was translated to the center-of-mass of the template (crystal structure coordinates) and then rotated about the x, y, and z axes through the center-of-mass. We calculated the fractional surface area of the ligand, which did not fit into the binding site template, as follows. For each element, i, of the ligand surface, SL, we then found its nearest neighbor element j on SR, allowing us to form the vector rij = ri-rj from element j (nearest neighbor to i of SL) on SR to element i. By forming the dot product of rij with the normal to the element at j on SR, rij × nj, we could determine whether element i of SL is inside or outside of SR. In this way we calculated a ΔSL, the fractional surface area of each ligand that lies outside the template DHT surface SR. This method was repeated using the crystal structure of R1881 as the binding site template (36Matias P.M. Donner P. Coelho R. Thomaz M. Peixoto C. Macedo S. Otto N. Joschko S. Scholz P. Wegg A.

DIM Inhibits the Proliferation and DNA Synthesis of Uninduced and DHT-induced LNCaP Cells—The effects of DIM on human prostate cancer cell growth were examined using LNCaP and PC-3 cells. After a 96-h treatment, DIM produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of LNCaP cell proliferation with maximal inhibition of 70% at 50 μm. At these concentrations, DIM had no observable effects on the growth of PC-3 cells (Fig. 1A). In addition, we examined the effects of varying concentrations of DIM with and without 1 nm DHT on DNA synthesis in LNCaP cells (Fig. 1B). Our results showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis of these cells of up to 90% under both uninduced and androgen-induced growth conditions. Inhibition of Endogenous PSA Expression by DIM—Northern blot analysis was used to examine the effect of DIM on endogenous PSA gene expression. Fig. 2 shows concentration-dependent (A) and time-dependent (B) decreases of up to 70% in PSA mRNA levels after DIM treatments. In addition, PSA mRNA induction by DHT with increasing time of treatment was inhibited by up to 80% by 24 h of co-treatment with DIM (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, Western immunoblot analysis showed that DIM reduced levels of intracellular and secreted PSA protein to background concentrations (Figs. 3, A and B) after DHT co-treatments. The reduction of PSA expression was comparable with the reduction in DHT-induced mRNA expression determined by Northern blot analysis. These results are consistent with DIM regulation of PSA expression occurring at the transcriptional level and consistent with the antiandrogenic activity of DIM observed in the cell proliferation experiments.Fig. 3DIM inhibits expression of secreted and intracellular PSA protein.A, Western blot analysis of intracellular PSA protein level in cells treated with Me2SO (DMSO) control and 50 μm DIM in the presence and absence of 1 nm DHT. B, DHT (1 nm) induced the expression of secreted PSA, and co-treatment with 50 μm DIM inhibited the expression of the secreted protein. Coomassie Blue staining was used to verify equal protein loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DIM Down-regulates the Activities of DHT-induced Reporter Genes—The antiandrogenic effects of DIM were further examined with reporter assays using a MMTV-Luc promoter construct that contains one ARE and a pPSA-Luc promoter construct containing three AREs. These plasmids were transiently transfected into LNCaP cells and, by luciferase analysis, showed that DIM strongly inhibited DHT induction of androgen-responsive genes by more than 50% at 1 μm and more than 90% at 10 μm in both promoter constructs (Fig. 4, A and B). Treatment with DIM alone failed to induce transactivation of these reporter genes. These results further confirm that DIM inhibition of AR-responsive gene expression occurs at the transcriptional level. The AR Is the Central Modulator of DIM Inhibitory Effects on Androgen-regulated Gene Expression—To confirm the importance of the AR in the transcriptional activation of the ARE promoters, we employed PC-3 cells, which exhibit little or no AR expression. We transfected these cells with the pPSA-Luc promoter and performed luciferase analysis to show that without co-transfection of an AR expression vector, DIM has no effect (data not shown). In contrast, co-transfection of an AR expression vector with the pPSA-Luc reporter construct led to a concentration-dependent inhibition of DHT-induced transactivation by DIM that was similar to the effect we had observed in LNCaP cells (Fig. 5). The same results were seen with the MMTV-Luc promoter (data not shown). Moreover, DIM by itself did not induce transactivation of these reporter genes in either cell line with or without co-transfection of the wild-type androgen receptor. DIM Competes with Androgen for Binding to the AR in LNCaP Cells and in Recombinant AR Protein—Because our results strongly implicate the AR as the focus of the DIM mode of action in prostate cells, we assessed directly the ability of DIM to bind to this receptor. Our results of competitive binding assays with both the mutant AR of LNCaP cells and a wild-type recombinant human AR demonstrate that DIM, in the micro-molar concentration range, competes with labeled DHT for binding to the AR (Fig. 6). Cyproterone acetate and Casodex, two well known antiandrogens, were used as positive controls. DIM and Casodex exhibited similar binding affinity for the AR. Biochemical Ana"

In this study, we isolated JIP-1b, a JNK signaling scaffold protein, as a binding protein of APP, and analyzed the roles of JIP-1b in APP phosphorylation by JNK and the association of kinesin light chain 1 with APP. APP phosphorylation at threonine 668 by JNK was enhanced on the JIP-1b scaffold in vitro and in cultured cells exogenously expressing APP. APP phosphorylation in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells was mediated by activation of JNK signaling. JIP-1b also enhanced the association of kinesin light chain 1 with APP. Our results suggest that JIP-1b may function as a protein linking the kinesin-I motor protein to the cargo receptor, APP, and that the JNK signaling pathway may regulate the phosphorylation of this cargo protein through the JIP-1b scaffold.

The deposition of amyloid plaque is a principal pathological feature in the brain parenchyma and blood vessel walls of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The major components of amyloid plaque are β-amyloid (Aβ) 1The abbreviations used are: Aβ, β-amyloid; APP, amyloid precursor protein; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; KLC, kinesin light chain; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; JIP, JNK interacting protein; MKK7, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7; MLK3, mixed lineage kinase 3; GST, glutathione S-transferase; JBD, JNK-binding domain; SH3, Src homology 3; PID, phosphotyrosine interacting domain; KB, kinesin binding; AICD, APP intracellular domain; HA, hemagglutinin; NGF, nerve growth factor; APPC, cytoplasmic region of APP. peptides, including Aβ40 and Aβ42, which are derived by proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) (for a review see Ref. 1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). APP is a type I membrane spanning protein. Three major isoforms of APP comprising 695, 751, and 770 amino acids are generated by alternative splicing. Enzymes termed β- and γ-secretase cleave APP to form the amino and carboxyl termini of the Aβ peptides. Besides its pathological role in Alzheimer's disease, APP is thought to be functionally important because mice lacking all APP family genes die in the early postnatal period (2Heber S. Herms J. Gajic V. Hainfellner J. Aguzzi A. Rulicke T. von Kretzschmar H. von Koch C. Sisodia S. Tremml P. Lipp H.P. Wolfer D.P. Muller U. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7951-7963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although numerous studies have shown various roles of APP, the physiological function of APP is not yet clear. In neurons, APP is transported within axons by the fast anterograde axonal transport system from cell bodies to nerve terminals (3Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Hoffman P.N. Perry G. Price D.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3136-3142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When expression of the kinesin heavy chain is inhibited with antisense oligonucleotides, axonal transport of APP is disturbed in cultured hippocampal neurons, suggesting that axonal transport of APP requires the motor protein kinesin-I (4Ferreira A. Caceres A. Kosik K.S. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3112-3123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that APP may function as a cargo receptor for kinesin-I. APP forms a complex with kinesin-I by binding directly to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of the kinesin light chain (KLC) subunit (5Kamal A. Stokin G.B. Yang Z. Xia C.-H. Goldstein L.S.B. Neuron. 2000; 28: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Neuronal overexpression or deletion of APPL, the Drosophila functional homolog of APP, disrupt axonal transport in Drosophila (6Torroja L. Chu H. Kotovsky I. White K. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 489-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 7Gunawardena S. Goldstein L.S.B. Neuron. 2001; 32: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the fast anterograde axonal transport of β-secretase and presenilin-1 is mediated by APP and kinesin-I, and processing of APP to Aβ by secretases can occur in an axonal membrane compartment transported by kinesin-I (8Kamal A. Almenar-Queralt A. LeBlanc J.F. Roberts E.A. Goldstein L.S.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). APP is a phosphorylated protein and one known phosphorylation site is threonine 668 (Thr668) (numbering for the APP695 isoform) within the cytoplasmic region of APP (9Suzuki T. Oishi M. Marshak D.M. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1114-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Constitutive phosphorylation of APP is observed at Thr668 specifically in neurons. Phosphorylation of APP appears to regulate its function and localization (10Ando K. Oishi M. Takeda S. Iijima K. Isohara T. Nairn A.C. Kirino Y. Greengard P. Suzuki T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to elucidate the mechanism of APP phosphorylation. Several kinases were reported to phosphorylate Thr668 of APP. Cdc2 kinase phosphorylates the Thr668 during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (9Suzuki T. Oishi M. Marshak D.M. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1114-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thr668 of APP is phosphorylated in adult rat brain and in differentiated PC12 cells (10Ando K. Oishi M. Takeda S. Iijima K. Isohara T. Nairn A.C. Kirino Y. Greengard P. Suzuki T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this phosphorylation is mediated by Cdk5, a neuronal homolog of Cdc2 kinase (11Iijima K. Ando K. Takeda S. Satoh Y. Seki T. Itohara S. Greengard P. Kirino Y. Nairn A.C. Suzuki T. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Glycogen synthase kinase-3β also phosphorylates Thr668 of APP in vitro (12Aplin A.E. Gibb G.M. Jacobsen J.S. Gallo J.-M. Anderton B.H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that APP is more efficiently phosphorylated at Thr668 by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-3 (JNK-3) than by Cdk5 or glycogen synthase kinase-3β in vitro (13Standen C.L. Brownlees J. Grierson A.J. Kesavapany S. Lau K-F. McLoughlin D.M. Miller C.C.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether JNK-3 phosphorylates APP in neurons. In this study, we isolated human JNK interacting protein-1b (JIP-1b) as a novel molecule interacting with the cytoplasmic region of APP. Although JIP-1b was originally isolated as a cytoplasmic inhibitor of the JNK signal transduction pathway (14Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), a subsequent study revealed that JIP-1b is a scaffold protein that interacts with specific multiple components of the JNK pathway namely JNK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7), and mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) (15Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). JNK is activated in cells treated with inflammatory cytokines or in cells exposed to environmental stress (for a review see Ref. 16Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). Although the main targets of the JNK pathway include the transcription factor c-Jun, ATF2, and Elk-1, JNK-3 also induces robust phosphorylation of Thr668 in the cytoplasmic region of APP (13Standen C.L. Brownlees J. Grierson A.J. Kesavapany S. Lau K-F. McLoughlin D.M. Miller C.C.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, JIP-1b could recruit JNK to APP and in turn enhance the phosphorylation of APP by JNK. Moreover, JIP-1b was identified as a binding partner of the TPR domain of KLC, and was suggested to be a scaffold protein linking the kinesin-I motor protein to its membrane cargo (17Verhey K.J. Meyer D. Deehan R. Blenis J. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Thus, APP could associate with kinesin-I via JIP-1b. In this study, we further examined whether JIP-1b functions as a scaffold protein for the association of APP with JNK and KLC1. Our results demonstrate that APP associates with JNK and KLC1 on the JIP-1b scaffold, and that APP phosphorylation by JNK is enhanced by the association of APP with JIP-1b. These results suggest that JIP-1b may function as a linker protein of the kinesin-I motor protein to the cargo receptor, APP, and that the JNK signaling pathway may regulate the phosphorylation of the cargo protein through the JIP-1b scaffold. Expression Plasmids—To construct expression vectors (pcDNA/HA and pcDNA/FLAG) with the HA tag or FLAG tag sequence, oligonucleotide fragments encoding HA or FLAG were inserted into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Expression vectors encoding the HA-tagged or FLAG-tagged proteins were constructed by inserting cDNAs into pcDNA/HA or pcDNA/FLAG. Expression vectors encoding the HA-tagged JNK1 and GST-c-Jun were described previously (18Nakano K. Yamauchi J. Nakagawa K. Itoh H. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20533-20539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). APP cDNA and MLK3 cDNA were obtained by PCR using oligonucleotide primers and human brain Marathon-Ready™ cDNA (Clontech). MKK7 cDNA and KLC1 cDNA were kindly provided by Dr. J. Yamauchi (Nara Institute of Science and Technology) and Dr. A. Armin (McGill University), respectively. Deletion and point mutants were constructed with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Antibodies—To prepare a polyclonal anti-JIP-1b antibody, the human JIP-1b cDNA (amino acid residues 162–433) was inserted into the pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) was then expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified. Rabbits were immunized with the purified protein, and the antiserum (anti-JIP-1b) was raised. Anti-APP antibodies, UT18 and G369, were previously described (19Ando K. Iijima K. Elliott J.I. Kirino Y.

The anti-FLAG (M2) and anti-β-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Sigma, the anti-HA antibody (3F10) from Roche Diagnostics, the anti-APP antibody (6E10) from Signet, the anti-JNK1 antibody from Pharmingen, and the anti-phospho-c-Jun and anti-phospho-APP antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—To isolate cDNA clones encoding APP-interacting proteins, yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as previously described (21Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A human brain cDNA library inserted down-stream of the Ga14 DNA activation domain in the pACT2 vector was obtained from Clontech. The bait plasmid and library were co-transformed into yeast (L40 strain). Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. PC12 cells were cultured on collagen-coated dishes in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 1% nonessential amino acids. Neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells was induced by NGF (50 ng/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% horse serum and 1% non-essential amino acids (differentiation medium). Transfection—HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmid expression vectors using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). For transfection of the HA-tagged JNK binding domain (JBD) expression vector into PC12 cells, the cells were plated in a 12-well dish at 5 × 105 cells per well. At 24 h after plating, the cells were transfected with 1.6 μg of plasmid per well by the LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). At 6 h after transfection, the cells were replated on collagen-coated cover-slips and cultured in differentiation medium. At 72 h later, the cells were fixed and subjected to immunofluorescence staining. Transfection of the HA-tagged MLK3 expression vector into PC12 cells was performed as described previously (22Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). At 4 to 5 days after NGF treatment, PC12 cells were transfected with 1.6 μg of plasmid per well in a 12-well dish by LipofectAMINE 2000. At 6 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing NGF, and 24 h later, the cells were subjected to immunofluorescence staining. Assay for in Vitro Binding to Immobilized GST Fusion Proteins (GST Pull-down)—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). The cell lysate was incubated with purified GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads at 4 °C. After the beads were washed three times with washing buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), the binding proteins were released by boiling in 2× sample buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.5, 1% SDS, 1% mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol), and then separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, before being analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (21Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In Vitro Phosphorylation of APP—To prepare purified JIP-1b proteins, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged JIP-1b proteins. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in kinase lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm EGTA). The cell lysate was incubated with an anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C. The binding JIP-1b proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma), and concentrated with CENTRICON (Millipore) in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm EGTA). The amount of each JIP-1b protein was measured by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The GST-fused cytoplasmic region of APP (APPC) proteins was expressed in E. coli using the pGEX vector and purified by glutathione 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). To prepare activated JNK, HEK293 cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding HA-tagged JNK. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with anisomycin (30 μg/ml) for 30 min. The cells were then lysed in kinase lysis buffer. The cell lysate was incubated with an anti-HA antibody at 4 °C, and after the addition of protein G beads the mixture was incubated at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated and then washed twice with kinase lysis buffer and twice with reaction buffer. The precipitates were incubated in 30 μl of reaction buffer containing 18 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 5 μg of GST-APPC, or its mutants with purified JIP-1b or its mutants for 25 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer, and the mixture was heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE. The radioactivity incorporated into APPC and JIP-1b was detected by autoradiography. Immunofluorescence Staining—PC12 cells were cultured on collagen-coated glass coverslips and treated with NGF (50 ng/ml). The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% sucrose for 10 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. The cells were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, followed by an incubation with Alexa-488- or Alexa-594-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Cells were examined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Binding of the COOH-terminal Cytoplasmic Region in APP to JIP-1b—To isolate cDNA clones encoding APP-interacting proteins, we screened a human brain cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system. We inserted a cDNA fragment encoding the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic region (amino acid 649–695) of human APP into a pBTM116 plasmid vector, and used it as bait. We isolated 27 clones that reacted positively for β-galactosidase with the bait vector, but not by themselves. Among them, 24 clones encoded proteins that have previously been shown to bind to the cytoplasmic region of APP (22 clones of FE65, a clone of FE65-L2, and a clone of X11). Besides them, three clones, which encoded human JIP-1b, were isolated. Although JIP-1b has recently been shown to bind to APP (20Taru H. Iijima K. Hase M. Kirino Y. Yagi Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20070-20078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Matsuda S. Yasukawa T. Homma Y. Ito Y. Niikura T. Hiraki T. Hirai S. Ohno S. Kita Y. Kawasumi M. Kouyama K. Yamamoto T. Kyriakis J.M. Nishimoto I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6597-6607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the significance of the binding has not been characterized. Because the 5′-portion of cDNA was missing, this portion was obtained by PCR amplification of human genomic DNA (Clontech) and then connected to the cDNA clone. The full-length human JIP-1b that we obtained consisted of 711 amino acid residues, and contained a JBD in the NH2-terminal region, a Src homology (SH) 3 domain in the middle region, and a phosphotyrosine interacting domain (PID) and kinesin binding (KB) domain in the COOH-terminal region. Binding sites between APP and JIP-1b were first determined by the yeast two-hybrid system. A series of deletion mutants of JIP-1b were inserted into a pACT2 vector, and assayed for their binding to the cytoplasmic region of APP. The NH2-terminal truncated mutant including the PID (Del 4) bound to the cytoplasmic region of APP, whereas the mutant with a further 47-amino acid deletion (Del 6) did not (Fig. 1A). The PID deletion mutant lacking the COOH-terminal 25 amino acids (Del 8) did not bind to the cytoplasmic region of APP. These results suggest that the PID of JIP-1b is the domain that binds to the cytoplasmic region of APP, but did not exclude the possibility that the KB domain is also required for the binding. It is known that the PID of FE65 and X11 recognizes the NPTY motif within the cytoplasmic region of APP and binds to it (24Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). To examine whether this motif is also required for JIP-1b to bind to the cytoplasmic region of APP, the cytoplasmic region of APP and its deletion mutant lacking the NPTY motif were inserted into a pBTM116 vector, and assayed for their binding to JIP-1b. The mutant did not bind to JIP-1b (Fig. 1B), indicating that JIP-1b recognizes the NPTY motif within the cytoplasmic region of APP. Next, the binding of APP to JIP-1b was examined by the GST pull-down method. Recently, it was shown that the COOH-terminal tail region (11 amino acids) of JIP-1b interacts with the TPR domain of kinesin light chain (17Verhey K.J. Meyer D. Deehan R. Blenis J. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Thus, we also examined whether this KB domain affects the binding of APP to JIP-1b. The cytoplasmic region of APP (APPC) and its mutant lacking the NPTY motif (ΔNPTY) were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli. The FLAG-tagged full-length JIP-1b and its truncated mutants lacking the KB domain (ΔKB) or lacking the PID and KB domain (ΔPID) (Fig. 1C) were expressed in HEK293 cells, and assayed for binding to the GST-fused cytoplasmic region of APP (GST-APPC) and its deletion mutant (GST-ΔNPTY). The full-length JIP-1b bound to the GST-APPC, but not to the GST-ΔNPTY (Fig. 1D). ΔKB that retained the PID was still able to bind to the GST-APPC, suggesting that the KB domain is not required for the binding of APP to JIP-1b. The truncated mutant lacking the whole PID (ΔPID) did not bind to the GST-APPC. These results confirmed that the NPTY motif of APP and the PID of JIP-1b are responsible for the binding between APP and JIP-1b. The binding of APP and JIP-1b in mammalian cells was examined by coimmunoprecipitation. The FLAG-tagged JIP-1b with or without APP was expressed in HEK293 cells. Lysates of the cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG or anti-APP (6E10) antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with an anti-APP (UT18) or anti-FLAG antibody. APP was detected in the immunoprecipitates with the anti-FLAG antibody from cells expressing JIP-1b and APP (Fig. 1E). The coimmunoprecipitated APP corresponded to the immature form of APP. Thus, the immature form appeared to be more efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with JIP-1b than the mature forms, although a long exposure of the immunoblot showed that the mature forms of APP were also coimmunoprecipitated with JIP-1b (data not shown). Although a small amount of JIP-1b was immunoprecipitated by the anti-APP antibody (6E10), the increased amount of JIP-1b was detected in the immunoprecipitates with the anti-APP antibody from cells expressing JIP-1b and APP. Because JIP-1b was shown to selectively bind JNK, it is possible that JNK may affect the binding of APP to JIP-1b. To examine the effect of JNK on the binding, the FLAG-tagged JIP-1b was expressed together with APP and the HA-tagged JNK in HEK293 cells, and a similar coimmunoprecipitation experiment was performed. The coimmunoprecipitation of APP and JIP-1b was not affected by the presence of JNK. These results suggest that APP associates with JIP-1b in mammalian cells, and that the binding of JIP-1b to JNK does not affect the association. APP Associates with JNK and Is Phosphorylated on the JIP-1b Scaffold—It was shown that JNK is able to phosphorylate APP on Thr668 (13Standen C.L. Brownlees J. Grierson A.J. Kesavapany S. Lau K-F. McLoughlin D.M. Miller C.C.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that JIP-1b functions as a scaffold protein linking JNK to APP. To examine this possibility, we first tested whether APP associates with JNK through JIP-1b. The FLAG-tagged JIP-1b and/or HA-tagged JNK were expressed in HEK293 cells, and assayed for binding to the GST-APPC. JNK alone did not bind to the GST-APPC. Coexpression of JIP-1b led to the binding of JNK to the GST-APPC, whereas coexpression of JIP-1b lacking the JNK binding domain (ΔJBD) did not although the ΔJBD did bind to the GST-APPC (Fig. 2). These results suggest that APP associates with JNK on the JIP-1b scaffold. Next we examined the effect of the presence of JIP-1b on the in vitro phosphorylation of APP by JNK. It was shown that overexpression of JIP-1b inhibits the JNK activity (14Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Thus, to examine APP phosphorylation quantitatively, JNK and JIP-1b were separately expressed and purified, before being used for the in vitro kinase assay with GST-APPC and its mutants as substrates. The HA-tagged JNK was expressed in HEK293 cells, and the cells were treated with anisomycin to activate the JNK. The activated JNK was purified by immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody, and an equal amount of the activated JNK was used in each reaction of the in vitro kinase assay. The FLAG-tagged JIP-1b and its mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells, and purified with an anti-FLAG antibody bound to agarose gel. The purified JIP-1b and its mutants were detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A), and their amounts were measured by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. In addition the vector (pcDNA3) used for the expression of JIP-1b was also transfected into HEK293 cells, and the cell lysate was treated as was done for the purification of the FLAG-tagged JIP-1b, for use as the control (pcDNA3). The presence of the purified JIP-1b (1.25 μg) enhanced the phosphorylation of APPC by the activated JNK, whereas the level of phosphorylation detected was much less in the presence of the control (pcDNA3) (Fig. 3B). JIP-1b was also phosphorylated by JNK. When the phosphorylation site (Thr668) of APPC was mutated to an alanine (T668A), no phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 3C), confirming that the site phosphorylated by JNK is Thr668. The deletion mutant of APP (ΔNPTY) was phosphorylated to a lower extent. The presence of more JIP-1b (3.75 μg) further enhanced the phosphorylation of APPC by JNK. A mutant JIP-1b with a ΔJBD did not enhance the phosphorylation of either APPC or JIP-1b, whereas a deletion of the kinesin-binding domain (ΔKB) did not affect the enhancement of phosphorylation (Fig. 3D). In addition mutant JIP-1b with a deletion in a part of the PID (Δdel) or a deletion of the PID and KB domain (ΔPID) did not enhance APPC phosphorylation, although their own phosphorylation was not affected (Fig. 3D). Note that APPC phosphorylation by JNK occurred in the absence of JIP-1b (compare lanes a and d in Fig. 3D). Thus, these results suggest that JIP-1b linking APP to JNK enhances the in vitro phosphorylation of APP by JNK. The phosphorylation of APP in mammalian cells was examined in HEK293 cells exogenously expressing APP, JNK, and JIP-1b. The cells were treated with anisomycin to activate JNK, and the JNK activity was measured by in vitro kinase assay using GST-c-Jun as a substrate. The phosphorylation of APP was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-phospho-APP antibody. JNK activation induced the phosphorylation of APP (Fig. 4A). As previously reported (14Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), overexpression of JIP-1b suppressed the activity of JNK. In proportion to the suppression, APP phosphorylation was decreased, suggesting that APP phosphorylation depends on the JNK activity. Over-expression of the ΔPID mutant of JIP-1b, which lacked the APP binding site, further decreased APP phosphorylation, although the level of JNK activity was similar to that in the cells over-expressing the wild-type JIP-1b. These results suggest that JIP-1b functions as a scaffold protein linking JNK to APP in mammalian cells. Overexpression of the ΔJBD mutant of JIP-1b that lacked the JNK binding domain did not affect the activity of JNK, but reduced APP phosphorylation, suggesting that association of ΔJBD with APP inhibited the phosphorylation of APP by JNK. When the Thr668 phosphorylation site of APP was mutated to an alanine, no phosphorylation by activated JNK was observed, indicating that the site phosphorylated by JNK in mammalian cells is Thr668. JIP-1b was shown to be a scaffold protein that interacts with specific multiple components of the JNK pathway namely JNK, MKK7, and MLK3. It was shown that overexpression of JIP-1b enhances the activity of JNK induced by MKK7 or MLK3 (15Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Thus, the upstream components of JNK may affect the APP phosphorylation by JNK through JIP-1b. To examine the effect of upstream components, MKK7 or MLK3 were expressed together with APP, JNK, and JIP-1b in HEK293 cells, and the JNK activity as well as APP phosphorylation were evaluated. Expression of MKK7 alone slightly enhanced the JNK activity, but did not enhance APP phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Coexpression of MKK7 with JIP-1b enhanced the JNK activity and APP phosphorylation. Coexpression of MKK7 with the ΔPID of JIP-1b, which can interact with MKK7 (15Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) but not with APP, enhanced the JNK activity, but not the APP phosphorylation. Expression of MLK3 alone enhanced the JNK activity and APP phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). Coexpre"
https://openalex.org/W1992480202,"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is the central element of a signaling pathway involved in the control of mRNA translation and cell growth. The actions of mTOR are mediated in part through the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein, PHAS-I. In vitro mTOR phosphorylates PHAS-I in sites that control PHAS-I binding to eukaryotic initiation factor 4E; however, whether mTOR directly phosphorylates PHAS-I in cells has been a point of debate. The Arg-Ala-Ile-Pro (RAIP motif) and Phe-Glu-Met-Asp-Ile (tor signaling motif) sequences found in the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of PHAS-I, respectively, are required for the efficient phosphorylation of PHAS-I in cells. Here we show that mutations in either motif markedly decreased the phosphorylation of recombinant PHAS-I by mTOR in vitro. Wild-type PHAS-I, but none of the mutant proteins, was coimmunoprecipitated with hemagglutinin-tagged raptor, an mTOR-associated protein, after extracts of cells overexpressing raptor had been supplemented with recombinant PHAS-I proteins. Moreover, raptor overexpression enhanced the phosphorylation of wild-type PHAS-I by mTOR but not the phosphorylation of the mutant proteins. The results not only provide direct evidence that both the RAIP and tor signaling motifs are important for the phosphorylation by mTOR, possibly by allowing PHAS-I binding to raptor, but also support the view that mTOR phosphorylates PHAS-I in cells.

In reactions conducted in vitro, mTOR phosphorylated purified PHAS-I in Thr36, Thr45, Ser64, and Thr69, suggesting that (Ser/Thr)-Pro was a recognition motif for phosphorylation by mTOR (7Mothe-Satney I.

Uncertainty as to the role of mTOR as a PHAS-I kinase arose from the demonstration that mTOR phosphorylates S6K-1 in Thr389, which is flanked by nonprolyl hydrophobic residues (16Burnett P.E.

This finding clearly eliminates (Ser/Thr)-Pro as the sole determinant for phosphorylation and indicates that the features of the substrate that allow recognition by mTOR are more complicated than the primary sequence of amino acids surrounding the phosphorylation sites. mTOR was shown recently (18Hara K.

Raptor has been shown to bind directly to both PHAS-I and S6K-1, and it has been suggested that raptor presents these proteins to mTOR for phosphorylation (18Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K.

Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar).Although the structural motifs in the substrate that allow direct phosphorylation by mTOR have not been fully defined, two sequences in PHAS-I that are required for the efficient phosphorylation of the protein in cells have been described. The first, referred to as the RAIP motif because of the sequence of amino acids involved, is found in the NH2-terminal region of PHAS-I (21Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The second, referred to as the TOS motif, is formed by the last five amino acids (Phe-Glu-Met-Asp-Ile) in the protein (22Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Disrupting the TOS motif by a Phe to Ala point mutation, or removing the RAIP motif either by Δ16 NH2-terminal truncation or by mutating Ile-Pro to Ala-Ala, markedly decreased phosphorylation of overexpressed PHAS-I in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (21Tee A.R.

Because the sequences of amino acids immediately surrounding Thr36 and Thr45 are identical, the P-Thr36/45 antibodies bind to PHAS-I phosphorylated in either Thr36 or Thr45 (7Mothe-Satney I.

Sarbasso D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2312) Google Scholar), and the peptide-hemocyanin conjugate was used to immunize rabbits as described previously (24Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10305-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Antibodies were purified using columns containing affinity resins prepared by coupling the peptide to Sulfolink beads (Pierce).Monoclonal antibody 9E10, which recognizes the Myc epitope tag, and 12CA5, which recognizes the HA epitope tag, were purified from hybridoma culture medium. Monoclonal antibody to the AU1 epitope tag was from Berkeley Antibody Company.Mutations and Generation of PHAS-I Expression Vectors—Rat PHAS-I cDNA in pBluescript (SK–) was used as template for generating mutations (23Hu C. Pang S. Kong X. Velleca M. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding PHAS-I with a Phe113 to Ala point mutation (F113A PHAS-I) was generated by using the PCR and primers to introduce BamHI sites at the ends. The reverse primer encoded the point mutation. cDNA encoding PHAS-I lacking the NH2-terminal sixteen amino acids (Δ16 PHAS-I) was generated by PCR, again introducing BamHI sites at both ends. To introduce mutations changing coding of Ile15-Pro16 into Ala15-Ala16 (RAAA PHAS-I), site-directed mutagenesis was conducted using a Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) with a mutagenic oligonucleotide. BamHI sites were then added to the ends of the mutant cDNA by PCR. The PCR products encoding the mutant PHAS-I proteins were digested with BamHI and inserted into the BamHI site of pBluescript. Nucleotide sequencing of the coding regions of each construct confirmed that the desired mutations were present and that no secondary mutations were introduced by the mutagenic procedures.Fragments encoding PHAS-I proteins were excised from pBluescript with BamHI and inserted into the BamHI site of either pET14b (Novagen) for bacterial expression or pCMV-Tag 3a (Stratagene) for expression in mammalian cells. Proper orientation of the inserts was determined by restriction mapping and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing.Bacterial Expression and Purification of Recombinant PHAS-I Proteins—The pET14b constructs encode NH2-terminal His-tagged proteins, which were expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (25Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content was determined using the method of Smith et al. (26Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18445) Google Scholar). To assess purity and to confirm concentration, samples (2 μg) of the recombinant proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). The proteins were found as single bands of equal Coomassie Blue staining intensity. 2K. M. Choi, L. P. McMahon, and J. C. Lawrence, Jr., unpublished observations.Raptor Expression Construct—cDNA (4008 bp) encoding HA-tagged human raptor was assembled from three fragments, which were generated by PCR using primers based on the published raptor sequence (18Hara K.

Fragment 1 (bp 1–1043) was amplified from I.M.A.G.E. clone 3635589, fragment 2 (bp 952–1968) was amplified from reverse-transcribed human skeletal muscle cDNA (7175–1; Clontech), and fragment 3 (bp 1963–4008) was generated from I.M.A.G.E. clone 6057826. BamHI sites at bp 1963–1968 were introduced into both fragment 2 and fragment 3. Creating these sites did not change amino acid coding, and it allowed joining of the pieces. All three fragments were inserted into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Next, cDNA encoding the triple HA tag from pKH3 (28Mattingly R.R. Sorisky A. Brann M.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7943-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR and ligated into the SalI and EcoRI sites of pBluescript. Fragment 1 was excised and inserted into the EcoRI and XmaI sites of this construct. Separately, fragment 3 was excised with BamHI and NotI and inserted between these sites in pBluescript (SK–). Fragment 2 was then removed with XmaI and BamHI and inserted between these sites in the fragment 3/pBluescript construct. The resulting construct was digested with KpnI and XmaI, which cut pBluescript and the 5′ end of fragment 2, respectively. Between these sites was inserted the HA-fragment 1 cDNA that had been excised from pBluescript with KpnI and XmaI, thus generating full-length HA-tagged raptor. The raptor cDNA was excised from pBluescript with KpnI and NotI and inserted between these sites in pcDNA3. The coding region was sequenced and found to be free of errors.Overexpression of mTOR, Raptor, and PHAS-I Proteins—293T cells were seeded into plastic tissue culture dishes (2 × 104 cells/cm2; Falcon) and cultured in humidified 5.0% CO2 in air for 24 h in growth medium composed of 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For expression of AU1-mTOR, 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3 alone or pcDNA3 containing an AU1-mTOR insert by using TransIT-LT2 (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI) and 5 μg of DNA/100-mm-diameter dish as described previously (15Brunn G.J.

Transfections for expressing PHAS-I proteins and HA-raptor were performed in exactly the same manner, except using the expression vectors described in the preceding paragraphs. Cells were used in experiments 18–20 h after transfection.Immunoprecipitations—For AU1-mTOR and HA-raptor, cells were homogenized in buffer (750 μl/100-mm-diameter dish) containing 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm microcystin LR, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. AU1-mTOR and HA-raptor were immunoprecipitated by using anti-AU1 antibody or 12CA5, respectively, bound to protein G-agarose beads as described previously (29McMahon L.P. Choi K.M. Lin T.A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7428-7438Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Wash buffers contained 0.1% Tween 20.For Myc-tagged PHAS-I, 293T cells were rinsed with 5 ml of 140 mm NaCl and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and then lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 500 μm microcystin LR, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples (750 μl) of the supernatants were incubated for 3 h with 9E10 antibody (5 μg) immobilized on goat anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads (20 μl packed; ICN Biomedicals). The beads were washed (1 ml buffer/wash) twice with lysis buffer and twice with buffer minus Nonidet P-40.Immune Complex Assay of mTOR Activity—Prior to the kinase assay, washed AU1-mTOR complexes were incubated at 21 °C for 90 min without additions or with 5 μg of mTAb1 in 20 μl of Buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm microcystin LR, 10 mm Na-HEPES, and 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4). The beads were rinsed twice and suspended in 20 μl of Buffer A. The kinase reactions were initiated by adding 20 μl of Buffer A supplemented with 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (2000 mCi/mmol), 20 mm MnCl2, and 40 μg/ml of wild-type or mutant PHAS-I. Reactions were terminated after 30 min by adding SDS sample buffer. Measurements under these conditions reflect the initial rate of phosphorylation, as less than 5% of the available substrates were phosphorylated, and the reactions have been shown to proceed linearly for 60 min (29McMahon L.P. Choi K.M. Lin T.A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7428-7438Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Electrophoretic Analyses—Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE before proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon (Millipore) membranes and immunoblotted as described previously (7Mothe-Satney I.

The amounts of 32P incorporated into PHAS-I proteins were determined by scintillation counting of gel slices. Relative levels of 32P incorporation were determined by phosphorimaging. Signal intensities of bands in immunoblots were determined by scanning laser densitometry.Other Materials—Rapamycin and LY294002 were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem International. Purified activated Erk2 isoform was prepared as described by Khokhlatchev et al. (30Khokhlatchev A. Xu S.C. English J. Wu P.Q. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-FKBP12 was expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (14Sabers C.J. Martin M.M. Brunn G.J. Williams J.M. Dumont F.J. Wiederrecht G. Abraham R.T. J.

[γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.RESULTSInhibitory Effects of Mutations of the TOS and RAIP Motifs on Phosphorylation of PHAS-I by mTOR—The effects of disrupting the TOS and RAIP motifs on phosphorylation of PHAS-I by mTOR were investigated by performing immune complex kinase assays. mTOR was expressed as an AU1 epitope-tagged protein in 293T cells and immunoprecipitated prior to the assay. After incubating the immunopurified mTOR with the antibody, mTAb1, mTOR activity was assessed using purified recombinant PHAS-I proteins as substrates. mTAb1 activates mTOR by binding to an inhibitory regulatory domain located in the COOH-terminal region of mTOR (17Brunn G.J.

As the three Thr-Pro sites are the preferred sites in PHAS-I for phosphorylation by mTOR, phosphorylation was also assessed by immunoblotting with P-Thr36/45 and P-Thr69 antibodies.The TOS motif, which is formed by the last five COOH-terminal amino acids in PHAS-I (Fig. 1), was disrupted by mutating Phe113 to Ala (22Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The mutant protein, designated F113A PHAS-I, was phosphorylated by mTOR at only 25% of the rate at which mTOR phosphorylated wild-type PHAS-I (Fig. 2). Disrupting the TOS motif decreased the phosphorylation of Thr36/Thr45 and Thr69 by 72 and 86%, respectively. In contrast, the Phe113 to Ala mutation attenuated the phosphorylation of neither Thr36/Thr45 nor Thr69 by mitogen-activated protein kinase (Fig. 3), indicating that phosphorylation sites were not compromised in the recombinant protein.Fig. 2Phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant PHAS-I proteins by mTOR. 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3 vector alone or with vector containing an AU1-mTOR insert. After 18 h mTOR immunoprecipitations were conducted with anti-AU1 antibody bound to protein G-agarose. After washing immune complexes, samples were incubated for 90 min at 22 °C with 0.25 mg/ml mTAb1. The beads were then rinsed and suspended in 20 μl of Buffer A before kinase reactions were initiated by adding 20 μl of Buffer A supplemented with 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 20 mm MnCl2, and 40 μg/ml of wild-type PHAS-I, F113A PHAS-I, RAAA PHAS-I, or Δ16 PHAS-I. After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were prepared with P-Thr36/45 and P-Thr69 antibodies. Phosphorylation by samples from cells transfected with vector alone was negligible (Fig. 4). 32P contents of the proteins were determined by scintillation counting of gel slices. 32P incorporated (mol 32P/mol PHAS-I protein ± S.E., n = 5) by mTOR were as follows: wild-type (0.024 ± 0.005), F113A (0.006 ± 0.001), RAAA (0.012 ± 0.002), and Δ16 (0.007 ± 0.002). In addition to total phosphorylation, the intensities of the bands in immunoblots prepared with P-Thr36/45 and P-Thr69 were determined by optical density scanning. The results presented are expressed relative to the 32P content or the immunoblot signals from wild-type PHAS-I and are means ± S.E. from five experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant PHAS-I proteins by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase.

SOCS-1-/- mice die before weaning with a complex disease characterized by fatty degeneration and necrosis of the liver. This disease is mediated by interferon (IFN) γ as neonatal mortality fails to occur in SOCS-1-/-IFNγ-/- mice. However, the immune system of healthy SOCS-1-/-IFNγ-/- mice is dysregulated with a reduced ratio of CD4:CD8 T cells and increases in some aspects of T cell activation. SOCS-1-/-IFNγ-/- mice also die before their wild type and IFNγ-/- counterparts with a range of inflammatory conditions including pneumonia, gut infiltration, and skin ulceration, suggesting that SOCS-1 controls not only IFNγ signaling, but also other immunoregulatory factors. This study shows that T cells from SOCS-1-deficient mice display hypersensitivity to cytokines that act through the γc receptor. SOCS-1 expression is induced by interleukin (IL) 2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15, and SOCS-1-deficient T cells show increased proliferation and prolonged survival in response to IL-2 and IL-4. Furthermore, IL-2 induced increased STAT5 phosphorylation and CD44 expression in SOCS-1-deficient T cells compared with controls.

SOCS-1-deficient mice die before weaning with a complex neonatal disease characterized by fatty degeneration of the liver, lymphocyte activation, and hematopoietic infiltration in several tissues (2Starr R. Metcalf D. Elefanty A.G. Brysha M. Willson T.A. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14395-14399Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 3Naka T.

This disease is dependent on IFNγ as mice lacking both SOCS-1 and IFNγ do not develop liver disease and survive in apparent health into adult life (4Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L. Handman E. Sprigg N.S. Corbin J.E. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Owczarek C.M. Kay T.W. Nicola N.A. Hertzog P.J. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J.

Disease in SOCS-1–/– mice is characterized by increased production of IFNγ resulting in higher levels of IFNγ in the serum, and hypersensitivity to IFNγ (5Marine J.C. Topham D.J. McKay C. Wang D.

Although IFNγ plays a key role in neonatal disease in SOCS-1–/– mice, mice lacking both SOCS-1 and IFNγ die prematurely with a variety of inflammatory conditions including skin ulceration, pneumonia, and hematopoietic infiltration of the gut (7Metcalf D.

This suggests that in vivo SOCS-1 not only controls IFNγ signaling, but also regulates other aspects of immune cell function. Recently, we have shown that SOCS-1 influences T cell homeostasis (8Cornish A.L. Davey G.M. Metcalf D. Purton J.F. Corbin J.E. Greenhalgh C.J. Darwiche R. Wu L. Nicola N.A. Godfrey D.I. Heath W.R.

Mice lacking SOCS-1 have a decreased ratio of CD4:CD8 T cells, and expression of the activation marker CD44 is increased on T cells (5Marine J.C. Topham D.J. McKay C. Wang D. Parganas E.

Immunology. 2001; 104: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, proliferation in vivo of both CD4+ and CD8+ cells is increased in peripheral lymphoid organs of SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– mice. These defects occur not only in sick SOCS-1–/– mice but are evident also in healthy SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– mice (8Cornish A.L. Davey G.M. Metcalf D. Purton J.F. Corbin J.E. Greenhalgh C.J. Darwiche R. Wu L. Nicola N.A. Godfrey D.I. Heath W.R. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Starr R. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 878-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The apparent activation state of T cells in SOCS-1-deficient mice is antigen-independent. T cell receptor (TCR)-transgenic OT-I SOCS-1–/– mice, in which T cells respond specifically to an exogenous antigen, ovalbumin, still appear activated despite the absence of ovalbumin stimulation (8Cornish A.L. Davey G.M. Metcalf D. Purton J.F. Corbin J.E. Greenhalgh C.J. Darwiche R. Wu L. Nicola N.A. Godfrey D.I. Heath W.R. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Starr R. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 878-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cytokines have been shown previously to be important regulators of T cell homeostasis (reviewed in Ref. 11Jameson S.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Altered ratios of CD4:CD8 T cells can occur in instances where cytokine signaling is dysregulated. For example, IL-12 can increase the numbers of CD8+ cells in the thymus (12Godfrey D.I. Kennedy J. Gately M.K. Hakimi J. Hubbard B.R. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2729-2735PubMed Google Scholar), and IFNα/β can promote the survival of CD8+ T cells over that of CD4+ T cells (13Marrack P. Kappler J. Mitchell T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the absence of SOCS-1, IL-12 responses are dysregulated, with IL-12 inducing increased T cell proliferation and natural killer cell activity (14Eyles J.L. Metcalf D. Grusby M.J. Hilton D.J. Starr R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43735-43740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, even in the absence of IL-12 signaling in SOCS-1–/–STAT4–/– mice, T cell function is still perturbed with a decreased CD4:CD8 ratio and increases in apparent activation (14Eyles J.L. Metcalf D. Grusby M.J. Hilton D.J. Starr R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43735-43740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This suggests that, even though uncontrolled IL-12 signaling may contribute to T cell defects, other immunoregulatory factors are also important. Cytokines that appear to play the most pivotal roles in controlling T cell function are those that signal through the common γ chain receptor subunit (γc), that is IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 (15He Y.W. Malek T.R. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 503-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Habib T. Senadheera S. Weinberg K. Kaushansky K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8725-8731Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Of these IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 show clear roles in T cell proliferation and survival (17Leung D.T. Morefield S. Willerford D.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3527-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Schluns K.S. Kieper W.C. Jameson S.C. Lefrancois L. Nat.

Mathis D. Butz E.A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Moreover, altered γc-dependent cytokine signaling can lead to changes in the ratio of CD4:CD8 T cells within the mouse. Excess IL-7, for example, induces a decreased CD4:CD8 ratio (22Mertsching E. Burdet C. Ceredig R. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Geiselhart L.A. Humphries C.A. Gregorio T.A. Mou S. Subleski J. Komschlies K.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3019-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas the converse is evident in IL-15R-deficient mice (24Lodolce J.P. Boone D.L. Chai S. Swain R.E. Dassopoulos T. Trettin S. Ma A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 669-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanism underlying the decreased ratio of CD4:CD8 T cells and the increased proliferation and CD44 expression by T cells in mice lacking SOCS-1, responses to the γc-dependent cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 were investigated in T cells from healthy SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– mice. Relative to control cells, T cells from mice lacking SOCS-1 displayed increased sensitivity to γc-dependent cytokines, particularly IL-2. Thus, SOCS-1 appears not only to regulate IFNγ signaling in vivo, but may also control responses to γc-dependent cytokines in peripheral T cells. SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– mice were generated as described previously on a mixed 129/Sv and C57BL/6 genetic background (2Starr R. Metcalf D. Elefanty A.G. Brysha M. Willson T.A. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J.

IFNγ–/– mice on an inbred C57BL/6 background (C57BL/6-IFNγtm1Ts) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories via Monash University (25Dalton D.K. Pitts-Meek S. Keshav S. Figari I.S. Bradley A. Stewart T.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1739-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). For studies on a syngeneic genetic background, SOCS-1–/– mice were backcrossed at least 10 generations to C57BL/6 mice and then mated with IFNγ–/– mice to produce mice deficient for both SOCS-1 and IFNγ. These mice had an identical phenotype to SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– mice generated on a mixed 129/Sv and C57BL/6 genetic background, as described previously (4Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L. Handman E. Sprigg N.S. Corbin J.E. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Owczarek C.M. Kay T.W. Nicola N.A. Hertzog P.J. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J.

Briefly, the SOCS-1 coding region was replaced by a SOCS-1 coding region flanked by LoxP sites. Immediately after the 3′ LoxP site, the human CD4 reporter gene (hCD4) was inserted. These mice were mated with CMV-Cre mice (27Schwenk F. Baron U. Rajewsky K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5080-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), allowing deletion of SOCS-1 in most tissues. CMV-Cre mice were backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 genetic background for at least 10 generations. Mice were genotyped for SOCS-1 and IFNγ alleles by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA obtained from tail tips as described (4Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L. Handman E. Sprigg N.S. Corbin J.E. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Owczarek C.M. Kay T.W. Nicola N.A. Hertzog P.J. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J.

Mice from matings with Cre transgenic mice were genotyped for their SOCS-1 allele as described (26Chong M.M.W. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Stanley E.G. Purton J.F. Godfrey D.I. Hilton D.J. Starr R.

Briefly, mice were genotyped by Southern blot analysis from tail tips to discriminate between the SOCS-1+, SOCS-1–, and SOCS-1lox alleles. Recombination of the SOCS-1lox allele was also confirmed by Southern blotting. Cre transgenic mice were genotyped by PCR as described (26Chong M.M.W. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Stanley E.G. Purton J.F.

Lymphoid cells were isolated from pooled inguinal, brachial, axillary, submandibular, and mesenteric lymph nodes from SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– or IFNγ–/– mice. Cells were sorted into CD4+CD44lo, CD4+CD44hi, CD8+CD44lo, or CD8+CD44hi T cell populations by FACS. Cells were stained with mAb for CD44, CD4 and CD8 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), each fraction was gated and live cells sorted by FACS. An aliquot of each population was re-analyzed by FACS to confirm the accuracy of the sort. Isolated cell populations were plated into 96-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well in 100 μl/well of RPMI medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 μg/ml anti-mouse IL-2 (anti-mIL-2; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and various concentrations of recombinant human IL-2, and mouse IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 (rhIL-2, rmIL-7, rmIL-15, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ; rmIL-4, R&D Systems). Proliferation Analysis—After 3 days of culture 1 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) was added to each well for 17 h. After washing, cell associated radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Survival and CD44 Up-regulation—After 3.5 days of culture (i.e. at the same time as the proliferation assays were harvested), cells were stained with propidium iodide and mAb to CD44, and analyzed by FACS. Live cells were identified by the exclusion of propidium iodide. As part of the SOCS-1lox targeting strategy, SOCS-1 was replaced by the hCD4 reporter gene that is only expressed from the SOCS-1 promoter upon Cre recombination of the flanked LoxP sites. Cells from pooled lymph nodes and spleen were incubated with 10 μg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 (clone 145–2C11), 5 units/ml rhIL-2 (rhIL-2; McKesson HBOC, Rockville, MD), 5 μg/ml rmIL-4, 2.5 ng/ml rmIL-7, and 10 ng/ml rhIL-15 for either 4 or 20 h. For some of the samples, 0.5 μg/ml neutralizing antibodies specific for IL-2 and/or IFNγ (clone HB170) were added. Cells were stained with antibodies to CD4, CD8, and hCD4 and analyzed by FACS. Expression of hCD4 was used as a surrogate marker of SOCS-1 transcriptional activity. Lymph node suspensions from either SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– or IFNγ–/– mice were analyzed by FACS for expression of cytokine receptors using the following antibodies: biotinylated anti-IL-4R (R&D Systems), biotinylated anti-IL-7Rα and anti-γc chain receptor, and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-IL-2Rα and -Rβ (BD Pharmingen). T cells were isolated from pooled lymph nodes and spleen of SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– or control IFNγ–/– mice by nylon wool purification and incubated with various concentrations of rhIL-2, mIL-7, or rhIL-15 for 30 min. Western analysis was performed as previously described (28Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Farley A. Starr R. Zhang J.G. Baca M. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed using KALB buffer containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mm NaF, and 2 mm Na3VO4. Protein extracts were resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. STAT5 activation was detected using a mouse mAb specific for phosphorylated STAT5A/B (clone ST5P-4A9; Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Membranes were stripped with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1.5 m glycine, and 200 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and reprobed with mouse mAb to STAT5A and STAT5B (clones ST5a-2H2 and ST5b-10G1 respectively; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) as loading controls. Intracellular calcium flux was monitored as previously described (29Newton K. Kurts C. Harris A.W. Strasser A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 273-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, indo-1/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR)-loaded lymph node cells were stained with mAb for CD4, CD8, and CD44 as described above and then stained with hamster anti-mouse CD3 (clone 145–2C11) at 50 μg/ml. Samples were run on the FACS machine for ∼30 s to obtain a baseline reading, followed by TCR stimulation and calcium flux induction after cross-linking the anti-CD3 Ab with 25 μg/ml anti-hamster IgG (BD Pharmingen). Changes in intracellular calcium concentrations were monitored for 4 – 6 min by calculating the ratio of the fluorescence emissions of T cells at 425 nm and 530 nm by FACS. Data from in vitro assays were analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t test for independent events. Bonferroni adjustments for multiple testing were included. SOCS-1 Expression Is Up-regulated by γc-dependent Cytokines—SOCS-1 expression has been shown to be induced by a number of cytokines (reviewed in Ref. 1Alexander W.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), including members of the γc-dependent cytokine family IL-2 and IL-4 (30Sporri B. Kovanen P.E. Sasaki A. Yoshimura A. Leonard W.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 31Naka T. Narazaki M. Hirata M. Matsumoto T. Minamoto S. Aono A. Nishimoto N. Kajita T. Taga T. Yoshizaki K. Akira S.

Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). Recently, conditional SOCS-1-deficient mice were produced using the Cre-Lox system (26Chong M.M.W. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Stanley E.G. Purton J.F. Godfrey D.I. Hilton D.J. Starr R. Alexander W.S. Kay T.W.H. Immunity. 2003; 18: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These mice were crossed to CMV-Cre mice resulting in widespread deletion of SOCS-1. SOCS-1lox/+ CMV-Cre mice were used to assess SOCS-1 expression in response to γc-dependent cytokines. In these mice, the reporter gene hCD4 is under the regulation of the SOCS-1 promoter and thus provides a surrogate measure of SOCS-1 expression. SOCS-1/hCD4 expression was up-regulated in T cells by the γc-dependent cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 (Fig. 1). Induction of SOCS-1 expression in response to IL-4 and IL-7 was seen in both CD4+ and CD8+ cells, whereas expression was restricted to CD8+ cells in response to IL-2 and IL-15 (Fig. 1). SOCS-1 expression was most strongly induced by IL-4. Ligation of the TCR through anti-CD3 binding also strongly induced SOCS-1 expression in both T cell subsets (Fig. 1), consistent with recent data (33Diehn M. Alizadeh A.A. Rando O.J. Liu C.L. Stankunas K. Botstein D. Crabtree G.R. Brown P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11796-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This expression, however, appears to be largely because of autocrine cytokine production by these cells in response to anti-CD3, as cytokine-induced SOCS-1 expression was almost completely abrogated in the presence of neutralizing antibodies to IL-2 and IFNγ (Fig. 1). Increased Proliferation of SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– T Cells in Response to γc-dependent Cytokines—We then examined whether biological responses to γc-dependent cytokines were perturbed in T cells from SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– mice compared with IFNγ–/– mice. SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– mice display immune defects, including a decreased ratio of CD4:CD8 T cells and increased expression of the activation marker CD44, which complicate direct comparisons with control cells. To overcome this difficulty, T cells were sorted into the following subsets, CD4+CD44lo, CD4+CD44hi, CD8+CD44lo, and CD8+CD44hi. T cells were treated with hIL-2, mIL-7, mIL-4, or mIL-15 (with endogenous mIL-2 effects blocked by a neutralizing anti-mIL-2 antibody) and proliferation was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 2). SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– T cells were more sensitive than control cells to IL-2, with robust proliferation evident at 2–20 ng/ml, doses at which little response was observed for control IFNγ–/– T cells (Fig. 2A). The increase in proliferation was greatest in the CD8+CD44hi fraction, although significant increases were also seen in the CD8+CD44lo T cell subset. IL-4 also induced significantly greater proliferation in SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– CD8+ T cells compared with controls (Fig. 2B). Comparatively low levels of proliferation were induced by IL-7 and no difference in proliferation was observed between T cells from SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– and IFNγ–/– mice (Fig. 2C). IL-15 induced proliferation only at the highest concentration used, 200 ng/ml, and proliferation was increased modestly in SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– CD8+CD44lo T cells (Fig. 2D). Increased Survival of SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– T Cells in Response to γc-dependent Cytokines—Survival of T cells was compared by propidium iodide exclusion after treatment with IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 (Fig. 3). In general, cell survival was promoted by all 4 cytokines examined, with IL-4 and IL-7 having the strongest effect. IL-2 mainly induced survival of CD8+ cells, and survival of CD8+CD44hi cells from SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– mice appeared to be modestly enhanced compared with those from control IFNγ–/– mice (Fig. 3A). IL-4-induced survival was increased significantly in SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– T cells, and this difference was most pronounced in CD4+ cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast, there was no difference in IL-7-induced survival (Fig. 3C) and only minor increases in IL-15-induced survival were observed in SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3D). Increased CD44 Expression by SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– T Cells in Response to γc-dependent Cytokines—Mice lacking SOCS-1 express high levels of CD44 on peripheral T cells, which is most pronounced in cells of the CD8+ lineage. This occurs not only in sick SOCS-1–/– mice, but also in healthy SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– mice and in TCR-transgenic OT-I SOCS-1–/– mice not exposed to a specific antigen, suggesting that up-regulation occurs independently of disease, IFNγ, and specific TCR stimulation by antigen (8Cornish A.L. Davey G.M. Metcalf D. Purton J.F. Corbin J.E. Greenhalgh C.J. Darwiche R. Wu L. Nicola N.A. Godfrey D.I. Heath W.R. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Starr R. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 878-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CD44 up-regulation was examined on sorted CD44lo T cells from healthy SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– mice after γc-dependent cytokine stimulation. In control cells, only minor changes in CD44 expression were induced by treatment with these cytokines. In SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– T cells, however, CD44 expression was strongly induced by IL-2 and to a lesser extent IL-15, but not by IL-4 or IL-7 (Fig. 4). This was only evident in CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4, A, D, and E). Elevated Responses to γc-dependent Cytokines Are Not because of Increased Receptor Expression—To assess whether the changes in sensitivity to γc-dependent cytokines were due merely to changes in receptor expression, the expression of receptor subunits by SOCS-1-deficient T cells was examined (Fig. 5). The receptor subunit γc is shared by the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 cytokine receptor complexes, whereas IL-2Rβ is required for signaling by IL-2 and IL-15, IL-7Rα is specific for IL-7 and IL-2Rα for IL-2 signaling. There appeared to be a higher level of IL-2Rβ expression on SOCS-1-deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5). From previous studies, it is known that IL-2Rβ expression is increased on CD44hi T cells, especially from the CD8+ lineage (20Ku C.C. Murakami M. Sakamoto A. Kappler J. Marrack P. Science. 2000; 288: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 34Zhang X. Sun S. Hwang I. Tough D.F. Sprent J. Immunity. 1998; 8: 591-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). When T cells were separated into CD44lo and CD44hi populations, no difference was observed in IL-2Rβ expression from CD8+ T cell subpopulations from SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– and IFNγ–/– mice. Therefore, the difference observed in the level of expression of IL-2Rβ in the total CD8+ population correlated with increased numbers of CD8+CD44hi T cells in SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– mice. Expression of the receptor subunit γc and the IL-4R differed slightly on CD8+ T cells, however, no difference was observed when CD44lo and CD44hi CD8+ cells were examined separately. No differences in IL-2Rα or IL-7Rα expression levels by T cells were observed between control and SOCS-1-deficient populations. Thus, differences in cytokine sensitivity cannot be attributed to changes in receptor expression levels. Increased STAT5 Phosphorylation in Response to γc-dependent Cytokines—Given the enhanced biological responses of SOCS-1-deficient T cells to γc-dependent cytokines, biochemical studies were performed to determine whether loss of SOCS-1 resulted in increased downstream signaling after γc-dependent cytokine stimulation. As SOCS-1 acts to negatively regulate the JAK-STAT pathway, the activation status of STAT5 in response to γc-dependent cytokines was observed in T cells lacking SOCS-1. STAT5 phosphorylation was enhanced in cells lacking SOCS-1 in response to IL-2 and IL-7. STAT5 phosphorylation in SOCS-1-deficient cells was both more intense and occurred in response to lower concentration of these cytokines (Fig. 6, A and B). Phosphorylation of STAT5 in response to IL-15 was also more intense in SOCS-1– deficient cells, but the increase was less pronounced than for IL-2 and IL-7 (Fig. 6C). These results were also seen in T cells lacking SOCS-1 derived from SOCS-1lox/– lck-Cre mice, compared with SOCS-1-replete T cells from control SOCS-1lox/– mice (data not shown). TCR Signaling Is Not Enhanced in SOCS-1–/–IFNγ–/– T Cells—T cell activation occurs through the specific interaction of the TCR and antigen presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules upon antigen presenting cells. This interaction results in a number of downstream signaling events to induce specific gene activation through the transcription factors NFκB, NFAT, and AP-1. These signaling events include kinase cascades activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and increases in intracellular calcium flux. Interestingly, studies in vitro have identified several components implicated in the TCR signaling pathway, namely Syk, CD3ζ, and Tec, as potential binding partners of SOCS-1 (35Matsuda T.

In addition, reconstitution of the TCR signaling pathway using overexpression of Syk and a chimeric CD8/CD3ζ protein in 293T cells was inhibited by the addition of SOCS-1 (35Matsuda T. Yamamoto T.

https://openalex.org/W2046175921,"Werner syndrome is a hereditary premature aging disorder characterized by genomic instability. Genetic analysis and protein interaction studies indicate that the defective gene product (WRN) may play an important role in DNA replication, recombination, and repair. DNA polymerase β (pol β) is a central participant in both short and long-patch base excision repair (BER) pathways, which function to process most spontaneous, alkylated, and oxidative DNA damage. We report here a physical interaction between WRN and pol β, and using purified proteins reconstitute of a portion of the long-patch BER pathway to examine a potential role for WRN in this repair response. We demonstrate that WRN stimulates pol β strand displacement DNA synthesis and that this stimulation is dependent on the helicase activity of WRN. In addition, a truncated WRN protein, containing primarily the helicase domain, retains helicase activity and is sufficient to mediate the stimulation of pol β. The WRN helicase also unwinds a BER substrate, providing evidence that WRN plays a role in unwinding DNA repair intermediates. Based on these findings, we propose a novel mechanism by which WRN may mediate pol β-directed long-patch BER."

https://openalex.org/W1999225704,"The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D family of proteins also known as AUF1 consists of four isoforms implicated in both nuclear and cytoplasmic functions. The AUF1 proteins are largely nuclear but also are found in the cytoplasm and are thought to undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The nucleocytoplasmic distribution and potential shuttling activity of the individual AUF1 isoforms have not been previously studied in detail. Therefore, we characterized the nucleocytoplasmic transport of each of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D/AUF1 isoforms. All four AUF1 proteins were found to undergo rapid nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in a manner that is transcription-independent, carrier-mediated, and energy-requiring. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the AUF1 proteins is shown to utilize a novel arrangement of nuclear import and export signals. Mutagenesis of the AUF1 proteins and fusion of polypeptides to a green fluorescent protein reporter demonstrated that a nuclear import signal is located in the C-terminal domain of the protein and is found only in the two smaller isoforms. Further mapping demonstrated that nuclear export is facilitated by sequences in AUF1 exon 7 found in the C-terminal domain of the two larger AUF1 isoforms. A subset of AUF1 proteins are shown to directly interact in vitro using purified recombinant proteins and in vivo in the absence of RNA. These results suggest that nuclear import of AUF1 is facilitated by sequences found only in the two smaller isoforms and that nuclear export is facilitated by sequences (exon 7 and the C-terminal domain) found only in the two larger isoforms.

Transport of proteins across the nuclear pore complex involves the recognition of specific signal sequences by transport receptors and adapter proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar).

Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The best characterized nuclear import receptors are members of the importin-β superfamily of RanGTP-binding proteins. Facilitated nuclear import involves nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) within cargo proteins containing any of several canonical basic amino acid motifs (2Izaurralde E. Adam S. RNA. 1998; 4: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar). Some cargo proteins utilize non-canonical NLSs for transport such as the M9 domain, which consists of a glycine-rich amino acid sequence that promotes both protein import and export, and therefore functions as a shuttling sequence (3Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 4Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J.

Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The M9 domain was originally identified in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) A1 and binds to the import receptor, transportin (5Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Apart from hnRNPs C1/C2 and U, all of the other hnRNPs appear to undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (1Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 2Izaurralde E. Adam S. RNA. 1998; 4: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar). hnRNP A1 represents one type of shuttling protein that is a nuclear protein at steady state but shuttles rapidly and accumulates in the cytoplasm with transcription inhibition (3Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 6Vautier D. Chesne P. Cunha C. Calado A. Renard J.P. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1521-1531PubMed Google Scholar), which is associated with the presence of an M9 domain (3Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The requirement for ongoing transcription in the transport of M9 domain-containing proteins is not well understood and is unlikely to simply involve co-transport by binding to mRNAs (7Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). hnRNP K is another type of shuttling RNA-binding protein. It contains a canonical NLS in addition to a unique shuttling domain known as KNS. Unlike hnRNP A1, the nuclear localization of hnRNP K is independent of transcriptional activity unless the NLS motif is deleted (7Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The hnRNP D/AUF1 family, similar to many hnRNPs, is comprised of four related isoforms produced by alternate splicing of a single mRNA (Fig. 1A) (8Dempsey L.A. Li M.J. DePace A. Bray-Ward P. Maizels N. Genomics. 1998; 49: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Wagner B. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). AUF1 consists of a 37-kDa core protein (p37), a 40-kDa protein (p40) with an N-terminal 19 amino acid insertion of exon 2, a 42-kDa protein (p42) with a C-terminal 49 amino acid insertion of exon 7, and a 45-kDa protein (p45) containing both exon 2 and 7 insertions (Fig. 1A) (reviewed in Ref. 10Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The different AUF1 isoforms bind various types of ARE sequences, which are associated with rapid decay of short-lived cytokine and proto-oncogene mRNAs (10Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The different AUF1 isoforms bind to different ARE sequences, which have been attributed to the presence of exon insertions that might alter AUF1 protein conformation (9Wagner B. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 11Laroia G. Schneider R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Different members of the AUF1 family also appear to have multiple functions including transcriptional activation (12Brys A. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4915-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Fuentes-Panana E.M. Peng R. Brewer G. Tan J. Ling P.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8166-8175Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and binding to nucleolin (14Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), telomeric single-stranded DNA (15Eversole A. Maizels N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5425-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and components of the translation initiation apparatus (16Laroia G. Cuesta R. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, all four AUF1 isoforms associate with hnRNP A1 (17Pinol-Roma S. Choi Y.D. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), which is involved in mRNA transport (18Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) and splicing (19Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Although AUF1 proteins are found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, steady state analysis demonstrates a much higher nuclear accumulation of all four proteins (16Laroia G. Cuesta R. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 20Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Heat-shock or down-regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome network mediates even greater nuclear accumulation of AUF1 and the increased abundance of p37 and p40 proteins (16Laroia G. Cuesta R. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 21Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to characterize the mechanisms for AUF1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. We demonstrate that all four AUF1 proteins are capable of undergoing rapid nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and that the shuttling pathway used by the AUF1 proteins is transcription-independent and carrier-mediated. We found that the uninterrupted C-terminal domain (CTD) found in the p37 and p40 AUF1 isoforms possesses a strong nuclear import activity, whereas the CTD interrupted by exon 7 promotes cytoplasmic localization, which is inserted in the CTD of the p42 and p45 isoforms. We show that a subset of AUF1 proteins can directly interact in vitro and in vivo in the absence of RNA, which suggests that nuclear import is probably facilitated by the p37 and p40 isoforms, whereas nuclear export is facilitated by the p42 and p45 isoforms as a part of a larger AUF1 complex of proteins. Cell Culture, Heterokaryon Fusions, Drug Treatments, and Labeling—Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin and subcultured 18 h prior to transfection with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. For immunostaining, cells were first cultured on glass coverslips and heterokaryon fusions using HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells were produced as described previously (3Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) using 50% polyethylene glycol (PEG). Cells were fixed and immunostained 2 h following PEG fusion. Nuclei were stained by the addition of Hoechst 33258 dye (Sigma). Actinomycin D, cycloheximide, adenosine-2′,3′-dialdehyde (AdOX), and 5′-methylthioadenosine were from Sigma. Leptomycin B (LMB) was a generous gift of Dr. Shahana Mahajan (New York University School of Medicine). The in vivo methylation assay was performed by metabolic labeling of cells for 3 h with 10 μCi/ml l-[methyl-3H]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) as a precursor for the methyl donor in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and 40 μg/ml chloramphenicol as described previously (22Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells grown on coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and then blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (23Doria M. Klein N. Lucito R. Schneider R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4747-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cells were fixed-permeabilized with methanol at -20 °C for 5 min. Primary antibodies were diluted in 3% BSA and incubated for either 1 h at 25 °C or 12–16 h at 4 °C. Anti-Myc polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. Polyclonal rabbit anti-AUF1 antibody was produced against recombinant p37 protein (as described below). Monoclonal anti-hnRNP D (5B9) was generously provided by Gideon Dreyfuss (University of Pennsylvania). Following three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine (Jackson Immunoresearch), diluted in 3% BSA for 1 h. Samples were washed again, and Hoechst dye 33258 was included in the final phosphate-buffered saline wash to stain nuclei. After mounting, samples were examined on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Images were captured using Axiovision, version 2 software. Typical images are shown that present roughly equal total fluorescence-staining intensity. Cell Extract—At 36 h post-transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). Cells were disrupted by four passages through a 29-gauge needle followed by incubation on ice for 20 min. This procedure disrupts nuclei and produces whole cell lysates that contain soluble nuclear and cytoplasmic protein. Lysates were cleared by microcentrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Plasmids—FLAG-AUF1 constructs were made by PCR amplification of each AUF1 isoform cDNA to generate a HindIII site upstream of the initiating AUG codon and an EcoRI site downstream of the termination codon. PCR products were purified by gel-electrophoresis (Qiagen), digested with HindIII and EcoRI, and then ligated into pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma) digested with the same enzymes. The resulting construct contains the 9-amino acid FLAG epitope fused in-frame to the N terminus of each AUF1 coding region. The truncation mutants, FLAG-p37ΔCTD and FLAG-p40ΔCTD, were created by digesting FLAG-p37 or FLAG-p40 with HindIII and XbaI and ligating the resulting fragments into pFLAG-CMV-2 digested with the same enzymes. Flag-p37Δ12 was created by standard PCR overlap extension using primers spanning the deleted sequence and primers containing the 5′-HindIII and 3′-EcoRI sites. The resulting fragment was cloned into pFLAG-CMV-2 as noted above. GFP-CTD was constructed by ligating a purified, digested PCR product generated by amplifying either FLAG-p37 or FLAG-p42 plasmids using a 5′-HindIII primer and the 3′-EcoRI primer into pEGFP-C3 (Clontech) digested with the same enzymes. Plasmids encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions of each AUF1 isoform were also constructed by PCR cloning. An EcoRI site upstream of the initiating AUG codon was introduced as well as a XhoI site downstream of the termination codon. PCR products were purified by gel-electrophoresis, digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and then cloned into pGEX-4TI (Amersham Biosciences) digested with the same enzymes. To generate His-tagged AUF1 proteins, cDNAs were PCR cloned into pET-23b (Novagen) using the BamHI and XhoI sites, allowing in-frame fusion with the N-terminal T7 tag and the C-terminal His tag. Specific details of any oligomer are available upon request. Each reading frame was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids encoding Myc-tagged hnRNP A1, Myc-tagged hnRNP C1, GFP fused to the SV40 nuclear localization sequence, GFP-NLS, or GFP fused to the α-subunit of IκB (GFP-IκBα) have all been described elsewhere (24Calado A. Kutay U. Kuhn U. Wahle E. Carmo-Fonseca M. RNA. 2000; 6: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Siomi M.C. Eder P.S. Kataoka N. Wan L. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. J.

The GFP-p37 plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. David Port (University of Colorado Health Science Center). Recombinant Protein Purification—All of the recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells. Bacterial lysate preparation and purification with glutathione-Sepharose 4B was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). His-tagged AUF1 proteins were purified using TALON resin (Clontech). Protein concentrations and purity were determined by Coomassie Blue staining and comparison to a titration of BSA. Antibody Production and Purification—Rabbits were immunized with GST-p37 following a standard protocol (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc.). Thrombin cleavage of the GST moiety produced nearly full-length p37 protein, which was then coupled to Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad). Crude antisera were passed over immobilized GST (Amersham Biosciences) and then affinity-purified using the p37 resin. In Vitro AUF1 Protein Interaction Analysis—Recombinant proteins were incubated in 100 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.5, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) for 1 h at 4 °C. 15 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B slurry was then added followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were washed three times with binding buffer, eluted by boiling in SDS-loading dye, and then resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed using polyclonal anti-GST antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and monoclonal anti-T7 antibody from Novagen. In Vivo AUF1 Protein Interaction Analysis—CHO cells were transfected with vectors expressing GFP-p37 AUF1 and FLAG-tagged p37, p40, p42, or p45 AUF1 proteins as described above. Extracts were prepared using buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor) and precleared using Protein G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). FLAG-AUF1 proteins were immunoprecipitated using EZview anti-FLAG affinity gel (Sigma) for 4 h with or without the addition of 100 μg/ml RNaseA. Reactions were washed, and associated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using antibodies to GFP (Molecular Probes) or FLAG (Sigma). Steady State Distribution of AUF1 Protein Isoforms—Indirect immunofluorescence staining was carried out using affinity-purified antiserum that recognizes all four AUF1 isoforms. Endogenous AUF1 protein produced a strong nuclear signal with nucleolar exclusion and a weak cytoplasmic signal in CHO and COS-1 cells that was evident only when images were overexposed as shown in Fig. 1B, upper panels. This pattern was independent of different fixation and permeabilization techniques and was also found in HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). To determine whether AUF1 isoforms exhibit differential localization, cDNAs were cloned for all four AUF1 proteins linked to an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for each isoform. Indirect immunofluorescence staining of the FLAG epitope revealed that all four AUF1 isoforms (at a similar staining intensity) localized largely in the nucleus (Fig. 1B, lower panels), which was independent of the amount of plasmid transfected and the abundance of protein produced (data not shown). Identical results were obtained in CHO, HeLa, and NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). Therefore, all four AUF1 isoforms localized largely but not exclusively to the nucleus at steady state. Immunoblot analysis of FLAG-AUF1 proteins from equal amounts of whole cell lysates (Fig. 1C) showed that proteins were undegraded and of proper molecular weight. The lower abundance of the p37 and p40 AUF1 isoforms is consistent with their reduced stability (11Laroia G. Schneider R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Laroia G. Cuesta R. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of Myc-hnRNPs A1 and C1 also found them to be undegraded and of proper molecular weight (data not shown) as shown previously (24Calado A. Kutay U. Kuhn U. Wahle E. Carmo-Fonseca M. RNA. 2000; 6: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Siomi M.C. Eder P.S. Kataoka N. Wan L. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Rapid and Facilitated Shuttling of All Four AUF1 Protein Isoforms—The heterokaryon fusion assay was used to determine whether all four AUF1 isoforms possess nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids expressing individual FLAG-AUF1 isoforms fused to non-transfected murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in the presence of cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis, and heterokaryons were fixed and immunostained for transfected FLAG-AUF1 protein. Hoechst DNA staining was used to distinguish murine NIH 3T3 cell nuclei, which produce a distinct punctate staining pattern, from human HeLa nuclei, which stain diffusely (25Siomi M.C. Eder P.S. Kataoka N. Wan L. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). All four AUF1 isoforms displayed rapid shuttling activity, moving from HeLa cell nuclei to murine 3T3 cell nuclei within 2 h following cell fusion (indicated by arrows) (Fig. 2). These results are similar to Myc-tagged hnRNP A1, an established rapid shuttling protein (Fig. 2) (27Moser F.G. Dorman B.P. Ruddle F.H. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Phase-contrast images indicate the position of nuclei in fused cells. Myc-tagged hnRNP C1, which does not shuttle, remained in the original transfected HeLa cell nuclei. Identical results were obtained using COS-1 cells instead of HeLa cells to donate FLAG-AUF1 proteins (data not shown), indicating that AUF1-shuttling activity is a rapid and general phenomenon. FLAG-AUF1 protein, Myc-C1, and Myc-A1 proteins were identified in equal amounts of whole cell lysates and shown to be undegraded and of proper molecular weight. The nucleocytoplasmic movement of AUF1 isoforms could occur by diffusion or by facilitated transport. Because at 4 °C both receptor-mediated nuclear import and export are inhibited whereas diffusion is unaffected (3Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), nuclear localization at 4 °C indicates use of a receptor-binding pathway, whereas cytoplasmic localization implies passive diffusion. As a control for receptor-mediated transport, a plasmid expressing the GFP fused to the SV40 NLS was used (24Calado A. Kutay U. Kuhn U. Wahle E. Carmo-Fonseca M. RNA. 2000; 6: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Nuclear import of a GFP-NLS control was blocked at 4 °C, and diffusion was unopposed, allowing cytoplasmic accumulation beyond nuclear borders (data not shown), whereas endogenous AUF1 protein localization at 4 °C was unchanged from that at 37 °C, indicating that AUF1 export is energy-dependent (data not shown). Transcription and CRM1-independent Transport of AUF1 Protein—Transcriptional inhibition alters the subcellular localization of many but not all RNA-binding proteins. Several hnRNP family members, HuR, and poly(A)-binding protein 1, which contain non-canonical NLSs, are dependent on transcription for nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (1Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Studies also indicate an active role for transcription acting on the M9 domain itself in hnRNP A1 (25Siomi M.C. Eder P.S. Kataoka N. Wan L. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Therefore, cells were treated with actinomycin D or vehicle control for 4 h to inhibit transcription prior to immunostaining to determine whether endogenous AUF1 protein localization is dependent on active transcription. As expected, Myc-tagged hnRNP A1 demonstrated a clearly visible and significant increase in cytoplasmic accumulation with transcriptional inhibition (Fig. 3, compare actinomycin D (Act. D) -/+ panels). There was no such change observed in endogenous AUF1 distribution with transcription inhibition, although nucleolar exclusion was lost. Identical results were obtained for FLAG-AUF1 proteins expressed from transfected plasmids, which was independent of the concentration of actinomycin D or increasing the time of treatment to 6 h (data not shown). Therefore, localization of AUF1 proteins is independent of ongoing transcription. LMB inhibits CRM1-mediated nuclear export (1Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). LMB was used to determine whether AUF1 proteins are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner. Cells were transiently transfected with vectors expressing either FLAG-AUF1 or GFP-IκBα whose localization has been shown to be sensitive to LMB treatment (26Tam W.F. Lee L.H. Davis L. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Cells were then treated with LMB or vehicle control for 1 h prior to immunostaining endogenous or transfected AUF1 proteins as described previously (26Tam W.F. Lee L.H. Davis L. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Images were somewhat overexposed to make cytoplasmic AUF1 protein more readily detectable. Endogenous AUF1 and FLAG-p37 proteins displayed low level cytoplasmic staining, which was unchanged by LMB treatment (Fig. 4, AUF1 panels). GFP-IκB showed a marked increase in nuclear staining and decreased cytoplasmic staining compared with mock-treated cells. Collectively, these results indicate that AUF1 is exported from the nucleus via a CRM1-independent and transcription-independent mechanism. AUF1 Nuclear Uptake Is Mediated by the Uninterrupted C-terminal Domain—The M9 domain of hnRNP A1 is sufficient to mediate transportin binding and nuclear import (28Siomi M.C. Fromont M. Rain J.C. Wan L. Wang F. Legrain P. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4141-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is loosely characterized as a region that is rich in glycine, arginine, and asparagine (25Siomi M.C. Eder P.S. Kataoka N. Wan L. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), although many transportin-binding proteins contain little if any homology to the M9 consensus sequence (1Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 28Siomi M.C. Fromont M. Rain J.C. Wan L. Wang F. Legrain P. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4141-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Transportin reportedly interacts in vitro with the CTD of AUF1 proteins, although only the p42 and p45 isoforms were tested (25Siomi M.C. Eder P.S. Kataoka N. Wan L. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The role of the AUF1 CTD in transport is unknown. All four AUF1 isoforms share a common CTD but it is interrupted in the p42 and p45 isoforms by insertion of exon 7 (see Fig. 1A). Therefore, we created truncation mutants of FLAG-p37 and FLAG-p40 to determine whether the uninterrupted 35-amino acid CTD mediates AUF1 nuclear uptake (Fig. 5A). In vitro binding studies showed that deletion of the CTD does not affect the ARE binding ability of AUF1 proteins (29Demaria C.T. Sun Y. Long L. Wagner B.J. Brewer G. J. Biol.

Human cytomegalovirus encodes a GPCR termed US28 that is homologous to the human chemokine family of GPCRs but differs from the cellular receptors in that it maintains high constitutive activity in the absence of agonist. Although US28 is constitutively active, mechanisms that regulate this activity are unknown. We provide evidence that US28 is constitutively phosphorylated by GRKs in cells and that in consequence, β-arrestin 2 is localized to the plasma membrane. Deletion of the carboxyl terminal 40 amino acids in US28 generates a receptor that is severely impaired in its ability to become phosphorylated and recruit β-arrestin and accordingly demonstrates increased inositol phosphate signaling. This result indicates that the carboxyl terminus of US28 contains an important signaling regulatory region and mutational analysis deleting carboxyl terminal serines identified serine 323 as a critical residue within this region. In addition, overexpression of wild type GRK5 leads to hyperphosphorylation of US28 that results in a decrease of inositol phosphate accumulation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that GRK phosphorylation and recruitment of β-arrestin to the US28 viral GPCR attenuates signaling to the traditional Gαq-stimulated inositol phosphate pathway. Finally, in contrast to the results with inositol phosphate signaling, we provide evidence that the US28 carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites and β-arrestin-interacting domain are required for maximal activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Taken together, these results indicate that US28 interacts with these important regulatory proteins to control multiple aspects of signal transmission. Understanding the regulation of viral GPCRs by GRKs and β-arrestins will provide important new insights into not only aspects of viral pathogenesis but also basic mechanisms of receptor signaling.

Stimulation of GPCRs with agonist leads to increased GTPase activity of heterotrimeric G-proteins that in turn modulate downstream effectors such as the second messenger-generating adenylyl cyclases and phospholipases. Phosphorylation of the receptors by GPCR kinases (GRKs) and recruitment of β-arrestins to the agonist-occupied receptors attenuates signaling by blocking G-proteins from further interaction with the receptors, a process also known as desensitization (4Koenig J.A.

This is a particularly attractive hypothesis, since one of the hallmarks of the herpesviruses is their ability to set up a lifelong latent or persistent infection in the host. The genomes of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human herpesvirus 6, human herpesvirus 7, and human herpesvirus 8 all contain one or more open reading frames with homology to the chemokine receptors. Interestingly, several of these virally encoded GPCRs exhibit high levels of constitutive activity in the absence of agonist (19Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R.

Studies using rodent cytomegaloviruses have indicated that the UL33 counterparts termed M33 and R33 are required for viral dissemination and replication in the salivary gland and are therefore important for virulence in vivo (14Davis-Poynter N.J.

Bruggeman C.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2352-2363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent biochemical studies indicate that the HCMV US28 and mouse cytomegalovirus M33 proteins share many common signaling activities, indicating that US28 may also play an important role in viral replication in vivo (23Waldhoer M. Kledal T.N. Farrell H. Schwartz T.W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8161-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Expression of HCMV US28 on the surface of leukocytes promotes cell rolling and adhesion in in vitro models, whereas US28 expression in smooth muscle cells stimulates cell migration (25Haskell C.A.

These studies suggest that US28 is important in promoting virus trafficking from the circulation to inflammatory sites and may have significant effects on HCMV-induced diseases such as atherosclerosis.US28 is closely related to the receptors for β-chemokines such as CCR1, and accordingly US28 binds to several chemokines including RANTES, MCP-1, and Fractalkine (13Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 24Gao J.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol.

Although US28 binds to these chemokines, the receptor has high constitutive activity even in the absence of chemokine (19Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 23Waldhoer M. Kledal T.N. Farrell H. Schwartz T.W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8161-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Some reports indicate that binding of RANTES or MCP-1 can increase US28 activity; however, this activity seems to vary with the cell type as well as the specific signaling pathway being activated (24Gao J.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28539-28542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Billstrom M.A. Johnson G.L. Avdi N.J. Worthen G.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5535-5544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to other viral encoded GPCRs, US28 constitutively activates Gαq-dependent signaling pathways that stimulate phospholipases, leading to elevation of inositol phosphate levels. US28 signaling also activates mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways as well as the cAMP-response element-binding protein and NF-κB transcription factors, although the mechanisms by which these pathways are regulated by US28 is less clear (19Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 23Waldhoer M. Kledal T.N.

Virol. 1998; 72: 5535-5544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). US28 appears to be functionally similar to its cellular counterparts in that the receptor undergoes internalization via the cellular endocytic machinery; however, unlike the cellular GPCRs that are internalized in response to agonist stimulation, US28 appears to undergo constitutive internalization (30Fraile-Ramos A. Kledal T.N. Pelchen-Matthews A. Bowers K. Schwartz T.W. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1737-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Mokros T. Rehm A. Droese J. Oppermann M. Lipp M. Hopken U.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45122-45128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The data concerning constitutive signaling and constitutive internalization are consistent with the idea that US28 mimics the agonist occupied form of the receptor. In this respect, US28 appears to function quite similarly to cellular GPCRs except that it does so in the absence of agonist.Desensitization is a key regulatory mechanism required to control the magnitude and duration of GPCR signaling (1Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). The important factors in controlling desensitization are the GRKs and β-arrestins. Currently there are seven known GRKs (GRK1-GRK7) and four arrestins (β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, rod arrestin, and cone arrestin). The specificity of GRKs and arrestin family members for different receptors is just beginning to be ascertained, but it is clear that the limited number of GRK and arrestin proteins are responsible for regulating the much larger number of receptor proteins (32Sallese M. Lacovelli L. Storto M. De Blasi A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 168-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular GPCRs have differing numbers of GRK phosphorylation sites, and this appears to be important in the strength as well as duration of β-arrestin binding to receptor (33Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 34Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J.

The strength of β-arrestin binding will likely prove to be important in determining the relative sensitivity of different receptors to desensitization. This paradigm of GRK phosphorylation followed by β-arrestin recruitment leading to desensitization has been experimentally defined in biochemical experiments and in cultured cells and has recently been confirmed by studies using knockout and transgenic mice (35Bohn L.M.

It is unknown if traditional regulatory proteins such as GRKs and β-arrestins modulate US28 signaling. It has recently been demonstrated that US28 is constitutively phosphorylated in cells; however, it remains unknown if this phosphorylation leads to β-arrestin binding or directly affects signaling to downstream effectors such as inositol phosphate (31Mokros T. Rehm A. Droese J. Oppermann M. Lipp M. Hopken U.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45122-45128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in this study we examine the effects of GRK phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding on several aspects of US28 signaling. The data indicate that US28 interacts with GRK and β-arrestin proteins and that these interactions have multiple effects on US28-directed signal transmission.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). HEK-293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were routinely subcultured 1:5 two times weekly. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as above. Cells were routinely subcultured 1:10 three times weekly. HEK-293 cells were transfected in 100-mm dishes with 5 μg of total plasmid DNA using a modified calcium phosphate method. COS-7 cells were transfected in 100-mm dishes with 5 μg of total plasmid DNA and 20 μl of LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were routinely harvested 48 h post-transfection.Plasmids—The mammalian expression vector for US28 was derived from the HCMV strain VHL/E. The US28 cDNA is cloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector and contains an amino-terminal FLAG tag and prolactin signal peptide followed by the US28 open reading frame. The US28-(1–314), US28-(1–322), US28-(1–324), and US28-(1–332) mutants were constructed by PCR incorporating a stop codon and XbaI restriction enzyme site into the antisense primer. All sequences were confirmed using an automated ABI DNA sequencer (Howard Hughes Nucleic Acid Facility, Duke University). β-Arrestin 2 tagged with GFP was a kind gift of Marc Caron and Larry Barak (Duke University). pcDNA3-based expression plasmids for the β2AR and IL8R2 and pRK5-based expression plasmids for GRK2 and GRK5 have been described previously (41Fuchs S.Y.

The p38α expression plasmid was a kind gift of Roger J. Davis.Inositol Phosphate Accumulation—24 h post-transfection, cells were transferred to 12-well tissue culture plates and allowed to adhere. Cells were incubated for 18 h in complete medium containing 3 μCi/ml of [3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), washed once with PBS for 30 min, and incubated in PBS containing 20 mm LiCl (with or without 10 nm RANTES) for 3 h. Reactions were stopped by aspirating medium, adding 1 ml of 0.4 m perchloric acid, and cooling undisturbed at 4 °C for 5 min. 800 μl of supernatant was neutralized with 400 μl of 0.72 m KOH, 0.6 m KHCO3 and subjected to centrifugation. 1 ml of supernatant was diluted with 3 ml of distilled H2O and applied to freshly prepared Dowex columns (AG1-X8; Bio-Rad). Columns were washed two times with distilled H2O; total inositol phosphates were eluted with 4.0 ml of 0.1 m formic acid, 1 m ammonium formate; and eluates were counted in a liquid scintillation counter.[32P]Orthophosphate Labeling and Receptor Immunoprecipitations—48 h post-transfection, cells were starved in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 20 mm HEPES for 30 min. Cells were labeled with 250 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 120 min and either left unstimulated or stimulated with the appropriate ligand for 5 min. Intact cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, and whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride) for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C until use. FLAG-tagged receptors were immunopurified from the supernatant with 20 μl of M2 anti-FLAG affinity matrix (Sigma) for >3 h with constant rocking at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed three or four times in lysis buffer and diluted in 50 μl of 3× Laemmli sample buffer. Immunocomplexes (20 μl) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and dried gels were subjected to autoradiography.Immunoblotting and Detection of Phosphorylated p38α—48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested directly in 3× Laemmli sample buffer and briefly sonicated, and the cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell), and nonspecific reactivity was blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat dried milk. Antiserum directed against the phosphorylated form of p38 was used at a 1:1500 dilution in TBST to detect activated p38 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Reactive proteins were detected using the appropriate secondary antibodies in the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences).Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis of Cell Surface US28 Expression and Confocal Microscopy—Transfected cells were transferred into six-well dishes 24 h after transfection. 48 h after transfection, medium was aspirated, and cells were incubated with anti-FLAG primary antibody diluted 1:500 in PBS on ice for 2 h, washed once in PBS, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody diluted 1:250 in PBS on ice for 1 h. Cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% formaldehyde, and the presence of cell-surface receptors was determined by flow cytometry (Duke University Flow Cytometry Facility). For confocal microscopic localization of β-arrestin, HEK-293 cells were transfected with the appropriate combination of β-arrestin 2-GFP, US28, and GRK plasmids. 24 h after transfection, cells were transferred into collagen-coated glass bottom dishes. 48 h after transfection confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning microscope using a × 100/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion lens.RESULTSHCMV US28 Is Constitutively Phosphorylated in the Absence of Agonist—Stimulation of cellular GPCRs with agonist leads to a rapid and transient increase in signaling activity. The transient nature of this increase in signaling activity is due to the fact that activated receptors are strong targets for phosphorylation by GRK proteins and subsequent interaction with β-arrestin proteins. The interaction of GPCRs with these regulatory proteins leads to the dissociation of receptor from its cognate G-protein and effectively terminates signal transduction. Although the HCMV-encoded US28 GPCR has been shown to maintain strong constitutive signaling capacity in the absence of agonist, it remains unknown whether phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding regulate this signaling.To determine whether US28 signaling is regulated by phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding, we first analyzed its constitutive signaling activity. Since US28 appears to be predominantly coupled to Gαq proteins, we analyzed the ability of US28 to induce accumulation of inositol phosphates, a classical readout for Gαq signaling. US28 induces a 9.3-fold increase in the level of inositol phosphates when compared with mock-transfected HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1A, left panel). Stimulation with the CC chemokine RANTES has only a weak effect on the ability of US28 to induce inositol phosphate accumulation in HEK-293 cells. To analyze US28 phosphorylation, HEK-293 cells expressing US28, IL8R2, or β2AR were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with the appropriate ligand, and the receptors were immunoprecipitated. As expected, both the IL8R and the β2AR exhibited weak receptor phosphorylation that is strongly stimulated by agonist (Fig. 1A, right panel). Interestingly, US28 is strongly phosphorylated in the absence of exogenous ligand, and this phosphorylation appears to be unaffected by the β-chemokine RANTES.We also analyzed signaling and phosphorylation in COS-7 cells to determine whether constitutive phosphorylation of US28 was a general phenomenon or limited to HEK-293 cells. Similar to HEK-293 cells, US28 alone resulted in a 5.6-fold increase in inositol phosphate accumulation when compared with mock-transfected COS-7 cells. Stimulation with RANTES had a stronger effect on US28 signaling in COS-7 than in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1B, left panel). Analysis of US28 phosphorylation in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1B, right panel) demonstrated results similar to those obtained in HEK-293 cells, indicating that unlike its cellular counterparts, US28 is constitutively active and constitutively phosphorylated in the absence of agonist. Interestingly, whereas RANTES had a more dramatic effect on increasing the signaling capacity of US28 in COS-7 cells, we observed no discernible effect of RANTES on receptor phosphorylation. This result suggests that whereas RANTES can induce a conformation more suitable for signaling, this ligand-induced conformation is not a better substrate for phosphorylation.Overexpression of GRK2 and GRK5 Increases Constitutive Phosphorylation of US28 —Since a variety of cellular GPCRs are phosphorylated by GRKs, we set out to determine whether different members of the GRK family were capable of phosphorylating US28. GRK2 and GRK5 represent two types of GRKs that are present in mammalian cells. GRK2 contains several functional domains in addition to its catalytic core (Fig. 2A). The amino terminus contains a regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) homology domain and has been demonstrated to have Gαq binding capabilities, and the carboxyl terminus contains a pleckstrin homology domain that has been shown to be important in recruitment of GRK2 to the membrane (44Carman C.V.

Significantly, the entire spectrum of secreted proteins was increased when the hSec10 (human Sec10) component of the exocyst complex was overexpressed, suggestive of post-transcriptional regulation (Lipschutz, J. H., Guo, W., O'Brien, L. E., Nguyen, Y. H., Novick, P., and Mostov, K. E. (2000) Mol. Biol. Cell 11, 4259–4275). Here, using an exogenously transfected basolateral protein, the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), and a secretory protein, gp80, we show that pIgR and gp80 protein synthesis and delivery are increased in cells overexpressing Sec10 despite the fact that mRNA levels are unchanged, which is highly indicative of post-transcriptional regulation. To test specificity, we also examined the synthesis and delivery of an exogenous apical protein, CNT1 (concentrative nucleoside transporter 1), and found no increase in CNT1 protein synthesis, delivery, or mRNA levels in cells overexpressing Sec10. Sec10-GFP-overexpressing cell lines were created, and staining was seen in the endoplasmic reticulum. It was demonstrated previously in yeast that high levels of expression of SEB1, the Sec61β homologue, suppressed sec15-1, an exocyst mutant (Toikkanen, J., Gatti, E., Takei, K., Saloheimo, M., Olkkonen, V. M., Soderlund, H., De Camilli, P., and Keranen, S. (1996) Yeast 12, 425–438). Sec61β is a member of the Sec61 heterotrimer, which is the main component of the endoplasmic reticulum translocon. By co-immunoprecipitation we show that Sec10, which forms an exocyst subcomplex with Sec15, specifically associates with the Sec61β component of the translocon and that Sec10 overexpression increases the association of other exocyst complex members with Sec61β. Proteosome inhibition does not appear to be the mechanism by which increased protein synthesis occurs in the face of equivalent amounts of mRNA. Although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated, the exocyst/Sec61β interaction represents an important link between the cellular membrane trafficking and protein synthetic machinery. We previously showed that the exocyst complex specifically affected the synthesis and delivery of secretory and basolateral plasma membrane proteins. Significantly, the entire spectrum of secreted proteins was increased when the hSec10 (human Sec10) component of the exocyst complex was overexpressed, suggestive of post-transcriptional regulation (Lipschutz, J.

Proteins destined for secretion or delivery to the plasma membrane are translocated across the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) 1The abbreviations used are: RER, rough endoplasmic reticulum; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGN, trans-Golgi network; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; hSec10, human Sec10; IP3R3, type 3 inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor; pIgR, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CNT1, concentrative nucleoside transporter 1; SSO, suppressor of Sec1. 1The abbreviations used are: RER, rough endoplasmic reticulum; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGN, trans-Golgi network; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; hSec10, human Sec10; IP3R3, type 3 inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor; pIgR, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CNT1, concentrative nucleoside transporter 1; SSO, suppressor of Sec1. via the translocon in eukaryotic cells. After modification and folding, these proteins are then transported in vesicular carriers to the Golgi complex, and trans-Golgi network (TGN). From the TGN proteins can be sorted to several sites, including lysosomes, and to the plasma membrane for insertion or release into the extracellular space (3Palade G. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar, 4Gruss O.J. Feick P. Frank R. Dobberstein B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). There are several possible ways in which traffic through the secretory pathway is regulated. One of the best understood is the quality control machinery in the RER and Golgi. Proteins must properly fold and assemble before they can be efficiently exported. The rate and extent to which certain proteins reach the cell surface or are secreted are controlled by this mechanism (5Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). A second type of regulation is in dense core secretory granules. In the TGN of cells that contain such granules, certain proteins are selectively sorted into the granules, where they are stored. Upon receipt of an extracellular signal and elevation of intracellular free calcium, these granules can rapidly fuse with the plasma membrane, leading to the release of their contents (6Tooze S.A. Martens G.J. Huttner W.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 116-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). With the exception of these regulatory mechanisms, traffic through the secretory pathway is thought to proceed in a relatively constitutive manner. The amount of individual proteins that reach the cell surface, or are secreted, has therefore been thought to be regulated primarily at the level of mRNA transcription rather than at the level of the secretory pathway. Polarized epithelial cells have two distinct plasma membrane domains with very different protein compositions and functions: an apical domain comprising the luminal surface and a basolateral domain contacting adjoining and underlying cells. To establish and maintain their polarity, epithelial cells synthesize and then deliver specific proteins to the correct apical or basolateral plasma membrane (7Mostov K. Apodaca G. Aroeti B. Okamoto C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells represent one of the best studied polarized epithelial cell lines and are derived from canine renal tubular epithelium (8Simons K. Fuller S.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 295-340Crossref Scopus (556) Google Scholar). When grown on a permeable filter, MDCK cells form a well polarized epithelial monolayer, exhibiting apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains with unique compositions (9Leighton J. Estes L.W. Mansukhani S. Brada Z. Cancer. 1970; 26: 1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 10Rindler M.J. Chuman L.M. Shaffer L. Saier M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 81: 635-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and well defined cell-cell junctional complexes containing tight junctions (11Gumbiner B. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C749-C758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are circumstances in which the cell might need to regulate the level of whole classes of proteins, such as those found in the plasma membrane or in particular in the basolateral plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells. For example, cells must often alter their shape, polarization, and other characteristics during development and differentiation, and this plasticity could require the coordinate regulation of large classes of proteins. We have experience with two in vitro models where polarized epithelial cells coordinately regulate the abundance of all of the proteins at their basolateral plasma membrane. First, when these cells are dissociated by trypsin and EDTA and then plated in culture, the cells are initially relatively flat. As the cells establish contacts and confluency, they become columnar and their lateral surfaces increase greatly. This process resembles the polarization of epithelial cells that occurs during normal development. Second, when MDCK cells are grown in three-dimensional collagen gels, they form hollow cysts lined by a monolayer of cells with their apical surfaces facing the center (12O'Brien L.E. Jou T.S. Pollack A.L. Zhang Q. Hansen S.H. Yurchenco P. Mostov K.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Addition of hepatocyte growth factor causes the cells to first send out long extensions of their basolateral plasma membrane, which requires an increase in basolateral surface area. Eventually, cells migrate out and reorganize into tubules in a process resembling tubulogenesis in vivo (13O'Brien L.E. Zegers M.M. Mostov K.E. Nat. Rev Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 14Pollack A.L. Runyan R.B. Mostov K.E. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 64-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). One candidate for a component of the machinery in this process is the exocyst (or Sec6-Sec8) complex, first identified as being involved in the exocytosis of vesicles in yeast (15Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). The exocyst is a 750-kDa complex comprised of Sec3p, Sec5p, Sec6p, Sec8p, Sec10p, Sec15p, Exo70p, and Exo84p (16Terbush D.R. Maurice T. Roth D. Novick P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6483-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 17Guo W. Grant A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In yeast (and probably mammals), Sec10p and Sec15p exist as a subcomplex within the greater exocyst complex. This Sec10-Sec15 subcomplex acts as a bridge between the Rab GTPase Sec4p, found on the surface of the secretory vesicles carrying polarized proteins, and the rest of the exocyst complex, which is in contact with the plasma membrane (18Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In permeabilized MDCK cells, antibodies to the Sec6 and Sec8 subunits inhibit delivery of at least one basolateral protein to this surface but do not affect the delivery of at least one apical protein to the apical surface (19Grindstaff K.K. Yeaman C. Anandasabapathy N. Hsu S. Rodriguez-Boulan R. Scheller R.H. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 731-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that overexpression of the human homologue of Sec10, hSec10, in MDCK cells resulted in multiple effects. (i) Polarized hSec10-overexpressing cells grown on a two-dimensional Transwell filters were significantly taller, but not wider, than control cells, suggesting an increased basolateral surface area and protein delivery. (ii) hSec10 overexpression specifically resulted in increased synthesis and delivery of endogenous basolateral plasma membrane proteins as well as secretory proteins, compared with control cells, as determined by pulse-chase experiments on filter-grown cells. (iii) hSec10-overexpressing cells in a three-dimensional collagen gel system formed cysts much more rapidly and efficiently than did control cells. When these cysts were stimulated with hepatocyte growth factor, they produced more tubules than did cysts made up of control cells (1Lipschutz J.H. Guo W. O'Brien L.E. Nguyen Y.H. Novick P. Mostov K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4259-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These pleiotropic morphologic responses probably reflect an underlying increase in the synthesis of endogenous basolateral plasma membrane proteins and the consequent expansion of the basolateral surface area. We are less certain of the consequences of the increase in synthesis of the entire spectrum of major secretory proteins that are released into the apical and basolateral media. Our initial interpretation of these data was that, most likely, the increase in production of secretory and basolateral plasma membrane proteins was produced by the coordinated transcriptional up-regulation of all of these proteins. However, because these proteins have very different functions and are probably under the control of diverse transcriptional regulatory networks, this argues against a transcriptional model. For instance, the major secretory protein in MDCK cells is gp80 (20Urban J. Parczyk K. Leutz A. Kayne M. Kondor-Koch C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), a protein with 80% homology to rat-sulfated glycoprotein 2 (SGP-2). SGP-2 is the major protein secreted by rat Sertoli cells and is presumably under complex hormonal control (21Collard M.W. Griswold M.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3297-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22Hartmann K. Rauch J. Urban J. Parczyk K. Diel P. Pilarsky C. Appel D. Haase W. Mann K. Weller A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9924-9931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). What these basolateral plasma membrane and secretory proteins have in common, however, is they all transit through the secretory pathway. Regulation of their transit through the secretory pathway could be a facile means of regulating the abundance of these proteins. The translocon, or protein-conducting pore in the RER through which newly made proteins are translocated into or across the RER membrane, consists of three main subunits, Sec61α,-β, and -γ (23Kinch L.N. Saier Jr., M.H. Grishin N.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 170-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 25Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). While the Sec61α subunit is primarily responsible for translocation, much less is known about the Sec61β subunit. It is not required for translocation of all proteins in reconstituted liposomes or for viability in yeast, but it does facilitate translocation (26Kalies K.U. Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Seb1p is a yeast homologue of Sec61β. Intriguingly, SEB1 was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the sec15-1 mutation, and, given that Sec15 is a component of the exocyst complex, this implies at least a genetic interaction of the exocyst and translocon (2Toikkanen J. Gatti E. Takei K. Saloheimo M. Olkkonen V.M. Soderlund H. De Camilli P. Keranen S. Yeast. 1996; 12: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we test the hypothesis that the exocyst is involved in the regulation of traffic through the secretory pathway, especially in coordination of events at the plasma membrane with events earlier in the secretory pathway, specifically those at the translocon. We present data showing that exocyst overexpression, despite unchanged mRNA levels, increases synthesis of basolateral and secretory, but not apical, proteins and biochemical evidence that the exocyst associates with Sec61β. We propose that this association is one mechanism by which exocyst overexpression leads to an increase in secretory and basolateral protein synthesis. Cell Culture—MDCK type II cells overexpressing hSec10 (1Lipschutz J.H. Guo W. O'Brien L.E. Nguyen Y.H. Novick P. Mostov K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4259-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and control MDCK cells were maintained in minimum essential medium containing Earle's balanced salt solution, supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2, 95% air. Antibodies/Reagents—Monoclonal mouse anti-rat Sec6 and Sec8 antibody was used at 1:500 for Western blot and 1:100 for immunofluorescence (StressGen). Type 3 inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R3) monoclonal antibody was used at 1:100 for immunofluorescence (Transduction Laboratories). Monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies were used at 1:1000 for Western blot. Sec61β antibodies were used at 1:500 for Western blot. For immunofluorescence Alexa 594 secondary antibody was used at 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Goat anti-mouse HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was the secondary antibody used for Western blots (1:15,000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Northern Blot—MDCK cells overexpressing Sec10 and the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) or just pIgR were grown on Transwell filters for 6–7 days as described (27Lipschutz J.H. O'Brien L.E.

The RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and blotted in standard fashion (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. AAAAMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3.

Adenovirus Production—The tetracycline-regulated promoter has been subcloned from the tetracycline-inducible expression plasmid pUHD10–3 to pAdlox (29Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y.

Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) 3′ to the Ψ5 packaging site and 5′ to the poly(A) site, replacing the original cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter with the regulated tetracycline promoter (30Altschuler Y. Barbas S.M. Terlecky L.J. Tang K. Hardy S. Mostov K. Schmid S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1871-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Full-length hSec10 was then cloned into the adenovirus vector just downstream of the tetracycline/minimal CMV promoter. In the presence of doxycycline, a tetracycline derivative, expression of hSec10 is tightly repressed. To examine the function of the adenoviral constructs, a Western blot was performed using antibodies against the Myc epitope tag, which confirmed hSec10-myc overexpression. As a further validation of both the function of our recombinant adenovirus and the experiment shown in Fig. 1a, increased pIgR protein synthesis was seen with an [35S]methionine pulse in cells infected with just hSec10-myc adenovirus and tetracycline transactivator (tta) adenovirus compared with control cells infected with hSec10-myc adenovirus, tta adenovirus, and doxycycline (data not shown). Generation of Sec10-GFP and Transfection—The cDNA coding for hSec10 was cloned into the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) vector (Clontech) and then transfected into MDCK cells using a calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (1Lipschutz J.H.

Synthesis, Delivery, and Secretion Assays—MDCK type II cells constitutively expressing the basolateral protein pIgR and either overexpressing hSec10 or an empty vector from a confluent 100-mm plastic dish were trypsinized, and 5% of the cells in the dish were seeded/12 mm (0.4-μm pore size) Transwell filter (Costar). The cells were grown for 6–7 days with fresh medium added daily and allowed to grow to confluency as determined by hydrostatic pressure testing (27Lipschutz J.H. O'Brien L.E. Altschuler Y.

After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were starved for 20 min in minimum essential medium lacking cysteine and then labeled by exposing the basolateral surface to a 25-μl drop of starvation medium containing 4 μl of [35S]-cysteine (31.4 μCi/μl, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 20 min. After pulsing with 35S-cysteine for 20 min, cells were lysed in 0.5% SDS, equal volumes of 2.5% Triton X-100 were added, and immunoprecipitation was performed using antibody against pIgR. The immunoprecipitate was then run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). For the synthesis and delivery assays of the apical plasma membrane protein CNT1, MDCK cells constitutively overexpressing pIgR and CNT1-GFP were grown on 12-mm Transwell filters for 6 days. 24 h before the pulse-chase was performed, all of the Transwells received 3 μl of tetracycline transactivator and 3 μl of Sec10 virus stock corresponding to ∼15 plaque-forming units/cell of recombinant adenovirus in 2 ml of binding medium (Hanks' salt solution containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) for 1 h at 37 °C to enable viral attachment and infection as described (30Altschuler Y.

Half of the Transwell filters also received doxycyline at 20 ng/ml to repress expression of Sec10. The synthesis and delivery assays were then performed as described above, except [35S]methionine was substituted for 35S-cysteine, using anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science) to immunoprecipitate CNT1-GFP. For the secretion/proteosome inhibitor assays, half of the Transwell filters containing hSec10-overexpressing cells were treated with the proteosome inhibitor MG132 (Calbiochem) for 1 h at 25 μm as described previously (31Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). The cells were labeled as described above and washed extensively, and minimum essential medium was added (0.3 ml apically and 0.5 ml basolaterally) and collected at 60 min, run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). All experiments were repeated at least three times and were reproducible. Western blot/Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in 1% N-octylglucosid (Roche Applied Science) and prepared in standard fashion (32Breitfeld P.P. Casanova J.E. Simister N.E. Ross S.A. McKinnon W.C. Mostov K.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1989; 1: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed using 4–8 μg of antibody against Myc, Sec6, Sec8, or Sec61β per immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitate was then run on SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were detected by incubations with the same Myc antibody (1:500) or Sec61β (1:500) followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) as the secondary antibody (1:15,000), and ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde as described previously (1Lipschutz J.H. Guo W. O'Brien L.E.

Nonspecific binding sites were blocked and the cells permeabilized using 0.7% fish skin gelatin and 0.025% saponin. Samples were placed in medium containing antibody to IP3R3 (Transduction Laboratories). After extensive washing, the samples were incubated in blocking buffer containing Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody, 1:200 dilution (Molecular Probes). Cells were postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and mounted. Confocal images were collected using a krypton-argon laser (Bio-Rad 1024). Statistics—Unitless PhosphorImager counts in Figs. 1 and 6 were significant within an experiment but not between experiments. For all statistics reported, the average and standard deviations were performed using Excel (Microsoft) software. Overexpression of hSec10 Causes Increased Synthesis of Exogenous Basolateral, but Not Apical, Proteins—We have shown previously that hSec10 overexpression increased synthesis and delivery of all major secretory proteins and the endogenous basolateral protein E-cadherin but not the endogenous apical protein gp135 (1Lipschutz J.H. Guo W. O'Brien L.E. Nguyen Y.H. Novick P. Mostov K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4259-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Other groups, although not looking at synthesis or secretion, have shown that the exocyst specifically affects basolateral protein delivery to the cell surface (19Grindstaff K.K. Yeaman C. Anandasabapathy N. Hsu S. Rodriguez-Boulan R. Scheller R.H. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 731-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 33Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As noted, the fact that all of the major secretory proteins were increased (and by approximately the same degree) made a coordinated transcriptional effect seem unlikely, given the diversity of transcriptional regulation. As a first step to test whether the effect of hSec10 on synthesis of basolateral plasma membrane proteins was transcriptional or post-transcriptional, a pCB7 plasmid containing cDNA encoding an exogenous basolateral protein, pIgR, was transfected into the MDCK parent cell line prior to transfection of hSec10. We found increased synthesis of the exogenous basolateral pIgR in hSec10-overexpressing cells compared with control cells (Fig. 1a). We also found increased pIgR protein delivery to the basolateral plasma membrane at a degree corresponding to the increase in protein synthesis (data not shown). In the pCB7 plasmid, pIgR cDNA was driven off a CMV promoter. This cDNA was engineered to contain minimal 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (no introns or likely regulatory elements) (35Deitcher D.L. Neutra M.R. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The CMV promoter itself is a very strong and constitutively active promoter in MDCK cells (27Lipschutz J.H. O'Brien L.E. Altschuler Y. Avrahami D. Nguyen Y.H. Tang K. Mostov K. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Harford J.B. Yamada K.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ2001: 15.5Google Scholar). There is no a priori reason to suspect that the CMV promoter should be regulated by hSec10 or the exocyst. We had previously transfected the same MDCK cells, stably overexpressing pIgR, with a pcDNA3 plasmid containing cDNA encoding CNT1, an apical protein. The pcDNA3 plasmid also utilizes the CMV promoter. Stable cell lines expressing CNT1 with a green fluorescence protein (GFP) tag were created, and it was confirmed that CNT1-GFP localized to the apical plasma membrane and that the GFP tag did not alter substrate selectivity (36Mangravite L.M. Lipschutz J.H. Mostov K.E. Giacomini K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F879-F885PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line constitutively expressing the apical CNT1-GFP allowed us to perform an experiment similar to the one described above for the basolateral protein pIgR. However, to perform this experiment we used the approach of infecting the cells with a recombinant adenovirus encoding hSec10. The adenoviral approach was necessary because we were limited by the number of selection markers that could be used for transfection in this cell line (i.e. the CNT1-GFP cell line had already been transfected with plasmids encoding pIgR and CNT1-GFP). The recombinant adenovirus was constructed so tha"

For the enzymes from Bacillus cereus (BcII) and Aeromonas hydrophila (CphA), we found that the mononuclear enzymes are the favored targets for inhibition. By combining results from extended x-ray absorption fine structure, perturbed angular correlation of γ-rays spectroscopy, and a study of metal ion binding, we derived that for Cd(II)1-BcII, the thiolate sulfur of d-captopril binds to the metal ion located at the site defined by three histidine ligand residues. This is also the case for the inhibited Co(II)1 and Co(II)2 enzymes as observed by UV-visible spectroscopy. Although the single metal ion in Cd(II)1-BcII is distributed between both available binding sites in both the uninhibited and the inhibited enzyme, Cd(II)1-CphA shows only one defined ligand geometry with the thiolate sulfur coordinating to the metal ion in the site composed of 1 Cys, 1 His, and 1 Asp. CphA shows a strong preference for d-captopril, which is also reflected in a very rigid structure of the complex as determined by perturbed angular correlation spectroscopy. For BcII and CphA, which are representatives of the metallo-β-lactamase subclasses B1 and B2, we find two different inhibitor binding modes. d- and l-captopril are competitive inhibitors of metallo-β-lactamases.

Metallo-β-lactamases confer antibiotic resistance to bacteria by catalyzing the hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems. This relatively new form of resistance is spreading and thereby escaping the effective inhibitors developed to fight the better known serine-β-lactamases. For all metallo-β-lactamases investigated, structurally similar enzyme active sites comprising two zinc binding sites are reported. For Bacillus cereus metallo-β-lactamase (BcII), 1The abbreviations used are: BcII, metallo-β-lactamase from B. cereus; CphA, metallo-β-lactamase from A. hydrophila; PAC, perturbed angular correlation of γ-rays; EXAFS, extended x-ray absorption fine structure; H-site, zinc binding site composed of three histidine residues in subclass B1; DCH site, zinc binding site composed of asparagine, cysteine, and histidine; NQI, nuclear quadrupole interaction; XAS, x-ray absorption spectroscopy. one metal-binding site contains three His (H-site); the other one contains 1 Asp, 1 Cys, and 1 His as the metal ligating residues (DCH site) as derived from x-ray crystallography (1Carfi A.

For CphA, 1 His from the H-site (His-116) is supposed to be replaced by an Asn (2Massidda O. Rossolini G.M. Satta G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4611-4617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various thiol-carboxylate compounds were identified as potent inhibitors (3Payne D.J. Du W. Bateson J.H. Expert. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2000; 9: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The active site binding of thiomandelic acid to BcII was studied by NMR spectroscopy (4Mollard C. Moali C. Papamicael C. Damblon C. Vessilier S. Amicosante G. Schofield C.J. Galleni M. Frere J.M.

Both studies agree in a bridging role of the metal-bound sulfur of the inhibitor, whereas the carboxylate group of the inhibitors binds to an accessible amino acid, thus stabilizing the complex. Other known inhibitory compounds are 2,3-(S,S)-disubstituted succinic acids for IMP-1 (6Toney J.H. Hammond G.G. Fitzgerald P.M. Sharma N. Balkovec J.M. Rouen G.P. Olson S.H. Hammond M.L.

The latter compounds lead to irreversible inactivation of the enzyme by the hydrolyzed reaction products. The structural investigation of d- and gl-captopril binding presented here is based on results obtained from enzyme kinetic and thermodynamic studies. Captopril is known as an angiotensin converting enzyme-blocking agent used in the therapy of blood pressure diseases. Although different catalytic mechanisms for mono- and binuclear metallo-β-lactamases have been discussed in the literature, it is still not clearly understood why the enzymes have two conserved metal binding sites (for review, see Ref. 8Wang Z. Fast W. Valentine A.M. Benkovic S.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The motivation for the present investigation was the demand for a better knowledge of the nature of metal ion binding in the presence of bound ligands. By a combination of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and perturbed angular correlation of γ-rays (PAC) spectroscopy, we studied the nature of captopril interactions with the cadmium-substituted enzymes (detailed descriptions of the methods can be found in Refs. 9Teo B.K. EXAFS: Basic principles and Data Analysis. Springer, Berlin1986Crossref Google Scholar and 10Paul-Soto R. Zeppezauer M. Adolph H.W. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Carfi A. Dideberg O. Wouters J. Hemmingsen L.

Both methods delivered consistent results that are additionally supported by UV-visible spectroscopic results of Co(II)-substituted enzymes. The present investigation contributes new insights with respect to the physiological importance of mono- and binuclear metallo-β-lactamases. The metallo-β-lactamases CphA from Aeromonas hydrophila AE036 and BcII from B. cereus 569/H/9 were purified as described (11Hernandez Valladares M. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Felici A. Perilli M.

The protein concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 30,500 m–1 cm–1 for BcII 569/H/9 and 38,000 m–1 cm–1 for CphA. Metal ion concentrations in samples and in the final dialysis buffers were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy in the flame mode as described (13Hernandez V.M. Felici A. Weber G. Adolph H.W. Zeppezauer M. Rossolini G.M. Amicosante G. Frere J.M. Galleni M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11534-11541Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To produce “metal-free” buffers, buffer solutions in bidistilled water were treated by extensive stirring with Chelex 100 (Sigma). Apo-enzymes were prepared by dialysis of the corresponding enzymes against two changes of 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl and 20 mm EDTA over 12 h under stirring. EDTA was removed from the resulting apoenzyme solution by three dialysis steps against the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl and Chelex-100 and finally two dialysis steps against 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl and Chelex-100. In all preparations, the residual zinc content did not exceed 5% as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. To synthesize d-captopril (Scheme 1), we prepared compound 1 according to the procedure described in Ref. 14Suh J.T. Skiles J.W. Williams B.E. Youssefyeh R.D. Jones H. Loev B. Neiss E.S. Schwab A.

The photometric measurements were performed with either a spectrophotometer (CphA) or the stopped-flow system DX-17MV (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) in those cases where high concentrations of enzymes (0.1–1 μm) during the measurements were required to exactly define the reconstitution state of the metallo-enzymes. Under such conditions, it was possible to study Zn(II)1- and Cd(II)1-BcII with apo-enzyme reconstituted with only 0.1 equivalents of metal without the interference of residual zinc in the metal-depleted buffers. The data evaluation was based on the concentration of metal ions added. Effects of residual zinc in the solutions could be minimized, and it was possible to clearly discriminate Me1 and Me2 species. The steady-state parameters Km and kcat and the inhibition constants for d- and l-captopril were determined from initial rates. Standard non-linear regression analysis was used for data evaluation by directly fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation (uninhibited or competitively inhibited) to the data. Activities of binuclear enzymes were studied with enzyme samples in the presence of excess of the respective metal ions. Inhibition constants for d- and l-captopril were determined by the variation of the inhibitor concentration at substrate concentrations fixed in the range of the respective Km values. UV-visible spectra of Co(II)-substituted BcII were recorded with a Lambda9 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and processed with the UV-Winlab software from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Co(II)1-BcII was prepared by reconstitution of 130 μm apo-enzyme with 120 μm Co(II). Co(II)2-BcII was prepared by preincubation of 118 μm apo-BcII with 500 μm Co(II). To remove traces of precipitated protein, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 30,000 × g immediately before the measurement. The d-captopril complexes were obtained by adding 800 μmd-captopril to the sample cells. The dissociation constants for a first (Kmono) and second (Kbi) cadmium ion bound to BcII in presence of 25 μmd-captopril and 0.1 m NaCl were obtained from competition experiments with the chromophoric chelator Mag-fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, as described previously (17de Seny D.

X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) Sample Preparation—The buffer used during purification has been exchanged for 20 mm bis-Tris, pH 7, by iterative use of Millipore Centricon devices to decrease scattering background. The final protein concentration was ∼2–3 mm. The free metal concentration was below 2 μm. Samples have been frozen and stored at –20 °C. XAS Measurements—For XAS, about 100–120 μl of enzyme solution were transferred to the EXAFS cuvettes covered with Kapton tape (DuPont) as an x-ray transparent window material, capped, mounted on the sample holder, dropped into liquid nitrogen, and transferred to the beamline cryostat. The Cadmium-K edge (26,711.0 eV) XAS was collected at the beamline D2 at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (European Molecular Biology Laboratory outstation, Hamburg, Germany) running at 4.4 GeV and 70–125 mA current in fluorescence mode at 25 K sample temperature. An internal cadmium foil sample was used for calibration. XAS Data Analysis—Standard EXAFS analysis was performed using the EXPROG software package (developed by C. Hermes and H. F. Nolting at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-Outstation/Hamburg, Germany) to process the raw data and EXCURV98 (developed by N. Binsted, S. W. Cambell, S. J. Gurman, and P. Stepherson at Science and Engineering Research Council, Daresbury, UK) using exact curve wave scattering theory (19Lee P.A. Pendry J.B. Physiol.

The energy range was set to 30–650 eV above the edge. Phases were calculated ab initio using Hedin-Lundqvist potentials and von Barth ground states (21Hedin L. Lundqvist S. Solid State Phys. 1969; 23: 1-181Google Scholar). Both single and multiple scattering paths up to 4.5 Å from the metal atom were used to identify and quantify imidazole coordination of histidine ligands by using implemented small molecule data base of the program. After eliminating all non-imidazole atoms of the His unit, the complete imidazole ring was simulated by iterating the distance and Debye-Waller factor of the pivotal (directly coordinating) N atom and the angle φ of the second imidazole N atom for slight distance corrections of the constrained outer shell imidazole atoms. Debye-Waller factors of the outer shell atoms of imidazole rings were constrained assuming the Debye-Waller factors of atoms with similar distance to the absorber to be equal. Since the constraints for the Debye-Waller factors are unique for each parameter set, details are summarized in Tables II and III.Table IIResults of the theoretical EXAFS data analysisfor BcII Open table in a new tab Table IIIResults of the theoretical EXAFS data analysis for CphAView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The fitting process included additional constraints for the following parameters. Two coordination clusters were introduced, each having an integer number of ligands. The fit then determined the fractional occupancy of each cluster for the mononuclear enzyme if the metal ions were distributed between the two metal sites. Theoretical simulations were generated by adding shells of scatterers around the central cadmium atoms and iterating the number of scatterers, bond lengths, and Debye-Waller factors in each shell. Additionally, the Fermi energy Ef (edge position relative to calculated vacuum position) was refined to achieve the best fit to the experimental data. The improvement of the fit after the addition of each shell beyond the first was assessed by comparing the residual R-factor (22Joyner R.W. Martin K.J. Meehan P. J. Phys.

In the case of identical, static, and randomly oriented molecules, the perturbation function G2(t) is shown in Equation 1, G2(t)=a0+a1cos(ω1t)+a2cos(ω2t)+a3cos(ω3t)(Eq. 1) with ω1, ω2, and ω3 as the three difference frequencies between the three sublevels of the spin 52 state of the cadmium nucleus (25Bauer R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1985; 18: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Note that ω1 + ω2 = ω3. Thus, the Fourier transform of G2(t) exhibits three frequencies for each nuclear quadrupole interaction (NQI). The Fourier transformation was performed as described in Ref. 24Bauer R. Danielsen E. Hemmingsen L. Sorensen M.V. Ulstrup J. Friis E.P. Auld D.S. Bjerrum M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11514-11524Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar. The NQI is characterized by the numerically largest diagonal element after diagonalization, chosen as ωzz, which is denoted ω0 and η = (ωxx – ωyy)/ωzz. The relation between these two parameters and the frequencies in G2(t) can be found in Ref. 23Hemmingsen L. Bauer R. Bjerrum M.J. Adolph H.W. Zeppezauer M. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar. Thus, from the time dependence of G2(t), ω0 and η, determined through least squares fitting, reflect the coordination geometry of the cadmium ion. In the liquid state, the NQI is time-dependent because of the Brownian reorientation of the protein, described by the rotational diffusion time τR. This has the consequence that G2(t) converges to 0 as a function of time, representing thermal equilibrium and isotropy in the angular correlation between the two γ-rays. The perturbation function A2G2(t), where A2 is the amplitude, was analyzed by a conventional non-linear least squares fitting routine. Satisfactory fitting was obtained with a relative Gaussian distribution δ = Δω0/ω0 applied to all the three frequencies. Non-zero values for δ indicate that the 111mCd nuclei are located in a distribution of surroundings. An NQI is then described by the parameters ω0, η, δ, and τR. In cases where more than a single NQI is present, the perturbation function is the sum of the different perturbation functions, where each NQI is weighted by its population (23Hemmingsen L. Bauer R.

We have studied the interaction of metallo-β-lactamases with the two diastereomers of captopril, which proved to be competitive inhibitors of both BcII and CphA. Inhibition constants of d- and l-captopril for Me1- and Me2-BcII were determined with imipenem as the substrate (Table I). Since it was not possible to yield reasonable results for the putative binuclear species of CphA, only results for the mononuclear species are presented.Table IEnzymatic activities with imipenem and inhibition constants of d- and l-captopril for Zn(II) and CD(II)-substituted BcII and CphAOrganismMetalsKMkcatkcat/KMKiD-CaptoprilKiL-CaptoprilμMs-1s-1 μM-1μMμMBCIIZn(II)173 ± 10127 ± 71.7444 ± 561 ± 5BCIIZn(II)2330 ± 30276 ± 200.8445 ± 565 ± 5BCIICd(II)1820 ± 393.3 ± 0.80.0040.5 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.2BCIICd(II)2888 ± 750.6 ± 0.030.0006818 ± 125 ± 3CphAZn(II)1100aData published in Ref. 27.625aData published in Ref. 27.6.2572 ± 6950 ± 80CphACd(II)135.5aData published in Ref. 27.0.54aData published in Ref. 27.0.0152.7 ± 0.419 ± 2a Data published in Ref. 27Hernandez V.M.

In the presence of 25 μmd-captopril and 5 μm BcII, a first Cd(II) ion binds with a KD of 1.6 nm as compared with 8.3 nm in absence of d-captopril (18Hemmingsen L. Damblon C. Antony J. Jensen M. Adolph H.W. Wommer S. Roberts G.C. Bauer R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 10329-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A second cadmium ion is bound with a KD of 50 μm as compared with 5.9 μm in the absence of the inhibitor (18Hemmingsen L. Damblon C. Antony J. Jensen M. Adolph H.W. Wommer S. Roberts G.C. Bauer R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 10329-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These KD values are macroscopic constants, and in case of the mononuclear enzymes, they do not reflect any binding site assignment (see below). For CphA, the substitution of cadmium for zinc results in a drastic decrease of Km and kcat. Binding of captopril is much stronger to the cadmium species than to the zinc species with a strong preference for d-captopril (Table I). UV-visible Spectroscopy—Binding of Co(II) to the metal-free enzyme at a [Co(II)]/[enzyme] stoichiometry of 0.8 results in the appearance of a ligand-to-metal charge transfer band at 344 nm and bands in the d-d transition region (400–700 nm). In general, the intensity of the ligand-to-metal charge transfer bands is mainly due to Cys (sulfur)-Co(II) interaction, whereas the d-d transitions are caused by the His-Co(II) interaction (17de Seny D. Heinz U. Wommer S. Kiefer M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Bauer R. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45065-45078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Increasing the [Co(II)]/[enzyme] ratio above 1 results in a shift of the charge transfer band to 383 nm (Fig. 1) (17de Seny D. Heinz U. Wommer S. Kiefer M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Bauer R. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45065-45078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Besides this difference, the d-d regions are almost identical in shape and intensity at low and high stoichiometry of Co(II) relative to the enzyme. A similar H-site occupancy at low and high stoichiometry reflects a strong preference of Co(II) for the H-site in Co(II)1-BcII (17de Seny D. Heinz U. Wommer S. Kiefer M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Bauer R. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45065-45078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Binding of d-captopril to Co(II)-BcII leads to changes both in the charge transfer region and in the d-d region, indicating the binding of an additional ligand and likely changes in the coordination geometry of both sites. The difference spectra between inhibitor-bound and free enzyme at low and high stoichiometry are very similar in the charge transfer region and virtually identical in the d-d region, indicating that the modes of binding for d-captopril to Co(II) are also almost identical at both metal stoichiometries (Fig. 1). It has to be emphasized, however, that even under the conditions used for the Co(II)2-BcII experiments (Fig. 1A), the enzyme was not completely available as the Co(II)2 species. Even at the very high concentration of Co(II) used, a fraction of the enzyme still shows the charge transfer band for the mononuclear enzyme at 348 nm, and thus 10–20% of the enzyme still had Co(II) bound only in the DCH site. Thus, a direct quantitative comparison of absorption coefficients of Co(II)1 and Co(II)2 enzyme is difficult and, thus, a quantitative estimate of relative occupancies of both binding sites for the mononuclear enzyme. EXAFS Spectroscopy—For EXAFS spectroscopy on BcII and CphA, ∼0.8 eq of Cd(II)/enzyme were used to minimize contributions from the eventually formed binuclear species. A 3-fold surplus of d-captopril was added to maximize the abundance of the inhibited species. The EXAFS results are given in Tables II and III for BcII and CphA, respectively. The corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 2. To illustrate the fitting procedure used, Table II shows two alternative models used for simulation of the spectra for uninhibited Cd(II)1-BcII, namely a 1-cluster and a 2-cluster model. Since it is well known that a single cadmium ion is distributed between the two available binding sites (10Paul-Soto R. Zeppezauer M. Adolph H.W. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Carfi A. Dideberg O. Wouters J. Hemmingsen L. Bauer R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16500-16506Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Hemmingsen L. Damblon C. Antony J. Jensen M. Adolph H.W. Wommer S. Roberts G.C. Bauer R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 10329-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), a typical 1-cluster model necessarily results in an “averaged” ligand sphere. From the coordination numbers resulting for the 1-cluster model, it becomes obvious that neither the 3-His nor the DCH site is fully occupied (NS ∼0.4; NN/imidazole ∼2.02). The fractional occupation of the DCH site (∼40%) leads to a theoretical value of ∼2.2 for NN/imidazole, which is in contradiction to the simulated value of NN/imidazole ∼2.02. The resulting lack of intensity in the theoretical spectrum is compensated by an added broad contribution of oxygen ligands (high NO and very high Debye-Waller factor) in this simple model. If multiple scattering contributions of histidines are not taken into account, the result becomes even more corrupted by not using constrained imidazole ring units since contributions from nitrogen or oxygen ligands are virtually identical (data not shown). Also, second shell contributions were omitted, which is clearly reflected in the lack in intensity at ∼3.2 Å (Fig. 2C) of the theoretical spectrum. Since the amino acid ligand geometry is well known for BcII from x-ray crystallographic data (Protein Data Bank code 1BVT), we could make use of these data by constructing a 2-cluster model. The atomic distribution in the 2 cluster model was accordingly assigned (3-His and DCH site, respectively). Thus, the problem of correlated coordination numbers and Debye-Waller factors could be solved by fixing the ligand coordination numbers according to the structural data derived from the Protein Data Bank file 1BVT. Thus, the only free remaining coordination number in the 2-cluster model is the one of the cadmium ion itself, which determines the fractional occupation of each cluster. Additionally second shell nitrogen/oxygen ligands with a fixed coordination number were introduced to account for back scattering contributions in the ∼3.2-Å range. For the 2-cluster model, an occupation of 70% results for the H-site. Interestingly the ligand specific distances found are in good agreement with the values obtained with the 1-cluster model. All attempts to generate theoretical spectra with 1-cluster models for the d-captopril-inhibited enzyme (with exactly the same method as used for the uninhibited enzyme) failed in the sense that useful data could not be obtained due to mutual dependences of parameters. Although low R-factors could be obtained, Debye-Waller factors and coordination numbers resulted in unrealistic values (data not shown). In the theoretical 2-cluster model for the d-captopril-inhibited enzyme, it proved to be possible to replace the second shell nitrogen/oxygen contributions in the DCH site by introducing a small molecule model of the Asp side chain. Again, all coordination numbers except the coordination number of Cd(II) in both available binding sites were fixed. The resulting distribution of Cd(II) for the inhibited species shows a 60% occupation of the DCH site. The ligand geometry of Cd(II)1-BcII is roughly similar to th"

Cell cycle control in Trypanosoma brucei was analyzed in the present study. Genes encoding four PHO80 cyclin homologues and three B-type cyclin homologues but no G1 cyclin homologues were identified in this organism. Through knocking down expression of the seven cyclin genes with the RNA interference technique in the procyclic form of T. brucei, we demonstrated that one PHO80 homologue (CycE1/CYC2) and a B-type cyclin homologue (CycB2) are the essential cyclins regulating G1/S and G2/M transitions, respectively. This lack of overlapping cyclin function differs significantly from that observed in the other eukaryotes. Also, PHO80 cyclin is known for its involvement only in phosphate signaling in yeast with no known function in cell cycle control. Both observations thus suggest the presence of simple and novel cell cycle regulators in trypanosomes. T. brucei cells deficient in CycE1/CYC2 displayed a long slender morphology, whereas those lacking CycB2 assumed a fat stumpy form. These cells apparently still can undergo cytokinesis generating small numbers of anucleated daughter cells, each containing a single kinetoplast known as a zoid. Two different types of zoids were identified, the slender zoid derived from reduced CycE1/CYC2 expression and the stumpy zoid from CycB2 deficiency. This observation indicates an uncoupling between the kinetoplast and the nuclear cycle, resulting in cell division driven by kinetoplast segregation with neither a priori S phase nor mitosis in the trypanosome.

The eukaryotic cell cycle is governed by multiple regulatory proteins, such as the cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; RNAi, RNA interference; RT, reverse transcription; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FACScan, FACS scan; 1N1K, one nucleus and one kinetoplast; CRK, cdc2-related kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; RNAi, RNA interference; RT, reverse transcription; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FACScan, FACS scan; 1N1K, one nucleus and one kinetoplast; CRK, cdc2-related kinase. and CDK inhibitors. By the well controlled periodic synthesis and destruction of the cyclins, the corresponding CDK activities go through a corresponding sequential activation and inactivation, which provide the primary means of cell cycle control (1Johnson D.G. Walker C.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar).The cyclins first were identified as the proteins for which levels oscillate during the progression of the eukaryotic cell cycle. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three cyclins (CLN1–CLN3) were found to function in controlling the G1 phase, whereas six closely related B-type cyclins (CLB1–CLB6) were identified in driving the cell cycle from S phase to mitosis (2Küntzel H. Schulz A. Ehbrecht I.M. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 481-487PubMed Google Scholar). These cyclins perform apparently redundant functions because it requires a deletion of all three G1 cyclins to arrest the yeast cells at G1 (3Richardson H.E. Wittenberg C. Cross F. Reed R.I. Cell. 1989; 59: 1127-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and a deletion of CLB2 coupled with a deletion of CLB1, CLB3, or CLB4 for an arrest at G2/M (4Richardson H. Lew D.J. Henze M. Sugimoto K. Reed S.I. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2021-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These cyclins all bind to the same CDK, CDC28, in a sequential manner to activate CDC28 for regulating yeast cell cycle progression (2Küntzel H. Schulz A. Ehbrecht I.M. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 481-487PubMed Google Scholar). Two other cyclins, PCL1 and PCL2 (5Espinoza F.H. Ogas J. Herskowitz I. Morgan D.O. Science. 1994; 266: 1388-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Measday V. Moore L. Ogas J. Tyers M. Andrews B. Science. 1994; 266: 1391-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), associate with another CDK, PHO85, for which the primary function is to transduce the phosphate starvation signal in yeast (7Carroll A.S. O'Shea E.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and also are involved in the yeast G1/S transition. However, cyclin PHO80, which binds to PHO85 in transducing the phosphate starvation pathway, apparently is not involved in cell cycle regulation (7Carroll A.S. O'Shea E.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In mammals, at least 16 cyclin-like proteins have been identified, although only 9 of them were found to associate with different CDKs in cell cycle control (1Johnson D.G. Walker C.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The cyclin proteins are significantly divergent in structure, but they all share a common region known as the cyclin box domain, which binds and activates the CDKs.Trypanosoma brucei is a parasitic protozoan and a causative agent of sleeping sickness in Africa. It also generally is regarded as a deeply branched and relatively primitive eukaryote further removed from mammals than yeast. The trypanosome cell division cycle has the usual sequential G1, S, G2, and M phases, but there is a periodic S phase for the unit mitochondrial genome, the kinetoplast, prior to the nuclear S phase, suggesting a well coordinated replication and segregation between the nucleus and the kinetoplast (8Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, treatment of trypanosome cells with the nuclear DNA synthesis inhibitor aphidicolin or the antimicrotubule agent rhizoxin resulted in blocking nuclear DNA synthesis or mitosis without an inhibitory effect on cytokinesis or kinetoplast segregation (9Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is apparently little connection between the nucleus and the kinetoplast in their propagation, which makes the regulation of the trypanosome cell cycle an interesting subject to pursue.Little is known about how the trypanosome cell cycle is regulated at the molecular level. Two cyclin-like genes, CYC2 and CYC3, were identified recently in T. brucei by rescuing a yeast G1 cyclin deletion mutant (10Van Hellemond J.J. Neuville P. Schwarz R.T. Matthews K.R. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8315-8323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and three cdc2-like protein kinase genes also have been cloned from T. brucei (11Mottram J.C. Smith G. Gene (Amst. 1995; 162: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, their roles in cell cycle control have not been determined. CYC2 is a homologue of PHO80 (10Van Hellemond J.J. Neuville P. Schwarz R.T. Matthews K.R. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8315-8323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Attempts to disrupt the second allele of the CYC2 gene in T. brucei were unsuccessful, which led to the conclusion that the CYC2 gene is essential for T. brucei viability with little additional information available (10Van Hellemond J.J. Neuville P. Schwarz R.T. Matthews K.R. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8315-8323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The trypanosome genome sequence data base, however, has provided us the opportunity to identify potential protein components of the cell cycle regulatory complex, and the recently discovered RNA interference technique has allowed us to knock down individually the expression of these components in T. brucei to assess from the phenotypes of the knock-down cells their potential functions.In the present study, we identified from the T. brucei genome data base five new cyclin-like genes other than CYC2 and CYC3 and cloned the full-length cDNAs of four of them. RNAi experiments on the procyclic form of T. brucei showed that a single PHO80 homologue, CycE1/CYC2, played an essential role in the G1/S transition and that a single B-type cyclin homologue CycB2 was indispensable for passing the G2/M boundary (see below). Two different types of anucleated zoid cells, the slender zoid and the stumpy zoid, each containing a single kinetoplast, were derived from these arrested cells; a slender form was produced from a G1/S block, and a stumpy form resulted from a G2/M inhibition. These findings point to not only a simple and novel mechanism of cell cycle regulation but also the occurrence of cell division driven by kinetoplast segregation and cytokinesis in the absence of either nuclear DNA replication or mitosis in T. brucei.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—The procyclic form of T. brucei strain 29-13 (12Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar) was cultivated at 26 °C in Cunningham's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biological). G418 (15 μg/ml) and hygromycin B (50 μg/ml) were added to the culture medium to maintain the T7 RNA polymerase and tetracycline repressor gene constructs within the cells.Identification of Cyclin-like cDNAs from T. brucei—Partial genomic sequences of the cyclin-like genes were identified from The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) trypanosome genome project sequence data base by the BLAST search program using yeast CLN1–CLN3 and CLB1–CLB6 genes and T. brucei CYC2 and CYC3 genes as the queries. Gene-specific primers then were designed according to the partial sequence information (available upon request) and employed in reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). First-strand cDNAs were generated from the total RNA of T. brucei with an oligo(dT)15 adaptor primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The 5′-RACE was performed using a gene-specific antisense primer in combination with the splice leader sequence (TTAGAACAGTTTCTGTACTATATTG) known as the common 5′-end of all mRNAs in T. brucei (13Campbell D.A. Thornton D.A. Boothroyd J.C. Nature. 1984; 311: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The 3′-RACE was carried out using a gene-specific sense primer in combination with the adaptor primer, which was introduced into cDNA during reverse transcription. The PCR fragments thus synthesized were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) for sequencing. A pair of specific primers was designed to amplify the full-length cDNA, which then was sequenced for complete open reading frame identification.RNA Interference—Partial cDNA fragments (300–500 bp in length) of the putative cyclin genes (sequence available upon request) each were amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers with XhoI and HindIII linkers and were subcloned into the pZJM vector (14Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) by replacing the α-tubulin fragment in it. The resulting RNAi construct was linearized with NotI so that it could be integrated into the rDNA spacer region of the T. brucei chromosome. Transfection of the procyclic form of T. brucei by electroporation was performed essentially according to our previously described procedures (15Li Z. Zou C.-B. Yao Y. Hoyt M.A. McDonough S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42686-42693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The transfectants were selected under 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin and cloned by limiting dilutions. To induce RNAi, the stable transfectants were cultured in the presence of 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline. Cell numbers were counted under a microscope at different time intervals using a hemocytometer.Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from T. brucei cells using the TRIzol reagent (Amersham Biosciences). First-strand cDNAs were generated from DNase I-treated total RNA samples using oligo(dT)15 primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). PCR was performed using first-strand cDNAs and gene-specific primers that are different from the primer pair used in generating the RNAi construct (sequences available upon request). The PCR cycling program is 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s followed by a final elongation time at 72 °C for 5 min.Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—The FACS analysis of propidium iodide-stained trypanosome cells was carried out as previously described (16Li Z. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42686-42693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, T. brucei cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in ethanol for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice again with PBS and suspended in PBS. DNase-free RNase (10 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (20 μg/ml) were added to the suspension and incubated for 30 min at room temperature before FACS analysis. The DNA content of propidium iodide-stained cells was analyzed with a fluorescence-activated cell sorting scan (FACScan) analytical flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Percentages of cells in each phase of the cell cycle (G1, S, and G2/M) were determined by the ModFitLT V3.1 software (BD Biosciences).RESULTSIdentification of Cyclin-like Genes from T. brucei—By searching the trypanosome genome sequence data base using the yeast G1 cyclin genes CLN1–CLN3, yeast B-type cyclin genes CLB1–CLB6, and the two previously identified T. brucei putative cyclin genes CYC2 and CYC3 as queries, five distinct cyclin-like sequences were identified in addition to the existing CYC2 and CYC3. Based on the partial sequences, gene-specific primers were designed and employed in 5′- and 3′-RACE to amplify the 5′- and 3′-sequences, resulting in successful cloning of the full-length cDNA sequences among four of these five cyclin-like genes. CYC2 and three of the five newly found cyclin homologues contain the cyclin box domain homologous to that of yeast PHO80 cyclin. We renamed CYC2 as CycE1 (CycE1/CYC2) in our present study and named the other three new cyclins CycE2, CycE3, and CycE4, respectively. CYC3 and the two other newly identified cyclin homologues bear sequences very similar to those of the B-type cyclins from a variety of other organisms. Thus, we propose to rename CYC3 as CycB1 (CycB1/CYC3) and to name the other two cyclins CycB2 and CycB3.Alignment of the conserved cyclin box domains of the cyclins from trypanosomes and those of other eukaryotes showed that trypanosome CycE1/CYC2, CycE2, CycE3, and CycE4 exhibit significant sequence homology to the PHO80 cyclin of S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1A). CycE1/CYC2 bears a 34% sequence identity with PHO80 in the cyclin box domain. The yeast PHO80 cyclin mainly is involved in the phosphate signaling pathway through its association with another CDK, PHO85, and has no known role in cell cycle control (7Carroll A.S. O'Shea E.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Another yeast cyclin subfamily, the PCL cyclins, is known to associate also with PHO85 (7Carroll A.S. O'Shea E.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and the PCL1-PHO85 and PCL2-PHO85 complexes have been shown to play some roles in controlling the G1/S transition in yeast in addition to the CLN1–CLN3 and CDC28 complexes (5Espinoza F.H. Ogas J. Herskowitz I. Morgan D.O. Science. 1994; 266: 1388-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Measday V. Moore L. Ogas J. Tyers M. Andrews B. Science. 1994; 266: 1391-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the cyclin box domain of trypanosome CycE1–CycE4 exhibits only a very low level of sequence identity with the cyclin box domain of the PCLs (16% between CycE1 and PCL1). Thus it is not possible to determine from the cyclin box domain of trypanosome CycE1–CycE4 whether they function as PHO80 or G1 cyclins.Trypanosome CycB2 showed, surprisingly, significant sequence homology (∼50% identity) to the B-type cyclins from plant species such as Glycine max (cyclin cyc5Gm) (17Kouchi H. Sekine M. Hata S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1143-1155PubMed Google Scholar), Catharanthus roseus (cyclin CYM) (18Ito M. Marie-Claire C. Sakabe M. Ohno T. Hata S. Kouchi H. Hashimoto J. Fukuda H. Komamine A. Watanabe A. Plant J. 1997; 11: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and Antirrhinum majus (cyclin 1) (Fig. 1B) (19Fobert P.R. Coen E.S. Murphy G.J. Doonan J.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) as well as many B-type cyclin homologues from Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (data not shown). CycB2 exhibited a lower (31–39%) sequence identity to the cyclin box domains of yeast B-type cyclins CLB1–CLB6. Trypanosome CycB3 exhibited, however, a very low level of sequence identity with plant B-cyclins but a moderate level of sequence identity (∼25%) and similarity (∼45%) to the B-type cyclins from a variety of other organisms such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe (cyclin CDC13) (20Booher R. Beach D. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2321-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), Drosophila (cyclin CycB) (21Jacobs H.W. Knoblich J.A. Lehner C.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and A. thaliana (cyclin CYC1) (22Hemerly A. Bergounioux C. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Ferreira P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3295-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The three trypanosomal putative B-type cyclins CycB1/CYC3, CycB2, and CycB3 exhibited a low level of sequence homology (∼20% identity) to one another, suggesting that they may have originated from different subfamilies. This is in sharp contrast to CycE1–CycE4, which bear close sequence similarities with one another and could be derived from the same subfamily. Consequently, CycE1–CycE4 could be functionally redundant, whereas the three B-cyclins may perform non-overlapping functions. A functional analysis of each of these seven cyclin homologues by RNAi may shed some light on these uncertainties.RNA Interference of Expression of Individual Cyclin Genes in the Procyclic Form of T. brucei—We employed the RNAi technique to selectively knock down expression of the seven individual cyclin genes in the procyclic form of T. brucei so that we could explore the potential roles that they each may play during the trypanosome cell cycle. A 300–500-bp DNA fragment of a unique sequence from the coding region of each cyclin gene was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the RNAi vector pZJM (14Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The resulting construct then was introduced by electroporation into the procyclic form cells of T. brucei strain 29-13, expressing both tetracycline repressor and T7 RNA polymerase. The stable transfectants were selected under phleomycin and cloned by limiting dilution. Transcription of the DNA insert into double-stranded RNA was induced by adding tetracycline to the culture medium to switch on the T7 promoters. Double-stranded RNA thus synthesized is known to lead to specific degradations of its corresponding mRNA in T. brucei (14Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol.

The results, shown in the insets of Fig. 2, indicate that after initiating RNAi for 2 days, the levels of mRNA encoding individual cyclins decreased significantly and became undetectable by RT-PCR. This effective blockade of gene expression also turned out to be highly specific as the levels of the other six cyclin mRNAs were unaffected in each case (data not shown). Effects of individual cyclin mRNA depletion on trypanosome replication then were monitored by daily counting of the cultured transfected cells with or without tetracycline induction (Fig. 2). The results, presented as time courses of cell growth, indicated that among the four PHO80 homologue-deficient cell lines, only the growth of CycE1/CYC2-deficient cells was inhibited significantly (Fig. 2A). The growth of cells deficient in CycE2 or CycE4 assumes the same rate as the wild type cells, whereas the CycE3-deficient cells grow with an ∼50% reduced rate compared with the wild type. Among the three B-type cyclin-deficient cell lines, a knock-down of CycB2 expression results in a complete arrest of cell growth, whereas loss of CycB1/CYC3 exerts no appreciable effect on the rate of growth (Fig. 2B). Deficiency in CycB3 led to slower cell growth at a rate of about 60% of the wild type.Fig. 2Effects of RNAi of expression of putative cyclin genes on the growth of procyclic form T. brucei cells. Procyclic trypanosome cell lines harboring the RNAi plasmid constructs each were incubated in culture medium with (+Tet) or without (—Tet) 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline at 26 °C, and the rate of cell growth was monitored. The numbers of cells were counted under a microscope and plotted against incubation time (Days). The insets show the mRNA levels, which were detected by semiquantitative RT-PCR in the individual cell lines before (—) and after (+) tetracycline induction for 3 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This observation led to a tentative conclusion that CycE1/CYC2 and CycB2 each performs an essential function in promoting the progression of the cell cycle in the procyclic form of T. brucei. Inclusion of CycE3 and CycB3 accelerates the rate of cell cycle progression considerably, albeit neither protein is indispensable for maintaining the cycle. CycE2, CycE4, and CycB1/CYC3 probably are not involved in controlling the cell cycle. It is unlikely that the lack of effect from knocking down their expression could be attributed to their long protein half-lives because G1 cyclins and B-type cyclins are well known for their short half-lives due to rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome (27Van Hellemond J.J. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28Koeep D.M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1999; 97: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar).Cell Cycle Defects Identified in the Cyclin-deficient Trypanosome Cells—To ascertain the specific point of cell cycle arrest among the individual cyclin-deficient trypanosome cell lines, we stained the cells with propidium iodide and performed FAC-Scan to separate them by their DNA content. The results, which are presented in Fig. 3, show that among the CycE1/CYC2-deficient cells, those in the G1 phase are increased to comprise ∼90% of the total population, whereas the G2/M phase cells are decreased to make up ∼10% of the total population. The S phase cells are essentially undetectable after 9 days of induced RNAi (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that the transition from G1 to S phase is inhibited significantly. CycE1/CYC2 thus could be a bona fide G1 cyclin performing an essential role in promoting the G1/S transition in trypanosomes. When CycE3 is deficient (Fig. 3B), there is only a slight increase (∼10%) in G1 phase cells, accompanied by a corresponding decrease in S phase cells without an appreciable change in the G2/M population over a period of 9 days. This observation suggests that the transition from G1 to S phase is slowed down slightly without arresting the progression of the cell cycle. CycE3 thus still may perform a role, albeit nonessential, in the G1/S transition. Consistent with their lack of effect on cell proliferation, a deficiency of CycE2 or CycE4 in trypanosome cells did not result in any apparent change in the profiles of the cells compared with wild type cells (data not shown). These two proteins probably are not involved in cell cycle regulation. We thus conclude that CycE1/CYC2 is the dominant as well as the essential G1 cyclin, whereas CycE3 plays an auxiliary role in the G1/S transition of T. brucei in procyclic form.Fig. 3FACS analysis of four different cyclin-deficient procyclic form T. brucei cell lines.T. brucei cells harboring different RNAi plasmid constructs were incubated in culture medium in the presence of 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline. Time samples were collected, stained with propidium iodide, and subjected to FACS analysis. Percentages of cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases in three independent RNAi induction experiments were determined by the ModFitLT software and plotted on the right-hand side of each panel. The representative histograms from FACScan are presented on the left-hand side of each panel. A, CycE1/CYC2-deficient cells. B, CycE3-deficient cells. C, CycB2-deficient cells. D, CycB3-deficient cells. 2N, diploid; 4N, tetraploid; d, days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Depletion of CycB2 resulted in the arrest of almost 90% of the cell population in the G2/M phase within a relatively short period of 24 h (Fig. 3C). This suggests that CycB2 is a highly essential mitotic cyclin in the procyclic form of T. brucei, mediating the progression through G2 to M phase. The CycB3-deficient cells showed a slight (∼10%) increase in the number of G2/M phase cells with a corresponding decrease in the number of G1 phase cells after 9 days (Fig. 3D), suggesting an auxiliary role of CycB3 in promoting the cells through the G2/M boundary. Finally, depletion of CycB1/CYC3 had no detectable effect on the profile of cells in FACScan (data not shown), suggesting that CycB1/CYC3 likely is uninvolved in cell cycle control. The results derived from these experiments thus indicate once again only one essential/dominant mitotic cyclin, CycB2, and one auxiliary mitotic cyclin, CycB3, in the procyclic form of T. brucei. This scheme of cyclin-regulated G1/S and G2/M transition is perhaps the simplest among all those known to date.Cellular Morphology of the Cyclin-deficient T. brucei Procyclic Form Cells—Microscopic examination of the CycE1/CyC2-deficient cells indicated an obvious morphological change from the original wild type. A long slender morphology of the cells became obvious after induction of RNAi for 3 days, becoming even longer and more slender after 9 days (Fig. 4A, middle panel). It was apparently the consequence of a blocked G1/S transition. Most of the population (80–90%) contained one nucleus and one kinetoplast (1N1K) in each cell as in the wild type cells. But, unlike the wild type cells, about 7% of the population (Fig. 4B, middle panel), appearing shorter and smaller in size, turned out to contain no nucleus but one kinetoplast in each cell upon staini"
https://openalex.org/W2060420126,"Biosynthesis of disialyl Lewis a (Lea) was analyzed using previously cloned ST6GalNAc V and ST6GalNAc VI, which were responsible for the synthesis of α-series gangliosides. Among lactotetraosylceramide (Lc4), neolactotetraosylceramide, and their sialyl forms, only sialyl Lc4 was sialylated with ST6GalNAc V and ST6GalNAc VI. The products were confirmed to be disialyl Lea in TLC-immunostaining. Compared with the original substrate GM1b, the synthetic rates of disialyl Lea were 22 and 38% with ST6GalNAc V and ST6GalNAc VI, respectively. Since sialyl Lea could not be converted to disialyl Lea, disialyl Lea was produced only from disialyl Lc4. Therefore, it appears that ST6GalNAc V/VI and fucosyltransferase III (FUT-3) compete for sialyl Lc4, their common substrate. The results of either one transfection or co-transfection of two genes into COS1 cells revealed that both ST6GalNAc VI and FUT-3 contributed in the synthesis of disialyl Lea but partly compete with each other. Many colon cancer cell lines expressed the ST6GalNAc VI gene more or less, and some of them actually expressed disialyl Lea. None of them expressed ST6GalNAc V. These results suggested the novel substrate specificity of ST6GalNAc VI, which is responsible for the synthesis of disialyl Lea but not for α-series gangliosides in human colon tissues."

Here we show the functional and physical interaction between components of endoplasmic reticulum translocon and the exocytosis machinery. We show that overexpression of SEB1 suppresses the growth defect in all exocyst sec mutants. In addition, overexpression of SEC61 or SSS1 encoding the other two components of the Sec61p complex suppressed the growth defects of several exocyst mutants. Seb1p was coimmunoprecipitated from yeast cell lysates with Sec15p and Sec8p, components of the exocyst complex, and with Sec4p, a secretory vesicle associated Rab GTPase that binds to Sec15p and is essential for exocytosis. The interaction between Seb1p and Sec15p was abolished in sec15-1 mutant and was restored upon SEB1 overexpression. Furthermore, in wild type cells overexpression of SEB1 as well as SEC4 resulted in increased production of secreted proteins.

Botstein Open table in a new tab Plasmids and DNA Methods—Plasmids YEpHA-SEB1 and pBSEB1 have been described (20Toikkanen J. Gatti E. Takei K. Saloheimo M. Olkkonen V.M. Söderlund H. De Camilli P. Keränen S. Yeast. 1996; 12: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The SEB1 cDNA covering the open reading frame was transferred from pBSEB1 under TPI1 promoter in pYX212 multicopy vector (R&D Systems) as an EcoRI-XhoI fragment yielding plasmid YEpT-SEB1U. YEpSEB2U is pRS426 (29Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar) containing the SEB2 expression cassette as a BamHI-HindIII fragment from YEpSEB2 (20Toikkanen J. Gatti E. Takei K. Saloheimo M. Olkkonen V.M. Söderlund H. De Camilli P. Keränen S. Yeast. 1996; 12: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). YEpSEC1aU overexpressing SEC1 and YEp24H (30Aalto M.K. Ronne H. Keränen S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) as well as YEpSSO1U and YEpSSO2U overexpressing SSO1 and SSO2, respectively, have been described (31Jäntti J. Aalto M.K. Öyen M. Sundqvist L. Keränen S. Ronne H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 409-420PubMed Google Scholar). For disruption of the URA3 gene, pBUF containing a 331-base pair (bp) deletion within the 1135-bp-long URA3 coding region was constructed as follows. Two URA3 fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned into the multiple cloning site of pBluescript SK(-). The first fragment comprising bp 71–450 of the URA3 was cloned as a SacI-XbaI fragment and the second (bp 781-1135) as a XhoI-KpnI fragment. pBW65 containing the SEC61 gene in YEp351 vector (32Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar) and FKp53 (33Esnault Y. Blondel M.-O. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. Képès F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4083-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) containing the SSS1 gene in YEp352 were obtained from Colin Stirling. The control plasmids for pBW65 and FKp53 were pRS425 (29Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar) and YEp24H (30Aalto M.K. Ronne H. Keränen S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), respectively, and for YEpHA-SEB1 was pVT102U (34Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene. 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To generate a His6-tagged Sec4p, the coding region was amplified by PCR with BamHI-XhoI sites added and cloned into a version of pGAT (provided by Johan Peränen) from which the GST coding region was removed by SpeI digestion and religation. This resulted in pGATHis-Sec4p. To generate a His6-tagged version of the first 241 amino acids of Sec15p, the coding region for these amino acids was amplified by PCR and cloned as a BamHI-EcoRI fragment to pRSETA (Invitrogen) to create pSET-His-Sec15 (amino acids 1–241). The fragment encoding Seb1p without transmembrane domain (amino acids 1–54) was created by PCR with oligonucleotide primers containing XbaI and XhoI sites and ligated into XbaI-XhoI cut pVT102U (34Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene. 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) yielding YEpSEB1-MA. The plasmid YIplac204αa for α-amylase gene integration was obtained by inserting the α-amylase expression cassette (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens α-amylase gene between ADH1 promoter and terminator) from YEpαa6 (35Ruohonen L. Aalto M.K. Keränen S. J. Biotechnol. 1995; 39: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) as BamHI-SalI fragment into the multiple cloning site of YIplac204 (36Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). SEC3 in YEp352 (37Haarer B.K. Corbett A. Kweon Y. Petzold A.S. Silver P. Brown S. Genetics. 1996; 144: 495-510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Brian Haarer, YEpSEC4 (NRB524) and pNB148 overexpressing SEC4 (38Salminen A. Novick P. Cell. 1987; 49: 527-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) and SEC15 (39Salminen A. Novick P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), respectively, from Peter Novick, and pRD6 and pDF11 overexpressing SEC62 (40Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2653-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and SEC63 (41Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6024-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), respectively, from Randy Schekman. Standard DNA methods were used for cloning. The yeast cells were transformed as described (20Toikkanen J. Gatti E. Takei K. Saloheimo M. Olkkonen V.M. Söderlund H. De Camilli P. Keränen S. Yeast. 1996; 12: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Multicopy Suppression—The mutant strains were transformed with the multicopy plasmid overexpressing the gene under study or with the pertinent vector control. The multicopy suppression was first screened by replica plating freshly grown patches on selective plates and on YPD and growing them at different temperatures. Growth was monitored for 3 successive days. The suppression test was then done by dotting 105 cells and three 10-fold dilutions thereof on selective plates and incubating the plates at different temperatures for 3 days. The patching method was slightly more sensitive and rescued the growth at a slightly higher temperature or detected in some cases weak suppression that was not detected by dotting. Determination of α-Amylase and Invertase Activity—Yeast cell growth, preparation of the periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions, and determination of the α-amylase activity were done as described previously (42Ruohonen L. Toikkanen J. Tieaho V. Outola M. Söderlund H. Keränen S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Invertase activity was determined as described (42Ruohonen L. Toikkanen J. Tieaho V. Outola M. Söderlund H. Keränen S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) except that the reaction was terminated with addition of 1 m Tris, pH 8.5, after which the cells were pelleted instead of filtering and the glucose liberated from sucrose by invertase was measured from the supernatant. Antibodies and Protein Methods—Antibodies against an N-terminal peptide of Seb1p have been described (20Toikkanen J. Gatti E. Takei K. Saloheimo M. Olkkonen V.M. Söderlund H. De Camilli P. Keränen S. Yeast. 1996; 12: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The antibodies against Sec4p and Sec15p were raised in rabbits injected with bacterially (Escherichia coli BL-21de3) expressed and purified His6-Sec4p and His6-Sec15p (amino acids 1–241). HA (12CA5) and Myc tag antibodies (9E10) were purchased from Roche Applied Science and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. For detection of Sec4p in Western blots, an IgG heavy chain-specific secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) was used to reduce signals from closely migrating IgG light chain specific bands. Other antibodies were generous gifts from Howard Riezman (antibodies against Gas1p) and Romano Serrano (anti-Pma1p antibodies). The proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE using the buffer system of either Laemmli (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) or Schägger and von Jagow (44Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) with acrylamide concentrations from 7.5 to 15% as appropriate for the proteins analyzed and transferred onto Hybond-P filter (Amersham Biosciences). The protein bands were visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Yeast Cell Lysates and Immunoprecipitations—Transformants of strains H2647 and NY15 were grown overnight in SCD-Ura to early logarithmic growth phase of A600 = 1 and pelleted. The cells were washed with 10 mm NaN3 and resuspended in spheroplasting buffer (1.4 m sorbitol, 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 40 mm β-mercapthoethanol) containing 10 mm NaN3. Cells were converted to spheroplasts with 150 μg/ml zymolyase (Seikagaku Corp.). The spheroplasts were cooled on ice, pelleted, washed with spherowash (20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 1.4 m sorbitol), and gently lysed in either homogenization buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl 1 mm EDTA 1% Nonidet P-40) or buffer B (20 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40) by repeated pipetting and 30 min of incubation on ice. Buffer B was utilized to improve the stability of the Sec15-Sec8p complex (45TerBush D.R. Guo W. Dunkelbarger S. Novick P. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Seb1p was coprecipitated with αSec15p antibodies with equal efficiency from cell lysates prepared either in homogenization buffer or buffer B. The cell homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitations. 1.1 mg of total protein of cell lysates in homogenization buffer or buffer B was precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. Precleared lysate containing 1 mg of total protein was subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation with 3 μl of antiserum. Immunoprecipitations were centrifuged (17,000 × g for 1 min); the supernatant was transferred to new tubes, and 20 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose in the same buffer was added. The immunocomplexes were bound to the beads in an end-over-end mixer for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of the lysis buffer and once with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 6.8. The Complete Protease inhibition mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 4 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science) were present during homogenization and preparation of the lysates and immunoprecipitations but were omitted from the washes. The immunocomplexes were released into 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For detection in Western blots, anti-Seb1p was used in 1:2000 to 1:8000 dilutions. Sec8p-Myc was detected with c-Myc-specific antibody (1:500). Anti-Sec4p was used in a 1:80000 dilution and IgG heavy chain-specific antibody in a 1:100000 dilution. Pma1p was detected with anti-Pma1p diluted 1:100000 and Gas1p with anti-Gas1p diluted 1:10000. The bound antibodies in Western blots were visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The quantitations were done from Kodak Biomax MR films using a GS-710 imaging densitometer and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The immunoprecipitates were quantitated by comparing the amount of a given protein precipitated to the amount of that protein in the cell lysate that was used for precipitation. Overexpression of SEB1 Suppresses Temperature-sensitive (ts) Defects of Exocyst Mutants—SEB1 encoding the β subunit of the Sec61p complex was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the temperature sensitive sec15-1 mutation (20Toikkanen J. Gatti E. Takei K. Saloheimo M. Olkkonen V.M. Söderlund H. De Camilli P. Keränen S. Yeast. 1996; 12: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As Sec15p is a component of the exocyst complex, it was of interest to see whether overexpression of SEB1 can suppress temperature-sensitive mutations in the other components of the complex. The exocyst sec mutant strains were transformed with a multicopy plasmid encoding SEB1 or with an empty vector, and their ability to grow at the nonpermissive temperature was tested. Growth of all the exocyst sec mutants was rescued at the restrictive temperature at least partially by SEB1 overexpression (Fig. 1). The growth of sec8-9 and sec15-1 was rescued near or at the level of growth at the permissive temperature, whereas partial rescue was obtained for the rest of the mutants. Possible suppression of the secretion defect of sec8-9 and sec15-1 cells at the restrictive temperature by SEB1 overexpression was also tested. Overexpression of SEB1 ameliorated defective secretion of invertase by these mutants but did not fully restore it to the level of wild type cells (data not shown). We also studied possible synthetic interactions between seb1Δ or seb1Δ seb2Δ and the exocyst mutants (sec3-101, sec5-24, sec6-4, sec8-9, sec10-2, and sec15-1). Deletion of either SEB1 or its close homologue SEB2 does not create a phenotype, but simultaneous deletion of both genes results in temperature sensitivity at 38 °C (20Toikkanen J. Gatti E. Takei K. Saloheimo M. Olkkonen V.M. Söderlund H. De Camilli P. Keränen S. Yeast. 1996; 12: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Finke K. Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). All of the exocyst mutants were crossed with seb1Δ or with seb1Δ seb2Δ strains followed by tetrad analysis. No interactions were observed between seb1Δ and exocyst mutants. The triple mutants seb1Δ seb2Δ sec10-2 and seb1Δ seb2Δ sec15-1 derived from crosses of the double deletant seb1Δ seb2Δ together with sec10-2 or with sec15-1 mutation were 1-2 °C more temperature-sensitive than the seb1Δ seb2Δ double mutant or the single mutants sec10-2 and sec15-1 (data not shown). The suppression data and the synthetic interactions demonstrate multiple genetic interactions between the Sec61β and the exocyst complex. Exocytosis Mutations Are Suppressed by Overexpression of the Sec61p Complex Components but Not Vice Versa—As multiple genetic interactions were observed for SEB1 and the exocytosis machinery, we studied whether overexpression of the other ER translocation components could suppress mutations in the late-acting SEC genes. The exocyst mutant strains were transformed with plasmids harboring SEC61, SSS1, SEC62, SEC63, or SEB2 or with their vector controls, and the growth of the transformants was tested at different temperatures. SEC61 rescued the growth of sec3-2 efficiently and the growth of sec5-24 and sec6-4 partially (Fig. 2A). Overexpression of SSS1 rescued the growth of sec8-9 and sec15-1 efficiently and growth of sec3-2 and sec5-24 partially (Fig. 2B). In contrast, overexpression of SEC62, SEC63, or SEB2 did not suppress the ts defects in any of the exocytosis mutants tested (data not shown). Suppression of the other late-acting secretory mutants (sec1-1, sec2-41, sec4-8, sec9-4, and sso2-1), mutants of the general components (sec17-1, sec18-1, and sec19-1), as well as mutants of SEC1 homologues (sly1-1 and slp1Δ) were also analyzed in this screen. Weak suppression by SEB1 overexpression was observed in sec2-41 and in sec19-1 mutants (data not shown). No interactions were detected with any of the other genes studied. The effect of SEB1 overexpression in kar2-133, kar2-159, and sec13-1 mutants was also tested, but their growth at the restrictive temperature was not rescued. Thus, the genetic interactions observed were most prominent between the genes encoding components of the two multiprotein complexes, the Sec61p translocation complex and the exocyst. To test whether the observed genetic interactions function also in the opposite direction, the possible suppression of defects in the ER translocation components by overexpression of genes encoding components of the exocytosis machinery was studied. The sec61-1 and sec61-2 mutants are temperature-sensitive at 37 °C (46Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 47Stirling C.J. Rothblatt J. Hosobuchi M. Deshaies R. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and the sec61-32 and sec61-41 mutants are cold-sensitive at 17 °C (48Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Their growth at these temperatures was not rescued by overexpression of SEC1, SEC3, SEC15, SSO1, or SSO2 gene (data not"

Treatment of cells with the cAMP-elevating agent prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) augmented the level of Cbp/PAG phosphorylation with a concomitant increase in amounts of Csk bound to Cbp/PAG. While TCR-triggering resulted in transient dissociation of Csk from Cbp/PAG/rafts allowing TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation to occur, pretreatment with PGE2 reduced Csk dissociation upon TCR triggering. This correlated with lowered TCR-induced phosphorylation of CD3 ζ-chain and linker for activation of T cells. Moreover, competition of endogenous Csk from lipid rafts abolished PGE2-mediated inhibition of TCR-induced ζ-chain phosphorylation and activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activator protein 1 (AP-1). Finally, raft-associated Csk already activated via Cbp/PAG binding, gained additional increase in phosphotransferase activity upon protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of Csk. We propose that cAMP regulates Csk via both spatial and enzymatic mechanisms, thereby inhibiting signaling through the TCR.

Palmer E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The physiologically relevant pool of Lck most probably partitions into lipid rafts (2Hermiston M.L. Xu Z. Majeti R. Weiss A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In resting T cells this pool of Lck is kept in an inactive state due to phosphorylation of Tyr505 by Csk, which is recruited to rafts via binding of its SH2 domain to phosphorylated Tyr317 in the transmembrane adaptor molecule Cbp/PAG (2Hermiston M.L.

Upon TCR triggering, Csk transiently dissociates from rafts, allowing Lck to become activated (4Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I.

Thus, tonic repression of Lck activity in rafts by Csk seems to set the threshold for TCR signaling and appears necessary to avoid unregulated TCR signaling and activation. This model is supported by several observations: (i) modest overexpression (2.5–3.2-fold) or membrane targeting of Csk inhibit TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and IL-2 production (6Chow L.M. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), (ii) studies on inducible cskknock-outs revealed up-regulated Lck/Fyn activities (7Schmedt C. Saijo K. Niidome T. Kuhn R. Aizawa S. Tarakhovsky A. Nature. 1998; 394: 901-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), (iii) displacement of endogenous Csk from lipid rafts has stimulatory effects on ζ-chain phosphorylation and IL-2 promoter activation both in resting T cells and after TCR triggering (5Torgersen K.M.

Thus, control of Csk activity in rafts seems to be of major importance to prevent aberrant TCR signaling. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) inhibits TCR-induced T cell activation and thereby exerts important immunoregulatory functions (8Kammer G.M. Immunol. Today. 1988; 9: 222-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Based on studies with selective agonists, activation of protein kinase A (PKA) type I is necessary and sufficient for mediating these effects of cAMP (9Skålhegg B.S. Landmark B.F. Døskeland S.O. Hansson V. Lea T. Jahnsen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15707-15714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently found that PKA through phosphorylation of Ser364in Csk induces a 2–4-fold activation of Csk in T cell lipid rafts (10Vang T. Torgersen K.M. Sundvold V. Saxena M. Levy F.O. Skålhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), making Csk the most upstream PKA target reported so far (reviewed in Ref. 11Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Taskén K. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, the question of how PKA can regulate Csk if the latter dissociates from rafts upon TCR triggering remained to be addressed. Here, we report that prostaglandin E2(PGE2) and cAMP induce increased targeting of Csk to rafts, where Csk is further activated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation. This dual effect on Csk localization and activity by cAMP inhibits signaling through the TCR. Human peripheral blood T cells were purified by negative selection as described previously (12Aandahl E.M. Aukrust P. Skålhegg B.S. Muller F. Frøland S.S. Hansson V. Taskén K. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), transfected in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions by using the Amaxa nucleofector and kit (catalog number VPA-1002); transfection efficiencies of more than 80% were achieved. Jurkat TAg cells were transfected as described previously (5Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Horejsi V. Schraven B. Rolstad B. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Biol.

PGE2 and protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (catalog number P-6062) were purchased from Sigma,n-octyl-β-d-glucoside from United States Biochemical, and forskolin from Calbiochem. Phospho- and dephospho-Tyr317-PAG peptides (from Eurogentec) are 10-mer peptides corresponding to the sequence surrounding Tyr317in Cbp/PAG and have been described earlier (13Takeuchi S. Takayama Y.

Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Horejsi V. Schraven B. Rolstad B. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Biol.

A standard cAMP assay (kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, catalog number SP004) was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The program Scion Image from Scion Corp. was used for densitometric scanning analysis. The different Csk constructs have been described elsewhere (5Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Horejsi V. Schraven B. Rolstad B. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29313-29318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). An N-terminally HA-tagged chimeric LAT36-protein kinase A inhibitor (PKI) construct in pEF-HA-Bos vector consisted of the 36 N-terminal amino acids of human LAT (this includes the extracellular and transmembrane domains and the membrane proximal part of the intracellular portion including cysteine residues important for lipid raft localization) fused to PKI. Another LAT-PKI chimer consisted of the N-terminal 39 amino acids of rat LAT fused to PKI (called LAT39-PKI), where the tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic region of LAT had been mutated to phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). T cells were stimulated or not with PGE2 (100 μm for 1.5 min if not stated otherwise); thereafter, anti-CD3 ε monoclonal antibody OKT-3 (5 μg/ml) was added and 2 min later CD3 was cross-ligated by addition of F(ab′)2 fragments (20 μg/ml), and incubations were continued. Cells were disrupted in lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100 with 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride) containingn-octyl-β-d-glucoside (50 mm) and subjected to immunoprecipitation, as described previously (10Vang T. Torgersen K.M. Sundvold V. Saxena M. Levy F.O. Skålhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Lipid raft fractions were isolated as before from cell lysates (with 1% Triton X-100) by sucrose-gradient centrifugation (5Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Horejsi V. Schraven B. Rolstad B. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29313-29318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP (1 mm) and MgCl2 (15 mm) lipid raft fractions were stimulated with or without forskolin (100 μm, 10 min) or PGE2 (100 μm, 2 min) at 30 °C; thereafter, reactions were stopped by addition of lysis buffer containing n-octyl-β-d-glucoside, and subsequently Csk immunoprecipitation and Csk kinase assay with poly(Glu,Tyr) as substrate were performed as described previously (10Vang T.

Equal amounts of immunoprecipitated Csk or co-immunoprecipitated Cbp/PAG present in each kinase reaction were verified by immunoblotting. Cloning, expression, and purification of human Csk, Csk-S364C, and PKA Cα have been reported previously (10Vang T. Torgersen K.M. Sundvold V. Saxena M. Levy F.O. Skålhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These assays were conducted as described previously (5Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Horejsi V.

Muller F. Frøland S.S. Hansson V. Taskén K. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). PGE2 (2 μm) elicited a rapid and robust cAMP response in T cells (Fig.1A), whereas maximal cAMP responses were observed at 15–50-fold higher concentrations of PGE2 (30–100 μm) (data not shown). Interestingly, the total amount of Csk present in lipid rafts of resting T cells increased upon PGE2 stimulation (densitometric scanning analysis: 2.7-fold increase ± 0.5, average ± S.E., n = 3), whereas neither the level of raft-associated Cbp/PAG nor the total amount of Csk present in whole cell lysates were changed (Fig. 1B). In T cells Cbp/PAG is exclusively present in lipid rafts (data not shown), and immunodepletion of Cbp/PAG from isolated rafts removed the majority of raft-associated Csk (Fig. 1C), indicating that Cbp/PAG is the main protein recruiting Csk to rafts in T cells. PGE2stimulation of resting T cells resulted in an increase in Cbp/PAG tyrosine phosphorylation status, and more importantly, a concomitant increase (densitometric scanning analysis: 2.2-fold ± 0.3, average ± S.E., n = 7) in the amounts of Csk that co-immunoprecipitated with Cbp/PAG (Figs. 1D and2B). Similar findings were also obtained with forskolin (not shown). Altogether, this points toward a role for cAMP in modulating the total amount of Csk in lipid rafts of resting T cells.Figure 2PGE2-mediated regulation of raft-associated Csk represses TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation.A, normal T cells were incubated with or without PGE2 for 1.5 min, then OKT-3 was added and samples at time 0 withdrawn and disrupted in lysis buffer containingn-octyl-β-d-glucoside. 2 min later F(ab′)2 fragments were added to allow TCR cross-linking, and samples withdrawn at the indicated periods of time (called anti-CD3). Lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.B, data from four experiments as in A were analyzed with respect to total phosphotyrosine content in CD3 ζ (p21 and p23) and LAT and normalized for the amount of p16 (CD3 ζ). The inhibition in TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation caused by PGE2pretreatment is given. C, same as described in the legend for A, but after disruption of cells, Cbp/PAG immunoprecipitates were analyzed with the indicated antibodies.D, primary T cells were transfected with either empty vector or a plasmid encoding kinase-deficient HA-tagged Csk-SH3-SH2, and the following day an experiment as described in the legend for Awas conducted. The numbers on top of the 4G10 blots are results from densitometric scanning analysis (ratio between total ζ-chain phosphorylation and p16 of ζ; values are relative to the ratio for unstimulated cells). The two 4G10 blots are derived from different gels and should therefore only be compared qualitatively. Expression of the HA-tagged Csk construct is also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next tested whether elevated amounts of Csk in rafts induced by cAMP could repress signaling through the TCR. Incubation of T cells with PGE2 prior to TCR triggering inhibited TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ζ-chain (Fig.2, A and B), LAT (Fig. 2B), and Slp-76 (not shown). While TCR triggering resulted in transient dephosphorylation of Cbp/PAG and dissociation of Csk from Cbp/PAG (and thereby rafts), preincubation of PGE2prior to TCR stimulation increased the amount of Csk co-immunoprecipitating with Cbp/PAG both in the resting state and the first minutes after TCR-triggering (Fig. 2C). We next transfected primary T cells with either empty vector or a plasmid encoding kinase-deficient Csk-SH3-SH2, which has intact and functional SH3 and SH2 domains but lacks the kinase domain. Overexpression of this latter construct has previously been shown to displace endogenous Csk from lipid rafts (5Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Horejsi V. Schraven B. Rolstad B. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29313-29318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). While T cells transfected with empty vector revealed normal TCR-induced ζ-chain phosphorylation (and tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT and Slp-76, not shown) that was inhibited by PGE2 preincubation, transfection of kinase-deficient Csk-SH3-SH2 abolished the inhibitory effects of PGE2 (Fig.2D). Similar findings were obtained with Jurkat TAg cells (not shown). Altogether, this indicates that the inhibitory effects of PGE2/cAMP on TCR signaling are dependent on the presence of Csk in rafts and/or the ability of recruiting additional amounts of Csk to rafts. Previous findings have demonstrated that engagement of the Csk SH2 domain by binding to phosphorylated Cbp/PAG leads to a 2–4-fold increase in Csk kinase activity (13Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29183-29186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A similar induction of Csk activity is caused by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Csk in rafts (10Vang T. Torgersen K.M. Sundvold V. Saxena M. Levy F.O. Skålhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Since cAMP elevates the total amount of raft-associated Csk via increased interaction between Csk and Cbp/PAG, we next tested the impact of the concerted action of Cbp/PAG-binding and PKA-mediated phosphorylation on Csk kinase activity. As reported earlier (13Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29183-29186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), co-incubation of purified Csk with a 10-mer peptide corresponding to phosphorylated Tyr317 in Cbp/PAG (called Tyr(P)317peptide) resulted in an ∼3-fold induction of Csk kinase activity compared with the effect of a corresponding de-phospho peptide (called Tyr317 peptide) (Fig.3A). As expected, co-incubation of the Tyr317 peptide with Csk and PKA catalytic subunit (Cα) resulted in a Csk kinase activity that was 4-fold higher than when PKI was added to the reaction mixture (Fig.3B). Interestingly, co-incubation of Cα with Csk, which is activated through engagement of its SH2 domain with Tyr(P)317 peptide, revealed an additional increase in Csk activity compared with a similar reaction mixture where PKI was also present (Fig. 3B). In addition, Csk-S364C, which is mutated in the PKA phosphorylation site, could no longer be activated by PKA but was still activated through engagement of its SH2 domain with Tyr(P)317 peptide (Fig. 3B). Altogether this indicates that with recombinant proteins in vitro, activation of Csk by engagement of the Csk SH2 domain and by PKA-mediated phosphorylation together induces a higher level of activation of Csk (6-fold) than each mechanism contributes separately. We next tested whether raft-associated Csk, which is bound to phosphorylated Cbp/PAG, could gain additional increase in kinase activity by PKA-mediated phosphorylation. We have previously shown that PKA C and RI subunits are present in lipid rafts from T cells (10Vang T. Torgersen K.M. Sundvold V. Saxena M. Levy F.O. Skålhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both forskolin (Fig. 3C) and PGE2(not shown) induced cAMP production when purified lipid rafts from Jurkat T cells were reconstituted with Mg-ATP. This means that all components necessary for ligand-induced, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Csk are present in rafts. When purified lipid rafts from resting T cells were reconstituted with Mg-ATP, stimulation with either PGE2 or forskolin increased the activity of immunoprecipitated Csk compared with control (Fig. 3D). Since the amounts of co-immunoprecipitated Cbp/PAG were equal in all the Csk immunoprecipitations assessed (Fig. 3D), the observed differences in Csk kinase activity were most probably due to PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Csk induced by the cAMP-elevating agents. Altogether, this indicates that Csk already activated via binding to Cbp/PAG in rafts can achieve an additional increase in kinase activity upon PKA-mediated phosphorylation. This also means that the specific phosphotransferase activity of PKA-phosphorylated, Cbp/PAG-bound Csk is 6–8-fold higher than that of cytosolic, unphosphorylated Csk. Multiple molecular targets for cAMP/PKA have been defined in the signaling cascades downstream of the TCR (reviewed in Ref. 11Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Taskén K. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To test the physiological relevance of raft-associated Csk as a PKA target, we studied downstream signaling events in T cells. As expected, PGE2 inhibited TCR-induced T cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, while the additional presence of the cAMP-antagonist Rp-8-bromo-cAMP right-shifted the curve (Fig. 4A), implicating that the observed effects of PGE2 are mediated by cAMP. We next performed transfection studies with plasmids encoding either kinase-deficient Csk-SH3-SH2 (or Csk-SH3-SH2-W47A, which also has a defect SH3 domain) or LAT-PKI chimeras consisting of the N-terminal part of LAT (including the lipid raft targeting domain) fused to PKI. The Csk mutants have the ability to displace endogenous Csk from lipid rafts, while the LAT-PKI chimeras showed membrane localization in immunofluoresence studies (not shown), distributed mainly to the particulate fraction (Fig. 4B, upper panel) and also partitioned into lipid raft fractions (Fig. 4B,lower panel). Thus, the LAT-PKI chimeras potentially could inhibit membrane-bound PKA activity. PGE2 pretreatment inhibited TCR-induced NFAT-AP-1 activation in Jurkat TAg cells ∼40% (Fig. 4C), while expression of kinase-deficient Csk-SH3-SH2 or the different LAT-PKI chimeras abolished these inhibitory effects of PGE2 (Fig. 4C). Forskolin induced a stronger and more sustained cAMP response compared with PGE2 (not shown) and yielded up to 65% inhibition of TCR-induced NFAT-AP-1 activation when control transfected cells were pretreated with forskolin (Fig.4D). In contrast, cells transfected with either kinase-deficient Csk or LAT-PKI were almost insensitive to the inhibitory effects of forskolin (20 and 17% inhibition, respectively, Fig. 4D). Altogether, this indicates that both raft-associated Csk and membrane-bound PKA are essential for the inhibitory effects of PGE2/cAMP on TCR-induced downstream signaling events such as NFAT-AP-1 activation. The effects of cAMP/PKA on raft-associated Csk described in this paper, including both spatial and enzymatic regulation of Csk, result in repression of signaling through the TCR, and hence T cell activation. However, how cAMP induces increased phosphotyrosine levels in Cbp/PAG, and thereby facilitates Csk binding, is still an enigma and suggests the involvement of additional targets regulated by cAMP. This can encompass both protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Src family kinases are reported to phosphorylate Cbp/PAG (3Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagai K. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 4Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A.

Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), but at least in T cells the activity of Lck is lowered upon cAMP-stimulation, most probably due to activation of Csk (10Vang T. Torgersen K.M. Sundvold V. Saxena M. Levy F.O. Skålhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a recent report points toward an essential role for Fyn in the phosphorylation of Cbp/PAG in T cells (14Yasuda K. Nagafuku M. Shima T. Okada M. Yagi T. Yamada T. Minaki Y. Kato A. Tani-Ichi S. Hamaoka T. Kosugi A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2813-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In vitrostudies have revealed that Csk also can phosphorylate Cbp/PAG, but only when Cbp/PAG has a certain phosphotyrosine content beforehand (13Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29183-29186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The protein-tyrosine phosphatases responsible for regulation of Cbp/PAG phosphorylation status are currently being unraveled, and a recent report implicated CD45 in dephosphorylation of Cbp/PAG upon TCR triggering (15Davidson D. Bakinowski M. Thomas M.L. Horejsi V. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2017-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, further studies appear necessary to identify the targets whereby cAMP regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbp/PAG. In conclusion, we report that the cAMP/PKA signal pathway through dual mechanisms of increased anchoring and direct phosphorylation-dependent activation regulates Csk, thereby inhibiting signaling through the TCR. This involves cAMP-driven recruitment of Csk to rafts where PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Csk results in elevated levels of raft-associated Csk phosphotransferase activity.

Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, is a noncultivable sexually transmitted human pathogen that disseminates from a site of inoculation, usually within the genital area, to diverse organs where it can establish persistent, even lifelong, infection (1Tramont E.C.

The lack of techniques for in vitro cultivation and genetic manipulation of T. pallidum has greatly hindered investigation of treponemal physiology, including metal metabolism.

Microbiol. 2001; 152: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition to encoding an ATPase (TroB), two cytoplasmic membrane permeases (TroC and TroD), and a DtxR-like metalloregulator (TroR), the operon also encodes the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglyceromutase (Gpm) (13Hardham J.M. Stamm L.V. Porcella S.F. Frye J.G. Barnes N.Y. Howell J.K. Mueller S.L. Radolf J.D. Weinstock G.M. Norris S.J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 197: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because the T. pallidum Gpm has no requirement for metals (16Benoit S. Posey J.E. Chenoweth M.R. Gherardini F.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4702-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the physiological benefit of transcriptionally linking the spirochete's sole copy of this essential enzyme to the Tro transporter genes is unclear. The identity of the metal ligand(s) for the Tro transporter is a subject of controversy (5Claverys J.-P. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Hantke K. Biometals. 2001; 14: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our analysis of TroA purified from Escherichia coli showed that Zn2+ was present in a 1:1 molar ratio, whereas other metals were present in trace or undetectable quantities (17Deka R.K. Lee Y.H. Hagman K.E. Shevchenko D. Lingwood C.A. Hasemann C.A. Norgard M.V. Radolf J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4420-4423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the assumption that the SBP determines specificity of the transporter (18Tam R. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Higgins C.F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), we proposed that the permease mediates Zn2+ influx (15Lee Y.H. Deka R.K. Norgard M.V. Radolf J.D. Hasemann C.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Posey et al. (20Posey J.E. Hardham J.M. Norris S.J. Gherardini F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10887-10892Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), using recombinant TroR for mobility shift DNA binding and DNase I footprint assays, reported that only Mn2+ could promote the binding of TroR to the tro promoter, leading them and others to conclude that the permease transports Mn2+ (5Claverys J.-P.

Michalek S.M. Macrina F.L. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4441-4451Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Conclusions from both studies are, however, essentially extrapolations from in vitro data. There are precedents for metalloproteins binding Zn2+ rather than their primary substrate when heterologously expressed in E. coli (25Eidsness M.K. O'Dell S.E. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Robson R.L. Scott R.A. Protein. Eng. 1992; 5: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Petillot Y. Forest E. Mathieu I. Meyer J. Moulis J.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similarly, in vitro and in vivo studies of metalloregulators have not always yielded identical profiles of metal-dependent DNA binding (3Ratledge C. Dover L.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 881-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar, 27Gaballa A. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5815-5821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Patzer S.I. Hantke K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24321-24332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We therefore devised an experimental strategy that would permit a more direct assessment of Tro permease function and regulation. Here we examined (i) metal binding by apo-TroA; (ii) the functional capacity of the transporter when expressed in surrogate hosts; (iii) the metal specificity of TroR-mediated transporter repression in E. coli; and (iv) the effect of TroR-mediated repression on Gpm expression. Our findings indicate that the permease transports Zn2+, Mn2+, and possibly iron but that Zn2+ is likely to be the primary activator of TroR under physiological conditions. We also found that expression of Gpm was not tightly linked to transcription of the tro transporter genes. This revised understanding of metal uptake and regulation by the Tro permease provides a foundation for further analysis of its role in treponemal metal metabolism and, by extension, syphilis pathogenesis. Primers and Plasmids—Descriptions of the primers and plasmids used in this work are presented in the supplemental table, which is available online at the JBC web site (www.jbc.org). Bacterial Strains and Media—Animal protocols described in this work were approved by the University of Connecticut Health Center Animal Care Committee under the auspices of Animal Welfare Assurance A3471-01. T. pallidum subspecies pallidum (Nichols-Farmington strain) was propagated by intratesticular inoculation of adult New Zealand White rabbits and harvested as described previously (29Hazlett K.R.O. Sellati T.J. Nguyen T.T. Cox D.L. Clawson M.L. Caimano M.J. Radolf J.D. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, E. coli strain TOP10F′ (Invitrogen) was the recipient strain for recombinant constructs and was grown in LB medium with appropriate antibiotic supplementation. For experiments requiring media with reduced metal contents, either M9 medium (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) or a specially formulated minimal medium (Hazlett-Radolf minimal medium (HRMM)) was utilized for the growth of E. coli. M9 medium contains 1× M9 salts, 0.2% casamino acids, and 0.4% glucose. HRMM contains 0.4% glucose, 0.2% casamino acids, 0.2% ATP, 0.2% ammonium sulfate, 1 mm magnesium sulfate, 9 μm FeSO4, and 1.67% PIPES, pH 6.5. Yersinia pestis strains were grown in the defined medium PMH2 (30Gong S. Bearden S.W. Geoffroy V.A. Fetherston J.D. Perry R.D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2829-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Generation of TroA apo Proteins and Determination of Dissociation Constants—The plasmid (pHTa:TroA), which encodes an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible polyhistidine-tagged TroA protein has been described previously (17Deka R.K. Lee Y.H. Hagman K.E. Shevchenko D. Lingwood C.A. Hasemann C.A. Norgard M.V. Radolf J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4420-4423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid also served as the template for site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with primers TroA H199E 5′ and TroA H199E 3′, which changed the H codon (CAT) of residue 199 to a E codon (GAA), generating pHTa:TroA(H199E). Sequence analysis confirmed that only the desired mutation had been introduced. Expression and purification of His-TroA and His-TroA(H199E) were performed as previously described (17Deka R.K. Lee Y.H. Hagman K.E. Shevchenko D. Lingwood C.A. Hasemann C.A. Norgard M.V. Radolf J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4420-4423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). His tags were removed by digestion with TEV protease (Invitrogen) followed by a second round of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography, which captures free His tag, uncleaved fusion protein, and the His-tagged TEV protease. To generate apo-proteins suitable for metal binding studies, endogenously bound metals were removed from the purified proteins by overnight dialysis against 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.6) containing 10 mm 1,10 o-phenanthroline (Sigma) (31Lee Y.H. Dorwart M.R. Hazlett K.R.O. Deka R.K. Norgard M.V. Radolf J.D. Hasemann C.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2300-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Restoration of metal binding capacity was achieved by sequential dialysis against 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.6) and 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 6.5), respectively. The apo-proteins were adjusted to between 25 and 35 μm and aliquoted as 1.1-ml portions into 8000 molecular weight cut-off dialysis bags (SPECTRA/POR, Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc, Los Angeles, CA). Thereafter, all protein manipulations employed acid-washed plastic containers and buffers treated with Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad). The dialysis bags containing apo-protein were transferred to 50-ml conical tubes containing 45 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 6.5) with Mn2+ or Zn2+ acetate (0–100 μm) and dialyzed overnight. Protein and dialysate samples were analyzed for Zn2+ by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy or for Mn2+ by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN). The protein concentrations were confirmed by amino acid analysis. Metal-toproteins ratios (θ) were plotted against the free metal (Me2+) concentrations (μm) and fitted to sigmoidal curves using the equation θ = ((N[Me2+])/(Kd + [Me2+])) + 0.3, where N (Me2+-binding sites) = 1 (17Deka R.K. Lee Y.H. Hagman K.E. Shevchenko D. Lingwood C.A. Hasemann C.A. Norgard M.V. Radolf J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4420-4423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The correction factor of 0.3 was included to better fit the sigmoidal curves to the data; Kd values obtained without this correction did not differ significantly from those presented in this work. Y. pestis znu and mntH Mutants and Complementation Plasmids—To generate the Y. pestis znu knockout plasmid pSucZnu3.5, we recovered the wild type znu locus from a Sau3AI genomic library (32Pendrak M.L. Perry R.D. Biol. Met. 1991; 4: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using a znuA probe and subcloned a 9.4-kb BglII/Asp718 fragment into pWSK129, generating pZnu2, which served both as a complementation plasmid as well as an intermediate in the construction of pSucZnu3.5. pZnu2 was digested with EcoRI and ApaI, treated with Klenow, and self-ligated, generating pZnu3, which harbors the znu locus with a 1265-bp deletion covering approximately half of znuB, all of znuC, and the bi-directional znuCB/znuA promoter. The 7.5-kb Δznu XbaI fragment from pZnu3 was ligated into the suicide vector pSuc1 (33Fetherston J.D. Bertolino V.J. Perry R.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), generating pSucZnu3.5, which was electroporated into Y. pestis KIM6+ (34Bearden S.W. Perry R.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Clones arising from double cross-over events were selected by successively screening for ampicillin and sucrose resistance. A Δ znu isolate (KIM6–2077+) whose genotype was confirmed by Southern blot was used in this work. To generate a mntH knockout plasmid, the 5′ and 3′ regions of the mntH gene were PCR-amplified from Y. pestis DNA using primer pairs YpMntH5′-SalI/YpMntH5′-SmaIR and YpMntH3′-SmaIF/YpMntH3′-SpeI, digested with SalI/SmaI and SmaI/SpeI, respectively, and cloned in tandem into SalI/SpeI-digested suicide vector pKNG101 (35Sarker M.R. Cornelis G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 410-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), creating pΔMntH. The resulting insert consists of the mntH gene, lacking 600 bp of coding sequence, flanked by 300 and 80 bp at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Plasmid pΔMntH was used to transform Y. pestis KIM6 and the isogenic yfe mutant Y. pestis KIM6–2031.1 (34Bearden S.W. Perry R.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Clones arising from double cross-over events were selected by successively screening for streptomycin and sucrose resistance. Plasmid pMntH-Op was generated by PCR amplifying the mntH gene with its native promoter from Y. pestis KIM6 DNA using primer pair YpMntH5′-SalI/YpMntH3′-XbaI; the resulting fragment was cloned into pWSK129 (36Wang R.F. Kushner S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) in the opposite orientation of the vector-encoded lacZ gene. Construction of Permease Plasmids—The promoter-less troABCD genes were PCR-amplified from T. pallidum chromosomal DNA using the proofreading polymerase Ex-Taq (Panvera, Madison, WI), primers NoPro TroA 5′ EcoRI and TroD 3′ EcoRI and cloned into TOPO pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Following sequence confirmation, the insert was moved into the EcoRI site of pBAD18 (37Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar), and a plasmid harboring the treponemal genes in the same orientation as the pBAD promoter (pTroA-D) was identified. pTroA(H199E)-D was generated from pTroA-D as described above and confirmed by sequence analysis. The primer pairs used to PCR amplify mntH, yfeABCD, scaCBA, and adcCBA from E. coli K-12, Y. pestis KIM6, S. gordonii DL1, and Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR 4 genomic DNAs, respectively, for cloning into pBAD18, are presented in the supplemental table, as are the resulting plasmids. The divergently transcribed znu genes of E. coli K12 were amplified using primers Ec ZnuA 3′ KpnI and Ec ZnuB 3′ XbaI, digested, and directly cloned into KpnI/XbaI-digested pWSK129, generating pEcZnu. To clone the complete tro operon, a DNA fragment extending from 106 bp upstream of the troA start codon to the gpm stop codon was PCR-amplified from T. pallidum DNA using Ex-Taq polymerase (Panvera) and primers TroPro 5′ EcoRI and Gpm 3′ SacII. The amplicon was digested with EcoRI and SacII and cloned into the EcoRI/SacII sites of plasmids pWSK129 and pWSK29 (36Wang R.F. Kushner S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) such that the tro operon was oriented oppositely to that of the vector-encoded lacZ promoter, creating pPro-Gpm and pPro-Gpm Amp, respectively. Transformants were plated on M9 agar containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin (pPro-Gpm) or 100 μg/ml ampicillin (pPro-GpmAmp), 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 20 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and grown overnight at 30 °C. The cloned insert was sequenced using primers listed in the supplemental materials. A variant, pNoPro-Gpm, which lacks the tro promoter, was similarly generated using primers NoPro TroA 5′ EcoRI and Gpm 3′ SacII. Complementation of Y. pestis and E. coli Transporter Mutants— Complementation analysis of Y. pestis strains was conducted in PMH2 broth (30Gong S. Bearden S.W. Geoffroy V.A. Fetherston J.D. Perry R.D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2829-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and chelator gradient plates as described previously (34Bearden S.W. Perry R.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar); all manipulations were conducted in acid-washed glassware. For experiments with broth, Y. pestis strains cultivated on tryptose blood agar slants were suspended in PMH2 medium to an A620 of 0.1 and grown overnight. The following morning they were diluted to an A620 of 0.1 in fresh PMH2 containing the required antibiotics with or without 0.2% arabinose. Growth at 30 °C in a shaking water bath was spectrophotometrically monitored. Arabinose-containing chelator gradient plates containing 0–1 μm TPEN or 0–5 μm conalbumin were inoculated and incubated for 3 days at 30 °C, after which growth into the metaldepleted zones was measured. Complementation analysis of a Zn2+ uptake-deficient E. coli strain was conducted in HRMM broth. Overnight HRMM cultures of E. coli GR354 (Δznu/ΔzupT) (38Grass G. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. Smith R.L. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 864-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) bearing either control or transporter plasmids were diluted into fresh medium containing appropriate antibiotics, 0 or 0.2% arabinose, and various concentrations of either the Zn2+ chelator TPEN or ZnCl2. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C with vigorous aeration, and growth was spectrophotometrically monitored for 12 h. 65Zn and 54Mn Transport Assays—With minor variation, transport assays were conducted as previously described (39Kehres D.G. Janakiraman A. Slauch J.M. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3159-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 40Kehres D.G. Zaharik M.L. Finlay B.B. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1085-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). E. coli strain MM2115 (ΔmntH) (40Kehres D.G. Zaharik M.L. Finlay B.B. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1085-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and E. coli strain GR362, which lacks all known Zn2+ uptake and efflux transporters (38Grass G. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. Smith R.L. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 864-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), were transformed with pBAD18 or pTroA-D. Overnight cultures were diluted into 0.4% fresh Chelex 100-treated tryptone, 0.25% NaCl broth, grown for 3 h, induced with 10 mm arabinose for 15–30 min, and added to isotope-containing broth (100 nm65Zn2+ (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA) or 50 nm 54Mn2+ (Perkin-Elmer)). Culture samples, taken at intervals from 30 s to 5 min, were collected on 0.45-μm filters, rinsed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold medium, and processed for scintillation counting as described previously (39Kehres D.G. Janakiraman A. Slauch J.M. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3159-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Channels 401–945 were used to detect photons derived from γ radiation of 54Mn, whereas all channels were used to detect photons derived from 65Zn radiation. Metal Sensitivity Assays—Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 into fresh HRMM and plated on HRMM, 1% agarose plates containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and either 0 or 0.2% l-arabinose. Sterile 6-mm paper disks (Becton Dickinson) were placed in the center of the air-dried plates and impregnated with 10 μl of 0.5 m ZnCl2, 1 m MnCl2, or 1 m FeSO4. Following overnight incubation at 37 °C, the zones of inhibition were measured in blinded fashion. The measurements from three to seven independent experiments were used to calculate the mean zones of inhibition. The differences in mean zone sizes were compared using the two-tailed Student's t test; p values ≤ 0.01 were considered significant. Although Fe2+ (FeSO4) was used in these assays, the lability of this ion under aerobic conditions likely allowed for oxidation to the Fe3+ ion. Immunologic Reagents and Immunoblot Analysis—Polyclonal rat antiserum directed against TroA has been previously described (14Akins D.R. Robinson E. Shevchenko D. Elkins C. Cox D.L. Radolf J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5076-5086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antiserum was adsorbed with E. coli (pWSK129) lysates that had been electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. A mouse monoclonal antibody directed against E. coli σ70 was purchased from NeoClone Biotechnology (Madison, WI). To produce antisera directed against Gpm and TroR, the T. pallidum gpm and troR genes were amplified using primer pairs Gpm 5′ NcoI/Gpm 3′ EcoRI and TroR 5′ NcoI/TroR EcoRI, digested with NcoI and EcoRI, and cloned into the expression vector pProExHTa (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids (pHTa:Gpm and pHTa:TroR) encode isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible polyhistidine-tagged proteins, which were purified from induced E. coli cell lysates by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography and used to immunize 4-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described (29Hazlett K.R.O. Sellati T.J. Nguyen T.T. Cox D.L. Clawson M.L. Caimano M.J. Radolf J.D. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). T. pallidum, E. coli, and Y. pestis lysates were resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated with 1:1000 to 1:5000 dilutions of the appropriate antiserum or anti-σ70 monoclonal antibody and then probed with a 1:30,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat (or anti-mouse) (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). The immunoblots were developed using the SuperSignal Femto chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) followed by exposure to film (Amersham Biosciences). In the metal repression studies, the densitometric signals of immunoreactive bands were measured by an Alpha Innotech ChemiImager 4400 (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). Detection of tro Transcripts by RT-PCR—RNAs were isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) until the RNAs were free of contaminating DNA. RT-PCR reactions were performed with the Titan One-Step RT-PCR kit (Roche Applied Science) as previously described (10Jovanovíc T. Ascenso C. Hazlett K.R.O. Sikkink R. Krebs C. Litwiller R. Benson L.M. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Radolf J.D. Huynh B.H. Rusnak F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28439-28448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) using the RT-PCR primers listed in the supplemental table. For each primer set, three reactions were performed: (i) RT-PCR with RNA template, (ii) PCR with RNA template, and (iii) PCR with control template DNA. In reactions without RT, the Expand High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) was substituted for the RT/DNA polymerase enzyme mixture. Following the RT reaction (50 °C for 30 min), PCR was performed using the following parameters: 98 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s; 63 °C for 10 s; and 68 °C for 45 s followed by a single terminal extension at 68 °C for 3 min. Densitometry was performed as above. Apo-TroA binds Zn2+ and Mn2+ with Equal Affinity—TroA purified from E. coli contains 0.96 Zn2+ atoms/protein molecule (17Deka R.K. Lee Y.H. Hagman K.E. Shevchenko D. Lingwood C.A. Hasemann C.A. Norgard M.V. Radolf J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4420-4423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this result could reflect the relatively high level of Zn2+ in E. coli (41Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar"
https://openalex.org/W1993127355,"We report the characterization of an unusual adenylyl cyclase gene from Plasmodium falciparum, here designated PfACα. The level of mRNA expression is maximum during development of gametocytes (the sexual blood stage of the parasite life cycle). The gene is highly interrupted by 22 introns, and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed that there are multiple mRNA splice variants. One intron has three alternative 3′-splice sites that confer the potential to encode distinct forms of the enzyme using alternative start codons. Deduced amino acid sequences predict membrane-spanning regions, the number of which can vary between two and six depending on the splice variant. Expression of a synthetic form of two of these variants in Xenopus oocytes and in Dictyostelium adenylyl cyclase-deficient mutants, confirms that PfACα is a functional adenylyl cyclase. These results identify a novel mechanism in P. falciparum for the generation of multiple isoforms of a key, membrane-bound signaling molecule from a single genomic copy. Comparisons of the catalytic domains of PfACα and a second putative P. falciparum adenylyl cyclase (PfACβ) with those from other species reveal an unexpected similarity with adenylyl cyclases from certain prokaryotes including the cyanobacteria (blue green algae). In addition, the presence of an unusual active site substitution in a position that determines substrate specificity, also characteristic of these prokaryotic forms of the enzyme, further suggests a plastid origin for the Plasmodium cyclases.

One intron has three alternative 3′-splice sites that confer the potential to encode distinct forms of the enzyme using alternative start codons. Deduced amino acid sequences predict membrane-spanning regions, the number of which can vary between two and six depending on the splice variant. Expression of a synthetic form of two of these variants in Xenopus oocytes and in Dictyostelium adenylyl cyclase-deficient mutants, confirms that PfACα is a functional adenylyl cyclase. These results identify a novel mechanism in P. falciparum for the generation of multiple isoforms of a key, membrane-bound signaling molecule from a single genomic copy. Comparisons of the catalytic domains of PfACα and a second putative P. falciparum adenylyl cyclase (PfACβ) with those from other species reveal an unexpected similarity with adenylyl cyclases from certain prokaryotes including the cyanobacteria (blue green algae). In addition, the presence of an unusual active site substitution in a position that determines substrate specificity, also characteristic of these prokaryotic forms of the enzyme, further suggests a plastid origin for the Plasmodium cyclases. Adenylyl cyclase (AC) 1The abbreviations used are: AC, adenylyl cyclase; GC, guanylyl cyclase; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcriptase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PfAC, P. falciparum AC; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate. catalyzes synthesis of the signaling molecule cAMP from ATP. The most widely studied form of this enzyme, found in mammals and all higher eukaryotes, has a tandem pair of catalytic domains each preceded by a set of 6 transmembrane domains. The enzyme is activated via heterotrimeric G proteins after binding of an extracellular ligand to a G protein-coupled receptor (1Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). A soluble form of AC (also containing a pair of catalytic domains) has also been identified in mammals (2Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). It is G protein-independent and activated by bicarbonate ions (3Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). In lower eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the overall architecture of ACs varies between species. In all class III enzymes, however (the universal class of purine nucleotide cyclases, which includes guanylyl cyclases (GCs); Ref. 4Danchin A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 27: 109-162PubMed Google Scholar) there are a number of conserved amino acid residues within the catalytic domain that are vital for enzyme activity (5Tang W.J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Receptor-type ACs have been identified that possess a single transmembrane domain and a single catalytic domain (reminiscent of mammalian GCs) and are activated directly rather than by heterotrimeric G proteins (e.g. in trypanosomes, Refs. 6Taylor M.C. Muhia D.K. Baker D.A. Mondragon A. Schaap P.B. Kelly J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 104: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and 7Bieger B. Essen L.O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Many of the bacterial ACs have a modular structure with distinct non-catalytic regulatory domains. The filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena cylindrica has an unusual AC (cyaB1) with two membrane-spanning segments. The enzyme also has additional functional regions including a PAS domain (a ubiquitous small molecule receptor) and an allosteric cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (8Katayama M. Ohmori M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3588-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3672-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In mammals, the membrane-associated ACs (types I-IX) have roles in numerous biological processes including glycogen metabolism (10Sutherland E.W. Lakartidningen. 1971; 68: 4991-4995PubMed Google Scholar), olfaction (11Wong S.T. Trinh K. Hacker B. Chan G.C. Lowe G. Gaggar A. Xia Z. Gold G.H. Storm D.R. Neuron. 2000; 27: 487-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and nerve cell communication (12Greengard P. Science. 2001; 294: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Some bacterial pathogen exotoxins comprise ACs (e.g. from Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax; Ref. 13Leppla S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3162-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). In lower eukaryotes, the list of confirmed physiological roles for AC is growing, and cAMP levels are known to control development and differentiation in many species. In the protozoan Dictyostelium discoideum, cAMP signaling is extremely complex. One of the ACs (ACA) controls chemotactic aggregation of amoebae under starvation conditions (14Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and another (ACG) regulates spore germination (15van Es S. Virdy K.J. Pitt G.S. Meima M. Sands T.W. Devreotes P.N. Cotter D.A. Schaap P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23623-23625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, AC is thought to be important in regulating sexual development (16Maeda T. Mochizuki N. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7814-7818Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the ciliate Paramecium, synthesis of cyclic nucleotides is coupled with ion currents (17Schultz J.E. Klumpp S. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 27: 25-46PubMed Google Scholar); AC activity is associated with the ciliary membranes and is involved in locomotion. Synthesis of cAMP is stimulated by hyperpolarization of ciliary membranes, and this is inhibited by K+ channel blockers suggestive of a single unit acting as both a cyclase and an ion channel (18Schultz J.E. Klumpp S. Benz R. Schurhoff-Goeters W.J. Schmid A. Science. 1992; 255: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways have been implicated in sexual differentiation. Sexual blood stage parasites mediate disease transmission via Anopheles mosquitoes (whereas asexual blood stage parasites are responsible for disease pathology). Studies with phosphodiesterase inhibitors (19Kawamoto F. Alejo-Blanco R. Fleck S.L. Kawamoto Y. Sinden R.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have suggested that cGMP levels enhance a key step in male gametogenesis (exflagellation). Recently we have characterized two unusual bifunctional, membrane-bound GCs that are expressed during the sexual development of P. falciparum (20Carucci D.J. Witney A.A. Muhia D.K. Warhurst D.C. Schaap P. Meima M. Li J.L. Taylor M.C. Kelly J.M. Baker D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22147-22156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have also measured GC activity in mature gametocyte membranes, which is enhanced by the addition of a mosquito-derived factor (xanthurenic acid) that stimulates exflagellation (21Muhia D.K. Swales C.A. Deng W. Kelly J.M. Baker D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Several studies have provided evidence that the cAMP signaling pathway might be involved in development of the sexual blood stage of the life cycle (gametocytogenesis). Addition of cAMP to P. falciparum cultures at high parasitaemias led to greatly increased levels of gametocytes (22Kaushal D.C. Carter R. Miller L.H. Krishna G. Nature. 1980; 286: 490-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In another study, basal levels of AC activity were found to be equivalent in a gametocyte producer and non-producer strain; however, cAMP-dependent histone II-A kinase activity was significantly higher in the gametocyte producers (23Read L.K. Mikkelsen R.B. J. Parasitol. 1991; 77: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). AC activity in P. falciparum has been found to be distinct from that of the human red blood cell (24Read L.K. Mikkelsen R.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), although the enzymes responsible have not been characterized. Here we describe the identification of a gene encoding an unusual, functional AC from P. falciparum that may have been acquired by lateral gene transfer early in the evolution of this parasite. RT-PCR and DNA Cloning—RT-PCR was carried out using a Promega RT Access kit. Annealing temperatures varied according to the primer sequence (below). The primers listed were used to generate overlapping PCR products, which were then cloned into T Vector Easy (Stratagene) and sequenced using an ABI 377 automated sequencer. Extensive RT-PCR was carried out on multiple mRNA preparations using the 1S/7A primer pair to examine the splice variants that occur in this region. The following primer sequences are given.

Cultivation and Purification of P. falciparum Blood Stage Parasites—Gametocyte cultures were set up as described previously (21Muhia D.K. Swales C.A. Deng W. Kelly J.M. Baker D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), although incorporating a synchronization step to enrich for the various developmental stages. Briefly, an early passage of clone 3D7 (25Walliker D. Quakyi I.A. Wellems T.E. McCutchan T.F. Szarfman A. London W.T. Corcoran L.M. Burkot T.R. Carter R. Science. 1987; 236: 1661-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) was grown to over 5% mixed asexual parasitaemia and used to set up flasks (at 0.5% parasitaemia, 6% hematocrit) with human A+ red blood cells (RBC), which were then fed daily with 50:50 medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.005% hypoxanthine, 10.8 mm extra glucose, 5% albumax type II, and 5% human AB serum) and decreased to 3.4% hematocrit on day 5. The cultures were incubated with 1% O2, 3% CO2/balance N2. Synchronization of gametocytes was achieved using N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) at a final concentration of 50 mm (26Ponnudurai T. Lensen A.H. Meis J.F. Meuwissen J.H. Parasitology. 1986; 93: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Parasites were harvested at day 6 for early stage gametocytes (66% stage I, 28% stage II, and 6% stage III) and then on days 8, 15, and 20 for mid- (17% stage I, 67% stage II, and 16% stage III), late- (3% stage III, 8% stage IV, and 89% stage V), and exflagellated gametocytes, respectively. Gametocytes were Percoll-purified using a modification of the method described by Carter et al. (27Carter R. Ranford-Cartwright L. Alano P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 67-88PubMed Google Scholar). Percoll step gradients (30, 45, 54, 60, and 90% diluted with RPMI 1640) were prepared in 15-ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes. To harvest late gametocytes for exflagellation the cultures were pelleted and layered onto Percoll gradients made up in suspended activation medium (SAM) containing RPMI 1640, 25 mm Hepes, 1 μl CaCl2, and 1% decarbonated serum, pH 7.4 (28Ogwan'g R.A. Mwangi J.K. Githure J. Were J.B. Roberts C.R. Martin S.K. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1993; 49: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and washed three times in warm (37 °C) SAM. After washing, an equal volume of cold (4 °C) 100% human serum was added, giving about a 100 μl per pellet in total. They were left at room temperature until a sample spotted out onto a slide showed that exflagellation was underway. This normally occurred after 15 min. After 20 min 1 ml of Tri reagent (Sigma) was added, and they were stored at –80 °C until processing. Asexual blood stage parasites were synchronized by sorbitol treatment (29Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting—The RNA was resuspended in deionized formamide, gel-fractionated, and Northern blotted according to standard procedures (30Goda S.K. Minton N.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3357-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular cloning, A laboratory manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Blots (BrightStar™ Plus Nylon membrane, Ambion) were hybridized overnight with radiolabeled probes and visualized using phosphor screens (Kodak) scanned on a Storm Phosphorimager (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro mRNA Expression of a Synthetic PfACα—A DNA oligomer corresponding to variant 3 (Met1–Leu895) of the PfACα sequence was synthesized commercially (Bionexus Inc.) according to the preferred codon usage of Xenopus laevis, cloned into the pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced using an ABI 377 automated sequencer. The synthetic gene was then cloned (a BglII site had been incorporated at both ends) into an X. laevis expression vector pSP64T (incorporating a 5′ strong Kozak consensus (CACC)), which contains 5′- and 3′-untranslated X. laevis β-globulin sequences (32Gould G.W. Lienhard G.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9447-9452Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The plasmid construct (with the confirmed orientation) was linearized with SmaI, treated with proteinase K, phenol/chloroform extracted, and precipitated with sodium acetate. Capped PfACα cRNA was transcribed using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 (Ambion, Austin, TX). After completion of the reaction, template DNA was removed using DNase I (37 °C, 15 min). RNA was precipitated with LiCl, washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in DEPC-treated water. Expression in X. laevis Oocytes and Measurements of cAMP Levels—X. laevis oocytes were harvested, and connective tissue removed with collagenase treatment (2 mg ml–1 for 2 h on a shaker) (33Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Stages V to VI oocytes (Dumont, 1972) were selected and microinjected with cRNA (5–35 ng) encoding PfACα or with a comparable amount of DEPC-treated water (∼30 nl). Oocytes were incubated in Barth's solution (33Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) at 19 °C for 3 days. Quantification of in vivo accumulation of cAMP in oocytes was performed using an immunoassay kit (Alexis) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 15 oocytes were selected in triplicate and homogenized in a microcentrifuge tube containing 270 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The homogenate was then extracted three times with 5 volumes of water-saturated ether. Residual ether was removed by heating to 70 °C for 20 min, and the samples were stored at –80 °C until the assay was performed. Expression in Dictyostelium ACA-/ACG-null Mutants—Synthetic forms of variants 1 and 3 of PfACα were expressed as yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusions to facilitate detection and localization by Western blotting. The open reading frame (ORF) of variants 1 and 3 were amplified from the pCR-Blunt vector using oligonucleotides incorporating a BamHI and XhoI site. The BamHI/XhoI-digested fragment was cloned into the similarly digested vector pB17S, which placed the PfACα variants downstream of the constitutive actin15 promoter and in-frame with the YFP ORF at the C terminus, to generate vectors PfACα1Y and PfACα3Y. An AC-deficient Dictyostelium cell line (aca–/acg–) was transformed with PfACα1Y and PfACα3Y by electroporation, and the transformants were selected by growth in HL5 medium in the presence of 100 μg ml–1 of G418 (34Kim H.J. Chang W.T. Meima M. Gross J.D. Schaap P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30859-30862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Western Analysis—Dictyostelium cells were resuspended to 2 × 107 cells ml–1 in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2 (KK2), and the lysates size-fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:1000 diluted anti-GFP mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science). Detection was performed with the Supersignal chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 1:20,000 diluted horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Promega) as secondary antibody. cAMP Accumulation in Intact Cells—Cells were harvested from growth medium, resuspended in KK2 buffer at a concentration of 5 × 107 cells ml–1, and shaken at 120 rpm for 10 min at 22 °C. Aliquots (25 μl) of cell suspension were made up to a final volume of 30 μl in microtiter plate wells. Reactions were initiated by addition of 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and terminated by addition of 30 μl of 3.5% perchloric acid. Lysates were neutralized with KHCO3, and cAMP levels were determined using the isotope dilution assay (35Gilman A.G. Adv Cyc. Nuc. Res. 1972; 2: 9-24PubMed Google Scholar). Adenylyl Cyclase Assay in Cell Lysates—Cells were resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 107 cells ml–1 in ice-cold lysis buffer (250 mm sucrose in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) and lysed through nucleopore filters (pore size, 3 μm). Aliquots (10 μl) of cell lysate were added to 5 μl of divalent cation solution (Mg2+, Mn2+, or water) and incubated at 0 °C for 5 min. Reactions were initiated by addition of 5 μl of assay mixture (2 mm ATP, 0.8 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and 40 mm DTT in lysis buffer), and the samples were transferred to a 22 °C water bath. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 0.4 m EDTA, pH 8.0 and by boiling the samples for 1 min (36Meima M.E. Schaap P. Dev. Biol. 1999; 212: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). cAMP levels were assayed as above. Phylogenetic Analysis—Searches were performed using the WU-Blast2 Tool (www.ebi.ac.uk) to identify proteins in the SWISS-PROT Protein Knowledgebase with high sequence identity to either the single catalytic domain of PfACα or the proposed C2 domain of PfACβ. An alignment was compiled of the catalytic domains from representative prokaryote and eukaryote AC or GC sequences. Where proteins contained paired catalytic domains (e.g. PfACβ), only the C2 domain was included in the alignment. An initial alignment was performed using the MegAlign program (DNAstar), which was modified manually. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Fitch-Margoliash and Least-Squares Distance Methods program FITCH, after protein distances had been calculated using PROTDIST. Node robustness was assessed by 100 bootstrap replications (data set for bootstrap analysis was generated with SEQBOOT). PROTDIST, FITCH and SEQBOOT are part of the PHYLIP package (37Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). Maximum parsimony (PROTPARS), and neighbor joining (NEIGHBOR) methods were also used to generate phylogenies to confirm the results obtained by the above method. Identification of a Gene Encoding a Putative AC and the Presence of mRNA Splice Variants—Conserved motifs within the catalytic domain of ACs from diverse eukaryotic species were used in BLAST searches of P. falciparum preliminary sequence data (Sanger Centre, TIGR, and Stanford University). Initially a single match was found in the chromosome 14 data base (TIGR). However, it was clear that the various motifs were non-contiguous and that the sequence was highly interrupted by introns. RT-PCR was performed on total RNA extracted from mixed blood stage parasites (clone 3D7, see “Experimental Procedures”) to determine the number and position of introns in the sequence. Examination of the upstream and downstream sequence data (TIGR chromosome 14 shotgun, unfinished sequence data) for potential splice sites and extensive RT-PCR analysis revealed a total of 22 exons and 21 introns (Fig. 1) predicting a protein size of 81.2 kDa. Initial RT-PCR analysis indicated that the first in-frame start codon is in exon 5. This suggests that introns 1–4 are situated in the 5′-untranslated region of the gene. However, further RT-PCR analysis of the 5′-region revealed the presence of mRNA molecules corresponding to additional mRNA splice variants. The first in-frame stop codon is in exon 22 indicating the predicted position of the C terminus of the protein. The majority of the RT-PCR products examined conformed to the above arrangement (variant 1). However, further analysis demonstrated that intron 3 contains alternative 3′-splice sites (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2A). In two instances this results in two small introns (rather than a single large one) and an additional exon (exon 3A, Fig. 1, A and B). Also, there are two versions of the small intron 3 that give rise to different deduced N-terminal protein sequences (variants 2 and 3, Fig. 1, A and B). Intriguingly, in variant 3 all exons are contiguous resulting in a full-length protein of 108 kDa. Variant 2 predicts a protein of intermediate size (98.2 kDa, Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1C, the protein sequences encoded by variants 1, 2, and 3 have differing numbers of predicted transmembrane domains (2, 5, and 6, respectively). The nucleotide sequences toward the 5′-end of variants 1–3 (near to their predicted translation start codons) obtained by sequencing RT-PCR products are shown in Fig. 2A. The precise positions of the introns and the variant intron junctions are shown in relation to the exons. Fig. 2B shows the differences in N-terminal amino acid sequence encoded by the three variants. Relationship of PfACα to a Second AC from P. falciparum— The majority of the single catalytic domain of PfACα is encoded by exons 16 and 17 toward the C terminus. Surprisingly this sequence is most closely related to an AC from the cyanobacterium Trichodesmium erythraeum (28% identity and 49% similarity over 224 amino acids) as determined by a BLAST search (38Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70747) Google Scholar). In addition to PfACα, we have also identified a second putative AC (here designated PfACβ) sequence on chromosome 8inthe P. falciparum genome data (plasmodb.org/). PfACβ also has a high degree of relatedness to cyanobacterial ACs. However, it has a double catalytic domain (C1 and C2) at the N terminus, which is topologically more similar to the soluble AC of mammals than to the membrane-bound forms. Fig. 3 shows an alignment of the catalytic domains of PfACα and PfACβ (C2) with those of the C1 (type V) and C2 (type II) domains of mammalian AC for which a crystal structure of the heterodimer is available (39Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 40Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The initial alignment was performed using the ClustalW program (41Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55761) Google Scholar) but was modified manually to introduce gaps (where possible) between the areas of secondary structure of the mammalian ACs. The catalytic domain of the homodimeric, human retinal GC is included in the alignment to emphasize the diagnostic residues that distinguish ACs from GCs. The catalytic domain of a cyanobacterial cyclase (T. erythraeum), and the C2 catalytic domain of the human soluble AC are also included for comparison. The majority of the residues involved in catalysis in both ACs and GCs are conserved in the P. falciparum homologues (see legend to Fig. 3). The critical residue, however, which determines purine specificity in nucleotide cyclases, is a lysine in both PfACα (Lys576) and PfACβ (Lys164) and in all known ACs. A glutamic acid residue is present at the equivalent position in all GCs. The sequence data therefore suggest strongly that both PfACα and PfACβ are ACs. Remarkably, a highly conserved aspartic acid residue in the purine-binding pocket (see Fig. 3) of ACs is replaced by a serine or a threonine residue in PfACα and PfACβ, respectively. This feature is characteristic of prokaryotic forms of AC (see below). Phylogenetic Analysis of PfACα and PfACβ—Searches were performed with the catalytic domains of both PfACα and PfACβ to determine the most closely related sequences in the data bases. Although both sequences show an unexpectedly high sequence similarity with certain bacterial ACs, it is clear that the two Plasmodium proteins are not closely related to each other. PfACα has only a single catalytic domain containing all the residues required for enzyme activity, whereas PfACβ has two catalytic domains (C1 and C2) each containing specific motifs that would be required for activity. This profound difference between the catalytic domains is reflected in a shared sequence identity of only 19% (using the C2 domain of PfACβ) and 22% (using the C1 domain of PfACβ) at the amino acid level. This is reinforced by the grouping of the proteins into two distinct lineages of ACs in a phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 4A). In this analysis of the catalytic domains, PfACα clusters strongly with putative ACs from other apicomplexan species (bootstrap value of 100%) but also with ACs from prokaryotes including cyanobacteria, spirochaetes and certain proteobacterial species (bootstrap value 50%). By contrast PfACβ groups strongly with all known examples of soluble ACs (bootstrap value of 100%). This grouping of PfACβ reflects a shared double catalytic domain. The group of soluble ACs includes the mammalian bicarbonate sensor (3Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) together with hypothetical proteins from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, Chloroflexus aurantiacus (a green non-sulfur bacteria), and the Dictyostelium sGCA, which is in fact a GC (42Roelofs J. Meima M. Schaap P. Van Haastert P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic analysis also shows that this class of cyclases, despite having a double catalytic domain, is quite distinct from the membrane-bound G protein-dependent ACs. A key amino acid residue in the active site, which determines substrate specificity is also indicated in Fig. 4A. Membrane-bound G protein-dependent ACs all have an aspartic acid residue in this position, whereas ACs in the 2 prokaryotic clades have a serine/threonine residue. Analysis suggests that this is a defining feature of these 2 classes of cyclases (discussed further below). The alanine residue in the Dictyostelium sequence at this position probably reflects that it is a functional GC. Fig. 4B shows an alignment of ACs from various species showing the two non-contiguous segments of the enzyme active site that are involved in purine binding, and highlighting the residues that define substrate specificity. In all cases the crucial lysine residue (replaced by arginine in Chloroflexus) is present, but the key aspartic acid residue invariant in all membrane-bound G protein"
https://openalex.org/W2149712976,"Plants synthesize p-aminobenzoate (pABA) in chloroplasts and use it for folate synthesis in mitochondria. It has generally been supposed that pABA exists as the free acid in plant cells and that it moves between organelles in this form. Here we show that fruits and leaves of tomato and leaves of a diverse range of other plants have a high capacity to convert exogenously supplied pABA to its β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (pABA-Glc), whereas yeast and Escherichia coli do not. High performance liquid chromatography analysis indicated that much of the endogenous pABA in fruit and leaf tissues is esterified and that the total pool of pABA (free plus esterified) varies greatly between tissues (from 0.2 to 11 nmol g–1 of fresh weight). UDP-glucose:pABA glucosyltransferase activity was readily detected in fruit and leaf extracts, and the reaction was found to be freely reversible. p-Aminobenzoic acid β-D-glucopyranosyl ester esterase activity was also detected in extracts. Subcellular fractionation indicated that the glucosyltransferase and esterase activities are predominantly if not solely cytosolic. Taken together, these results show that reversible formation of pABA-Glc in the cytosol is interposed between pABA production in chloroplasts and pABA consumption in mitochondria. As pABA is a hydrophobic weak acid, its uncharged form is membrane-permeant, and its anion is consequently prone to distribute itself spontaneously among subcellular compartments according to their pH. Esterification of pABA may eliminate such errant behavior and provide a readily reclaimable storage form of pABA as well as a substrate for membrane transporters.

Esterification of pABA may eliminate such errant behavior and provide a readily reclaimable storage form of pABA as well as a substrate for membrane transporters. Tetrahydrofolate and its derivatives, collectively termed folates, are essential cofactors for one-carbon reactions in eukaryotes and most prokaryotes. Bacteria, fungi, and plants synthesize folates de novo, but humans and other higher animals do not and therefore need a dietary supply (1Bailey L.B. Gregory III, J.F. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 2Cossins E.A. Davies D.D. The Biochemistry of Plants. 11. Academic Press, New York1987: 317-353Google Scholar). For humans, a major part of this supply comes from plants, and there is consequently interest in engineering food plants for enhanced folate content (3Bouis H.E. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: S491-S494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Scott J. Rébeillé F. Fletcher J. J. Sci. Food Agric. 2000; 80: 795-824Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This engineering approach to human nutrition, termed biofortification, depends on understanding the synthesis, metabolism, and transport of folates and their precursors in plants. The folate molecule is tripartite, comprising pteridine, glutamate, and p-aminobenzoate (pABA) 1The abbreviations used are: pABA, p-aminobenzoic acid; pABA-Glc, p-aminobenzoyl β-d-glucopyranoside; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LC-MS, liqiud chromatography-mass spectrometry. moieties (Fig. 1A). In plants, biochemical and genomic data indicate that the pteridine moiety is made in the cytosol, that the pABA moiety is made in the chloroplast, and that the two are coupled together and glutamylated in the mitochondrion (Fig. 1B) (reviewed in Refs. 5Rébeillé F. Douce R. Kruger N.J. Hill S.A. Ratcliffe R.G. Regulation of Primary Metabolic Pathways in Plants. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 53-99Crossref Google Scholar and 6Hanson A.D. Gregory III, J.F. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the course of folate synthesis, pABA must therefore exit chloroplasts, cross the cytosol, and enter mitochondria. This elaborate trajectory is not seen in bacteria and fungi, in which the entire pathway is cytosolic (7Cherest H. Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14056-14063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8Green J.M. Nichols B.P. Matthews R.G. Cellular and Molecular Biology.in: Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 665-673Google Scholar). Recent reviews of plant folate synthesis have tacitly assumed that pABA exists as the free acid in plant cells and that it moves between organelles in this form (5Rébeillé F. Douce R. Kruger N.J. Hill S.A. Ratcliffe R.G. Regulation of Primary Metabolic Pathways in Plants. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 53-99Crossref Google Scholar, 6Hanson A.D. Gregory III, J.F. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This assumption is questionable because there is no information about the endogenous level of free pABA in plants, but there are various reports of pABA conjugates. Thus, the β-D-glucopyranosyl ester of pABA (pABA-Glc) and N-acetyl and N-formyl pABA have been found as metabolites of supplied pABA in cell cultures of Eucalyptus and Solanum spp (9Furuya T. Asada Y. Mizobata S. Matsuura Y. Hamada H. Phytochemistry. 1998; 49: 109-111Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Panjaitan T.S. Syahrani A. Indrayanto G. J. Planar Chromat. Mod. TLC. 2000; 13: 114-118Google Scholar, 11Syahrani A. Ratnasari E. Indrayanto G. Wilkins A.L. Phytochemistry. 1999; 51: 615-620Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and triterpenoid pABA esters have been identified in cucurbit seeds (12Appendino G. Jakupovic J. Belloro E. Marchesini A. Fitoterapia. 2000; 71: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The N-glucoside of pABA-Glc has been reported from plant cell cultures (9Furuya T. Asada Y. Mizobata S. Matsuura Y. Hamada H. Phytochemistry. 1998; 49: 109-111Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) but is probably a chemical artifact. Arylamines such as pABA and pABA-Glc readily condense with glucose and other aldoses (13Ellis G.P. Chem. Ind. 1966; 22: 902-903Google Scholar), and this reaction can occur in culture media (14Bacher A. Gilch B. Rappold H. Lingens F. Z. Naturforsch. Section C Biosciences. 1973; 28: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and during alcohol extraction (15Kitamura M. Nakao M. Yanagisawa I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1960; 47: 60-68Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The possible presence of pABA esters or other conjugates raises two questions relating to the folate synthesis pathway and its engineering. First, are such derivatives the major form of pABA in plants? This is so for the pABA analog p-hydroxybenzoate, of which >98% accumulates as derivatives (16Siebert M. Sommer S. Li S.M. Wang Z.X. Severin K. Heide L. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Were this true of pABA, it would suggest that pABA derivatives could be reclaimable storage pools or substrates for membrane transport. Second, are the contents of pABA and its derivatives large as compared with the pABA demand for folate synthesis? If not, enhancing the capacity for pABA synthesis would need to be included in engineering strategies to raise plant folate levels. To answer these questions, we used radiotracer methods to investigate pABA conjugate formation and developed HPLC procedures to quantify free and conjugated pABA. Having identified pABA-Glc as an important conjugate, we investigated the enzyme activities responsible for its formation and reconversion to pABA and showed that these activities are located in the cytosol. We focused particularly on tomato fruit and pea leaves because folate synthesis has been studied in both systems and because tomatoes are our choice for engineering (5Rébeillé F. Douce R.

Chemicals and Reagents—[Ring-14C]p-aminobenzoic acid (55 mCi mmol–1) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Specific radioactivities were adjusted with unlabeled pABA (K+ salt). [14C]pABA-Glc (55 mCi mmol–1) and N-glucosyl [14C]pABA were isolated by preparative TLC from tomato pericarp disks incubated with [14C]pABA, as described below. N-Glucosyl pABA was prepared by heating pABA with glucose in aqueous solution (13Ellis G.P. Chem. Ind. 1966; 22: 902-903Google Scholar). All other biochemicals were from Sigma. AG-50W-X8 and AG 4-X4 ion-exchange resins were from Bio-Rad. The former was prepared just before use by treating 1-ml columns successively with 5 ml of 6 m NH4OH, 10 ml of water, 5 ml of 6 m HCl, and 10 ml of water. Silica Gel 60 F254 TLC plates were from Merck. Plants and Growth Conditions—Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Micro-Tom), melon (Cucumis melo), and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) were grown in potting soil in a chamber (16-h days, photosynthetic photon flux density 200 μmol of photons m–2 s–1, 23 °C/8-h nights, 20 °C). Pea (Pisum sativum cv. Laxton's Progress 9 or Little Marvel) was grown in vermiculite at 20 °C in 12-h days (200 μmol of photons m–2 s–1) for 10 days. Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) was grown in potting soil at 23–30 °C in 12-h days (200 μmol of photons m–2 s–1). Maize (Zea mays) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) were greenhouse-grown. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea) were purchased locally. [14C]pABA Metabolism by Plant Tissues—Disks (1-cm diameter) or squares (1 cm2) were cut from all tissues except Arabidopsis leaves, which were used whole. The surface of the midrib was shaved from the abaxial surface of leaf tissues, and pericarp disks were given eight shallow radial cuts on the inner face. [14C]pABA dissolved in 3–10 μl of water was applied to the cut surfaces. Tissues were incubated in Petri dishes for 6 h at 24 °C in light (200 μmol of photons m–2 s–1), and then shaken (100 rpm) for 15 min in 5 ml of 0.1 mm pABA to remove non-absorbed label, which was quantified by scintillation counting. Tissues were extracted by grinding in 2 ml of semifrozen methanol. Aliquots (60 μl) of the methanol extract were separated by TLC on Silica Gel 60 F254 plates developed with ethyl acetate:methanol:water (solvent A, 77:13:10, v/v/v). Radioactive zones were detected by autoradiography and scraped from the plate for scintillation counting. pABA and its metabolites were visualized in UV light [14C]pABA Metabolism by Yeast and Escherichia coli—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 971/6c (Mata ade2-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ura3-1 trp1Δ2 can1) (18Nardese V. Gutlich M. Brambilla A. Carbone M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was cultured at 30 °C in minimal medium with appropriate supplements as described (17Basset G. Quinlivan E.P. Ziemak M.J. Diaz de la Garza R. Fischer M. Schiffmann S. Bacher A. Gregory III, J.F. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12489-12494Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). E. coli strain K12 was cultured at 37 °C in minimal medium (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Exponentially growing 40-ml cultures received 3.7 μCi (yeast) or 1.8 μCi (E. coli) of [14C]pABA (55 mCi mmol–1) and were incubated until 28% (yeast) or 46% (E. coli) of the label had been taken up. Cells were then pelleted, extracted in methanol, and analyzed by TLC as above. Preparation and Quantification of pABA-Glc—Batches (5 g) of 1-cm disks cut from mature green tomato pericarp were supplied as above with unlabeled pABA (K+ salt, 1 μmol/disk) for 16 h, frozen in liquid N2, and pulverized. The ground material was extracted successively with 25 and 10 ml of methanol. After centrifuging to clear, the pooled extracts were concentrated in vacuo at 28 °C to ∼1 ml, and 0.5-ml samples were fractionated on a silica gel column (70–230 mesh, 2.5 × 18 cm) equilibrated in and developed with solvent A. Fractions containing pABA-Glc were identified by TLC, pooled, dried in vacuo, and redissolved in 2 ml of methanol; overall pABA-Glc yield was 51%. NMR analyses were carried out on this sample. pABA-Glc was further purified by HPLC on a 5-μm Discovery C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, Supelco) eluted with methanol:water (70:30, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. Peaks were detected by absorbance at 295 nm and by fluorescence (290-nm excitation, 340-nm emission). pABA-Glc was quantified spectrophotometrically either directly or as free pABA after hydrolysis in 0.1 m HCl at 80 °C for 3 h, drying in vacuo, and redissolving in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. The molar extinction coefficient (ϵ) for pABA was taken as 15,000 at 267 nm (20Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. 3rd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1986: 116-117Google Scholar). An ϵ value of 18,120 at 296 nm (in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.2) was calculated for pABA-Glc from hydrolysis data. NMR and LC-MS Analyses—For NMR analysis, the sample was dried under nitrogen and redissolved in 0.5 ml of CD3OD. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were acquired at 500 MHz on a Varian Unity spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA) using a 5-mm probe. Acquisition parameters were such as to give close to fully relaxed spectra for integration of signal intensities (90o pulses, 15-s recycle time). LC-MS analysis was conducted using a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with APCI interface in selective reactions monitoring MS2 mode. N2 pressure was 80 p.s.i. for the sheath and 10 p.s.i. auxiliary. The vaporizer was held at 500 °C, and the heated capillary was held at 200 °C. The corona current was set to 3 kA, maintaining a voltage of ∼4 kV. Argon was used as a collision cell gas at a pressure of ∼2.5 mTorr and a collision energy of 10 V. The 5-μm Synergi Polar-RP column (50 × 4.6 mm, Phenomenex) was eluted with 5 mm ammonium formate, 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid using a linear methanol gradient (2–85% in 5 min) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min–1. Estimation of pABA and Folates—For pABA analyses, tissue (0.5 g of fresh weight) was ground in 5 ml of semifrozen methanol; the supernatant was removed, and the residue was re-extracted by shaking with another 2 ml of methanol for 5 min at 22 °C. Two samples of the pooled extracts were dried in vacuo; one (for free pABA estimation) was dissolved in 2 ml of water, and the other (for conjugated pABA estimation) was dissolved in 2 ml of 0.1 m HCl and heated at 80 °C for 2–3 h. Tests with [14C]pABA-Glc, N-glucosyl [14C]pABA, and N-(p-aminobenzoyl)-l-glutamate established that these conditions give essentially full hydrolysis of pABA-Glc or N-glucosyl pABA but negligible (∼2%) cleavage of the amide bond between pABA and glutamate and so do not release significant pABA from folates. The extracts were then applied to 1-ml AG 50 (H+) columns, which were washed with 15 ml of water (for free pABA) or 5 ml of 1 m HCl followed by 15 ml of water (for conjugated pABA). The columns were eluted with 5 ml of 1 m NH4OH, and the eluates were lyophilized, redissolved in 0.2 ml of 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 3.7, and partitioned against 0.6 ml of ethyl acetate. pABA was recovered from the organic phase by back extraction with 0.18 ml of 50 mm NaOH, which was neutralized with acetic acid. Samples of the neutralized extract were injected onto a 5-μm Discovery C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, Supelco) and eluted with 0.5% acetic acid:methanol (80:20, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. Peaks were detected by fluorescence (290-nm excitation, 340-nm emission). The pABA peak was quantified relative to standards. Data were corrected for the recovery of pABA spikes added to plant samples at the start of extraction; recoveries were 28–64% and 37–44% for unhydrolyzed and hydrolyzed samples, respectively. Free pABA values were further corrected for the proportion of pABA-Glc spikes (11–29%) that broke down to pABA during processing. Tests with [14C]pABA-Glc showed that ∼10% breakdown occurred during the AG 50 step alone. Similar tests with N-glucosyl [14C]pABA indicated ∼30% breakdown during this step. Folates in Arabidopsis leaves were extracted according to Ref. 21Wilson S.D. Horne D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar and then isolated by affinity chromatography, conjugase-treated, and determined by HPLC essentially as described (22Pfeiffer C.M. Rogers L.M. Gregory J.F. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1997; 45: 407-413Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The folates were quantified using fluorescence detection at 295 and 356 nm for excitation and emission, respectively (23Gregory III, J.F. Manley D.B. Day B.P.F. J. Nutr. 1984; 114: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—Pea (cv. Laxton's Progress 9) mitochondria and chloroplasts were isolated and purified on Percoll gradients as described (24Douce R. Bourguignon J. Brouquisse R. Neuburger M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 403-415Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 25Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A), and broken by 4–5 cycles of freezing and thawing. Organellar extracts were cleared by centrifugation (15 min, 16,000 × g), and glycerol was added to give a final concentration of 10% (v/v). To prepare a cytosol-enriched fraction, 15 g of pea leaves were homogenized in a Waring blender in 100 ml of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.33 m sorbitol, 5 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, using three 3-s pulses at setting 3. Chloroplasts and mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation (3 min at 500 × g and 20 min at 18,000 × g, respectively), and the resulting supernatant was desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A containing 10% glycerol. The chloroplast stromal marker NADP-linked glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the mitochondrial matrix marker fumarase, and the cytosol marker 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase were assayed as described (26Roje S. Wang H. McNeil S.D. Raymond R.K. Appling D.R. Shachar-Hill Y. Bohnert H.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36089-36096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Trossat C. Nolte K.D. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fumarase was inactivated by freezing and thus was assayed in fresh samples. Other activities were measured after freezing in liquid N2 and storing at –80 °C. Assay of pABA Glucosyltransferase and pABA-Glc Esterase—Activities were measured at 30 °C; product formation was essentially linear with time. pABA glucosyltransferase was assayed in the forward (pABA-Glc synthesis) direction in 10- or 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm UDP-glucose, and the indicated amounts of [14C]pABA and glycerol. After 1–3 h, [14C]pABA-Glc was quantified by TLC as above using 5-μl aliquots of reaction mixtures. Alternatively, assay mixtures were applied to 1-ml columns of AG 4-X8 (OH–) from which [14C]pABA-Glc was eluted with water (5 ml) and counted. pABA-Glc esterase was assayed in 5-μl reaction mixtures containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 nCi (0.36 nmol) of [14C]pABA-Glc. [14C]pABA release was quantified after 1–3 h by TLC. Alternatively, assay mixtures were applied to 1-ml columns of AG 4-X8 (OH–); after washing with 20 ml of water, [14C]pABA was eluted with 5 ml of 1 n HCl and counted. Reverse-direction pABA glucosyltransferase assays were the same except that they contained 20 mm UDP. Partial Purification of pABA Glucosyltransferase from Pea Leaves— Pea (cv. Laxton's Progress 9) leaves (20 g) were pulverized in liquid N2 and extracted in 60 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm sodium ascorbate, and 3% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone. After centrifuging to clear (18,000 × g, 20 min), 50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 was added to give a concentration of 30% (w/v), and the sample was held on ice for 30 min. After centrifuging (18,000 × g, 20 min), the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was adjusted to 40% (w/v) polyethylene glycol, held on ice for 2 h, and recentrifuged (40,000 × g, 1 h). One-quarter of the resulting pellet (1.5 mg protein) was redissolved in 1.2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm NaCl and applied to a 1-ml Mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences), which was developed with an NaCl gradient (20–410 mm), collecting 0.3-ml fractions. pABA glucosyltransferase activity eluted in one major peak at ∼300 mm NaCl and in at least three minor peaks at lower NaCl concentration. The most active fraction (∼100-fold enriched relative to the crude extract) was desalted on a 1-ml Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Massive Conversion of pABA to Its Glucose Ester by Tomato Fruit Tissue—When pericarp disks from mature green fruit were incubated with various doses of [14C]pABA for 6 h, around 90% of the pABA was taken up regardless of the dose size (Fig. 2A), suggesting a non-saturable uptake mechanism. The absorbed pABA was in large part converted to a product with the TLC mobility (Rf ∼0.4) reported for pABA-Glc (11Syahrani A. Ratnasari E. Indrayanto G. Wilkins A.L. Phytochemistry. 1999; 51: 615-620Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the conversion being about 50% of uptake at the three lower doses and 21% at the highest (Fig. 2, A and B). The product accumulation rate at the highest dose (∼1 μmol g–1 of fresh weight in 6 h) is close to the pABA-Glc formation rates in Solanum cells grown in pABA-rich media (10Panjaitan T.S. Syahrani A. Indrayanto G. J. Planar Chromat. Mod. TLC. 2000; 13: 114-118Google Scholar, 11Syahrani A. Ratnasari E. Indrayanto G. Wilkins A.L. Phytochemistry. 1999; 51: 615-620Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The product migrating at Rf ∼0.4 was confirmed to be pABA-Glc, the β-D-glucopyranosyl ester of pABA (Fig. 2C), by UV spectroscopy (λmax, = 299 nm), by release of pABA upon mild acid hydrolysis, by LC-MS ([M+NH4+] = 317), and by 1H NMR. The positions and coupling constants of characteristic 1H NMR aromatic and glucosyl resonances of the product (3.69 ppm, 1H, dd, J = 11 Hz, 5 Hz, H′-6a; 3.85 ppm, 1H, dd, J = 11 Hz, ∼1Hz, H′-6b; 5.65 ppm, 1H, d, J = 8 Hz; 6.63 ppm, 2H, d, J = 8 Hz, H-4 and H-6; 7.81 ppm, 2H, d,J = 8 Hz, H-3 and H-7) matched the previously reported NMR signals of pABA-Glc but not those of other plant metabolic derivatives of pABA (9Furuya T. Asada Y. Mizobata S. Matsuura Y. Hamada H. Phytochemistry. 1998; 49: 109-111Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 11Syahrani A. Ratnasari E. Indrayanto G. Wilkins A.L. Phytochemistry. 1999; 51: 615-620Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The quality of the spectra was sufficient to rule out the presence of other pABA derivatives at levels exceeding 10% of the pABA-Glc. In addition to the pABA-Glc band, TLC showed a diffuse labeled band at Rf ∼0.25, which is characteristic of the N-glucoside of pABA. Since this band was present in controls that received no [14C]pABA until extraction or that were heat-killed before incubation (Fig. 2B), and since the N-glucoside forms spontaneously and easily (13Ellis G.P.

Diverse Plants Accumulate pABA Glucose Ester but Bacteria and Yeast Do Not—To find whether pABA-Glc formation occurs in leaves as well as fruits and whether it is common among angiosperms, leaf samples of tomato and eight other species were given [14C]pABA for 6 h. In all cases, [14C]pABA uptake was nearly complete, the average being 93%, and label accumulated in pABA-Glc (Fig. 3, A and B). The proportion of absorbed pABA converted to pABA-Glc was in most species between 32 and 78%, which is similar to tomato fruit; only melon and cotton showed a lower conversion (10–12%). As with tomato fruit, TLC analysis showed a labeled band in the pABA N-glucoside position in all samples. Two species (Arabidopsis and spinach) also had prominent low mobility labeled bands, presumably representing additional pABA metabolites (Fig. 3A). These bands were shown not to correspond to N-acetyl pABA (Rf, 0.62), p-hydroxybenzoate (Rf, 0.72), or folates (Rf ∼0) but were not further investigated in this study. To test whether pABA-Glc accumulates in other folate-synthesizing organisms, growing cultures of E. coli and yeast were given doses of [14C]pABA calculated to be well in excess of the pABA requirement for folate synthesis and incubated until >25% of the dose had been taken up. TLC analysis of methanol extracts of the harvested cells showed that ≤0.1% of the absorbed label was present as pABA-Glc. This negative result is consistent with the lack of reports of pABA-Glc in E. coli, whose pABA metabolism has been thoroughly studied (14Bacher A. Gilch B. Rappold H. Lingens F. Z. Naturforsch. Section C Biosciences. 1973; 28: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 28Rappold H. Bacher A. Z. Naturforsch. Section C Biosciences. 1976; 31: 285-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Much of the Endogenous pABA in Plants Is in Conjugated Form—That plant tissues rapidly convert exogenously supplied pABA to pABA-Glc implies that much of their endogenous pABA may exist in this form. To investigate this point, we analyzed free and conjugated forms of pABA by a protocol entailing methanol extraction, cation-exchange chromatography, ethyl acetate partitioning, and HPLC with fluorescence detection. A mild acid hydrolysis step was inserted after methanol extraction to release pABA from esters and other labile conjugates. The hydrolysis conditions (0.1 M HCl at 80 °C for 2–3 h) were selected to obtain essentially complete pABA release from pABA-Glc (and N-glucosyl pABA) without significant release of pABA from folates and without major losses of pABA via Maillard reactions with contaminating sugars. Since pABA-Glc undergoes some spontaneous hydrolysis during extraction and chromatography, representative samples were spiked with purified pABA-Glc to enable correction for such breakdown. Fig. 4A is an illustrative HPLC fluorescence trace showing that the pABA peak is symmetrical, well resolved from other peaks, and substantially larger when the sample is hydrolyzed. Data of this type for tomato pericarp and for leaves of tomato, Arabidopsis, and two pea cultivars are summarized in Fig. 4B. For free pABA, both the corrected value and the correction, often large, applied for pABA-Glc breakdown are indicated (Fig. 4B). Folate contents are included for comparison (Fig. 4B, inset). Two sets of generalizations can be made from these data. First, the pABA contents after hydrolysis (hereafter termed total pABA) cover a wide span (from 0.2 to 11 nmol g–1 of fresh weight) and vary from about 3–600% of the folate content. Second, in all cases except tomato leaves (whose total pABA content is exceptionally low), the corrected free pABA values are ≤20% of total pABA, suggesting that ≥80% of pABA is in conjugated form in vivo. pABA Glucose Ester Is Formed by a Reversible UDP-glucosyltransferase Reaction—UDP-glucose:pABA glucosyltransferase activity was readily detected in desalted extracts of mature green tomato pericarp and pea leaves, and the activities measured at near saturating substrate concentrations were sufficient to account for the observed in vivo rates of pABA-Glc formation (Fig. 5A). Almost no activity was detected when ADP-glucose replaced UDP-glucose (Fig. 5A). Using an enzyme preparation from pea leaves (∼100-fold enriched relative to the crude extract), the UDP-glucosyltransferase reaction was shown to be reversible (Fig. 5B), as has been reported for glucosyltransferases that produce other carboxyl"
https://openalex.org/W2068817417,"The amyloid β peptides (Aβ) are the major components of the senile plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Aβ peptides are generated from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. β-Secretase (BACE), a type-I transmembrane aspartyl protease, cleaves APP first to generate a 99-amino acid membrane-associated fragment (CT99) containing the N terminus of Aβ peptides. γ-Secretase, a multi-protein complex, then cleaves within the transmembrane region of CT99 to generate the C termini of Aβ peptides. The production of Aβ peptides is, therefore, dependent on the activities of both BACE and γ-secretase. The cleavage of APP by BACE is believed to be a prerequisite for γ-secretase-mediated processing. In the present study, we provide evidence both in vitro and in cells that BACE-mediated cleavage between amino acid residues 34 and 35 (Aβ-34 site) in the Aβ region is dependent on γ-secretase activity. In vitro, the Aβ-34 site is processed specifically by BACE1 and BACE2, but not by cathepsin D, a closely related aspartyl protease. Moreover, the cleavage of the Aβ-34 site by BACE1 or BACE2 occurred only when Aβ 1– 40 peptide, a γ-secretase cleavage product, was used as substrate, not the non-cleaved CT99. In cells, overexpression of BACE1 or BACE2 dramatically increased the production of the Aβ 1–34 species. More importantly, the cellular production of Aβ 1–34 species induced by overexpression of BACE1 or BACE2 was blocked by a number of known γ-secretase inhibitors in a concentration-dependent manner. These γ-secretase inhibitors had no effect on enzymatic activity of BACE1 or BACE2 in vitro. Our data thus suggest that γ-secretase cleavage of CT99 is a prerequisite for BACE-mediated processing at Aβ-34 site. Therefore, BACE and γ-secretase activity can be mutually dependent.

Second, in an in vitro cell-free assay system, the N-terminally truncated form of APP, CT99 (or CT100), has been demonstrated as an efficient substrate for γ-secretase (16Li Y.-M. Lai M.-T. Xu M.

Therefore, removal of the N-terminal region of APP seems to be essential for γ-secretase-mediated cleavage. In the present study, we found that BACE-mediated cleavage at the Aβ-34 site is dependent on the γ-secretase activity. BACE cleaves the Aβ-34 site in vitro only within Aβ 1– 40 peptide, a product from γ-secretase, not the site in the non-cleaved CT99 fragment. Moreover, the cellular production of Aβ 1–34 species induced by overexpression of BACE1 or BACE2 was blocked by known γ-secretase inhibitors in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the γ-secretase inhibitors had no effect on enzymatic activity of BACE1 or BACE2 in vitro. Our results suggest that the cleavage activity of BACE at the Aβ-34 site, both in vitro and in cells, is dependent on γ-secretase activity. Therefore, BACE and γ-secretase activity can be mutually dependent. BACE1 and BACE2 Expression and Purification—Cloning of human BACE1 and BACE2 cDNA and purification of human BACE1 and BACE2 full-length protein from transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells have been described previously (18Shi X.-P.

Treatment of CT100-Flag with aminopeptidase (Sigma) resulted in a CT99-Flag with the amino acid residue Asp at its N terminus. CT99-flag was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis and by its reactivity with a neo-epitope-specific antibody, FCA-18, purchased from Dr. F. Checler (20Barelli H. Lebeau A. Vizzavona J.

The reaction was terminated by heating samples at 75 °C for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry or/and by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. BACE1 or BACE2 activity in vitro was also assessed by cleavage of a FRET substrate encompassing P8-P4′ of the APPsw β site, TAMRA-5-CO-EEISEVNLDAEF-NH-QSY7, similar to the one described by Ermolieff et al. (21Ermolieff J. Loy J.A. Koelsch G. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12450-12456Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The reaction condition is the same as described above and the cleavage product was measured by a LJL Analyst AD instrument (LJL BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA) with excitation at 530 nm and emission at 580 nm. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Analysis of APP Processing Products—HEK293T cells stably expressing human APP695 were seeded in 100-mm dishes and transfected with either BACE1 or BACE2 DNA as described above. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Media were changed on the next day, and either Me2SO control or compound-1 was added to the new media. After an additional 24 h of incubation at 37° C, the media and cells were harvested. Aβ level in media was assayed by Origen system, as described previously, using biotinylated 6E10 antibody (Senetek, Maryland Heights, MO) and ruthenylated G2–10 antibody (16Li Y.-M. Lai M.-T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M. Shi X.-P. Yin K.-C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mass Spectrometric Analysis of BACE-cleaved Products—MALDI mass analysis was performed with a surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometer from Ciphergen Biosystems (Fremont, CA) and a Voyager DE/RP MALDI-TOF from Applied Biosystems. Typically, 1 μl of reaction mixture was mixed with 1 μl of a saturated MALDI matrix solution (α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid in 1:1 water/acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and was then spotted onto Ciphergen NP2 MALDI chips. After drying and crystal formation, sample spots were typically analyzed with 100 laser shots. In all figures containing MALDI mass spectrometric data, the generic notation Aβ X-X refers to the length of the Aβ fragment, such as Aβ 1– 40 or Aβ 1–34. This notation is used to denote the Aβ fragment corresponding to the mass of the singly charged peptide ion (M+H)+. In addition, in cases in which the doubly charged ion (M+2H)2+ is visible, as in Fig. 2, the generic notation (Aβ X-X + 2H)2+, denotes the Aβ species corresponding to the mass of the doubly charged peptide ion. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of APP Processing Products in Media— For analysis of APP processing species secreted into media, the collected media samples were immunoprecipitated with 6E10 antibody and protein G beads (Protein G UltraLink; Pierce Chemical). After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the supernatants were removed, and the immunoprecipitation beads were first washed three times with a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% Igepal CA630, pH 7.8, then washed twice with a buffer consisting of 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% Igepal CA630, pH 7.8, and finally washed three times with 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8. After the final wash, the captured products were eluted from the beads with a minimal volume of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. One microliter of the bead eluate was then spotted on to the an NP-2 SELDI sample target (Ciphergen Biosystems) or a stainless steel target for an ABI Voyager and allowed to air dry. The dried targets were placed into the SELDI-TOF and Voyager mass spectrometers and matrix/analyte coprecipitates were desorbed with N2 laser at 337 nm. The laser power was attenuated and the detector sensitivity manipulated such that spectra, which were the average of 100 laser shots, provided a qualitative assessment of the immunoprecipitation-captured cleavage products. BACE1 or BACE2, but Not Cathepsin D, Cleaves the Aβ-34 Site in Vitro—The activity of purified human full-length BACE1, BACE2, or cathepsin D, a closely related aspartyl protease, was tested for cleavage of a synthetic Aβ peptide 1– 40 in vitro. When BACE1 or BACE2 was incubated with a synthetic Aβ peptide 1-40 in vitro, a cleavage site located between Aβ residues 34 and 35 was clearly identified through mass spectrometric analysis as shown in Fig. 1, B1, B3, and B4. The theoretical mass value for Aβ 1–34 is 3786.9 and the observed mass values for the cleaved 1–34 products were 3785.6 and 3786.6 for BACE1 and BACE2, respectively. However, when Aβ 1– 40 peptide was incubated with cathepsin D, Aβ species cleaved at residues between 19 and 20 were observed by mass spectrometric analysis, but not the Aβ 1–34 product (Fig. 1B, 1 and 2). The absence of Aβ 1–34 species in cathepsin d-treated sample is not the result of a secondary cleavage of Aβ 1–34, because a shorter incubation time and with less enzyme showed similar results (data not shown). In contrast, both purified full-length human BACE1 (Fig. 1B, 3) and BACE2 (Fig. 1B, 4) processed the Aβ-34 site. Thus, the cleavage of Aβ-34 site is specific for BACE1 and BACE2 not for cathepsin D. BACE1 Lacking the Transmembrane and Cytoplasmic Regions Cleaves the Aβ-34 Site in Vitro—One of the major differences between BACE and cathepsin D is that cathepsin D does not contain a transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail. To investigate whether the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of BACE contribute to its specific activity of processing the Aβ-34 site, we tested the activities of truncated forms of BACE1 lacking both the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains using the Aβ 1– 40 substrate. Results from mass spectrometric analysis showed that truncated BACE1, both the pro-(amino acids 22– 460) and the mature (amino acids 46–460) forms (19Shi X.-P. Chen E. Yin K.-C. Na S. Garsky V.M. Lai M.-T. Li Y.-M. Platchek M. Register R.B. Sradana M. Tang M.-J. Thiebeau J. Wood T. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10366-10373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), cleaves the Aβ-34 site in vitro (Fig. 2). Therefore, the differential cleavage of Aβ-34 site between BACE and cathepsin D is probably because of the difference in their enzyme active sites. It is interesting to note that the truncated forms of BACE1 did not cleave the Aβ-20 site as seen with the full-length enzyme. BACE1 or BACE2 Does Not Cleave Aβ-34 Site Using CT99 as Substrate—To further investigate BACE in vitro cleavage specificity, we tested BACE activity using a recombinant CT99 protein substrate. CT99 or CT100 has been described previously as an efficient in vitro substrate for γ-secretase (16Li Y.-M. Lai M.-T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M. Shi X.-P. Yin K.-C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 17Li Y.-M. Xu M. Lai M.-T. Huang Q. Castro J. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M. Shearman M.K. Smith A.L. Shi X.-P. Yin K.-C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Control mass spectrometric analysis of CT99 alone (Fig. 3A) at mass range 1000–5000 Da did not show any notable species (Fig. 3B). To our surprise, when CT99 was incubated with BACE1, cleavage products of CT99 at either the Aβ-20 site or the Aβ-34 site were not observed (Fig. 3C). This was true for both full-length and truncated forms of BACE1 (data not shown). The absence of BACE1-mediated cleavage at Aβ-20 or Aβ-34 sites in CT99 was not caused by substrate depletion, because the substrate peak was still observed by mass spectrometry at the end of the reaction (data not shown), nor was it caused by enzyme inactivation, because that addition of a small peptide substrate encompassing the β-scissile bond at the end of the CT99 reaction yielded an appropriate cleavage product (data not shown). Likewise, BACE2 also did not cleave CT99 at the Aβ-34 site, although it cleaved at the Aβ-19 and -20 sites (Fig. 3D). Because the CT99 used here is in solution and not embedded in the membrane, the hydrophobic domain of the CT99 might be “abnormally” folded in the buffer. To test whether addition of a limited amount of detergent could expose the Aβ-34 site in CT99 for processing, the in vitro reaction with CT99 was also performed in the presence of 0.05% Triton X-100. Both BACE1 and BACE2 were fully functional in the presence of 0.05% Triton X-100 to cleave the β site of APP (data not shown) (3Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R. Davis D. Doan M. Dovey H.F. Frigon N. Hong J. Jacobson-Croak K. Jewett N. Keim P. Knops J. Lieberburg I. Power M. Tan H. Tatsuno G. Tung J. Schenk D. Seubert P. Suomensaari S.M. Wang S. Walker D. Zhao J. McConlogue L. John V. Nature. 1999; 402: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). However, neither of them showed any cleavage of Aβ-34 site in CT99 (data not shown). Therefore, unlike Aβ 1– 40 peptide, CT99 is not a substrate for Aβ-34 site cleavage by either BACE1 or BACE2 in vitro. Overexpression of BACE1 or BACE2 in Cells Increases Aβ 1–34 Production—To evaluate the effect of BACE1 or BACE2 on cellular Aβ 1–34 production, HEK293T cells stably expressing APP695 (HEK293T/APP695) were either mock transfected or transfected with BACE1 or BACE2 cDNA. Aβ 1– 40 level secreted in the media by these cells was determined by a modified ELISA assay using antibodies 6E10 and G2–10 (16Li Y.-M. Lai M.-T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M. Shi X.-P. Yin K.-C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) against Aβ 1– 40 (Fig. 4A). Consistent with previous reports, overexpression of BACE1 moderately increased the Aβ 1– 40 production (Fig. 4A, 2) (4Yan R. Bienkowski M.J. Shuck M.E. Miao H. Tory M.C. Pauley A.M. Brashler J.R. Stratman N.C. Mathews W.R. Buhl A.E. Carter D.B. Tomasselli A.G. Parodi L.A. Heinrikson R.L. Gurney M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar), and overexpression of BACE2 abolished the generation of Aβ 1– 40 (Fig. 4A, 3) (22Yan R. Munzner J.B. Shuck M.E. Bienkowski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34019-34027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). When the conditioned media were subjected to immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis (see “Materials and Methods”), results showed that HEK293T/APP695 cells produced few Aβ 1–34 species (Fig. 4B, 1); Transfection of BACE1 increased the relative amount of Aβ 1–34 species, in addition to Aβ 1–20 and Aβ 1– 40 (Fig. 4B, 2); transfection of BACE2 similarly increased Aβ 1–34 level, despite abolishing Aβ 1– 40 (Fig. 4B, 3). This suggests that in cells, BACE2 prefers Aβ-19, -20, or -34 sites over the Aβ-1 site. This result not only agrees well with BACE2 activity data in vitro (18Shi X.-P. Wu G.-X. Tugusheva K.

In summary, our results indicate that overexpression of BACE1 or BACE2 in cells increases the production of Aβ 1–34. γ-Secretase Inhibitors Block the Production of Aβ 1–34 in Cells—To evaluate the effect of γ-secretase inhibitors on the cellular production of Aβ 1–34 species, HEK293T/APP695 cells, either mock-transfected or transfected with BACE1 or BACE2, were treated with either Me2SO or with 10 μm concentrations of each of the two known γ-secretase inhibitors, compound 1 and compound 2 (24Seiffert D.

As expected, both compounds inhibited Aβ 1– 40 production in HEK293TAPP695 cells (Fig. 5A, 1–3) and the cells transfected with BACE1 (Fig. 5A, 4–6). The effect of compounds on the cellular production of Aβ 1– 40 was further confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of the Aβ species in the conditioned media of these cells (Fig. 5B). Notably, in BACE1 overexpressing cells, these γ-secretase inhibitors blocked the production of not only Aβ 1– 40 species but also Aβ 1–34 species (Fig. 5B, 4–6). Likewise, in BACE2 overexpressing cells, the increased generation of Aβ 1–34 species was also inhibited by these compounds (Fig. 5B, 7–9). In contrast, the generation of other Aβ species such as 1–16, 1–19, or 1–20 were largely unblocked (Fig. 5B). Inhibition of Aβ 1–34 Production by γ-Secretase Inhibitor Is Concentration-dependent and Coincides with the Blockade of Aβ 1– 40 Production—To further evaluate the effect of γ-secretase inhibitors on the cellular production of Aβ 1–34 species, another known γ-secretase inhibitor with a different structural class, compound 3 (17Li Y.-M.

In this work, we examined the phosphorylation of Opi1p by protein kinase C. Using a purified maltose-binding protein-Opi1p fusion protein as a substrate, protein kinase C activity was time- and dose-dependent, and dependent on the concentrations of Opi1p and ATP. Protein kinase C phosphorylated Opi1p on a serine residue. The Opi1p synthetic peptide GVLKQSCRQK, which contained a protein kinase C sequence motif at Ser26, was a substrate for protein kinase C. Phosphorylation of a purified S26A mutant maltose-binding protein-Opi1p fusion protein by the kinase was reduced when compared with the wild-type protein. A major phosphopeptide present in purified wild-type Opi1p was absent from the purified S26A mutant protein. In vivo labeling experiments showed that the phosphorylation of Opi1p was physiologically relevant, and that the extent of phosphorylation of the S26A mutant protein was reduced by 50% when compared with the wild-type protein. The physiological consequence of the phosphorylation of Opi1p at Ser26 was examined by measuring the effect of the S26A mutation on the expression of the phospholipid synthesis gene INO1.

Opi1p contains a leucine zipper and two glutamine-rich domains (13White M.J. Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These motifs, which are generally associated with DNA-binding proteins (13White M.J. Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are indispensable for Opi1p repressor function (14Wagner C. Blank M. Strohmann B. Schüller H.J. Yeast. 1999; 15: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Opi1p mediates its negative regulatory role through the UASINO element (15Bachhawat N. Ouyang Q. Henry S.A. J. Biol.

The mechanism of Opi1p activity is not yet fully understood. To gain further insight into the transcriptional regulation of phospholipid synthesis genes from S. cerevisiae, we initiated studies to examine the posttranslational modification of the Opi1p regulatory protein by phosphorylation via protein kinase C. Phosphorylation is a mechanism by which the function of a regulatory protein may be controlled (17Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 18Calkhoven C.F. Ab G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C is a transducer of lipid second messengers (19Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar, 20Nishizuka Y.

Cell. 1988; 52: 447-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that Opi1p was phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and that a major site of phosphorylation was Ser26. Moreover, a S26A mutant Opi1p protein caused reduced INO1 expression. Elimination of functional Opi1p by deletion of the OPI1 gene results in higher levels of INO1 expression, indicating that Opi1p functions as a negative regulator. Since a mutation reducing phosphorylation of Opi1p has an effect opposite of anopi1Δ mutation (i.e. reduction inINO1 expression versus deletion), we hypothesize that phosphorylation at Ser26 functions to inactivate Opi1p and attenuate its activity. All the chemicals were reagent-grade. Growth medium supplies were purchased from Difco Laboratories. Restriction endonucleases, modifying enzymes, recombinant Vent DNA polymerase, pMAL-c2 vector (25Maina C.V. Riggs P.D. Grandea III, A.G. Slatko B.E. Moran L.S. Tagliamonte J.A.

Mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (12CA5) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Purified rat brain protein kinase C was purchased from Promega. PKC1-encoded ZZ-tagged protein kinase C was partially purified from S. cerevisiae(26Yang W.-L. Bruno M.E.C. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

Protein A-Sepharose, polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the enhanced chemifluorescence Western blotting detection kit were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. PS and DG were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Cellulose thin layer sheets were from EM Science. Scintillation counting supplies and acrylamide solutions were purchased from National Diagnostics. Peptides GVLKQSCRQK, GVLKQACRQK, ILDRVSNKII, MSIESKKRLV, and ANKQLSDKIS were synthesized and purified commercially by Bio-Synthesis, Inc. The strains and plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in this work are listed in Tables Iand II, respectively. Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for the propagation of plasmids and the production of MBP-Opi1p fusion protein directed by the inducible pMAL-c2-OPI1 plasmids. Cells were grown in LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Ampicillin (150 µg/ml) was added to cultures of DH5α-carrying plasmids. For the production of MBP-Opi1p fusion proteins, cultures (250 ml) were grown to the exponential phase (A 600 nm = 0.4–0.6) at 37 °C, harvested, and resuspended in fresh medium containing 0.6 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. After incubation for 3 h at 30 °C, cells were harvested, washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 mNaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mmNa2EDTA, and then frozen at −70 °C. The induction was carried out at 30 °C to reduce the degradation of the fusion proteins. Methods for yeast growth were performed as described previously (27Rose M.D. Winston F. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar, 28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown in YEPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or in synthetic complete (SC) medium minus inositol (29Culbertson M.R. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1975; 80: 23-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 2% glucose at 30 °C. For selection of cells bearing plasmids, appropriate amino acids were omitted from SC medium. Cell numbers in liquid media were determined spectrophotometrically at an absorbance of 600 nm. Media were supplemented with 2% agar for growth on plates. An opi1Δ mutant was constructed in strain WCG4 (30Heinemeyer W. Gruhler A. Mohrle V. Mahe Y. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5115-5120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using anopi1Δ::kanMx deletion cassette. The kanMX module, flanked by OPI1 coding sequences, was amplified by PCR (primers: OPI-S1 and OPI-S2) using plasmid pFA6aKanMX4 (31Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar) as the template. The opi1Δ::kanMx deletion cassette was transformed into WCG4 to delete the chromosomal copy of theOPI1 gene by the one-step gene replacement technique (32Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on YEPD plates containing Geneticin (G418) (31Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). Deletion of the chromosomal copy of the OPI1 gene was confirmed by PCR (primers: OPI-A1 and OPI-A2) using genomic DNA isolated from the transformed colonies. One of the opi1Δ mutants that we isolated was designated strain SH1100. Thisopi1Δ mutant exhibited the inositol excretion phenotype that was characteristic of other opi1 mutants (12Greenberg M. Reiner B. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1982; 100: 19-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inositol excretion phenotype was examined on SC medium plates (minus inositol) by using growth of the inositol auxotrophic mutant strain MC13 (ino1) (29Culbertson M.R. Henry S.A.

In contrast to malignant transformation, the pattern of gene expression remains largely unmodified in telomerase-induced immortalization. Here we show evidence that suggests that the maintenance of a “young” pattern of gene expression by telomerization is mediated, at least in part, by a novel function of human telomerase that involves regulation of DNA methyltransferase I gene expression.

Here we show evidence that suggests that the maintenance of a “young” pattern of gene expression by telomerization is mediated, at least in part, by a novel function of human telomerase that involves regulation of DNA methyltransferase I gene expression. Primary cultures of normal human diploid cells have a limited proliferative lifespan (1Hayflick L. Moorhead P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 25: 585-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (5517) Google Scholar, 2Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 37: 614-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (4284) Google Scholar). After completing a finite number of divisions, the culture enters a state called replicative senescence that is characterized by a growth arrest refractory to further mitogenic stimulation and by altered gene expression (3Shelton D.N. Chang E. Whittier P.S. Choi D. Funk W.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 939-945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The introduction of the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT), 1The abbreviations used are: hTERT and hT, human telomerase; huLF, human embryonic lung fibroblast; SNRPN, small nuclear riboprotein-associated peptide N; DNAMeTase, DNA methyltransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; TRAP, telomerase repeat amplification protocol; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PD, population doubling. the enzyme that elongates telomere ends, into pre-senescent cells extends their proliferative lifespan (4Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that telomere attrition resulting from the incomplete replication of chromosome ends by DNA polymerase α triggers cellular senescence (5Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4625) Google Scholar). One of the most interesting aspects of lifespan extension by hTERT is that in addition to preventing irreversible growth arrest, it also prevents the changes in gene expression observed to occur during cellular aging (3Shelton D.N. Chang E. Whittier P.S. Choi D. Funk W.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 939-945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Additionally, there are no signs of transformation or changes in the differentiation state of the telomerized cultures (6Jiang X.R. Jimenez G. Chang E. Frolkis M. Kusler B. Sage M. Beeche M.

White M.A. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The pattern of gene expression of a particular cell type is determined mainly by chromatin architecture (the concerted pattern of cis-DNA sequences, DNA methylation, and nucleosomal protein modifications) and a particular set of transcription factors. Faithful heritability of gene expression patterns is critical to the maintenance of a particular differentiated state. Although the effects of hTERT re-expression in normal human fibroblasts have been regarded mostly as rejuvenation, the experimental evidence indicates that reactivation of telomerase most likely freezes the culture in its current state, possibly by fixing the pattern of gene expression. Here we investigated the mechanisms by which telomerase expression in fibroblasts maintains a fixed epigenomic state that prevents age-related changes in gene expression and senescence. Cells and Plasmids—The human foreskin fibroblast cell strains Wi38, HCA2, and ImR90 and their derivatives expressing the catalytic subunit of hTERT were a kind gift of J. Campisi (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA). The human embryonic lung fibroblast cell strains HuLF and HuLF-hTERT were established and cultured as described previously (8Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). pCMV-hTERT and pMet-CAT were kindly provided by R. A. Weinberg (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA) and M. Szyf (McGill University, Quebec, Canada), respectively. Determination of the 5mC Content—Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNAZol DNA extraction kit (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. RNA was removed by alkaline hydrolysis (0.5 m NaOH, 37 °C for 1 h). The 5mC content in DNA samples was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of enzymatic hydrolysates of DNA. 10 μg of DNA were digested at 37 °C for 3 h using 2 units of microccocal nuclease (United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH), 2 μg of spleen phosphodiesterase II (Roche Diagnostics) in 10 mm CaCl2, 20 mm sodium succinate, pH 6.0. The resulting 3′-deoxymonophosphate nucleosides were further hydrolyzed by overnight incubation at 37 °C with 20 units of alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were injected into a Beckman Ultrasphere ODS, 4.6 mm × 25 cm (5-μm particle size) column at room temperature programmed as follows: 100% buffer A (2% methanol in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 4.5) for 10 min, injection of the samples, and elution for 20 min in 100% buffer A followed by buffer B (9% methanol in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 4.5) over a 5-min linear gradient up to 100% buffer B for 10 min. High pressure liquid chromatography mobile phase was delivered to the column at 0.3 ml/min. Absorbance at 280 nm was recorded. The percent methylcytosine in the genome was determined as a ratio of the area of the 5mC peak to the total area of methylcytosine and cytosine residues in the sample. DNA Methyltransferase Activity—Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 0.1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% NaN3, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween 80, 60 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml RNase A. The cells were lysed by four cycles of freezing in dry ice-ethanol and thawed at 37 °C. Protein concentration of the supernatant after centrifugation of the cell lysates at 15,000 × g for 20 min was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). The enzyme activity was measured as described previously (9Adams R.L. McKay E.L. Craig L.M. Burdon R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 561: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. A 20-μl reaction mixture containing 5 μg of cell extract protein, 0.5 μg of a hemimethylated oligonucleotide duplex corresponding to the imprinted locus SNRPN (small nuclear riboprotein-associated peptide N), exon 1, and 3.3 μCi of S-adenosyl[methyl-3H]methionine (92 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 300 μl of a solution containing 1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 3% 4-aminosalicylate, 5% butanol, 125 mm NaCl, 0.25 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml proteinase K. After incubating for an additional 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamilic alcohol and was ethanol-precipitated. DNA was dissolved in 0.3 n NaOH and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. DNA was collected on a glass fiber filter disc, saturated with 1 mm non-labeled adenosylmethionine, and washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid followed by 70% ethanol. The filter was air-dried, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting in 5 ml of scintillation fluid. After subtracting background, the radioactivity incorporated into the DNA as a measure of DNA methyltransferase (DNAMeTase) activity was determined. Reactions were performed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. Oligonucleotides—2′-O-Methylphosphorothioate oligonucleotides were used in the antisense experiment: DNAMeTase antisense (MG88), 5′-AAGCATGAGCACCGTTCTCC-3′, and unrelated control oligonucleotide, 5′-ATACAACATGACAATAGATCG-3′ (boldface nucleotides are 2′-O-methyl-modified). The following oligonucleotides were used as substrate for the DNAMeTase activity determinations. The hemimethylated duplex was prepared by annealing equimolar amounts of SNRPN-methylated, 5′-CTTGCCMGCTCCATMGMGTCACTGACMGCTCCTCAGACAGATGMGTCAGGCATCTCMGGMGGCMGCTCCACTCTG-3′ (methylated single strand oligonucleotide), and SNRPN-unmethylated, 5′-CAGAGTGGAGCGGCCGCCGGAGATGCCTGACGCATCTGTCTGAGGAGCGGTCAGTGACGCGATGGAGCGGGCAAG-3′ (unmodified single strand oligonucleotide). The complementary oligonucleotides were incubated in annealing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm Na2EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl) at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 65 °C for 15 min and 37 °C for 15 min (10Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The full-length duplexes were purified on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, dissolved in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA), and stored at 20 °C. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern analysis was performed according to standard procedures. 32P-Labeled DNA probes for human DNMT1, p21, and actin mRNAs were prepared by random priming. Western Blot Analysis—Samples containing equal amounts of protein (20 μg) from cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nylon membrane. Proteins were detected by incubation with the indicated antibodies and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Transient Transfections—CMV-hTERT and pMet-CAT or p21-CAT were cotransfected into HCA2 cells (PD 19) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Transfection medium (0% fetal bovine serum) was replaced with 10% fetal bovine serum medium 3 h after plasmid delivery. All of the transfections were done in triplicate. 0.1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase was included as an internal control. 24 h after transfection, cells were collected and divided into two aliquots of 20 and 80% for protein and RNA extracts, respectively. Samples from the 80% aliquots were pooled for RNA preparation. Oligonucleotide Treatment—Cells (5 × 105) were electroporated on three sequential days (300 V, 960 microfarads) with a 100 nm concentration of the hybrid 2′-O-methylphosphorothioate DNAMeTase antisense or unrelated oligonucleotide in freshly made buffer (Cytomix) (120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 10 mm K2HPO4, 10 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm Hepes, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 5 mm glutathione, pH 7.6). After each electroporation, the cells were incubated in complete medium for 48 h in the presence of 40 nm oligonucleotide. 2.5 μg of CMV-hTERT were added to the last electroporation along with 0.1 μgof pCMV-β-galactosidase. Telomere Restriction Fragment Analysis—Mean telomere length was evaluated by using terminal restriction fragment analysis, a variation of standard Southern blotting. DNAs isolated from the different cell preparations were digested with a mixture of restriction enzymes and resolved on a 0.7% agarose gel (11Ouellette M.M. Liao M. Herbert B.S. Johnson M. Holt S.E.

The dried gel was hybridized with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (TTAGGG)3 exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and terminal restriction fragments were calculated as described in detail elsewhere (11Ouellette M.M.

Measurement of Telomerase Activity by Telomerase Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) Assay—The TRAP assay was performed using the TRAP-EZE kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY) as indicated by the manufacturers. Telomerase-induced Lifespan Extension Prevents the Decrease in DNA Methyltransferase Activity Normally Seen upon Serial Subcultivation—It has been suggested that decreasing DNA methylation level plays a role in cellular aging (12Holliday R. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 166: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13Holliday R. Stem Cell Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Thus, we measured DNA methylation levels known to decrease during in vitro cellular aging of normal human fibroblasts (14Wilson V.L. Jones P.A. Science. 1983; 220: 1055-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 15Hoal-van Helden E.G. van Helden P.D. Mutat. Res. 1989; 219: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Young J.I. Smith J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19610-19616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We examined normal control cells (HCA2) and cells that had been immortalized by introduction of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (HCA2-hT). The DNA methylation level of control cultures decreases as the cultures age. However, telomerized cells maintained constant levels of global DNA methylation throughout their extended lifespan (Fig. 1). The observed halt in the decrease in methylation levels suggests the possibility that the methylcytosine content of normal fibroblasts reaches an equilibrium point and “bottoms out” at or shortly prior to senescence. This would not be apparent under normal circumstances because the cells stop dividing and are only revealed when the cells are allowed to bypass the senescent arrest by acquiring telomerase activity. However, the level of DNA methylation exhibited by telomerized cultures was similar to the level in the cultures just before hTERT introduction (Fig. 1, at PD 25, white bars, or at PD 45, black bars), favoring an active maintenance of DNA methylation at “young” levels. Because the age-related decrease in DNA methylation levels is at least partially a consequence of a reduction in DNAMeTase activity (16Young J.I. Smith J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19610-19616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Vertino P.M. Issa J.P. Pereira-Smith O.M. Baylin S.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1395-1402PubMed Google Scholar), we analyzed the DNAMeTase activity of different telomerized cell cultures. Interestingly, we observed a transient increase in DNAMeTase activity shortly after telomerization (Fig. 2) that lasted only a few population doublings. Nevertheless, after decreasing to normal levels, the DNAMeTase activity was stabilized at a relatively constant level, whereas non-telomerized control cells exhibited a decline with increasing PD (Fig. 2). This telomerization-dependent maintenance of DNAMeTase was observed in three independent fibroblast cultures including HCA2, ImR90, and HuLF that have been telomerized at different population-doubling levels. However, telomerized Wi38 cells did not exhibit this effect. Notably, in this particular culture of telomerized Wi38 cells, telomerase activity is very low compared with the other telomerized cell cultures. In addition, the determination of telomere length in the same Wi38-hT cells at different PD indicated that telomere attrition persisted in these cells even after telomerization and apparent immortalization (data not shown). Thus, we suggest that the maintenance of DNAMeTase activity as a consequence of hTERT expression may stabilize DNA methylation levels. Expression of Telomerase Stimulates the DNMT1 Promoter—To test whether DNA methyltransferase is regulated at the transcriptional level by telomerase, we examined the expression of a mouse DNMT1 promoter construct (18Rouleau J. MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1595-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) in normal human fibroblast cells in the presence and absence of telomerase expression. Fig. 3B shows that transient transfection of the mouse DNMT1 promoter and CMV-hTERT (a construct shown previously to express telomerase activity (Fig. 3A) (19Counter C.M. Hahn W.C. Wei W. Caddle S.D. Beijersbergen R.L. Lansdorp P.M. Sedivy J.M. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14723-14728Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) in normal hTERT-negative HCA2 cells stimulated the promoter in a dose-dependent manner. The observed hTERT induction of expression of the mouse promoter suggested that telomerase might also activate the endogenous DNMT1 promoter, as mouse and human somatic cells seem to regulate the expression of DNMT1 similarly. To test this possibility, we measured DNMT1 mRNA levels and DNAMeTase activity in HCA2 cells transiently transfected with a CMV-hTERT construct. Northern blot analysis indicated that endogenous DNMT1 mRNA was also up-regulated in the hTERT-transfected cells compared with cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 3C). Moreover, DNMT1 activity was also increased in the transfected cells compared with control cells (data not shown). These data together indicated that telomerase reactivation modified the steady state levels of DNMT1 mRNA by transcriptional activation. Telomerization Blocks the Age-related Increase in p21—It has been suggested that telomerase expression suppresses the senescence-associated induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (7Morales C.P. Holt S.E. Ouellette M. Kaur K.J. Yan Y. Wilson K.S. White M.A. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), one of the main effectors of cellular senescence. In addition, the inhibition of DNMT1 results in increased transcription from a p21 promoter/reporter construct (20Milutinovic S. Knox J.D. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6353-6359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and from the endogenous p21 promoter (16Young J.I. Smith J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19610-19616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which probably accounts for the reported tumor-suppressive effects of decreased DNMT1 expression (21MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8037-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 22Ramchandani S. MacLeod A.R. Pinard M. von Hofe E. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Because p21 mRNA and protein are significantly increased as fibroblasts enter senescence (23Wei S. Sedivy J.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1539-1543PubMed Google Scholar), we determined whether p21 mRNA and protein levels in high passage telomerized cultures were maintained at the level found in young cells. Western analysis indicated that p21 protein (in all of the cultures analyzed) was maintained at levels exhibited by the cultures just prior to introduction of telomerase (at PD 45) (Fig. 4, A and B). However, a marked increase in p21 levels was observed in cultures at confluence (Fig. 4C), indicating that the ability of telomerized cells to respond to stress by up-regulation of p21 was still intact. In agreement with the protein content, hTERT-immortalized cells displayed p21 steady state mRNA levels comparable with the young proliferating parental cells (Fig. 4D). p21 Promoter Activity Is Repressed by Telomerase Expression—We next analyzed the effect of transient transfection of hTERT on endogenous p21 levels. Northern blot analysis indicated that endogenous p21 mRNA levels were slightly decreased in hTERT transiently transfected cells, suggesting that the increase in DNMT1 (Fig. 3D) could repress the p21 endogenous promoter. However, the regulation of p21 levels had also been shown to be dependent on stabilization of mRNA (24Giles K.M. Daly J.M. Beveridge D.J. Thomson A.M. Voon D.C. Furneaux H.M. Jazayeri J.A. Leedman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2937-2946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To identify the mechanism of telomerase-induced prevention of p21 up-regulation in response to repeated cell division, we analyzed the effects of transiently co-transfecting hTERT along with a p21 reporter construct (25Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of hTERT resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of expression from the p21 promoter, confirming the transcriptional control of p21 expression by hTERT (Fig. 5). Co-transfection of 1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase did not affect p21 promoter activity as normalized by protein content (data not shown), eliminating the possibility of promoter competition. To further elucidate the pathway by which expression of hTERT results in repression of the p21 promoter, we tested the effects of transient transfection of DNMT1 antisense (or an unrelated control) oligonucleotides along with hTERT (or pGL3-control vector) on the expression of the p21-luciferase construct. Expression of hTERT did not reverse the activation of the p21 promoter by antisense inhibition of DNMT1 (data not shown). This indicates that the inhibition of p21 by DNMT1 is downstream of the direct effect of hTERT. The data of this study together suggest that the hTERT-dependent prevention of the age-related decrease in DNMT1 expression could participate in the maintenance of a young phenotype in two ways: first, by freezing the epigenomic state of young proliferating cells by the stabilization of DNA methylation and, second, by maintaining low levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p21, mediated at least partially by DNMT1's transcriptional repressor activity. The data are consistent with a model in which both modification of telomere dynamics and DNMT1 up-regulation are components of the output pathway leading from telomerase reactivation to indefinite replicative capacity (Fig. 6). In this model, telomerase introduction counteracts telomere attrition, preventing the cellular response to telomere shortening (cellular senescence), and also regulates the expression of DNMT1. It is not clear yet whether telomerase regulation of DNMT1 is via a direct effect of the telomerase protein or whether it is mediated by its telomerase activity. Damm et al. (26Damm K. Hemmann U. Garin-Chesa P. Hauel N. Kauffmann I. Priepke H. Niestroj C. Daiber C. Enenkel B. Guilliard B. Lauritsch I. Muller E. Pascolo E. Sauter G. Pantic M. Martens U.M. Wenz C. Lingner J. Kraut N. Rettig W.J. Schnapp A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6958-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) reported that pharmacological inhibition of telomerase processivity produced down-regulation of DNMT1 (and up-regulation of p21), favoring the latter hypothesis. However, in the same study, a 5-fold reduction of hTERT mRNA was also observed, precluding a definitive resolution of this issue. The age-related increase in p21 is blocked by complementary pathways, one involving the elimination of the positive signal coming from short telomeres and another involving a negative signal coming from the DNMT1-repressive activity. DNMT1 in turn also has another role in the maintenance of a young proliferative state, which is to preserve the pattern of DNA methylation. In conjunction, these processes participate in the maintenance of an indefinite proliferative potential. Our data suggest the existence of previously unknown functions of hTERT, namely, the activation of the DNMT1 promoter and maintenance of DNMT1 activity during serial subcultivation of normal human fibroblasts. The mechanism by which this occurs has yet to be determined. However, one consequence of this function of hTERT appears to be the prevention of changes in gene expression related to cellular aging. The finding that normal cells that have been subjected to telomerase-induced lifespan extension maintains an epigenomic state that resembles the pre-immortalization state increases the possibility of using such cells in therapeutic processes. The reports of oncogenic effects of increased DNMT1 expression (27Bakin A.V. Curran T. Science. 1999; 283: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 28Slack A. Cervoni N. Pinard M. Szyf M.

Bioengin. 1999; 88: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Under ordinary circumstances, however, adaptive maturation of the catalytic activity may not be a favored event. B cell clonal selection occurs by sequence diversification of genes encoding the Ab variable domains followed by selective binding of the antigen to cell surface Abs with the greatest affinity, which drives proliferation of the B cells (5Nossal G.J. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 185: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Catalysis entails chemical transformation of the antigen and release of products from the Ab, which may cause cessation of B cell proliferation when the catalytic rate exceeds the rate of transmembrane signaling necessary to stimulate cell proliferation. Originally developed as irreversible inhibitors of conventional serine proteases, haptenic phosphonate esters are reported to bind the nucleophilic sites of natural proteolytic Abs covalently (6Paul S. Tramontano A. Gololobov G. Zhou Y.X. Taguchi H. Karle S. Nishiyama Y. Planque S. George S. J. Biol.

The haptenic phosphonates could potentially serve as covalently reactive analogs (CRAs) for inducing the synthesis of Abs with improved nucleophilicity. To the extent that Ab nucleophilicity is rate-limiting in proteolysis, its enhancement may permit more rapid peptide bond cleavage, i.e. if the subsequent steps in the catalytic reaction cycle (hydrolysis of the acyl-Ab complex and product release) do not pose significant energetic hurdles (see Fig. 1). The innate character of Ab nucleophilic reactivity is the central element of this approach, and there is no requirement for de novo formation of chemically reactive sites over the course of variable domain sequence diversification. Most previous attempts to program the structure of catalytic sites in Abs in comparison have relied on noncovalent stabilization of the oxyanionic transition state (i.e. by immunization with transition state analogs; Refs. 8Tramontano A.

Science. 1994; 265: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) utilize covalent catalytic mechanisms, but the relationship of these activities to innate Ab nucleophilicity is unclear. An ideal antigen-specific proteolytic Ab may be conceived to combine traditional noncovalent binding interactions in the ground state of the Ab-antigen complex with nucleophilic attack on the peptide backbone. The ground state interactions are desirable to obtain specificity for individual polypeptide antigens. No impediments for catalysis are presented by the stable ground state complexes, provided the noncovalent interactions are carried over into the transition state complex and are properly coordinated with nucleophilic attack at the reaction center. In theory, synthesis of antigen-specific proteolytic Abs could be induced by an analog that presents a mimetic of the chemical reaction center in the context of classical antigenic epitopes available for noncovalent binding interactions. If the reaction proceeds by a lock-and-key stereochemical mechanism, the mimetic must be located precisely at the position of the intended scissile bond in the backbone of the polypeptide antigen. In the instance of large proteins, locating the mimetic within the protein backbone is outside the range of present-day synthetic technologies. A potential solution is to place the mimetic group at amino acid side chains using chemical linker techniques. An Ab nucleophile that recognizes the side chain mimetic could facilitate proteolysis if it enjoys sufficient conformational freedom to approach the polypeptide backbone of the substrate and form the acyl-Ab complex (see Fig. 1). We describe here the characteristics of Abs induced by a CRA of the HIV-1 coat protein gp120 (gp120-CRA) consisting of phosphonate diester groups located in Lys side chains of the protein. Enhanced serine protease-like nucleophilic reactivity of the Abs was observed. One monoclonal Ab cleaved gp120 slowly and specifically, it displayed preference for cleavage on the C-terminal side of Lys/Arg residues, and the catalytic reaction was susceptible to CRA inhibition. These findings are the first indications that Abs with proteolytic activity specific for individual proteins can be raised on demand. Hapten, gp120-CRAs, and Biotinylated Proteins—Synthesis of hapten CRAs I and II (see Fig. 1) and their characterization by electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy and elemental analyses have been described previously (12Nishiyama Y.

For preparation of gp120-CRA III, the precursor diphenyl-N-[O-(3-sulfosuccinimidyl)suberoyl]amino(4amidinophenyl)methanephosphonate (IV) was synthesized by mixing a solution of diphenylamino(4-amidinophenyl)methanephosphonate (79 mg, 0.13 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (2 ml) containing N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.11 ml, 0.63 mmol) and bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate disodium salt (150 mg, 0.26 mmol; Pierce) for 2 h. IV was obtained by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (12Nishiyama Y. Taguchi H. Luo J.Q. Zhou Y.X. Burr G. Karle S. Paul S. Arch. Biochem.

IV (1.1 mg) was reacted with electrophoretically pure gp120 (0.5 mg; Immunodiagnostic Inc., MN strain, purified from baculovirus expression system) in 5 ml of 10 mm HEPES, 25 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CHAPS, pH 7.5 buffer (2 h, 25 °C). Excess IV was removed by gel filtration (Micro Bio-Spin 6 disposable column, Bio-Rad), and the concentration of free amines in the initial protein and CRA-derivitized protein was measured using fluorescamine (13Udenfriend S. Stein S. Bohlen P. Dairman W. Leimgruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). The density of labeling was varied as needed from 4.0 to 32.6 mol of CRA/mol of gp120 by varying the concentration of IV. Preparation of gp120 labeled at Lys residues with biotin (Bt-gp120) was by similar means using 6-biotinamidohexanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma). The reaction time and reactant concentrations were controlled to yield biotin/gp120 molar ratios 0.8–1.9. Unreacted biotinylation reagent was removed using a disposable gel filtration column in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm glycine, 0.1 mm CHAPS, pH 7.8. The biotin content was determined using 2-(4′-hydroxyazobenzene)benzoic acid (14Green N.M. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 23-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total protein measurements were done using the BCA method (Pierce kit). Biotinylated III was prepared from Bt-gp120 as described for III. With increasing incorporation of the hapten groups, biotinylated III tended to form dimers and trimers evident in SDS electrophoresis gels as bands at ∼ 240 and 380 kDa (nominal mass of monomer gp120, 120 kDa). Biotinylated III at hapten density similar to the non-biotinylated III employed as immunogen (23 mol/mol of gp120) contained the monomer, dimer, and trimer species at proportions of 50, 21, and 29%, respectively. Protein-CRAs were lyophilized and stored at -20 °C until used. Bt-gp120 was stored at -70 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m glycine, 0.1 mm CHAPS. Storage of I and II was at -70 °C as 10 mm solutions in N,N-dimethylformamide. The extracellular domain of EGFR (exEGFR) obtained from Dr. Maureen O'Connor (15Brown P.M. Debanne M.T. Grothe S. Bergsma D. Caron M. Kay C. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was biotinylated as described for gp120 (0.9 mol of biotin/mol of exEGFR). Antibodies—mAbs were prepared from female MRL/MpJ-Faslpr mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME; 4–5 weeks) immunized with gp120-CRA III (23 mol of phosphonate diester/mol of gp120). The mice were injected intraperitoneally on days 0, 14, and 28 days with gp120-CRA III (11 μg) in Ribi adjuvant (monophosphoryl lipid A + trehalose dicorynomycolate emulsion; Sigma) followed by a fourth intravenous booster without adjuvant on day 55. Blood was obtained from the retroorbital plexus over the course of the immunization schedule. Three days after the final injection, hybridomas were prepared by fusion of splenocytes with myeloma cell line (NS-1; Ref. 3Paul S. Sun M. Mody R. Tewary H.K. Stemmer P. Massey R.J. Gianferrara T.

After identification of wells secreting the desired Abs by ELISA, monoclonal cell lines were prepared by two rounds of cloning by limiting dilution. Monoclonal IgG was prepared from tissue culture supernatants containing mAbs (200 ml) by affinity chromatography on immobilized protein G (3Paul S. Sun M. Mody R. Tewary H.K. Stemmer P. Massey R.J.

Control mAbs (anti-VIP clone c23.5 and anti-yellow fever virus antigen clone CRL 1689; ATCC) and serum IgG were purified similarly. The IgG preparations were electrophoretically homogeneous, determined by silver staining of overloaded IgG and immunoblotting with specific Abs to mouse IgG (3Paul S. Sun M. Mody R. Tewary H.K. Stemmer P. Massey R.J. Gianferrara T. Mehrotra S. Dreyer T. Meldal M. Tramontano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13142-13145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional immunizations of female BALB/c mice (Jackson; 4–5 weeks) with gp120 or gp120-CRA were carried out similarly. mAb heavy and light chain isotypes were determined by ELISA as described (3Paul S. Sun M. Mody R. Tewary H.K. Stemmer P. Massey R.J. Gianferrara T. Mehrotra S. Dreyer T. Meldal M. Tramontano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13142-13145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ELISA—Maxisorp 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated with gp120 or gp120-CRA (40–100 ng/well) in 100 mm bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.6. Routine ELISAs were carried out as described (16Karle S. Nishiyama Y. Zhou Y.X. Luo J. Planque S. Hanson C. Paul S. Vaccine. 2003; 21: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For assay of irreversible binding, the Abs were allowed to bind the plates, and the wells were treated for 30 min with 2% SDS in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4 (PBS-Tween) or PBS-Tween without SDS (control wells for measurement of total binding). The wells were then washed three times with PBS-Tween, and bound IgG was determined as usual using a peroxidase conjugate of goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific; Sigma). Observed values of binding were corrected for nonspecific binding in wells containing nonimmune IgG or nonimmune mouse serum (A490 < 0.03). Percent residual binding in SDS-treated wells was computed as (A490, SDS-treated wells) × 100/(A490, PBS-Tween-treated wells). Electrophoresis of Ab-CRA Complexes—Irreversible binding of biotinylated CRAs by purified IgG was determined by denaturing electrophoresis (6Paul S. Tramontano A. Gololobov G. Zhou Y.X. Taguchi H. Karle S. Nishiyama Y. Planque S. George S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28314-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m glycine, pH 8.0. SDS was added to 2%, and the mixtures were boiled (5 min) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (4–20%, Bio-Rad, or 8–25% Phast gels, Amersham Biosciences). After electro-blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.22 μm, Bio-Rad), the membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS-Tween and processed for detection of IgG or biotin using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) or peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, respectively. Imaging and quantification were using x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with Unscan-it software (Silk scientific, Orem, UT) or a Fluoro-STM MultiImager (Bio-Rad). Biotinylated bovine serum albumin (11 mol of biotin/mol of bovine serum albumin; Sigma) was employed to construct a standard curve (0.06–1.5 pmol of biotin/lane). Hydrolysis Assays—Biotinylated proteins were incubated with IgG in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m glycine, 0.1 mm CHAPS, pH 8, at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by addition of SDS to 2%, and the samples were boiled (5 min) and then analyzed by reducing SDS-gel electrophoresis (4–20%, Bio-Rad). Biotin containing protein bands in blots of the gel were identified and quantified as in the preceding section. In some blots, reaction products were identified by immunoblotting using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-gp120 Abs (Fitzgerald, Concord, MA; catalog #60-H14) (16Karle S. Nishiyama Y. Zhou Y.X. Luo J. Planque S. Hanson C. Paul S. Vaccine. 2003; 21: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of protein bands from electrophoresis gels was done as described previously (17Sun M. Gao Q.S. Kirnarskiy L. Rees A. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of peptide-MCA substrates (Peptide International, Louisville, KY or Bachem Biosciences, King of Prussia, PA) was determined in 96-well plates by fluorimetric detection of aminomethylcoumarin (Varian Cary Eclipse; λex 360 nm, λem 470 nm) with authentic aminomethylcoumarin as standard (6Paul S. Tramontano A. Gololobov G. Zhou Y.X. Taguchi H. Karle S. Nishiyama Y. Planque S. George S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28314-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cleavage of [Tyr10-125I]VIP by mAb c23.5 was measured as the radioactivity rendered soluble in trichloroacetic acid (17Sun M. Gao Q.S. Kirnarskiy L. Rees A. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters for cleavage of increasing concentrations of peptide-MCA substrates were determined from the Michaelis-Menten equation, v = (Vmax[S])/(Km + [S]). Because of the expense of studying gp120 cleavage at large concentrations of the protein, Kd (∼Km) and kcat for this reaction were obtained from the general quadratic equation (17Sun M. Gao Q.S. Kirnarskiy L. Rees A. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) [CS]2 - [CS] ([Ct] + [St] + Kd) + [Ct] [SCt] = 0, where [Ct] and [St] are the total concentrations of catalyst and substrate, and [CS] is the catalyst-substrate concentration. The method consists of calculation of [CS] at a series of assumed Kd values. The assumed Kd value yielding the best fit (by linear regression) between the observed reaction velocity and [CS] represents the experimentally determined Kd. kcat is computed as the slope of the observed velocity versus [CS] plot. gp120-CRA Design and Validation—Synthesis of hapten CRAs I and II (Fig. 1) and their covalent reactivity with naturally occurring proteolytic Abs has been described previously (6Paul S. Tramontano A. Gololobov G. Zhou Y.X. Taguchi H. Karle S. Nishiyama Y. Planque S. George S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28314-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Taguchi H. Burr G. Karle S. Planque S. Zhou Y.X. Paul S. Nishiyama Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 3167-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The electrophilic phosphonate mimics the peptide bond carbonyl group susceptible to nucleophilic attack, the positively charged amidino group adjacent to the phosphonate diester serves as a mimic of Lys/Arg P1 residues at which cleavage by germ line-encoded proteolytic Abs is observed (6Paul S. Tramontano A. Gololobov G. Zhou Y.X. Taguchi H. Karle S. Nishiyama Y. Planque S. George S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28314-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the biotin group in I permits sensitive detection of Ab-phosphonate adducts. gp120-CRA III contains phosphonate diester groups in spatial proximity with antigenic epitopes presented by the protein. Multiple phosphonate diester groups were available per molecule of gp120, allowing presentation of the electrophilic hapten in conjunction with diverse antigenic epitopes. Robust polyclonal Ab responses in MRL/lpr and BALB/c mice immunized with III were observed by routine ELISA. Abs raised to III were bound at somewhat greater levels by immobilized III than control gp120 devoid of phosphonate diester groups (Fig. 2). Conversely, Abs raised to control gp120 recognized immobilized III, but the binding was 3–4-fold lower than by immobilized gp120 (e.g. at serum dilution of 1:1000, A490 0.44 ± 0.03 for immobilized III and 1.40 ± 0.03 for immobilized gp120). III binding by nonimmune Abs was negligible, indicating that indiscriminate covalent binding at the hapten groups was not a problem. The observed differences in the antigenic reactivity of gp120 and III were held to be sufficiently small to proceed with further Ab studies. To facilitate high throughput screening, the feasibility of measuring irreversible III binding by Abs was studied by ELISA. After binding of polyclonal Abs anti-III Abs to the immobilized antigens, ELISA plates were treated with the denaturant SDS to remove reversibly bound Abs. SDS treatment allowed essentially complete removal of anti-III Abs bound by control gp120 devoid of hapten phosphonate groups. In comparison, 13–40% of the overall anti-III Ab binding activity consistently remained bound to immobilized III after SDS treatment in three repeat experiments. SDS-electrophoresis and immunoblotting with Abs to mouse IgG confirmed formation of irreversible Ab-III complexes in boiled reaction mixtures (Fig. 2B, inset, lane 3, estimated mass from extrapolated standard curve of molecular mass standards, ∼400 kDa; large complexes can be formed by binding of multiple Abs to hapten groups in III). Catalytic Activity—mAbs were prepared from MRL/lpr mice immunized with gp120-CRA III. This mouse strain develops lupus-like autoimmune disease attributable to the dysfunctional Fas-receptor gene. Spontaneous development of proteolytic Abs (18Bangale Y. Karle S. Zhou Y.X. Lan L. Kalaga R. Paul S. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and increased synthesis of esterase Abs in response to immunization with phosphonate monoester haptens (19Tawfik D.S. Chap R. Green B.S. Sela M. Eshhar Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Sun J. Takahashi N. Kakinuma H. Nishi Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5775-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) have been reported in this mouse strain. Supernatants from 712 hybridoma wells (two splenocyte-myeloma cell fusions) were screened for SDS-resistant binding to III. IgG from seven wells was positive for this activity. After cloning of the cells by limiting dilution, monoclonal IgG from the supernatants of the seven cell lines was purified, and the binding assays were repeated (Fig. 3; clones YZ18, IgG2a,κ; YZ19, IgG2b,κ; YZ20, IgG2a,κ; YZ21, IgG2a,κ; YZ22, IgG2a,κ; YZ23, IgG2a,κ, and YZ24, IgG1,κ). Of total binding observed without SDS treatment of the ELISA plates, residual binding after the detergent treatment was 43–83% in 4 repeat assays. All seven mAbs were also bound by gp120 devoid of hapten CRA groups determined by routine ELISA without SDS treatment, indicating that they are not directed to neoepitopes generated by chemical modification procedures used for III preparation. An irrelevant mAb (clone CRL 1689) displayed no detectable binding of III or gp120. Of seven mAbs with irreversible III binding activity, slow cleavage of Bt-gp120 by three mAbs was detected (YZ18, YZ20, YZ24), determined by the appearance of biotin-containing fragments of the protein in SDS-electrophoresis gels. The electrophoretic pattern of Bt-gp120 cleaved by mAbs YZ18 and YZ24 were similar to that shown for mAb YZ20 in Fig. 4. mAb YZ20 was further studied as it cleaved Bt-gp120 ∼5-fold more rapidly than the other two mAbs. The consumption of gp120 was time-dependent (Fig. 4A). Major biotin-containing cleavage products with apparent mass 55 and 50 kDa were observed along with less intensely stained bands at 27 and 15 kDa. A band at 35 kDa was visible in overexposed gels, but this does not represent a product of mAb cleavage, as it was present at similar density in control incubations of Bt-gp120 in diluent. A control-irrelevant mAb (clone CRL 1689) did not cleave Bt-gp120. Immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-gp120 Abs confirmed that non-biotinylated gp120 is also susceptible to cleavage by the mAb (55-kDa cleavage product, Fig. 4B). Both detection methods allow quantification of gp120 cleavage by measuring depletion of intact gp120. Neither method provides guidance about the complete product profile or product concentration, because Bt-gp120 contains minimal amounts of biotin (∼1 mol/molgp120), and the polyclonal Abs used for immunoblotting do not react equivalently with the cleavage products. mAb YZ20 did not cleave biotinylated bovine serum albumin or the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor (exEGFR), indicating selectivity for gp120 (Fig. 5A). Attempts to identify the bonds cleaved by mAb YZ20 were unsuccessful. N-terminal sequencing of the 55- and 50-kDa bands yielded identical sequences (TEKLWVTVYY), corresponding to the N-terminal residues of gp120. Sequencing of the 15-kDa band from the YZ20 reaction mixture did not yield detectable phenylthiohydantoin derivatives of amino acids, possibly because of a blocked N terminus. Identification of the 27-kDa gp120 fragment is complicated because of its comigration with the Ab light chain in reducing gels. Because identification of the precise bonds in gp120 cleaved by the mAb was not central to the present study, we turned to the use of model peptide substrates for determination of scissile bond preferences. A fluorimetric assay was employed to determine mAb-catalyzed cleavage of the amide bond linking aminomethylcoumarin to the C-terminal amino acid in a panel of peptide-MCA substrates (Fig. 5B). The peptide-MCA substrates were used at excess concentration (200 μm), permitting detection of even weakly cross-reactive catalytic Abs. Selective cleavage at Arg-MCA and Lys-MCA was observed, with no evident cleavage on the C-terminal side of neutral or acidic residues. To confirm that the rate differences are because of recognition of the basic residue at the cleavage site (as opposed to remote residues), we studied two tripeptide substrates identical in sequence except for the N-terminal residue at the scissile bond, Gly-Gly-Arg-MCA and Gly-Gly-Leu-MCA. The former substrate was cleaved at detectable levels by Ab YZ20 (0.31 ± 0.01 (S.D.) μm aminomethylcoumarin/19 h/μm IgG), whereas the fluorescence intensity in reaction mixtures of the latter substrate and the Ab was statistically indistinguishable from background values observed in assay diluent (0.02 ± 0.04 μm MCA/19 h/μm IgG; p > 0.05; student's t test, unpaired; Fig. 5C). The basic residue preference is consistent with the presence of positively charged amidino groups neighboring the phosphonate groups in the immunogen (III) and selective cleavage on the C-terminal side of Arg/Lys residues by germ line-encoded proteolytic Abs observed previously (21Kalaga R. Li L. O'Dell J.R. Paul S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2695-2702PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gololobov G. Sun M. Paul S. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Attainment of the desired catalytic properties, i.e. the ability to combine high affinity for individual antigens with rapid turnover, can be judged from the Km and kcat parameters (mol of antigen cleaved/mol of Ab/unit time). The Km of mAb YZ20 for Bt-gp120 was about 200-fold smaller than its preferred peptide-MCA substrate (EAR-MCA; Table I; single letter"
https://openalex.org/W2135771284,"The gene for the mismatch-specific uracil glycosylase (MUG) was identified in the Escherichia coli genome as a sequence homolog of the mammalian thymine DNA glycosylase, with activity against uracil in U.G mismatches. Subsequently, 3,N4-ethenocytosine (epsilonC), thymine, 5-hydroxymethyluracil, and 8-(hydroxymethyl)-3,N4-ethenocytosine have been proposed as possible substrates for this enzyme. The evaluation of various DNA adducts as substrates is complicated by the biphasic nature of the kinetics of this enzyme. Our results demonstrate that product release by the enzyme is very slow and hence comparing the steady-state parameters of the enzyme for different substrates is of limited use. Consequently, the ability of the enzyme to excise a variety of damage products of purines and pyrimidines was studied under single turnover conditions. Although the enzyme excised both epsilonC and U from DNA, the former adduct was significantly better as a substrate in terms of binding and hydrolysis. Some products of oxidative and alkylation damage are also moderately good substrates for the enzyme, but thymine is a poor substrate. This comparison of different substrates under single turnover conditions provides a rational basis for comparing substrates of MUG and we relate these conclusions to the known crystal structures of the enzyme and its catalytic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2058070020,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 and parathyroid hormone (PTH) are potent inducers of osteoclast (OCL) formation, and PTH increases FGF-2 mRNA and protein expression in osteoblasts. To elucidate the role of endogenous FGF-2 in PTH responses, we examined PTH-induced OCL formation in bone marrow cultures from wild type and mice with a disruption of the Fgf2 gene. FGF-2-induced OCL formation was similar in marrow culture from both genotypes. In contrast, PTH-stimulated OCL formation in bone marrow cultures or co-cultures of osteoblast-spleen cells from Fgf2-/mice was significantly impaired. PTH increased RANKL mRNA expression in osteoblasts cultures from both genotypes. After 6 days of treatment, osteoprotegerin protein in cell supernatants was 40-fold higher in vehicle-treated and 30-fold higher in PTH-treated co-cultures of osteoblast and spleen cells from Fgf2-/mice compared with Fgf2+/+ mice. However, a neutralizing antibody to osteoprotegerin did not rescue reduced OCL formation in response to PTH. Injection of PTH caused hypercalcemia in Fgf2+/+ but not Fgf2-/mice. We conclude that PTH stimulates OCL formation and bone resorption in mice in part by endogenous FGF-2 synthesis by osteoblasts. Because RANKL- and interleukin-11-induced OCL formation was also reduced in bone marrow cultures from Fgf2-/mice, we further conclude that endogenous FGF-2 is necessary for maximal OCL formation by multiple bone resorbing factors. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 and parathyroid hormone (PTH) are potent inducers of osteoclast (OCL) formation, and PTH increases FGF-2 mRNA and protein expression in osteoblasts. To elucidate the role of endogenous FGF-2 in PTH responses, we examined PTH-induced OCL formation in bone marrow cultures from wild type and mice with a disruption of the Fgf2 gene.

Bone is a complex organ that has multiple functions in the body. It provides a structural framework, is a storehouse for calcium, and is the site of hematopoiesis. To maintain these functions, bone constantly remodels. Bone resorption is accomplished by osteoclasts, which remove bone, whereas osteoblasts are the cells that form bone (1Rodan G.A. Martin T.J.

Osteoclasts are multinucleated giant cells that are capable of removing both the mineral and organic component of bone (8Mundy G.R. Roodman G.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 5: 209-279Google Scholar).

Rev. 1992; 13: 66-80PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-2, which is also produced by stromal cells (18Oliver L.J. Rifkin D.B. Gabrilove J. Hannocks M.J. Wilson E.L. Growth Factors. 1990; 3: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), could be important in osteoclast formation in response to hormones and cytokines. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a potent bone resorbing agent (19Hock J.M. Raisz L.G. Canalis E. Bilezikian J.P. Marcus R. Levine M.A. The Parathyroids. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 183-198Crossref Google Scholar) and inducer of osteoclast formation that plays a central role in maintaining normal serum calcium (20Fitzpatick L.A. Bilezikian J.P. Bilezikian J. Raisz L.G. Rodan G. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 339-346Google Scholar). In recent studies, we have shown that PTH increases Fgf2 gene expression in murine calvarial organ cultures and in murine osteoblastic cells (21Hurley M.M. Tetradis S. Huang Y. Hock J. Kream B.E.

Thus, the development of mice with disruption of the Fgf2 gene allowed us to assess the role of endogenous FGF-2 in PTH-induced osteoclastogenesis. Fgf2-/- mice were developed in a Black Swiss x 129Sv background (22Zhou M. Sutliff R.L. Paul R.J. Lorenz J.N. Hoying J.B. Haundenschild C.C. Moying Y. Coffin J.D. Kong L. Kranias E.G. Luo W.

Northern blot analysis of tissues from the Fgf2-/- mice revealed no wild type or truncated Fgf2 mRNA. Western blot analysis showed that none of the three isoforms of FGF-2 protein were expressed in the Fgf2-/- mice. These mice were found to have decreased vascular smooth muscle contractility, low blood pressure, thrombocytosis (22Zhou M. Sutliff R.L. Paul R.J. Lorenz J.N. Hoying J.B. Haundenschild C.C. Moying Y.

Studies have shown that PTH up-regulates RANKL mRNA expression in bone marrow stromal cells (33Lee S.K. Lorenzo J.

Because RANKL and OPG are important for OCL formation, we also investigated whether disruption of the Fgf2 gene modulated PTH-induced RANKL or OPG mRNA expression in osteoblast/spleen cell co-cultures, as well as calvarial osteoblasts from Fgf2-/- mice. In this report we assessed the role of endogenous FGF-2 in PTH-induced osteoclast formation by comparing the ability of PTH to stimulate the formation of OCL from precursor cells in bone marrow cultures and co-culture of osteoblast and spleen cells from Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- mice. We show that the ability of PTH to increase OCL formation in vitro, to resorb bone, and to increase serum calcium in vivo is markedly impaired in Fgf2-/- mice; we therefore conclude that endogenous FGF-2 is an important local factor in PTH-induced OCL formation and bone resorption in mice. Because OCL formation was also markedly reduced in RANKL- and IL-11-treated marrow stromal cultures from Fgf2-/- mice, we conclude that endogenous FGF-2 is important for maximal OCL formation in response to PTH, as well as other stimulators of OCL formation. Because the ability of PTH to regulate OPG mRNA and protein expression in osteoblasts from Fgf2-/- mice was also impaired, but OCL formation by PTH was still impaired in the presence of a neutralizing antibody to OPG, we further conclude that other signaling pathways are necessary for maximal OCL formation in the Fgf2-/- mice. Mice were bred and housed in the transgenic facility in the Center for Laboratory Animal Care at the University of Connecticut Health Center. Mice were sacrificed by CO2 narcosis and cervical dislocation. The Animal Care Committee of the University of Connecticut Health Center approved all animal protocols. Mouse Bone Marrow Cultures—Mouse bone marrow cells were isolated by a modification of previously published methods (7Hurley M.M. Lee S.K. Raisz L.G. Bernecker P. Lorenzo J. Bone. 1998; 22: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Tibiae and femurs from 8–12-week-old littermate Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- mice were dissected free of adhering tissue. Bone ends were removed, and the marrow cavity was flushed with α minimal essential medium (αMEM; Invitrogen) without serum by slowly injecting medium into one end of the bone using a sterile 25-gauge needle. Marrow cells were collected into tubes, washed twice with αMEM, and cultured in αMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HIFCS; Invitrogen). Cells were plated in 24-multiwell plates (1 × 106) cells/well. Cultures were fed every 3 days by replacing 80% of the medium with fresh medium. Effectors were added at the beginning of the culture and with each medium change. Cells for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining were fixed on day 7 of culture with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min. TRAP staining was performed with a commercial kit (Sigma). OCL were defined as TRAP positive multinucleated cells that contained greater than three nuclei. In some experiments, we determined whether PTH-induced OCL formation in marrow cultures would be rescued by a neutralizing mouse OPG antibody or the cytotoxic ligand TRAIL that blocks the anti-osteoclastic activity of OPG. TRAIL was a gift from Dr. W. Dougall Anderson (Immunex Corporation, Seattle, WA). Anti-mouse OPG antibody was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN. Co-culture of Calvarial Osteoblasts and Spleen Cells—Osteoblastic cells were prepared from calvariae of 7–9-week-old Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- mice by sequential collagenase digestion (35Wong G.L. Cohn D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3167-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Spleen cells were simultaneously harvested from splenic tissue of these mice. Osteoblastic cells (5 × 104 cells/well) and spleen cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were co-cultured for 7 days in αMEM containing 10% HIFCS in the absence or presence of agonists. At the end of the culture, cells were fixed and stained for TRAP. Resorbed Pit Formation—Bone resorption was assayed by measuring the ability of cultured bone marrow cells to form resorption pits on devitalized bovine cortical bone slices (4.4 × 4.4 × 0.2 mm) by previously described methods (7Hurley M.M. Lee S.K. Raisz L.G. Bernecker P. Lorenzo J. Bone. 1998; 22: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 36Boyde A. Ali N.N. Jones S.J. Br. Dent.

Briefly, trypsinized bone marrow cells that had been cultured for 7 days with or without effectors were allowed to settle onto the surface of bone slices for 90 min in phosphate-buffered saline. Bone slices were rinsed vigorously and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in αMEM (0.7 g of sodium bicarbonate per liter) and 10% HIFCS. After the incubation, cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, stained for TRAP, and counterstained with 1% toluidine blue in 1% borax to observe resorption pits. Pits on these bone slices were quantitated using reflected light microscopy. mRNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—In co-culture experiments, cells were cultured in 10% serum in the presence or absence of the effector for the entire culture period. For Northern blot analysis, osteoblastic cells (3.5 × 105 cells/well) and spleen cells (50 × 106 cells/well) were co-cultured in the absence or presence of PTH for 7 days. Total RNA was extracted from cells by the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and cesium chloride ultracentrifugation methods (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar, 39Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). For Northern analysis, 20 μg of total RNA was denatured and fractionated on a 0.8% agarose/1.1 m formaldehyde gel, transferred to filters by capillary blotting. and fixed to the filter by UV irradiation. After a 4-h prehybridization, filters were hybridized over-night with a [32P]cDNA probe for the mRNAs of interest. Bands were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Northern blots were quantitated by autoradiography and densitometry. The mouse RANKL cDNA was a gift from Dr. W. Dougall Anderson (Immunex Corporation, Seattle, WA). The mouse OPG cDNA was a gift from Dr. W. Boyle (AMGEN, Thousand Oaks, CA). Enzyme-linked Immunoabsorbent Assay for OPG—To measure OPG protein (40Yang X. Halladay D. Onyia J.E. Martin T.J. Chandrasekhar S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) in cell supernatants, osteoblastic cells (3.5 × 105 cells/well) and spleen cells (50 × 106 cells/well) were co-cultured in the absence or presence of PTH for 7 days. Confluent osteoblasts/spleen cells cultured for 7 days in the absence or presence of PTH were harvested, and cell supernatants were clarified by microfuge centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C). OPG protein was determined using a Quantikine M mouse OPG immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (R & D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). In Vivo PTH Administration—To examine serum calcium levels in Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- mice in response to PTH, 12–14-week-old mice were weighed and injected over the calvariae with vehicle (1 mm HCl with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) or 80 or 320 μg/kg body weight PTH (Bachem, Torrence, CA) according to the protocol of Mohan et al. (41Mohan S. Kutilek S. Zhang C. Shen H.G. Kodoma Y. Srivastava A.K. Wergedal J.E. Beamer W.G. Baylink D.J. Bone. 2000; 27: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mice were sacrificed 4 h later, and venous blood was obtained by cavernous sinus puncture. Total serum calcium was measured by a calorimetric assay (42Chapoteau E. Czech B.E. Zazulak W.R. Kumar A. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Statistics—Significant differences among groups within each experiment were determined by analysis of variance followed by post hoc Scheffe test. When multiple experiments were pooled, statistical differences between genotypes were determined by Student's t test. TRAP-stained Multinucleated Cells in Mouse Bone Marrow Cultures from Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- Mice Treated with PTH for 7 Days—We examined the effects of 7 days of treatment with PTH (10 nm) on multinucleated OCL formation in Fgf2+/+ or Fgf2-/- mouse bone marrow cultures. PTH (Fig. 1) increased the number of TRAP positive OCL that formed per well in cultures from Fgf2+/+ mice. In contrast, fewer OCLs formed in bone marrow cultures from Fgf2-/- mice that were treated with PTH. Pooling of data from four separate experiments showed that 50% fewer OCLs were formed in response to PTH in marrow cultures from Fgf2-/- mice (58 ± 12 in Fgf2-/- cells versus 116 ± 18 in Fgf2+/+ cells). We also examined the dose response effect of PTH (0.01–10 nm) on the number of OCLs that were present in 7-day Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- bone marrow cultures (Fig. 2). Few OCLs formed in unstimulated bone marrow cultures from Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- mice. PTH caused a dose-dependent increase in the number of OCLs per well in bone marrow cultures from Fgf2+/+ mice. In contrast, OCL formation at all concentrations of PTH was greatly reduced in bone marrow cultures from Fgf2-/- mice.Fig. 2Dose response effect of continuous treatment with PTH (0.01–10 nm) on OCL formation in mouse bone marrow cultures from Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/mice.

In the presence of FGF-2 (10 nm) and PTH (10 nm), the number of OCL in the cultures from the Fgf2-/- mice were similar to that observed in bone marrow cultures from Fgf2+/+ mice treated with PTH alone (Fig. 3). Effects of Co-culture of Osteoblasts and Spleen Cells from Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- Mice on Osteoclast Formation in Response to FGF-2 and PTH—To further examine the mechanism of the reduction in number of OCLs in Fgf2-/- mice, co-culture experiments were performed. Calvarial cells (fraction 2–5) from Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- mice were used as osteoblast (support) cells, and spleen cells were used as a source of osteoclast precursors. Calvarial cells were plated at (5 × 104) cells/well with (1 × 106) spleen cells/well from either Fgf2+/+ or Fgf2-/- mice and cultured in αMEM containing 10% HIFCS for 7 days. FGF-2 (10 nm) or PTH (10 nm) were added at the start of the experiment and with each media change, and OCL formation was determined by TRAP staining. Treatment with FGF-2 increased OCL formation in co-cultures of osteoblasts and spleen cells from either genotype (Fig. 4). PTH-increased OCL formation was similar in co-cultures of Fgf2+/+ osteoblasts with spleen cells of either genotype. In contrast, PTH-induced OCL formation was significantly reduced in co-cultures of osteoblasts from Fgf2-/- mice with spleen cells of either genotype (Fig. 4). Effect of the Combination of PTH and RANKL on Osteoclast-like Cell Formation in Mouse Bone Marrow Cultures from Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- Mice—To determine whether endogenous FGF-2 was specific for OCL formation by PTH, we examined the effect of RANKL to increase OCL formation in both genotypes. We also examined the effect of simultaneous treatment of bone marrow cultures with PTH and RANKL on OCL formation. PTH (10 nm) and RANKL (30 ng/ml) significantly increased OCL formation in bone marrow cultures from Fgf2+/+, mice and there was a further significant increase in the number of OCLs when the two effectors were administered simultaneously (Fig. 5A). In contrast, OCL formation by PTH and RANKL was significantly reduced in marrow stromal cells from the Fgf2-/- mice, and there was no additive effect when they were administered simultaneously. We examined whether FGF-2 would reverse the reduced OCL formation in response to RANKL. As shown in Fig 5B, OCL formation in marrow cultures from the Fgf2-/- mice was still significantly reduced in response to a very high concentration of RANKL (100 ng/ml). However, in the presence of both FGF-2 and RANKL, similar numbers of OCLS were formed in marrow cultures from both genotypes. Effect of the Combination of PTH and IL-11 on Osteoclast-like Cell Formation in Mouse Bone Marrow Cultures from Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- Mice—In previous studies, the cytokine IL-11 was reported to be important in OCL formation (43Girasole G. Passeri G. Jilka R. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1516-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). We, therefore, determined the effect of single versus simultaneous treatment of bone marrow cultures with PTH (10 nm) and IL-11 (10-9m) on OCL formation in bone marrow stromal cells from both genotypes. As shown in Fig. 6A, PTH and IL-11 significantly increased OCL formation in marrow cultures from Fgf2+/+ mice when administered either as single agents or in combination, but there was no additive effect when the two effectors were administered simultaneously. OCL formation by PTH and IL-11 was significantly reduced in marrow stromal cells from the Fgf2-/- mice, and there was no additive effect when both effectors were administered simultaneously. We determined whether FGF-2 also reversed the reduced OCL formation in response to IL-11 in marrow cultures from the Fgf2-/- mice. As shown in Fig. 6B, addition of FGF-2 (10 nm) in combination with IL-11 reversed the reduced OCL formation observed in marrow cultures from Fgf2-/- mice. Expression of RANKL and OPG mRNA in Response to PTH in Co-culture of Osteoblasts and Spleen Cells from Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- Mice—Studies have shown that PTH-mediated regulation of RANKL and OPG is critical for OCL formation (1Rodan G.A. Martin T.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1508-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 33Lee S.K. Lorenzo J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3552-3561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore compared the effects of PTH on RANKL and OPG mRNA expression in co-culture of osteoblasts and spleen cells from Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- mice. Calvarial cells (fraction 2–5) from Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- mice were used as osteoblast (support) cells, and spleen cells were used as a source of osteoclast precursors. Calvarial cells were plated at (3.5 × 105) cells/well with (50 × 106) spleen cells/well from either Fgf2+/+ or Fgf2-/- mice and cultured in αMEM containing 10% HIFCS for 7 days. Vehicle or PTH (10 nm) was added at the start of the experiment and with each media change, and total RNA was extracted after 7 days. As shown in Fig. 7 treatment with PTH increased RANKL mRNA expression in cells from both genotypes. PTH caused a 42% reduction in OPG mRNA in co-cultures from Fgf2+/+ mice. Basal OPG mRNA was markedly higher in vehicle-treated co-cultures from Fgf2-/- mice and was not decreased by PTH (Fig. 7). We also examined OPG mRNA expression in calvarial osteoblasts from"
https://openalex.org/W2089368398,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, is involved in mitotic growth arrest and differentiation. Given that numerous proteins involved in cell cycle regulation are degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, we examined whether the C/EBPalpha protein is degraded via a proteasomal mechanism. In cycloheximide-treated BALB/MK2 keratinocytes we found that C/EBPalpha is a short-lived protein with a half-life of approximately 1 h. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors, MG-132 or lactacystin, blocked the degradation of the C/EBPalpha protein. Higher molecular weight species of ubiquitinated C/EBPalpha were detected in BALB/MK2, and in vitro studies confirmed that C/EBPalpha is degraded by the proteasome in an ATP- and ubiquitin-dependent manner. GSK3 is a known C/EBPalpha kinase and treatment of keratinocytes with LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK3 resulted in: (i) a 5-fold increase in C/EBPalpha protein levels, (ii) increased electrophoretic mobility of C/EBPalpha, and (iii) no increase in C/EBPalpha mRNA levels suggesting that GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of C/EBPalpha may target it for proteasomal degradation. However, a mutant C/EBPalpha containing T to A mutations in the GSK3 phosphorylation sites (T222A and T226A) retained its response to LiCl, and additional pharmacological inhibitors of GSK3 did not alter C/EBPalpha levels indicating the effects of LiCl on C/EBPalpha are GSK3-independent. LiCl treatment of BALB/MK2 cells inhibited C/EBPalpha degradation and produced a 6-fold increase in the half-life of C/EBPalpha protein. In vitro studies revealed that LiCl inhibited proteasome activity and the ensuing degradation of C/EBPalpha. These results demonstrate C/EBPalpha is degraded via a ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway, and LiCl stabilizes C/EBPalpha through a GSK3-independent pathway involving direct inhibition of proteasome activity."

We found that TAO2 activity was increased by carbachol and that carbachol and the heterotrimeric G protein Gαo could activate p38 in 293 cells. Using dominant interfering kinase mutants, we found that MEKs 3 and 6 and TAOs were required for p38 activation by carbachol or the constitutively active mutant GαoQ205L. To explore events downstream of TAOs, the effects of TAO2 on ternary complex factors (TCFs) were investigated. Transfection studies demonstrated that TAO2 stimulates phosphorylation of the TCF Elk1 on the major activating site, Ser383, and that TAO2 stimulates transactivation of Elk1 and the related TCF, Sap1. Reporter activity was reduced by the p38-selective inhibitor SB203580. Taken together, these studies suggest that TAO protein kinases relay signals from carbachol through heterotrimeric G proteins to the p38 MAP kinase, which then activates TCFs in the nucleus.

(thousand-and-one amino acids 1) and TAO2 are protein kinases that were originally identified based on their similarity to the yeast p21-activated protein kinase Ste20p, a protein kinase upstream in a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in yeast (1Hutchison M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33287-33295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Ste20p family contains a diverse array of protein kinases, several of which have been shown to act upstream of MAPKs (4Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). TAO1 and TAO2 each contain over 1000 residues with catalytic domains at their N termini. TAOs activate MAPK pathways because they have MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) activity; they phosphorylate the p38-activating kinases called MAP/ERK kinases (MEKs, also known as MKKs or MAP2Ks) 3 and 6, which then phosphorylate p38 (1Hutchison M.

The preferential phosphorylation of these two MEKs arises in part because TAOs dock to these MEKs through a region C-terminal to the TAO kinase domain (2Chen Z. Hutchison M. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Upon phosphorylation by MAPKs, TCFs form a complex with the serum response factor at the serum response element, thereby stimulating the transcription of c-fos and other genes containing this element. The TCFs, Elk1, Sap1, and Sap2, contain a conserved C-terminal transactivation domain with multiple (S/T)P motifs, which are minimal consensus sites for MAPK phosphorylation. Elk1 can be phosphorylated by at least three MAPK subgroups, ERK1/2, c-Jun-N-terminal kinases/stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPKs), and p38. In contrast, Sap1 can be phosphorylated by ERK1/2, ERK5, and p38, but not JNK/SAPKs (7Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R.

Cotransfection studies and reporter assays demonstrated that TAO2 enhances phosphorylation and transactivation of TCFs in 293 cells. TAO2-dependent transactivation of TCFs was inhibited by the p38 selective inhibitor SB203580, suggesting that p38 is the key mediator of this action.MAPKs have readily been linked to ligand-dependent biological processes through the use of pharmacological inhibitors and gene-disruption experiments (14Chen Z.

Some of the earliest studies of p38 demonstrated that it was required for the translation of mRNAs encoding certain inflammatory cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide, for example (15Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. Mcdonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). Biochemical and overexpression experiments have implicated at least six different MAP3Ks in the regulation of p38; however, it is unclear which or how many of these kinases mediate the action of any ligand (1Hutchison M.

Therefore, overexpression and in vitro analysis have been the primary means used to probe the functions of the TAO protein kinases. Because our studies have shown that TAOs stimulate p38, we searched previously for TAO2 regulators among stress stimuli linked to p38 activity and found that TAO2 activity was increased from 1.5- to 3-fold by nocodazole, sodium chloride, and sorbitol (5Chen Z. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16070-16075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here we report that the muscarinic agonist carbachol modestly stimulates TAO2 activity and also enhances p38 activity in 293 cells. To determine whether TAOs mediate activation of p38 by carbachol, we used dominant interfering kinase mutants and found that MEKs 3 and 6 and TAOs were required for p38 activation not only by carbachol but also by a constitutively active mutant of Gαo. These findings suggest that TAOs are the intermediates that link certain heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the p38 MAPK pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Reagents—Expression plasmids for Gal-Elk (the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to the Elk1 transactivation domain) and Gal-lu (Gal4-driven luciferase) were as described (25Frost J.A.

Constitutively active mutants of MEK6 (MEK6DD), and Raf-1 (Raf BXB), and the thymidine kinase-driven renilla luciferase (pRL-TK) were generously provided by Jennifer Swantek. pCMV5-(His)6-Elk1 was as described (26Robinson M.J.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pSG-Gal-Sap (the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to the Sap1 transactivation domain) was kindly provided by Peter Shaw (Nottingham, UK). Gαo,GαoQ205L, Gαi1,Gαi1 Q204L, Gαq, and GαqQ209L were as described (27Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28625-28632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A D169A mutation was created in pCMV5-HA-TAO1 (1–416) with the QuikChange kit from Stratagene.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16070-16075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TAO2-(1–993) was used because full-length TAO2 was expressed very poorly. pCMV5-M2 (M2 muscarinic receptor) was kindly provided by Elliot Ross. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pCMV5-Myc-MEK3, pSRα-HA-MEK6, and pCS3+-MT-Myc-MEK7 plasmids to generate the mutations of the ATP binding Lys to Met, thereby creating constructs expressing kinase-deficient enzymes (5Chen Z.

The p38 inhibitor SB203580 was purchased from Calbiochem and prepared as a 20 mm solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Antibodies that recognize Elk1, phospho-Elk1, and phospho-ERK1/2 were obtained from New England Biolabs and used for immunoblotting under the recommended conditions. Polyclonal antisera C20 (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and P287 (31Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to immunoblot and immunoprecipitate p38, respectively. Anti-TAO2 antibodies were as described (5Chen Z. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16070-16075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Cell Treatment, Transfections, Reporter Assays, and Kinase Assays— Endogenous TAO2 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of 293 cells that had been serum-deprived for 18 h and then left untreated or exposed to 60 ng/ml insulin, 10 μm carbachol, 10 μm epinephrine, 10 μm isoproterenol, or 0.4 m sorbitol for 5 or 10 min. Some cells were treated with either 100 nm or 10 μm nicotine for either 1 or 10 min. The effects of 500 nm bradykinin at 5 and 15 min were also examined. TAO2 activity was assayed with MEK6KM as in Ref. 5Chen Z. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16070-16075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar. To examine the activities of endogenous p38, 3 μg of one or more of the following constructs encoding the G proteins listed above, the TAOs, and the positive and negative controls, were transfected as indicated into 293 cells cultured on 60 mm dishes at about 80% confluence using calcium phosphate as described (5Chen Z. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16070-16075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Alternatively, 3 μg of plasmids encoding GαoQ205L or pCMV5-M2 were cotransfected with 4 μg of a panel of kinase-dead constructs or empty vector control. 16 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for another 24 h and then harvested in detergent lysis buffer (5Chen Z. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16070-16075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was usually >40% under these conditions. Carbachol (10 μm) was added for 10 min prior to harvest. Endogenous p38 was immunoprecipitated from ∼0.2 mg total lysate protein and assayed using 0.3 μg of GST-ATF2 as the substrate (5Chen Z. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16070-16075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To study the phosphorylation of Elk1 in cells, 1 μg of pCMV5-(His)6-Elk1 was transfected into 293 cells with 3 μg of vector control or TAO2 constructs as described earlier. To examine the transactivation of Elk1 or Sap1, 293 cells were grown on 35-mm wells to ∼70% confluence and then transfected with 0.5 μg of Gal-Elk or Gal-Sap, and 0.5 μg of Gal-lu, 0.25 μg of pRL-TK (as an internal control for transfection efficiency) plus 1.5 μg of empty vector or vector encoding Raf BXB, MEK6DD, or TAO2. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with either Me2SO or 20 μm SB203580 and serum-starved for another 24 h before harvesting. Cell lysates were subjected to dual luciferase assays performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using a luciferase assay kit and a Turner luminometer (Promega). Relative luciferase activity was determined as the ratio of Gal4-driven firefly luciferase activity to TK-driven renilla luciferase activity. Data were plotted as fold activation compared with that induced by the empty vector control from triplicate measurements.RESULTSThe Activities of Endogenous TAO2 and p38 Are Stimulated by Carbachol—We screened a series of ligands in an attempt to identify a pathway in which TAO2 might be the MAP3K that regulates p38. C2C12 cells were untreated or treated with carbachol, sorbitol, insulin, epinephrine, or isoproterenol. TAO2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and assayed with kinase-dead MEK6 as substrate. Of the ligands tested here, only carbachol and sorbitol, a previously identified activator (5Chen Z. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16070-16075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), increased TAO2 activity >1.5-fold (Fig. 1A); activity was highest after 5 min and decreased by 10 min of treatment with either carbachol or sorbitol. Carbachol also stimulated TAO2 activity in 293 and HeLa cells, whereas other ligands, including bradykinin, did not (data not shown). TAO2 autophosphorylation and a decrease in its electrophoretic mobility corresponded well with activity at 5 min. Nicotine did not activate TAO2, although ERK1/2 were activated under these conditions (Fig. 1B). The ability of carbachol but not nicotine to activate TAO2 suggests that this effect is mediated by a muscarinic receptor.In C2C12 or 293 cells, treatment for 10 min with carbachol also weakly stimulated p38 activity 1.5–2-fold (data not shown and Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). When the M2 muscarinic receptor was overexpressed in 293 cells, carbachol caused a significantly greater activation of p38 than in cells not over-expressing the receptor (Fig. 2A, lane 4).Fig. 2Effect of inhibitory kinase mutants on activation of endogenous p38 by carbachol. A, 293 cells were transfected with either empty vector or pCMV5-M2. Cells were untreated or stimulated with carbachol for 10 min prior to harvest. Activity of endogenous p38 was assayed with ATF2 as substrate. Top panel, autoradiogram showing ATF2 phosphorylation by p38. Bottom panel, anti-p38 immunoblot as protein expression control. B, 293 cells were transfected with constructs encoding the indicated proteins. Cells were unstimulated or treated with carbachol for 10 min prior to harvest.

Coexpression of kinase-dead forms of MEK3, MEK6, or full-length TAO1 reduced activation of p38 by carbachol to less than half that in cells not expressing these mutant kinases (Fig. 2B, lanes 6, 8, and 10). Truncated, kinase-dead mutants of TAO1 and TAO2 failed to block stimulation by carbachol (Fig. 2B, lanes 12 and 14), indicating a requirement of the C-terminal domain of TAO for a blockade of p38 activation. In several experiments, expression of these truncated inactive kinases slightly enhanced both basal and carbachol-dependent p38 activity; this observation is explored further below. These results indicate that TAOs are required for activation of p38 by carbachol.Active Gαo Activates Endogenous p38 in 293 Cells—We tested the effect of Gαi1, Gαq and Gαo on the activity of endogenous p38 by transfecting cells with cDNAs encoding constitutively active forms of the G proteins, TAOs, or other potential p38 activators. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with the p38 antibody to demonstrate that its expression was unchanged (Fig. 3, bottom panel). Neither Gαq nor Gαi1 stimulated the activity of p38 and were not examined further (data not shown). Full-length TAO1 (Fig. 3, lane 3), and truncated forms of TAOs, TAO1-(1–416) (Fig. 3, lane 4) and TAO2-(1–451) (Fig. 3, lane 8), enhanced p38 activity ∼3-fold; neither kinase-dead TAO1 (Fig. 3, lane 2) nor kinase-dead TAO2 (Fig. 3, lane 7) alone affected p38 activity. Neither Raf BXB (Fig. 3, lane 10) nor wild-type Gαo (Fig. 3, lane 6) had any effect on p38 activity, but the constitutively active Gαo mutant activated p38 by ∼3-fold (Fig. 3, lane 9). Thus, active Gαo activates endogenous p38 in 293 cells.Fig. 3Gαo Q205L and TAO activate endogenous p38 in 293 cells. 293 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. After 16 h, serum was removed for 24 h prior to cell harvest. Endogenous p38 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates and assayed as described in the Fig. 2 legend. Top panel, autoradiogram showing phosphorylation of ATF2. Bottom panel, anti-p38 immunoblot of cell lysates. One of four representative experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Full-length Kinase-dead TAO1 Blocks Activation of Endogenous p38 by Active Gαo—We wished to determine whether Gαo and TAO function in the same pathway to activate p38. To address this question, we tested the effects of kinase-dead mutants of the potential kinase mediators of Gαo on activation of p38. TAO2-(1–451) (Fig. 4A, lane 3) and GαoQ205L alone (Fig. 4, lane 6) each enhanced the activity of endogenous p38 by ∼3–4-fold, as shown above. When GαoQ205L was cotransfected with kinase-defective forms of full-length TAO1 (Fig. 4, lane 7), MEK3 (Fig. 4, lane 9), or MEK6 (Fig. 4, lane 11), the activation of p38 was reduced to no more than 1.2-fold. In contrast, kinase-dead forms of MEKs 1, 5, 7, and truncated TAO2 failed to interfere with the activation of p38 by GαoQ205L (Fig. 4, lanes 8, 10, 12, and 13). Kinase-dead MEKK1, either full-length or the kinase domain alone, did not block p38 activation by the G protein (data not shown). These results suggest that GαoQ205L activates p38 through TAOs and MEK3/6.Fig. 4Kinase-defective forms of TAO, MEK3, and MEK6 block activation of endogenous p38 by GαoQ205L. A, 293 cells were transfected with empty vector control or MEKK as a positive control, TAO2 constructs, or GαoQ205L in combination with the indicated constructs encoding kinase-defective enzymes. Endogenous p38 was immunoprecipitated from the cells and assayed as described in the Fig. 2 legend. Immunoblotting indicated that equal amounts of p38 were present in the cell lysates (bottom panel). B, 293 cells were transfected with empty vector control or GαoQ205L in combination with kinase-dead TAO constructs. Top panel, activity of endogenous p38 was assayed as in for panel A. Bottom panel, immunoblot of cell lysates indicating that comparable amounts of p38 were present. One of three representative experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The C-terminal Regulatory Domain of TAO Is Required for the Blockade of p38 Activation—We noted that the defective form of full-length TAO1 blocked p38 activation by GαoQ205L, whereas the truncated TAO2 mutant failed to do so. To determine whether the blockade required the C-terminal domains of TAO proteins, the capacities of kinase-defective forms of full-length and truncated (1–416) TAO1 (full-length TAO2 could not be expressed under these conditions) to inhibit activation of p38 by GαoQ205L were compared (Fig. 4B). Unlike the full-length form of TAO1, truncated kinase-dead TAO1 lost the ability to block stimulation of p38 activity by GαoQ205L. Thus, the C-terminal regulatory domain of TAOs is apparently required for inhibition. One possible explanation is that the C termini of TAO1 and TAO2 harbor a domain that interacts with an additional protein required for a TAO activation complex; the proposed interaction may be required for efficient blockade.TAO2 Stimulates Phosphorylation of Elk1 on the Major Phosphoacceptor Site—To determine whether TAO2 enhances the phosphorylation of the TCF Elk1, pCMV5-(His)6-Elk1 was transfected into 293 cells with either the empty vector control or various TAO2 constructs. Cell lysates were blotted with either an anti-Elk1 antibody to recognize total Elk1 protein (Fig. 5, bottom panel) or an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Ser383, the major site of activating phosphorylation of Elk1 (Fig. 5, top panel) (1Hutchison M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28625-28632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2Chen Z. Hutchison M. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28803-28807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). TAO2-(1–993), TAO2-(1–320), and TAO2-(1–451) all stimulated Elk1 phosphorylation. Catalytically defective TAO2-(1–993) failed to stimulate phosphorylation, indicating that TAO2 kinase activity is required.Fig. 5TAO2 enhances phosphorylation of Elk1 on Ser383. pCMV5-(His)6-Elk1 was transfected into 293 cells with either pCMV5-Myc as a control or the indicated TAO2 constructs. 30 μg of lysate proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies that recognize either total Elk1 (bottom panel) or Elk1 phosphorylated on Ser383 (top panel).

To test this hypothesis, a chimeric construct composed of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and the Elk1 C-terminal transactivation domain (Gal-Elk) was cotransfected with a Gal4-driven luciferase construct (Gal-lu) and TAO constructs into 293 cells (Fig. 6A). Raf BXB, a constitutive activator of the ERK1/2 pathway, stimulated transactivation of Elk1 to a great extent, presumably through ERK1/2. TAO2-(1–320) and TAO2-(1–451) also stimulated Elk1 transactivation.Fig. 6TAO2-stimulated transactivation of Elk1 and Sap1. A, 293 cells were transfected with Gal-Elk, Gal-lu, and either empty vector or plasmids encoding Raf BXB or the indicated forms of TAO2. pRL-TK was also transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The result of one of three similar reporter assays, matched to data in panel B, is shown. B, 40 μg of lysate proteins from panel A were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted to detect either total ERK1/2 (bottom panel) or phosphorylated, active ERK1/2 (top panel). C, 293 cells were transfected with Gal-Sap1, Gal-lu, and either empty vector or plasmids encoding Raf BXB or TAO2-(1–320). The result of one of three similar reporter assays, matched to data in panel D, is shown.

Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16070-16075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that TAO signals to TCFs through p38. To confirm that ERK1/2 are not involved in the effect of TAO2 on Elk1 transactivation, lysates from cells that had been subjected to reporter assays (Fig. 6A) were immunoblotted with antibodies to detect total ERK1/2 proteins and active ERK1/2 proteins (Fig. 6B). Raf BXB greatly enhanced the amount of active ERK1/2 relative to the control. In contrast, in TAO2-transfected cells, even though transactivation of Elk1 was stimulated to a comparable extent as by Raf BXB, no active ERK1/2 were detected. PD98059, which blocks activation of ERK1/2, did not inhibit TAO-mediated Elk1 transactivation (data not shown).We also examined the effects of TAO2 on transactivation of the TCF, Sap1. Sap1 can be activated by ERK1/2 and p38, but not JNK/SAPKs. A Gal4-Sap1 fusion construct (Gal-Sap) was cotransfected with Gal-lu and either Raf BXB or TAO2-(1–320) into 293 cells (Fig. 6C). As expected, Raf BXB greatly stimulated transactivation of Sap1. TAO2-(1–320) also stimulated Sap1 transactivation. To confirm that ERK1/2 are not i"

We showed previously that Ste7 is ubiquitinated upon prolonged stimulation by pheromone and that accumulation of ubiquitinated Ste7 results in enhanced transcription and cell division arrest responses (Wang, Y., and Dohlman, H. G. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 15766–15772). We now report that ubiquitination of Ste7 requires Ste11 kinase and Skp1/Cullin/F-box (SCF) ubiquitin-conjugating activities. Ste7 is not ubiquitinated in Ste11-deficient cells or when the Ste11 phosphorylation sites have been mutated. Ste7 ubiquitination and degradation (but not phosphorylation) is specifically blocked in mutants defective for the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34 or the cullin homologue Cdc53. Both are components of the SCF complex that ubiquitinates proteins during the G1-S transition of the cell cycle. Our findings suggest that SCF promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of Ste7, thereby favoring the resumption of cell division cycling after pheromone-induced growth arrest.

Many cell regulators exert their action by binding to cell surface receptors coupled to G proteins. In mammals, receptors of this type can detect hormones, neurotransmitters, odors, taste, and light. In yeast, G protein-coupled receptors respond to mating pheromones that trigger fusion of a and α haploid cells (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Upon pheromone stimulation of its receptor (Ste2 or Ste3), the G protein α subunit (Gpa1) binds to GTP and dissociates from the G protein βγ subunits (Ste4/Ste18). The Gβγ dimer can then propagate the mating signal through activation of effector proteins, including a protein kinase (Ste20), a kinase scaffolding protein (Ste5), and the Cdc42 GDP-GTP exchange factor (Cdc24). These effectors go on to activate a mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; UBP, ubiquitin-specific processing protease; SCF, Skp1-Cullin-F-box; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin conjugating protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase. cascade comprised of a MAPK kinase kinase (Ste11), which phosphorylates and activates a dual specificity MAPK kinase (Ste7), which in turn phosphorylates and activates two related MAPKs (Fus3 and Kss1). MAPK substrates include a transcription factor (Ste12) and associated regulators (Dig1 and Dig2), phosphorylation of which lead to enhanced expression of specific genes involved in mating. Another MAPK substrate is the cell cycle regulator Far1, which promotes cell division arrest in late G1 phase where mating occurs (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). It has long been recognized that many signaling proteins are regulated by phosphorylation. A small but growing number of signaling proteins appear to be ubiquitinated as well. Ubiquitination typically requires three distinct enzymatic activities: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin-ligase (E3). Several classes of E3 enzymes have been identified, each having a distinct catalytic mechanism. Best known are those containing a HECT or RING domain, whereas the recently described U-box protein family represents a third class of E3 enzymes (2Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). E3 enzymes catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin and Lys side chains of the target protein (3Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). Conjugated ubiquitin is itself ubiquitinated, resulting in the formation of poly-ubiquitin chains. The polyubiquitinated protein is usually then captured and degraded by a large compartmentalized protease particle, the 26 S proteasome (4Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). In yeast several components of the pheromone-signaling cascade are ubiquitinated, including the receptor (5Hicke L.

A. 2002; 99: 9160-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the case of cell surface receptors, ubiquitination functions as a signal for ligand-induced endocytosis. This situation is unusual, however, in that the receptors are largely mono-ubiquitinated instead of polyubiquitinated and delivered to the vacuole instead of the proteasome (5Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 6Hicke L. Zanolari B. Riezman H. J.

Ubiquitination of Ste7 is also dependent on prolonged pheromone stimulation, but in this case the protein is degraded by the proteasome (10Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15766-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mechanism of pheromone-dependent ubiquitination and the enzymes responsible for this modification have not been established. Here we show that ubiquitination and degradation of Ste7 requires Ste11 phosphorylation and Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin-conjugating activities.

Ge and B. Errede, manuscript in preparation. ; and those expressing various STE5 alleles and the STE5 promoter, specifically pCJ136 (YCplac33-STE5), pCJ138 (YCplac33-STE5V763P,S861P), and pCJ149 (YCplac33-STE5C177A,C180A-GST) (13Inouye C. Dhillon N. Durfee T. Zambryski P.C. Thorner J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 479-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of UBP3 was achieved by PCR amplification and subcloning into the pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO (2 μm, URA3, GAL1 promoter, CYC1 terminator) (Invitrogen). The PCR primers were 5′-CCA GAA TGA ACA TGC AAG ACG CTA ACA AAG AAG-3′ and 5′-GCA ATC GTG CTC ACT AT CG-3′ (for UBP3). The UBP3 allele encoding a catalytically inactive dominant negative form of Ubp3 (Ubp3C469S) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using UBP3 in pYES2.1 as the template (Qiagen). Mutagenesis primers were 5′-CAG AGC CAA CAT TTC TTT TAT GAG TTC TGT G-3′ and 5′-CAC AGA ACT CAT AAA AGA AAT GTT GGC TCT G-3′. Ste7 Ubiquitination and Degradation Assays—Ubiquitination of Ste7 results in the formation of a high molecular weight species that is recognized by both anti-Ste7 and anti-ubiquitin antibodies following immunoprecipitation of Ste7. Detection of ubi-Ste7 requires that it be stabilized, either by using cim3-1 mutants, which are deficient in 26 S proteasome activity, a ubp3Δ gene deletion mutant, or by expressing a catalytically inactive dominant negative form of Ubp3 (Ubp3C469S). This is analogous to using specific phosphatase inhibitors to preserve transient increases in protein phosphorylation. To monitor the loss of Ste7 over time, mid-log cell cultures were treated with 3 μm α-factor for 60 min, followed by cycloheximide (final concentrations, 10 μg/ml in 0.1% ethanol) for up to 120 min. Growth was stopped by the addition of 10 mm NaN3 and transfer to an ice bath. The cells were washed and resuspended directly in boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.0005% bromphenol blue) for 10 min, subjected to glass bead homogenization, and clarified by microcentrifugation. Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, the membrane was probed with antibodies to Ste7 at 1:200 (yN-18) (Santa Cruz). Immunoreactive species were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce) of horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) or anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz). Specificity of detection was established using ste7Δ cell extracts as negative controls (10Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15766-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is well established that pheromone stimulation promotes phosphorylation of Ste7 by Ste11. We have shown recently that pheromone stimulation also promotes ubiquitination of Ste7 (10Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15766-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The enzymes that ubiquitinate Ste7 have not been identified. Our goal here was to identify those enzymes and to determine the mechanism underlying pheromone regulation of ubiquitination. Our initial approach was to examine the ubiquitination and signaling properties of strains lacking each of the proteins known to bind or phosphorylate Ste7. These include Ste11, the Ste7 substrates Fus3 and Kss1, as well as the kinase scaffolding protein Ste5. We postulated that deletion of STE11 or STE5 might block ubiquitination, because both are required for activation of Ste7. Ste7 phosphorylates Fus3/Kss1, but this is not required for Ste7 activity and might therefore not be required for ubiquitination (14Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). On the other hand Ste7 is a substrate for Fus3/Kss1, and this feedback phosphorylation event might be required (14Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15Errede B. Gartner A. Zhou Z. Nasmyth K. Ammerer G.

For all of our experiments we monitored Ste7 ubiquitination by immunoblotting with Ste7 antibodies. We have shown previously that ubiquitination of Ste7 results in the formation of a high molecular weight species that migrates slowly in SDS-PAGE. That species is recognized by anti-Ste7 antibodies as well as by anti-ubiquitin antibodies following Ste7 immunoprecipitation (10Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15766-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In each experiment we either deleted the UBP3 gene or expressed a catalytically inactive dominant negative form of Ubp3 (Ubp3C469S) (20Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) to stabilize ubiquitinated Ste7. Cells in mid-log phase were treated with α-factor pheromone, harvested, lysed directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Under these conditions, ubiquitinated Ste7 accumulates slowly, becoming fully modified after 60 min of pheromone treatment (Fig. 1). Although the ubiquitin-modified protein is easily detected in wild-type cells, none is detected in ste5Δ, ste11Δ, or fus3Δ/kss1Δ mutants (Fig. 2). Thus it appears that deletion of any component of the MAPK assembly is sufficient to block ubiquitination of Ste7.Fig. 2Pheromone-dependent ubiquitination of Ste7 requires known binding proteins. Strains YPH499 (WT), ETB1 (ste5Δ), YTG11 (ste11Δ), and YDM300 (fus3Δ kss1Δ), each transformed with plasmid pYES2.1 expressing a dominant negative form of Ubp3 (Ubp3C469S), were grown to mid-log phase and treated with 3 μm α-factor for 60 min as indicated. The cell extracts were prepared and resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (IB) using anti-Ste7 polyclonal antiserum, as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then examined whether phosphorylation per se, as opposed to expression of the phosphorylating kinase, is required for ubiquitination of Ste7. Ste11 is required for Ste7 function, because mutational replacement of the Ste11 phosphorylation sites (Ser359 and Thr363) completely abolishes the biological activity of Ste7 (21Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We transformed a ste7Δ strain with plasmids that express wild-type Ste7, a Ste7 mutant lacking the Ste11 phosphorylation sites (Ste7A2) (18Zhou Z. Gartner A. Cade R. Ammerer G. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 22Neiman A.M. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3398-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), or a multiply substituted mutant that does not undergo feedback phosphorylation by Fus3/Kss1 (Ste7A7) (19Errede B. Ge Q.-Y. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).2 As shown in Fig. 3, pheromone-dependent ubiquitination is blocked in the Ste7A2 mutant but not by the Ste7A7 mutant. Ste7A7 does not undergo a pheromone-dependent mobility shift, consistent with loss of Fus3/Kss1 phosphorylation.2 Thus it appears that phosphorylation by Ste11 is necessary for ubiquitination of Ste7. We also examined whether Ste5 might play a direct role in ubiquitination of Ste7. The only known function of Ste5 is to assemble Ste11, Ste7, and Kss1/Fus3 kinases (23Choi K.Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 24Printen J.A. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genetics. 1994; 138: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Ste5 also has a RING-H2 domain found in some E3 ubiquitin ligases, and we have speculated that Ste5 might directly ubiquitinate its binding partner Ste7 (10Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15766-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To test this we examined whether RING domain substitutions at Cys177 and Cys180 (Ste5C177A,C180A) would block the ubiquitination of Ste7. The RING domain is also required for binding of Gβγ (25Inouye C. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Science. 1997; 278: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus we fused Ste5C177A,C180A to glutathione S-transferase (Ste5C177A,C180A-GST). Dimerization of GST bypasses the requirement for G protein activation, resulting in a constitutive signal (26Sette C. Inouye C.J. Stroschein S.L. Iaquinta P.J. Thorner J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4033-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, Ste7 expression is diminished in cells expressing Ste5C177A,C180A-GST, but it is nevertheless ubiquitinated. Ubiquitination occurs even in the absence of added pheromone, consistent with a constitutive signaling phenotype exhibited by Ste5C177A,C180A-GST (26Sette C. Inouye C.J. Stroschein S.L. Iaquinta P.J. Thorner J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4033-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus it appears that the RING domain of Ste5 is not necessary for ubiquitination of Ste7. These data argue against the model that Ste5 is the E3 ubiquitin ligase for Ste7. Although the Ste5 RING domain appears not to be required for Ste7 ubiquitination, Ste5 may still play a direct role in this regulatory process. It was observed previously that Ste5 binds preferentially to an inactive hypophosphorylated form of Ste7 (23Choi K.Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation and activation of Ste7 leads to dissociation from Ste5. Dissociation from Ste5 might expose Ste7 to the appropriate modifying enzymes, and this might be sufficient for ubiquitination to occur. Thus we considered whether dissociation from Ste5 could itself trigger the ubiquitination of Ste7. To this end we monitored Ste7 ubiquitination in cells that express Ste5V763A,S861P, a mutant that is unable to bind to Ste7 yet is competent to bind Ste11 (13Inouye C. Dhillon N. Durfee T. Zambryski P.C. Thorner J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 479-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, this mutation eliminates ubiquitination of Ste7. We conclude that dissociation of Ste7 from Ste5 is not itself a signal for ubiquitination. The data so far indicate that phosphorylation by Ste11 is required for ubiquitination of Ste7. Ste5 is also required, but it does not appear to directly ubiquitinate Ste7 (Ste5 could still act as an E3 ligase for other substrates). Thus we considered whether the SCF complex could instead serve this function, because it is required for progression through the G1-S transition where pheromone arrest occurs. Moreover, most if not all SCF substrates are phosphorylated prior to being ubiquitinated (27Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The SCF complex is comprised of four proteins: Cdc53 (cullin), the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Cdc34 (also known as Ubc3), the RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase Hrt1, and the substrate adapter protein Skp1 (27Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). For these experiments we compared ubiquitination of Ste7 using temperature sensitive cdc34-2 and cdc53-1 mutants (27Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Growth at 37 °C inactivates each of these mutants, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the late G1 phase. As shown in Fig. 6A, pheromone-dependent ubiquitination is blocked in both the cdc34-2 and cdc53-1 mutant strains. Ubiquitination is unaffected by cdc28-1, another temperature-sensitive mutant that also blocks cell division at late G1 but that is not part of the SCF complex (Fig. 6B). We conclude from these experiments that SCF function is needed for ubiquitination of Ste7. As an additional control we tested Ste7 ubiquitination in a panel of mutants affecting other E2 family members in yeast, including ubc1, ubc2, ubc4, ubc5, ubc6, ubc7, ubc8, ubc10, ubc11, ubc12, and ubc13. In some cases double mutants (ubc1/ubc4, ubc2/ubc4, ubc4/ubc5, and ubc6/ubc7) were used, because some Ubc isoforms are partially redundant in function. None of these other enzymes altered the ubiquitination of Ste7 (Table I and data not shown). Thus it appears that Ste7 ubiquitination requires SCF activity specifically and is not blocked simply as a result of arrest in G1 or of growth at 37 °C. The data presented above indicated that SCF is required for ubiquitination of Ste7. The defect in Ste7 ubiquitination is not the result of cell cycle arrest, because ubiquitination is still observed in the cdc28 mutant (Fig. 6B). We also considered whether cell cycle arrest is necessary for Ste7 ubiquitination. This seemed likely given that prolonged pheromone stimulation is required before ubiquitination is evident (Fig. 1). To this end we tested fus3Δ and far1Δ mutants, which diminish and eliminate pheromone-dependent growth arrest response, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7, Ste7 ubiquitination is diminished in the fus3Δ mutant and eliminated in the far1Δ mutant. These data suggest that G1 arrest is indeed necessary for Ste7 ubiquitination. It is clearly not sufficient, however, because ubiquitination in the cdc28 mutant still requires pheromone addition (Fig. 6B). Moreover, the far1 mutant does not block Ste7 phosphorylation. This result indicates that although phosphorylation is necessary for Ste7 ubiquitination, it too is not sufficient. The data presented above indicated that phosphorylation and cell cycle arrest are necessary (but not sufficient) for Ste7 ubiquitination. We then investigated whether ubiquitination leads to Ste7 degradation. This is not self-evident, because some proteins undergo ubiquitination without being degraded or targeted to the proteasome. For instance in yeast the ubiquitinated form of the transcription factor Met4 is stabile and remains associated with target promoters, although it fails to form a functional transcription complex (28Kaiser P. Flick K. Wittenberg C. Reed S.I. Cell. 2000; 102: 303-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus we tested whether pheromone stimulation promotes Ste7 degradation. Wild-type cells were treated with α-factor to induce phosphorylation and ubiquitination and then treated with cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis. Expression of remaining Ste7 was monitored by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 8, Ste7 abundance declined more quickly after pheromone treatment. The treated sample was initially more abundant, but by the end of the time course it was less abundant than the untreated sample. The more quickly migrating unphosphorylated form of Ste7 was even more stabile, with little or no decrease in expression even after 90 min of cycloheximide treatment. The apparent stability of unphosphorylated Ste7 is consistent with our finding that phosphorylation is necessary for ubiquitination. We then investigated whether mutants that diminish Ste7 ubiquitination also diminish Ste7 degradation. The cdc34-2 and cdc53-1 mutants were shifted to 37 °C to inactivate SCF, treated with α-factor to induce phosphorylation and ubiquitination, and then treated with cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 9, the loss of Ste7 is slowed at least 3-fold in the ubiquitination-deficient cdc34-2 or cdc53-1 mutant cells, as compared with wild-type cells grown under identical conditions. Taken together, these results indicate that pheromone stimulation accelerates phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and ultimately the degradation of Ste7.Fig. 9Ubiquitination promotes the degradation of Ste7. Strains MTY235 (WT), MTY670 (cdc34-2) and MTY740 (cdc53-1) were grown at 24 °C to an A600nm of ∼0.2–0.4, shifted to 37 °C for 3 h, and treated with 3 μm α-factor for 60 min. The cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for the indicated times. The cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting, as described in the legend to Fig. 1, and densitometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Many biological processes are regulated through the ubiquitination and degradation of cellular proteins. Ubiquitination has been shown to play a key role in regulation of the cell cycle (via destruction of mitotic cyclins), transcription (p53, NFκB), differentiation, and development (growth factor receptors). There is also a growing number of G protein signaling proteins shown to be ubiquitinated. Examples can be found in mammals and yeasts and include G protein-coupled receptors (5Hicke L. Riezman H.

Cell. 2002; 2: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In yeast, ubiquitination of cell surface receptors serves as a signal for ligand-induced endocytosis and delivery to the vacuole/lysosome (5Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 7Roth A.F. Sullivan D.M. Davis N.G. J.

Ubiquitination of the Gα subunit Gpa1 is needed for sustained pheromone signaling in vivo. Gpa1 is also notable because it is the only substrate for which the in vivo ubiquitination site has been mapped directly by mass spectrometry (8Marotti Jr., L.A. Newitt R. Wang Y. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5067-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Clearly, improved understanding of how ubiquitination is regulated is important to our understanding of cell regulation. A particular challenge in carrying out these studies has been the detection of ubiquitination substrates in vivo. This has much to do with the inherent instability of most ubiquitinmodified proteins. For reasons that are unclear, this has been especially difficult in yeast. To address this problem we previously used mutant strains that lack UBP ubiquitin-specific processing proteases, which cleave the amide bond between ubiquitin and the substrate protein (39Wilkinson K.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Deletion of the UBP3 gene results in stable expression of the ubiquitinated form of Ste7, and this allowed us to demonstrate that the ubiquitination is elevated following pheromone stimulation (10Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15766-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ste7 is notable because it was the first example of a MAPK kinase that is ubiquitinated. Moreover, this modification is likely to be functionally important, because ubp3Δ mutants exhibit elevated MAPK-regulated gene transcription and growth arrest responses (10Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15766-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Another challenge has been determining the mechanisms by which specific substrates are ubiquitinated. One way specificity is achieved is by the large number of E2 and E3 isoforms, which bind protein substrates with a high degree of selectivity (40Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that the Cdc34 and Cdc53 components of SCF are required for ubiquitination and efficient degradation of Ste7. Cdc34 and Cdc53 were first identified genetically, as mutants defective in G1/S transition in yeast (27Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Cdc53 was independently identified through its association with the G1 cyclin Cln2 (41Mathias N. Johnson S.L. Winey M. Adams A.E.

Kobayashi R. Wittenberg C. Tyers M. Cell. 1996; 86: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The cell cycle defect exhibited by each mutant was traced to an inability to eliminate the G1 cyclin Cln2 (42Willems A.R. Lanker S. Patton E.E. Craig K.L. Nason T.F. Mathias N. Kobayashi R. Wittenberg C. Tyers M. Cell. 1996; 86: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 (43Schwob E. Bohm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), which are normally destroyed as the cell enters S phase. Cdc34 and Cdc53 were later shown to assemble with Skp1 and Hrt1 to form the SCF complex (44Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 45Feldman R.M. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Skp1 binds one of several dozen F box proteins, which together recruit specific substrates to the core complex for ubiquitination. In yeast the criteria most commonly used to identify SCF substrates is accumulation or stabilization in SCF mutants. Substrates identified in this manner vary widely in function and include G1 cyclins (Cln1, Cln2, and Cln3), Cdc28 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (Far1 and Sic1), signaling proteins (Gic2), transcriptional regulators (Gcn4), and F box proteins associated with SCF itself (Cdc4 and Grr1) (reviewed in Ref. 27Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that mutations in Cdc34 and Cdc53 inhibit Ste7 ubiquitination and degradation. No other E2 enzyme affects Ste7 in this manner. Another way to achieve specificity is through phosphorylation of the intended substrate. Here we have shown that Ste7 must be phosphorylated by Ste11 for it to be ubiquitinated. This fits the pattern of known SCF substrates, all of which must undergo phosphorylation prior to being ubiquitinated (27Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). One example is Gic1, an effector for the small GTPase protein Cdc42, which is stabilized by mutations that block phosphorylation (46Jaquenoud M. Gulli M.P. Peter K. Peter M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5360-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Another example is Far1, an inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinase Cdc28. Far1 is itself phosphorylated by Cdc28, and this event is required for binding to an SCF adapter protein Cdc4 (47Henchoz S. Chi Y. Catarin B. Herskowitz I. Deshaies R.J. Peter M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3046-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus it appears that the phosphate group constitutes part of the SCF substrate recognition structure. We have shown previously that pheromone promotes ubiquitination of Ste7, and this leads to an attenuation of signaling (10Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15766-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated that pheromone-dependent ubiquitination requires phosphorylation by Ste11 (ste7A2 and ste11Δ), cell division arrest (far1Δ), and a functional SCF (cdc34-2 and cdc53-1). Ubiquitination of Ste7 also promotes its degradation. We conclude that pheromone promotes signal inactivation through accelerated ubiquitination and degradation of Ste7. Pheromone also promotes signal activation through increased Ste7 kinase function. Thus our current efforts are aimed at understanding how such obviously opposing events are coordinated. Given that no Ste7 phosphatase has yet been identified, our present model is that Ste7 degradation serves to limit the activity of the kinase, in lieu of Ste7 dephosphorylation. A cycle of pheromone-dependent activation and degradation of Ste7 would prevent sustained activation of the MAPK and MAPK-dependent responses, allowing the cell to eventually desensitize and resume normal cell division. The requirement of SCF for ubiquitination and degradation of Ste7, as well as for ubiquitination and degradation of cell cycle regulators, would in this way facilitate the resumption of cell division cycling after prolonged pheromone stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2162005133,"Outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 is an isoform of microsomal membrane cytochrome b5. In rat testes the outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 is present in both mitochondria and microsomes, whereas microsomal membrane cytochrome b5 is undetectable. Outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 present in the testis was localized in Leydig cells with cytochrome P-45017α, which catalyzes androgenesis therein. We therefore analyzed the functions of outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 in rat testis microsomes by using a proteoliposome system. In a low but physiological concentration of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and excess amount of progesterone, outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 stimulated the cytochrome P-45017α-catalyzed reactions, 17α-hydroxylation and C17-C20 bond cleavage. The effects were different from those by microsomal membrane cytochrome b5 as follows: preferential elevation of the 17α-hydroxylase activity by outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 in an amount-dependent manner versus that of the lyase activity by microsomal membrane cytochrome b5 at the low concentration, and the inhibition of both activities at the high concentration. At a low concentration of progesterone reflecting a physiological cholesterol supply, outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 elevated primarily the production of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and then facilitated the conversion of the released intermediate to androstenedione. Thus, we demonstrated that outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 and not microsomal membrane cytochrome b5 functions as an activator for androgenesis in rat Leydig cells.

Thus, we demonstrated that outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 and not microsomal membrane cytochrome b5 functions as an activator for androgenesis in rat Leydig cells. Two isoforms of cytochrome b5 are known to exist in a single cell. One is microsomal cytochrome b5 (b5) 1The abbreviations used are: b5, microsomal membrane cytochrome b5; OMb, outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5; P-45017α, cytochrome P-45017α (cytochrome P-450 catalyzing the 17α-hydroxylation and C17-C20 bond cleavage of pregnenolone and progesterone); P-450scc, cytochrome P-450scc (cytochrome P-450 catalyzing the side chain cleavage of cholesterol); P-450 reductase, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBS, Na-Pi-buffered saline; StAR protein, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the other is outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 (OMb) (1Fukushima K. Ito A. Omura T. Sato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1972; 71: 447-461PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 3Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). They consist of the following three domains: (a) the amino-terminal hydrophilic, (b) medial hydrophobic, and (c) carboxyl-terminal hydrophilic domains. A protoheme is bound to the first domain, which is highly conserved between b5 and OMb with 70% identity (4Lederer F. Ghrir R. Guiard B. Cortial S. Ito A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5De Silvertis M. D'Arrigo A. Borgese N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic domain, consisting of about 20 amino acid residues, is embedded in the lipid bilayer and functions for the insertion of proteins into the membranes as tail-anchored proteins (6Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilgen G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acid residues of b5 are exposed to the luminal side of the ER cisterna (7Vergeres G. Ramsden J. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3414-3422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Kuroda R. Kinoshita J. Honsho M. Mitoma J. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and are required for the targeting of the cytochrome to the organelle (9Mitoma J. Ito A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The visible spectroscopic properties of the reduced forms are characteristic of the b5-type hemoproteins. OMb and b5 are spectrographically indistinguishable from each other due to the highly conserved heme-binding portion (1Fukushima K. Ito A. Omura T. Sato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1972; 71: 447-461PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). OMb and b5 have a similar mobility on SDS-PAGE and are co-purified unless specific precaution was taken in the purification procedures. Antibodies directed against b5 that had been purified without the removal step of OMb cross-react with OMb. In some case, cross-reactions are observed even if a highly purified form of OMb or b5 was immunized in rabbits. These facts made the discrimination between OMb and b5 difficult. The most convincing way of the discrimination is use of the specific antibodies. We have such antibodies in a large collection of anti-OMb and anti-b5 antibodies. Because b5 is a hemoprotein with sixth co-ordination, it is incapable of activating an oxygen molecule as cytochrome P-450 does. One of its physiological functions is an electron transfer to terminal oxidases such as stearyl-CoA desaturase (10Ozols J. Ann. Clin. Res. 1976; 8: 182-192PubMed Google Scholar). Some evidence also suggests that b5 functions as a modifier for some cytochrome P-450-catalyzed reactions although its mechanism is not clear (11Hilderbrandt A. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 66-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 12Guengerich F.P. Martin M.V. Beaune P.H. Kremers P. Wolff T. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5051-5060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, b5 stimulates the 6β-hydroxylation of testosterone and nifedipine oxidation by recombinant CYP3A4 (13Yamazaki H. Useng Y.-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8380-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It also augments C17-C20 lyase activity of pig, guinea pig, and human P-45017α leading to predominant formation of androgens (androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone) over 17α-hydroxylated steroids (progesterone and pregnenolone) (14Onoda M. Hall P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Kominami S. Ogawa N. Morimune R. Huang D.Y. Takemori S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Without involvement of added b5, the lyase activity of the P-45017α is too low to account for physiological production of androgens in vivo. The physiological functions of OMb are not well understood. The sole experimental evidence for the function is that specific antibodies against rat OMb inhibited semidehydroascorbate reductase, which catalyzes regeneration of half-oxidized ascorbic acid, in outer mitochondrial membrane fractions of rat liver cells (17Ito A. Hayashi S. Yoshida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Nishino H. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In a study on the mechanism for subcellular localization of OMb, we have recently observed that it moves from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the ER membrane in a few hours after administration of dexamethasone, pregnenolone-16α-carbonitrile, or phenobarbital to rats. 2K. Abe, J. Kinoshita, T. Ogishima, and A. Ito, manuscript in preparation. In tissues other than liver, such as kidney and adrenal glands of rats, OMb was present in ER in addition to mitochondria. These results indicate that OMb has the potential to be localized either in outer mitochondrial membranes or in ER membranes, although the localization signal of OMb seems to reside in the carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acid residues favorable for mitochondrial targeting (19Kuroda R. Ikenoue T. Honsho M. Tujimoto S. Mitoma J. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31097-31102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In guinea pig, OMb is abundant in adrenal glands, where its localization is exclusively ER. Surprisingly, b5 is scarcely detected in rat testicular cells, where OMb is distributed almost equally between the outer mitochondrial membranes and ER membranes in considerably high amounts. This suggests that OMb and not b5 could regulate testicular androgen synthesis by modifying the lyase activity of P-45017α. The indistinguishable properties between OMb and b5 as described above propose a possibility that the stimulatory effects on P-450 that have been believed to be done by b5 are exerted by OMb. Thus, in this study we analyzed the effects of OMb on rat P-45017α, and we found that this cytochrome is a genuine modulator for testicular androgen synthesis in rats. Animals—Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 120–150 g and male Hartley guinea pigs weighing 450–500 g were purchased from Kyudo Co., Ltd. (Kumamoto, Japan). All surgical and experimental procedures were approved and conducted in accordance with the policies of Kyushu University's Animal Care and Use Committee. Cellular Fractionation and Detection of OMb and b5—Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 120–150 g were intraperitoneally injected with sodium phenobarbital at a dose of 80 mg/kg and killed after 24 h. Liver and testes were removed and homogenized using a Teflon glass homogenizer in ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.25 m sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A. After the homogenates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min, the resultant supernatants were recentrifuged at 6,000 × g for 10 min to obtain the mitochondrial fractions. Microsomal fractions were obtained by centrifugation of the post-mitochondrial supernatants at 105,000 × g for 60 min. All procedures were done at 4 °C. For analysis of the distribution of OMb and b5 in the tissues, the subcellular fractions form the tissues and were separated by Tricine/SDS-PAGE (20Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane was incubated first with specific anti-rat OMb or anti-rat b5 IgG and second with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase complex, and the immunoreactive bands were finally visualized by chemiluminescence using Western Lighting™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Enzyme Preparations—All enzyme preparations except as described otherwise were conducted with K-Pi buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Rat P-45017α and OMb were solubilized from rat testis microsomes with the 10 mm K-Pi buffer containing 1.4% (w/v) Emulgen 913 (a kind gift from Kao Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) and 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin and after dilution of the detergent to 0.2% absorbed to ω-aminohexyl-Toyopearl column (1.2 × 8.0 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm K-Pi buffer containing 0.2% Emulgen 913. After washing with the 10 mm K-Pi buffer containing 0.2% Emulgen 913, the column was eluted with the 10 mm K-Pi buffer containing 0.2% Emulgen 913 and 0.2% sodium cholate. The eluate contained P-45017α. The column was then washed with the 10 mm K-Pi buffer containing 0.4% Emulgen 913 and eluted with the 10 mm K-Pi buffer containing 0.5 m KCl and 0.4% Emulgen 913. The eluate contained OMb. Both enzymes were further purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a TSK DEAE-5PW column (7.5 × 75 mm, TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) with a linear gradient of KCl (0–500 mm/60 min) in the 10 mm K-Pi buffer containing 0.4% Emulgen 913. Purified P-45017α was applied to a hydroxylapatite column, and the column was washed extensively with the 10 mm K-Pi buffer without Emulgen 913. The enzyme was eluted from the gel batch with the 400 mm K-Pi buffer containing 10% (w/v) l-α-phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk (Wako Pure Chemical Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and 1% sodium cholate. Proteoliposomes embedded with P-45017α were prepared by a cholate dialysis method as described (21Kominami S. Inoue S. Higuchi A. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). By using a hydroxylapatite column, detergent-free OMb was also prepared. Rat b5 was solubilized from liver microsomes and purified with the same method as OMb. NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase (P-450 reductase) was solubilized from liver microsomes of phenobarbital-treated rats and purified as described (22Kominami S. Ogishima T. Takemori S. Massey V. Williams C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Elsevier North-Holland Inc., Amsterdam1982: 715-718Google Scholar). Guinea pig P-45017α, OMb, and b5 were purified from the microsomal fractions of the adrenal glands with the same method as the rat enzyme. The OMb and b5 were separated from each other by the TSK DEAE-5PW and hydroxylapatite column chromatographies. Construct of Recombinant OMb and Its Expression in E. coli—An amino-terminal hexahistidine-tagged OMb construct was created by a PCR. The amplified cDNA was inserted into pET-3d vectors at the NdeI and BamHI sites to yield pET-hisOMb. BL21 (DE3) strain transformed with pET-hisOMb was cultured for 40 h at 25 °C, and then the transformant was harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 15 min. After sonication the suspension was centrifuged at 177,100 × g for 1 h. The pellets were solubilized in 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5) buffer containing 20% glycerol and 2% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 177,100 × g for 1 h, the resultant supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-preloaded HisTrap chelating column (1 ml, Amersham Biosciences AB) equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5) buffer containing 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.5 m NaCl. After washed with the equilibrating buffer, the column was eluted with the same buffer except containing 0.5 m imidazole. Because effects of the recombinant OMb on the P-45017α-catalyzed reaction were indistinguishable from those of the native forms that were purified from testes and livers, the recombinant OMb was mainly used in this study. Measurement of 17α-Hydroxylase and C17-C20 Lyase Activities of P-45017α—P-45017α containing proteoliposomes were preincubated with P-450 reductase and either OMb or b5 in a volume of 0.05 ml of 50 mm K-Pi buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol for 60 min at 0 °C. After diluting 10-fold with 20 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4), progesterone in propylene glycol was added to the reaction mixture. Reaction was started with addition of NADPH at a final concentration of 1 mm and proceeded for 10–20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 ml of n-hexane, and the products were extracted twice with the solvent. After drying under a stream of N2 gas, the steroids were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography using a COSMOSIL 5SL-II column (4.6 × 150 mm, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) equilibrated and eluted with a solvent (n-hexane:2-propanol:acetic acid = 95:5:1). Androstenedione (lyase activity) and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17α-hydroxylase activity) were quantified by measuring their absorbance at 240 nm. In some experiments, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone was used as the substrate. Enzyme and Protein Concentrations—The concentrations of P-45017α were determined spectrophotometrically using a molecular coefficient of 91 mm-1·cm-1 for the CO difference spectrum of the reduced form (23Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of OMb and b5 were determined from the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum between 424 and 409 nm by using a molecular coefficient of 185 mm-1·cm-1 of b5 assuming that spectrographic properties of detergent-solubilized forms of OMb and b5 were indistinguishable from that of a trypsin-solubilized form of b5 at a Soret band (23Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Omura T. Takesue S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1970; 67: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The concentration of P-450 reductase was determined from the absorbance at 455 nm by using a molecular coefficient of 21.4 mm-1·cm-1 (25French J.S. Coon M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Amounts of P-450 reductase in rat testis microsomes were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-rat P-450 reductase-IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase complex. The chemiluminescence of the immunoreactive bands was photographed with Light Capture (model AE-6969N, Atto Instruments, Tokyo, Japan) and quantified using CS Analyzer (version 2.0, Atto Instruments). Proteins were determined by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (26Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Millia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.P. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Immmunohistochemical Localization of OMb and P-45017αin Rat Testis—Testes were excised from adult male rats (Sprague-Dawley) and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution buffered with 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, at 4 °C overnight. Fixed tissues were then dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Three-micron sections were deparaffinized and hydrated using graded alcohol concentrations for standard indirect peroxidase immunohistochemistry. In brief, the preparations were first treated with 0.5% hydrogen peroxide in Na-Pi-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for 20 min at room temperature to block the endogenous peroxidases and then with 5% of normal goat serum in PBS for 20 min at room temperature to block the nonspecific binding. This was followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with the first antibodies against rat OMb or guinea pig P-45017α that had been incubated with 10% normal rat serum for 60 min at 0 °C. The preparations were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat Fab′ fragment to rabbit immunoglobulin G (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Aurora, OH). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) and hydrogen peroxide as described before (27Ogishima T. Suzuki H. Hata J. Mitani F. Ishimura Y. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2971-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Nuclear counterstaining was performed using methyl green (Lab Vision Corp., Fremont, CA). For controls, the first antibody, anti-OMb or anti-P-45017a IgG, was omitted from all procedures described above. The antibody against P-45017α was a generous gift from Dr. S. Kominami of Hiroshima University. Localization of OMb in Rat Testis Cells—The antibodies used in this study are very specific. No cross-reaction between OMb and anti-b5 IgG nor between b5 and anti-OMb IgG was observed if appropriate application of the samples and appropriate dilution of the antibodies were employed. Fig. 1 shows that OMb was distributed between mitochondrial and microsomal fractions almost at a ratio of 1:1 on a protein concentration basis in rat testicular cells, where b5 was not detected. A large amount of the sample loading on the SDS-PAGE scarcely detected the b5 band, which is less than 1/100 that of liver cells. Amounts of OMb present in testes were comparable with those in liver per protein. Dual localization (mitochondria and microsomes) of OMb was also observed in the kidneys and adrenal glands (data not shown). Although localization of OMb in the liver cells had been believed to be strictly the outer mitochondrial membrane, translocation of OMb from there to the microsomal membranes was observed at 12 h after administration of phenobarbital to rats. Because this reagent induces not only CYP2A but also CYP3A families, the amount of CYP3A2 was increased in the microsomal fraction. Translocation of OMb to the microsomes was reproduced with other P-450-inducible agents such as dexamethasone, and pregnenolone-16α-carbonitrile (data not shown). Rat OMb thus has a capability to reside in both the outer mitochondrial and microsomal membranes. In the testicular cells, translocation of OMb as manifested in the liver cells was not observed as tested so far by administration of phenobarbital or dexamethasone. In contrast to OMb, b5 did not change its localization in liver and other cells. Precise results and discussion about the translocation of OMb in liver cells are to be published elsewhere. 2K. Abe, J. Kinoshita, T. Ogishima, and A. Ito, manuscript in preparation. Purification of Enzymes Used in This Study—Fig. 2A shows the purity of the enzyme preparations used in this study. We purified P-45017α from rat testis microsomes and both b5 and P-450 reductase from rat liver microsomes. We mainly used a recombinant OMb because this form had the same effects on rat P-45017α with the native form that was purified from the testis microsomes. Use of the recombinant form allowed us to perform the experiments with a constant and sufficient supply of OMb. The data presented herein were collected by using the recombinant OMb instead of the purified OMb. Guinea pig enzymes were purified from the adrenal glands because the P-45017α, b5, and OMb were probably most abundant in the tissue. The specific content of P-45017α in rat testis microsomes was 0.1 nmol/mg protein as determined from the CO difference spectrum. Contribution of P-450scc, a mitochondrial protein, to the spectrum is negligible for the microsomal preparation as verified from immunoblotting with anti-P-450scc IgG (data not shown). The specific content of P-450 reductase was determined from the results of Fig. 2B to be 1.2 ± 0.3 pmol/mg protein. OMb was present in the testis microsomes at an amount of 0.02–0.05 nmol/mg protein as determined from the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum. The measurement is, however, not accurate in a crude microsomal fraction with limited amounts of b5-type protein. Efficient Electron Transfer Enhances Lyase Activity of P-45017α—By using excess amounts of progesterone as the substrate, we can measure both 17α-hydroxylase and lyase activities simultaneously because P-45017α first converts the steroid to the 17α-hydroxylated intermediate, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and then the second P-450-catalyzed reaction cleaves the C17-C20 bond to give androstenedione without releasing the intermediate. Kinetic studies employing a rapid quenching method proved that androgen formation from progesterone by guinea pig P-45017α and dehydroepiandrosterone formation from pregnenolone by bovine P-45017α proceeded successively (28Tagashira H. Kominami S. Takemori S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10939-10945Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29Yamazaki T. Ohno T. Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Imai T. Kominami S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2800-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the successive reaction, rates of release of the intermediate from the substrate-binding pocket in the enzyme and the C–C bond cleavage together with release of the C17 ketosteroid determine yields of both the 17α-hydroxyl and 17-ketosteroids. Based on this assumption, efficient supply of electrons from P-450 reductase to P-45017α should facilitate the cleavage reaction. This assumption is valid as shown in Fig. 3. Production of androstenedione was increased in a linear fashion with the increase of P-450 reductase added (Fig. 3A). The amount of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone produced, however, was constant in the range tested. These indicate that the first hydroxylation step is relatively fast and that the following steps (i.e. the release of the intermediate and C-C bond cleavage) are rate-limiting as shown previously (28Tagashira H. Kominami S. Takemori S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10939-10945Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The increase of the electron transfer should enhance the second P-450-catalyzed reaction (i.e. C17-C20 bond cleavage) leading to androstenedione formation without affecting the release of the intermediate. The lyase activity was about 1/10th the 17α-hydroxylase activity at a low ratio of P-450 reductase to P-45017α (reductase:P-45017α of 1:100), and it was more than 2.5 times the 17α-hydroxylase activity at a ratio of P-450 reductase to P-45017α of 0.5. Obviously, rat P-45017α has a lyase activity that is higher than the 17α-hydroxylase activity compared with the guinea pig enzyme (see Refs. 28Tagashira H. Kominami S. Takemori S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10939-10945Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and 30Shinzawa K. Kominami S. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 833: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and see the text below). Effects of OMb and b5on 17α-Hydroxylase and Lyase of Rat P-45017α—Addition of OMb to the P-45017α–dependent reaction system enhanced both the 17α-hydroxylase and lyase activities over the range of ratios of P-450 reductase to P-45017α tested. The stimulatory effects, however, tended to be saturated at a low ratio of OMb to P-45017α when the electron transfer was slow due to a low concentration of P-450 reductase (compare the profiles in Fig. 3, B–D). Because the amount of the reductase is very low in the testis microsomes as revealed by immunoblotting with anti-P-450 reductase IgG (Fig. 2B), we hereafter studied the effects of OMb at a ratio of P-450 reductase:P-45017α of 1:50 unless otherwise mentioned. OMb stimulated the 17α-hydroxylase activity linearly at ratios of OMb to P-45017α below 0.1 and continued to increase it gradually up to the ratio of 1.0 to an extent of 7–8-fold (Fig. 4A). Stimulation of the lyase activity was also observed but reached a plateau at a ratio of OMb to P-45017α of about 0.1. Above the molar ratio of OMb:P-45017α of 1.0, the lyase activity was almost constant up to the ratio of 2.0, whereas the 17α-hydroxylase activity continued to increase gradually (data not shown). Maximum stimulation of the lyase activity by OMb was about 3-fold. Addition of b5 to the reaction system containing P-45017α and P-450 reductase also augmented both lyase and 17α-hydroxylase activities but with a manner different than that of OMb (Fig. 4B). It stimulated the lyase activity to an extent similar to that of OMb (3-fold) at ratios of b5 to P-45017α of 0.2–0.5, whereas it enhanced the 17α-hydroxylase activity about twice at the most. At the high ratio, the 17α-hydroxylase and lyase activities dropped to the same value and one-third of the original (without b5) activity, respectively (Fig. 4B), and further decreased above the ratio of 1.0 (data not shown). The differences in the stimulatory effects between OMb and b5 were apparent when the 17α-hydroxylase:lyase activity ratio was plotted in the y axis (Fig. 4C). OMb had a tendency to elevate preferentially the 17α-hydroxylase, whereas b5 stimulated the lyase preferentially. A rise of the 17α-hydroxylase:lyase at a ratio of b5 to P-45017a of 1.0 was due to the strong inhibitory effect on the lyase in a high concentration of b5 relative to P-45017α. Effects of OMb and b5on 17α-Hydroxylase and Lyase of Guinea Pig P-45017α—In general, P-45017α of most animals has strong 17α-hydroxylase and weak lyase activities in the absence of b5 except murine P-45017α. In the guinea pig P-45017α-catalyzed reaction, b5 has been reported to stimulate the lyase activity without significant elevation of the 17α-hydroxylase activity (30Shinzawa K. Kominami S. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 833: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We purified b5 and OMb from microsomes of guinea pig adrenals and analyzed the effects of these proteins toward the P-45017α that had also been purified from the same membrane preparations and embedded in proteoliposomes. Rat b5 greatly stimulated the lyase activity up to a ratio of b5 to guinea pig P-45017α of 0.5 together with slight activation of the 17α-hydroxylase. However, it reduced both activities at the high ratio (Fig. 5B). The stimulatory profile of rat b5 on guinea pig P-45017"

This cis-element consensus sequence is an opportunity for focused analyses of core origin elements and the regulation of initiation of DNA replication. A key to the development of our knowledge about yeast replication origins was the autonomous replicating sequence (ARS) 1The abbreviations used are: ARS, autonomous replicating sequence; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; HH, heavy-heavy; HL, heavy-light; LL, light-light; OBA, origin binding activity; ors, origin-enriched sequence(s).1The abbreviations used are: ARS, autonomous replicating sequence; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; HH, heavy-heavy; HL, heavy-light; LL, light-light; OBA, origin binding activity; ors, origin-enriched sequence(s). assay; genomic fragments cloned into prokaryotic vectors were found to function as yeast replication origins. ARS plasmids transform yeast at a high frequency, replicate autonomously, and can be maintained in vivo as episomal genetic elements (1Stinchcomb D.T. Stuhl K. Davis R.W. Nature. 1979; 282: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). These constructs, however, are lost without selective pressure because of imperfect partition and can integrate into the genome during long term culture. ARS plasmids were invaluable in identifying and defining replication origins in yeast (2Fangman W. Brewer B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 375-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Held P. Heintz N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Progress in understanding other eukaryotic DNA replication, particularly in mammalian cells, has been slower (for review, see Refs. 4Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot.

We report here the identification and testing of a putative consensus sequence that will aid in identification of initiation sites (origins) of DNA replication in mammalian and higher eukaryotic cells. We used four mammalian autonomously replicating sequences containing α-satellite sequence and a reiterative process between pairs of African green monkey and human sequences to minimize derivation of an α-satellite consensus. The resultant consensus sequence was 36 bp. Cloning of a Mixture of Oligonucleotides—A mixture of oligonucleotides was generated using a putative consensus sequence. The oligonucleotides were designed to contain effective primers (T3, T7, and M13 reverse primers) for PCR amplification (e.g. CATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAACAAAAGCTGGGTACC-consensus sequence-TGAGCTCCAATTCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTAC). After PCR amplification, the products were cloned into the SrfI site of pCRscript (Stratagene) for individual variant analysis. A fraction of the ligation reaction mixture was used to transform bacteria (see below) and suggested that there was representation of greater than 100,000 independent clones. To ascertain the minimal essential sequence, a functional assay for “origin” activity was employed. A portion of the ligation mixture was subjected to replication after transfection into HeLa cells (9Nielsen T. Bell D. Lamoureux C. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and in an in vitro replication system (9Nielsen T. Bell D. Lamoureux C. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G. Mol. Gen.

Genet. 1994; 242: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the DpnI-resistant DNA was transfected into bacteria, and individual clones were isolated and sequenced to ascertain whether they contained consensus sequences. CpG Island Clones—Two clones (CP9, HS14C3R Locus; and 6K, HS8F7F Locus) were obtained from the UK HGMP Resource Centre, Cambridge, UK. The sequence homolog in each clone is CATCGAAGCGCTTGAAATCTCCACTTACAAATTCC for CP9, and CCTCAAAGCGCTTGAAAATCTCCACTTGCAAATTCC for 6K. The CpG clones are in the vector pGEM-5Zf(-). Plasmid DNA—All plasmid DNA clones were propagated in bacteria in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and large scale amounts of supercoiled plasmid DNA, essential for autonomous replication assays in vivo and in vitro, were prepared using the Qiagen tip 500 columns according to the manufacturer's specifications (Qiagen). Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Alpha-modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Flow Laboratories). The cultures were maintained in a 37 °C incubator containing an atmosphere of 10% CO2 + air. All normal primary cells (WI38 human embryo lung fibroblasts, bovine embryo kidney fibroblasts, and chicken embryo fibroblasts) were obtained from BioWhittaker and maintained in culture as described for HeLa cells. Drosophila S2 cells were maintained in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum supplemented with glutamine, asparagine, and penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were sealed in Nunc tissue culture flasks and incubated at room temperature in the dark. Transfections were carried out as described previously (12Wu C. Friedlander P. Lamoureux C.

Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were grown for 24 h in medium containing bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd), as described previously (7Landry S. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Wu C. Friedlander P. Lamoureux C. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3340) Google Scholar), loaded onto CsCl gradients (initial refractive index 1.408), and centrifuged as described previously (7Landry S.

Acta. 1993; 1174: 241-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An aliquot of each fraction was either dotor slot-blotted onto a Gene-Screen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), hybridized to 32P-labeled vector (pCRscript or pBluescript) DNA, exposed to an imaging plate, and quantified by densitometry performed using a PhosphorImager (Fuji BAS 2000). In some cases, episomal DNA was recovered by Hirt lysis 3 days after HeLa cells were cotransfected with plasmids containing various versions of the consensus sequence and an expression plasmid carrying the luciferase gene, pRSVLUC (17Popperl H. Featherstone M.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3673-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The low molecular weight DNA was digested with DpnI and then used to transform the DH5α strain of Escherichia coli in a bacterial retransformation assay, as described previously (7Landry S. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 9Nielsen T. Bell D. Lamoureux C. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G. Mol. Gen.

Biochem. 2000; 76: 674-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Some of the transfected HeLa cells were used to determine variations in cell density and efficiency of transfection, by measuring levels of luciferase as described previously (17Popperl H. Featherstone M.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3673-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The levels of luciferase were used to normalize the transformed bacterial colonies detected on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. In some cases, we also used pCMV/β-galactosidase (Applied Biosystems) and a β-galactosidase assay kit (Invitrogen). In Vitro DNA Replication—The cell-free replication assay was adapted from the method described previously (11Pearson C.E. Frappier L. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and as performed previously (18Diaz-Perez M.J. Wainer I.W. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The earliest labeled fragment method was performed using the in vitro DNA replication system, as described previously (11Pearson C.E. Frappier L. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Diaz-Perez M.J. Wainer I.W. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In brief, the in vitro reactions were stopped at 4 and 8 min of incubation, the DNA products were digested with DdeI and PvuII and then separated on a 1.5% agarose gel in 1 × TAE buffer. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImaging plate. Incorporation of [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dTTP into each fragment was quantitated by densitometry of a PhosphorImager screen using the Fuji BAS 2000 analyzer and expressed as incorporation/kb of DNA. Stability of pYACneo Constructs Containing Origins and the A3/4 Consensus Sequence—After transfection of pYACneo (Clontech) constructs, including pYACneo with the A3/4 insert placed at the EcoRI site, clones of HeLa cells that were resistant to G418 were maintained in continuous culture. A fluctuation assay, as described previously (10Nielsen T.O. Cossons N.H. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 674-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), was performed upon six independent HeLa cell clones maintained for more than 40 cell doublings in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. Mutagenesis of A3/4 Version of the Consensus Sequence—The Gene-Morph PCR mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to introduce random mutations in the 36-bp consensus sequence known as A3/4. One of the original clones containing A3/4 in pCRscript was used with T3 and M13 universal primers to prepare the product for ligation into pCRscript at the SmaI site. After transformation of DH5α competent cells (Invitrogen), numerous colonies were isolated and sequenced using the T7 primer in an ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Among more than 100 clones examined, we found 38 variants with one or more mutations in the 36-bp region comprising A3/4 (see Table VI). After identification of these 38 variants, plasmid preparations were made using Qiagen HiSpeed Mini or Midi Kits. Then, an equimolar pool that contained DNA from the 38 variants plus A3/4 was used to transfect HeLa cells, as described above. After isolation of the low molecular weight DNA fraction by Hirt lysis, the DNA was digested with DpnI to remove unreplicated DNA. The digested DNA pool was then used to transform competent bacterial cells, and colonies containing replicated plasmid DNA were isolated. The sequence of plasmid DNA from 60 such clones was obtained using an ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (see Table VI).Table VIMutagenesis and functional assay of A3/4 version of the consensus sequenceMutagenesis SummaryBase No.123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536Consensus sequenceCCTMDAWKSGBYTSMAAWYWBCMYTTRSCAAATTCCA3/4 sequenceCCTCAAATGGTCTCCAATTTTCCTTTGGCAAATTCCAll 38 individualYMTYMRMDRVHMTCHAWTWNWCHKWKTTBWVRKWHMMutations combinedConserved/unchanged******Region unchanged in 10 replicating clones from A3/4 and consensus--TCAAATGGTCTCMAATTWTC--------------Mutated and replicating clonesA3/4, 7 coloniesCCTCAAATGGTCTCCAATTTTCCTTTGGCAAATTCCMut. clone 1, 7 coloniesTAMut. clone 2, 7 coloniesATMut. clone 3, 5 coloniesGMut. clone 4, 5 coloniesAAMut. clone 5, 4 coloniesGTMut. clone 6, 3 coloniesAMut. clone 7, 3 coloniesAGGMut. clone 8, 2 coloniesAMut. clone 9, 2 coloniesACMut. clone 10, 2 coloniesA Open table in a new tab Consensus Sequence Derivation—A consensus sequence was derived from autonomously replicating sequences associated with α-satellite sequences that had been isolated previously from African green monkey CV-1 cells (ors14 and ors23) (7Landry S. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and from autonomously replicating DNA associated with α-satellite sequences (F5 and F20) obtained as anticruciform antibody affinity-purified DNA from normal human skin fibroblasts (9Nielsen T. Bell D. Lamoureux C. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We used a reiterative process between pairs of African green monkey and human sequences to minimize derivation of an α-satellite consensus. We did a comparison of ors14 to F5 and F20, and ors23 to F5 using PILEUP (GCG software) to identify those regions that were useful to use in the generation of a consensus sequence, using CONSENSUS with a certainty level of 75%. Using these four sequences and minimizing α-satellite repetitive sequence, we derived a 36-bp consensus: CCTMDAWKSGBYTSMAAWTWBCMYTTRSCAAATTCC. 2Further details of sequence and method to generate the consensus are available upon request. Nucleotide code: M = A or C; D = A, G, or T; W = A or T; K = G or T; S = C or G; B = C, G, or T; Y = C or T; R = A or G; H = A, C, or T; V = A, C, or G; N = A, C, G, or T. Recovery of Autonomously Replicating Sequences—After synthesis of oligonucleotides containing T3, T7, and M13 reverse primers bracketing the consensus sequence, the mixed pool of oligonucleotides was amplified by PCR using the primers and ligated into pCRscript using the SrfI restriction site. The ligation pool was used in transfection of HeLa cells and as a template in an in vitro DNA replication system using HeLa cell extracts as a source of replication proteins (11Pearson C.E. Frappier L. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). (Previously, we have shown that in this in vitro replication system, initiation is site-specific and maps to the same site as in vivo (8Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Nielsen T.O. Todd A. Price G.B. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Pearson C.E. Frappier L. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochim. Biophys.

Genet. 1994; 20: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).) To eliminate unreplicated DNA, the recovered DNA after transfection into HeLa cells or in vitro replication was digested with DpnI. Then, the pool of DNA products from both replication systems, presumably containing some replicated DpnI-resistant plasmid + consensus inserts, was used to transform competent bacteria and obtain bacterial clones of versions of the consensus sequence capable of autonomous replication. All bacterial clones recovered after selection with ampicillin were found to contain plasmid constructs as identified by agarose gel electrophoresis of plasmid DNA preparations. 17 independent clones were sequenced and shown to contain various versions of the consensus with appropriate flanking sequence. Table I summarizes the consensus sequences recovered. Within the 17 clones, there were found multiple representations of some versions of the consensus; the A3/4 version of the consensus sequence was represented 5 times in this group of 17 clones. When these 17 sequences were compiled to generate another consensus sequence, we derived the same 36-bp consensus used to generate the oligonucleotide mixture used in this study. Only 3 clones, A1, A5, and A39 (Table I), were uniquely represented in the group of 17. We next asked whether the assortment of the 17 sequences could be considered as different from randomly selected clones, i.e. without selection by replication in our in vitro system. We randomly picked and sequenced 8 clones transformed with an aliquot of the same ligation pool, but not subjected to replication in vitro. All 8 clones were found to be unique versions with no multiple representations of any single version. As shown in the Fischer's exact test of autonomously replicating sequences (Table II), the probability that the 17 independent clones recovered after replication in the in vitro system could be attributed to random sampling of the available plasmid + consensus insert versions is unlikely (p = 0.000153). In other words, the library from which autonomously replicating clones were obtained was not limited and did not have any apparent overrepresentation of the replicating clones.Table IRecovery of autonomously replicated sequencesName sequence recovereda36-bp consensus sequence recovered after autonomous replication in HeLa cells.No. timesbNo. of times the sequence was detected from 17 isolates.A3/4CCTCAAATGGTCTCCAATTTTCCTTTGGCAAATTCC5A6CCTAAATTGGTCTGCAAATTGCATTTAGCAAATTCC3A7CCTAGATTGGCTTGAAATTTTCCCTTACCAAATTCC2A15CCTCAATTGGTTTCCAATCAGCATTTAGCAAATTCC2A16CCTCGATGGGTTTGCAAATTCCCCTTAGCAAATTCC2A1CCTAGAAGCGGTTCCAATTTGCATTTAGCAAATTCC1A5CCTCAATTGGTTTCCAAATATCACTTGGCAAATTCC1A39CCTCTAATGGGTTGCAATCTGCATTTAGCAAATTCC1a 36-bp consensus sequence recovered after autonomous replication in HeLa cells.b No. of times the sequence was detected from 17 isolates.

None of the sequences within such regions were 100% similar to the 36-bp consensus. Homologs varied in similarity from 71 to 88% over 21 to 35 bp in initiation regions for c-myc (20Waltz S.E.

More recently, a 79% homology match over 24 bp of the 36-bp consensus sequence was observed at the human lamin B2 origin site and was mapped to the 5′ → 3′ strand at a predicted bidirectional start site, position 3933 (29Abdurashidova G.

Among the most interesting homologs were those present in sequences isolated and characterized as CpG islands (30Cross S.H. Charlton J.A. Nan X. Bird A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). CpG islands are regions of about 1 kb that are GC-rich (65%) and occur in association with promoters of about 50% of all mammalian genes (31Larsen F. Gundersen G. Lopez R. Prydz H.

Antequera F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2426-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) showed that CpG islands are initiation sites for both transcription and DNA replication.

A bidirectional origin of replication was mapped 3′ to the chicken lysozyme locus within a CpG island (37Phi-van L. Stratling W.H.

https://openalex.org/W2117396877,"Muc4/sialomucin complex (SMC) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein complex derived from a single gene that is post-translationally processed into mucin (ASGP-1) and transmembrane (ASGP-2) subunits. Muc4/SMC is tightly regulated in the rat mammary gland, low in the virgin, increased during pregnancy and lactation, and overexpressed in some aggressive mammary tumors. Investigations of primary rat mammary epithelial cells (MEC) have shown that Muc4/SMC expression is post-translationally regulated through inhibition of Muc4/SMC precursor processing by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Localization studies suggest that TGF-β inhibition of Muc4/SMC expression is mediated through SMAD2, a TGF-β effector that, when activated, functions as a transcription factor. SMAD2 antisense oligonucleotide blocks the inhibition of Muc4/SMC expression by TGF-β. The TGF-β effect on Muc4/SMC expression is repressed by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). IFN-γ treatment of MEC activates and relocalizes signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT-1) to induce an inhibitor SMAD, SMAD7. SMAD7 antisense oligonucleotide prevents IFN-γ from blocking the TGF-β inhibition of Muc4/SMC expression. These results suggest that TGF-β regulates Muc4/SMC expression via the SMAD pathway by a transcriptional effect on a protein in the Muc4/SMC processing step, possibly the protease that cleaves the precursor.

Immunocytochemical analyses show the presence of Muc4/SMC in a number of different vulnerable epithelia, including those of the female reproductive tract, airway, ocular surface, and mammary gland (8Carraway K.L. Perez A. Idris N. Jepson S. Arango M. Komatsu M. Haq B. Price-Schiavi S.A. Zhang J. Carraway C.A.C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 149-185Google Scholar). Muc4/SMC has also been studied in both rat and human mammary carcinomas, where its expression appears to be related to tumor aggressiveness (9Price-Schiavi S.A. Jepson S. Li P. Arango M. Rudland P.S. Yee L. Carraway K.L. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 99: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, it is of considerable interest to understand the regulation of Muc4/SMC expression in the mammary gland and its tumors. In previous studies we showed that Muc4/SMC is up-regulated during pregnancy in the rat mammary gland (10Price-Schiavi S.A. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35228-35237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A major factor involved in this regulation appears to be TGF-β (10Price-Schiavi S.A. Carraway C.A.C.

Zhu X. Aquinin R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17800-17807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this inhibitory effect of TGF-β on Muc4/SMC expression is lost in rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells (10Price-Schiavi S.A. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35228-35237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), consistent with the loss of TGF-β responsiveness in many human breast cancers (12Chen T. Carter D. Garrigue-Antar L. Reiss M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4805-4810PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β is a potent inhibitor of a variety of cell types including epithelial, endothelial and hematopoietic cells (13Yue J. Mulder K.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 91: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Many tumor cells, however, become refractory to the inhibitory effects of TGF-β, primarily due to defects in the TGF-β signaling pathway (13Yue J. Mulder K.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 91: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). TGF-β signals through a receptor serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates and activates the transcription factors SMAD2 and SMAD3 (15Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C-H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SMADs can be divided into three classes. The receptor-regulated, or R-SMADs (SMAD2 and SMAD3) can form a heterodimeric complex with a second class, or co-SMAD, of which SMAD4 in the only member. This complex is translocated to the nucleus where it can directly bind to DNA or associate with other transcription factors to regulate transcription. The third class, the inhibitory SMADs, or I-SMAD (SMAD6 and SMAD7), counteract the effect of the R-SMADs, antagonizing TGF-β signaling (13Yue J. Mulder K.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 91: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 15Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C-H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms for regulating I-SMAD effects is via the cytokine IFN-γ (16Ulloa L. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). IFN-γ is the only member of the Type II class of interferons (17Platanias L.C. Fish E.N. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1583-1592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and exerts its biological effects by binding to its cognate receptor, the Type II IFN receptor. The Type II IFN receptor is associated with two tyrosine kinases, Janus kinase-1 and -2. Upon binding of IFN-γ to the receptor, Jak-1 and/or Jak-2 are activated and phosphorylate the Type II IFN receptor. The phosphorylated receptor provides a docking site for a STAT, which then acts as a substrate for Jak (1 or 2) to undergo phosphorylation (17Platanias L.C. Fish E.N. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1583-1592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated STAT forms a homodimer that can translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription (18Moustakas A. Heldin C-H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1867-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). TGF-β and IFN-γ have been shown to have antagonistic effects on cellular functions (16Ulloa L. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 19Ito Y. Zhao J. Mogharei A. Shuler C.F. Weinstein M. Deng C. Chai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44163-44172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that IFN-γ acts on the TGF-β pathway via Jak-1 and STAT-1 to induce SMAD7 expression, which inhibits TGF-β R-SMAD phosphorylation and its downstream events (16Ulloa L. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). In the present study we have characterized the post-translational mechanism involved in the regulation of Muc4/SMC by TGF-β. TGF-β is shown to activate SMAD2, but not SMAD3, in the TGF-β pathway. TGF-β inhibition of Muc4/SMC expression is repressed by IFN-γ. The IFN-γ effect occurs through the up-regulation of SMAD7 via the STAT-1 pathway. These results suggest that TGF-β blocks Muc4/SMC expression through an indirect transcriptional effect, possibly on the enzyme involved in the cleavage of the Muc4/SMC precursor. Materials—Anti-ASGP-2 polyclonal antiserum was prepared against purified ASGP-2. The mouse monoclonal antibody 4F12, which was elicited using purified Muc4/SMC, recognizes an epitope in the N-terminal 53 amino acids of ASGP-2. TGF-β and IFN-γ were purchased from R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis MN). Cell culture materials were obtained from Invitrogen. Phosphorothioate single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Sigma-Genosys (Woodlands, TX). DAPI was purchased from Pierce. SMAD2 and SMAD3 and STAT antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). SMAD7 antibody was ordered from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) supplement was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Primary Cell Culture and Cell Lines—Primary mammary epithelial cells (MEC) were obtained from the mammary glands of 344 Fischer rats (NCI) as described previously (10Price-Schiavi S.A. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35228-35237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin and streptomycin, insulin (10 μg/ml), and EGF (10 ng/ml) or in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin. Dose Responsiveness and Timing Effect of IFN-γ in MEC—To determine dose responsiveness MEC were cultured on plastic dishes in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. After 24 h the medium was replaced with serum-free medium supplemented with ITS, TGF-β (200 pm), and/or IFN-γ at 0, 50, 100, or 200 (ng/ml). To determine the timing effect, cells were treated for 24 h with TGF-β (200 pm) or IFN-γ (100 ng/ml) in serum-free medium supplemented with ITS. After another 24 h IFN-γ (100 ng/ml) was added to the TGF-β treated cultures or TGF-β (200 pm) was added to the IFN-γ treated cultures, and cells were incubated for various times. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-ASGP-2 4F12 and β-actin monoclonal antibodies. Immunofluorescence—MEC were cultured on four-well chamber slides. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 3% FBS/phosphate-buffered saline. Between washes, cells were exposed to each antibody for a period of 1 h. DAPI (1 μg/ml) stain was used to determine nuclear localization. Coverslips were mounted using Prolong antifade (Molecular Probes). Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were electrophoresed under reducing conditions using 8% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin/Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20 (TTBS) for 1 h to overnight and exposed to primary (1 h to overnight) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Pierce) for 1 h in 1% bovine serum albumin/TTBS wash buffer. Signals were detected with the Renaissance™ enhanced chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell Fractionation—Cells were cultured in six-well plates. At 80–90% confluence, cells were treated with either TGF-β and/or IFN-γ for 1 h. Cells were harvested via scraping in cell lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2) with 5 mm EDTA and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cells were allowed to swell for 5 min, homogenized 50×, and centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 5 min to obtain a nuclear fraction. The supernatant fluid, containing both cytosolic and membrane fractions, was centrifuged in a TLA 100.2 rotor at 25000 rpm for 30 min. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in TSE (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA) with the addition of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors, homogenized, and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min and washed two times to obtain nuclei. Cell fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Antisense Inhibiton Assay—Phosphorothioate single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (S-oligos) corresponding to a stretch of 20 nucleotides in the 5′ region of the rat SMAD2 and SMAD7 complementary DNA sequences were synthesized in both sense and antisense orientations. Scrambled oligonucleotide sequences functioned as an additional control. Briefly, cells were cultured to ∼40–50% confluence, at which time cell cultures were treated individually with 50 μm S-oligos (with Oligofectamine reagent, Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free and antibiotic-free medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml ITS supplement. After a 4–6-h incubation period serum was added to the medium, and the cells were allowed to incubate overnight. At 24 h the cells were treated with the appropriate cytokine(s). TGF-β was added to the SMAD2-treated cell cultures. Both TGF-β and IFN-γ were added to the SMAD7-treated cell cultures. No cytokines were added to S-oligo-treated cell cultures used to determine SMAD protein expression. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting and densitometry. Effect of TGF-β and IFN-γ on Muc4/SMC Protein Expression—Muc4/SMC has previously been shown to be regulated by TGF-β post-translationally (10Price-Schiavi S.A. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35228-35237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Price-Schiavi S.A. Zhu X. Aquinin R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17800-17807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The aim of the current study was to define the mechanism previously postulated for post-translational regulation of Muc4/SMC. Previous studies have shown that IFN-γ can interfere with TGF-β effects (16Ulloa L. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 19Ito Y. Zhao J. Mogharei A. Shuler C.F. Weinstein M. Deng C. Chai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44163-44172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To determine whether IFN-γ can block the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on Muc4/SMC expression, we used primary MEC that were cultured in the presence or absence of TGF-β (200 pm) and/or IFN-γ (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. After the 24-h period, cells were harvested and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-ASGP-2 monoclonal antibody, 4F12, which recognizes the membrane subunit of Muc4/SMC protein, and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody as loading control. Immunoblot analysis indicated that Muc4/SMC expression decreases by ∼50% in MEC treated with TGF-β when compared with MEC cultured without TGF-β (Fig. 1). IFN-γ alone had little or no effect on Muc4/SMC expression levels. However, MEC treated both with IFN-γ and TGF-β showed similar levels of Muc4/SMC expression to that of the non-treated MEC, indicating that IFN-γ can repress the TGF-β effect on Muc4/SMC expression. Dose Response of IFN-γ Effect in Normal MEC—IFN-γ was able to block the TGF-β effect on Muc4/SMC at a concentration of 100 ng/ml (see Fig. 1). To determine whether the IFN-γ effect is dose-dependent, MEC were treated with 0, 50, 100, and 200 ng/ml IFN-γ and/or TGF-β (200 pm). After a 24-h period, cells were harvested, lysed, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibodies directed against Muc4/SMC and β-actin. TGF-β, as expected, inhibited Muc4/SMC expression levels by about 50%, while IFN-γ alone had relatively little or no effect on Muc4/SMC levels (Fig. 2). At 50 ng/ml IFN-γ did not block inhibition of Muc4/SMC expression by TGF-β, but at 100 and 200 ng/ml, IFN-γ was able to block the TGF-β effect. These data suggest that blockage of the inhibitory effects of TGF-β on Muc4/SMC expression by IFN-γ is dose-dependent and that the balance of IFN-γ and TGF-β signals may determine the ultimate downstream effect. Timing of TGF-β and IFN-γ Effects on Muc4/SMC Levels— To determine whether the order of addition, or timing of exposure of MEC to TGF-β or IFN-γ, were determining factors in the results obtained, we treated MEC with either TGF-β or IFN-γ for a period of 24 h. After an additional 24 h, TGF-β was added to the IFN-γ-treated MEC and IFN-γ was added to the TGF-β-treated MEC. After an additional incubation for periods up to 24 h, the cells were harvested, lysed, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with 4F12 and β-actin antibodies to determine Muc4/SMC and β-actin expression levels, respectively. When cells were treated with TGF-β first, followed by IFN-γ, Muc4/SMC levels remained similar to those in MEC treated with TGF-β alone (Fig. 3). When cells were treated with IFN-γ first, followed by treatment with TGF-β, Muc4/SMC levels remained high, similar to those in untreated cells or those treated with IFN-γ alone. These data suggest that signaling through the TGF-β and IFN-γ pathway is persistent such that once a signaling pathway is initiated by one factor (either TGF-β or IFN-γ), signaling through the other factor cannot interfere. Relocalization of SMAD2 by TGF-β in MEC—Signaling through TGF-β occurs via transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptor (13Yue J. Mulder K.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 91: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 15Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C-H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which activate receptor-regulated SMADs and induce their translocation to the nucleus. R-SMAD appearance in the nucleus peaks at ∼45 min after TGF-β stimulation and declines after 6 h (20Inman G.J. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). To determine which R-SMAD functions in the TGF-β pathway in normal virgin mammary epithelial cells, MEC were treated with TGF-β for a period of 1 h. Cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer, fractionated, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies for SMAD2 and SMAD3 to observe translocation to the nucleus. Total SMAD2 levels were determined by the addition of the fractions (membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear) in individually treated cultures. When MEC were treated with TGF-β, SMAD2 in the nucleus increased compared with that in control cells; ∼80% of total SMAD2 was found in the nuclear fraction in TGF-β-treated cells. Cells treated with both TGF-β and IFN-γ reversed the effect of the TGF-β, though not completely, yielding a similar pattern of SMAD2 localization as control non-treated MEC. Interestingly, 100% of SMAD2 protein was found in the cytoplasmic fraction when cells were treated with IFN-γ (Fig. 4A). Thus, the nuclear localization of SMAD2 is parallel to the effects on Muc4/SMC expression, though not directly correlated. SMAD3, the other receptor-regulated SMAD in the TGF-β pathway, was not translocated in the presence of TGF-β in MEC (data not shown). To observe activation/translocation of SMAD2 in the cells, MEC were subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. MEC were treated with TGF-β and/or IFN-γ for a period of 1 h. Cells were washed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and probed with anti-SMAD2 or anti-SMAD3 antibodies, followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). Images were observed with an Olympus IX-70 fluorescent microscope. These data correlated with and supported the results obtained in the fractionation study (Fig. 4B). Under all conditions, SMAD3 localization was cytoplasmic (data not shown). STAT-1 Is Relocalized by IFN-γ in MEC—IFN-γ treatment of cells results in phosphorylation of STATs by Jak-1 or -2 associated with the IFN-γ receptor (16Ulloa L. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 21O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 2002; 109: S121-S131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 22Aaronson D.S. Horvath C.M. Science. 2002; 296: 1653-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). To investigate which STAT(s) is activated to regulate TGF-β signaling in MEC, we analyzed STAT activation with antibodies for STATs 1α, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6 to observe and identify STAT proteins activated/translocated in response to IFN-γ stimulation. MEC were treated with or without IFN-γ for a period of 1 h. Cells were washed, fixed, and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis as described previously. No activation of STATs 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6 was observed in MEC when stimulated with IFN-γ (data not shown). STAT localization was primarily cytoplasmic. In contrast, STAT-1α localization to the nucleus in MEC was observed during treatment with IFN-γ (Fig. 5). STAT-1 is considered the primary STAT activated via the Type II IFN receptor (21O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 2002; 109: S121-S131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), which is the cognate receptor for IFN-γ. However, STAT5 and STAT3 are also known to be activated in response to IFN-γ in certain cell types (17Platanias L.C. Fish E.N. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1583-1592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 21O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 2002; 109: S121-S131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Therefore, these data suggest that STAT-1α functions as the primary STAT effector in IFN-γ-stimulated MEC and suggest a role in the regulation of Muc4/SMC via the TGF-β-stimulated pathway. Requirement for SMAD2 in the Post-translational Regulation of Muc4/SMC by TGF-β—To determine the requirement for SMAD2 in the regulation of Muc4/SMC by TGF-β, we utilized antisense technology (23Monteleone G. Kumberova A. Croft N.M. McKenzie C. Steer H.W. MacDonald T.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 24He W. Li A.G. Wang D. Han S. Zheng B. Goumans M-J.

Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 26Heasman J. Rev. Dev. Biol. 2002; 243: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). S-oligos corresponding to a stretch of 20 nucleotides in the 5′ region of the rat SMAD2 complementary DNA sequence were synthesized in both sense and antisense orientations. A scrambled oligonucleotide sequence functioned as an additional control. Cells were cultured to 40–50% confluence, at which time cell cultures were treated individually with 50 μm of the oligonucleotides (with Oligofectamine reagent) in serum-free and antibiotic-free medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml of ITS. After a 4–6-h incubation period serum was added to the medium and allowed to incubate for a total of 24 h. No cytokines were added to S-oligo-treated cell cultures used to determine SMAD2 protein expression. SMAD2 antisense S-oligo-treated cell cultures had a reduction of ∼70%, in SMAD2 protein expression as compared with SMAD2 sense and scrambled S-oligo-treated cell cultures (Fig. 6A). The results indicate that the SMAD2 S-oligos function as expected. To determine the requirement for SMAD2 in the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on Muc4/SMC expression, we treated the cell cultures with TGF-β for a period of 24 h after the initial 24-h incubation with the S-oligos. This method allows us to determine whether Muc4/SMC protein expression persists when treated with both TGF-β and the SMAD2 antisense S-oligo. If SMAD2 is required for TGF-β inhibition of Muc4/SMC, then blocking SMAD2 expression will prevent TGF-β from down-regulating Muc4/SMC expression. We observed an 80% reduction in Muc4/SMC expression in cell cultures treated with the SMAD2 sense and scrambled S-oligo, compared with SMAD2 antisense-treated cell cultures (Fig. 6B). β-Actin was used to control for protein loading. The results indicate that TGF-β was not able to inhibit Muc4/SMC expression when SMAD2 expression was blocked by the antisense method. When SMAD2 expression was not blocked (sense and scrambled S-oligo), TGF-β suppressed Muc4/SMC expression. These data support the requirement for SMAD2 activation in regulating Muc4/SMC expression via the TGF-β-SMAD pathway (11Price-Schiavi S.A. Zhu X. Aquinin R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17800-17807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Requirement for SMAD7 in the Post-translational Regulation of Muc4/SMC by IFN-γ—SMAD6 and SMAD7 are inhibitors of TGF-β family signaling. While SMAD7 inhibits both TGF-β and bone morphogenic protein-mediated SMAD signaling, SMAD6 is specific for bone morphogenic proteins. Studies by Massague and co-workers (16Ulloa L. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) have implicated SMAD7 in the effects of IFN-γ on the TGF-β mechanism. The mechanism by which IFN-γ blocks the TGF-β suppression of Muc4/SMC expression predicts expression of SMAD7 and formation of a SMAD7-TGF-β receptor complex, which is known to block SMAD2/3 activation. Based on these studies and others, we proposed that TGF-β can block Muc4/SMC synthesis via the SMAD pathway and that this repression can be reversed by IFN-γ via the Jak/STAT pathway and up-regulation of Smad7. Similar to our SMAD2 antisense studies, we analyzed the effectiveness of the SMAD7 phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. Cell cultures were treated individually with SMAD7 antisense, sense, and scrambled S-oligos at a concentration of 50 μm for a period of 24–48 h. To determine the effectiveness of the SMAD7 antisense S-oligo to block SMAD7 expression, we omitted the use of cytokines. After the specified period, cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti-SMAD7 polyclonal antibody. As expected, the SMAD7 antisense S-oligo-treated cell cultures had a marked reduction of 55–60% in SMAD7 protein expression compared with SMAD7 sense and scrambled S-oligo-treated cell cultures (Fig. 7A). These results indicate that the SMAD7 antisense S-oligo functioned to block SMAD7 protein expression. To determine the requirement for SMAD7 in blocking the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on Muc4/SMC expression, cell cultures were treated with TGF-β and IFN-γ for a period of 24 h after the initial 24-h incubation with the S-oligo. This method required that both cytokines (TGF-β and IFN-γ) be present as opposed to the use of TGF-β alone in the SMAD2 antisense studies. If SMAD7 is required to block the TGF-β effect, we would expect reduced levels of Muc4/SMC protein expression in the presence of the SMAD7 antisense S-oligo. That is, the presence of TGF-β, as shown previously, would reduce the levels of Muc4/SMC protein expression, but if IFN-γ is simultaneously present, SMAD7 would be activated to block the effect of TGF-β. In our analyses we observed a 36% reduction in Muc4/SMC expression in SMAD7 antisense S-oligo-treated cell cultures compared with SMAD7 sense and scrambled S-oligo-treated cell cultures (Fig. 7B). The results indicate that TGF-β was able to inhibit Muc4/SMC expression in the presence of IFN-γ when SMAD7 expression was blocked by the antisense method. When SMAD7 expression was not blocked (sense and scrambled S-oligos), TGF-β suppression of Muc4/SMC expression was not observed (compared with SMAD7 antisense S-oligo-treated cell cultures). These data indicate a requirement for SMAD7 in regulating the post-translational effect of TGF-β on Muc4/SMC expression via the IFN-γ-Jak-STAT pathway. Muc4/SMC is developmentally regulated in the rat mammary gland, dramatically increasing its levels of expression in the lactating mammary gland compared with the virgin mammary gland, while decreasing again during mammary gland involution (10Price-Schiavi S.A.

Deviation from this regulatory mechanism can have adverse effects on the mammary gland, possibly propagating a cascade of deleterious events leading to neoplasia and tumor progression. Muc4/SMC has been shown to increase the potential for tumor growth (27Komatsu M. Jepson S. Arango M.E. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway K.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and metastasis (28Komatsu M. Tatum L. Altman N.H. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway K.L. Int. J.

To elucidate the mechanism of action and factors that are involved in regulating expression of Muc4/SMC, we utilized primary cell cultures of rat mammary epithelial cells that are believed to mimic the in vivo state. Previously, TGF-β was demonstrated to affect Muc4/SMC expression via a post-transcriptional mechanism (10Price-Schiavi S.A. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35228-35237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Additional studies have shown that TGF-β regulation of Muc4/SMC did not affect Muc4/SMC precursor synthesis or its rate of turnover. Instead, it was shown to interfere with the processing of Muc4/SMC precursor to its mature form of ASGP-1/ASGP-2 (11Price-Schiavi S.A. Zhu X. Aquinin R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17800-17807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting a post-translational mechanism of action. In the current studies, we have furthered our understanding of TGF-β regulation of Muc4/SMC by showing that SMAD2, and not SMAD3, is activated in MEC in response to TGF-β (Fig. 4). SMAD2 was shown to translocate to the nucleus utilizing two methods: cell fractionation and immunocytochemistry. In addition, the requirement for SMAD2 activation in the regulation of Muc4/SMC expression was supported with the use of antisense technology (Fig. 6). Various other growth factors and cytokines have been tested to determine their effects on Muc4/SMC expression. In addition to TGF-β, IFN-γ was shown to be involved in regulating Muc4/SMC expression. IFN-γ was observed to block the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on Muc4/SMC expression, and this effect was shown to be dose responsive (Fig. 2). A previous study by Ulloa et al. (16Ulloa L. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) integrated the TGF-β and IFN-γ signaling pathways. IFN-γ was shown to block TGF-β SMAD3 phosphorylation and activation by activating SMAD7 via the JAK-STAT-1 pathway. To determine which STAT was activated in MEC upon IFN-γ stimulation, we screened STAT activation with monoclonal antibodies directed at STATs 1–6. IFN-γ is known to activate STATs 1, 3, 5a, and 5b (17Platanias L.C. Fish E.N. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1583-1592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 21O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 2002; 109: S121-S131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that STAT-1 is the primary target of IFN-γ (21O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 2002; 109: S121-S131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). STATs 2–6 were not activated in our experiments in MEC. However, STAT-1 was activated in response to IFN-γ (Fig. 5). This result suggested that STAT-1 plays a role in the regulation of Muc4/SMC expression. Additionally, SMAD7 was selected as a possible candidate in mediating the IFN-γ signal and regulating the TGF-β induced inhibition of Muc4/SMC expression (17Platanias L.C. Fish E.N. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1583-1592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 19Ito Y. Zhao J. Mogharei A. Shuler C.F. Weinstein M. Deng C. Chai Y. J. Biol.

The results of this study provide a clearer model of Muc4/SMC post-translational regulation by TGF-β and IFN-γ in the MEC (Fig. 8). Our model indicates that Muc4/SMC protein expression in MEC is inhibited post-translationally by the TGF-β pathway. Upon binding of TGF-β to its cognate receptor, SMAD2 is phosphorylated and activated by the TGF-β receptor via its intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activity. SMAD2 then forms a complex with co-SMAD4 and is translocated to the nucleus (14Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 15Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C-H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where it functions as a transcription factor to regulate gene expression of an unknown factor involved in Muc4/SMC precursor processing. The TGF-β-SMAD2 signaling pathway is blocked by activation of the IFN-γ Type II receptor, which functions to activate associated Jak tyrosine kinases that recruit STAT-1 by providing a docking site. STAT-1 serves as a substrate for Jak kinase activity. STAT-1 is activated, homodimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus to regulate transcription of the inhibitory SMAD7. SMAD7 then functions to block activation of SMAD2 and, therefore, blocks TGF-β signaling. The timing and concentration of the individual factors (TGF-β and IFN-γ) may determine the fate of Muc4/SMC expression. This study raises other questions regarding the post-translational regulation of Muc4/SMC in the mammary gland by TGF-β and IFN-γ. An unknown factor is regulated by the TGF-β pathway that results in altering the processing of the precursor Muc4/SMC to its mature form. Processing of the Muc4/SMC precursor is known to involve a proteolytic cleavage, which in addition to glycosylation, results in the maturation of pMuc4/SMC to ASGP-1 and ASGP-2. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that TGF-β may negatively regulate an enzyme that either cleaves the pMuc4/SMC or is involved in modifying the cleavage site. Presently, a study is under way to investigate these possibilities. Preliminary experiments with various protease inhibitors seem to indicate the involvement of a proteolytic enzyme in this process. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in regulating Muc4/SMC expression is key to determining the role of Muc4/SMC in other processes, particularly its role in tumor progression and metastasis."

Polyclonal IgG from healthy donors formed covalent adducts with a positively charged hapten CRA at levels superior to trypsin. Each of the 16 single chain Fv clones studied expressed a similar reactivity, indicating the V domain location of the nucleophiles and their broad distribution in diverse Abs. The formation of hapten CRA-Fv adducts was correlated with Fv proteolytic activity determined by cleavage of a model peptide substrate. Despite excellent nucleophilicity, proteolysis by IgG proceeded at lower rates than trypsin, suggesting that events occurring after nucleophilic attack on the substrate limit the rate of Ab proteolysis. The extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor with phosphonate diester groups at Lys side chains and a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 421– 431 of human immunodeficiency virus glycoprotein (gp) 120 with the phosphonate diester at the C terminus formed covalent adducts with specific polyclonal and monoclonal Abs raised by immunization with epidermal growth factor receptor and synthetic gp120-(421– 436) devoid of phosphonate diester groups, respectively. Adduct formation was inhibited by extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (exEGFB) and synthetic gp120-(421– 436) devoid of phosphonate groups, suggesting that the nucleophiles are located within the antigen binding sites.

The underlying assumption has been that Abs interact with their ligands exclusively by non-covalent means. Initial indications that natural Abs express chemical reactivity indistinguishable from enzymes came from reports of proteolytic and nuclease activity of autoantibodies (3Paul S. Volle D.J. Beach C.M. Johnson D.R. Powell M.J. Massey R.J. Science. 1989; 244: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 4Shuster A.M. Gololobov G.V. Kvashuk O.A. Bogomolova A.E. Smirnov I.V.

A. 1993; 90: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). From mutagenesis and inhibitor studies, it appears that the proteolytic activity of natural Abs originates from nucleophilic mechanisms similar to those utilized by conventional serine proteases (10Gao Q.-S. Sun M. Rees A. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Paul S. Tramontano A. Gololobov G. Zhou Y.-X. Taguchi H. Karle S. Nishiyama Y. Planque S. George S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28314-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of natural Abs could be construed to violate the principles of B cell clonal selection theory. Antigen-specific Abs develop over the course of the immune response by sequence diversification of germ line genes encoding the V domains followed by selective antigen binding by B cell receptors with the greatest affinity, which stimulates clonal proliferation. Catalysis entails chemical transformation of the antigen and release of products (surface immunoglobulins associated with Igα and Igβ subunits), which is predicted to result in the cessation of B cell selection. Therefore, adaptive selection of Ab catalytic activity may be a disfavored event. For this reason, catalysis by naturally occurring Abs is often assumed to be a molecular accident arising from sequence variability of the V domains as opposed to a general phenomenon with functional implications. The foregoing restrictions do not apply to the initial step in the catalytic cycle of serine proteases. In analogy with conventional enzymes, a nucleophile belonging to a proteolytic Ab (Fig 1A, Nu) is conceived to initiate nucleophilic attack on the antigen following the formation of the non-covalent ground state complex. Adaptive development of Ab nucleophilicity is fully compatible with B cell clonal selection if the outcome is the formation of a covalent acyl-Ab complex as occupancy of the B cell receptor will be maintained. Whether the catalytic cycle is completed depends on the efficiency of hydrolysis of the acyl-Ab complex and release of the product. Recently, hapten phosphonate esters have been developed as probes for covalent binding to the active site nucleophiles in Abs displaying serine protease and serine esterase activity (11Paul S. Tramontano A. Gololobov G. Zhou Y.-X. Taguchi H. Karle S. Nishiyama Y. Planque S. George S. J. Biol.

These compounds can be applied for direct study of Ab chemical activity independent of additional activities needed for accomplishment of catalysis. In addition, the phosphonates can be placed within peptides and proteins (Fig. 1, B and C) for studying the interplay between Ab nucleophilic reactivity and non-covalent forces permitting specific recognition of individual polypeptides. We describe here observations suggesting the broad distribution of nucleophilic reactivity in IgG and recombinant Fv preparations at levels exceeding that of the conventional serine protease trypsin. Originally prepared as probes for catalytic Abs, CRA analogs of EGFR and an HIV gp120-synthetic peptide were observed to form covalent adducts with ordinary Abs raised by immunization with antigens devoid of the phosphonate groups, suggesting that adaptive maturation processes favor the expression of nucleophilic reactivity. These observations argue for Ab nucleophilicity as a force responsible for shaping the expressed Ab repertoire and suggest novel routes toward permanent inactivation of Abs. Abs—Human polyclonal IgG was prepared by affinity chromatography on protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) from the sera of six healthy human subjects (laboratory codes 1086, 1087, 1088, 1091, 1092, and 1518). IgG from pooled serum from eight BALB/c mice (4–5 weeks) was obtained similarly.

CRA II was prepared by condensation of diphenylamino(phenyl)methanephosphonate (compound a) and 6-biotinamidohexanoic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) as described for CRA I. For the preparation of CRA III, compound a (160 mg, 0.34 mmol) was treated with 30% hydrogen bromide/CH3COOH (5 ml).

After removing solvent under reduced pressure, the residue was extracted with CH2Cl2 (50 ml) and the extract was washed with water (5 ml × 3), dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated to dryness. The yellowish oily residue was dissolved in diethyl ether (30 ml).

Nishiyama Y. Zhou Y.-X. Luo J. Planque S. Hanson C. Paul S. Vaccine. 2003; 21: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CRA V was conjugated to BSA (20 ng of peptide-CRA equivalent/well), exEGFR (200 ng/well), or exEGFR-CRA V (200 ng of protein equivalent/well) in 100 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.6, for 2 h. ELISA procedures were essentially as described previously (13Karle S. Nishiyama Y. Zhou Y.-X. Luo J. Planque S. Hanson C. Paul S. Vaccine. 2003; 21: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Bound murine IgG was detected with goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1000, specific for the constant domain of the heavy chain, Sigma). Irreversible CRA Binding—Following incubation of biotinylated CRAs with Abs or trypsin (porcine, type IX, Sigma) in 50 mm Tris, HCl, 100 mm glycine, 0.1 mm CHAPS, pH 7.7, at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were boiled (5 min) in 2% SDS and subjected to SDS-PAGE (4–20%, Bio-Rad, or 8–25% Phast gels, Amersham Biosciences). Electroblotting and biotin detection procedures using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and a chemiluminescent substrate (Supersignal, Pierce) have been described previously (11Paul S. Tramontano A. Gololobov G. Zhou Y.-X. Taguchi H. Karle S. Nishiyama Y. Planque S. George S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28314-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Imaging and quantification was on x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) using Unscan-it software (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT) or Fluoro-STM MultiImager (Bio-Rad). Band intensities are expressed in arbitrary area units (AAU). Valid comparisons of band intensities from different experiments is not possible because exposure and development times were not held constant. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) (Sigma) was kept at 4 °C until used. In some experiments, biotinylated BSA (8 mol of biotin/mol protein, Pierce) was electrophoresed at several concentrations in parallel with the samples and the biotin content of the CRA adducts was determined. Pseudo-first order rate constants (kobs) were computed from reaction progress curves by fitting to the equation Bt = Bmax(1 - exp(-kobst)), where Bt represents adduct concentration at various times and Bmax represents the initial Ab concentration. Immunoblotting with goat anti-mouse IgG Abs was as described previously (7Paul S. Sun M. Mody R. Tewary H.K. Stemmer P. Massey R.J. Gianferrara T. Mehrotra S. Dreyer T. Meldal M. Tramontano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13142-13145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolysis Assay—Catalytic activity was measured by fluorimetric determination (λex 360 nm, λem 470 nm; Varian Cary Eclipse) of the cleavage of amide bond linking aminomethylcoumarin to the C-terminal amino acid in short peptide-MCA substrates (Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA, Boc-Glu-Ala-Arg-MCA, and Boc-Ile-Glu-Ala-Arg-MCA (200 μm), Peptide International) (10Gao Q.-S. Sun M. Rees A. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Catalysts were incubated with peptide-MCA substrates in 50 mm Tris HCl, 0.1 m glycine, 0.025% Tween 20, pH 8.0, at 37 °C in 96-well plates. In some assays, a comparison of IgG and trypsin proteolytic activity was done in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.137 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CHAPS. Authentic aminomethylcoumarin (Peptide International) was used to construct a standard curve from which product release was computed in molar values. Ab Nucleophilicity Identified with Hapten CRAs—Phosphonate hapten CRAs I-III (Fig. 1) are analogs of known active site-directed inhibitors of serine proteases (19Oleksyszyn J. Powers J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 423-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similar to the serine protease trypsin, IgG from a healthy human subject formed adducts with CRA I that were resistant to boiling and the denaturant SDS (Fig. 2, IgG, 150-kDa adducts; trypsin, 21-kDa adducts). Pooled IgG from immunologically unmanipulated BALB/c mice formed similar CRA I adducts. The positively charged amidino group in CRA I was originally incorporated in this compound to allow selective recognition of trypsin, which displays preference for basic residues at the P1 site (the residue immediately adjacent to the cleavage site in peptide substrates) (for review see Ref. 20Oleksyszyn J. Boduszek B. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). CRA II lacks the positively charged amidino group adjacent to the covalently reactive phosphorus atom. IgG was 240-fold less reactive with CRA II than with CRA I, suggesting the trypsin-like P1 specificity of Abs. CRA III, which contains a weaker leaving group than CRA II did not form detectable adducts with IgG (the presence of methoxy-leaving groups reduces the electrophilicity of the phosphorus atom, and methoxy-containing phosphonate diesters are reported to bind weakly with certain serine proteases) (for review see Ref. 21Zhao Q. Kovach I.M. Bencsura A. Papathanassiu A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8128-8138Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Increasing formation of covalent CRA I adducts with IgG and trypsin was evident as a function of reaction time (Fig. 2B). The velocity of the reaction for IgG was 14.5-fold greater than for trypsin measured under identical conditions (172.7 ± 14.2 and 11.9 ± 0.6 AAU/min, respectively, from linear regression of Fig. 2B data). Assuming that hydrolysis of the phosphonylated-protein complex is equivalent (see reaction schemes in Fig. 1), it may be concluded that the nucleophilic efficiency of IgG is superior to that of trypsin. IgG preparations from healthy humans and immunologically unmanipulated mice have been documented to cleave small model peptide substrates on the C-terminal side of basic residues. The cleavage activity was observed in each of several IgG preparations examined. The activity co-migrated with intact 150-kDa IgG in denaturing gel filtration studies, and it was expressed by Fab (fragment antigen binding) preparations made by papain digestion (22Kalaga R. Li L. O'Dell J.R. Paul S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2695-2702PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we compared the proteolytic activity of trypsin and IgG from a healthy human subject (the same preparation as in nucleophilicity studies illustrated in Fig. 2). With Glu-Ala-Arg-MCA and Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA substrates, initial rates of proteolysis by IgG were, respectively, 1.8 × 105- and 6.8 × 105-fold smaller than by trypsin (Fig. 3, A and B, determined from the slopes of the progress curves). Glu-Ala-Arg-MCA is the preferred substrate for trypsin. Glu-Ala-Arg-MCA and Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA are the preferred substrates for human IgG determined from previous screening of a panel of peptide-MCA substrates (22Kalaga R. Li L. O'Dell J.R. Paul S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2695-2702PubMed Google Scholar). The magnitude of proteolysis by this IgG preparation falls within the range reported previously for other human IgG preparations. Despite its superior nucleophilic reactivity, the IgG is evidently a poor catalyst compared with trypsin. CRA I and DFP (another active site-directed inhibitor of serine proteases) inhibited the catalytic activity of IgG-catalyzed peptide-MCA cleavage (Fig. 3C), and DFP inhibited the irreversible binding of CRA I by the IgG (by 95%). These results provide assurance that CRA I binds the catalytic sites of IgG. As DFP binds the active site of serine proteases, its inhibitory effect confirms the serine protease character of the CRA I binding sites of IgG. Electrophoresis of CRA I-IgG adducts under reducing conditions revealed labeling of both subunits by the hapten CRA, evident as biotin-containing bands at 50-kDa heavy chain bands and 25-kDa light chain bands (Fig. 3D). Irreversible CRA I binding activity of IgG was lost by preheating the protein at 60 °C for 10 min, indicating the dependence of the nucleophilic reactivity on the native protein conformation. Each of the five polyclonal IgG preparations from healthy humans displayed irreversible binding to CRA I (Table I). Each of 16 randomly picked scFv clones from a human library formed CRA I-adducts (see example in Fig. 4A), indicating the V domain location of the binding site and suggesting that the nucleophilic reactivity is a shared property of diverse Abs. 91% of the total protein available in Fv MM-F4 shown in Fig 4A (GenBank™ accession number AF522073) displayed nucleophilic reactivity (computed as mol biotin/mol Fv protein in the 27-kDa CRA I adduct band; Fv valency 1; reaction conditions as shown in Fig. 4). Analyzed by electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions, some scFv reaction mixtures contained CRA I adducts at 55–90 kDa in addition to the monomer scFv adducts at 27 kDa. All of the CRA-adduct bands were also stainable with Ab to c-Myc, confirming the presence of scFv in the adducts (the recombinant proteins contain a 10-residue c-Myc peptide) (10Gao Q.-S. Sun M. Rees A. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The tendency of scFv to form aggregates has been reported previously (23Whitlow M. Bell B.A. Feng S.L. Filpula D. Hardman K.D. Hubert S.L. Rollence M.L. Wood J.F. Schott M.E. Milenic D.E. Yokota T. Schlom J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Diminished levels of CRA I-adducts were detected when an scFv clone was treated with DFP prior to CRA I treatment (by 72%). The rate of covalent adduct formation by different Fv clones was variable over a 34-fold range (Table I), indicating distinct levels of nucleophilic reactivity of different Abs. The reactivity of the five polyclonal IgG samples, which represent mixtures of different Abs, was less variable (by 5.4). A comparison of the peptide-MCA cleaving activity (Glu-Ala-Arg-MCA substrate) and irreversible CRA I binding by the scFv clones indicated a strong correlation (p < 0.005, r2 = 0.77) (Fig. 4B), confirming the functional importance of superior nucleophilic reactivity.Table IBroad distribution of hapten I-irreversible binding by antibodiesAntibodyHapten I-irreversible binding, AAU × 103/μm proteinMean ± S.D.MedianRangeNHuman serumIgG33.7 ± 20.430.112.4-67.15scFv928 ± 688105055-190016 Open table in a new tab Specific Covalent Binding of Peptidyl and Protein CRA— Protein CRA IV and peptide CRA Va were analyzed to assess"

Our goal was to map the uPAR binding site of the Man-6-P/IGF2R by analyzing the uPAR binding characteristics of a panel of minireceptors containing different regions of the Man-6-P/IGF2R extracytoplasmic domain. Coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that soluble recombinant uPAR (suPAR) bound the Man-6-P/IGF2R at two distinct sites, one localized to the amino-terminal end of the Man-6-P/IGF2R extracytoplasmic domain (repeats 1–3) and the other to the more carboxyl-terminal end (repeats 7–9). These sites correspond with the positions of the two Man-6-P binding domains of Man-6-P/IGF2R. Indeed, the suPAR-Man-6-P/IGF2R interaction was inhibited by Man-6-P, and binding-competent su-PAR species represented a minor percentage (8–30%) of the suPAR present. In contrast, Man-6-P/IGF2R binding of endogenous, full-length uPAR solubilized from plasma membranes of the prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, was not inhibited by Man-6-P. Further studies showed that very little (<5%) endogenous uPAR was Man-6-P/IGF2R binding-competent. We conclude that, contrary to previous reports, the interaction between uPAR and Man-6-P/IGF2R is a low percentage binding event and that suPAR and full-length uPAR bind the Man-6-P/IGF2R by different mechanisms.

The extracytoplasmic region consists of 15 homologous repeats ∼147 residues in length (1Dahms N.M. Hancock M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 317-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Separate regions in the receptor's extracytoplasmic domain have been shown to interact with two classes of ligands, insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) and proteins that contain a Man-6-P marker as a result of post-translational modification (2Dahms N.M.

Mapping studies have shown that these ligands bind to distinct regions of the extracytoplasmic domain. The IGF-II binding site has been localized to repeat 11, with higher affinity conferred by cooperation with repeat 13 (4Dahms N.M. Wick D.A. Brzycki-Wessell M.A. J. Biol.

These separate binding functions contribute to the various cellular functions ascribed to the Man-6-P/IGF2R, which controls the local concentration of IGF-II at the cell surface by internalizing IGF-II and targeting it for degradation in lysosomes (3Braulke T. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The Man-6-P binding function of the receptor is involved in the transport of lysosomal enzymes from the Golgi to the prelysosomal compartment and in the endocytosis of extracellular phosphomannosyl ligands from the cell surface (2Dahms N.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Braulke T. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Man-6-P binding also contributes to the activation of Man-6-P-containing precursor forms of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)by binding pro-TGF-β, which is subsequently cleaved to allow release of the active growth factor (3Braulke T.

Several years ago, the Man-6-P/IGF2R was reported to bind uPAR via a novel interaction that was not inhibited by either Man-6-P or IGF-II (27Nykjaer A. Christensen E.I. Vorum H. Hager H.

Binding of uPAR to the Man-6-P/IGF2R was found to be a low affinity interaction (KD ∼11 μm) with a binding stoichiometry of ∼1 mol of uPAR/mol of Man-6-P/IGF2R (27Nykjaer A. Christensen E.I. Vorum H.

Recently, the binding site on the Man-6-P/IGF2R for uPAR was mapped to the first half of repeat 1 in the extracytoplasmic domain (29Leksa V. Godár S. Cebecauer M. Hilgert I. Breuss J. Weidle U.H.

Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7842-7847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attaches the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain of uPAR to the cell membrane (32Ploug M. Rønne E. Behrendt N. Jensen A.L. Blasi F. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1926-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding of uPAR to its ligand, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), inactive pro-uPA is proteolytically cleaved and thereby activated (33Ellis V. Scully M.F. Kakkar V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2185-2188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of active uPAR-bound uPA, a serine protease, is proteolytic conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, another serine protease (34Stoppelli M.P. Tacchetti C. Cubellis M.V. Corti A.

Thus, by binding uPA, uPAR regulates cell migration and tissue remodeling processes as well as pericellular proteolysis (31Behrendt N. Ploug M. Patthy L. Houen G. Blasi F. Danø K. J. Biol.

Currently, the functional significance of the binding between uPAR and the Man-6-P/IGF2R is unclear. Three possible roles have been proposed involving control of cell surface uPAR expression, TGF-β activation, or uPAR-mediated functions such as fibrinolysis, cell adhesion, and migration (27Nykjaer A.

To this end, a panel of Man-6-P/IGF2R minireceptors containing portions of the extracytoplasmic domain was used in coimmunoprecipitation with soluble uPAR. Studies with soluble recombinant uPAR, truncated after Arg281 to delete the glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage site, revealed that suPAR binds the receptor in a bivalent manner corresponding to the same repeat regions as the Man-6-P binding sites. Subsequent studies showed that suPAR binds the Man-6-P/IGF2R at two separate sites in the extracytoplasmic domain and that the interaction is sensitive to Man-6-P under all conditions tested. Further, we investigated the interaction between the Man-6-P/IGF2R and full-length endogenous uPAR extracted from plasma membrane preparations of PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. Pull-down assays of membrane extract proteins and immobilized Man-6-P/IGF2R demonstrated that only a small percentage of endogenous uPAR bound the Man-6-P/IGF2R and that the binding was not inhibited by Man-6-P. Attempts to coimmunoprecipitate endogenous uPAR with the Man-6-P/IGF2R minireceptors were unsuccessful. We conclude that the interactions between full-length uPAR and suPAR with the Man-6-P/IGF2R are of low abundance and that they bind the Man-6-P/IGF2R by differing mechanisms. Materials—d-Man-6-P disodium salt, d-glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P), the α-FLAG M2 antibody, and α-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel reagents were purchased from Sigma. Radiolabeled pentamannose phosphate-bovine serum albumin (PMP-BSA) and unlabeled PMP-BSA were prepared as described previously (22Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. de Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol.

Radiolabeled suPAR was prepared by iodination using precoated IODOGEN® tubes (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's specifications to a specific activity of 2.82 Ci/μg. Purified full-length and soluble forms of bovine Man-6-P/IGF2R were prepared as previously described (38Byrd J.C. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol.

Russell (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) (39Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 8.6-kilobase pair human Man-6-P/IGF2R cDNA was a gift of Dr. William S. Sly (St. Louis University Medical Center, St. Louis, MO) (40Oshima A. Nolan C.M. Kyle J.W. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2553-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified suPAR and the α-uPAR polyclonal antibodies were prepared as described before (41Mizukami I.F. Garni-Wagner B.A. DeAngelo L.M. Liebert M. Flint A. Lawrence D.A. Cohen R.L. Todd III, R.F.

The recombinant soluble uPAR was affinity-purified from the culture medium of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transfected with suPAR cDNA. The uPAR was purified at a concentration of 1.13 mg/ml with Sepharose conjugated to the amino-terminal fragment of uPA. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies (clones 2 and 3) were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. The uPAR monoclonal antibody clone 3 was obtained from Monozyme (Copenhagen, Denmark).

Preparation, Expression, and Analysis of Epitope-tagged Soluble Minireceptors—The truncated Man-6-P/IGF2R minireceptors 1–3F, 1–8F, 1–15F, 7–9F, and 7–15F were tagged with the eight-residue FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) at the carboxyl terminus and cloned into the pCMV5 vector as previously described (37Byrd J.C.

The construct 1–15F, formerly called 15F (22Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. de Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), will be identified as 1–15F throughout this paper to clarify that this construct contains all 15 extracytoplasmic repeats but lacks the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The 11F construct was engineered in the pCMV5RIX expression vector using a strategy previously described (42Garmroudi F. Devi G. Slentz D.H. Schaffer B.S. MacDonald R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 642-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 1F construct was synthesized in a similar manner. Using the full-length Man-6-P/IGF2R cDNA as a template, 1F was amplified with VentTM polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) by incorporating the FLAG epitope and using primer pairs targeted to the region of interest, extracytoplasmic repeat 1 (nucleotides (nt) 148–639, corresponding to residues 1–164). To make the 11Fsp construct lacking the first half of repeat one but containing the signal sequence, a cDNA fragment encompassing nt 94–267 of the Man-6-P/IGF2R cDNA was cloned into pCMV5. This region includes sequences encoding the signal sequence and 63 nt of the 5′-untranslated region followed by an EcoRI site. This vector, pCMV5sp, was generated by VentTM polymerase amplification of the human Man-6-P/IGF2R cDNA with a 5′-primer containing an XhoI site followed by sequence corresponding to nt 94–113 and a 3′-primer complementary to nt 277–291 followed by an XbaI site. This construct was digested with XhoI and XbaI, subcloned into pBKCMV (Invitrogen), and subsequently digested with HindIII and XbaI. This fragment was ligated into the pCMV5RIX vector, generating the pCMV5sp vector. The 11F construct (42Garmroudi F. Devi G. Slentz D.H. Schaffer B.S. MacDonald R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 642-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was excised from the pCMV5 vector with EcoRI and XbaI digestion and ligated into pCMV5sp, generating the 11Fsp construct. Transient expression of the minireceptors by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection into 293T human embryonic kidney cells and immunoblot analysis of cell lysates to measure expression of each construct were also performed as described (37Byrd J.C.

Coimmunoprecipitation of suPAR and Truncated Man-6-P/IGF2R— Aliquots of cell lysates containing the expressed Man-6-P/IGF2R minireceptors were incubated with 12 μl of packed M2 resin in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (HBS) plus 0.1% BSA at 4 °C for 3 h. The resin pellets were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 s and washed twice with 1 ml of HBS plus 0.05% Triton X-100 (HBST). Purified suPAR (1.67 μg) in HBST, with or without Man-6-P (5 mm), was incubated with resin at 4 °C overnight. The resin pellets were again collected and washed twice with HBST. Immunoblot analysis of the resultant pellets was performed using an α-uPAR antibody. The resin pellets were heated at 100 °C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins released from the resin pellets were electrophoresed on 8–16% reducing SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to BA85 nitrocellulose paper (Schleicher & Schuell) at 350 milliamps for3hat20 °C. The blots were blocked with 4% nonfat dry milk in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.l% Tween 20 and probed with α-uPAR polyclonal antibody 3 (1:300 dilution). The blot was then developed with 125I-protein A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and detected by autoradiography. Native Gel/Ligand Blot Analysis—Aliquots (40 μg) of purified full-length bovine Man-6-P/IGF2R were electrophoresed on a 4–12% native PAGE containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and then transferred to BA85 nitrocellulose paper. The blots were washed, blocked, and probed as described previously (38Byrd J.C. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18638-18646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), except using 125I-suPAR (∼5 × 107 cpm/8 ml) as the ligand and developed by autoradiography. Man-6-P/IGF2R-Sepharose Affinity Adsorption—Man-6-P/IGF2R-Sepharose was prepared using purified, full-length bovine receptor based on the procedure of Brown and Farquhar (44Brown W.J. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1984; 36: 295-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and similarly to the previously described procedure (5Garmroudi F. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26944-26952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, full-length bovine Man-6-P/IGF2R (∼520 μg) was coupled to 1 g (∼3.5 ml) of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) in 7.5 ml of 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.0, overnight at 4 °C. Ethanolamine (1 m) was added to the slurry (1:1, v/v) and incubated for 2 h at 20 °C. The resin was then washed with HBST and stored as a 50% (w/v) suspension in HBST with 0.02% NaN3 at 4 °C. suPAR Affinity Adsorption—Aliquots (25 μl packed) of Man-6-P/IGF2R-Sepharose were incubated with 125I-suPAR in HBST, with or without additives at 4 °C, overnight. The resin pellets were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of HBST. The resin pellets incubated in HBST alone were then eluted with HBST with or without additives at 4 °C for 3 h. The resin pellets were again collected and washed three times with 1 ml of HBS plus 0.1% BSA. The pellets were heated at 100 °C for 5 min in sample buffer containing dithiothreitol (DTT; 50 mm), and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 6–16% gradient gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and destained. The dried gels were then developed by autoradiography. Endogenous uPAR Affinity Adsorption—PC-3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium plus 7% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% gentamycin. Plasma membranes were prepared as previously described (45MacDonald R.G. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (Sigma). PC-3 plasma membrane preparations were extracted using 1:1 (v/v) extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, with antiproteases (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 80 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and with antiphosphatases (5 mm NaF and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate)) with mixing for 1 h at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant fractions were collected and retained for SDS-PAGE. Aliquots (∼500 μg) of PC-3 plasma membrane extract proteins were incubated with aliquots (20–40 μl) of packed Man-6-P/IGF2R-Sepharose or ethanolamine-blocked cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose for 16 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of the additives 5 mm Man-6-P, 5 mm Glc-6-P, or 1 μm IGF-II. Extraction buffer (500 μl) or suPAR (500 ng) was incubated with Man-6-P/IGF2R-Sepharose as controls. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged to collect the resin pellets. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and the resin pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of HBST. The resin pellets and aliquots (100 μl, 20%) of the supernatant fractions were heated at 100 °C for 5 min with sample buffer without DTT, and the released proteins were resolved by 6–16% gradient SDS-PAGE. The gels were immunoblotted with α-uPAR monoclonal antibody (16 h, 4 °C, 1:1000) followed by a secondary rabbit anti-mouse IgG (30 min, 20 °C, 1:1000) and then developed with 125I-protein A (30 min, 20 °C, 30 μl). Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment of suPAR—Either 125I-suPAR (∼150,000 cpm) or 125I-PMP-BSA (∼50,000 cpm) was incubated in phosphatase buffer (1 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3) plus 0.1% BSA with or without 1–5 units of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) for 16 h at 37 °C. Man-6-P/IGF2R-Sepharose in low pH HBST (HBST buffer at pH 6.8 rather than the standard pH 7.4) plus either 5 mm Glc-6P or 5 mm Man-6-P was added as indicated to the reaction mixtures to achieve a final pH of ∼7.4 and incubated for 8 h at 4 °C. The resin pellets were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 1 ml of HBST, and then heated for 5 min at 100 °C in sample buffer with 50 mm DTT. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 6–16% gradient gels, stained with Coomassie Blue, and destained. The dried gels were developed by autoradiography. Expression levels of bound uPAR were quantified using Storm Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences) analysis of the dried gels. Coimmunoprecipitation of Endogenous uPAR and Truncated Man-6-P/IGF2R—Aliquots of 293T cell lysates containing equimolar amounts of the expressed Man-6-P/IGF2R minireceptors were incubated with 15 μl of packed M2 resin in HBS plus 0.1% BSA at 4 °C for 3 h. The resin pellets were collected and washed twice. Additionally, HT1080 cells, a human fibrosarcoma cell line, were cultured in DMEM plus 5% fetal bovine serum and 0.05% gentamycin. HT1080 plasma membranes and extracts were prepared in a similar manner as the PC-3 membranes and extracts. The immunoprecipitated M2 resin pellets were incubated with aliquots of extract proteins (∼300 μg of PC-3, ∼500 μg of HT1080 in volumes of 0.3 or 0.5 ml, respectively) for 16 h at 4 °C. The resin pellets were collected by centrifugation. The supernatant fractions were transferred to new tubes, and the resin pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of HBST. The resin pellets and aliquots (100 μl, representing 33 or 20%) of the supernatants were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and resolved by 6–16% SDS-PAGE. The gels were then immunoblotted with polyclonal α-uPAR antibody 2 (1:500, 4 °C, 16 h) and developed with 125I-protein A. Immunodepletion Analysis of Endogenous uPAR Binding to the Man-6-P/IGF2R Construct 1–15F—Aliquots (300 μl) of lysates from 293T cells transfected with 1–15F or the vector, pCMV5, were immunoprecipitated with 15 μl of α-FLAG M2 resin as described above. Aliquots of PC-3 plasma membrane extract proteins (∼600 μg) were left untreated or were treated with polyclonal α-uPAR antibody 2 (1:250 dilution) or with nonimmune rabbit IgG (60 μg) for 2 h at 4 °C. Aliquots (10 μl of packed resin) of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) were added to the treated PC-3 plasma membrane extracts and incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose was collected by centrifugation, and the supernatants were carefully transferred to new tubes. The immunoprecipitated M2 resin pellets were then coimmunoprecipitated with aliquots (500 μl) of untreated or treated PC-3 plasma membrane extracts for 16 h at 4 °C. The resins were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 s, and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. The resin pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of HBST. The pellets, aliquots (100 μl, 20%) of the supernatants, and aliquots (60 μl) of treated or untreated PC-3 plasma membrane extracts were heated at 100 °C for 5 min in sample buffer without DTT and resolved by 6–16% SDS-PAGE. The gels were immunoblotted with α-uPAR polyclonal antibody 2 as described above. Transient Expression of Truncated Man-6-P/IGF2R Minireceptors—In order to map the binding domain for uPAR on the Man-6-P/IGF2R, a series of truncated, soluble minireceptors was engineered that encompassed various regions of the Man-6-P/IGF2R extracytoplasmic domain followed in each case by a FLAG epitope tag (Fig. 1A). The numbers in the name of each construct denote the most amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal extracytoplasmic repeats expressed in that segment. All of the minireceptors are FLAG epitope-tagged at the carboxyl-terminal end, denoted by F, and all except 11Fsp contain the first half of repeat number one. The truncated receptors were transiently expressed in 293T cells. As"
https://openalex.org/W2091350044,"Activin A signaling is an important regulator of ovarian granulosa cell function. The cytosolic signal transducer Smad2 is most highly expressed in chicken granulosa cells (cGC) of preovulatory follicles. Moreover, Smad2 shows predominant nuclear localization in freshly isolated cGC, indicating active Smad signaling in vivo. Primary cGC cultured in vitro require activin A to sustain high Smad2 levels, which otherwise drop dramatically in the absence of activin A. This activin A-dependent Smad2 expression is abrogated by protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors, suggesting a role for PKA in activin signaling. In the absence of activin A, strong PKA activators such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP fail to elicit Smad2 induction. However, FSH and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP boost activin A-dependent Smad2 up-regulation, giving rise to Smad2 levels similar to expression in vivo levels. Interestingly, the effect is specific for Smad2, since expression of the structurally and functionally closely related Smad3 remains entirely unaffected. Hence, activin A induces Smad2, but not Smad3, to high levels requiring PKA activation. Since Smad2 and Smad3 target distinct yet overlapping sets of TGF-β/activin-responsive genes, the selective Smad2 induction by FSH/activin A could allow FSH to efficiently modulate the transcriptional readout of activin A signaling in avian granulosa cells.

Ovarian granulosa cells are epithelial cells of endodermal origin (1Mulheron G.W. Schomberg D.W. Adashi E.Y. Leung P.C.K. The Ovary. 1st Ed. Raven Press, New York1993: 337-361Google Scholar). Granulosa cells are also termed follicle cells and, being the somatic cells closest to the germ cell, are thought to play important roles in oocyte development. In birds, granulosa cells form a monolayer of closely packed cuboidal cells embedded between the perivitelline layer, which surrounds the oocyte and constitutes the avian homologue of the mammalian zona pellucida, and a basal lamina, which separates granulosa cells from the theca layers (2Perry M.M. Gilbert A.B. Evans A.J. J. Anat. 1978; 125: 481-497PubMed Google Scholar). In vertebrates, ovarian granulosa cells are a main source of activins and inhibins (3Erickson G.F. Hsueh A.J.

They are formed by homo- and heterodimerization of three subunits: inhibin α, inhibin βA, and inhibin βB, yielding activin A (βAβA), activin B (βBβB), activin AB (βAβB), inhibin A (αβA), and inhibin B (αβB) (4Burger H.G. Igarashi M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1701-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Like all TGF-β family members, activins signal via transmembrane receptor serine/threonine kinases of the TGF-β receptor family. Based upon structural and functional properties, the family consists of upstream type II receptors and downstream type I receptors. After the assembly of the ligand-induced heteromeric receptor complex, type II receptors transphosphorylate type I receptors, which in turn phosphorylate two intracellular signal transducers, the R-Smads Smad2 and Smad3 (5Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). This step is controlled by a phosphatidylinositol-3′-phosphate binding protein known as the Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA). SARA presents Smad2 and Smad3 to the receptor complex by binding cooperatively to unphosphorylated R-Smads and the receptor complex. Phosphorylation of SARA-presented R-Smads by type I receptors leads to dissociation of R-Smads and SARA from the receptor complex (6Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated R-Smads are then able to recruit a common mediator Smad, the co-Smad Smad4, followed by the translocation of an R-Smad-co-Smad complex to the nucleus, which directly participates in the regulation of gene transcription (5Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar, 7Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8ten Dijke P. Miyazono K.

The inhibitory Smads (or I-Smads), Smad6 and Smad7, oppose the action of signal-transducing R-Smads by forming stable associations with activated type I receptors, thereby preventing R-Smad phosphorylation and activation (11Hayashi H.

FSH is a glycoprotein secreted from the anterior pituitary gland, acting exclusively on ovarian granulosa cells and testicular Sertoli cells (16Findlay J.K. Drummond A.E. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 183-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These appear to be the only cell types expressing the corresponding FSH receptor, a typical seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor. Ligand binding activates protein kinase A (PKA) through the elevation of intracellular cAMP. PKA in turn regulates transcription mainly via phosphorylation of the cAMP-responsive element binding protein/activating transcription factor family CREB/ATF (17Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar). Notably, FSH does not act solely via cAMP, since it also stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways via an alternatively spliced FSH receptor in porcine granulosa cells (18Babu P.S.

Furthermore, FSH can activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways downstream of PKA in mammalian granulosa cells (19Das S. Maizels E.T. DeManno D. St Clair E. Adam S.A. Hunzicker-Dunn M.

There is increasing evidence suggesting that activins are not only endocrine regulators of FSH availability but also potent effectors of autocrine or paracrine intraovarian signaling. Activin receptors and downstream Smad proteins are present in rat ovaries (22Cameron V.A. Nishimura E. Mathews L.S. Lewis K.A. Sawchenko P.E. Vale W.W.

However, the knowledge about granulosa cells and how they respond to Smad signaling and its regulation is still rudimentary. Smad signaling is regulated at several different pathway levels by phosphorylation (31Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 32Brown J.D. DiChiara M.R. Anderson K.R. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Topper J.N. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and induction of I-Smad expression (35Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M.

However, most of these studies utilized cell lines overexpressing Smads at unphysiological levels. Hence, apart from I-Smad induction, little is known about the expression levels of the endogenous proteins, and even less is known about possible regulatory mechanisms that could control endogenous Smad expression in response to external stimuli.We have previously established a novel culture system for chicken granulosa cells (cGC), which allows for propagation of functionally differentiated, primary avian granulosa cells (36Schmierer B. Schuster M.K. Shkumatava A. Kuchler K. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 620-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This system closely mimics the in vivo situation and greatly facilitates studies on endogenous Smad expression and regulation. Here we demonstrate a high abundance of Smad2 in this highly specialized epithelial cell type. We provide evidence that activin A signaling cooperates with PKA. Most interestingly, we show that Smad2, but not Smad3, expression is tightly regulated in response to FSH/activin A. We suggest that FSH/activin A-dependent Smad2 up-regulation constitutes a mechanism enabling FSH to change the transcriptional target readout of activin signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals, cGC Isolation, and Cell Culture—Brown Derco laying hens were obtained from Heindl Co. (Vienna, Austria) and maintained on layer's mesh with water and feed provided ad libitum under a daily light period of 16 h. All animal experimentation was in compliance with the regulations of the animal ethics committee of the University of Vienna. Hens were sacrificed by decapitation, and granulosa sheets were isolated from large preovulatory follicles as described previously (37Gilbert A.B. Evans A.J. Perry M.M. Davidson M.H. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1977; 50: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) using minor modifications (36Schmierer B. Schuster M.K. Shkumatava A. Kuchler K. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 620-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Dispersed cells were resuspended and plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (catalog no. 41965; Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 ng/ml (1.4 nm) human pituitary FSH (Calbiochem), and 25 ng/ml (1.8 nm) human recombinant activin A (R & D Systems). cGC were cultivated under standard conditions (37 °C, 5% (v/v) CO2) and, after reaching confluence, further propagated by splitting 1:2.Growth Factors and Inhibitors—In general, cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as described above. Before the start of an experiment, cells were shifted into supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, lacking FSH and activin A, and incubated for 24 h. Where applicable, inhibitors were added 30 min prior to growth factor supplementation. Inhibitor concentrations used were 10 μm PD98059, 3 μm KT5720, 3 μm H89 (Calbiochem), and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). Growth factors were added at 25 ng/ml (1.8 nm) for activin A (R & D Systems), 50 ng/ml (1.4 nm) for FSH (Calbiochem), and 100 μm for 8-Br-cAMP (Sigma).Protein Preparation, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—Attached cGC were lysed directly in the culture dishes by the addition of 30 μl/cm2 SDS-PAGE sample buffer (5% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) SDS, 2.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue). After boiling for 5 min, lysates were stored frozen at -20 °C. Protein extracts were separated in 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Protran™ nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were stained with Ponceau S to verify protein transfer and equal protein loading, followed by blocking with 5% (w/v) fat-free milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody incubation was done overnight at 4 °C using rabbit anti-Smad2 antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) diluted 1:2000 and rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) diluted 1:200. Mouse anti-β-catenin antibodies (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA) and mouse anti-pancadherin antibodies (Sigma) were diluted 1:4000. After incubation with secondary goat-anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Oncogene, Boston, MA) antibodies, each at a dilution of 1:10:000, bands were visualized using ECL™ Western blotting detection reagent as suggested by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences).Immunofluorescence—Preovulatory follicles (POFs) from adult hens were embedded in freezing agent (Microm, Walldorf, Germany) and immediately shock-frozen on dry ice. Cryostat sections of 20-μm thickness were prepared using an HM 500 OM cryomicrotome (Microm) and transferred onto Superfrost™-Plus slides (Menzel, Braunschweig, Germany). Alternatively, intact cGC sheets were isolated from POFs and spread on microscope slides. Cultured cGC were grown directly on collagen I-coated glass slides (Becton Dickinson). After fixation in acetone/methanol (1:1) at -20 °C for 15 min, sections, sheets, or cultured cells were rehydrated for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C. Rabbit anti-Smad2 antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:300; mouse anti-pancadherin and mouse anti-β-catenin antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:500. Secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor™ series, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were applied at dilutions of 1:500 in 1% (w/v) fat-free milk powder/phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C. After several phosphate-buffered saline washes, the first of which contained DAPI to stain nuclear DNA, slides were mounted in fluorescence mounting medium (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) and inspected using an Axiovert 135 microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).Isolation of Total RNA and Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated from various chicken tissues or cultured granulosa cells using Tri-Reagent™ (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. About 20 μg of total RNA were incubated with 1 volume of denaturing solution (2 m glyoxal, 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 66% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide) for 1 h at 50 °C to resolve RNA secondary structures. Next, one-sixth volume of 6× loading solution (0.25% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.25% (w/v) xylenecyanol, 30% (v/v) glycerol) was added, and samples were loaded onto 1.5% (w/v) agarose gels. RNA gels were run in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, at 10 V/cm. Fractionated RNAs were blotted to positively charged Hybond-N+™ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in 20× SSC (3 m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) using capillary transfer. RNA was UV-cross-linked to membranes using an energy output of 1.2 × 105 μJ (Stratalinker™, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). RNA was visualized by methylene blue staining (0.04% (w/v) in 0.5 m sodium acetate pH 4.5). After destaining with H2O, membranes were prehybridized for4hat65 °Cin0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 7% (w/v) SDS.Radiolabeling of cDNA Probes and Hybridization—About 25-ng ali-quots of respective cDNA probes were radiolabeled using a random-prime labeling system (Megaprime™ cDNA labeling kit; Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany) as suggested by the manufacturer. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex G-50 columns (NICK™ columns; Amersham Biosciences). Radiolabeled cDNA probes were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and directly added to the prehybridization solution. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 65 °C. After washing in wash buffer (40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1% (w/v) SDS), membranes were wrapped in Saran™ wrap and exposed to phosphorimaging screens for up to 3 days. Bands were scanned in the optical scanner Storm™840 (Amersham Biosciences). Northern blots were also exposed to x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.) to visualize RNA bands by autoradiography. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Northern blots and immunoblots show results of representative experiments.RESULTSSmad2 Expression and Localization in Vivo—We have cloned a full-length cDNA encoding chicken Smad2 (EMBL/GenBank™ accession number GGA318063). The encoded protein is 99% identical to human Smad2, readily suggesting a functional conservation of avian and human Smad2. We then analyzed the tissue-specific expression pattern by Northern blotting. Ovarian granulosa cells from large preovulatory follicles exhibited by far the highest Smad2 mRNA levels when compared with all other chicken tissues examined (Fig. 1A). Except for testes, which had a second, smaller transcript, only a single Smad2 mRNA species of 3.8 kb was detected. Further, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting experiments revealed that Smad2 protein was also highly expressed in cGC, whereas Smad2 expression in adjacent theca cells was undetectable (Fig. 1B). These results indicate a special role for Smad2 signaling in granulosa cells. Interestingly, Smad2 was not only highly expressed but also localized predominantly to the nucleus in freshly isolated cGC-sheets (Fig. 1C), indicating an active Smad2 signaling pathway. These results suggest a pivotal role of TGF-β-like signals for granulosa cell function in vivo.Activin A Activates the Smad Pathway and Induces Smad2 Expression—Activin A represents a likely candidate to trigger nuclear accumulation and activation of Smad2 as seen in cGC freshly isolated from intact follicles. Hence, cultured cGC were treated with activin A, and Smad2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation were examined. As an immediate response to activin A, Smad2 was modified by phosphorylation within 2 h, as shown by immunoblotting using phosphospecific antibodies recognizing phosphorylated P-Smad2 (Fig. 2A). Immunostaining of cGC with anti-Smad2 antibodies revealed efficient translocation of the protein into the nucleus within the same time period (Fig. 2B). If cGC were cultured in the absence of activin A, Smad2 expression was rapidly down-regulated. To test whether loss of Smad2 expression was due to a lack of stimulating ligand, we added activin A to depleted cells and followed Smad2 by Northern analysis (Fig. 3). Indeed, the addition of activin A reinduced and thus increased Smad2 mRNA levels. However, simultaneous addition of activin A and FSH caused Smad2 induction in a synergistic way, leading to a massive up-regulation of Smad2 mRNA (Fig. 3). Although we cannot rule out that changes in mRNA stability also contribute to Smad2 regulation, the observed regulatory effects are most likely due to transcriptional control. Interestingly enough, the induction was specific for Smad2, since expression levels of the functionally and structurally closely related Smad3 mRNA remained completely unaffected by treatment with activin A or activin A/FSH (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Activin A promotes Smad2 phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation.A, immunoblot showing phospho-Smad2 (upper panel), as well as total Smad2 (lower panel). B, cells grown on microscope slides either remained untreated (left panels) or were treated with 25 ng/ml activin A for 2 h (right panels). Cells were fixed and stained with anti-Smad2 antibodies (green) and anti-pancadherin antibodies (red) to mark cell boundaries. Nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI (blue).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Activin A specifically induces Smad2 but not Smad3. Cultured cGC were treated for 24 h with indicated growth factor combinations, followed by total RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis with cDNA probes specific for chicken Smad2 and Smad3, respectively. Methylene blue staining of rRNA served as loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Smad2 Induction by Activin A Requires Active PKA—Smad2 protein showed the same regulation pattern as Smad2 mRNA. Whereas FSH alone failed to induce Smad2, a combination with activin A boosted Smad2 induction, giving rise to very high Smad2 protein levels (Fig. 4A). These data indicate functional cooperation between activin A and FSH signaling. Because FSH action could not be blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD98059, FSH-triggered MEK/ERK activation cannot explain the observed effects (Fig. 4A). Further, the cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP efficiently simulated the presence of FSH regarding Smad2 induction (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that FSH acts through cAMP. Notably, in the absence of activin A, neither FSH nor 8-Br-cAMP elevated Smad2 expression (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that cGC require activin A in vitro to sustain in vivo levels of Smad2. Moreover, the involvement of FSH-triggered, cooperating PKA signaling seemed likely. Again, Smad2 mRNA showed the same regulation pattern as the corresponding protein, indicating transcriptional regulation (data not shown).Fig. 4FSH boosts activin A-dependent Smad2 induction and acts via cAMP.A, cultured cGC were treated with activin A and FSH alone or in combination of both in the absence or the presence of 10 μm PD98059 for 24 h. Protein extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Smad2 antibodies. B, FSH was replaced by 8-Br-cAMP to mimic the effect of FSH. ZO-1 served as loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further analyze the role of the FSH pathway, two PKA inhibitors, KT5720 and H89, were tested for their ability to block FSH- and 8-Br-cAMP-induced effects on activin A-triggered Smad2 induction. As shown in Fig. 5, both PKA inhibitors abrogated Smad2 induction by activin A/FSH or activin A/8-Br-cAMP. Strikingly, immunoblotting demonstrated that Smad2 induction by activin A alone was completely abolished by both PKA inhibitors, indicating that activin A signaling requires basal PKA activity to induce Smad2 (Fig. 5A). The protein levels of the cadherin and β-catenin controls remained unchanged during these treatments. Further, Northern blotting showed that Smad2 mRNA induction was significantly attenuated by the PKA inhibitors KT5720 (Fig. 5B) and H89 (data not shown), fully confirming the protein data. By sharp contrast, the steady state levels of the mRNA encoding the structurally and functionally related Smad3 remained constant under all tested conditions (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate a requirement for both activin A and PKA activity to induce Smad2. Neither activin A nor PKA activity alone were sufficient, implying that activin A and FSH trigger converging signaling pathways, leading to enhanced Smad2 expression in cGC.Fig. 5PKA inhibitors block Smad2 induction.A, cells were treated with the indicated growth factors and inhibitors. After 24 h, protein extracts were subjected to immunoblotting using Smad2 antibodies. As loading controls, blots were incubated with anti-pancadherin or anti-β-catenin antibodies, both of which remain unregulated under the conditions used. B, cells were treated as above, and total RNA was prepared after 24 h and subjected to Northern blotting using cDNA probes specific for Smad2 and Smad3, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Smad2 mRNA Induction Requires Activin A-dependent de Novo Protein Synthesis—In order to learn more about the mechanism of cooperation between activin A and the cAMP pathway, Smad2 induction was studied in time course experiments. Smad2 induction is a delayed process, since Smad2 mRNA became elevated only after about 6 h following the addition of growth factors. More importantly, the induction is completely abolished by cycloheximide, strongly suggesting that at least one of the pathways inducing Smad2 requires de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 6A). To further characterize this putative protein synthesis step, cGC were pretreated with activin A for 24 h followed by 8-Br-cAMP addition and Northern analysis. Pretreatment was carried out in the presence of PKA inhibitors to block basal PKA activity and to avoid subsequent Smad2 induction during the preincubation period. Smad2 expression remained constantly low during the preincubation. However, mRNA levels were induced as early as 2 h after 8-Br-cAMP addi"

Although HCN-encoded pacemaker channels are functionally distinctive from voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels in their unique opening upon hyperpolarization rather than depolarization, the two classes of channel proteins are structurally homologous to each other.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46233-46242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Azene E. Xue T. Li R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 547: 349-356Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, additional domains that are important for HCN gating remain to be identified. Recently, we reported (22Henrikson C. Xue T. Dong P. Sang D. Marban E. Li R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 13647-13654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that the anionic S3-S4 residue Glu-235 of HCN1 channels prominently influences activation by acting as a surface charge. Glu-235 may affect gating by shaping the transmembrane electric field sensed by the nearby S4, but it is uncertain whether other S3-S4 residues also participate in the process of gating. Furthermore, the secondary structure of this external linker is not known. Here we probed the structural and functional role of the HCN1 S3-S4 linker (defined as 229–237; Fig. 1) by introducing systematic mutations into the entire linker and studying their effects. Modeling algorithms for predicting secondary conformations and mutagenesis data suggest that the S3-S4 linker of HCN channels, like that of voltage-gated K channels, is likely to be helical. Our results provide important structural and functional insights into HCN gating, an important biological process that figures prominently in pacing, and thus the development of effective therapies for diseases (such as sinus node dysfunction and absence epilepsy) that may be associated with Ih (23Schulze-Bahr E.N.A.E.N.A.

Mutations were created by using PCR with overlapping mutagenic primers and confirmed by DNA sequencing. cRNA was transcribed from NheI-linearized DNA using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). HCN1 channel constructs were heterologously expressed and studied in Xenopus oocytes as described previously (16Xue T. Marban E. Li R.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Xue T. Li R.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, stage IV to VI oocytes were surgically removed from anesthetized female frogs after immersion in 0.3% tricaine (3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester) followed by digestion with 1 mg/ml collagenase (type IA) in OR-2 solution containing (in mm) 88 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) for 30–60 min. After defolliculation of cells by incubation in OR-2 with 10% fetal bovine serum for 15–30 min, isolated oocytes were injected with cRNA (50 or 100 ng per cell) and stored in ND96 solution containing (in mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.6) supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 5 mm pyruvate, and 0.5 mm theophylline. Electrophysiology, Experimental Protocols, and Data Analysis—Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed at room temperature (23–25 °C) using a Warner OC-725B amplifier (Hamden, CT) 1–2 days after cRNA injection as described (16Xue T. Marban E. Li R.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The regular recording bath solution contained (in mm): 97.8 KCl, 2 NaCl, 10 HEPES, and 1 MgCl2 (pH 7.5). MgCl2 concentration was increased in certain experiments as indicated. The voltage dependence of HCN channel activation was assessed by plotting tail currents measured immediately after pulsing to –140 mV as a function of the preceding 3-s test pulse voltage normalized to the maximum tail current recorded. Data were fit to the Boltzmann functions using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm in a non-linear least squares procedure as shown in Equation 1, m∞=1/{1+exp((Vt−V1/2)/k)}(Eq. 1) where Vt is the test potential, V½ is the half-point of the relationship, k = RT/zF is the slope factor, and R, T, z, and F have their usual meanings. Changes in free energy (ΔΔG) associated with steady-state activation shifts caused by amino acid substitution were calculated using Equation 2, ΔΔG=RT(V1/2,Mutant/kMutant−V1/2,WT/kWT)(Eq. 2) A cutoff of 1 kcal/mol in the absolute magnitude of ΔΔG was used to indicate significance in this study. For simplicity, the time constants for activation (τact) and deactivation (τdeact) were estimated by fitting macroscopic and tail currents, respectively, with a mono-exponential function. However, it should be noted that sigmoidicity was observed during the onset of some HCN1 currents. Similarly, tail currents at certain voltages also exhibited an initial delay. The mechanism underlying such complex kinetic behavior of HCN channels is not understood; further analysis using multiple exponential components is beyond the scope of the present article. All data reported are mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined for all individual data points and fitting parameters using oneway analysis of variance and the Tukey HSD post-hoc test at the 5% level. Modeling Algorithms—The secondary structure of the S3-S4 linker of HCN1 channel was evaluated separately by the algorithms PROF (cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein), SSpro2 (promoter.ics.uci.edu/BRNN-PRED), and APSSP2. PROF is an improved version of PHDhtm, which uses evolutionary information as input to predict the locations of transmembrane helices in integral membrane proteins by dynamic programming (25Baldi P. Brunak S. Frasconi P. Soda G. Pollastri G. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 26Rost B. Fariselli P. Casadio R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1704-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). SSpro2 is an algorithm for secondary structure predictions based on bidirectional recurrent neural networks and PSI-BLAST-derived profiles (27Pollastri G. Przybylski D. Rost B. Baldi P. Proteins. 2002; 47: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The advanced protein secondary structure prediction (APSSP2) server employs PSI-BLAST as well as the modified example based learning technique. Modeling Algorithms Predict a Helical Secondary Conformation for the HCN1 S3-S4 Linker—Recently, we reported (22Henrikson C. Xue T. Dong P. Sang D. Marban E. Li R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 13647-13654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that the S3-S4 residue Glu-235 of HCN1 influences activation gating by acting as an external surface charge of the channel. In stark contrast to Glu-235 mutations, charge neutralization or reversal of the nearby anionic residue Asp-233, however, did not alter wild-type (WT) HCN1 gating properties. Furthermore, D233C (in the background of C318S to eliminate the intrinsic sensitivity of WT channels to sulfhydryl reactive compounds (20Xue T. Li R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46233-46242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) was also not reactive to the externally applied sulfhydryl modifier methanethiosulfonate ethyl ammonium (MTSEA). One possibility that potentially explains these observations is that the HCN1 S3-S4 linker (defined as residues 229–237 here) has a helical secondary structure such that residues 233 and 235 face different sides of the helix thereby exerting distinct functional effects when mutated (22Henrikson C. Xue T. Dong P. Sang D. Marban E. Li R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 13647-13654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we first evaluated the secondary conformation of the S3-S4 linker using the modeling algorithms PROF and SSpro2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1 summarizes the results generated from PROF and SSpro2 for this channel region. According to PROF, the S3-S4 residues 234–237 are likely to conform a helical secondary structure (confidence levels >7 on a scale of 10 for these positions) with residues 229–233 being a random coil (note that the confidence levels for residues 232 and 233, however, were comparatively low) that connects the S3-S4 linker to S3. This prediction by PROF is in complete accordance with the notion that the S3-S4 linker, or part of it, is helical. In fact, similar predictions were also generated by the algorithms SSpro2 and APSSP2 (Fig. 1). Motivated by these modeling results, we next sought to experimentally test, and refine where necessary, the above structural predictions. Indeed, we had employed previously a similar approach to successfully identify backbone helices in the Na+ channel pore (28Yamagishi T. Li R.A. Hsu K. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Effects of Neutralizing the S3-S4 Residues Glu-229 and Lys-230 on Activation Gating—To determine experimentally the structural and functional role of the HCN1 S3-S4 linker, we first studied the effects of neutralizing Glu-229 and Lys-230 with alanine substitution (i.e. E229A and K230A correspond to a net charge change of +1 and –1 at these channel sites, respectively). Figs. 2 and 3 compare the gating properties of E229A, and K230A mutants with those of WT channel E229A produced a somewhat positive yet statistically insignificant shift (p > 0.05) in the steady-state activation relationship of HCN1 channels. Despite its opposite charge change (relative to E229A), K230A significantly shifted steady-state activation in the same depolarizing direction (p < 0.05). Although the slope factor of K230A was unchanged, the slope factor of E229A was smaller than WT (p < 0.05). These steady-state gating parameters are summarized in Table I.Fig. 3Effects of E229A and K230A on gating kinetics. Effects of E229A and K230A mutations on activation (i.e. τact; A and B, respectively) and deactivation (τdeact; C) kinetics.

Open table in a new tab To obtain kinetic insights into the gating changes associated with E229A and K230A channels, we next examined their activation and deactivation properties. Interestingly, E229A channels displayed drastically decelerated gating kinetics (Fig. 3, A and C). In contrast, activation and deactivation kinetics of K230A channels were significantly accelerated (Figs. 3, B and C). These kinetic changes were accompanied by a depolarizing shift of the peak of their voltage dependence concomitant with the corresponding rightward shift of the steady-state activation midpoint (cf. Fig. 2B). Collectively, these observations are consistent with the notion that the S3-S4 linker is functionally important for HCN1 gating. Mutations of Gly-231, Met-232, and Glu-235 but Not Residues 233–234 and 236–237 Altered Gating—Because these results were encouraging, we proceeded to study the effects of replacing all the remaining S3-S4 residues individually by alanine (except glycine for residue Glu-235 because we had previously studied E235A (22Henrikson C. Xue T. Dong P. Sang D. Marban E. Li R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 13647-13654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar); see Table I). The mutation M232A led to a significant depolarizing activation shift (Fig. 4) with significantly slowed gating kinetics (up to 3- and 1.3-fold increase in τact and τdeact, respectively) whose peaks of voltage dependence were also displaced in the same positive direction (Fig. 5). As anticipated from our recently published results (22Henrikson C. Xue T. Dong P. Sang D. Marban E. Li R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 13647-13654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar) on various charge-altering Glu-235 mutations (such as Asp, Ala, Pro, His, Lys, and Arg), the charge-neutralized glycine substitution E235G (charge change = +1) also shifted the steady-state activation curve in the depolarizing direction without altering the slope factor (Fig. 4). The kinetic changes associated with this mutation were largely insignificant except for the range of –70 to –40 mV where the peaks of voltage dependence of activation and deactivation were positively shifted (Fig. 5). The gating phenotypes of G231A channels were similar to E235G (Fig. 4) except their deactivation kinetics were somewhat hastened over the entire voltage range examined (Fig. 5). Unlike the above-mentioned S3-S4 sites (i.e. 229, 230, 231, 232, and 235), mutating Asp-233, Ser-234, Val-236, and Tyr-237 to alanine led to gating properties indistinguishable from those of WT (p > 0.05; Fig. 6). These observations indicate that the functional changes observed with E229A, K230A, G231A, M232A, and E235G substitutions were site-specific. Our results are further summarized in Fig. 8A by plotting the absolute energetic changes (|ΔΔG|) associated with the activation shifts resulting from various single S3-S4 mutations relative to WT HCN1.Fig. 5Effects of G231A, M232A, and E235G on gating kinetics.

In this model, Met-232, Glu-235, and Gly-231 are on the same side of the helix, opposite that of the functionally non-consequential Asp-233, Ser-234, Val-236, and Tyr-237. Glu-229 and Lys-230, however, are not part of the helix (as predicted by SSPRO and PROF). Instead, these charged residues may constitute a linker region that connects S3 with the S3-S4 linker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) S3-S4 Deletion Mutants Decelerated Gating Kinetics—To explore further the role of the S3-S4 linker, we next investigated the effects of shortening the linker. We created the deletion constructs EVY235–237ΔΔΔ, whose S3-S4 residues Glu-235, Val-236, and Tyr-237 had been simultaneously removed. Fig. 7 shows that the activation midpoint of EVY235–237ΔΔΔ channels was significantly displaced in the depolarizing direction by ∼22 mV. Both activation and deactivation kinetics were decelerated with their voltage dependence shifted in the concomitant depolarizing direction. Given that the single mutants V236A and Y237A did not alter gating and that neutralizing Glu-235 consistently produced only about +7 mV of activation shift (cf. Fig. 4) (22Henrikson C. Xue T. Dong P. Sang D. Marban E. Li R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 13647-13654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar), these changes in gating properties observed with EVY235–237ΔΔΔ channels could not be sufficiently explained by the elimination of the anionic residue at position 235. The results suggest that both the length and composition of the S3-S4 linker influence HCN1 gating. S3-S4 Linker Is a Gating Determinant—Recently, we reported (22Henrikson C. Xue T. Dong P. Sang D. Marban E. Li R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 13647-13654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that the anionic S3-S4 residue Glu-235 of HCN1 channels influences activation by acting as a surface charge. However, the role of other S3-S4 linker residues in gating had not been evaluated. In the present study, we identified four novel determinants within the S3-S4 linker, namely Glu-229, Lys-230, Gly-231 and Met-232, that when substituted significantly altered the gating phenotypes of HCN1 channels. These data support the notion that the S3-S4 linker of HCN1 channels is a gating determinant. Indeed, previous studies (29Nakai J. Adams B.A. Imoto K. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 30Gonzalez C. Rosenman E. Bezanilla F. Alvarez O. Latorre R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gen Physiol. 1997; 109: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have shown that the extracellular S3-S4 linker is also a determinant of activation in various depolarization-activated K+ and Ca2+ channels (see below for detailed comparison). A Refined Helical Model of the HCN1 S3-S4 Linker— Whereas Glu-229, Lys-230, Gly-231, Met-232, and Glu-235 when mutated prominently influence activation gating, none of the Asp-233, Ser-234, Val-236, and Tyr-237 mutations studied altered HCN gating properties (Fig. 8A). These observations argue that perturbations of gating by S3-S4 mutations were site-specific. For instance, residues flanking Glu-235 (i.e. Ser-234 and Val-236) when substituted by alanine did not affect activation properties. These results suggest that the native side chain orientation of Glu-235 and thus its functional role are not disrupted when these nearby residues are replaced. Instead, residues Gly-231 and Met-232, which are farther way from Glu-235 in the primary sequence, altered gating when mutated. Interestingly, these observations were most consistent with the prediction by the modeling algorithms SSpro2 and PROF that part of the HCN1 S3-S4 linker is a helical structure. Fig. 8B shows a refined model of such prediction based on our experimental observations. The model is essentially the same as that generated by SSpro2 and PROF except that residues 231–233, whose predicted confidence levels were comparatively low, are now included as part of the S3-S4 helix. Such helical arrangement of residues 231–237 places the functionally important Gly-231, Met-232, and Glu-235 clustered on one side of the proposed helix but the non-consequential residues (Asp-233, Ser-234, Val-236, and Tyr-237) facing the other. Glu-229 and Lys-230, as modeled by SSPRO and PROF, plausibly form a coil that connects the S3-S4 linker to S3. When the physical properties (such as charge and flexibility) of this “connector” are altered, changes in the orientation of the S3-S4 helix and subsequently changes in gating properties result. Indeed, the hydrophilic properties of the side chains of residues 229 and 230 further raise the intriguing possibility that they are exposed to the extracellular milieu. Further experiments are needed to assess their side chain accessibility as well as to investigate whether these charged residues, like Glu-235, have direct electrostatic influences on HCN gating. Alternatively, it is possible that residues 235–237 are indeed part of the S4 segment and that the actual S3-S4 linker consists of residues 229–234 only. Such arrangement also readily explains the electrostatic influences of Glu-235 (with this anionic residue as part of the voltage-sensing S4) on HCN activation (22Henrikson C. Xue T. Dong P. Sang D. Marban E. Li R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 13647-13654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Perhaps, the side chain of Asp-233 faces away from S4 thereby minimizing its effects on gating. However, alterations of the physical properties of the S3-S4 linker, as discussed above, could lead to subsequent changes in gating. This second possibility is equally attractive particularly given that serine (Ser-234) has a high probability of bending helical structures of proteins (34Ballesteros J.A. Deupi X. Olivella M. Haaksma E.E. Pardo L. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2754-2760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Disregarding the precise location of this helix, which remains to be defined, it is apparent that part of the stretch of residues spanning from Glu-229 to Tyr-237 conforms a helical structure. Taken together, our present study lays the ground work required to further address this question. Structural and Mechanistic Insights: HCN and Kv Channels Are Analogous—The helical secondary conformation of the HCN S3-S4 linker (assuming that our conclusion with HCN1 can be generalized to the other isoforms) described above is analogous to that previously proposed for the S3-S4 linker of Kv channels (35Li-Smerin Y. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our previous finding that charge neutralization or charge reversal of the anionic S3-S4 residue Glu-235 attenuated the gating responses of HCN1 channels to the charge-screening effects of external Mg2+ (22Henrikson C. Xue T. Dong P. Sang D. Marban E. Li R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 13647-13654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar) also strongly mirrors the abolition of surface shielding effects of H+ observed with the Shaker mutant whose S3-S4 linker (including the acidic residues Glu-333 to Glu-335 and Asp-336) had been deleted (32Sorensen J.B. Cha A. Latorre R. Rosenman E. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our present finding that HCN1 gating kinetics decelerate when the S3-S4 linker was shortened is also analogous to previous experiments with Shaker channels demonstrating that shortening the S3-S4 linker slows activation kinetics (31Gonzalez C. Rosenman E. Bezanilla F. Alvarez O. Latorre R. J. Gen Physiol. 2000; 115: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is probable that the HCN S3-S4 linker, similar to that of Shaker (30Gonzalez C. Rosenman E. Bezanilla F. Alvarez O. Latorre R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9617-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Gonzalez C. Rosenman E. Bezanilla F. Alvarez O. Latorre R. J. Gen Physiol. 2000; 115: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32Sorensen J.B. Cha A. Latorre R. Rosenman E. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), forms a protein-lined dielectric vestibule surrounding the N-terminal portion of S4 and thereby influences gating. By using cysteine scanning mutagenesis, Larsson and colleagues (19Mannikko R. Elinder F. Larsson H.P. Nature. 2002; 419: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) provided evidence that the voltage-sensing mechanisms of HCN and Kv channels are conserved. The same as Kv channels, the S4 domain of HCN channels move outward and inward during depolarization and hyperpolarization, respectively. It is possible that the S3-S4 helical face consisting of Gly-231, Met-232, and Glu-235 is in contact with the S4 voltage sensor, thereby acting as a “lubricant” for its translocation during the process of gating. Indeed, S3-S4 residues could alter the energy barriers separating the channel transitions required for channel openings, thereby providing a potential explanation for the altered gating kinetics observed with several of our S3-S4 constructs (although there is no general rule for predicting the effect of a mutation at these critical sites as was the case of many K channel studies). However, we are unable to conclude whether the S3-S4 linker undergoes major conformational changes during gating based on our present finding. Nevertheless, emerging lines of evidence appear to suggest that although HCN and Kv channels have distinctive activation profiles, their gating machineries appear to share significant structural and functional similarities (16Xue T.

(Lond.). 2001; 537: 93-100Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) suggest that regions other than the S4 domain of HCN channels also prominently modulate gating. These regions include the P-loop, the extracellular S1-S2, S3-S4, S5-P linkers, as well as the cytoplasmic S4-S5 and S6-CNBD linkers. Because different HCN isoforms are known to exhibit distinct gating behaviors (8Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 10Santoro B. Tibbs G.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 741-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 41Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), it is likely that variant residues within these linkers underlie such isoform-specific gating differences. Consistent with this notion, chimeric studies of HCN1 and HCN4 channels, whose gating kinetics differ by ∼40-fold, suggest that amino acid differences within the S1-S2 linker account for some but not all of the differences in activation kinetics between these isoforms (40Ishii T.M. Takano M. Ohmori H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 93-100Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, the slower kinetics of HCN2 can be partially attributed to the Ala to Arg pore variant at HCN1 position 352 (also an arginine in the slow HCN4) (21Azene E. Xue T. Li R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 547: 349-356Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is apparent that discrete sequence differences with small but definitive additive individual effects underlie isoform-specific gating properties. Given that the HCN1 positions 230–232 influence gating and the equivalent sites in HCN2–4 are also variant residues (e.g. Met-232 of HCN1, whose equivalent residues in HCN2 and 4 are isoleucine, is of particular interest since the mutation M232A significantly slows gating kinetics, thereby rendering HCN1 more HCN2- and HCN4-like; cf. Fig. 1), these differences are prime candidates for exploring the molecular basis of isoform-specific HCN gating."

This FGF-2 isoform allows cells to grow in low serum concentrations through still unknown mechanisms called intracrine regulations. Different peptide hormones and cytokines have been found to be nuclearized through NLS and to induce cell proliferation. The existence of molecules acting as negative regulators of the intracrine-induced cell growth has not been explored. Pancreatic cells AR4-2J were stably transfected to express selectively the HMW FGF-2. We demonstrated that activation of the somatostatin receptor subtype SST2 by the somatostatin analogue RC-160 in serum-deprived medium inhibits the mitogenic effect of the HMW FGF-2, without affecting growth of control cells. The signaling pathway implicates Gαi/JAK2/SHP-1. The Gαi inhibitor pertussis toxin and the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 abrogate the inhibitory effect of RC-160 on HMW FGF-2-induced cell growth. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate the constitutive association of JAK2 and SHP-1, and RC-160 induces a rapid activation of both proteins followed by the dissociation of the complex. AG490 prevents the RC-160 induced SHP-1 activation indicating the implication of JAK2 in this process. JAK2 and SHP-1 are immunoprecipitated with SST2 in basal conditions indicating the existence of a functional signaling complex at the receptor level. In summary, these data provide the following evidence: 1) the intracrine-induced proliferation can be reversed by extracellular acting polypeptides; 2) SST2 inhibitory signaling may involve the JAK2/SHP-1 pathway.

(FGF-2), a protein belonging to the family of heparin-binding growth factors, is responsible for the growth promotion, blood supply, and invasiveness in cancer (for review, see Ref. 1Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). These pleiotropic effects have been related previously to auto-paracrine regulations involving extracellular FGF-2 and FGF receptors of high and low affinities (2Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). However, unlike normal adult cells, tumor cells express FGF-2 as different molecular weight forms with a predominance of high molecular weights. FGF-2 peptides are synthesized from a single mRNA at AUG and CUG start codons (3Prats H. Kaghad M. Prats A.C. Klagsbrun M. Lelias J.M. Liauzun P. Chalon P. Tauber J.P. Amalric F. Smith J.A. Caput D.

Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Translation of the high molecular forms of 21–34 kDa is initiated at CUG codons located upstream from the AUG codon. The latter codon initiates synthesis of the low molecular weight peptide of 155 amino acids (LMW FGF-2 of 18 kDa). The high molecular weight forms only differ from the LMW peptide by the presence of N-terminal extensions of different lengths containing nuclear localization sequences (NLS) (5Arnaud E. Touriol C.

Physiol. 1991; 147: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Confocal and immunohistochemical analyses localized the HMW FGF-2 in the nucleus (1Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 8Monzat V. Ratovo G. Estival A. Fanjul M. Bertrand C. Clement B. Vaysse N. Hollande E. Clemente F. Eur J.

Quarto N. Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chimeric cytoplasmic proteins containing the NLS sequence of the large FGF-2 isoforms were found in the nucleus, confirming the translocation efficiency of the NLS (9Bugler B. Amalric F. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Because all FGF-2 forms lack the secretory signal peptide, the LMW peptide is highly concentrated in the cytoplasmic compartment, whereas the other isoforms are nuclear. The LMW form can be secreted by a novel energy-dependent secretory mechanism involving Na,K-ATPase (11Florkiewicz R.Z. Anchin J. Baird A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 544-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12Dahl J.P. Binda A. Canfield V.A. Levenson R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14877-14883Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After an endocytotic process, small amounts of the LMW peptide are targeted to the nucleus, and in contrast to the HMW, the LMW FGF-2 is specifically localized in the nucleolar compartment (13Baldin V. Roman A.M. Bosc-Bierne I. Amalric F. Bouche G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The puzzling feature of the HMW FGF-2 is now supported by the more recent discovery of nuclear migration of various growth factors, peptide hormones, and cytokines, many of which possess NLS sequences (for review see Refs. 14Jans D.A. Hassan G. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar and 15Re R.N. Regul. Pept. 2002; 106: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Localization of these peptides in different intracellular compartments has been extensively analyzed by electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. Nuclear translocation of several transmembrane receptors including the FGF receptor-1 has also been observed (16Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 17Reilly J.F. Maher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). One conceivable advantage of direct action of cytokines and/or their receptors in the nucleus is a more specific response than activation of overlapping signaling pathways (14Jans D.A. Hassan G. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The implication of these nuclearized peptides or receptors in specific regulatory functions, for instance in the control of gene transcription, has also been reported (15Re R.N. Regul. Pept. 2002; 106: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat.

In some cases the known biological functions related to nuclear localizations concern proliferation and/or antiapoptotic responses (among the factors involved are FGF-2, insulin-like growth factor-1, and parathyroid hormone-related protein), and in other cases they have been related to angiogenic processes (among the factors involved are FGFs, vascular endothelial growth factors, and platelet-derived growth factors) (14Jans D.A. Hassan G. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Re R.N. Regul. Pept. 2002; 106: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Clarke W.E. Berry M. Smith C. Kent A. Logan A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, some of the biological functions of the nuclearized peptides still remain to be established, and the intracellular regulatory mechanisms involved, called “intracrine regulations,” are still poorly understood (16Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of FGF-2 in several physiological and pathological situations, its biological effects have been more extensively studied. The results obtained after the FGF-2 selective expression either of the secreted form of 155 amino acids (LMW FGF-2) or of the nuclear translocated high molecular weight form of 210 amino acids (HMW FGF-2) indicate the existence of some differences in their biological functions. For instance, expression of the LMW FGF-2 enhances cell migration (10Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Quarto N. Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and increases integrin (19Klein S. Bikfalvi A. Birkenmeier T.M. Giancotti F.G. Rifkin D.B. J. Biol.

In these reports, which also include the cell line AR4-2J-A3 used in the present study, addition of neutralizing anti-FGF-2 antibodies, which recognize the common sequence of all FGF-2 forms, or expression of a dominant negative FGF receptor-1 were found to counteract the biological effects of the extracellular FGF-2 but not those of the HMW FGF-2 (10Bikfalvi A.

Thus, the LMW peptide regulates cell functions predominantly through auto-paracrine mechanisms, whereas the larger one acts via intracrine regulations independently of the activation of cell surface FGF receptors (1Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 18Clarke W.E. Berry M. Smith C. Kent A. Logan A. Mol. Cell.

Human pancreatic cancers overproduce the HMW FGF-2 of 210 aa, and this peptide facilitates tumor growth (30Korc M. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 1998; 7: 25-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of tumor growth is a crucial point in cancer therapy; therefore, inhibition of the mitogenic effect of the HMW FGF-2 might represent a critical point for new therapeutic approaches. However, at the present time, experimental data demonstrating the possible inhibition of the intracrine FGF-2-mediated cell proliferation are not available. Somatostatin is a widely distributed inhibitory neuropeptide that directly antagonizes the mitogenic action of growth factors in many cell types (for review see Ref. 31Patel Y.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). This antimitogenic effect is only observed when cells are induced to proliferate. SST2 belongs to the G-protein-coupled somatostatin receptor family, which consists of five subtypes (SST1 to SST5). In the pancreatic cancer cell line AR4-2J, the SST2-mediated antiproliferative effect involves the activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (32Zeggari M. Esteve J.P. Rauly I. Cambillau C.

SHP-1 dephosphorylates and consequently inhibits several signal transducers involved in the cell cycle progression (34Pages P. Benali N. Saint-Laurent N. Esteve J.P. Schally A.V. Tkaczuk J. Vaysse N. Susini C. Buscail L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15186-15193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to analyze whether somatostatin was able to inhibit the intracrine-induced growth of pancreatic cancer cells AR4-2J expressing the HMW FGF-2 of 210 aa. Our data show that somatostatin via its receptor SST2 inhibits the HMW FGF-2-induced proliferation by a mechanism involving JAK2 kinase activation. This is the first demonstration of inhibition of an intracrine-regulated cell growth. Cell Culture—A3 cells expressing the HMW FGF-2 of 210 amino acids and control CAT cells were routinely grown in DMEM containing 4.5 g/liter glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Trypsin (0.05%)/EDTA (0.02%) (Invitrogen) was used to dissociate the cells for successive passages, and medium was replaced every 2 days. Cultures were regularly checked for the absence of contamination by mycoplasma. Experiments were carried out in serum-free media. Cells were plated in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), and after an overnight attachment media were replaced by DMEM minus serum, buffered at pH 7.3 with 20 mm Hepes. Growth experiments were performed either by counting the cells (Coulter Counter Z1) or by adding to cell cultures 18 h after drug addition 1 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences, 44 Ci/mmol, final concentration 7 Ci/mmol), and the incorporated radioactivity was measured 6 h later. The PKC inhibitor GF109203X, the Src inhibitor PP2, the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 (tyrphostin B42), the MEK inhibitor PD 98059, the p38 inhibitor SB 203580, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, and the Gαi inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX) were from Calbiochem. Most of these drugs were solubilized in Me2SO and used at the final concentration of 0.1%. They were added to serum-free cultures for 24 h, and control cells were grown in the presence of Me2SO. Plasmids and Transfections—The retroviral transfection of AR4-2J cells was described previously (22Estival A. Louvel D. Couderc B. Prats H. Hollande E. Vaysse N. Clemente F. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1182-1187PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell line AR4-2J-A3 (called A3 cells) was obtained by transfecting the pancreatic cancer cell line AR4-2J with an FGF-2 cDNA encoding only the FGF-2 of 210 amino acids. The cell line AR4-2J-CAT (called CAT cells) was obtained by transfecting the pancreatic cancer cell line AR4-2J with the same vector in which the FGF-2 cDNA was replaced by the gene encoding the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The geneticin-resistant cells were shown to express low levels of FGF-2 (22Estival A. Louvel D. Couderc B. Prats H. Hollande E. Vaysse N. Clemente F. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1182-1187PubMed Google Scholar). The transfected cell lines used for the present experiments were not cloned. For experiments on SHP-1 functions, A3 cells were transiently transfected with the inactive mutant SHP-1 (SHP-1-C453S) vector (33Lopez F. Esteve J.P. Buscail L. Delesque N. Saint-Laurent N. Theveniau M. Nahmias C. Vaysse N. Susini C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24448-24454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Transfections were realized overnight with FuGENE 6, and the total amount of the transfected vector was normalized to 0.2 μg/well, with the void vector. Experiments were carried the 3rd day after transfection and 48 h after serum deprivation. Analysis of SST1 and SST2 Receptors Expression by Real Time PCR—Total RNA from control CAT and A3 cells was prepared from 24-h starved cells by using the TriPure isolation reagent (Roche Applied Science). The RNase-free DNase (Promega) (2.5 IU) was then added to the purified RNA and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to hydrolyze genomic DNA. The DNase was then inactivated at 94 °C for 5 min. Reverse transcription was then performed with 1 μg of total RNA in RT buffer containing 0.5 mm each of dNTP, 20 units of RNasin (Promega, Charbonnières, France), 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The real time PCR was performed on a GeneAmp 5700 (Applied Biosystems), using the Master Mix SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science). The thermal profiles were 2 min at 50 °C, followed by 10 min at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Standard curves for expression of each gene were generated by serial dilutions of RT templates. Relative quantifications of signals were done by normalizing the signals of SST1 and -2 genes with those of β-actin. Primers were synthesized by MWG-Biotec (Courtaboeuf, France). The following primers were used (35Vidal C. Rauly I. Zeggari M. Delesque N. Esteve J.P. Saint-Laurent N. Vaysse N. Susini C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 97-104PubMed Google Scholar): SST1, forward primer 5′-GCAACATGCTCATGCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCGTTATCCATCCAGC-3′; SST2, forward primer 5′-GGGCGAATCCGGGGCA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTTTGGAGGTCTCCATTG-3′. Primers specific for rat β-actin were obtained from Clontech (BD Biosciences). Western Blots—Cells were grown for 24 h in a serum-free medium buffered at pH 7.3 with 20 mm Hepes. After washings with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) containing the protease inhibitor Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (25 mm NaF and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein was determined on the supernatant using the BCA assay (Pierce). SHP-1, JAK2, SST1, and SST2 were analyzed on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and then electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). For co-immunoprecipitation studies, equal amounts of proteins (1 mg) from unstimulated or RC-160-stimulated cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against SHP-1, JAK2, SST1, or SST2, overnight at 4 °C in the presence of protein A-agarose with gentle rocking. The immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation at 2,000 × g, washed 3 times with the lysis buffer containing the different inhibitors, solubilized in the sample buffer, and then boiled 5 min before SDS-PAGE separation. The anti-SHP-1 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories, and lysates from Jurkat cells were used as control of migration. The anti-JAK2 and the antiphosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Euromedex, Mundolsheim, France). The anti-SST2 and anti-SST1 receptor antibodies were described previously (36Theveniau M.A. Yasuda K. Bell G.I. Reisine T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 37Schulz S. Schmitt J. Wiborny D. Schmidt H. Olbricht S. Weise W. Roessner A. Gramsch C. Hollt V. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2047-2052PubMed Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL assay kit, Amersham Biosciences) and signals quantified with a laser densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). SHP-1 and JAK2 Activities—SHP-1 activity was measured using 33P-labeled poly(Glu-Tyr) as substrate (Sigma) as described previously (38Buscail L. Delesque N. Esteve J.P. Saint-Laurent N. Prats H. Clerc P. Robberecht P. Bell G.I. Liebow C. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2315-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins with anti-SHP-1 antibodies as described above were resuspended in a Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mg/ml bacitracin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm genistein, and 10 μm PP2. The poly(Glu-Tyr) was phosphorylated with [γ-33P]ATP (38Buscail L. Delesque N. Esteve J.P. Saint-Laurent N. Prats H. Clerc P. Robberecht P. Bell G.I. Liebow C. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2315-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by adding the phosphorylated substrate and allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30 °C and then stopped with trichloroacetic acid. One unit of SHP-1 activity was defined as the amount of phosphatase that released 1 pmol of phosphate/min/mg solubilized protein. JAK2 kinase activity was measured by autophosphorylation, on the immunoprecipitates obtained with the anti-JAK2 antibody in the presence of protease and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors as described above. Immunocomplexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and three times with Tris-buffered saline at 4 °C and then resuspended with cold kinase buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 3.75 μm ATP, and 0.5 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP at pH 7.4. Kinase reactions were allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 10 min (39Yu C.L. Jove R. Burakoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5206-5210PubMed Google Scholar); proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and 32P-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Quantifications were performed on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The same blot was also probed with the anti-JAK2 antibody, and the antigen-antibody complex was revealed by ECL prior to quantification with the laser densitometer. Statistics—Statistical significance was determined according to the unpaired Student's t test. RC-160 Inhibits Proliferation of AR4-2J Cells Expressing the HMW FGF-2 of 210 aa—The pancreatic cell line AR4-2J was chosen for its interesting properties; it express FGF-2 receptors but does not synthesize detectable amounts of FGF-2 (22Estival A. Louvel D. Couderc B. Prats H. Hollande E. Vaysse N. Clemente F. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1182-1187PubMed Google Scholar). In transfected AR4-2J-A3 cells (A3 cells), the expression of the HMW FGF-2 of 210 amino acids was under the control of the β-actin promoter. A weak promoter rather than a strong viral promoter was chosen to obtain low expression levels of HMW FGF-2 (22Estival A. Louvel D. Couderc B. Prats H. Hollande E. Vaysse N. Clemente F. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1182-1187PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of low serum concentrations, A3 cells grew faster and reached higher saturation densities than control cells transfected with the same vector in which the HMW FGF-2 cDNA was replaced by CAT (CAT cells) (Fig. 1), as already reported for other cell types (1Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Somatostatin has been shown to inhibit cell growth induced by exogenous growth factors or serum (31Patel Y.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). In order to investigate whether somatostatin was able to inhibit the overgrowth induced by the expression of the HMW FGF-2, A3 and control CAT cells were grown in the absence of FCS, with or without vapreotide (RC-160), a stable analogue of somatostatin. After 48 h of culture in serum-deprived medium, overgrowth of A3 versus CAT cells reached 26.2 ± 3.1% (n = 10; p < 0.01). RC-160 did not affect proliferation of CAT cells in serum-free medium. By contrast, 100 nm RC-160 abrogated CAT cell growth induced by 1% FCS (result not shown). RC 160 inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner proliferation of A3 cells grown in serum-free conditions, with a maximal effect of about 85% at 100 nm (Fig. 2A) and a half-maximal effect at 1 ± 0.9 nm. Thus, 100 nm RC-160 treatment decreased A3 cell proliferation to levels of control CAT cells. These data indicate that expression of HMW FGF-2 results in an increase of cell growth that can be suppressed by addition of RC-160.Fig. 2Inhibition by RC-160 of the HMW FGF-2-induced cell growth.A, dose response of RC-160 on A3 growth. Cells were seeded in DMEM containing 10% FCS. After an overnight attachment, cells were serum-deprived and treated with increasing concentrations of RC-160. Cells were counted after a 48-h treatment. RC-160 had no effect on CAT but inhibited A3 cell growth. Results are expressed as percent of A3 versus CAT growth.

They are ubiquitously expressed, and their biological importance is increasingly recognized in areas such as development and connective tissue assembly (1Ameye L. Young M.F. Glycobiology. 2002; 12 (R): 107R-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 2Forsberg E. Kjellen L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Decorin is a PG secreted by fibroblasts and deposited in the extracellular matrix, where it exerts important functions by interacting with collagen and growth factors (3Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18843-18846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). It is substituted with a single galactosaminoglycan chain located in the N-terminal part of the core protein. The biosynthesis of GAG chains of the chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) and heparan sulfate (HS)/heparin type are initiated on a common linkage region tetrasaccharide (4Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). After translation of the core proteins, the GAG synthesis is initiated by β-d-xylosyltransferase (XylT) that catalyzes transfer of a xylose (Xyl) in β1-O-linkage to a serine present in a consensus sequence for GAG initiation (5Brinkmann T. Weilke C. Kleesiek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11171-11175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Two homologs of mammalian xylosyltransferases (XylT I and XylT II) have been cloned (6Gotting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These enzymes are present in the ER based on immunolocalization studies and by studies using microsomal preparations (7Kearns A.E. Vertel B.M. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11097-11104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hoffmann H.P. Schwartz N.B. Roden L. Prockop D.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1984; 12: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sugar donor of Xyl, UDP-Xyl, is formed from UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) by the action of UDP-GlcUA decarboxylase, which has been located to the lumen of the ER (9Moriarity J.L. Hurt K.J. Resnick A.C. Storm P.B. Laroy W. Schnaar R.L. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the apparent absence of a transport protein capable of transporting UDP-Xyl over the ER membrane (10Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). After addition of Xyl, two Gal residues are attached, catalyzed by β1,4-galactosyltransferase I (GalT I) and β1,3-galactosyltransferase II (GalT II), respectively. These enzymes have been cloned (11Almeida R. Levery S.B. Mandel U. Kresse H. Schwientek T. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26165-26171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 12Bai X. Zhou D. Brown J.R. Crawford B.E. Hennet T. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48189-48195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and their subcellular locations have been determined to the cis- and medial-Golgi based on immunostaining and colocalization studies (12Bai X. Zhou D. Brown J.R. Crawford B.E. Hennet T. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48189-48195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Pinhal M.A. Smith B. Olson S. Aikawa J. Kimata K. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12984-12989Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). GalT I has been reported to interact with XylT in vitro and may therefore also be present in the ER (14Schwartz N.B. Roden L. Dorfman A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 56: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The fourth step in the initiation of the GAG chain involves β1,3-glucuronyltransferase I (GlcUAT I), completing the synthesis of the linkage region GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser common to both CS/DS and HS/heparin (15Kitagawa H. Tone Y. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6615-6618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). GlcUAT I has been shown to colocalize with α-mannosidase II in the medial-Golgi (13Pinhal M.A. Smith B. Olson S. Aikawa J. Kimata K. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12984-12989Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Galactosaminoglycan synthesis is then initiated by the action of β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase I (GalNAcT I) (16Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J.J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8841-8846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the addition of a GalNAc to the GlcUA in the linkage region, whereupon chondroitin is further polymerized by chondroitin synthase that catalyzes the addition of alternating -3GalNAcβ1- and -4GlcUAβ1-units (17Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The subcellular location of GalNAcT I and chondroitin synthase have not yet been determined. Sulfotransferases catalyze the transfer of sulfate groups from the sulfate donor 3′-phosphoadenylyl 5′-phosphosulfate to various positions in the chain to complete the biosynthesis of CS. To form DS, GlcUA residues are epimerized to iduronic acid catalyzed by GlcUA C5 epimerase (18Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sulfotransferases are generally believed to reside in the trans-Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN), but the exact location appears to vary in different cell lines (19Spiro R.C. Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Garcia J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Uhlin-Hansen L. Yanagishita M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3200-3206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The linkage region can be modified by sulfation of the Gal residues and by phosphorylation of the Xyl residue (22Fransson L.A. Belting M. Jonsson M. Mani K. Moses J. Oldberg A. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Ueno M. Yamada S. Zako M. Bernfield M. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29134-29140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Sulfation of Gal has only been demonstrated in the CS linkage region, and it has been speculated that this might be a signal for CS biosynthesis (18Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ueno M. Yamada S. Zako M. Bernfield M. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29134-29140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Xyl has been shown to be a transient event during decorin biosynthesis in rat skin fibroblasts (24Moses J. Oldberg A. Cheng F. Fransson L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this case phosphorylation increased during Gal addition and was nearly stoichiometric at the trisaccharide level, followed by rapid dephosphorylation upon the addition of GlcUA. The enzymes responsible for the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Xyl are unknown. The only phosphorylation of a structural sugar unit that has been studied in detail is the formation of mannose 6-phosphate in N-linked oligosaccharides on proteins destined for the lysosomes. This occurs in two steps during passage through the early secretory pathway. First GlcNAc-1-phosphate is transferred from UDP-GlcNAc to mannose. Subsequently, a hexosaminidase catalyzes removal of the GlcNAc portion leaving a 6-phosphate on mannose (25Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar, 26von Figura K. Hasilik A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Lysosomal proteins with a C-terminal KDEL ER retention signal (27Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) accumulate the phosphodiester intermediate form (28Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To study early events in the O-glycosylation of decorin, we have transiently expressed decorin with or without a C-terminal KDEL ER retention signal in COS-7 cells. We have determined the structure of the major O-linked saccharide including the phosphorylation of Xyl and chondroitin sulfation. This was performed in the absence or presence of the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) to manipulate the secretory pathway (29Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Materials—l-[35S]Methionine/l-[35S]cysteine (>1000 Ci/mmol), sodium [32P]phosphate (carrier free), d-[6-3H]galactose (34 Ci/mmol), d-[6-3H]glucosamine (26 Ci/mmol), and sodium [35S]sulfate (>37 TBq/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. Superose 6 (HR10/30) was from Pharmacia Corp., and Biogel P10 was from Bio-Rad. Other chemicals were of analytical grade. Construction of Vectors—Eukaryotic expression vectors were constructed using PCR and rat decorin cDNA ligated in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA I neo (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) (Dec) as template. To introduce KDEL we used the 3′ primer (GGAATTCTTACAGTTCGTCCTTGTAGTTCCCAAGTTGAA) together with the 5′ primer (CGGATCCATGAAGGCAACTCTCG). Dec was digested with BamHI/SacI (964). This fragment was ligated to PUC18 digested with BamHI/SacI. The PCR product was cleaved with SacI/EcoRI and ligated to the PUC18 construct digested with SacI/EcoRI. The whole decorin construct was then moved to pcDNA I neo (Dec-KDEL). To construct the S34A mutation we used the 5′ primer (TATCAGCTGCTGGCATAATCCCTTACGA) together with the 3′ primer (CGTCTAGATGTAGTTCCCAAGTTGAATG). The PCR product was cleaved with PvuII/XbaI and ligated to Dec, from which the StuI(257)/XbaI fragment had been removed (Dec-S34A). By exchanging the EcoRV(297)/XbaI fragment in Dec-S34A for the same fragment from Dec-KDEL, we obtained Dec-S34A-KDEL. The amplifications were performed for 30 cycles in a thermal cycler using Dynazyme Taq polymerase, 95 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. All of the PCR products were sequenced to confirm their sequence identity. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. One day prior to transfection, the cells were seeded in new bottles with fresh medium. The cells were transfected using electroporation (300 V, 500 microfarads in a Bio-Rad gene pulser) and then cultivated for 48 h prior to metabolic labeling. Metabolic Labeling—COS-7 cells expressing decorin constructs were labeled with [35S]sulfate (100 μCi/ml) in low sulfate minimal Eagle's medium with Earle's salts, (Nord Vac, Sweden), [35S]methionine (20 μCi/ml) in methionine-free minimal Eagle's medium with Earle's salts, (Sigma), [32P]phosphate (200 μCi/ml) in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN), and d-[6-3H]galactose (50 μCi/ml) and d-[6-3H]glucosamine (50 μCi/ml) in culture medium. When deficient media were used, the cells were preincubated in labeling medium for 20 min prior to addition of labeling medium with radioactive precursors. Brefeldin A (Sigma) was used at 10 μg/ml. Isolation of Decorin—Culture medium was collected and cleared by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min. The cell layer was washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then extracted using 0.15 m NaCl2, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml ovalbumin followed by centrifugation. Complete Protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) was added to inactivate proteases. Both media and cell lysates were supplemented with 1/100 volume of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose CL4B (Sigma) and were allowed to mix for several hours. After centrifugation, rabbit anti-rat decorin antiserum (30Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Moses J. Fransson L.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (1/200 volume) was added to the supernatant and incubated overnight. After another addition of protein A-Sepharose and incubation for 1 h, bound material was collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min. All of the steps were carried out at 4 °C. The immunoisolates were washed five times with 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% Tween 20, and decorin was eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE or boiling in 4 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm NaOAc, pH 5.8, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for subsequent size exclusion chromatography on Superose 6. Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was performed on Superose 6 (Amersham Biosciences) operated in 4 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm NaOAc, pH 5.8, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions of 1 min were collected. Biogel P10 was packed in Omnifit columns operated in 0.5 m NH4HCO3, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 at a flow rate of 3 ml/h. Fractions of 30 drops were collected. The samples were supplemented with 100 μg of carrier consisting of CS, HS oligosaccharides, raffinose, sucrose, and glucose. Decorin [6-3H]galactose-labeled GAG chains, secreted by rat skin fibroblasts, were digested with chondroitin ABC lyase to generate linkage region hexasaccharides and further digested with chondroitin ACI lyase to generate linkage region tetrasaccharides. The Lichrosorb-NH2 column (Merck) was operated in 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Three fractions/min were collected. The disaccharides were obtained by digestion of GAG chains with chondroitin ABC/AC-I lyases followed by purification on Biogel P10. The elution of non- and mono-sulfated unsaturated disaccharide standards were monitored by UV absorption at 232 nm. Radioactivity was measured using liquid scintillation counting (Beckman). Degradation Methods—O-Linked glycan chains were released by alkaline scission using 0.4 m NaOH, 50 mm NaBH4 for 24 h at 4 °C. After neutralization with glacial HOAc, the samples were lyophilized and dissolved in the appropriate buffer. Enzymatic digestions were performed after repeated cycles of lyophilization and dissolving in water to evaporate all NH4HCO3. Digestion with chondroitin ABC/AC-I lyases (Seikagaku Fine Biochemicals, Tokyo, Japan) and β1–3-glycuronidase (gift from Dr. Yoshida, Seikagaku Corp.) was performed in 0.1 m Tris acetate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.3, β-galactosidase (Sigma) was used in 50 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Expression of Core Proteins—To study early events in the O-glycosylation of decorin, we used cDNA constructs encoding wild-type decorin (Dec) or decorin-KDEL that encodes decorin with the ER retention signal KDEL in the C terminus (Dec-KDEL). When Dec-KDEL was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, the amount of [35S]sulfate-labeled decorin in the medium was considerably reduced as compared with the amount of PG in the medium after transfection with Dec (Fig. 1A). This indicates that decorin-KDEL is retained intracellularly and that the secretion is reduced. Cells transfected with Dec or Dec-KDEL were also labeled with [35S]methionine, and intracellular core proteins were analyzed by using SDS-PAGE after immunoisolation. The cells transfected with Dec expressed mainly a 65-kDa protein, in addition to a 43-kDa core protein (Fig. 1B). Dec-KDEL transfected cells expressed mainly a 43-kDacore protein but also minor amounts of the 65-kDa core protein. Both the 65- and 43-kDa core proteins were sensitive to endoglycosidase H degradation, showing that they were substituted with N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides and indicating that they had not reached the medial-Golgi in the secretory pathway (31Tarentino A.L. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 811-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Core Proteins—No [32P]phosphate-labeled core protein could be detected by using SDS-PAGE when Dec was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, presumably because of the low level of intracellular 43-kDa core protein (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 3). Expression of decorin-KDEL yielded a 43-kDa [32P]phosphate-labeled core protein, which migrated slightly more retarded on SDS-PAGE than [35S]methionine-labeled decorin-KDEL (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 4). This shows that the vast majority of intracellular core proteins are not substituted with [32P]phosphate. The [32P]phosphate-labeled decorin-KDEL was also sensitive to endoglycosidase H degradation, indicating similar locations of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated decorin-KDEL in ERGIC (data not shown). Retention of lysosomal enzymes by tagging the C terminus with the KDEL ER retention signal leads to accumulation of a GlcNAc-phosphate-mannose phosphodiester intermediate that is resistant to digestion with alkaline phosphatase (28Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, all phosphate groups in decorin-KDEL were sensitive to alkaline phosphatase, demonstrating the absence of a phosphodiester intermediate (Fig. 2, lane 5). Ser-34 in decorin is the amino acid residue that accepts Xyl, initiating GAG synthesis. To examine whether incorporation of phosphate was linked exclusively to O-glycosylation and did not represent amino acid phosphorylations, we used a mutated decorin, where Ser-34 was substituted with Ala (Dec-S34A). The Dec-S34A construct yielded no detectable sulfate-labeled decorin PG in the medium (Fig. 3A). A cDNA construct Dec-S34A-KDEL encoding mutated decorin with a KDEL ER retention signal in the C terminus was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. After labeling of cells with [32P]phosphate, no phosphorylated 43-kDa decorin core protein could be detected (Fig. 3B, lane 1). These results show that Ser-34 is indirectly essential for the phosphorylation by providing for the preceding O-glycosylation.Fig. 3SDS-PAGE of decorin with or without GAG-attachment site. COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding decorin or decorin-S34A. A, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine or [35S]sulfate.

[35S]Methionine-labeled (lane 3) and [35S]sulfate-labeled (lane 4) decorin-S34A.

The molecular size markers are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phosphorylated O-Linked Oligosaccharides—To analyze the O-linked GAG precursor of decorin-KDEL, immunoisolated core protein labeled with [32P]phosphate and [6-3H]galactose was subjected to alkaline β-elimination and chromatographed on Biogel P10 (Fig. 4). The major product eluted at a position corresponding to a pentasaccharide, but longer oligosaccharides were also obtained. The putative phosphorylated pentasaccharide was degraded by chondroitin AC I lyase, which is known to erode chondroitin chains to the linkage tetrasaccharide. The phosphorylated linkage oligosaccharide, resulting from the chondroitin AC I lyase digestion of the putative pentasaccharide, eluted at fractions 48–52 in Fig. 4. (data not shown). This oligosaccharide could be further reduced in size by the sequential degradation with linkage region degrading enzymes (see below). This indicates that the major linkage region GAG precursor is a phosphorylated pentasaccharide. The vast majority of the oligosaccharides were phosphorylated, because the 3H- and 32P-labeled saccharides coeluted on the Biogel P10 column (compare elution positions for phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated monosaccharide in Fig. 4). The 3H-labeled material in the peak at fraction 59 was not sensitive to chondroitinase AC I, β1–3-glucuronidase nor to β-galactosidase. Therefore, this material does not appear to represent the O-linked GAG precursor and was not further characterized. GAG Chain Polymerization—To examine whether O-linked saccharides on decorin-KDEL could serve as primers for GAG elongation, we treated cells with BFA. BFA causes mixing of the ER and Golgi compartments proximal to TGN and could expose the decorin-KDEL intermediate to the polymerizing and sulfating enzymes present in the medial-and the trans-Golgi compartments (29Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). When BFA was added to cells labeled with [32P]phosphate, a larger and more heterogeneous decorin-KDEL proteoglycan was obtained (Fig. 5, lane 2). This PG was smaller than decorin secreted by cells transfected with Dec (compare Figs. 1A and 3A, lane 2) and indicate a partial elongation of the GAG chain. The structure of O-linked GAG chain precursors synthesized in the absence or presence of BFA was determined. The cells transfected with Dec-KDEL were labeled with [32P]phosphate and [3H]glucosamine. Decorin-KDEL was immunoisolated from the cell layer, and alkali-released O-linked chains were separated on Biogel P10 (Fig. 6). In the absence of BFA, phosphorylated oligosaccharides with a major product corresponding to a pentasaccharide were again obtained (Fig. 6A). These saccharides incorporated no [3H]glucosamine, because no extensive GAG polymerization is taking place. Pooled saccharides, representing mostly pentasaccharides, were cleaved with chondroitin ABC/AC-I lyases, which should erode the saccharides down to ΔHexUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4XylOH-2-phosphate. Accordingly, chromatography on Biogel P10 yielded a single tetrasaccharide peak (Fig. 6B). This tetrasaccharide was first cleaved with β1–3-glycuronidase generating Galβ1–3Galβ1–4XylOH-2-phosphate (Fig. 6C) and then with β-galactosidase generating XylOH-2-phosphate (Fig. 6D). Alkaline phosphatase treatment of this product generated inorganic phosphate (data not shown). In the presence of BFA, all O-linked phosphorylated chains migrated in the void volume. This product contained large amounts of radiolabeled sugars derived from [3H]glucosamine, indicating extensive polymerization (Fig. 6E). When these chains were digested with chondroitin ABC/AC-I lyases, the resulting phosphorylated peak chromatographed in the expected position of a linkage tetrasaccharide (Fig. 6, compare F and B). Most of the 3H label appeared in disaccharides that could be cleaved into monosaccharides using β1–3-glycuronidase (data not shown). A minor peak containing 3H label and overlapping with the [32P]phosphate-labeled peak probably represented some residual tetrasaccharide from the repetitive part of the polymer not cleaved by the chondroitin lyases. The phosphorylated tetrasaccharides obtained from the linkage region of GAG primed in the presence of BFA were also sensitive to β1–3-glycuronidase and β-galactosidase (Fig. 6, G and H). All [32P]saccharides were sensitive to alkaline phosphatase digestion (data not shown). GAG Chain Sulfation—To analyze whether the GAG polymer generated on decorin-KDEL in BFA-treated cells contained sulfate, we labeled cells expressing decorin-KDEL with [3H]glucosamine in the presence of BFA. GAG chains derived from decorin-KDEL were digested with chondroitin ABC/AC-I lyases and analyzed on a Lichrosorb column (data not shown). All of the disaccharides were unsulfated. This indicates that the sulfotransferases and the polymerase are not located in the same Golgi compartment in these cells. No linkage-region Gal sulfation was detected (data not shown). Transient expression of rat decorin in COS cells led to the synthesis of a secreted polydisperse PG with an average molecular mass of 97 kDa. The majority of the intracellular decorin core proteins had a size of 65 kDa, and only a minor fraction corresponded to a 43-kDa core protein, which was probably destined for GAG substitution and secretion. The 65-kDa protein is probably the result of misfolding caused by the high level of expression in COS cells. In contrast, Dec-KDEL transfected cells contained a major intracellular 43-kDa decorin-KDEL core protein. The misfolded proteins destined for degradation must first be translocated across the ER membrane via translocation pores to reach the proteasome in the cytosol (32Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The interaction between decorin-KDEL and the KDEL receptor may prevent export out of the ER. Proteins destined for degradation in proteasomes are usually conjugated with multiple monomers of ubiquitin, giving rise to typical ladders when analyzed on SDS-PAGE (33Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). The 65-kDa decorin core protein migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE, suggesting substitution with another substituent (34Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) or an unusually uniform number of ubiquitin monomers. The 65-kDa decorin core protein exhibited a half-life of approximately 4 h when cells were subjected to pulse-chase experiments (data not shown). The 65- and 43-kDa core proteins were both substituted with N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides, indicating that the proteins had not reached the medial-Golgi compartment in the secretory pathway (31Tarentino A.L. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 811-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated decorin-KDEL core protein was slightly larger than core protein labeled with [35S]methionine. No phosphorylation could be detected when cells expressed a core protein lacking GAG attachment site (decorin-S34A-KDEL), showing that the phosphate is exclusively a substituent of the Xyl residues linked to Ser-34 in decorin. GAG synthesis appears to be initiated only in a minor fraction of the decorin-KDEL core proteins, and the majority of the decorin-KDEL core proteins substituted with O-linked oligosaccharides are phosphorylated. Lysosomal enzymes tagged with KDEL contain phosphodiester intermediates resistant to phosphatase digestion (28Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, the phosphate on decorin-KDEL could be removed by phosphatase, suggesting a different mechanism, possibly indicating the existence of a kinase. The majority of the decorin-KDEL O-linked oligosaccharides were GalNAcβ1–4GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-2-phospate, but longer chains were also present. This indicates that XylT, GalT I and II, GlcUAT I, and GalNAcT I are present and active in the ERGIC compartment. Recent immunolocalization results indicate that the bulk of GlcUAT I enzymes reside in the medial-Golgi. Our results demonstrate GlcUAT I activity also proximal to the medial-Golgi stacks. The nature of the first N-acetyl-hexosamine residue added determines whether further CS or HS polymerization will ensue. Our results indicate that this choice is made in the ERGIC. Despite the formation of a GalNAc-containing pentasaccharide, radiolabeling of the terminal GalNAc in the linkage region was low. This is because a long time is needed for [3H]glucosamine to equilibrate with UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-GalNAc present in the Golgi, and then with UDP-GalNAc transported back to the ER. Different intracellular pools of UDP sugar precursors have been reported (35Kresse H. Heidel H. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 22: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). GalNAcT I also possesses GalNAcT II activity, i.e. catalyzes transfer of GalNAc onto nonreducing terminal GlcUA of chondroitin in β1–4-linkage (16Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J.J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8841-8846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The longer oligosaccarides obtained, which appear to represent odd-numbered oligosaccharides, could thus be explained by the presence of minute amounts of GlcUAT II activity of CS synthase. When a terminal GalNAc acquires a GlcUA residue, it will immediately be substituted with another GalNAc residue resulting in odd-numbered oligosaccharides. All oligosaccharides were phosphorylated, indicating that dephosphorylation is not obligatory for addition of the first GlcUA. It has been reported 2Y. Tone, J. Nishihara, J. Tamura, H. Kitagawa, and K. Sugahara, unpublished data. that Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-2-phosphate is a better acceptor for GlcUA than Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl, indicating that phosphorylation promotes elongation (36Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Xyloside-primed GAG chains can retain Xyl-2-phosphate when produced in large amounts (37Moses J. Oldberg A. Fransson L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and extracellular PGs often contain residual amounts of Xyl-2-phosphate (38Oegema Jr., T.R. Kraft E.L. Jourdian G.W. Van Valen T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1720-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Fransson L.A. Silverberg I. Carlstedt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14722-14726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, dephosphorylation of Xyl-2-phosphate can be postponed until decorin has reached compartments distal to the ERGIC. However, Xyl phosphorylation was not detected in secreted decorin (data not shown), supporting the notion that the phosphorylation is transient (24Moses J. Oldberg A. Cheng F. Fransson L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). BFA is known to block anterograde but not retrograde vesicular transport in the secretory pathway. Using BFA it was demonstrated that CS synthase is located in the TGN of rat ovarian granulosa cells (20Uhlin-Hansen L. Yanagishita M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17370-17376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that both CS polymerase and CS sulfotransferases are located proximal to TGN in mouse mastocytoma cells (21Uhlin-Hansen L. Kusche-Gullberg M. Berg E. Eriksson I. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3200-3206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and in M21 human melanoma cells (19Spiro R.C. Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Garcia J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). BFA treatment of COS-7 cells resulted in partial polymerization of GAG chains in decorin. Sulfation could not be detected in the presence of BFA. Our results indicate that CS synthase resides in the medial- and/or trans-Golgi stacks and that CS sulfotransferases reside in the TGN in COS-7 cells. The latter compartment does not merge with the ER when cells are exposed to BFA. In the presence of BFA, Xyl remained phosphorylated during elongation. In the artificial environment created in the fused compartment, dephosphorylation may have been inactivated. Also, the simultaneous presence of both a phosphatase and a phosphorylating enzyme system could give the same result. Dephosphorylation could also be a TGN event, and Dec-KDEL would not be exposed to a putative phosphatase. Sulfation of the linkage region Gal residues has only been reported for CS, suggesting a potential role in regulating the substitution of the linkage region with CS or HS (18Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ueno M. Yamada S. Zako M. Bernfield M. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29134-29140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, we could not detect any sulfated Gal residues in decorin-KDEL even in the presence of BFA because sulfotransferases were apparently not relocated to the ER. Sulfation has been shown to stimulate further elongation by the GalNAcT II activity of chondroitin synthase that adds GalNAc to GlcUA during CS polymerization (40Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Ujikawa M. Goto F. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The GAG synthesized on decorin-KDEL in the presence of BFA contained no sulfate groups, which could be the reason why it is not polymerized up to the full length of CS in secreted decorin."

The C-terminal domains of Gγ subunits can contact receptors and influence the efficiency of receptor-G protein coupling in vitro. However, it is unknown whether receptor interaction with the C terminus of Gγ is required for signaling in vivo. To address this question, we cloned Gγ homologs with diverged C-terminal sequences from five species of budding yeast. Each Gγ homolog functionally replaced the Gγ subunit of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (STE18 gene product). Mutagenesis of S. cerevisiae Ste18 likewise indicated that specific C-terminal sequence motifs are not required for signaling. Strikingly, an internal in-frame deletion removing sequences preceding the C-terminal CAAX box of Ste18 did not impair signaling by either of its cognate G protein-coupled pheromone receptors. Therefore, receptor interaction with the C-terminal domain of yeast Gγ is not required for receptor-mediated G protein activation in vivo. Because the mechanism of G protein activation by receptors is conserved from yeast to humans, mammalian receptors may not require interaction with the tail of Gγ for G protein activation in vivo. However, receptor-Gγ interaction may modulate the efficiency of receptor-G protein coupling or promote activation of Gβγ effectors that co-cluster with receptors.

Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins consisting of α, β, and γ subunits relay signals from receptors for many hormones, neurotransmitters, and sensory stimuli (1Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Activated receptors promote GDP release and GTP binding to G proteins, resulting in dissociation of GTP-bound Gα subunits from Gβγ complexes, which trigger cellular responses. To activate G proteins, receptors are thought to act as a “lever” to move Gα relative to Gβγ by contacting a surface ∼30 Å from the nucleotide binding site of the Gα subunit (2Bourne H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 3Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R.

In this model, Gβ catalyzes nucleotide exchange, because it interacts with the lip of the nucleotide binding pocket formed by Switch 1 and part of Switch 2 of the Gα subunit (6Noel J.P. Hamm H.E.

Thus, movement of Gβ relative to Gα would allow Gβ to pull on the lip of the nucleotide binding pocket, inducing GDP release and subsequent GTP loading (4Iiri T. Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Consistent with this mechanism, a mutant of Gsα has been identified that requires association with Gβ to trigger a signal independently of a receptor (5Rondard P. Iiri T. Srinivasan S. Meng E.

Gβ may also provide a receptor binding site that is important for G protein activation (9Ongay-Larios L. Savinon-Tejeda A.L. Williamson Jr., M.J. Duran-Avelar M. Coria R.

Gγ subunits can bind receptors, as indicated by studies of rhodopsin and transducin, which show that βγ binds activated rhodopsin and promotes activation of the α subunit (13Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17032-17039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Phillips W.J. Wong S.C. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17040-17046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, rhodopsin preferentially activates transducin containing its cognate γ subunit (γ1; see Ref. 15Kisselev O. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); other receptors likewise couple preferentially with G proteins containing certain Gγ subunit isoforms in vitro (16Hou Y.

Selective coupling appears to be mediated by the diverged C termini of Gγ subunits, because peptides corresponding to the last 14 residues of γ1 stabilize the active conformation of rhodopsin (metaII) and competitively inhibit rhodopsin-mediated activation of transducin (19Kisselev O.G.

Thus, one variation of the “lever hypothesis” of G protein activation requires simultaneous binding of the C termini of Gα and Gγ to independent sites on a receptor (5Rondard P. Iiri T. Srinivasan S. Meng E. Fujita T. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6150-6155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), although other variations of this model do not (2Bourne H. Curr. Opin.

Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In certain signaling pathways, receptor interaction with the C terminus of Gγ may have a non-essential role in G protein activation. Studies have shown that γ7, which interacts poorly with M2 or M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in vitro, supports 2-fold more efficient coupling with these receptors than does a Go heterotrimer containing γ5, whose tail binds these receptors in vitro (16Hou Y. Azpiazu I. Smrcka A. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38961-38964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, muscarinic receptor coupling to Goin vitro is enhanced when the heterotrimer contains γ5 with a scrambled C-terminal sequence that does not bind muscarinic receptors (20Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41742-41747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be established whether receptor binding to the C termini of Gγ subunits is an obligate or modulatory event for G protein activation in vivo. We established previously that the C-terminal domain of Gγ promotes receptor-G protein coupling by analyzing mutations affecting the Gγ subunit (STE18 gene product) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In yeast, a single type of G protein heterotrimer transduces signals from mating pheromone receptors (21Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), providing a simple system to evaluate Gγ function genetically and biochemically. We found that Gγ truncated at position 94 (13 residues preceding the CAAX box) associates with Gβ but strongly impairs receptor-G protein coupling in vitro (agonist binding was low affinity and insensitive to GTPγS) 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin. (22Grishin A.V. Weiner J.L. Blumer K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4571-4578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor coupling defect was not because of lack of C-terminal prenylation or palmitoylation, because Gγ bearing a substitution (C107S) inactivating its CAAX box associated with Gα and Gβ and supported efficient receptor-G protein coupling in vitro (agonist binding was high affinity and sensitive to GTPγS). Therefore, peptide sequences between residue 94 and the CAAX box of yeast Gγ, equivalent to the receptor binding domains of mammalian Gγ subunits (14Phillips W.J. Wong S.C. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Here we have investigated whether the C-terminal domain of yeast Gγ is required for receptor-mediated signaling in vivo.By analyzing the function of a diverged family of Ste18 homologs from several species of budding yeast and amino acid substitutions affecting the C terminus of Ste18 we provide evidence indicating that the C-terminal domain preceding the CAAX box of Gγ is dispensable for receptor-mediated signaling in vivo.

A fragment containing the PGK promoter and terminator separated by a multicloning site containing restriction sites for EcoRI, HindIII, and BamHI was excised from the pPGK vector (25Kang Y. Kane J. Kurjan J. Stadel J.M. Tipper D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by digesting with XhoI and SalI and inserted into pRS425 (26Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) cut with XhoI and SalI. The resultant plasmid was digested with SalI and NotI and circularized to produce pRS425PGK, which has unique EcoRI, HindIII, and BamHI sites for expression cloning. Wild-type and mutant forms of the STE18 coding region were cloned as HindIII-BamHI fragments into pRS425PGK, which allowed expression of wild-type and mutant forms of HA-tagged Ste18. The N-terminal HA tag fully preserves Ste18 protein function (22Grishin A.V. Weiner J.L. Blumer K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4571-4578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All point mutations made in the STE18 gene expressed from the ADH promoter were constructed in pVT-HA-Ste18 (22Grishin A.V. Weiner J.L. Blumer K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4571-4578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). The STE18 internal deletion mutant removing sequences encoding amino acids 94–105 was constructed using the ExSiteTM mutagenesis method (Stratagene), which resulted in the additional substitutions N92T and A93R. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using appropriate primers. Cloning and Expression of STE18 Homologs from Five Divergent Saccharomyces Species—The genome sequences of five species of yeast of varying relatedness to S. cerevisiae (Saccharomyces bayanus (strain NRRL Y-11845), Saccharomyces castellii (NRRL Y-12630), Saccharomyces kluyveri (NRRL Y-12651), Saccharomyces kudriavzevii (IFO 1802), and Saccharomyces mikatae (IFO 1815); provided by M. Johnston, Washington University Genome Sequencing Center) were searched by BLAST for STE18 homologs. As is the case in S. cerevisiae, the genome of each of these species of yeast encoded a single STE18 homolog (data not shown). Contig sequences encoding each STE18 homolog were provided by P. Cliften and M. Johnston (Washington University Genome Sequencing Center) and will be deposited in Gen-BankTM by those investigators. Primers used to amplify only the coding region of each STE18 homolog were designed such that the resultant amplification products could be cloned as HindIII-BamHI fragments into pRS425PGK as follows. Genomic DNA from each species of yeast (obtained from M. Johnston, Washington University School of Medicine) and the following primers were used: forward S. bayanus, 5′-GCCCCCAAGCTTATGTCTGCAGTTCAGAACTCG-3′ and reverse S. bayanus, 5′-CGCGGATCCTTACATAAGCGTACAACAAGC-3′; forward S. kudriavzevii, 5′-GCCCCCAAGCTTATGTCTGCTATTCAGAACTCG-3′ and reverse S. kudriavzevii, 5′-CGCGGATCCTTACATAAGCGTACAACAAGC-3′; forward S. mikatae, 5′-GCCCCCAAGCTTATGTCTGTACTTCAAGATTCACC-3′ and reverse S. mikatae, 5′-CGCGGATCCTTACATAATCGTACAGCAAAC-3′; forward S. kluyveri, 5′-GCCCCCAAGCTTATGTCTTCAGAAGAGCAGCAACC-3′ and reverse S. kluyveri, 5′-CGCGGATCCTTACATAATTGCACAGCAGTTG-3′; forward S. castellii, 5′-GCCCCCAAGCTTATGTCACAACAGATAAAAACACC-3′ and reverse S. castellii, 5′-CGCGGATCCTTACATTATAGCACAGCAACC-3′. The amplification conditions using Taq polymerase were as follows: 96 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 43 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; 72 °C for 10 min. The resultant PCR fragments were sequentially digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into pRS425PGK to express the native, untagged forms of these Ste18 homologs in S. cerevisiae. The correct nucleotide sequence of each construct was confirmed by sequencing. Random Mutagenesis of S. cerevisiae STE18 and Identification of STE18 Dominant-negative Mutants—A plasmid suitable for performing random mutagenesis of codons 79–110 in the STE18 gene was constructed by introducing a silent KspI site into sequences encoding amino acids 77–79 and a KpnI site immediately downstream of the STE18 stop codon in plasmid pVT-HA-STE18, resulting in pVT-HA-STE18-KK. Oligonucleotides containing 1% of the three incorrect bases at each position spanning the coding region for amino acids 79–110 of Ste18 were synthesized and inserted into pVT-HA-STE18-KK cleaved with KspI and KpnI. Introduction of the library into Escherichia coli produced a pool of 1500 bacterial transformants that were used in the following ways. Sequencing of 16 random plasmids revealed that one was wild-type, and the remaining contained mutations affecting various codons throughout the targeted region, as expected. To select for dominant-negative STE18 mutations, we introduced the pool of 1500 plasmids into the wild-type S. cerevisiae strain RK511–6B. Portions of the transformation mixture were plated on selective media that lacked or contained a dose of α-factor (1 μm) sufficient to arrest growth of the parent strain expressing wild-type Ste18. Colonies resistant to α-factor were recovered at a frequency of 3%. Plasmid dependence of the α-factor-resistant phenotype was demonstrated by recovery of α-factor sensitivity following plasmid loss on media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid. Plasmids conferring α-factor resistance were isolated from yeast cells and sequenced. The same pool of mutagenized DNA was also subjected to a screen for STE18 dominant-negative mutations in which wild-type cells (RK5111–6B) were transformed with the library, and random colonies were picked and screened for impaired response to α-factor in growth arrest (halo) assays. Pheromone Response Assays—Long term (48 h) pheromone-induced growth arrest (halo) assays were used to determine the ability of cells to respond to varying concentrations of agonist (α-factor) as described previously (27McCaffrey G. Clay F.J. Kelsay K. Sprague Jr., G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2680-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Sterile paper disks containing various amounts of synthetic agonist (α-factor; 15 pmol, 50 pmol, 150 pmol, 500 pmol, 1.5 nmol) were applied to lawns of cells embedded in soft agar. After incubation at 30 °C for 2 days, zones of growth inhibition were measured, and plates were scanned electronically to record images. Unless indicated otherwise, halo assays were performed with ste18Δ cells expressing various wild-type or mutant STE18 alleles from the ADH or PGK promoter on high copy plasmids. Although various STE18 homologs and S. cerevisiae STE18 alleles were expressed from strong promoters on high copy plasmids, this would not result in overexpression of Gαβγ complexes, because Gα and Gβ subunits were expressed from their normal chromosomal loci and therefore were limiting. Quantitative Mating Assays—Cells were grown to mid-log phase in synthetic media lacking leucine to select for plasmids. Approximately 1 × 107 cells of the tester strain of the appropriate mating type and 2 × 106 cells of the experimental strain (a ste18Δ mutant of either mating type that expressed various STE18 alleles from plasmids) were mixed, collected on 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters, incubated for 3 h at 30 °C on YPD media, suspended, diluted, and plated in triplicate on appropriate media to select for diploids. The number of viable haploids of the experimental strains present before mating was quantified by plating on appropriate selective media. Mating efficiency (%) was calculated by dividing the number of diploids produced by the number of haploids of the limiting strain and multiplying by 100. Immunoblotting—Yeast cells were grown to mid-log phase and harvested, and total cell protein was extracted by performing an alkaline lysis procedure (28Holly S.P. Blumer K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 845-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (16% gel), transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked in 5% non-fat milk in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST). Blots were incubated with the HA.11 monoclonal antibody (BAbCO) diluted 1:1000 in PBST, washed, and incubated with a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Cappel) diluted 1:2000 in PBST, washed, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) with x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Ste18 Homologs from Divergent Yeast Species Can Functionally Replace S. cerevisiae Ste18 —As an initial means of investigating whether the C-terminal domain preceding the CAAX box of Ste18 is required for receptor-G protein coupling and signaling in vivo, we determined whether the complete signaling defect of cells lacking Ste18 could be corrected by plasmid-mediated expression of Ste18 homologs encoded by five diverged species of budding yeast whose genomes have been sequenced completely (29Cliften P.F. Hillier L.W. Fulton L. Graves T. Miner T. Gish W.R. Waterston R.H. Johnston M. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). 2M. Johnston, personal communication. Two factors indicated that this would be a useful approach. First, because Ste18 is the only Gγ subunit in S. cerevisiae, the function of Ste18 homologs from other yeast species could be examined in the absence of S. cerevisiae Ste18 because of deletion of the chromosomal STE18 locus. Second, BLASTX searches indicated that the genome of each yeast species encoded a single Ste18 homolog with a relatively conserved Gβ binding domain (central two-thirds of the molecule) and a more highly diverged C-terminal sequence in the putative receptor coupling domain immediately preceding the CAAX box (Fig. 1). These analyses indicated that the Ste18 homologs of S. bayanus, S. kudriavzevii, and S. mikatae are most similar to S. cerevisiae Ste18 (∼85% identity overall), whereas the Ste18 homologs of S. castellii and S. kluyveri are more highly diverged (57 and 50% identity, respectively). Despite exhibiting varying degrees of sequence conservation in their putative receptor coupling domains, all of the Ste18 homologs could correct the signaling defect of S. cerevisiae cells carrying a disruption of the chromosomal STE18 gene. As indicated by quantitative assays of agonist (α-factor)-induced growth arrest (Fig. 2), expression of Ste18 homologs most similar to S. cerevisiae Ste18 (S. bayanus, S. mikatae,or S. kudriavzevii) fully restored agonist responsiveness to the S. cerevisiae ste18Δ mutant (zones of α-factor-induced growth inhibition were equivalent to those of ste18Δ cells expressing the S. cerevisiae STE18 gene from a plasmid). More strikingly, expression of either of the more highly diverged Ste18 homologs (S. kluyveri and S. castellii) nearly completely restored agonist responsiveness to the ste18Δ mutant (zones of growth inhibition were slightly smaller or turbid). Because the C-terminal domains of these latter two Ste18 homologs are quite diverged relative to S. cerevisiae Ste18, these results suggested that specific amino acid sequences or motifs preceding the CAAX box of Ste18 may not be critical for receptor-G protein coupling and signaling. Missense Mutations Affecting the C-terminal Domain of Ste18 Preserve Receptor-dependent Signaling—To provide an independent means of investigating whether C-terminal peptide sequences preceding the CAAX box of S. cerevisiae Ste18 are important for receptor-mediated signaling, we constructed and analyzed several types of missense mutations affecting this domain. We first used alanine scanning mutagenesis targeted to residues 99–105, just upstream of the CCAAX box (residues 106–110), which is prenylated and palmitoylated and required for activation of the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (30Whiteway M.S. Thomas D.Y. Genetics. 1994; 137: 967-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hirschman J.E. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7705-7711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Manahan C.L. Patnana M. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 957-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Pairs of residues were substituted with an Ala-Ala dipeptide to create six mutants (M99A,S100A; S100A,N101A; N101A,S102A; S102A,N103A; N103A,S104A; S104A,V105A) that were analyzed for their ability to function when expressed from a plasmid in a ste18Δ mutant. As indicated by quantitative assays of agonist-induced growth arrest, expression of each of these alleles in a ste18Δ mutant resulted in wild-type or nearly wild-type response to agonist (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the side chains of residues 99–105 are dispensable for receptor-mediated signaling. As an alternative to alanine scanning mutagenesis, we altered the charge distribution of selected residues within the C-terminal domain of Ste18. In one mutant, lysine 95 was changed to aspartic acid, and in another mutant three uncharged residues (Met-99, Ser-100, Asn-101) were all changed to aspartic acid. Expression of either of these mutants from a plasmid in cells carrying a deletion of the chromosomal STE18 locus fully restored agonist-dependent signaling (Fig. 3B), further suggesting that specific amino acid sequences in the C-terminal domain of Ste18 are not essential for receptor coupling and signaling in vivo. Although suggestive, the preceding results could not exclude the possibility that the C-terminal domain of Ste18 contains several sequences or motifs that mediate receptor coupling in a functionally redundant manner. To address this possibility, we introduced a string of four alanine residues at positions 94–97 and 102–105 or eight alanine residues at positions 98–105. Strikingly, expression of any of these STE18 alleles from a plasmid fully rescued the ability of a ste18Δ mutant to respond to agonist (Fig. 3C). We also considered that Ste18 containing a string of eight alanine residues (positions 98–105) preceding the CAAX box could cause a quantitative defect in receptor-mediated signaling that was difficult to detect by in vivo signaling assays. Therefore, to increase the sensitivity of these assays we expressed plasmid-borne STE18 alleles in a ste18Δ mutant that expressed α-factor receptors lacking their C-terminal domains. Receptors lacking their C-terminal tail were used, because they are partially impaired for G protein coupling in vitro (33Dosil M. Schandel K.A. Gupta E. Jenness D.D. Konopka J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5321-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which is manifested in vivo by zones of agonist-induced growth inhibition that are slightly turbid and have less distinct margins (Fig. 3D). Despite this partial impairment in function, truncated α-factor receptors signaled with similar efficiency whether wild-type Ste18 or mutant Ste18 containing eight alanine residues was expressed from a plasmid in ste18Δ cells (Fig. 3D). Therefore, this mutant form of Ste18 appeared to be highly functional even when receptor-G protein coupling was partially impaired by other mechanisms. Mutations throughout Sequences Encoding the C-terminal Domain Preserve Ste18 Function—To address whether receptor coupling information is present elsewhere within the C-terminal domain of Ste18, we performed random oligonucleotide mutagenesis of sequences encoding residues 79–110. Sequences further upstream were spared, because they probably are required for association with Gβ, as suggested by structural studies of mammalian Gβγ complexes (34Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). A pool of plasmids created by random oligonucleotide mutagenesis of this region contained point and frameshift mutations as indicated by sequencing random clones (data not shown). This plasmid pool was subjected to two types of analyses to identify mutations that potentially"
