These macroporous materials are a new class of photonic band gap crystals for the optical spectrum. Scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and optical microscopy confirm the quality of the samples, and optical reflectivity demonstrates that the crystals are strongly photonic and near that needed to exhibit band gap behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2124713665,"The small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) Cdc42 and Rac1 regulate E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell adhesion. IQGAP1, a target of Cdc42 and Rac1, was localized with E-cadherin and β-catenin at sites of cell-cell contact in mouse L fibroblasts expressing E-cadherin (EL cells), and interacted with E-cadherin and β-catenin both in vivo and in vitro. IQGAP1 induced the dissociation of α-catenin from a cadherin-catenin complex in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of IQGAP1 in EL cells, but not in L cells expressing an E-cadherin–α-catenin chimeric protein, resulted in a decrease in E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell adhesive activity. Thus, IQGAP1, acting downstream of Cdc42 and Rac1, appears to regulate cell-cell adhesion through the cadherin-catenin pathway."

Dopamine and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein (32 kilodaltons) (DARPP-32), which is enriched in all neurons that receive a dopaminergic input, is converted in response to dopamine into a potent protein phosphatase inhibitor. Mice generated to contain a targeted disruption of the DARPP-32 gene showed profound deficits in their molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral responses to dopamine, drugs of abuse, and antipsychotic medication. The results show that DARPP-32 plays a central role in regulating the efficacy of dopaminergic neurotransmission."

Mechanisms by which CaMKII is targeted to its postsynaptic substrates are poorly understood. Previous gel overlay analyses revealed a candidate PSD-associated CaMKII-anchoring protein, p190, that binds selectively to the Thr286-autophosphorylated kinase ([P-T286]CaMKIIα) (16McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The NR2A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor share several properties with this CaMKII-binding activity, including apparent size, enrichment in PSDs, and regional and developmental expression profiles 2S.

Here, we demonstrate a direct and specific interaction between [P-T286]CaMKIIα and NR2B and show that NR2B targets CaMKII in intact cells. PSD isolation and immunoprecipitation of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-solubilized PSD proteins were carried out as described (6Strack S. Choi S. Lovinger D.M. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13467-13470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) using 2 μg/ml NR2A/B antibodies (Chemicon) and protein phosphatase 1 antibodies (18Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). For CaMKII·NMDA receptor coimmunoprecipitation, PSDs (1 mg/ml) were cross-linked (45 min, 4 °C) with 0.25 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl suberate), dissolved by sonication in 2% SDS, and diluted 15-fold in 1% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μm microcystin-LR. The supernatant after ultracentrifugation (30 min, 100,000 × g) was immunoprecipitated with 3 μg/ml goat anti-CaMKII (16McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or preimmune IgG (19Colbran R.J. Bass M.A. McNeill R.B. Bollen M. Zhao S. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cross-linker was cleaved and proteins eluted from the beads by boiling in reducing SDS sample buffer. Purified recombinant CaMKIIα was autophosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP (8,000–40,000 cpm/pmol) in the presence of calcium/calmodulin or EGTA at Thr286 or Thr305/306, respectively, and desalted (16McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Stoichiometries ranged between 0.17 and 0.39 (Thr286) and 0.24 and 0.47 (Thr305/306). Protein blots to be analyzed for CaMKII binding were blocked and incubated with 100–200 nm [32P]CaMKII in 5% milk for 3 h, washed extensively, and autoradiographed. 18-Day-old cultures of dissociated neonatal rat cortex were fixed in acetone:methanol (1:1), blocked, and incubated 10–14 h in 1:500 dilutions of goat anti-CaMKII (16McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-NR1 (20Rema V. Ebner F.F. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 368: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and mouse anti-synaptophysin (Boehringer Mannheim) in 1% normal donkey serum, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. Cultures were treated with species-specific donkey antibodies conjugated to Cy3, Cy2, and Cy5 (Jackson Laboratories) and imaged on a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope. The entire cytoplasmic domains (C terminus starting immediately after transmembrane region IV) of NR1 (splice variant A containing both C1 and C2 exon cassettes), NR2A, and NR2B subunits, as well as shorter NR2B constructs, were subcloned from full-length cDNAs by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase and primers containing restrictions sites or by restriction digests. Fragments were sequenced and ligated into pRSET-A His6 tag (Qiagen) or pGEX-2T glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) fusion vectors. His6 tag fusions were expressed, and GST fusions were expressed and purified according to the manufacturers' instructions. His6 tag fusion protein lysates were subjected to CaMKII overlay (see above) or immunoblotted with anti His6 tag antibodies (CLONTECH) and 125I-labeled secondary antibodies for expression levels, followed by PhosphorImager quantification. Ni2+-coated 96-well plates (HisSorb strips, Qiagen) were adsorbed for 2 h with soluble His6 tag NR2B fusion protein expressing or nonexpressing bacterial extracts (0.25 mg/ml) in blocking buffer (5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). After extensive washes, [32P-T286]CaMKIIα diluted in blocking buffer (200 μl) was allowed to bind to the tethered fusion protein for 2 h, followed by 10–12 more washes. Bound CaMKII was solubilized in 1% SDS, 0.2 n NaOH, 50 mm EDTA, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding to control bacterial extracts was subtracted from total binding to obtain specific binding. No specific binding was observed using [32P-T306]CaMKIIα. GST fusion proteins were incubated (1 h, 4 °C) with either purified CaMKIIα (Fig. 2 D, see caption) or with a freshly prepared rat brain cytosolic extract (∼3 mg/ml extract protein, 10 μg/ml GST fusion protein) containing 2 μm microcystin-LR and 0.5% Triton X-100, precipitated with glutathione-agarose, washed extensively, and eluted with SDS sample buffer. CaMKIV antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. HEK293 cells were seeded on coverslips in 35-mm dishes, transfected with a total of 3 μg/dish DNA (1 μg of SRα promotor-CaMKIIα expression plasmid, 2 μg of cytomegalovirus promotor plasmids with NMDA receptor subunits at a mass ratio of 1:3 NR1a and NR2A/B subunits), and grown for 48 h as described (21Lovinger D.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 164-172PubMed Google Scholar). Robust expression of NMDA currents was verified by patch-clamp recording of parallel cultures. 3R. L. Popp and D. M. Lovinger, personal communication. Cells were washed and incubated in Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced saline containing 2 mm CaCl2 and either the NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV, 50 μm) or NMDA/glycine (100/10 μm) for 15 min. Cultures were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence (see above) using 1:500 antibody dilutions of goat anti-CaMKII (16McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), mouse anti-NR1 (PharMingen), and rabbit anti-NR2A/B (Chemicon). Between 2 and 5% of cells were strongly positive for at least one label; only those cells expressing high levels of each antigen (>50% of transfected cells) were included in the analyses. Under basal conditions, CaMKIIα expression was diffusely cytoplasmic. Irrespective of agonist treatment, NR1 and NR2A/B strictly colocalized (mean scores >3.4, see below) in a patchy or reticular, often perinuclear pattern as seen previously in heterologous cells (22Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Cultures were randomized prior to sampling digital images on a confocal microscope to prevent operator bias. Coded images (as in Fig. 3) were assigned a colocalization score by a second, naive observer: 0, mutual exclusion; 1, coincidental overlap; 2 or 3, increasing degrees of colocalization, 4, complete overlap of labels. For reference, the cells in Fig. 3 scored a 0, 1, 2, 2, and a 3 (from left to right, top tobottom). To determine whether NR2 subunits contribute to the previously characterized “p190” overlay binding activity (16McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we analyzed immunoprecipitated NR2A/B by gel overlay with [32P-T286]CaMKIIα (Fig.1 A). A CaMKII-binding activity comigrating with NR2A and NR2B was immunoprecipitated with NR2A/B antibodies, but not control antibodies, indicating that NR2A and/or NR2B are CaMKII-binding proteins. This interaction may be physiologically relevant, because triple immunofluorescent labeling of cultured cortical neurons demonstrated that CaMKII colocalizes with NMDA receptors in many punctae along dendritic shafts, identified as synapses by the adjacent or overlapping presence of synaptophysin (Fig. 1 B). Higher magnification revealed a mostly postsynaptic localization of CaMKII in dendritic spines (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, a complex of CaMKII with NMDA receptor subunits can be immunoprecipitated from PSDs using CaMKII antibodies, but not preimmune IgG (Fig. 1 D). NR2B was more efficiently coprecipitated than NR1, likely because association of CaMKII with NR1 is indirect (i.e. via NR2B, see below). Recovery of the receptor-kinase complex required pretreatment of PSDs with a reversible cross-linker prior to essentially complete PSD solubilization in 2% SDS, indicating that the interaction of CaMKII with NMDA receptors is not stable in harsh detergents. The specificity of the cross-linking procedure was demonstrated by the absence of other abundant PSD proteins in the immunoprecipitate, including the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (Fig. 1 D). NMDA receptor subunits have a common transmembrane topology with three membrane-spanning regions and a C-terminal tail of variable length, which forms the intracellular portion of the receptor (Fig.2 A, diagram). Bacterial lysates expressing the cytoplasmic domains of the predominant forebrain NMDA receptor subunits, NR1, NR2A, and NR2B, as His6 tag fusion proteins were screened for [32P]CaMKIIα binding by overlay (Fig. 2 A). The NR2B cytoplasmic domain bound about six times more [32P-T286]CaMKIIα than the corresponding region of NR2A; neither NR1 nor any endogenous bacterial proteins showed detectable binding. Interactions with NR2A and NR2B were specific for autonomously active CaMKII, as CaMKIIα phosphorylated in the absence of calcium/calmodulin at Thr305/306 ([P-T306]CaMKIIα) bound only weakly (<5%). Because NR2B displayed the most robust interaction with CaMKII, we mapped its CaMKII-binding domain by creating a series of truncation and internal deletion constructs. Only constructs containing NR2B residues 1260–1309 showed CaMKII binding similar to the full-length cytoplasmic tail. Fusion of NR2B-(1260–1309) to GST demonstrated that this domain is also sufficient for interaction with autonomous CaMKII (Fig.2 B). A solution interaction assay was employed to examine binding of CaMKII to NR2B that had not undergone denaturation/renaturation for gel overlay analysis. [32P-T286]CaMKIIα bound saturably to a His6 tag NR2B fusion protein containing residues 1260–1309, but not to a construct that starts at residue 1310, C-terminal of this domain (Fig. 2 C). Scatchard analysis indicated that binding involves a simple bimolecular interaction with aKd of 138 ± 60 nm(n = 3) (Fig. 2 C, inset). ThisKd is ∼100 times lower than the average concentration of CaMKIIα in forebrain (16McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Erondu N.E. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 3270-3277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction can readily occur in neurons. The CaMKII-binding domain in NR2B contains a high-affinity phosphorylation site, Ser1303, which is phosphorylated by CaMKII in vitro and is also phosphorylated in vivo (13Omkumar R.V. Kiely M.J. Rosenstein A.J. Min K.T. Kennedy M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31670-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, three lines of evidence indicate that the binding of CaMKII to NR2B-(1260–1309) is not dependent on a substrate interaction. First, the model peptide substrate syntide-2 only weakly inhibits CaMKII binding (∼30%) at concentrations of ∼100-fold theKm for phosphorylation (not shown). Second, even though NR2A residues 1255–1298 are 36% identical to NR2B-(1260–1309), and sequences surrounding the phosphorylation site are almost perfectly conserved (NR2B, LRRQHSYD; NR2A, INRQHSYD) (13Omkumar R.V. Kiely M.J. Rosenstein A.J. Min K.T. Kennedy M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31670-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), CaMKII binding to NR2A-(1255–1298) is ∼10-fold weaker under our overlay conditions (10.7 ± 1.8%,n = 3, Fig. 2 B), suggesting that nonconserved residues in NR2B-(1260–1309) are important for high-affinity CaMKII binding. Third, “pull-down” experiments, in which GST-NR2B fusion protein was purified with glutathione-agarose, showed that calcium/calmodulin alone did not promote CaMKII interaction with NR2B, but that stoichiometric interaction was instead strictly dependent on CaMKIIα autophosphorylation at Thr286 (Fig. 2 D). On the other hand, calcium/calmodulin binding is sufficient for full CaMKII activation, and Thr286 autophosphorylation stabilizes the active conformation of the kinase in the absence of calcium/calmodulin (1Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 2Soderling T.R. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1995; 30: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, CaMKII residues outside the substrate binding site are involved in the interaction with NR2B. Further evidence for specific association of CaMKII with NR2B was obtained by performing GST-NR2B pull-downs from brain cytosolic extracts. α and β isoforms of CaMKII were isolated following incubation with GST-NR2B-(1260–1309), but not GST alone. Affinity-purified CaMKIIα displayed an upward electrophoretic mobility shift characteristic of autophosphorylation (Fig.2 E). CaM kinase IV, a related kinase with a similar phosphorylation site preference (24White R.R. Kwon Y.-G. Taing M. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3166-3179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), as well as other kinases and phosphatases tested, were not detected in the precipitated material, strongly indicating that NR2B-(1260–1309) binds selectively to CaMKII. The NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor was shown to target Thr286 autophosphorylated CaMKII in HEK293 cells. CaMKIIα was coexpressed with various NMDA receptor subunit combinations, and their distributions were compared by immunofluorescence (Fig.3). Whereas NR1 alone does not form functional NMDA receptors in HEK293 cells, activation of both NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B receptors leads to massive calcium influx (25Grant E.R. Bacskai B.J. Pleasure D.E. Pritchett D.B. Gallagher M.J. Kendrick S.J. Kricka L.J. Lynch D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 647-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Coexpression of CaMKIIα and NR1 alone resulted in low colocalization scores that were unaffected by acute treatment with the receptor coagonists NMDA/glycine (Fig. 3 A). Perhaps reflecting the low but detectable CaMKII binding activity of NR2A (Fig. 2,A and B), additional expression of the NR2A subunit led to a small increase in CaMKIIα and NR1/NR2A colocalization, which was not significantly increased by NMDA/glycine treatment (Fig. 3 B). In cells expressing NR2B with CaMKIIα and NR1, we observed a similarly modest increase in colocalization in the absence of agonist treatment compared with CaMKIIα and NR1 alone (Fig. 3, C and D). In contrast to NR2A-containing NMDA receptors, activation of NR1/NR2B receptors with NMDA/glycine caused a highly significant redistribution of CaMKIIα into receptor-positive patches (Fig. 3, C and D), strongly suggesting that receptor activation induced the formation of a CaMKII·NR2B complex. Replacing extracellular calcium with barium, which is receptor-permeable but binds only poorly to calmodulin, completely blocked the effect of NMDA (Fig. 3 D). Thus, opening of NMDA receptors is not sufficient for complex formation, but calcium influx is essential, presumably to stimulate calcium/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation of CaMKII. Consistent with this interpretation, an autophosphorylation-incompetent form of the kinase, T286A-CaMKIIα (26Fong Y.L. Taylor W.L. Means A.R. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16759-16763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hanson P.I. Kapiloff M.S. Lou L.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Schulman H. Neuron. 1989; 3: 59-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), expressed at similar levels of wild-type CaMKIIα failed to show activity-induced colocalization with NR1/NR2B containing NMDA receptors (Fig.3 D). Thus, NR2B mediates targeting of CaMKII to NMDA receptors in a calcium- and Thr286autophosphorylation-dependent manner in intact cells. Our data support a model in which dendritic calcium influx induced by synaptic activity triggers CaMKII autophosphorylation at Thr286 and subsequent binding to residues 1260–1309 in the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. What are the functional consequences of this interaction? Autonomous CaMKII in the PSD is inactivated by PSD-associated serine/threonine phosphatases (18Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 28Shields S.M. Ingebritsen T.S. Kelly P.T. J.

Once dephosphorylated at Thr286, CaMKII positioned near the mouth of the NMDA receptor calcium channel is likely to undergo rapid re-autophosphorylation even during periods of low level NMDA receptor activation. Thus, an interaction of CaMKII with NMDA receptors is predicted to boosts autonomous kinase activity, leading to enhanced phosphorylation of nearby downstream effectors of synaptic plasticity (15Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recruitment of CaMKII into the PSD structure (6Strack S. Choi S. Lovinger D.M. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13467-13470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), possibly via association with NR2B, may play a role in the rapid ultrastructural changes of synapses that undergo LTP (30Geinisman Y. deToledo-Morrell L.

A. 1996; 93: 8040-8045Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The developmental appearance of NR2A and down-regulation of NR2B in the mammalian visual system correlate with the end of the “critical period” of synapse maturation (32Flint A.C.

Half of the RyR1 channels are activated by voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channels in the plasma membrane. In planar lipid bilayers, RyR1 channels exhibited simultaneous openings and closings, termed “coupled gating.” Addition of the channel accessory protein FKBP12 induced coupled gating, and removal of FKBP12 uncoupled channels. Coupled gating provides a mechanism by which RyR1 channels that are not associated with voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channels can be regulated."

Dephosphorylation of rat brain extract was shown to promote the assembly of dynamin 1, synaptojanin 1, and amphiphysin into complexes that also included clathrin and AP-2. Phosphorylation of dynamin 1 and synaptojanin 1 inhibited their binding to amphiphysin, whereas phosphorylation of amphiphysin inhibited its binding to AP-2 and clathrin. Thus, phosphorylation regulates the association and dissociation cycle of the clathrin-based endocytic machinery, and calcium-dependent dephosphorylation of endocytic proteins could prepare nerve terminals for a burst of endocytosis."

Loss-of-heterozygosity studies in melanoma have suggested the presence of at least one chromosome 10q locus lost early in tumor progression. In this study, we screened 45 melanoma cell lines and 17 paired uncultured metastatic melanoma and peripheral blood specimens for PTEN/ MMAC1 alterations using PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing. We found nine melanoma cell lines with homozygous deletions (five with intragenic loss) and four cell lines with mutations (one nonsense and one frameshift; two intronic); from among our uncultured melanoma specimens, we found one tumor with a somatic 17 bp duplication in exon 7 leading to a premature stop codon and one tumor with a possible homozygous deletion. Furthermore, we have identified a novel intragenic polymorphism within intron 4 of PTEN/MMAC1. Taken together, these data suggest that PTEN/MMAC1 may be a chromosome 10q tumor suppressor important in melanoma tumor formation or progression."

To further characterize the effects of VEGF-A in skin in vivo, we have developed transgenic mice expressing the mouse VEGF120 under the control of a 2.4 kb 5′ fragment of keratin K6 gene regulatory sequences that confers transgene inducibility upon hyperproliferative stimuli. As expected from the inducible nature of the transgene, two of the three founder mice obtained (V27 and V208), showed no apparent phenotype. However, one founder (V2), mosaic for transgene integration, developed scattered red spots throughout the skin at birth. The transgenic offspring derived from this founder developed a striking phenotype characterized by swelling and erythema, resulting in early postnatal lethality. Histological examination of the skin of these transgenics demonstrated highly increased vascularization and edema leading to disruption of skin architecture. Expression of the transgene was silent in adult animals of lines derived from founders V27 and V208. Phorbol ester-induced hyperplasia resulted in transgene induction and increased cutaneous vascularization in adult transgenic mice of these lines. Skin carcinogenesis experiments performed on hemizygous crosses of V208 mice with activated H-ras-carrying transgenic mice (TG.AC) resulted in accelerated papilloma development and increased tumor burden. Previous results from our laboratory showed that VEGF upregulation is a major angiogenic stimulus in mouse epidermal carcinogenesis. By overexpressing VEGF in the skin of transgenic mice we now move a step further toward showing that VEGF-mediated angiogenesis is a rate-limiting step in the genesis of premalignant lesions, such as mouse skin papilloma. Our transgenic mice constitute an interesting model system for in vivo study of the cutaneous angiogenic process and its relevance in tumorigenesis and other skin diseases."

Levels of the clock protein FRQ were measured in Neurospora at various temperatures; at higher temperatures, the amount of FRQ oscillated around higher levels. Absolute FRQ amounts thus identified different times at different temperatures, so temperature shifts corresponded to shifts in clock time without immediate synthesis or turnover of components. Moderate temperature changes could dominate light-to-dark shifts in the influence of circadian timing. Temperature regulation of clock components could explain temperature resetting of rhythms and how single transitions can initiate rhythmicity from characteristic circadian phases."

https://openalex.org/W2317624627,"Cells expressing the R273H mutant of p53, which lacks sequence specific DNA binding capacity, do not undergo cell cycle arrest in G1 following exposure to ionizing or UV radiation because of their inability to induce p21Waf1/Cip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and downstream mediator of p53-dependent DNA damage-induced growth arrest. Following UV-irradiation or treatment with an inhibitor of RNA pol II, we observed a rapid induction of the apoptotic process, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation and the proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Using mimosine, a p21Waf1/Cip1 inducer that bypasses the requirement for transcriptional transactivation by p53, we demonstrated that a G1 cell cycle arrest can prevent apoptosis following UV-irradiation or treatment with an RNA polymerase II inhibitor. Serum starvation, which also synchronized cells in G1 but did not induce p21Waf1/Cip1, did not protect cells from apoptosis. These results demonstrate that restoring a late G1 checkpoint by inducing p21Waf1/Cip1 expression can protect cells from DNA damage induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that p21Waf1/Cip1 can interrupt the apoptotic process at a point downstream from p53 accumulation but upstream from caspase-3 activation."

To examine whether memory retrieval can be regulated by top-down processes originating from the prefrontal cortex, a visual associative memory task was introduced into the partial split-brain paradigm in monkeys. Long-term memory acquired through stimulus-stimulus association did not transfer via the anterior corpus callosum, a key part interconnecting prefrontal cortices. Nonetheless, when a visual cue was presented to one hemisphere, the anterior callosum could instruct the other hemisphere to retrieve the correct stimulus specified by the cue. Thus, although visual long-term memory is stored in the temporal cortex, memory retrieval is under the executive control of the prefrontal cortex."

In a memory device, independent switching of the magnetically soft layer is achieved by making the other layer either exchange-biased or magnetically hard. The repeated reversal of M of the soft layer by field cycling can demagnetize the other magnetically hard layer and thus erase the tunnel junction's memory. The M of exchange-biased structures was stable at least to 10 7 cycles, whereas in hard structures, M generally decayed logarithmically with the number of field cycles. The decay was very sensitive to the thickness of the hard layer and the composition of the soft layer. However, no decay was observed when the moment reversal was accomplished by coherent rotation, establishing that demagnetization results from the formation and motion of domain walls in the soft layer during field cycling."

In transgenic mice expressing an alphabeta TCR lacking the alpha-CPM, thymocytes were blocked in positive selection but could undergo negative selection. Thus, the alpha-CPM seems to participate in the generation of signals required for positive selection."

A large proportion of neuroblastomas is characterized by amplification of MYCN. Using human neuroblastoma cells harbouring tetracycline controlled expression of MYCN we have analysed the role of the MycN protein and IFNgamma in cell death decision. Neither conditional expression of MYCN nor treatment with IFNgamma alone was sufficient to trigger cell death. However, when acting in concert MycN and IFNgamma efficiently triggered cell death, which was accompanied by DNA fragmentation and required caspase activity, two hallmarks of apoptosis. MycN and IFNgamma may cooperate along at least two different pathways. First, IFNgamma increased the CD95 cell surface expression while MycN enhanced the cellular susceptibility for the CD95 mediated death signal. Second, IFNgamma treatment induced expression of BAK mRNA while MycN and IFNgamma in combination increased the amount of Bax protein, another activator of apoptosis, without a concomitant increase in BAX mRNA. MycN also increased cell death in response to TRAIL and TNFalpha, suggesting that enforced MYCN expression in general increases the susceptibility of neuroblastoma cells towards a variety of death stimuli."

This report describes experiments designed to elucidate the mechanism of cyclin D1 inhibition and to determine whether inhibition of cyclin D1 expression is the cause, rather than the result, of TGF-β1-mediated cell cycle arrest. TGF-β1 inhibition of IEC-6 cell proliferation was associated with a decrease in the abundance of cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes and a corresponding decrease in Cdk4-dependent phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. Metabolic labeling studies indicated that TGF-β1 inhibited cyclin D1 synthesis without altering the rate of cyclin D1 protein degradation. Cyclin D1 antisense oligonucleotides blocked serum-stimulated induction of cyclin D1 and DNA synthesis, whereas cyclin D1 sense oligonucleotides had no effect. RIE-1 cells were engineered to overexpress human cyclin D1 under the control of a tetracycline-repressible promoter. These cells entered S phase in the presence of TGF-β1 only when human cyclin D1 was derepressed by the withdrawal of tetracycline. These data indicate that TGF-β1 inhibits the synthesis of cyclin D1 in gut epithelial cells and that this inhibition is the cause, rather than the result, of TGF-β1-mediated arrest of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation."

Two of them, HuR and AUF1, bind specifically to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of c-myc mRNA. Because c-myc is regulated post-transcriptionally in various mouse tissues, including quiescent tissues, fetal liver and regenerating liver, we investigated whether HuR and AUF1 expression was also regulated in these tissues. Concerning AUF1, we analysed the expression of various mRNA and protein isoforms. We discovered a new AUF1 mRNA variant with a long AU-rich 3' UTR. We show that AUF1 expression, regardless of the RNA isoform considered, and HuR mRNA expression parallel c-myc expression in quiescent tissues and during liver development; their expression is high in lymphoid tissues and fetal liver and low in adult liver. However, no upregulation of HuR or AUF1 accompanies the upregulation of c-myc mRNA following partial hepatectomy.

We reasoned prostaglandin formation and in turn a cAMP increase as the underlying protective principle. Here we report that exposure of macrophages to lipopolysaccharide/interferon-γ or lipophilic cAMP analogs such as dibutyryl-cAMP or 8-bromo-cAMP for 15 h attenuated DNA fragmentation and accumulation of the tumor suppressor p53 in response to the chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin and etoposide, compared to cells that received chemotherapeutic agents only. In contrast, a 1 h lasting preexposure period revealed no protection. The demand for a long incubation period with cAMP-derivates implied cAMP-mediated gene activation as the underlying principle. Therefore, we treated cells with oligonucleotides containing a cAMP-response element (CRE) binding site. Using this decoy-approach we scavanged activated cAMP response element binding protein prior to its promoter activating ability. Incubating macrophages with decoy, but not with control oligonucleotides, reduced cAMP evoked protection and simultanously restored p53 accumulation in response to chemotherapeutic agents. Our studies demonstrate that cAMP-initiated gene activation regulates the sensitivity towards DNA damaging agents via inhibition of a p53 dependent pathway."

The muscle creatine kinase (MCK) gene whose transcription is induced during muscle differentiation contains p53-binding sites. In this study we tested the involvement of p53 in the activation of MCK transcription during muscle differentiation of C2 cells. We have shown that the p53 protein is stabilized and its DNA binding and transcriptional activities are induced during muscle differentiation. At the stage of muscle-differentiation, p53 protein can induce the accurate transcription of a minimal p53-dependent MCK reporter gene. Moreover, p53 cooperates with MyoD in the induction of MCK transcription. The expression of a dominant negative p53 protein in muscle cells reduced the expression of endogenous MCK gene. The dominant negative p53 protein abolished the cooperativity of wild type p53 with MyoD. Amino and carboxy terminal residues of MyoD required for the cooperation with p53 in transcription were identified. The cooperativity between the two proteins occurs also at the stage of DNA binding. We suggest that p53 protein is activated during myoblast differentiation and participates with MyoD in the induction of MCK transcription."

A significant increase of Fra-1 and JunB protein levels was detected in all oncogene transformed rat thyroid cell lines. Fra-1 gene induction was demonstrated to occur also in human thyroid carcinoma cell lines and tissues. Conversely, c-Jun and JunD proteins, rather than JunB, accumulated in human thyroid carcinoma cell lines. An induction of AP-1 target genes was also detected both in rat and human thyroid transformed cell lines. Therefore, in vivo and in vitro thyroid cell transformation is associated with important compositional changes in the AP-1 complex and an increased transcriptional activity."

Here we provide evidence that retention of tsp53 in the cytoplasm at the non-permissive temperature is due to cytoskeletal anchorage of the p53 protein. Two sublines of C6 rat glioma cells differing in their expression of the intermediate filament protein vimentin (vimentin expressing or vimentin negative cells) were stably transfected with a vector encoding tsp53. Whereas cells of vimentin expressing C6 subclones retained tsp53 in the cytoplasm at the non-permissive temperature, cells of vimentin negative subclones exclusively harbored the tsp53 within their nuclei. Intermediate filament deficient cells that had been reconstituted with a full length vimentin protein again showed a cytoplasmic localization of tsp53, whereas in cells expressing a C-terminally truncated (tail-less) vimentin tsp53 localized to the nucleus.

Their accumulation is transiently induced at the beginning of the G0-to-S phase transition in quiescent cells stimulated for growth. To address the mechanisms responsible for rapid clearance of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins under these experimental conditions, we have used the ts20 mouse embryo fibroblasts which express a thermosensitive mutant of the E1 enzyme of the ubiquitin pathway. The use of cell-permeant protease inhibitors indicates that both proteins are degraded by the proteasome and excludes any major contribution for calpains and lysosomes during the G0-to-S phase transition. Synchronisation of ts20 cells at the non permissive temperature blocks the degradation of c-Jun, indicating that this process is E1-dependent. In contrast, c-Fos is broken down according to an apparently E1-independent pathway in ts20 cells, although a role for ubiquitinylation in this process cannot be formally ruled out. Interestingly, c-Jun is highly unstable in c-Fos-null mouse embryo fibroblasts stimulated for growth. Taken together, these observations show that in vivo during a G0-to-S phase transition (i) the precise mechanisms triggering c-Fos and c-Jun directing to the proteasome are not identical, (ii) the presence of c-Fos is not an absolute prerequisite for the degradation of c-Jun and (iii) the degradation of c-Jun is not required for that of c-Fos."

Each 5 S rRNA type is transcribed from a distinct multigene family, and considerable research has focused on explaining the differential expression of these genes in somatic cells. Recently, it has been reported that histone acetylation enhances RNA polymerase III transcription of dinucleosomal 5 S rRNA gene templates (10Ura K. Kurumizaka H. Dimitrov S. Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2096-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for histone acetylation in 5 S rRNA transcription. It was also demonstrated that in a X. laevis kidney cell line transcribing low levels of oocyte 5 S rRNA, a small portion of oocyte genes were packaged with hyperacetylated histones (11Reynolds W.F.

Previously it has been reported that certainXenopus tissue culture cell lines express low levels of oocyte 5 S rRNA (8Ford P.J. Mathieson T. Nature. 1976; 261: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and thus it was necessary to determine whether the oocyte genes were truly repressed in the somatic cell line used in this investigation. To this end, total cellular RNA was isolated from tissue culture cells, resolved by partially denaturing PAGE, blotted, and probed with a sequence specific for the oocyte 5 S rRNA gene. Because of a six-nucleotide difference between the oocyte and somatic 5 S rRNAs, the two molecules migrate differently in this partially denaturing gel system. This can be seen by comparing lanes 1and 2 in Fig. 1, which show that the T7 polymerase transcribed somatic 5 S rRNA migrated faster than its oocyte counterpart. Lane 3 of Fig. 1 shows the results of Northern blot analysis of the total cellular RNA from theXenopus tissue culture cell line. The results show only one band, the migration of which closely resembled that of the somatic 5 S rRNA (Fig. 1, lane 1). No oocyte-like transcripts were observed. The lowest limit of detection of this analysis was ∼0.5 pg of 5 S rRNA. This, taken together with the fact that there are 50 times more oocyte than somatic genes, suggests that the oocyte genes are transcribed at a rate at least 5000-fold less than that of the somatic in this cell line. It must be noted that the T7 transcribed somatic 5 S rRNA migrated slightly slower than that isolated from the tissue culture cells. The T7 transcribed 5 S rRNAs were 121 nucleotides in length because of run-off transcription of a DraI-digested plasmid, whereas the native 5 S rRNAs are only 120 nucleotides. This extra nucleotide has been shown not to participate in the secondary structure of 5 S rRNA. The conclusion of these results is that in theXenopus tissue culture cell line used in this study, the oocyte genes are transcriptionally silent.In this investigation, an antibody specific for hyperacetylated histone H4 was used to immunoprecipitate chromatin fragments. This antibody, prepared as described previously (14Lin R Leone J.W. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1577-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), was raised against the first 20 amino acids of tetra-acetylated histone H4 from Tetrahymena, which differs significantly from that of Xenopus. To determine whether this antibody shows the same specificity for hyperacetylated Xenopus histone H4, a Western blot analysis was performed using histones from butyrate-treated HeLa cells (X. laevis histone H4 shares the identical first 20 amino acids with human H4). By comparing lane 1 of Fig.2 A, which shows Coomassie-stained histones, with the immunodetected histones inlane 2, it can be seen that the antibody used in this study strongly reacted with the di- to tetra-acetylated H4 but did not recognize nonacetylated H4. Thus this antibody would be expected to only immunoprecipitate nucleosomes packaged with hyperacetylated H4. To verify this, a control immunoprecipitation was performed. The starting samples for these control immunoprecipitations consisted of unlabeled, nonacetylated nucleosome cores (chicken erythrocyte) containing a 0.1% fraction of either radiolabeled acetylated or radiolabeled hypoacetylated HeLa cell nucleosome core particles. These samples were used to demonstrate that the antibody used in this study could selectively fractionate the hyperacetylated from the nonacetylated nucleosome cores as seen in Fig. 2 B.Figure 2A, Western blot analysis of hyperacetylated histones. Approximately 10 μg of histones isolated from butyrate-treated HeLa cells (fraction B) (16Ausió J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) were resolved by acetic acid/urea PAGE, blotted, and immunodetected with an antibody specific for Tetrahymena acetylated histone H4.

The total cpm of a one-tenth volume of the total immunoprecipitate was determined. A negative control immunoprecipitation of hyperacetylated nucleosomes was performed in the absence of antibody (acetylated −Ab).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Chromatin fragments isolated from the X. laevis kidney cell line were immunoprecipitated with an antibody recognizing hyperacetylated histone H4. The resulting nucleosomal DNA was deproteinized and probed by dot blot analysis for the presence of the oocyte or somatic 5 S rRNA gene repeats (Fig.3). Equal amounts of both the bound and unbound DNA fractions (αH4) were loaded as is demonstrated by hybridization with labeled total Xenopus DNA. When the antibody was omitted from the immunoprecipitation (−Ab) or replaced with nonspecific polysera (PS), very little signal was seen in the bound fraction when probing with totalXenopus DNA, indicating that immunoprecipitation was not because of nonspecific precipitation of nucleosomes. Because equal amounts of both the bound and unbound fractions were blotted, if the oocyte or somatic 5 S rRNA genes were packaged with acetylated histone H4, there would be an enrichment for these sequences in the immunoprecipitate, and a more intense signal for the bound fraction than that for the unbound. The results show that in the case of the somatic genes, there was an ∼5-fold enrichment for this sequence in the bound fraction, suggesting that the upstream nontranscribed sequence is packaged with hyperacetylated histones. In the case of the oocyte genes, although there was some signal, there was not an enrichment for the oocyte 5 S rRNA genes in the bound fraction. The fact that the signal for the bound is less intense than that of the unbound suggests that the upstream, nontranscribed sequence of the oocyte genes were selectively not precipitated, indicating that this region of the oocyte 5 S rRNA genes was not packaged with hyperacetylated histone H4. Assuming that the acetylation state of the spacer nucleosomes reflects that of any nucleosomes on the 5 S rRNA coding sequence, these results indicate that the transcriptionally active somatic 5 S rRNA genes are packaged with acetylated histones, whereas the transcriptionally silent oocyte genes in X. laevis are not. It should be noted that because the 5 S rRNA transcription complex spans a region greater than the 120 bp 5 S rRNA coding region (21Wolffe A.P. Morse R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4592-4599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Peck L.J. Bartilson M. DeRisi J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 11: 443-449Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), it would be unexpected for this complex to form without displacing any nucleosomes located on this sequence. This is supported by DNase I footprint analysis of 5 S rRNA genes containing transcription complexes in vivo (23Engelke D.R. Gottesfeld J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Chipev C.C. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that the transcriptionally active somatic 5 S rRNA genes used for this study have nucleosomes on the actual coding sequence.Figure 3Analysis by dot blot hybridization of DNA precipitated with anti-acetylated histone H4 antibodies. Fragmented chromatin isolated from the X. laevis K2 kidney cell line was immunoprecipitated with an anti-acetylated histone H4 antibody (αH4) or nonspecific polysera (PS) or without antibody (−Ab). The DNA was applied to a Zeta-Probe membrane and probed with radiolabeled genomic DNA or the upstream nontranscribed sequence of the oocyte or somatic 5 S rRNA genes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because the above results demonstrate that the transcriptionally silent oocyte 5 S rRNA genes were not packaged with hyperacetylated histone H4, this would seemingly suggest the presence of nonacetylated histones on these genes. To verify the presence of nucleosomes on these genes, tissue culture cell chromatin was digested with micrococcal nuclease and Southern blotted. If the upstream, nontranscribed sequence of the oocyte gene had a low abundance of nucleosomes, this region of DNA would be sensitive to micrococcal nuclease digestion. Fig.4 shows that this is not the case because digestion of the oocyte gene with micrococcal nuclease resulted in micrococcal nuclease-resistant fragments characteristic of the presence of nucleosomes on these genes, which has been shown by others (11Reynolds W.F. Smith R.D. Bloomer L.S. Gottesfeld J.M. Cell Nucleus. 1982; 11: 63-87Google Scholar, 23Engelke D.R. Gottesfeld J.M.

These results also show that the oocyte genes in this cell line were less sensitive to micrococcal digestion than the bulk of the chromatin because more time was required to produce the same extent of digestion (compare the third and fourth lanes of the ethidium bromide-stained gel in Fig. 4 A with those of the Southern blot in Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Southern blot hybridization of micrococcal nuclease digested nuclei from X. laevis K2 kidney cell line. Nuclei were digested for the times indicated with 4 units of micrococcal nuclease/μg DNA. Following nuclei lysis and DNA deproteinization, approximately 6-μg aliquots of DNA were resolved on a 1% agarose gel, ethidium bromide-stained, Southern blotted, and probed with the ∼360-bp upstream nontranscribed sequence of the oocyte 5 S rRNA gene.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous studies suggest that histone acetylation is one of the hallmarks of poised or potentially active genes (5Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Clayton A.L. Crane-Robinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Clayton A.L. Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Another well defined property of these regions is a general sensitivity to nucleases such as DNase I, DNase II, and micrococcal nuclease. In X. laevis somatic cells, the transcriptionally silent oocyte 5 S rRNA genes cannot be considered transcriptionally poised using these classifications because they are packaged with hypoacetylated histones and are less sensitive to micrococcal nuclease digestion than bulk chromatin. These results, taken together with those of others demonstrating the presence of acetylated histones on oocyte genes in cells in which oocyte 5 S rRNA is synthesized at low levels (11Reynolds W.F. Smith R.D. Bloomer L.S. Gottesfeld J.M. Cell Nucleus. 1982; 11: 63-87Google Scholar), suggest a link between histone acetylation and 5 S rRNA transcription. This is further supported by the fact that the transcriptionally active somatic 5 S rRNA genes are packaged with hyperacetylated histone H4. The repression of oocyte 5 S rRNA transcription in somatic cells is reportedly because of the presence of histone H1 and reduced levels of transcription factor IIIA (25Schlissel M.S. Brown D.D. Cell. 1984; 37: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26Wolffe A.P. Brown D.D. Science. 1988; 241: 1626-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 27Bouvet P. Dimitrov S. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1147-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The lack of histone acetylation in transcriptionally silent oocyte 5 S rRNA chromatin could then be explained by a blockage of a histone acetyltransferase activity by histone H1 or a requirement for the RNA polymerase III transcriptional machinery for the recruitment of this activity. The acetylation of lysine residues within the amino-terminal “tails” of core histones is known to be associated with transcriptionally active genes, although the basis of this relationship is not well understood (for reviews see Refs. 1Csordas A. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 2Turner B.M. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 13-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ausió J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar, 4Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). The use of antibodies, specific for hyperacetylated histones, to map core histone acetylation of active and inactive genes has suggested that acetylation is not a consequence but rather a precondition of transcription. It has been demonstrated in chicken embryonic erythrocytes, for example, that the β globin genes are packaged with acetylated histones prior to, during, and after activation during development (5Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Clayton A.L. Crane-Robinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the platelet-derived growth factor B chain gene is also found packaged with hyperacetylated histones prior to gene induction in a human hematopoietic stem cell line (6Clayton A.L. Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast to this apparent constitutive presence of acetylated histones on “poised” RNA polymerase II transcribed genes, transcriptionally silent 28 S rRNA 1The abbreviations used are: rRNAribosomal RNAbpbase pairPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: rRNAribosomal RNAbpbase pairPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. genes in rat tissue culture cells are packaged with nonacetylated histones (7Mutskov V.J.

Xenopus laevis produces two major types of 5 S rRNA: the somatic type, which is transcribed in most cells, and the oocyte type, which is produced only during early oogenesis, early embryogenesis, and in certain tissue culture cell lines (8Ford P.J. Mathieson T. Nature. 1976; 261: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 9Wormington W.M. Brown D.D. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Each 5 S rRNA type is transcribed from a distinct multigene family, and considerable research has focused on explaining the differential expression of these genes in somatic cells. Recently, it has been reported that histone acetylation enhances RNA polymerase III transcription of dinucleosomal 5 S rRNA gene templates (10Ura K. Kurumizaka H. Dimitrov S. Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2096-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for histone acetylation in 5 S rRNA transcription. It was also demonstrated that in a X. laevis kidney cell line transcribing low levels of oocyte 5 S rRNA, a small portion of oocyte genes were packaged with hyperacetylated histones (11Reynolds W.F. Smith R.D. Bloomer L.S. Gottesfeld J.M. Cell Nucleus. 1982; 11: 63-87Google Scholar). Although this seemingly indicates a correlation between histone acetylation and 5 S rRNA transcription, it is not know whether the active oocyte genes are the subset packaged with acetylated histones in this cell line. In this study we sought to examine the relationship between histone acetylation and transcription of the X. laevis oocyte and somatic 5 S rRNA genes by determining whether these gene repeats are packaged with hyperacetylated histone H4 in somatic cells in which the genes are differentially regulated. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThis study examined the relationship between histone acetylation and transcription of the oocyte and somatic 5 S rRNA genes in X. laevis by determining whether these genes are packaged with hyperacetylated histone H4 in somatic cells in which the genes are differentially expressed. Previously it has been reported that certainXenopus tissue culture cell lines express low levels of oocyte 5 S rRNA (8Ford P.J. Mathieson T. Nature. 1976; 261: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and thus it was necessary to determine whether the oocyte genes were truly repressed in the somatic cell line used in this investigation. To this end, total cellular RNA was isolated from tissue culture cells, resolved by partially denaturing PAGE, blotted, and probed with a sequence specific for the oocyte 5 S rRNA gene. Because of a six-nucleotide difference between the oocyte and somatic 5 S rRNAs, the two molecules migrate differently in this partially denaturing gel system. This can be seen by comparing lanes 1and 2 in Fig. 1, which show that the T7 polymerase transcribed somatic 5 S rRNA migrated faster than its oocyte counterpart. Lane 3 of Fig. 1 shows the results of Northern blot analysis of the total cellular RNA from theXenopus tissue culture cell line. The results show only one band, the migration of which closely resembled that of the somatic 5 S rRNA (Fig. 1, lane 1). No oocyte-like transcripts were observed.

It must be noted that the T7 transcribed somatic 5 S rRNA migrated slightly slower than that isolated from the tissue culture cells.

When the antibody was omitted from the immunoprecipitation (−Ab) or replaced with nonspecific polysera (PS), very little signal was seen in the bound fraction when probing with totalXenopus DNA, indicating that immunoprecipitation was not because of nonspecific precipitation of nucleosomes. Because equal amounts of both the bound and unbound fractions were blotted, if the oocyte or somatic 5 S rRNA genes were packaged with acetylated histone H4, there would be an enrichment for these sequences in the immunoprecipitate, and a more intense signal for the bound fraction than that for the unbound. The results show that in the case of the somatic genes, there was an ∼5-fold enrichment for this sequence in the bound fraction, suggesting that the upstream nontranscribed sequence is packaged with hyperacetylated histones. In the case of the oocyte genes, although there was some signal, there was not an enrichment for the oocyte 5 S rRNA genes in the bound fraction. The fact that the signal for the bound is less intense than that of the unbound suggests that the upstream, nontranscribed sequence of the oocyte genes were selectively not precipitated, indicating that this region of the oocyte 5 S rRNA genes was not packaged with hyperacetylated histone H4. Assuming that the acetylation state of the spacer nucleosomes reflects that of any nucleosomes on the 5 S rRNA coding sequence, these results indicate that the transcriptionally active somatic 5 S rRNA genes are packaged with acetylated histones, whereas the transcriptionally silent oocyte genes in X. laevis are not. It should be noted that because the 5 S rRNA transcription complex spans a region greater than the 120 bp 5 S rRNA coding region (21Wolffe A.P. Morse R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4592-4599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Peck L.J. Bartilson M. DeRisi J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 11: 443-449Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), it would be unexpected for this complex to form without displacing any nucleosomes located on this sequence. This is supported by DNase I footprint analysis of 5 S rRNA genes containing transcription complexes in vivo (23Engelke D.R. Gottesfeld J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Chipev C.C. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that the transcriptionally active somatic 5 S rRNA genes used for this study have nucleosomes on the actual coding sequence. Because the above results demonstrate that the transcriptionally silent oocyte 5 S rRNA genes were not packaged with hyperacetylated histone H4, this would seemingly suggest the presence of nonacetylated histones on these genes. To verify the presence of nucleosomes on these genes, tissue culture cell chromatin was digested with micrococcal nuclease and Southern blotted. If the upstream, nontranscribed sequence of the oocyte gene had a low abundance of nucleosomes, this region of DNA would be sensitive to micrococcal nuclease digestion. Fig.4 shows that this is not the case because digestion of the oocyte gene with micrococcal nuclease resulted in micrococcal nuclease-resistant fragments characteristic of the presence of nucleosomes on these genes, which has been shown by others (11Reynolds W.F. Smith R.D. Bloomer L.S. Gottesfeld J.M. Cell Nucleus. 1982; 11: 63-87Google Scholar, 23Engelke D.R. Gottesfeld J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,24Chipev C.C. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results also show that the oocyte genes in this cell line were less sensitive to micrococcal digestion than the bulk of the chromatin because more time was required to produce the same extent of digestion (compare the third and fourth lanes of the ethidium bromide-stained gel in Fig. 4 A with those of the Southern blot in Fig. 4 B). Previous studies suggest that histone acetylation is one of the hallmarks of poised or potentially active genes (5Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Clayton A.L. Crane-Robinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Clayton A.L. Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Another well defined property of these regions is a general sensitivity to nucleases such as DNase I, DNase II, and micrococcal nuclease. In X. laevis somatic cells, the transcriptionally silent oocyte 5 S rRNA genes cannot be considered transcriptionally poised using these classifications because they are packaged with hypoacetylated histones and are less sensitive to micrococcal nuclease digestion than bulk chromatin. These results, taken together with those of others demonstrating the presence of acetylated histones on oocyte genes in cells in which oocyte 5 S rRNA is synthesized at low levels (11Reynolds W.F. Smith R.D. Bloomer L.S. Gottesfeld J.M. Cell Nucleus. 1982; 11: 63-87Google Scholar), suggest a link between histone acetylation and 5 S rRNA transcription. This is further supported by the fact that the transcriptionally active somatic 5 S rRNA genes are packaged with hyperacetylated histone H4. The repression of oocyte 5 S rRNA transcription in somatic cells is reportedly because of the presence of histone H1 and reduced levels of transcription factor IIIA (25Schlissel M.S. Brown D.D. Cell. 1984; 37: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26Wolffe A.P. Brown D.D. Science. 1988; 241: 1626-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 27Bouvet P. Dimitrov S. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1147-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The lack of histone acetylation in transcriptionally silent oocyte 5 S rRNA chromatin could then be explained by a blockage of a histone acetyltransferase activity by histone H1 or a requirement for the RNA polymerase III transcriptional machinery for the recruitment of this activity. We are very grateful to Dr. Joel Gottesfeld for valuable suggestions, Dr. Paul Labhart for the generous gift of theX. laevis K2 cell line, Dr. Paul Romaniuk and Dr. Don Brown for the plasmids used in this work, and Jason Bell for technical advice."
https://openalex.org/W1993084457,"The E8 open reading frame of Bovine papillomavirus type 4 (BPV-4) encodes a small (42 amino acid) hydrophobic polypeptide localized to cellular membranes and capable of conferring an anchorage-independent (AI) growth phenotype on primary bovine cells co-transfected with BPV-4 E7 ORF and an activated ras gene. To further study the function of E8 independently of other viral gene products, we have expressed it in the murine fibroblast cell line, NIH3T3. Cells expressing E8 are capable of AI growth and escape growth arrest after serum withdrawal. E8 deregulates cyclin A expression, induces transactivation of the human cyclin A gene promoter and increases endogenous protein levels in cells maintained in short-term suspension culture and in low-serum (LS). Both these culture conditions promote downregulation of cyclin A in control cells. In LS growth conditions E8 permits sustained cyclin A-associated kinase activity but not cyclin E-cdk2 activity. Cyclin A-cdk2 activity and, in part, cyclin A gene expression are regulated by the cdk inhibitor p27Kip1. Expression of this cdk inhibitor is also de-regulated in E8 cells, with high levels being detected under all culture conditions tested. These data suggest that the ability of BPV-4 E8 to transform NIH3T3 cells is associated with upregulation of cyclin A-associated kinase activity and de-regulated expression of the cdk inhibitor p27Kip1 and does not rely on down-regulation of p27Kip1 expression. Analysis of E8 mutants indicate that the hydrophilic 'tail' of the molecule (residues 31-42) is required for cell transformation, as assessed by anchorage-independent growth, while a form of E8 with expression restricted to the Endoplasmic Reticulum/cis-Golgi membranes by addition of a 'KDEL' retention signal revealed that the sub-cellular localization is an important determinant of E8 biological activity."

https://openalex.org/W2322884534,"Transforming growth factors-beta (TGF-βs) play pivotal roles in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, although little is known regarding the regulation of cytoplasmic components by TGF-βs. Src tyrosine kinase is required for signal transduction of various cytokine receptors, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and G-protein coupled receptors. Moreover, Src tyrosine kinase is important in signal cross-talk between these receptors. To determine whether Src kinase is also involved in TGF-β signaling, we examined the effects of TGF-β1 on Src in the rat fibroblast cell line 3Y1 and in v-Src-transformed 3Y1 (SR-3Y1). TGF-β1 inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and inhibited growth in SR-3Y1 cells, while it did not affect the growth of 3Y1 cells. TGF-β1 significantly decreased v-Src kinase activity and protein abundance in SR-3Y1 cells, mainly by accelerating the degradation of v-Src. In contrast, in 3Y1 cells, TGF-β1 did not affect c-Src abundance or kinase activity. However, upon activation of c-Src in 3Y1 cells by PDGF, TGF-β1 decreased Src abundance. Additionally, in 3Y1 cells transfected with an activated c-Src mutant which lacks the SH3 domain, its level was decreased by TGF-β1 treatment. These findings suggest that TGF-β1 specifically induces degradation of activated Src kinase. This may be a novel mechanism for cross-talk between growth factors and TGF-β."
