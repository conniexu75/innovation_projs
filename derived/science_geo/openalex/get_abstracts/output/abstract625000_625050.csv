https://openalex.org/W2906819009,"Background Previous evidence suggests that mindfulness training may improve aspects of psychosocial well-being. Whilst mindfulness is traditionally taught in person, consumers are increasingly turning to mindfulness-based smartphone apps as an alternative delivery medium for training. Despite this growing trend, few studies have explored whether mindfulness delivered via a smartphone app can enhance psychosocial well-being within the general public. Methods The present pilot randomised controlled trial compared the impact of engaging with the self-guided mindfulness meditation (MM) app ‘Headspace’ (n = 38) for a period of 10 or 30 days, to a wait-list (WL) control (n = 36), using a cohort of adults from the general population. The Satisfaction with Life Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Wagnild Resilience Scale were administered online at baseline and after 10 and 30 days of the intervention. Results Twelve participants (MM n = 9, WL n = 3) were lost to follow-up for unknown reasons. Relative to the WL control, the MM app positively impacted self-reported satisfaction with life, stress, and resilience at day 10, with further improvements emerging at day 30 (Cohen’s d = 0.57, 1.42, 0.63 respectively). The rate of improvement was largest at the 10-day assessment point, dropping moderately by day 30. Participants that rated the MM app as easy to engage with experienced the largest self-reported benefits. Moreover, the MM app was able to protect against an unexpected increase in perceived stress that emerged in the control group. Conclusions This pilot randomised controlled trial shows that self-reported improvements in psychosocial outcomes can be achieved at low cost through short-term engagement with a mindfulness-based smartphone app, and should be followed up with more substantive studies.

https://openalex.org/W2908464782,"Background Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are used in numerous consumer products. They are persistent, bioaccumulating, and suspected to be endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). A growing body of research has reported the association between PFAS exposure and adverse health effects. Concerns have been raised with special focus in childhood development. Methods Perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA), perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were analyzed by LC/MS/MS in serum from 1,616 pregnant women in the Swedish SELMA study. The serum samples were collected in the first trimester (median week 10). Least square geometric means (LSGM) of PFAS were estimated for each year period for, adjusted for potential determinants including parity, fish intake in the family, and mother's age. Results Six PFAS (PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFHxS, PFOA, and PFOS) were detected above levels of detection (LOD) in more than 99% of the SELMA women, while PFHpA, and PFDoDA were detected above LOD in 73.4% and 46.7% respectively. Parity, maternal age, maternal smoking, and fish intake during pregnancy were found to be significantly associated (p<0.05) with serum PFAS levels in the pregnant women. Finally, serum concentration of six PFAS (PFNA, PFDA, PFHxS, PFHpA, PFOA and PFOS) were significantly decreasing (range 14–31%) during the period of 30 months from 2007–2010. Conclusions Our analysis shows that six out of eight PFAS could be identified in serum of more than 99% of SELMA subjects with a significant slightly decreasing trend for five of these compounds. Furthermore, parity, higher fish intake and mothers age are determinants for serum levels of PFAS in pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W2906725237,"Rhizophagus irregularis, an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, a bacterium, are microorganisms that promote plant growth. They associate with plant roots and facilitate nutrient absorption by their hosts, increase resistance against pathogens and pests, and regulate plant growth through phytohormones. In this study, eight local plant species in Finland (Antennaria dioica, Campanula rotundifolia, Fragaria vesca, Geranium sanguineum, Lotus corniculatus, Thymus serpyllum, Trifolium repens, and Viola tricolor) were inoculated with R. irregularis and/or B. amyloliquefaciens in autoclaved substrates to evaluate the plant growth-promoting effects of different plant/microbe combinations under controlled conditions. The eight plant species were inoculated with R. irregularis, B. amyloliquefaciens, or both microbes or were not inoculated as a control. The impact of the microbes on the plants was evaluated by measuring dry shoot weight, colonization rate by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, bacterial population density, and chlorophyll fluorescence using a plant phenotyping facility. Under dual inoculation conditions, B. amyloliquefaciens acted as a ""mycorrhiza helper bacterium"" to facilitate arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus colonization in all tested plants. In contrast, R. irregularis did not demonstrate reciprocal facilitation of the population density of B. amyloliquefaciens. Dual inoculation with B. amyloliquefaciens and R. irregularis resulted in the greatest increase in shoot weight and photosynthetic efficiency in T. repens and F. vesca."
https://openalex.org/W2906837414,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Nintedanib, a multi-kinase inhibitor that targets several tyrosine kinases, including PDGF receptor (PDGFR), was recently approved as an anti-fibrotic agent to reduce the deterioration of FVC in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the effects of PDGFR-α or -β on pulmonary fibrosis remain unclear. In an attempt to clarify their effects, we herein used blocking antibodies specific for PDGFR-α (APA5) and -β (APB5) in a bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model. The effects of these treatments on the growth of lung fibroblasts were examined using the 3H-thymidine incorporation assay in vitro. The anti-fibrotic effects of these antibodies were investigated with the Ashcroft score and collagen content of lungs treated with BLM. Their effects on inflammatory cells in the lungs were also analyzed using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. We investigated damage to epithelial cells and the proliferation of fibroblasts in the lungs. APA5 and APB5 inhibited the phosphorylation of PDGFR-α and -β as well as the proliferation of lung fibroblasts induced by PDGF-AA and BB. The administration of APB5, but not APA5 effectively inhibited BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Apoptosis and the proliferation of epithelial cells and fibroblasts were significantly decreased by the treatment with APB5, but not by APA5. The late treatment with APB5 also ameliorated fibrosis in lungs treated with BLM. These results suggest that PDGFR-α and -β exert different effects on BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. A specific approach using the blocking antibody for PDGFR-β may be useful for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2907891681,"Thousand grain weight is one of the components determining wheat grain yield. It represents the average value of individual grain weights which depends on position within the ear and on positon within the spikelet. Our objective was to quantify the influences of individual floret anthesis date, of carpel weight at anthesis and of rate and duration of grain filling, on variation in individual final grain weight. Two bread wheat cultivars were grown in a greenhouse and their ears were sampled from anthesis through to harvest. Each ear was divided into three parts-basal, central and apical-where the two proximal grains were dissected from each of two spikelets. We analysed (i) the flowering time shift within the ear and within the spikelet; and (ii) the growth kinetics during grain filling in relation to position along the ear. For both cultivars, florets located in the central part of the ear were the first to reach anthesis followed by those in the apical part and then the basal part. Within a spikelet, the floret located nearest the rachis flowered first followed by the more distal ones. We found no significant systematic effect of flowering time-shift on final grain weight. Nevertheless, grains in the central part were heavier than the basal ones (9.75% smaller) and than the apical ones (18.25% smaller). These differences were explained mainly by differences in mean grain filling rates. Analysis of growth kinetics enabled an improved explanation of the variability of individual grain weight along the ear."
https://openalex.org/W2906921089,"Purpose To analyze the associations of retinal and choroidal thickness on enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) with clinical, ophthalmic and genetic factors in the normal elderly population (aged 65 years or older). Methods In this prospective, population-based cohort study, people aged 65 years or older were enrolled in the baseline study of the Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging (KLoSHA) Eye Study. All participants underwent spectral domain-OCT scan using the EDI technique. A topographic map of the retina was obtained and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) was measured manually. Blood samples from all subjects were genotyped for major age-related macular degeneration (AMD)-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) the major AMD-associated SNPs; CFH Y402H rs1061170, CFH I62V rs800292, ARMS2 A69S rs10490924. A statistical analysis was conducted to compare the retinal thickness, choroidal thickness, and AMD risk genotypes. Results Among the three hundred eighty people enrolled, the mean age was 76.6 years (range 65–99 years). Factors that showed correlation with either tomographic retinal parameters, retinal nerve fiber layer, or SFCT, were age and gender. Significant age-related decrease in thickness was observed in the RNFL, mean central thickness (MCT) and SFCT. Gender differences existed in central foveolar thickness (CFT) and MCT, where it was thicker in men. While chorioretinal parameters were not related with other genotypes, CFH rs1061170 risk genotype was significantly associated with thin SFCT. The group containing the AMD- risk allele (CT) had a 14.7% reduction in the SFCT compared to the non-risk TT group. Conclusions In addition to the well-known association with AMD, CFH rs1061170 is a significant genetic risk factor associated with choroidal thinning in normal eyes of the elderly population. Such findings may provide further insight into the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration as well as normal aging. In addition, our study provides the first normative data on retinal and choroidal thickness in population-based aged groups with a mean age over seventy-five."
https://openalex.org/W2907038346,"Promoting physical activities is important for medical and functional recovery after stroke. Therefore, an accurate and convenient measurement of physical activities is necessary to provide feedback on functional status and effects of rehabilitative interventions. We assessed the feasibility, reliability, and validity of wearing accelerometers to monitor physical activities of stroke patients by estimating energy expenditure. This was a prospective observational quantitative study conducted in an inpatient rehabilitation unit. Twenty-four patients with subacute stroke were enrolled. They wore accelerometers on wrists and ankles for three consecutive weekdays. The feasibility was evaluated by daily wear-time. The test-retest reliability was determined by intra-class correlation coefficient. The validity was evaluated by comparing accelerometeric data to behavior mappings using Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman's rho correlation coefficient (r) and Bland-Altman plots. Average wearing time for four accelerometers was 20.99 ± 3.28 hours per day. The 3-day accelerometer recording showed excellent test-retest reliability. For sedentary activities, wrist accelerometers showed higher correlation with direct observation than ankle accelerometers. For light to moderate activities, ankle accelerometers showed higher correlation with direct observation than wrist accelerometers. Overall, combined models of accelerometers showed higher correlation with direct observation than separate ones. Wearing accelerometers for 24 h may be useful for measuring physical activities in subjects with subacute stroke in an inpatient rehabilitation unit."
https://openalex.org/W2907408516,"Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are pathological voltage oscillations during the repolarization phase of cardiac action potentials. They are considered as potential precursors to cardiac arrhythmias and have recently gained much attention in the context of preclinical drug safety testing under the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) paradigm. From the viewpoint of multiple time scales theory, the onset of EADs has previously been studied by means of mathematical action potential models with one slow ion channel gating variable. In this article, we for the first time associate EADs with mixed mode oscillations in dynamical systems with two slow gating variables and present a folded node singularity of the slow flow as a novel mechanism for EADs genesis. We derive regions of the pharmacology parameter space in which EADs occur using both the folded node analysis and a full system bifurcation analysis, and we suggest the normal distance to the boundary of the EADs region as a mechanism-based risk metric to computationally estimate a drug’s proarrhythmic liability."
https://openalex.org/W2949877177,"The velvet belly lanternshark (Etmopterus spinax) is a small deep-sea shark commonly found in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. This bioluminescent species is able to emit a blue-green ventral glow used in counter-illumination camouflage, mainly. In this study, paired-end Illumina HiSeqTM technology has been employed to generate transcriptome data from eye and ventral skin tissues of the lanternshark. About 64 and 49 million Illumina reads were generated from skin and eye tissues respectively. The assembly allowed us to predict 119,749 total unigenes including 94,569 for the skin transcriptome and 94,365 for the eye transcriptome while 74,753 were commonly found in both transcriptomes. A taxonomy filtering was applied to extract a reference transcriptome containing 104,390 unigenes among which 38,836 showed significant similarities to known sequences in NCBI non-redundant protein sequences database. Around 58% of the annotated unigenes match with predicted genes from the Elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii) genome. The transcriptome completeness has been evaluated by successfully capturing around 98% of orthologous genes of the « Core eukaryotic gene dataset » within the E. spinax reference transcriptome. We identified potential ""light-interacting toolkit"" genes including multiple genes related to ocular and extraocular light perception processes such as opsins, phototransduction actors or crystallins. Comparative gene expression analysis reveals eye-specific expression of opsins, ciliary phototransduction actors, crystallins and vertebrate retinoid pathway actors. In particular, mRNAs from a single rhodopsin gene and its potentially associated peropsin were detected in the eye transcriptome, only, confirming a monochromatic vision of the lanternshark. Encephalopsin mRNAs were mainly detected in the ventral skin transcriptome. In parallel, immunolocalization of the encephalopsin within the ventral skin of the shark suggests a functional relation with the photophores, i.e. epidermal light-producing organs. We hypothesize that extraocular photoreception might be involved in the bioluminescence control possibly acting on the shutter opening and/or the photocyte activity itself. The newly generated reference transcriptome provides a valuable resource for further understanding of the shark biology."
https://openalex.org/W2907672747,"Background and objectives Fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm) has multiple adverse effects on human health, especially on the respiratory and circulatory system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term effect of PM2.5 on the mortality risk of non-accidental and circulatory diseases, and to explore the potential effect modification by sex, education and death location. Methods We collected daily mortality counts of Changchun (China) residents, daily meteorology and air pollution data, from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2017. We focused on the elderly (≥65 years old) population who died from non-accidental causes and circulatory diseases, and stratified them by sex, education, and death location. A generalized additive Poisson regression model (GAM) was used to analyse the impact of air pollutants on mortality. We fit single pollutant models to examine PM2.5 effects with different lag structures of single-day (distributed lag:lag0-lag3) and multi-day (moving average lag: lag01-lag03). To test the sensitivity of the model, a multi-pollutant model was established when the PM2.5 effect was strongest. Results In the single pollutant models, an increment of PM2.5 by 10 μg/m3 at lag0-3 was associated with a 0.385% (95% CI: 0.069% to 0.702%) increase in daily non-accidental mortality and a 0.442% (95% CI: 0.038% to 0.848%) increase in daily circulatory disease mortality. NO2 (lag1) and O3 (lag0, lag1, lag2, lag01,lag02, lag03) were associated with daily non-accidental death and NO2 (lag1, lag3, lag03) and O3 (lag0, lag1, lag01,lag02, lag03) were associated with daily circulatory disease mortality. In the co-pollutant models, the risk estimates for PM2.5 changed slightly. The excess mortality risk of non-accidental and circulatory diseases was higher for women, people with low education, and died outside hospital. Conclusions We found that short-term exposure to PM2.5 increased the mortality risk of non-accidental and circulatory diseases among the elderly in Changchun. Women, people with low education and died outside hospital are more susceptible to PM2.5. NO2 and O3 were also associated with an increase in mortality from non-accidental and circulatory diseases and the O3 is a high effect."
https://openalex.org/W2907109127,"Behaviors characterized as restricted and repetitive (RRBs) in autism manifest in diverse ways, from motor mannerisms to intense interests, and are diagnostically defined as interfering with functioning. A variety of early autism interventions target RRBs as preoccupying young autistic children to the detriment of exploration and learning opportunities. In an exploratory study, we developed a novel stimulating play situation including objects of potential interest to autistic children, then investigated repetitive behaviors and object explorations in 49 autistic and 43 age-matched typical young children (20-69 months). Autistic children displayed significantly increased overall frequency and duration of repetitive behaviors, as well as increased specific repetitive behaviors. However, groups did not significantly differ in frequency and duration of overall object explorations, in number of different objects explored, or in explorations of specific objects. Exploratory analyses found similar or greater exploration of literacy-related objects in autistic compared to typical children. Correlations between repetitive behaviors and object explorations (their frequency and duration) revealed positive, not negative, associations in both groups. Our findings, from a novel situation incorporating potential autistic interests, suggest that RRBs do not necessarily displace exploration and its possibilities for learning in autism."
https://openalex.org/W2907275069,"In Milgram's seminal obedience studies, participants' behaviour has traditionally been explained as a demonstration of people's tendency to enter into an 'agentic state' when in the presence of an authority figure: they attend only to the demands of that authority and are insensitive to the plight of their victims. There have been many criticisms of this view, but most rely on either indirect or anecdotal evidence. In this study, participants (n = 40) are taken through a Virtual Reality simulation of the Milgram paradigm. Compared to control participants (n = 20) who are not taken through the simulation, those in the experimental conditions are found to attempt to help the Learner more by putting greater emphasis on the correct word over the incorrect words. We also manipulate the extent to which participants identify with the science of the study and show that high identifiers both give more help, are less stressed, and are more hesitant to press the shock button than low identifiers. We conclude that these findings constitute a refutation of the 'agentic state' approach to obedience. Instead, we discuss implications for the alternative approaches such as 'engaged followership' which suggests that obedience is a function of relative identification with the science and with the victim in the study. Finally, we discuss the value of Virtual Reality as a technique for investigating hard-to-study psychological phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2906925371,"Objective Maternity waiting homes (MWHs) have been identified as one solution to decrease maternal morbidity and mortality by bringing women living in hard-to-reach areas closer to a hospital or health center that provides emergency obstetric care. The objective of this study was to obtain data on current MWH characteristics and the women who use them as well as women’s perceptions and experiences with MWHs among seven Saving Mothers Giving Life (SMGL) supported districts in Zambia. Methods A cross-sectional household survey design was used to collect data from 2381 mothers who delivered a child in the past 13 months from catchment areas associated with 40 health care facilities in seven districts. Multi-stage random sampling procedures were employed with probability proportionate to population size randomly selected. Logistic regression models, Chi-square, and independent t-tests were used to analyze the data. Results Women who lived 15–24 km from a health care facility were more likely to use a MWH when compared to women who lived 9.5–9.9 km from the nearest facility (AOR: 1.722, 95% CI: 1.450, 2.045) as were women who lived 25 km or more (AOR: 2.098, 95% CI: 1.176, 3.722.881). Women who were not married had lower odds of utilizing a MWH when compared to married women (AOR: 0.590, 95% CI: 0.369, 0.941). Over half of mothers using a MWH prior to delivery reported problems at the MWH related to boredom (42.4%), management oversight (33.3%), safety (33.4%), and quality (43.7%). While the study employs a robust design, it is limited by its focus in Saving Mothers Giving Life districts. Conclusion MWHs, which currently take many forms in Zambia, are being used by over a third of women delivering at a health facility in our study. Although over half of women using the existing MWHs noted crowdedness and nearly a third reported problems with the physical quality of the building as well as with their interaction with staff, these MWHs appear to be bridging the distance barrier for women who live greater than 9.5 km from a health care facility."
https://openalex.org/W2907420903,"Ambient noise can affect the availability of acoustic information to animals, altering both foraging and vigilance behaviour. Using captive zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, we examined the effect of ambient broadband noise on foraging decisions. Birds were given a choice between foraging in a quiet area where conspecific calls could be heard or a noisy area where these calls would be masked. Birds foraging in noisy areas spent a significantly more time vigilant than those in quiet areas, resulting in less efficient foraging. Despite this there was no significant difference in the amount of time spent in the two noise regimes. However there did appear a preference for initially choosing quiet patches during individuals' second trial. These results emphasise how masking noise can influence the foraging and anti-predation behaviour of animals, which is particularly relevant as anthropogenic noise becomes increasingly prevalent in the natural world."
https://openalex.org/W4240363044,"Introduction The WHO urges action against the threat posed by HIV drug resistance. It is well known that the sensitivity of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is greater than that of Sanger Sequencing (SS). The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the novel NGS HIV-1 drug resistance monitoring system. Materials & methods NGS analyses were performed on 67 plasma samples from HIV-1 infected patients using the Sentosa SQ HIV Genotyping Assay from Vela-Dx. This kit was used on a semi-automated Ion Torrent-based platform. Sequences were compared to those obtained by SS. Samples were analysed in the same and in separate runs. Quality controls (QC) were added to control sequencing processes of protease (PRO), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (INT) regions. Results Of the 41 analysed samples, 33 (80.5%) had identical drug resistance interpretation reports. Discrepant results were observed for eight samples. Five of them were only detected by NGS and had drug resistance mutations (DRMs) with an allelic frequency below the limit of detection of the SS method (between 6.3 to 20.5%). Two DRMs were only identified using the SS method. The sequences were similar in 98.2% of cases (counting variants as mismatches) and homologous in 99.9% if missed variants. Duplicated samples in a single run were similar in 95.7% (99.9%) of cases. Duplicated samples in two different runs were 98% (100%) homologous. QC results were manually assessed with a score of 340/340 for detection of DRMs in PRO and RT and 100% for INT sequencing. Conclusions This is the first preliminary evaluation in Belgium employing the Sentosa SQ HIV Genotyping Assay. The NGS appears to be a promising tool for the detection of DRMs in HIV-1 patients and showed a higher sensitivity compared to SS. Large studies assessing the clinical relevance of low frequency DRMs are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2906687701,"Background and purpose Vocal fold leukoplakia, white plaque on the epithelium, has the potential for malignant transformation regardless of dysplasia grade. It is treated with different laser types (CO2 or angiolytic) and various techniques (vaporization, stripping, or excision); however, only a few studies exist regarding comparative laser surgery results. This study was conducted to investigate clinical outcomes of CO2 versus angiolytic laser microdissection with regard to long-term disease control and voice preservation in vocal fold leukoplakia. Materials and methods Seventy patients with vocal fold leukoplakia treated by CO2 or angiolytic laser (pulsed dye laser or potassium titanyl phosphate) were identified retrospectively. Data regarding patient characteristics, treatment details, treatment outcomes including disease control (recurrence and progression) and the Voice Handicap Index, GRBAS scale, and acoustics were evaluated. The mean follow-up duration after initial treatment was 32 ± 26 months. Results The study group comprised 14 patients who underwent CO2 laser microflap excision and 56 who underwent angiolytic laser stripping. Of the patients treated with CO2 laser, 11 (79%) had no recurrence and three (21%) showed recurrent leukoplakia, of which one patient (7%) showed histologic grade progression. Of patients who underwent angiolytic laser stripping, 12 had disease recurrence (21%), among whom three (5%) showed disease progression. Laser surgery type, disease extent, and histologic grade showed no significant differences in recurrence or progression rates. The postoperative Voice Handicap Index significantly improved (P = .03) and the G score significantly decreased (P < .001) in the angiolytic laser treatment group. In contrast, the Voice Handicap Index increased postoperatively in the CO2 laser group (P = .046). Conclusions The long-term recurrence or progression rates were not significantly different between angiolytic and CO2 laser treatment. The angiolytic laser stripping group showed better voice preservation compared with the CO2 laser group. Angiolytic laser stripping is suggested as an effective treatment option for vocal fold leukoplakia with comparable disease control and better voice preservation."
https://openalex.org/W2907221157,"The purpose of this study is to determine the correlation between use of antimicrobials, such as fluoroquinolone, cefoxitin, and cefotaxime, and Escherichia coli resistance using a nationwide database. Nationwide data on antimicrobial consumption for 12 years (2002 to 2013) were acquired from a database of subjects (n = 1,025,340) included in the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort. National antimicrobial resistance rates of E. coli were obtained from the Korean Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, which has been administered by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2002. Fluoroquinolone-resistance rates of E. coli isolated from general hospitals have continuously increased since 2002 and were correlated with nationwide fluoroquinolone use (r = 0.82, P = 0.0012) or ciprofloxacin use (r = 0.90, P<0.0001). Cefotaxime-resistance rates of E. coli isolated from general hospitals markedly increased since 2008 and were correlated with nationwide cefotaxime use (r = 0.94, P<0.0001) or third-generation cephalosporin use (r = 0.96, P<0.0001). Cefoxitin-resistance rates of E. coli isolated from general hospitals peaked in 2010 and significantly correlated with cephamycin use at a two-year interval (r = 0.64, P = 0.0256). In conclusion, consumption of antimicrobials such as fluoroquinolone, cefoxitin, and cefotaxime is well correlated with the resistance rates of E. coli to these agents. This study provides background data for national antimicrobial management policies to reduce antimicrobial resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2907378598,"Background The mortality from cryptococcal meningitis remains high, despite the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and amphotericin-based fungal regimens. The role of neutrophils in cryptococcosis is controversial. Our objective was to examine the association between blood neutrophil counts and outcomes in terms of mortality, the incidence of bacterial infections (including Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and hospitalization among HIV-infected patients presenting with cryptococcal meningitis. Methods We used data from participants from the Cryptococcal Optimal ART Timing (COAT) trial (2010–2012; Uganda and South Africa) and the Adjunctive Sertraline for Treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis (ASTRO-CM) trial (2013–2017; Uganda). We estimated 30-day mortality risk with Cox proportional hazards models by baseline neutrophil counts (a) on a continuous scale and (b) with indicators for both relatively high (> 3,500 cells/mm3) and low (≤ 1,000 cells/mm3) counts. Follow-up neutrophil counts from the COAT trial were used to examine the time-dependent association of neutrophil counts with 12-month mortality and rehospitalization. Results 801 participants had an absolute neutrophil value at meningitis diagnosis. The median baseline absolute neutrophil count was 2100 cells/mm3 (IQR, 1400 to 3300 cells/mm3). Baseline neutrophil count was positively associated with 30-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.09, 95%CI, 1.04–1.13, per 1000 cells/mm3 increase; p<0.001). Baseline absolute neutrophil counts ≤ 1000 cells/mm3 did not have increased risk of 30-day mortality compared to those with baseline neutrophils of 1001–3500 cells/mm3; however, baseline >3500 cells/mm3 had significantly increased risk, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.85(95%CI, 1.40–2.44; p<0.001). Among the COAT participants with follow-up neutrophil data, there was a strong association between time-updated neutrophil count and 12-month mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.16, 95% CI 1.09–1.24; p<0.001. Conclusion Higher blood neutrophil counts in HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis were associated with mortality. Neutrophils role requires further investigation as to whether this may be a mediator directly contributing to mortality or merely a marker of underlying pathologies that increase mortality risk."
https://openalex.org/W2907980155,"Pigments and phytotoxins are crucial for the survival and spread of plant pathogenic fungi. The genome of the tomato biotrophic fungal pathogen Cladosporium fulvum contains a predicted gene cluster (CfPKS1, CfPRF1, CfRDT1 and CfTSF1) that is syntenic with the characterized elsinochrome toxin gene cluster in the citrus pathogen Elsinoë fawcettii. However, a previous phylogenetic analysis suggested that CfPks1 might instead be involved in pigment production. Here, we report the characterization of the CfPKS1 gene cluster to resolve this ambiguity. Activation of the regulator CfTSF1 specifically induced the expression of CfPKS1 and CfRDT1, but not of CfPRF1. These co-regulated genes that define the CfPKS1 gene cluster are orthologous to genes involved in 1,3-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin biosynthesis in other fungi. Heterologous expression of CfPKS1 in Aspergillus oryzae yielded 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene, a typical precursor of DHN melanin. Δcfpks1 deletion mutants showed similar altered pigmentation to wild type treated with DHN melanin inhibitors. These mutants remained virulent on tomato, showing this gene cluster is not involved in pathogenicity. Altogether, our results showed that the CfPKS1 gene cluster is involved in the production of DHN melanin and suggests that elsinochrome production in E. fawcettii likely involves another gene cluster."
https://openalex.org/W2908068736,"To understand the molecular processes triggered during the different steps of somatic embryogenesis (SE) in oil palm, the expression of 19 genes associated to SE identified in proteomic and transcriptomic studies was investigated by qRT-PCR. To evaluate the differential expression of these genes, two interspecific hybrid genotypes (Elaeis oleifera x Elaeis guineensis) contrasting for the acquisition of embryogenic competence were used. Aclorophyllated leaves of both hybrids, one responsive (B351733) and the other non-responsive (B352933) to SE were submitted to callus induction and collected at different time points: 0 (before induction), 14, 30, 90 and 150 days of callus induction (doi). The results obtained showed that all evaluated genes were downregulated at 14 doi in the responsive genotype when compared to the non-responsive. It was also possible to observe that most of the genes changed their expression behavior at 30 doi and were upregulated thereafter until 150 doi, with the exception of the pathogenesis-related PRB1-3-like (PRB1-3) gene, which did not show differential expression at 30 doi and was downregulated at 90 and 150 doi when compared to the non-responsive hybrid. These results indicate that 30 doi is a turning point in gene expression, probably associated to embryogenic competence acquisition. We also show that the expression behavior of the responsive genotype is more stable than that of the non-responsive when the different induction time points are compared to 0 doi (before induction). Moreover, the results obtained in this study corroborate our hypothesis that the regulation of genes involved in the control of oxidative stress and energy metabolism are crucial for the acquisition of embryogenic competence in oil palm."
https://openalex.org/W2907200614,"Purpose Using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) the retina can be segmented automatically to visualize all retinal layers. In glaucoma chronically elevated intraocular pressure leads to a decline of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) which changes retinal architecture. The goal of these analyses was to gain insight into the changes induced by glaucoma within all macular layers using SD-OCT within a closely circumscribed glaucoma cohort. Materials and methods SD-OCT measurements with automated retinal layer segmentation were performed in both eyes of primary open-angle glaucoma patients with a defined monocular absolute visual field scotoma in the central 10° of the visual field and in an age-matched healthy control group. Thickness of single retinal layers and entire retina were compared with special attention to the localization of the visual field scotoma in the glaucomatous eyes. Results 30 eyes of 15 glaucoma patients and 15 eyes of 15 healthy controls were included in this study. Statistical significant thickness differences were detected in the control group between superior and inferior retina for the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), the outer plexiform layer (OPL) and the outer nuclear layer (ONL). In the glaucoma group thickness differences between worse and less affected eyes in the RNFL, the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the inner plexiform layers (INL) were found. Comparison between healthy and diseased eyes revealed significant thickness differences in the RNFL, GCL, IPL and total retinal thickness but not the outer retinal layers. Conclusion Comparison between SD-OCT measurements of the macula between healthy and glaucomatous eyes in a closely circumscribed disease stage showed a pronounced disease impact on the inner but not the outer retina. These results provide evidence that GCL and IPL thickness seem to be good measures to discriminate between affected and unaffected eyes in testing for glaucoma."

Methods A prospective, cohort study of women at 11–16 weeks gestation, ≥18 years of age, and carrying a singleton pregnancy was conducted from June 2016 to August 2017 after IRB approval. Women in the progesterone arm had a history of preterm birth and received weekly intramuscular 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate. Controls comprised of women with healthy, uncomplicated pregnancies. Excluded were women with vaginitis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or other chronic diseases affecting the immune response. A vaginal wash was performed at enrollment, at 26–28 weeks, and at 35–36 weeks gestation. Samples underwent semi-quantitative detection of human inflammatory markers. Immunofluorescence pixel density data was analyzed and a P value <0.05 was considered significant. Results There were 39 women included, 10 with a prior preterm birth and 29 controls. The baseline demographics and pregnancy outcomes for both groups were similar in age, parity, race, BMI, gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, and birth weight. Enrollment cytokines in women with a prior preterm birth, including IL-1 alpha (39.2±25.1% versus 26.1±13.2%; P = 0.04), IL-1 beta (47.9±26.4% versus 24.9±17%; P<0.01), IL-2 (16.7±9.3% versus 11.3±6.3%; P = 0.03), and IL-13 (16.9±12.4% versus 8.2±7.4%; P = 0.01) were significantly elevated compared to controls. In the third trimester the cytokine densities for IL-1 alpha (26.0±18.2% versus 22.3±12.0%; P = 0.49), IL-1 beta (31.8±15.9% versus 33.1±16.8%; P = 0.84), IL-2 (10.0±8.4% versus 10.9±5.9%; P = 0.71), and IL-13 (9.1±5.9% versus 10.0±6.5%; P = 0.71) were all statistically similar between the progesterone arm and controls, respectively. Conclusion There is an increased cytokine presence in vaginal washings of women at risk for preterm birth which appears to be modified following the administration of 17- hydroxyprogesterone caproate to levels similar to healthy controls."
https://openalex.org/W2907217626,"Plant-pollinator networks have been widely used to understand the ecology of mutualistic interactions between plants and animals. While a number of general patterns have been identified, the mechanisms underlying the structure of plant-pollinator networks are poorly understood. Here we present an agent based model (ABM) that simulates the movement of bees over heterogeneous landscapes and captures pollination events, enabling the influence of landscape pattern on pollination networks to be explored. Using the model, we conducted a series of experiments using virtual landscapes representing a gradient of forest loss and fragmentation. The ABM was able to produce expected trends in network structure, from simulations of interactions between individual plants and pollinators. For example, results indicated an increase in the index of complementary specialization (H2') and a decline in network connectance with increasing forest cover. Furthermore, network nestedness was not associated with the degree of forest cover, but was positively related to forest patch size, further supporting results obtained in the field. This illustrates the potential value of ABMs for exploring the structure and dynamics of plant-pollinator networks, and for understanding the mechanisms that underlie them. We attribute the results obtained primarily to a shift from specialist to generalist pollinators with increasing forest loss, a trend that has been observed in some field situations."
https://openalex.org/W2907655947,"The study aimed to assess the use of misoprostol and complications associated with abortions in referral hospitals in Nigeria, a country with restrictive abortion laws.A cross-sectional study at nine referral hospitals in South-west Nigeria. Nine years' data were retrieved from medical records, including 699 induced abortions. Independent variable was the method of abortion; dependent variables were complications, need for treatment and mortality. Statistical significance was tested with Chi-square, Fishers' exact and chi-square for trend tests (p<0.05).There were 699 induced abortions amongst 2,463 abortions found in records. Nearly 70% were surgical abortions, but misoprostol use significantly increased over the study period in a linear trend (Χ2 trend: 30.96, P <0.001). Patients who used misoprostol were significantly less likely to have infectious morbidity, genital tract injuries or medical complications. There was no difference in incomplete abortion in the groups. Patients were more likely to have in-patient care with surgical abortions (p<0.001), to need prolonged antibiotic regimens (p = 0.003), need further surgeries or additional specialist care (p = 0.009).Misoprostol abortion has significantly increased over time, and was associated with less morbidity and need for further treatment, in this study. It appears to be the safer option."
https://openalex.org/W2908255117,"The effects of the macrostructure of long chain fatty acids on the lipid metabolism and biosynthesis of lipid droplets (LD) was studied in mammary epithelial cells (MEC). MEC were exposed to similar compositions and concentrations of fatty acids in the form of either triglycerides (Tg), as part of the very-low-density lipids (VLDL) isolated from lactating cow plasma, or as non-esterified- free fatty acids (FFA). Exposing MEC to FFA resulted in two distinct processes; each independently could increase LD size: an elevation in Tg production and alterations in phospholipid (PL) composition. In particular, the lower PC/PE ratio in the FFA treatment indicated membrane destabilization, which was concomitant with the biosynthesis of larger LD. In addition, 6 fold increase in the cellular concentration of the exogenously added linoleic acid (C18:2) was found in MEC treated with FFA, implying that long chain fatty acids administrated as FFA have higher availability to MEC, enabling greater PL synthesis, more material for the LD envelope, thereby enhancing LD formation. Availability of long chain fatty acids administrated as VLDL-Tg, is dependent on LPL which its activity can be inhibited by the hydrolysis products. Therefore, we used increasing concentrations of albumin, to reduce the allosteric inhibition on LPL by the hydrolysis products. Indeed, a combined treatment of VLDL and albumin, increased LD size and number, similar to the phenotype found in the FFA treatment. These results reveal the role played by the macrostructure of long chain fatty acids in the regulation of LD size in MEC which determine the size of the secreted MFG."
https://openalex.org/W2908376293,"Social wasps are a major pest in many countries around the world. Pathogens may influence wasp populations and could provide an option for population management via biological control. We investigated the pathology of nests of apparently healthy common wasps, Vespula vulgaris, with nests apparently suffering disease. First, next-generation sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis were used to examine pathogen presence. The transcriptome of healthy and diseased V. vulgaris showed 27 known microbial phylotypes. Four of these were observed in diseased larvae alone (Aspergillus fumigatus, Moellerella wisconsensis, Moku virus, and the microsporidian Vavraia culicis). Kashmir Bee Virus (KBV) was found to be present in both healthy and diseased larvae. Moellerella wisconsensis is a human pathogen that was potentially misidentified in our wasps by the MEGAN analysis: it is more likely to be the related bacteria Hafnia alvei that is known to infect social insects. The closest identification to the putative pathogen identified as Vavraia culicis was likely to be another microsporidian Nosema vulgaris. PCR and subsequent Sanger sequencing using published or our own designed primers, confirmed the identity of Moellerella sp. (which may be Hafnia alvei), Aspergillus sp., KBV, Moku virus and Nosema. Secondly, we used an infection study by homogenising diseased wasp larvae and feeding them to entire nests of larvae in the laboratory. Three nests transinfected with diseased larvae all died within 19 days. No pathogen that we monitored, however, had a significantly higher prevalence in diseased than in healthy larvae. RT-qPCR analysis indicated that pathogen infections were significantly correlated, such as between KBV and Aspergillus sp. Social wasps clearly suffer from an array of pathogens, which may lead to the collapse of nests and larval death."
https://openalex.org/W2906984362,"Hendra virus (HeV) infection is endemic in Australian flying-fox populations. Habitat loss has increased the peri-urban presence of flying-foxes, increasing the risk of contact and therefore viral 'spillovers' into horse and human populations. An equine vaccine is available and horse-husbandry practices that minimize HeV exposure are encouraged, but their adoption is suboptimal. Ecological approaches-such as habitat creation and conservation-could complement vaccination and behavioural strategies by reducing spillover risks, but these are controversial.We convened three community juries (two regional; one metropolitan) to elicit the views of well-informed citizens on the acceptability of adding ecological approaches to current interventions for HeV risk. Thirty-one participants of diverse backgrounds, mixed genders and ages were recruited using random-digit-dialling. Each jury was presented with balanced factual evidence, given time to ask questions of expert presenters and, after deliberation, come to well-reasoned conclusions.All juries voted unanimously that ecological strategies should be included in HeV risk management strategies but concluded that current interventions-including vaccination and changing horse-husbandry practices-must remain the priority. The key reasons given for adopting ecological approaches were: (i) they address underlying drivers of disease emergence, (ii) the potential to prevent spillover of other bat-borne pathogens, and (iii) there would be broader community benefits. Juries differed regarding the best mechanism to create/conserve flying-fox habitat: participants in regional centres favoured direct government action, whereas the metropolitan jury preferred to place the burden on landholders.Informed citizens acknowledge the value of addressing the drivers of bat-borne infectious risks but differ substantially as to the best implementation strategies. Ecological approaches to securing bat habitat could find broad social support in Australia, but disagreement about how best to achieve them indicates the need for negotiation with affected communities to co-develop fair, effective and locally appropriate policies."
https://openalex.org/W2907750850,"Catalyzed by the concerns over the growing public health and economic burden of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Switzerland, a diverse group of experts and patient representatives came together in 2014 to develop the Swiss Hepatitis Strategy, setting targets for the elimination of viral hepatitis in Switzerland by 2030. Previous studies have reported the estimated number of chronic HCV infections and forecasted burden of disease given different intervention strategies. However, given new prevalence data by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, which decreased total infections by about half, an updated analysis is warranted. We aimed to provide an updated viremic prevalence estimate for Switzerland and evaluate the impact on forecasted liver related morbidity and mortality of an ‘inaction’ scenario and intervention scenarios to achieve the Global Health Sector Strategy for Viral Hepatitis and Swiss Hepatitis Strategy goals by 2030. A Markov disease-progression model was used to calculate the present and future burden of HCV infection by disease stage according to these different strategies. In 2017, there were an estimated 36,800 (95% UI: 26,900–39,200) viremic infections in Switzerland. Given the current standard of care, total viremic infections are expected to decline by 45%, while cases of decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related deaths will decrease by 20%. If treatment and diagnosis efforts were to cease in 2018, late stage HCV-related morbidity and mortality would increase by 90–100% by 2030. Increasing treatment and diagnosis to achieve the Global Health Sector Strategy or Swiss Hepatitis Strategy goals by 2030, will reduce the number of chronic infections to less than 13,000 and 4,000, respectively. Although the HCV epidemic is declining in Switzerland, efforts to expand diagnosis and treatment are needed to achieve elimination by 2030."

Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed a three-factor structure for the SOC-R ('manageability', 'balance', 'reflection') with acceptable indices (RMSEA .066; 90% CI [.062, .071]). Reliability analyses revealed good internal consistency (α = .87). Construct validity was supported by significant but low correlations with psychopathology. Gender marginally influenced SOC-R (t = 1.99, p = .05). Moderation analyses revealed that SOC-R exerted a protective impact on depression in the context of CTQ (t = 2.29, p < .05) and lifetime traumatic events (t = -2.37, p < .05).This study supports the psychometric properties of the SOC-R and emphasizes the importance of considering salutogenic effects to better understand interindividual differences in the effect of adversity."
https://openalex.org/W2907420691,"Although classified as an upper middle-income country, food insecurity is still a concern throughout South Africa, as was evident in 2014-2015 when a drought left 22% of households food insecure. Further, a range of domestic and international factors make the local currency unstable, leaving South Africa exposed to risk in global wheat and exchange rate markets and increasing its food insecurity vulnerability. As such, agricultural research in South Africa is needed specifically in plant breeding to increase yields and help mitigate future food insecurity. To foster scientific innovation for food security, the South African government funds the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), which conducts holistic research on wheat and other crops. This study estimates the proportions of increases in yield of ARC's wheat cultivars, which are attributable solely to genetic improvements. In total, 25,690 yield observations from 125 countrywide test plots from 1998 to 2014 were utilized to estimate the proportions of yield increases attributable to the ARC. We found that South African farmers who adopted the ARC's wheat varieties experienced an annual yield gain of 0.75%, 0.30%, and 0.093% in winter, facultative, and irrigated spring wheat types, respectively. Using observed area sown to ARC varieties, we estimated that wheat producers gained $106.45 million (2016 USD) during 1992-2015 via the adoption of ARC varieties. We estimated that every dollar invested in the ARC wheat breeding program generated a return of $5.10. Assuming the South African per capita wheat consumption is 60.9 kg/year, our results suggest that the ARC breeding program provided an average of 253,318 additional wheat rations from 1992-2015. Further, the net surplus (consumer plus producer) from the ARC breeding program was estimated at 42.64 million 2016 USD from 1992-2015. Public breeding programs, especially those focused on wheat and other staple foods, must continue if South Africa is to meet growing global food demand, decrease present global food insecurity, and maintain the genetic enhancements that directly enhances yield and benefits low-income consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2907488174,"Previous studies have suggested that exposure to ionizing radiation increases the risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD). The data from the Mayak nuclear worker cohort have indicated enhanced risk for IHD incidence. The goal of this study was to elucidate molecular mechanisms of radiation-induced IHD by integrating proteomics data with a transcriptomics study on post mortem cardiac left ventricle samples from Mayak workers categorized in four radiation dose groups (0 Gy, < 100 mGy, 100-500 mGy, > 500 mGy). The proteomics data that were newly analysed here, originated from a label-free analysis of cardiac samples. The transcriptomics analysis was performed on a subset of these samples. Stepwise linear regression analyses were used to correct the age-dependent changes in protein expression, enabling the separation of proteins, the expression of which was dependent only on the radiation dose, age or both of these factors. Importantly, the majority of the proteins showed only dose-dependent expression changes. Hierarchical clustering of the proteome and transcriptome profiles confirmed the separation of control and high-dose samples. Restrictive (separate p-values) and integrative (combined p-value) approaches were used to investigate the enrichment of biological pathways. The integrative method proved superior in the validation of the key biological pathways found in the proteomics analysis, namely PPAR signalling, TCA cycle and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. This study presents a novel, improved, and comprehensive statistical approach of analysing biological effects on a limited number of samples."
https://openalex.org/W2908106015,"Collapsing gully erosion is the main important and specific soil erosion type in the red soil region of tropical and subtropical South China. Knowledge of the soil disintegration characteristics within different weathering profiles (surface layer, red soil layer, sandy soil layer and detritus layer) and its relationships with soil particle size distribution and soil properties is important in understanding the mechanism of the forming process and development of the collapsing gully. In this paper, we conducted an experiment on four collapsing gullies located four counties (Tongcheng County, Gan County, Anxi County and Wuhua County) in the hilly granitic region of southern China. The anti-disintegration ability of the different weathering profiles with two different moisture conditions (the air-dried condition and the natural state condition) were determined by the anti-disintegration index (Kc) and measured by the submerging test. The results show that the coarse particles are higher in the sandy soil layer and the detritus layer of collapsing gully than that in the surface layer and the red soil layer, but the finer particles show the inversed order. The Kc values reduce significantly from the surface layer to the detritus layer. In the surface layer and the red soil layer, the Kc values in the natural state condition are much higher than that in the air-dried condition. The results highlight that, the sandy soil layer and the detritus layer are easily to disintegrate compare with the surface layer and the red soil layer, and in the case of low soil water content, the soil in any layer of collapsing gully is easy to disintegrate. The regression equation shows a very significant and positive relationship between the Kc values and the < 0.002 mm particles contents and the SOM (soil organic matter) (p<0.01), and negative relationship between the Kc values and the contents of other soil particle size. The results revealed that the repulsive force produced by compressed air in the soil exceeds the suction between the soil particles is the predominant factor to soil disintegrate rates in the air-dried state condition. Whereas the soil contained a certain amount of water can reduce the degree of disintegration. The results also indicated that the more contents of the cementation agents (like clay and SOM) in the soil of the different layers of collapsing gully, the higher Kc values (it means the more difficult to disintegrate)."
https://openalex.org/W2907793333,"The aim of this study was to use technical skill and physical performance and coaches’ rankings to predict the defensive performance of junior soccer players. Twenty-one male players (mean age 17.2 years, SD = 1.1) were recruited from the Londrina Junior Team Football Academy in Brazil. Data were collected during regular training sessions. After participants had warmed up, players were asked to either dribble the ball or sprint through five custom circuits that varied in average curvature (0–1.37 radians.m-1). In addition, four coaches were asked to rank the players from best to worst in defensive ability. Dribbling, sprinting, and coaches’ rankings were then compared with defending performance as assessed in the one vs. one competitions (N = 1090 paired-trials: 40–65 trials per individual), in which they acted as defender or attacker in turn. When defending, the objective was to steal the ball or prevent the attacker from running around them with the ball into a scoring zone. Testing occurred over three days. Overall, dribbling performance (r = 0.56; P = 0.008) and coaches’ ranking (r = 0.59; P = 0.004) were significantly related to defensive ability; sprinting performance was not (r = 0.20; P = 0.38). Though dribbling performance and coaches’ ranking each explained 30% and 37% of the variance in defensive performance, respectively, the two predictors were not related (r = 0.27; P = 0.23), so combined these traits explained more than half the variance in defensive performance. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that including only one metric of closed-skill performance—dribbling speed—doubles the ability of coaches to identify their best defensive players in one vs. one scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2906969054,"Repairing damaged articular cartilage is particularly challenging because of the limited ability of cartilage to perform self-repair. Intra-articular injections of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) comprise a method of repairing full-thickness articular cartilage defects in the rabbit knee joint model. To date, the effects of administration of GlcNAc and hyaluronic acid (HA) have been investigated only in the context of osteoarthritis treatment. Therefore, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of using cell-free porous poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) graft implants and intra-articular injections of GlcNAc or HA in a rabbit model of osteochondral regeneration to investigate whether they have the potential for inducing osteochondral regeneration when used alone or simultaneously. Twenty-four rabbits were randomized into one of four groups: the scaffold-only group (PLGA), the scaffold with intra-articular injections of GlcNAc (PLGA+G) group, twice per week for four weeks; the scaffold with intra-articular injections of HA group (PLGA+HA) group, once per week for three weeks; and the scaffold with intra-articular injections of GlcNAc and HA (PLGA+G+HA) group, once per week for three weeks. Knees were evaluated at 4 and 12 weeks after surgery. At the end of testing, only the PLGA+G+HA group exhibited significant bone reconstruction, chondrocyte clustering, and good interactions with adjacent surfaces at 4 weeks. Additionally, the PLGA+G+HA group demonstrated essentially original hyaline cartilage structures that appeared to have sound chondrocyte orientation, considerable glycosaminoglycan levels, and reconstruction of the bone structure at 12 weeks. Moreover, the PLGA+G+HA group showed organized osteochondral integration and significantly higher bone volume per tissue volume and trabecular thickness. However, there were no significant differences between the PLGA+G and PLGA+HA groups except for gap formation on subchondral bone in the PLGA+G group. This study demonstrated that PLGA implantation combined with intra-articular injections of GlcNAc and HA allowed for cartilage and bone regeneration and significantly promoted osteochondral regeneration in rabbits without supplementation of exogenous growth factors. And the combination of this two supplements with PLGA scaffold could also prolong injection interval and better performance than either of them alone for the reconstruction of osteochondral tissue in the knee joints of rabbits."
https://openalex.org/W2907182293,"Background Differential diagnosis of elevated high sensitive Troponin T (hsTnT) in acute ischemic stroke includes myocardial infarction (MI) and neurogenic stunned myocardium (NSM). The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with baseline hsTnT levels and MI or NSM in acute ischemic stroke. Methods We studied 204 consecutive patients of the prospective acquired Bern Stroke Database with acute ischemic stroke diagnosed by brain MR. All patient histories and cardiac examinations were reviewed retrospectively. Volumetry of lesions on diffusion and perfusion weighted brain imaging (circular singular value decomposition, Tmax >6sec) was performed. Voxel based analysis was performed to identify brain areas associated with hsTnT elevation. Linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of baseline hsTnT levels and myocardial infarction. Results Elevated hsTnT was observed in 58 of the 204 patients (28.4%). The mean age was 68.3 years in the normal hsTnT group and 69.7 years in the elevated hsTnT group. Creatinine (p<0.001, OR 6.735, 95% CI 58.734–107.423), baseline NIHSS score (p = 0.029, OR 2.207, 95% CI 0.675–12.096), ST segment depression (p = 0.025, OR 2.259, 95% CI 2.419–35.838), and negative T waves in baseline ECG (p = 0.002, OR 3.209, 95% CI 13.007–54.564) were associated with hsTnT elevation, while infarct location and size were not. Coronary angiography was performed in 30 of the 204 patients (14.7%) and myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 7 of them (23.3%). Predictive factors for myocardial infarction could not be identified. Conclusion Elevated baseline baseline hsTnT was associated with NIHSS, creatinine, ST segment depression and inverted T waves, but not with stroke location or size. None of the factors was helpful to differentiate MI and NSM. Therefore, ancillary investigations such as coronary angiography, cardiac MRI or both may be needed to solve the differential diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2908090698,"In ant communities, species coexist by using different foraging strategies. We developed an adaptive dynamics model to gain a better understanding of the factors that promote the emergence and maintenance of strategy diversity. We analysed the consequences of both interspecific competition and resource distribution for the evolutionary dynamics of social foraging in ants. The evolution of social foraging behaviour was represented using a stochastic mutation-selection process involving interactions among colonies. In our theoretical community, ant colonies inhabit an environment where resources are limited, and only one resource type is present. Colony interactions depend on colony-specific foraging strategies (defined as the degree of collective foraging), resource distribution patterns, and the degree of competition asymmetry. At the ecological timescale, we have created a model of foraging processes that reflects trade-offs between resource discovery and resource exploitation and between resource discovery and ant behavioural dominance. At the evolutionary timescale, we have identified the conditions of competition and resource distribution that can lead to the emergence and coexistence of both collective and individual foraging strategies. We suggest that asymmetric competition is an essential component in the emergence of diverse foraging strategies in a sympatric ant community."

Effective approaches to prevent and treat PTSD are important areas of basic science research. Pregabalin (PGB), a gabapentinoid derivative of γ-aminobutyric acid, possesses the potential to positively affect neurobehavioral changes associated with PTSD. Using a rodent model of PTSD, the aims of this study were to determine the effects of PGB as a possible prevention for the development of PTSD-like symptoms and its use as a possible treatment. A prospective, experimental, between groups design was used in conjunction with a three-day restraint/shock PTSD stress model. Sixty rats were randomly assigned between two groups, non-stressed and stressed (PTSD). Each of the main two groups was then randomly assigned into six experimental groups: control vehicle, control PGB, control naïve, PTSD vehicle, PTSD Pre-PGB (prophylactic), PTSD Post-PGB (non-prophylactic). The neurobehavioral components of PTSD were evaluated using the elevated plus maze (EPM), Morris water maze (MWM), and forced swim test (FST). Pregabalin administered 24 hours before the initial PTSD event or for 10 days following the last PTSD stress event did not statistically improve mean open arm exploration on the EPM, spatial memory, and learning in the MWM or behavioral despair measured by the FST (p > 0.05)."

The median age at the first visit was 55.6 years (range 1-90 years). MRI findings of tumor size, margin, lobulation, intratumoral hemorrhage, peritumoral edema, and tumor-fascia relationship were compared with the final histological diagnosis and tumor grade.Univariate analysis revealed significant relationships between histologically malignant lesions and tumor size ≥5 cm (p = 0.035), positive peritumoral edema (p = 0.031), and tumor-fascia relationship (p<0.001), but not margin (p = 0.107), lobulation (p = 0.071), and intratumoral hemorrhage (p = 0.17). In addition, using multivariate analysis, the tumor-fascia relationship (p<0.001) and tumor size were significant factors. A significant correlation between tumor-fascia relationship and malignancy (p<0.001) was observed; such a relationship was, however, not observed for tumor grade (p = 0.43).Tumors measuring ≥5 cm and the tumor-fascia relationship on magnetic resonance imaging are highly indicative of malignancy. When superficial soft tissue masses cross the superficial fascia and form obtuse angles with the fascia, sarcoma should be considered. The tumor-fascia relationship can offer surgeons useful information regarding the status of superficial soft tissue masses."

Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between various ocular parameters and the presence of VF defects.We retrospectively included 100 eyes of 50 myopic POAG subjects. (Mean age: 50.1 ± 10.0 years). The tilt ratio was similar between the paired eyes. The degree of optic disc rotation (12.96 ± 7.21°) in eyes with VF defects were statistically greater than the contralateral eyes (6.86 ± 4.30°; P < 0.001) without VF defect. The β-zone PPA-to-disc area ratio was significantly greater in eyes with VF defects than the contralateral eyes (P = 0.024) without VF defect. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the greater degree of optic disc rotation was significantly associated with the presence of VF defects (P < 0.001). However, tilt ratio, β-zone PPA-to-disc area ratio, refractive error, and axial length were not associated with the presence of VF defects.Among the morphologic features of myopic ONH, only the greater degree of the optic disc rotation was associated with the presence of VF defects in myopic subjects with POAG."
https://openalex.org/W2908467263,"Background Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative condition which also has effects on the heart. In 96% of affected individuals FRDA is due to homozygosity of a GAA repeat expansion in intron 1 of the frataxin (FXN) gene. The number of GAA repeats have been shown to relate to disease severity in FRDA, this thought to be via an inverse relationship of GAA repeat number and cellular frataxin levels. We investigated the effects of FRDA on regional long axis function of the left and right ventricles, and also the relationship of long axis systolic (s`) and early diastolic (e`) peak velocities with GAA repeat number on the shorter (GAA1) and longer FXN alleles (GAA2). Methods The study group of 78 adult subjects (age 32±9 years) with FRDA and normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction were compared to 54 healthy control subjects of similar age, sex and body size. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) signals were recorded at the mitral annulus for measurement of s`and e`of the septal, lateral, anterior and inferior walls and at the tricuspid annulus for measurement of right ventricular (RV) s`and e`. Results All the regional LV s`and e`, and both RV s`and RV e`, were lower in individuals with FRDA compared to controls (p<0.001 for all). On multivariate analysis, which included LV septal wall thickness (SWT), RV s`and RV e`were both inversely correlated with GAA1 (β = -0.32 & -0.33, respectively, p = 0.01), but not with GAA2, whereas anterior and lateral s`were both inversely correlated with GAA2 (β = -0.25 and β = -0.28, p = 0.02) but not with GAA1. Increasing SWT was the most consistent LV structural correlate of lower s`and e`, whereas age was a consistent inverse correlate of e`but not of s`. Conclusion There are generalized abnormalities of both LV regional and RV long axis function in FRDA, but there are also regional differences in the association of this dysfunction with the smaller and larger GAA repeats in the FXN gene."
https://openalex.org/W2908077427,"The Sturgeon chub (Macrhybopsis gelida) is a cyprinid fish native to the Missouri and Mississippi River basins of the U.S. Suspected long-term declines in the size of its distribution have prompted a review of its conservation status by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a process which depends on reliable methods to delineate the distribution and status of extant populations. To facilitate monitoring of Sturgeon chub populations, we developed a quantitative PCR assay to detect Sturgeon chub DNA in environmental samples. The assay consistently detected Sturgeon chub DNA in concentrations as low as 2 copies per reaction, and did not amplify DNA from non-target fish species that are sympatric in the upper Missouri River basin. Field tests of this assay with environmental samples successfully detected Sturgeon chub from sites known to be occupied. This assay offers an extremely sensitive methodology that can be applied to determine the range of Sturgeon chub, regardless of variation in habitat characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2908408846,"The objective of the study was to develop an ex-vivo PK/PD model of intramuscular (IM) administration of tulathromycin and to test its efficacy against Haemophilus parasuis (H. parasuis) infection in intraperitoneal-inoculated neutropenic guinea pigs. The pharmacokinetics (PKs) of tulathromycin at doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg in H. parasuis-infected neutropenic guinea pig were studied by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). In vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), mutant prevention concentration (MPC), post-antibiotic effect (PAE) and dynamic time-kill curve experiments were carried out using H. parasuis strain 13R. Tulathromycin exhibited concentration-dependent activity and PAE persisted long after administration of the antibiotic. The ratio of the 24-h area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to MIC in serum (AUC24h/MICserum) was recognized as an important PK/PD parameter that positively correlated with the in vitro antibacterial effectiveness of tulathromycin (R2 = 0.9961 or R2 = 1). For the 1 and 10 mg/kg treatments with tulathromycin, the values of AUC24h/MIC for H. parasuis bacteriostatic action, bactericidal action and virtual bacterial eradication were respectively 22.73, 34.5 and 88.03 h for the 1 mg/kg treatment and respectively 24.94, 30.94 and 49.92 h for the 10 mg/kg treatment. In addition, we demonstrated that doses of 7.2-8.0 mg/kg of tulathromycin resulted in high eradication rates (99.99%). Using a previously published conversion factor of 0.296, we were able to estimate an approximate dose, 2.1-2.4 mg/kg, that should also obtain high eradication rates in the target animal, pigs. This study can help optimize tulathromycin efficacy against H. parasuis infections in swine farming."
https://openalex.org/W2906904582,"The spinal cord contains the neural circuitry needed to generate rhythmic walking motions, and afferent sensory feedbacks are involved in the control of locomotion. In this study, we examined the influence of periodic electrical stimulation on the change in gait cycle period during treadmill walking. 40 subjects walked on a treadmill while receiving periodic bursts of electrical stimulation at various perturbation periods (-20, -40, -60, +20, +40 milliseconds from their initial gait cycle periods). Eleven subjects received electrical stimulation to the hamstring, and 29 received electrical stimulation to the calf. Each subject completed four trials; two trials were conducted using high amplitude stimulation causing a slight degree of joint motion, and the other two trials were conducted using reduced amplitude stimulation which did not cause observable motion. Through the trials, we sought to answer the following questions: 1) does the amplitude of electrical stimulation have an effect on the level of entrainment? 2) does the stimulation site effect the level of entrainment? Entrainment refers to the synchronization of gait cycle period to the period of electrical stimulation. The results showed that entrainment was observed when the perturbation periods were induced relatively close to the subject's initial gait cycle period. For both stimulation sites, entrainment was shown in 59% of subjects at +/- 20 milliseconds from the initial gait cycle period. With reduced amplitude, entrainment was still observed (51% all stimulation site groups at +/- 20 milliseconds). In addition, after-effects following electrical perturbation were present as seen by changes in the mean gait cycle period. Our results suggest that human locomotor control is organized with a semi-autonomous peripheral oscillator influenced by afferent information, and that electrical stimulation has the potential to be a simpler, and cost-effective tool for locomotion rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2907308072,"Background Low-velocity motor vehicle crashes often lead to severe and chronic neck disorders also referred to as whiplash-associated disorders (WAD). The etiology of WAD is still not fully understood. Many studies using a real or simulated collision scenario have focused on rear-end collisions, whereas the kinematics and muscular responses during frontal-oblique collisions have hardly been investigated. In particular for rear-end collisions, drivers were shown to have a higher WAD risk than front seat passengers. Yet, independently from the impact direction, neither the muscular nor the kinematic responses of drivers and front seat passengers have been compared to date, although some findings indicate that the neck muscles have the potential to alter the head and neck kinematics, and that the level of neck muscle activity during impact may be relevant for the emergence of WAD. Objective In this study, we quantitatively examined the subjects’ neck muscle activity during low-velocity left-frontal-oblique impacts to gain further insights into the neuromuscular mechanism underlying whiplash-like perturbations that may lead to WAD. Methods In a within-subject study design, we varied several impact parameters to investigate their effect on neck muscle response amplitude and delay. Fifty-two subjects experienced at least ten collisions while controlling for the following parameters: change in velocity Δv (3 / 6 km/h), seating position (driver / front seat passenger), and deliberate pre-tension of the musculature (tense / relaxed) to account for a potential difference between an expected and an unexpected crash. Ten of the 52 subjects additionally ran the same experimental conditions as above, but without wearing a safety belt. Findings There were significant main effects of Δv and muscle pre-tension on the reflex amplitude but not of seating position. As for the reflex delay, there was a significant main effect of muscle pre-tension, but neither of Δv nor of seating position. Moreover, neither the safety belt nor its asymmetrical orientation had an influence on the reflexive responses of the occupants. Conclusion In summary, we did not find any significant differences in the reflex amplitude and delay of the neck musculature between drivers and front seat passengers. We therefore concluded that an increased risk of the driver sustaining WAD in frontal-oblique collisions, if it exists, cannot be due to differences in the reflexive responses."
https://openalex.org/W2907316407,"We recently identified three novel thioredoxin-like genes in the genome of the protozoan parasite Plasmodium that belong to the Phosducin-like family of proteins (PhLP). PhLPs are small cytosolic proteins hypothesized to function in G-protein signaling and protein folding. Although PhLPs are highly conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals, only a few representatives have been experimentally characterized to date. In addition, while PhLPs contain a thioredoxin domain, they lack a CXXC motif, a strong indicator for redox activity, and it is unclear whether members of the PhLP family are enzymatically active. Here, we describe PbPhLP-3 as the first phosducin-like protein of a protozoan organism, Plasmodium berghei. Initial transcription analysis revealed continuous low-level expression of pbphlp-3 throughout the complex Plasmodium life cycle. Attempts to knockout pbphlp-3 in P. berghei did not yield live parasites, suggesting an essential role for the gene in Plasmodium. We cloned, expressed and purified PbPhLP-3 and determined that the recombinant protein is redox active in vitro in a thioredoxin-coupled redox assay. It also has the capacity to reduce the organic compound tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in vitro, albeit at low efficiency. Sequence analysis, structural modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis revealed a conserved cysteine in the thioredoxin domain to be the redox active residue. Lastly, we provide evidence that recombinant human PhLP-3 exhibits redox activity similar to that of PbPhLP-3 and suggest that redox activity may be conserved in PhLP-3 homologs of other species. Our data provide new insight into the function of PhLP-3, which is hypothesized to act as co-chaperones in the folding and regulation of cytoskeletal proteins. We discuss the potential implications of PhLP-3 as a thioredoxin-target protein and possible links between the cellular redox network and the eukaryotic protein folding machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2908321454,"We analyzed treatment outcomes and prognostic factors in adult patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs) to select patients who would be benefited by active anticancer treatment. After excluding 18 patients who received palliative care only and 13 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, 72 t-MN patients (45 with acute myeloid leukemia and 27 with myelodysplastic syndrome) were retrospectively evaluated. Among them, 10 (13.9%), 32 (44.4%), and 30 patients (41.7%) had favorable, intermediate- and adverse-risk cytogenetics, respectively. Among patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, patients with a normal karyotype (NK; N = 20) showed superior allogeneic stem cell transplantation-censored overall survival (AC-OS) and OS compared to those with non-NK-intermediate-risk cytogenetics (P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, male sex, age ≥ 70 years, and unfavorable cytogenetics (non-NK-intermediate plus adverse risk cytogenetics) were associated with inferior AC-OS. Those results suggest that a more-refined subdivision of risk stratification would be necessary in patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics."
https://openalex.org/W2907616551,"Metal nanoparticles (NPs) fabricated by means of the solid state dewetting (SSD) approach are applicable in many optoelectronic, biomedical and catalytical applications. However, the fabrication of metallic NPs with the low diffusivity elements such as platinum (Pt) has been challenging for the well-defined configuration and uniformity due to the low diffusivity of Pt atoms and thus the optical properties suffer. In this paper, the evolution of well-defined configuration and improved uniformity of Pt NPs are demonstrated by the altered solid state dewetting (ASSD) approach using a sacrificial indium (In) layer. Upon annealing, the high diffusivity In atoms can lead to the formation of In-Pt alloy due to the inter-mixing at the interface and the dewetting process advances along with the enhanced diffusion of In-Pt alloy atoms. Eventually, well-defined Pt NPs are formed by means of complete desorption of In atoms by sublimation. By the control of In and Pt ratio in the bilayers with the fixed total thickness such as In4.5 nm/Pt1.5 nm, In3 nm/Pt3 nm, In1.5 nm/Pt4.5 nm, the isolated dome shaped Pt NPs of various size are demonstrated, which reflects the significant impact of In component in the dewetting process. The optical characterization of Pt NPs exhibits the formation of quadrupolar resonance and strong dipolar resonance bands in the UV and VIS regions respectively, which are tunable based on the morphology of Pt NPs. In specific, the dipolar resonance peaks demonstrate a red shifting behavior with the increment of size of Pt NPs and gradually become narrower along with the improvement of uniformity of Pt NPs."
https://openalex.org/W2907778389,"In animals, color signals that convey information about quality are often associated with costs linked to the expression of coloration and may therefore be honest signals of sender quality. Honest indicators are often seen in sexual signals that are used by males to advertise quality to females. Carotenoid and pterin pigments are responsible for yellow, orange, and red coloration in a variety of taxa, but can also serve important roles as antioxidants by reducing free radicals in the body. In this study, we test the effects of a novel full-bodied orange color phenotype of the brown anole, Anolis sagrei, on mate choice, physiology, and survival. We found no evidence that lizards expressing the orange phenotype were preferred by females. Additionally, they did not differ in immune function, running endurance, or maximum sprint speed from lizards that did not express the novel phenotype. Pigment extractions revealed that orange body coloration resulted from pterin pigments and not carotenoids. Visual models suggest that the orange phenotype is less conspicuous to bird predators than the brown phenotype and may provide an adaptive explanation for the persistence of this trait. Given its small, yet positive effect on fitness, we expect the orange color phenotype to increase in frequency in subsequent decades."
https://openalex.org/W2908015999,"Haplotype-based methods compete with ""one-SNP-at-a-time"" approaches on being preferred for association studies. Chromosome 6 contains most of the known genetic biomarkers for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease. Therefore, chromosome 6 serves as a benchmark for the haplotype methods testing. The aim of this study is to test the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) dataset to find out if haplotype block methods or single-locus approaches alone can sufficiently provide the significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with RA. In addition, could we be satisfied with only one method of the haplotype block methods for partitioning chromosome 6 of the NARAC dataset? In the NARAC dataset, chromosome 6 comprises 35,574 SNPs for 2,062 individuals (868 cases, 1,194 controls). Individual SNP approach and three haplotype block methods were applied to the NARAC dataset to identify the RA biomarkers. We employed three haplotype partitioning methods which are confidence interval test (CIT), four gamete test (FGT), and solid spine of linkage disequilibrium (SSLD). P-values after stringent Bonferroni correction for multiple testing were measured to assess the strength of association between the genetic variants and RA susceptibility. Moreover, the block size (in base pairs (bp) and number of SNPs included), number of blocks, percentage of uncovered SNPs by the block method, percentage of significant blocks from the total number of blocks, number of significant haplotypes and SNPs were used to compare among the three haplotype block methods. Individual SNP, CIT, FGT, and SSLD methods detected 432, 1,086, 1,099, and 1,322 associated SNPs, respectively. Each method identified significant SNPs that were not detected by any other method (Individual SNP: 12, FGT: 37, CIT: 55, and SSLD: 189 SNPs). 916 SNPs were discovered by all the three haplotype block methods. 367 SNPs were discovered by the haplotype block methods and the individual SNP approach. The P-values of these 367 SNPs were lower than those of the SNPs uniquely detected by only one method. The 367 SNPs detected by all the methods represent promising candidates for RA susceptibility. They should be further investigated for the European population. A hybrid technique including the four methods should be applied to detect the significant SNPs associated with RA for chromosome 6 of the NARAC dataset. Moreover, SSLD method may be preferred for its favored benefits in case of selecting only one method."
https://openalex.org/W2908364331,"Following an anterior cruciate ligament injury, premenopausal females tend to experience poorer outcomes than males, and sex hormones are thought to contribute to the disparity. Evidence seems to suggest that the sex hormones estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone may regulate the inflammation caused by macrophages, which invade the knee after an injury. While the individual effects of hormones on macrophage inflammation have been studied in vitro, their combined effects on post-injury inflammation in the knee have not been examined, even though both males and females have detectable levels of both estrogen and testosterone. In the present work, we developed an in silico kinetic model of the post-injury inflammatory response in the human knee joint and the hormonal influences that may shape that response. Our results indicate that post-injury, sex hormone concentrations observed in females may lead to a more pro-inflammatory, catabolic environment, while the sex hormone concentrations observed in males may lead to a more anti-inflammatory environment. These findings suggest that the female hormonal milieu may lead to increased catabolism, potentially worsening post-injury damage to the cartilage for females compared to males. The model developed herein may inform future in vitro and in vivo studies that seek to uncover the origins of sex differences in outcomes and may ultimately serve as a starting point for developing targeted therapies to prevent or reduce the cartilage damage that results from post-injury inflammation, particularly for females."
