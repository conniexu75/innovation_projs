https://openalex.org/W1973535425,"Cluster analysis of Cambrian-Ordovician marine benthic communities and community-trophic analysis of Late Cretaceous shelf faunas indicate that major ecological innovations appeared in nearshore environments and then expanded outward across the shelf at the expense of older community types. This onshore-innovation, offshore-archaic evolutionary pattern is surprising in light of the generally higher species turnover rates of offshore clades. This pattern probably results from differential extinction rates of onshore as compared to offshore clades, or from differential origination rates of new ecological associations or evolutionary novelties in nearshore environments."
https://openalex.org/W2063198355,"A study of effects of terrestrial biota on the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere suggests that the global net release of carbon due to forest clearing between 1860 and 1980 was between 135 x 10(15) and 228 x 10(15) grams. Between 1.8 x 10(15) and 4.7 x 10(15) grams of carbon were released in 1980, of which nearly 80 percent was due to deforestation, principally in the tropics. The annual release of carbon from the biota and soils exceeded the release from fossil fuels until about 1960. Because the biotic release has been and remains much larger than is commonly assumed, the airborne fraction, usually considered to be about 50 percent of the release from fossil fuels, was probably between 22 and 43 percent of the total carbon released in 1980. The increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is thought by some to be increasing the storage of carbon in the earth's remaining forests sufficiently to offset the release from deforestation. The interpretation of the evidence presented here suggests no such effect; deforestation appears to be the dominant biotic effect on atmospheric carbon dioxide. If deforestation increases in proportion to population, the biotic release of carbon will reach 9 x 10(15) grams per year before forests are exhausted early in the next century. The possibilities for limiting the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere through reduction in use of fossil fuels and through management of forests may be greater than is commonly assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2031019425,"Airborne particulate matter from the January 1983 eruption of Kilauea volcano was inadvertently collected on air filters at Mauna Loa Observatory at a sampling station used to observe particles in global circulation. Analyses of affected samples revealed unusually large concentrations of selenium, arsenic, indium, gold, and sulfur, as expected for volcanic emissions. Strikingly large concentrations of iridium were also observed, the ratio of iridium to aluminum being 17,000 times its value in Hawaiian basalt. Since iridium enrichments have not previously been observed in volcanic emissions, the results for Kilauea suggest that it is part of an unusual volcanic system which may be fed by magma from the mantle. The iridium enrichment appears to be linked with the high fluorine content of the volcanic gases, which suggests that the iridium is released as a volatile IrF(6)."

The virtual disappearance is consistent with the basin-wide adjustment of sea surface slope to the strong westerly winds in the western and central Pacific that caused the 1982-1983 El Ni√±o event."
https://openalex.org/W2022794420,"A potting soil mixture depleted carbon monoxide in a test atmosphere from a concentration of 120 parts per million to near zero within 3 hours. Maximum activity occurred at 30 degrees C. Steam sterilization of the soil, the addition of antibiotics or 10 percent (by weight) saline solution, and anaerobic conditions all prevented carbon monoxide uptake. Sterilized soil inoculated with nonsterile soil acquired activity with time. Samples of various natural soils differed in their ability to remove carbon monoxide from the air. Acidic soils with a high content of organic matter were generally the most active. The soil's ability to remove carbon monoxide from the atmosphere is ascribed to the activity of soil micro-organisms."

https://openalex.org/W1987124291,"Studies of coastal erosion and coastal management can be put on a firm physical basis only after methods have been developed for closely estimating the energy expended in actual unidirectional net littoral transport of sediment. Such measures have now been obtained for six coastal drift cells. The results, for a 68-year period, vary from a minimum of 0.6 x 10(4) ergs (very low energy) to a maximum of 340 x 10(4) ergs (moderately high energy) per cell."
