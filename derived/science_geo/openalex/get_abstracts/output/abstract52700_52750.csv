https://openalex.org/W1606935319,Abstract The purple membrane from Halobacterium halobium was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles. On illumination (2 x 106 ergs per cm2 per s) the reconstituted vesicles took up protons (50 to 200 ng of ions H+ per mg of purple protein) which were released in the dark. Addition of valinomycin accelerated both the rate of uptake in the light and the release of protons in the dark. Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation abolished the uptake of protons. Inclusion of the mitochondrial oligomycin-sensitive ATPase during reconstitution yielded vesicles which catalyzed light-dependent phosphorylation. These reconstituted vesicles represent a simple model system for a biological proton pump capable of generating ATP from ADP and Pi.

The activity of this enzyme was stimulated 20-fold to an activity of 100 to 120 µmoles of Pi per mg of protein per hour by either phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylglycerol. The effect of the fluidity of the hydrocarbon region of the phospholipid bilayers on this re-activation of (Na + K)-ATPase was systematically examined. Fatty acyl chains of known length and varying saturation were substituted on the phosphatidylglycerol moiety and the influence of temperature on the degree of re-activation was investigated. Discontinuities in Arrhenius plots of (Na + K)-ATPase activity were found and compared with the gel-to-liquid-crystalline transitions of these substituted phosphatidylglycerols as measured in a differential scanning calorimeter. The temperature at which the Arrhenius plot discontinuities occurred were from 1° to 8° lower than the initial rise of the main endothermic peak for the series: dimyristoyl-, dipalmitoyl-, and distearoylphosphatidylglycerols. Dioleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol which does not undergo a phase transition within the experimental temperature range was found to activate at much lower concentrations than the saturated phosphatidylglycerols, and the Arrhenius plot did not show discontinuities. In contrast, bovine brain phosphatidylserine with a heterogeneous fatty acyl chain composition showed an Arrhenius plot discontinuity which was 2° higher than the midpoint of the broad endothermic peak. The relation between the discontinuities in the Arrhenius plots of the enzyme activity and the lipid phase transitions is discussed. It is suggested that some of the discontinuities represent the completion of melting (upper limit for a broad endothermic transition), whereas others represent the beginning of melting (lower limit). For completely liquid membranes, the slopes of the Arrhenius plots are parallel and give an activation energy of approximately 15 Cal per mole. The influence of membrane fluidity was also studied by examining the effects of cholesterol at constant temperature (37°). In agreement with the above findings, cholesterol, which is known to reduce the fluidity of phospholipid fatty acyl chains, inhibits phospholipid-stimulated (Na + K)-ATPase activity. The inhibition is complete, however, only with saturated phospholipids. Partial inhibition is obtained with unsaturated phospholipids. These results are discussed in relation to phase transitions in phospholipid bilayers and biomembranes and the activity of membrane-bound enzymes. A role of cholesterol in controlling the activity of membrane-bound enzymes is suggested. Implications for protein-lipid interactions in membranes are also considered."

https://openalex.org/W1482605569,"Abstract Seven proteins have been isolated from sarcoplasmic reticulum. These proteins have been identified as an ATPase, a series of water soluble, acidic proteins of molecular weights 55,000, 46,500, 38,000, 33,000, and 20,000, and a proteolipid. The interactions of the acidic proteins with Ca2+ have been measured at pH 7.5 in the presence and absence of 0.1 m KCl. The protein of molecular weight 55,000 is the only protein with high affinity for Ca2+. In the presence of 0.1 m KCl it binds 16 to 22 nmoles of Ca2+ per mg (about 1 mole of Ca2+ with a dissociation constant between 2.5 and 4 µm. It also binds several hundred nanomoles of Ca2+ with a dissociation constant greater than 5,000 µm. In the absence of KCl the protein of molecular weight 55,000 displays the high affinity Ca2+ binding site and sites which bind about 460 nmoles of Ca2+ per mg with a dissociation constant of about 120 µm. In the presence of 0.1 m KCl, calsequestrin (mol wt 46,500) does not show high affinity Ca2+ binding but binds about 850 nmoles of Ca2+ per mg with a dissociation constant of about 800 µm. In the absence of KCl, calsequestrin binds about 900 nmoles of Ca2+ per mg with a dissociation constant of about 60 µm. In the absence of KCl the acidic proteins with molecular weights between 20,000 and 38,000 bind from 900 to 1,100 nmoles of Ca2+ per mg with dissociation constants in the range of 115 to 150 µm. Apparent high affinity Ca2+ binding is observed in these fractions in the absence of KCl but, in the presence of 0.1 m KCl, both the apparent high affinity Ca2+ binding and the low affinity binding are greatly reduced."
https://openalex.org/W1555498397,"A new method for identification and characterization of an acyl phosphate linkage in phosphorylated proteins is presented. The method involves reductive cleavage of the acyl phosphate bond with sodium [3H]borohydride to form a labeled aminohydroxy acid residue. [3H]Borohydride reduction of the phosphorylated (Ca2+, Mg2+)-adenosine triphosphatase of sarcoplasmic reticulum, followed by analysis of the acid hydrolysate of the reduced enzyme, showed the formation of labeled homoserine. The results demonstrate that the phosphoryl group of sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase is attached to the β-carboxyl group of an aspartyl residue at the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1602992567,"Abstract Particles 30 to 40 A in diameter are attached to the external surface of negatively stained membrane vesicles formed by the ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum. These particles are identical with the surface particles of isolated, intact sarcoplasmic reticulum first described by Ikemoto et al. (Ikemoto, N., Sreter, F. A., and Gergely, J. (1966) Fed. Proc. 25, 465). Tryptic digestion was used in an attempt to determine whether these particles were structural features of the ATPase protein. Treatment of sarcoplasmic reticulum with trypsin caused an initial activation but eventual decline of the ATPase activity to about one-fourth of the initial activity. Surface particles were missing only after the ATPase activity was reduced 3- to 4-fold. Protection of ATPase activity with sucrose or ATP during trypsin digestion also protected against loss of the surface particles. Trypsin digestion initially cleaved the ATPase protein to two peptides of molecular weights 45,000 and 55,000 without loss of the ATPase activity. These peptides did not represent native subunits of the ATPase since the molecular weight of the undigested ATPase was found to be 102,000 under a variety of conditions reported to break the molecule down to sub- units. An active ATPase containing only tryptic peptides could be isolated from digested sarcoplasmic reticulum. Continued digestion cleaved the ATPase to peptides of molecular weight about 10,000 and cleavage to these lower molecular weight peptides was correlated with loss of ATPase activity and loss of surface particles. Freeze fracture profiles of intact membranes revealed an asymmetric arrangement of 90- to 100-A globules in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. The globules were still present in membranes from which the surface particles were removed by tryptic digestion and in which the ATPase was cleaved to very small peptides. These peptides were not solubilized by trypsin but remained membrane bound. We suggest that the ATPase protein consists of a hydrophobic globular portion embedded in the membrane and a hydrophilic extension, part of which is observed as a surface particle under conditions of negative staining."
https://openalex.org/W2139046781,"Abstract Developmental changes in the protein, phospholipid, cholesterol, and fatty acid composition of skeletal and cardiac microsomes were correlated with Ca2+ transport activity in chicken embryos and during the early postnatal period. In skeletal muscle microsomes isolated from leg, superficial pectoralis, or deep pectoralis muscles, the rapid increase in the rate and extent of calcium accumulation around the time of hatching was accompanied by increase in total and Ca2+-sensitive ATPase activity, the concentration of phosphoprotein intermediate and the amount of transport ATPase enzyme determined by gel electrophoresis. The increased enzyme content of the membrane is reflected in its increased density and a marked decrease in phospholipid to protein ratio with development. The concentration of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylinositol changed relatively little during the first 50 days of development but the appearance of calcium transport activity was accompanied by a marked decrease in the palmitate and increase in the linoleate content of membrane phospholipids and a decrease in cholesterol concentration. These changes were clearly apparent in purified sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes isolated by calcium loading or in less pure membrane fractions obtained by differential or sucrose gradient centrifugation. Corresponding but much less pronounced changes in the enzymatic activity of cardiac microsomes were observed during development. Although the observations are consistent with nearly all possible mechanisms of membrane assembly they may suggest that the phospholipid-rich membranes of embryonic muscle are gradually converted during development into calcium-transporting structures by stepwise insertion of the ATPase enzyme and other components of the transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1484207997,"Abstract The different anatomical regions of the epiphysis (the cartilaginous portion of tibia and femur) of 12-day-old chick embryo have been examined for heterogeneities in proteoglycan structure that might relate to the mechanism of cytodifferentiation. The results indicate that the ratio of 4-sulfate to 6-sulfate unit of the chondroitin sulfate moiety may mirror the stage of cytodifferentiation; i.e. in going from the diaphysial region (Zone 4) to the epiphysial region (Zone 1), endogenous proteoglycans preformed in ovo showed structural changes indicating transition from a molecule or a group of molecules with relatively 6-sulfate-rich chondroitin sulfate chains to one with 4-sulfate-rich chains. Further analyses of the proteoglycan samples have revealed that they consisted of two macromolecular species of different molecular weights. If the cartilage segment was pulse-labeled with 35SO42- or [U-14C]glucose, the slower sedimenting component (Component L) had a much higher specific activity than the faster sedimenting component (Component H). Comparison of the labeled proteoglycans thus separated has indicated that both Component L and Component H exhibited the same trend of regional variation in sulfate location (i.e. the molecules in the epiphysial region tend to be higher in the proportion of 4-sulfate than those in the diaphysial region), but the polysaccharide chains of Component L were always richer in 4-sulfate and larger in average size than those of Component H concurrently formed in the same zone. Although all the zones of the cartilage could synthesize the two proteoglycan components, the cells in the epiphysial region tended to be higher in ratio of Component L synthesis to Component H synthesis than the cells in the diaphysial region."
https://openalex.org/W1604248953,"Abstract The reconstitution of functional sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles has been achieved. Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles at a concentration of 7.0 mg of protein per ml are solubilized with the use of 3.4 mg per ml of deoxycholate. The solubilized sample is nonmembranous as viewed in the electron microscope. Sedimentation studies indicate it is dissociated largely into protein and phospholipid. Removal of the detergent by dialysis results in the reaggregation of protein and phospholipid to form membranous vesicles which are capable of energized Ca2+ accumulation. The reconstitution is temperature dependent being optimal at about 20°; function is not restored if dialysis is carried out at 0–4°. The composition of the dialysis buffer which favors reconstitution is 0.4 m KCI, 1.5 mm Mg2+-1.0 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and 0.1 mm Ca2+, pH 7.25. Reconstituted and original sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles have a similar phospholipid content and buoyant density. The Ca2+ pump protein is the major protein in both reconstituted and original vesicles; however, the two other major proteins with a molecular weight of approximately 55,000 are only in part rebound. The reconstituted vesicles have an elevated adenosine triphosphatase activity. Energized Ca2+ uptake capacities measured in the presence and absence of oxalate are restored to about 50% and 25%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1534412090,"Abstract Myosin was extracted from guinea pig polymorphonuclear leukocytes (granulocytes) homogenized in either 0.6 m KCl or 0.34 m sucrose solutions. It was purified by precipitation at low ionic strength, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and gel filtration with buffers containing KI and ATP. Myosin isolated from sucrose extracts of granulocytes consisted of essentially one polypeptide that co-migrated with the heavy chain of skeletal muscle myosin on sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Antibody against this protein was prepared in rabbits and reacted with it to yield one precipitin line by immunodiffusion. Myosin isolated from extracts of cells prepared with 0.6 m KCl was heterogenous by electrophoresis and immunodiffusion probably because of partial degradation by lysosomal enzymes solubilized by KCl but not by sucrose. All myosin preparations reacted with antiserum to yield at least two arcs on immunoelectrophoresis. Granulocyte myosin, like other myosins, had EDTA- and calcium- but not magnesium-activated ATPase activity in 0.6 m KCl, and it bound skeletal muscle F-actin in the absence but not the presence of ATP. At low ionic strength the Mg2+ATPase activity of granulocyte myosin was activated by skeletal muscle F-actin. This activation was not influenced by calcium. However, under the influence of skeletal muscle troponin-tropomyosin, activation of granulocyte myosin Mg2+ATPase by skeletal muscle F-actin occurred only after addition of calcium. In 0.12 m KCl, granulocyte myosin formed thin short bipolar filaments in the presence of divalent cations. Actin was identified in granulocyte extracts as a protein which comigrated with skeletal muscle actin on sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis and which formed filaments that bound granulocyte myosin to form polarized arrowhead structures."
https://openalex.org/W1567149769,"Abstract The role of the interaction of Ca2+ with the purified Ca2+-dependent ATPase in the regulation of enzyme activity has been investigated. It appears that the sensitivity to Ca2+ of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in activation and inhibition of ATPase activity, is intrinsic to the ATPase moiety of the membrane. Three types of Ca2+ binding sites have been found in equilibrium dialysis studies. In the absence of ATP there is approximately one of each per 105 daltons; the binding constants are 4 x 106 m-1 (α site), 4 x 104 (β site), and 1 x 103 (γ site). Addition of 1.5 mm ATP slightly increases the affinity of all sites and reduces the apparent capacity of the α and β sites. Study of ATP hydrolysis in parallel with calcium binding has shown that Ca2+ binding at the α site activates it and binding to the γ site inhibits it, while binding of Ca2+ to the β site appears not to be involved in the enzymatic regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1483651803,"Abstract The ATPase of lobster abdominal muscle microsomes may be partially purified by addition of lysolecithin (1 to 2 mg per mg of protein) followed by differential centrifugation. The pellet contains most of the ATPase activity and the specific activity is increased 2-fold. The ATPase composes half the protein of the crude microsomes and 70 to 80% of the protein of a purified microsome fraction. Lysolecithin displaces much of the lipid of the microsomes and represents 65% of the lipid phosphate in the lysolecithin-ATPase complex. Polyacrylamide gel analysis of the ATPase preparation shows a single major band of 105,000 daltons. This band is not affected by reduction with mercaptoethanol. Freeze-etch microscopy of the microsomes reveals numerous 70- to 80-A particles within the plane of the membranes. In the lysolecithin-ATPase complex similar particles compose essentially all of the membrane fracture surface as viewed by freeze-etching. These results are in agreement with an earlier suggestion that the freeze-etch particles of the microsomes are correlated with calcium transport ATPase sites."
https://openalex.org/W1533674408,"Abstract This and the succeeding paper report the structural properties of the major exocellular glycopeptide produced by Penicillium charlesii on shake culture. Treatment of the purified glycopeptide with 0.4 n NaOH resulted in the formation of mono-, di-, tri-, and polysaccharide fractions which were separated by gel permeation chromatography. The polysaccharide was characterized by: (a) methylation and gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of the products, (b) acetolysis followed by separating the products on a Bio-Gel P-2 column, and (c) Smith degradation followed by separation and identification of glycerol and threitol by gas-liquid chromatography. These investigations show that the polysaccharide (phosphogalactomannan) contains approximately 90 mannopyranosyl residues and a variable number of galactofuranosyl residues. Acetolysis resulted in the formation of mannopentaose, mannotetraose, mannotriose, mannobiose, and mannose in the ratio of 2:11:4:5:13, respectively. Analysis of the methylated products and nuclear magnetic resonance studies indicate that the mannopyranosyl residues are linked to one another primarily through α(1→2)- and α(1→6)O-glycosidic linkages. The glycopeptide also contains 8 to 10 polygalactofuranosyl chains of variable length, each of which is attached to the C-3 atom of a mannopyranosyl residue. Each galactofuranoside is attached by β(1 →5)O-glycosidic linkage to the adjoinng galactofuranosyl residue. The polymer contains 9 to 10 phosphorus atoms per mole, and they occur in the mannan as phosphodiesters. The phosphorus atoms are not attached to the same mannopyranosyl residues to which the polygalactofuranosyl chains are linked."
https://openalex.org/W1564778743,"Abstract Prior studies of the viscosity of the subunit proteoglycan obtained by dissociative extraction of bovine nasal septum cartilage suggested that the proteoglycan subunit molecule behaves as a rigid rod in aqueous solution over the range of 0.5 to 4.0 m guanidine hydrochloride. A more direct view of dimension and shape can be obtained from light-scattering and viscosity of bovine nasal cartilage proteoglycan subunit over the range from 0.05 to 4.0 m guanidine hydrochloride. The molecular weight, radius of gyration, second virial coefficient, and intrinsic viscosity were determined. The weight average molecular weight of the proteoglycan subunit was constant (2.3 x 105) at all guanidine hydrochloride concentrations. The radius of gyration decreased from a value of 1590 A in 0.05 m guanidine hydrochloride to 570 A in 4.0 m guanidine hydrochloride, and there were changes in the second virial coefficient indicating a major change in solvent-proteoglycan subunit interaction in the 0.15 to 4.0 m guanidine hydrochloride range. The second virial coefficient goes from a minimum value of -7.0 x 10-5 ml g-2 mole in 0.15 m guanidine hydrochloride to a value of 5.7 x 10-5 ml g-2 mole in 4.0 m guanidine hydrochloride. At concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride greater than 0.5 m, the viscosity was nearly constant. These data suggest that at low ionic strength in guanidine hydrochloride, the proteoglycan subunit is a rather rigid structure, but at approximately 0.3 m guanidine hydrochloride, a conformational change occurs, providing a more flexible structure which persists up to concentrations as high as 4.0 m guanidine hydrochloride. Over the same range, the separate chondroitin 4-sulfate chains show typical polyelectrolyte effects and a positive second virial coefficient ranging from +4.8 x 10-3 in 0.1 m guanidine hydrochloride to 0.6 x 10-3 in 3.0 m guanidine hydrochloride. This comparison indicates that the behavior of the intact proteoglycan subunit cannot be understood in terms of the properties of the isolated chondroitin 4-sulfate chains. It is likely that both the protein core itself and the packing of the polysaccharide chains along the core are involved in this difference."

https://openalex.org/W1592464016,Developmental changes in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and surface membranes of chicken skeletal muscles were investigated by electron microscopy. A dominant feature of freeze-etched sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes isolated from adult animals is the presence of spherical intramembranous particles of 75 A apparent diameter which are more numerous on the concave than on the convex cleaved faces. The sharp increase in the Ca2+ transport and Ca2+-sensitive ATPase activity of isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes with development is accompanied by an increase in the number of 75 A particles. Corresponding changes were observed in intact muscles where the sarcoplasmic reticulum elements can be readily identified on the basis of their characteristic disposition between the myofibrils. The reasonably close correlation between Ca2+ transport activity and the intramembranous particle density during development supports earlier suggestions that the intramembranous particles may represent the Ca2+ transport system. Similar 75 A particles were also observed on the surface membrane of skeletal muscle but in lesser density than the corresponding structures in sarcoplasmic reticulum. Their number also increases with development.
https://openalex.org/W1590787567,"Abstract The intracellular localization of the large pools of ornithine and arginine in Neurospora has been investigated. Over 90% of both amino acids were found to be associated with an osmotically sensitive organelle. This organelle, termed the vesicle, is readily distinguishable from mitochondria on sucrose gradients. The association of ornithine and arginine with this vesicle is not an artifact of cell fractionation, and appears to reflect their intracellular localization within a membrane-enclosed structure. Other amino acids also appear to be localized within the vesicle. These results provide evidence for a compartmentation mechanism which withholds endogenous ornithine and arginine from catabolic fates."
https://openalex.org/W1542397698,"Abstract The activation of human plasminogen by urokinase has been examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and by amino acid sequence analysis. Plasminogen, purified from human plasma by affinity chromatography, was found to have a molecular weight of 87,000, and an NH2-terminal sequence of Glu-Pro-Leu-Asp-Asp-Tyr-Val-Asn-Thr-Gln-Gly-. Neither lysine nor valine was detected at the NH2 terminus. Activation in the presence of 1-chloro-3-tosyl-amido-7-amino-2-heptanone resulted in the formation of a peptide with a molecular weight of 8,200 and an intermediate form of plasminogen which possessed a molecular weight of 80,000 and lysine at the NH2 terminus. This intermediate form was then converted to plasmin, composed of a heavy chain (molecular weight 55,000) and a light chain (molecular weight 26,000). The peptide cleaved prior to plasmin formation, henceforth called the pre-activation peptide, is not linked by disulfide bonds to the rest of the molecule; amino acid sequence analysis indicates that it originates from the NH2 terminus of plasminogen with NH2-terminal glutamic acid. The sequence of the first 8 NH2-terminal residues of the heavy chain of plasmin was found to be Lys-Val-Tyr-Leu-Ser-Glu-Phe-Lys-; a minor amount of the des-lysyl NH2-terminal sequence was also found. Activation of plasminogen in the absence of 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone indicated that the pre-activation peptide was not only rapidly released but also rapidly degraded. In addition, loss of plasmin activity occurred concomitantly with proteolysis of the light chain, which resulted in formation of two fragments with molecular weights of 18,000 and 6,500. Degradation of the heavy chain was not observed. The light chain fragments are joined by disulfide bonds, and are clearly different from the pre-activation peptide by several criteria. In 25% glycerol, the loss of plasmin activity was also correlated with light chain degradation; after prolonged incubation, heavy chain was also degraded to a lower molecular weight species. It is concluded that the activation of human plasminogen by urokinase occurs by the cleavage of at least two peptide bonds in a sequential manner, involving the initial release of an NH2-terminal pre-activation peptide to form an intermediate plasminogen which is then converted to the active enzyme, plasmin."
https://openalex.org/W1546989961,"Abstract Δ5-3β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and Δ5-isomerase have been extracted from exhaustively washed sheep adrenal cortical microsomes by treatment with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 and purified by ion exchange chromatography to near homogeneity. No dissociation of dehydrogenase activity on the basis of substrate specificity (3β-hydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one and 3β-hydroxypregn-5-en-20-one) was observed. The purified enzymatically active material requires detergent for aqueous solubility. A mixture of [3H]-acetyl-Triton X-100 and the purified enzymatic activities is eluted as a single band on gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-0.5m; the elution volume is exactly that required for elution of [3H]acetyl-Triton X-100 alone and corresponds to that observed for globular proteins of molecular weights in the range of 300,000. The behavior of the purified material on gel filtration probably reflects interaction of the detergent with the protein, resulting in micelle formation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment of the purified material followed by electrophoresis results in a single protein band with a mobility corresponding to a molecular weight of about 40,000. The protein band was eluted from the gels, and amino acid sequence determination was performed from the NH2-terminal end. Alanine was found as the sole NH2-terminal amino acid present, followed by glycine as the sole penultimate amino acid. The observation that steroid 3β-ol dehydrogenase and Δ5-isomerase copurify to a state approaching protein homogeneity as assessed by several methods suggests that the two enzymatic activities are closely associated. The results support and extend earlier observations that, in mammals, steroid 3β-ol dehydrogenation and Δ5 isomerization are closely linked, ordered reactions."

https://openalex.org/W1530264867,"Abstract Initial velocity patterns have been obtained for rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase at pH 7.4, 25°, with six nucleotides as substrates, and also with 2,5-anhydro-d-mannitol-6-P and 2,5-anhydro-d-mannitol-1,6-P2 as substrate analogs. In the forward (MgNTP, fructose-6-P) direction most of the patterns were parallel or nearly so, but with MgITP and MgCTP there was clear convergence. In the reverse direction all patterns except for MgGDP were clearly intersecting. The mechanism must therefore be sequential. The good activity of the anhydromannitol analog, but the failure of l-sorbose-6-P or 2,5-anhydro-d-glucitol-6-P prepared either chemically or enzymatically to act as a substrate suggests that the enzyme is specific both for the β anomers of fructose-6-P and fructose-P2 and for the d configuration at carbon 5. The activity of fructose-1-P (presumably the β anomer) as a substrate is consistent with this view, as is the failure of l-sorbose-1-P to act either as inhibitor or substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1947521960,"When grown in medium containing urea and nitrate, wild type Aspergillus nidulans possesses approximately 2-fold higher activities of four enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway and 3-fold higher activity of glucose phosphate isomerase than when grown in medium containing urea. The activities of one enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway and of three enzymes of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway and of NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase are either not affected, or only slightly affected, by the presence of nitrate during growth. The results obtained from mutants of the nitrate reduction pathway show that neither nitrate nor nitrite directly causes the increases in the activities of the four enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway and glucose phosphate isomerase, that the increases in these activities do not depend upon the metabolism of nitrate and probably do not result from changes in the concentrations of either NADP+ or NADPH. The results suggest that the product of the nirA gene, which is the inducer of the enzymes of the nitrate reduction pathway, is responsible for bringing about the increases in the activities of the enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway and glucose phosphate isomerase and that the state of activity of the product of the nirA gene for its stimulatory effect on the activities of the four pentose phosphate pathway enzymes and glucose phosphate isomerase is regulated in exactly the same way as is its state of activity for inducing the enzymes of the nitrate reduction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1600131516,"Abstract Quantitative measurements of aurovertin binding to submitochondrial particles confirm previous conclusions that the fluorescence responses of aurovertin formed in a complex with soluble and membrane-bound mitochondrial ATPase were a reflection of similar alterations in the two forms of the enzyme and add support to the conclusion that aurovertin functions as a reporter molecule for conformational change. The rate and magnitude of the energy-dependent fluorescence enhancement of aurovertin was strongly influenced by the composition of the reaction mixture, particularly by the presence of adenine nucleotides and Mg2+. At high concentrations of aurovertin (5 µm), addition of succinate to submitochondrial particles led to a 2-fold increase in both binding affinity and fluorescence increment without changing the number of binding sites or the amount of aurovertin bound. The fast phase of the two-phase energized fluorescence response, revealed by rapid flow studies at pH 6.6, fitted first order kinetics with a half-time in the range 34 to 47 ms. The characteristics of the energized response were identical in submitochondrial particles and in intact mitochondria. Inhibition of ATPase activity by the protein inhibitor of the enzyme was associated with partial quenching of fluorescence, masking of one of the two binding sites for aurovertin on the soluble ATPase, a 2-fold increase in the binding affinity for the probe, and a reduction of 30% in the fluorescence increment. It was concluded that dissociation of ATP and Mg2+ during the energized response reflected, at least in part, conformational changes in the ATPase which were reported by changes in aurovertin fluorescence. A procedure is presented for isolation of aurovertin."

https://openalex.org/W1639281371,"Abstract Phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) occurs in turtle heart at a specific activity of about 19 units per g wet weight; Mg2+ or Mn2+ can satisfy the divalent cation requirement; ATP, GTP, or ITP all can serve as phosphate donors for the reaction. Although the pH optimum for the enzyme is pH 7.5, the intracellular pH of the anoxic turtle heart, pH 6.8, was chosen for characterizing the enzyme. At this pH, turtle heart phosphofructokinase displays hyperbolic saturation kinetics with respect to both substrates. The Michaelis constant (Km) for fructose-6-P is 0.034 mm with Mn2+ as the divalent cation and is 0.06 mm with Mg2+ as the cation cofactor. The maximum velocity in the presence of Mn2+ is only 75% that obtained with Mg2+. In the presence of citrate, a potent inhibitor of the enzyme, fructose-6-P saturation curves become sigmoidal, but the effects of citrate on the apparent enzyme-substrate affinity and upon the maximum velocity can be reversed with adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), AMP, or ADP. High concentrations of ATP also inhibit the enzyme, 8.5 mm ATP reducing the maximum velocity by half. The effects of ATP could be reversed with cyclic AMP, AMP, ADP, and fructose-1,6-P2. Of other compounds tested, only creatine phosphate, within the expected physiological concentration range, was found to potently inhibit turtle heart phosphofructokinase. At 1 mm concentrations of creatine phosphate, substrate saturation curves become highly sigmoidal with a large reduction in enzyme-substrate affinity. All creatine phosphate effects can be reversed by fructose-1,6-P2, 3-phosphoglycerate, AMP, and cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1527625713,"Abstract Chicken liver and breast muscle phosphofructokinases have been purified to homogeneity; the liver enzyme has been crystallized. The liver phosphofructokinase is reversibly inactivated at low temperatures. This property appears to be unique to phosphofructokinases from avian livers; the enzyme from other tissues of chicken and from the livers of several other animals are stable in the cold. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation, gel filtration, and ultracentrifugal analysis reveal polymeric forms of the chicken liver enzyme, with the distribution depending upon the conditions and protein concentration. The molecular weight of the monomeric form of the liver enzyme is approximately 400,000. However, the enzyme in NaHCO3 at pH 10.5 has a molecular weight of about 210,000. In 7 m guanidine hydrochloride the enzyme dissociates into subunits of 60,000 ± 5,000 daltons. Peptide mapping and gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate suggest that these subunits are identical. Negative stain electron microscopy indicates that stable dimers and tetramers are formed by self-association of these subunits. Under appropriate conditions, the higher polymeric forms result from aggregation of the tetramers into chains or sheets."

https://openalex.org/W1562419683,"Abstract Restriction endonuclease B possesses a DNA-dependent ATPase activity. The ATP hydrolysis can continue for hours after the DNA hydrolysis has stopped and is due to a stable DNA-enzyme complex. RFI of bacteriophage f1 is much more active than its full length linear form (RFIII) in stimulating the ATP hydrolysis. Experiments with λ phage DNA sheared into various size molecules indicate that the ATPase activity is a direct function of the molecular weight of linear DNA in a range between 0.9 to 13 x 106 daltons. While sonicated, unmodified λ DNA molecules (5 x 105 daltons) fail to stimulate the ATPase activity, they do inhibit the intact DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis. The results can be interpreted as follows. (a) Endonuclease R-B recognizes DNA at the SB sites; this recognition step is independent of DNA length. (b) The probability that a linear DNA molecule is cleaved by an enzyme molecule bound to the DNA depends upon the length of the DNA: the greater the number of nucleotide pairs the higher the probability of cleavage. Circularization of a small DNA duplex also increases the probability of cleavage. One possible explanation is that the enzyme travels along the DNA molecule before cleaving the DNA. If the enzyme reaches an end of the DNA molecule before cleavage occurs, the enzyme molecule is inactivated. (c) After DNA hydrolysis has occurred, the enzyme (or one of its components) remains on the DNA molecule and causes the massive ATP hydrolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1522745147,"Abstract 1. Chemical modification of chloroplast membranes by diazonium benzenesulfonic acid (DABS) resulted in marked inhibition of noncyclic and cyclic photophosphorylation. Accompanying the inhibition of ATP synthesis there was an increased rate of basal electron flow and loss of the ability of ADP to stimulate the basal electron transport rate, both characteristic of uncoupling. 2. The calcium-dependent ATPase activity of the coupling factor was also severely inhibited after treatment with the diazonium compound. This, in conjunction with the binding of [35S]DABS to the coupling factor subunits as revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis, suggests that the inhibition of phosphorylation results, in part at least, from inactivation of the coupling factor complex by the chemical modifier. 3. Treatment of chloroplast membranes (from which coupling factor was largely removed by two EDTA washes) with [35S]DABS, followed by digitonin fractionation of the membranes into Photosystem I and Photosystem II fractions revealed that the Photosystem I fraction incorporated 10-fold more [35S]DABS than the Photosystem II fraction. This is consistent with previous findings (Dillley, R. A., Peters, G. A., and Shaw, E. R. (1972) J. Membrane Biol. 8, 163–180) using intact chloroplasts (with coupling factor present) that the intrinsic proteins associated with Photosystem I are localized at the external surface of the grana membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1968304798,"A soluble form of tryptophan-5-hydroxylase activity was found to be present in areas rich in serotonergic terminals (colliculi, hippocampus, septal area, and remaining telencephalon) as well as in brainstem, an area rich in cell bodies. The enzymatic activity in all brain regions, except the septal area, was inhibited to varying degrees following administration of parachlorophenylalanine. Destruction of the raphe nuclei in the midbrain led to a large and comparable decrease in both serotonin content and tryptophan hydroxylase activity of the hippocampus. In contrast, these lesions did not significantly affect the enzymatic activity of the septal area although the serotonin content was decreased by 72 percent. These findings suggest that the major portion of the tryptophan hydroxylase activity of the septal area is uniquely different from that found in other telencephalic areas in that it is not localized in serotonergic nerve terminals nor is it inhibited by parachlorophenylalanine."

https://openalex.org/W1594422897,"Abstract Administration of l-tryptophan to normal fed rats inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis at the level of P-enolpyruvate formation but nonetheless causes a paradoxical increase in the assayable specific activity of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase. Similar results obtain if livers isolated from normal rats are perfused with tryptophan, 3-hydroxyanthranilate or quinolinate. However, we find that no such inhibition of gluconeogenesis occurs in intact, fed, alloxan- or streptozotocin-diabetic rats following treatment with tryptophan or 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, nor is there any increase in the already elevated assayable specific activity of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase. Furthermore, perfusion of livers isolated from alloxan- or streptozotocin-diabetic rats with tryptophan, 3-hydroxyanthranilate or quinolinate does not produce a metabolite crossover between P-enolpyruvate and its precursors nor is there any significant enhancement of assayable specific activity of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase. Additionally, perfusion of diabetic livers with tryptophan or quinolinate does not inhibit the conversion of radioactive lactate to glucose although such inhibition does occur in livers from normal rats. The results suggest that tryptophan and certain of its metabolites, including quinolinate, are unable to inhibit gluconeogenesis in diabetic rats under conditions known to cause such inhibition in normal rats."
https://openalex.org/W1977347101,"The hyperthermic response of rabbits to apomorphine, a dopaminergic agonist, is abolished by prior treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine. If such 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-depleted animals are administered a peripherally acting decarboxylase inhibitor plus 5-hydroxytryptophan, central stores of 5-HT are regenerated and the hyperthermic response to apomorphine is restored in part. The effects of apomorphine in rabbits with elevated concentrations of 5-HT are not different from those in control animals. The behavioral effects of apomnorphine appear to be constant in all groups of animals tested. It is suggested that the hyperthermic effects of apomorphine in rabbits require the presence of 5-HT."

https://openalex.org/W1483426430,"Abstract Mitochondria isolated from the wild type and poky strains of Neurospora crassa are shown to contain three b-cytochromes. Two of these—b-561 and b-566 (b-558)—are reduced by physiological substrates, whereas the third (α-peak (25°) at 558 nm) is reduced only by dithionite. The concentration of all three b-cytochromes is much lower in poky than in wild type mitochondria, but the ratio of b-561 to b-566 (b-558) remains 1:1 in both strains. On the other hand, the proportion of b, measured by potentiometric titrations at wavelength pair 559–540 nm, increases from 30% in wild type to 55 to 60% in poky. The presence of the dithionite-reducible component has been overlooked by other workers leading to an apparently erroneous report that the stoichiometry of b-561 and b-566 (b-558) is 6:1 in poky mitochondria (von Jagow, G., Weiss, H., and Klingenberg, M. (1973) Eur. J. Biochem. 33, 140). The measured midpoint potentials of b-561, b-566 (b-558), and dithionite-reducible b in wild type mitochondria are 78 ± 2, -73 ± 8, and -166 ± 4 mv, respectively. Roughly the same midpoint potentials are found for the b-cytochromes of poky and the results support the idea that, except for concentration, the b-cytochromes are not significantly altered by the poky mutation."

https://openalex.org/W1569888129,"Abstract The energy source for concentrative transport of α-amino-isobutyric acid (AIB) in KB cells is ATP generated during either anaerobic glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation. The dependence of AIB accumulation on the concentration of ATP is described by a rectangular hyperbola from which the ATP concentration supporting half-maximal accumulation of AIB was estimated to be 0.8 mm. With the aid of inhibitors and uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation it was shown that energization of AIB transport by ATP does not involve the participation of high energy intermediates which may be generated within the mitochondria during oxidative phosphorylation or from ATP. Evidence was obtained against the function of phosphoenolpyruvate as the immediate energy donor to the transport system. A kinetic analysis of AIB influx and efflux revealed that ATP and intracellular K+ act on the step involved in AIB uptake by decreasing the Km for AIB influx, whereas oligomycin increases this Km. A comparison of the effectiveness of oligomycin, peliomycin, and ossamycin in inhibiting three distinct biochemical systems, namely, oxidative phosphorylation, AIB transport, and the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, showed that all three inhibitors are equally effective in inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation, but peliomycin is the most effective in inhibiting the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase. Ossamycin is the least effective in inhibiting the latter and AIB transport."
