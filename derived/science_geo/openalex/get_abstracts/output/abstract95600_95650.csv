https://openalex.org/W2060172635,"Two distinct serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptors designated serotonin 1 and serotonin 2 bind tritium-labeled serotonin and tritium-labeled spiroperidol, respectively. Drug potencies at serotonin 2 sites, but not at serotonin 1 sites, predict their effects on the ""serotonin behavioral syndrome,"" indicating that serotonin 2 sites mediate these behaviors. The limited correlation of drug effects with regulation by guanine nucleotides suggests that serotonin 1 sites might be linked to adenylate cyclase. Drug specificities of serotonin-elicited synaptic inhibition and excitation may reflect serotonin 1 and serotonin 2 receptor interactions, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2102129370,"cDNA clones complementary to liver mRNA were prepared and used to determine transcription rates of specific genes in isolated nuclei from liver, brain, and hepatoma cells. The cDNA sequences complementary to mRNA found only (or mainly) in the liver hybridize to labeled nuclear RNA only from liver nuclei. It appears that transcriptional events are primarily responsible for the synthesis of these, and perhaps most, tissue-specific moderately abundant mRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W2127453466,"We have prepared a homogeneous, soluble 8.6S species (""8.6S clathrin"") from calf-brain coated vesicles. Crosslinking experiments show that this 8.6S clathrin is composed of three heavy chains (molecular weight 180,000) and three light chains (molecular weights 33,000 and 36,000). Each heavy chain is in close contact with a single light chain, and the light chains appear not to be in contact with each other. Intact 8.6S clathrin can reassemble into cages without participation of additional protein species."
https://openalex.org/W1490909565,"The rate constants have been derived for (a) the condensation of glucose with hemoglobin to form the labile Schiff base intermediate, pre-AIc; (b) the dissociation of this complex to hemoglobin and glucose; (c) the rearrangement of this complex to form the stable ketoamine, Hb AIc. These measurements required the purification of commercially available D-[14C]glucose in order to remove a rapidly reacting contaminant. The initial condensation reaction rate (kappa'1) was measured by incubating column purified Hb A0 for up to 8 h under physiologic conditions with purified D-[14C]glucose in the presence of cyanoborohydride which traps the Schiff base and reduces it to a stable adduct. A parallel incubation utilizing Hb AIc revealed the contribution of the beta-NH2-terminal amino group (kappa 1) to the overall value for kappa'1. The reverse reaction rate (kappa -1) was determined from incubations carried ut in the absence of cyanoborohydride. The rate of the Amadori rearrangement (kappa 2) was determined from longer (6-21 days) incubations under identical conditions, followed by chromatographic isolation of Hb AIc. This value for kappa 2 agrees well with one we previously obtained from in vivo data. These experiments provide direct chemical evidence for an aldimine precursor in the nonenzymatic glycosylation of protein. Furthermore, the use of these rate constants provides a reasonable estimate of the distribution of the labile aldimine (pre-AIc) and the stable ketoamine (Hb AIc) in normal and diabetic red cells. This information is useful in the interpretation of measurements of glycosylated hemoglobin in diabetic patients."

https://openalex.org/W2139129137,"A transcription factor binds specifically to a region within the 5S ribosomal RNA gene that is known to be required for accurate initiation of transcription of the gene. We have confirmed the significance of this interaction by comparing various deletion mutants for their ability to initiate transcription and to bind the protein. Loss of specific binding of the protein occurs when the gene is deleted beyond +83 from the 3′ direction. This coincides exactly with the loss of ability to initiate transcription. In contrast, deletions entering the gene from the 5′ direction and extending beyond the 5′ border of the control region (+50/+55) give partial protection of the remainder of the control region. This observation can explain why deletions beyond the 5′ border of the control region that are unable to initiate transcription can still compete for the transcription of the wild-type 5S RNA gene."

https://openalex.org/W1484694672,"A tamoxifen-resistant variant (R27) was selected by cloning wild type MCF-7 cells. R27 has the same growth rate as MCF-7 under optimal conditions. But tamoxifen has no effect on the growth rate (growth constant of R27 under control condition, 0.071 +/- 0.007 day-1; tamoxifen-treated cells, 0.073 +/- 0.011 day-1) and minimal effects on thymidine incorporation in R27, whereas tamoxifen has a strongly suppressive effect on the growth rate and thymidine incorporation in MCF-7. The estradiol-mediated stimulation of growth in R27 is somewhat less than in MCF-7 (growth constants of R27 and MCF-7 are 0.112 +/- 0.015 and 0.125 +/- 0.009 day-1, respectively. R27 contains unoccupied receptors in both cytoplasmic and crude nuclear extract fractions with slightly higher numbers of cytosol receptors than wild type MCF-7. The same dissociation constant and the same molecular weight estimated by Sephadex chromatography and the same sucrose density behavior were observed in R27 and MCF-7. Extent of competition with estradiol and tamoxifen for cytoplasmic estrogen receptor is the same for R27 and MCF-7. Induction of progesterone receptor following treatment with estradiol is the same for R27 and MCF-7. Estrogen receptor is activated by salt and nucleotide in both MCF-7 and R27; however, the extent of activation is much higher in MCF-7 than R27."
https://openalex.org/W1606319688,"A rapidly fatal neurovisceral storage disease was discovered in both male and female offspring of clinically normal Nubian goats. Microscopic examination of fixed tissues revealed extensive demyelination and ubiquitous distribution of lysosomal storage vacuoles containing dispersed floccular material and membranous fragments. Urine was found to contain elevated levels of both mannose and N-acetylglucosamine, suggestive of an oligosaccharide storage disease. Brain was found to contain 2.2 mumol/g of a trisaccharide Man(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-4)GlcNAc; (Jones, M. Z., and Laine, R. A. (1980) Fed. Proc. 39, 2521 and Jones, M. Z., and Laine, R. A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 5181-5184). A profound deficiency of beta-D-mannosidase activity was found in a number of tissues from affected goats; obligate heterozygotes showed a partial enzyme deficiency. Other lysosomal hydrolase activities were normal or elevated over normal, including alpha-D-mannosidase, confirming that this was a hitherto undescribed inborn error of glycoprotein catabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1584835244,"We have investigated nonenzymatic glycosylation of crystallins from calf and mature bovine lenses (2-6 years old). The lens homogenates were treated with 200-fold molar excess of [3H]NaBH4 and the incorporation of radioactivity was determined. The extent of glycosylation was more precisely determined from the 6 N HCl hydrolysate of [3H]borohydride-treated proteins by analyzing the glucitol-lysine adduct on a high pressure cation exchange column. We found that the [3H]NaBH4 incorporation and the amount of glucitol-lysine detected increased with age, particularly in HM alpha crystallin, a high molecular weight aggregate which accumulates with aging. This age-related increase in nonenzymatic glycosylation was also demonstrated by a comparison of crystallins isolated from the cortex and nucleus of a single lens. Nonenzymatic glycosylation of lens crystallins exemplifies a new form of post-transitional modification of long-lived proteins in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1587250416,"Abstract Tunicamycin, which inhibits N-linked oligosaccharide chain addition to nascent polypeptides, interrupts glycosylation of the insulin receptor in 3T3-L1 adipocytes giving rise to inactive receptors. Chronic exposure of cells to low levels (100 ng/ml) of high performance liquid chromatography-purified tunicamycin causes a greater than or equal to 90% depletion of insulin binding to cell surface and Triton X-100-extractable receptors and a 93% inhibition of [3H]glucosamine incorporation into protein in alkali-stable form. Under identical conditions, protein synthesis was inhibited less than 10%. Recovery of insulin binding activity after the removal of tunicamycin achieves 70-80% of control activity within 36 h. Concomitant with the withdrawal of tunicamycin, cells were shifted to medium containing (greater than 95% 15N, 13C, 2H) amino acids after which Triton X-100-solubilized and heavy insulin receptors were separated isopycnically on CsCl density gradients. A kinetic analysis of the recovery of functional receptors revealed that the initial appearance of previously synthesized light receptor was followed, after a short lag, by newly synthesized receptor. Similar levels of light receptor, but no new receptor, accrue in the presence of cycloheximide. This strongly suggests that inactive aglycoinsulin receptor accumulated post-translationally during chronic treatment with tunicamycin and then re-entered the glycosylation pathway when the inhibitor was removed giving rise to a functional insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2047959820,"The location of the calcium-binding sites in the human acidic proline-rich proteins, salivary proteins A and C, were determined by equilibrium dialysis of the tryptic peptides with buffers containing 45Ca. All the calcium-binding sites are located in the NH2-terminal tryptic peptide (TX peptide). The nature of the calcium binding sites in the TX peptide and native salivary proteins A and C, as well as dephosphorylated proteins were compared. Two types of sites can be distinguished in peptide TX. Type I sites have an apparent dissociation constant (K) of 38 microM and are responsible for the binding of 2.6 mol of Ca/mol of peptide. The corresponding figures for Type II sites are 780 microM and 5.3 mol of Ca/mol of peptide. In the native proteins, the amount of calcium bound at the type II sites decreases to 3.9 mol of Ca/mol of proteins A and C and K increases to 1100 microM. The amount of calcium bound at type I sites decreases to 1.5 mol/mol of protein A and 0.6 mol/mol of protein C, but there is no change in K. Dephosphorylation affects the calcium binding at both types of sites. The experiments indicate that the COOH-terminal parts of the native proteins affect the number and the nature of the protein calcium-binding sites. Proton and phosphorous NMR data demonstrate that beta-COOH in aspartic acid, as well as phosphoserine, are part of the calcium-binding sites. The difference in calcium binding to salivary proteins A and C may be due at least partially to differences in the environment of one or more aspartic acids."

https://openalex.org/W1973141749,"We have obtained novel adenovirus-SV40 recombinant viruses that express wild-type SV40 large T and small t antigens under the control of different adenovirus promoters. Hybrids were constructed in vitro with SV40 DNA that contains the entire early coding region but lacks the transcriptional promoter. Recombinants were isolated by a strong biological selection for viruses that express SV40 T antigen. Analysis of several recombinant genomes indicates that they contain the SV40 A gene inserted in a variety of positions and orientations in the adenoviral genome. Moreover, the set of hybrid transcripts reveals an unexpected variety of splicing patterns. Some hybrid mRNAs transcribed from the adenovirus late promoter appear to contain the adenovirus tripartite leader sequence. Other hybrid mRNAs were transcribed from adenovirus early promoters. All recombinant mRNAs contain intact SV40 early sequences that have normal splice patterns and produce wild-type T antigens. Biochemical characterization of SV40 T antigens overproduced by the hybrid viruses indicates that they are structurally indistinguishable from wild-type SV40 large T antigen and are functionally equivalent to the D2 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2162718797,"Primary cultures of male Xenopus liver parenchymal cells that retained their competence to respond to estrogen were used to study the hormone-induced activation of the vitellogenin gene in vitro. The accumulation of vitellogenin mRNA in these cells was monitored by a quantitative diazotized paper disc hybridization procedure with a sensitivity of at least 6 pg of sequences complementary to the probe in total RNA samples of 10 μg. A short-term timecourse analysis showed that vitellogenin mRNA was detectable within 3 hr of exposure to estrogen during primary stimulation, and that the maximum rate of accumulation was reached at 5–6 hr. A longterm time-course analysis of the accumulation of vitellogenin mRNA showed that it is possible to obtain a primary response, a hormone withdrawal effect and an enhanced secondary response in the same batch of cells in a manner analogous to that observed in vivo. Measurement of hormone concentration dependence showed a response at 10−9 M estradiol, which continued to increase up to at least 10−6 M estradiol. This requirement for large doses of estradiol for maximal response can be explained by the rapid metabolism of estradiol by the cultured cells."

https://openalex.org/W1593616284,"The cholesterol content of normal human skin fibroblasts was increased (approximately doubled) by incubating cells in the presence of a high concentration of low density lipoprotein. Cholesterol efflux from these cells was then studied as a function of time and as a function of acceptor concentration. High density lipoprotein from which essentially all of the cholesterol had been removed by heptane extraction was used as a model acceptor (cholesterol-depleted high density lipoprotein). Using a sensitive enzymatic assay, it was possible to measure the increase in medium cholesterol and the decrease in cell cholesterol content simultaneously. Release was approximately a linear function of time for at least 6-12 h. A maximal rate of release was obtained at 20 micrograms of protein/ml (50% of excess stored sterol released in about 12 h); increasing the acceptor concentration 10-fold (to 200 micrograms/ml) failed to increase efflux rate. Comparison of the rates of fall of free and ester cholesterol levels suggested that hydrolysis of the ester may be rate-limiting when cholesterol-depleted high density lipoprotein is used as the acceptor. The results imply that above saturating concentrations of acceptor, acceptor-cell interaction is no longer limiting and that the rate of efflux of cholesterol under such conditions depends on intracellular processes necessary to make cholesterol available to the acceptor (e.g. hydrolysis of cholesterol esters and transfer of cholesterol from intracellular sites to the plasma membrane). Whether or not the concentrations of acceptor bathing cells in vivo is normally rate-limiting remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1580535596,"Methyl sterol oxidase of microsomal synthesis of cholesterol from lanosterol is a mixed-function oxidase that is dependent upon reduced pyridine nucleotide. The methyl sterol oxidase, as well as NADH-cytochrome c reductase, in intact rat liver microsomes are inhibited by anti-cytochrome b5 immunoglobulin, but NADPH-cytochrome c reductase is not affected. There is a decreased time lag prior to onset of reoxidation of steady state levels of reduced cytochrome b5 when 4-methyl sterol oxidase substrates are present. Trypsin treatment of microsomes destroys cytochrome b5 with loss of methyl sterol oxidase activity. Activity is restored by addition of purified cytochrome b5 to trypsin-treated microsomes. Initial attempts to solubilize and purify 4-methyl sterol oxidase have been only partially successful due to the extreme lability of the oxidase. However, DEAE-cellulose column chromatography of a detergent extract of microsomes yields a fraction that contains the oxidase, lipids, and NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase but is free of cytochrome b5. Oxidation of 4 alpha [30-3H] methyl-5 alpha-cholest-7-en-3 beta-ol by methyl sterol oxidase in this isolated fraction can be fully restored by the addition of purified liver microsomal cytochrome b5. These results strongly support the suggestion that membrane-bound cytochrome b5 of rat liver microsomes is an obligatory electron carrier from NADH to 4-methyl sterol oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W2003339149,"Developing cells of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum release a low molecular weight metabolite (Slug Turning Factor, STF) which, at high uniform concentrations, interferes with phototaxis and thermotaxis by D. discoideum slugs. D. discoideum slugs migrating in darkness are repelled by (exhibit negative chemotaxis to) crude STF exudates. Dose-response curves relating the accuracies of phototaxis and negative chemotaxis to STF concentration indicate that, in both phototaxis and chemotaxis, slugs ""measure"" the ratios of STF concentrations on their opposite sides. Net STF release is enhanced by light. We propose that light, focused onto the slug's distal side by its convex surface, generates a lateral STF gradient in response to which the slug turns toward the light source."

M. (1979) Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 5, 513). The affected kids of both sexes showed profound neurological deficits at birth, lack of myelination in cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum, axonal lesions, and cytoplasmic vacuolation. A similar genetic syndrome arose independently in a population of Anglo-Nubian goats in New South Wales (Hartley, W. J., and Blakemore, W. F. (1973) Acta Neuropathol. 25, 325-333). Preliminary chemical characterization of an accumulated metabolite was performed. An extract of 1 g of brain from an affected goat was found to contain 2.2 mumol of the trisaccharide Man (beta 1 goes to 4)GlcNAc(beta 1 goes to 4)GlcNAc (beta-mannosylchitobiose). The accumulation of this substance suggests the possibility of a genetic defect in beta-mannosidase in the catabolic pathway for N-linked complex glycopeptides and would be the first indication of a beta-mannosidosis."

https://openalex.org/W1571441132,"The intensity of scattered light at angles between 30 degrees and 120 degrees has been measured during the heat gelation lag phase of rat tail tendon collagen. As previously reported, the intensity at a scattering angle of 90 degrees does not change during the lag phase of gelation, whereas during this period, the intensity extrapolated to zero degrees more than doubles. Based on measurement of the Rayleigh factor at low angles, it is concluded that the lag phase terminates when the molecular weight is greater than 930,000 which is consistent with the formation of a linear 4D staggered trimer as previously proposed. Once lateral growth begins, the molecular weight continues to increase approximately linearly with time until a molecular weight of 4 X 10(6) (5 +/- 1 trimers) is reached, at which time the rate of increase of molecular weight increases significantly. It is concluded that a trimer with about 5 strands forms during the early phases of lateral growth and appears similar to the microfibrillar unit proposed based on x-ray diffraction modeling. Further growth occurs by linear and lateral addition of the trimeric units in a manner still under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2009621975,"The bacteriophage M13 is a 1 μm long filament consisting of a circular single-stranded DNA loop firmly held within a tubular protein capsid. We report here that exposure to a chloroform-water interface initiates a 20 fold contraction of each filament into a hollow protein sphere. In these 0.04 μm diameter particles, termed M13 “spheroids,” two thirds of the DNA is apparently extruded through a hole in the wall of the spheroid; the portion of DNA remaining inside the shell centers about the origins of M13 DNA replication. These results suggest that the filament, upon exposure to a membrane environment, undergoes an ordered change whereby the DNA is released into the cell and the coat protein is changed to a form more easily solubilized by the membrane lipids."

A model lipid system of nonionic detergent micelles was used to solubilize both substrates and products. The enantioselectivity of purified epoxide hydrolase in micellar solution was essentially the same as the microsomal enzyme in the absence of detergent. Regioselectivity of the enzyme was determined by a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric procedure in which bis-trifluoroacetates of the dihydrodiols were pyrolyzed to trifluoroacetylphenols to locate the position of the enzyme-catalyzed incorporation of 18O from H218O into the dihydrodiol. Correlation of the enantio- and regioselectivity data with the known absolute configurations of the dihydrodiols permitted the assignment of the (4S,5R) and (5S,6R) absolute configurations to (+)-benzo[a]pyrene 4,5- and (+)-benzo[a]anthracene 5,6-oxide, respectively. A kinetic analysis of the hydration of arene oxide substrates in micellar solution is presented. The kinetic discrimination of the enzyme toward substrate enantiomers and the product enantioselectivity of the enzyme are discussed in terms of possible molecular deformations occurring in the transition state and the ability of the enzyme to bind and stabilize these transition states."
https://openalex.org/W1540646599,"A new heterobifunctional photoaffinity probe, N-(4-azidobenzoylglycyl)-S-(2-thiopyridyl)-cysteine (AGTC) can be synthesized from cysteine via a coupling of the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of 4-azidobenzoylglycine to S-(2-thiopyridyl) cysteine. AGTC is readily dissolved in an aqueous buffer at pH 7.5 and is stable at room temperature in aqueous media ranging in pH from 3.0 to 9.0. No degradation is observed when AGTC in aqueous solution at pH 7.5 is exposed to laboratory fluorescent light at room temperature for 1 week. The disulfide bridge moiety of AGTC is stable to the conditions of photolysis used to activate the arylazido group for cross-linking. AGTC is incorporated (over 90% within 2 h) into such proteins as rabbit skeletal troponin C, alpha-tropomyosin, and actin through disulfide bridge formation. The degree of incorporation of AGTC into proteins can be monitored by spectrophotometric determination of the release of pyridine-2-thionine at 343 nm. This disappearance of the azido moiety of AGTC or the photoaffinity-labeled tropomyosin (AGC-tropomyosin) during photolysis can be followed by the decrease in the absorbance at 270 nm. When AGC-tropomyosin was treated with a 6 M urea, 0.1 M dithiothreitol buffer overnight, 92% of the photoaffinity probe was removed from the sulfhydryl group of tropomyosin. This reduced tropomyosin can be relabeled (over 86%) with a freshly prepared solution of AGTC, indicating the reversibility of the disulfide attachment."
https://openalex.org/W166840337,"Major labeled bands of Mr = 42,000 and 47,000 were observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of human skin fibroblast membranes incubated with choleragen and [32P]NAD. Prior incubation of intact fibroblasts with choleragen blocked specifically the subsequent in vitro labeling of these two proteins. The effect of choleragen was dependent on time, temperature, and toxin concentration. Neither the choleragen A subunit nor the B subunit nor the A1 peptide could replace the holotoxin in cell incubations. Inhibition of subsequent in vitro labeling by prior exposure of cells to choleragen was correlated with increased cellular cAMP. Incubation of fibroblasts with prostaglandin E1 and isoproterenol, which activate adenylate cyclase by different mechanisms, did not block subsequent labeling with choleragen and [32P]NAD. The results suggest that proteins of Mr = 42,000 and 47,000 may be in vivo substrates for choleragen in human fibroblasts."

It is strongly inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 2-mercaptoethanol. The products of reaction are mononucleotides and small oligonucleotides bearing a 5'-phosphomonoester group. Superhelical DNA is cleaved by the enzyme to an open circular form, then cut to form a linear molecule. Relaxed closed circular duplex DNA is resistant to cleavage. Heteroduplex relaxed circular DNA molecules containing nonhomology or damage in only one strand were constructed and tested as substrates for the enzyme. The rate of enzymatic cleavage was found to be high relative to a control when molecules containing depurinated, deaminated, or radiation damaged sites were tested. Molecules containing a single mismatched base pair were not cleaved any faster than a completely base-paired control, unless reactions were carried out under conditions likely to introduce additional structural distortions in the DNA.

https://openalex.org/W1565272326,"In order to study the regulation of sulfated glycoconjugate biosynthesis during human fetal lung development, an in vitro organ culture system was utilized. Tissue explants of human fetal lung maintained in organ culture undergo hydrocortisone-potentiated morphological differentiation. Human fetal lung tissue synthesized several classes of sulfated glycoconjugates, including sulfated glycosaminoglycans, sulfated lipids, and a class of glycoproteins containing sulfated oligosaccharide chains. These sulfated oligosaccharides were not released from the polypeptides under alkaline conditions that cleave O-glycosidically linked chains and were not degraded by a variety of chemical and enzymatic treatments which degraded sulfated glycosaminoglycans. Explants maintained in culture during a 6-day period incorporated increasing levels of 35SO4 into glycoconjugates with increases of 7-fold into heparin and heparan sulfate, 3-fold into sulfated glycoproteins, and 2-fold into sulfated lipids. In comparison, incorporation of [3H]mannose into glycoconjugates increased 4-fold, and the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA increased 2- to 3-fold during this culture period. Tissues maintained in culture in the presence of hydrocortisone (10(-7) M) showed an enhanced incorporation of 35SO4 into heparin and heparan sulfate and into sulfated glycoproteins during the culture period compared to cultures maintained in the absence of hydrocortisone. However, the levels of 35SO4 incorporated into lipids, [3H]mannose incorporated into glycoproteins, and [3H]thymidine incorporated into DNA were markedly decreased in cultures maintained in the presence of 10(-7) M hydrocortisone. Only small differences in the synthesis of chondroitin sulfates and dermatan sulfate were observed during the 6-day period that lung tissues were maintained in culture in the presence or absence of hydrocortisone. Thus, the biosynthesis of specific sulfated glycoconjugates by human fetal lung tissues is probably regulated by both developmental events and by circulating steroids."

A 1:1 complex can be formed between bovine cardiac carboxamidomethylated troponin I and rabbit skeletal troponin C. The formation of the complex is calcium dependent. It is stable to DEAE-chromatography in 6 M urea, 3 mM Ca2+ and can be dissociated on DEAE-chromatography in the presence of 6 M urea, 1 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. TnC was modified with the photoaffinity probe AGTC (N-(4-azidobenzoyl-[2-3H]glycyl)-S-(2-thiopyridyl)-cysteine) at its single cysteine residue (position 98). Photolysis of the CM (carboxamidomethylated)-TnI-AGC-TnC complex resulted in the formation of a covalently linked 1:1 complex. The isolated covalently linked complex could be treated with dithiothreitol to reduce the disulfide bond between N-(4-azidobenzoyl-[2-3H]glycyl)-cysteine (AGC) and TnC to complete the transfer of the radiolabeled AGC from cysteine 98 on TnC to CM-TnI. The CM-TnI-AGC was isolated from TnC on DEAE-chromatography in 6 M urea, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol buffer. The formation of the covalent bond between the photoaffinity probe and TnI indicates the close proximity of TnI to cysteine 98 on the TnC. These results demonstrate the general utility of the new heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent to study protein interactions."

This represents the first extensive, continuous sequence information for a histocompatibility antigen encoded by the H-2D locus and allows comparison with the recently determined amino acid sequence of the H-2Kb molecule. The amino acid sequence was obtained from the sequences of three CNBr peptides, CN-E, CN-D, and CN-B, which comprise residues 1-5, 6-52, and 53-98, respectively. The amino acid sequence of CN-E was determined directly while the sequences of CN-D and CN-B were determined by NH2-terminal sequence analyses and sequence determinations of peptides produced by thrombin, staphylococcal V8 protease, and trypsin cleavage. Alignment of the CNBr peptides was accomplished by NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the H-2Db papain fragment (CN-E to CN-D) and by analyzing peptides from a tryptic digest of the intact H-2Db molecule. Positive identification was possible for all amino acids except Asp and Asn-86 which were indirectly assigned (in italics). The sequence obtained was Gly-Pro-His-Ser-Met-Arg-Tyr-Phe-Glu-Thr-Ala-Val-Ser-Arg-Pro-Gly-Leu-Glu-Glu-Pro -Arg-Tyr-Ile-Ser-Val-Gly-Tyr-Val-Asp-Asn-Lys-Glu-Phe-Val-Arg-Phe-Asp-Ser-Asp-Ala-Glu-Asn-Pro-Arg-Tyr-Glu-Pro-Arg-Ala-Pro-Trp-Met-Glu-Gln-Glu-Gly-Pro-Glu-Tyr-T rp-Glu-Arg-Glu-Thr-Gln-Lys-Ala-Lys-Gly-Gln-Glu-Gln-Trp-Phe-Arg-Val-Ser-Leu-Arg-Asn-Leu-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Tyr-Asn-Gln-Ser-Ala-Gly-Gly-Ser-His-Thr-Leu-Gln-Gln-Met."

Binding of rabbit asialotransferrin, possessing a single biantenary glycan, was too weak to establish a complete binding curve, but the human asialotransferrins, possessing two glycan attachments, did yield binding data over a sufficiently wide range of concentrations for Scatchard plot analysis. At 22 degrees C, a quantity of plasma membrane equivalent to 1 mg of membrane protein bound comparable quantities (12.3-12.8 pmol) of the asialotransferrin types with an association constant of 1.5 X 10(6) M-1 for type 1, 1.4 X 10(7) M-1 for type 2, and 1.1 X 10(8) M-1 for type 3. At 4 degrees C, the number of binding sites and the association constants were reduced, more so for asialotransferrin types 2 and 3 than for type 1. At both temperatures, the shapes of the Scatchard plots for all three asialotransferrin types were similar: in the low range of bound asialoprotein (below 0.6-0.7 nM), each plot exhibited two to three convex peaks, tentatively identified as restricted domains of positive cooperativity; in the higher range, however, the plots were linear. The findings are consistent with the view that the binding sites involved in the binding of asialotransferrin are homogenous."

https://openalex.org/W1540038074,"Abstract Compounds with the general formula C(CH2CO--(Pro)n--R1--O--COR2)4 have been synthesized with n = 0, 1, 3, 5. The R1 alcohol group provides an active ester of the acylating function R2CO--. On reaction with a nucleophile the acyl group is attached while the major part of the reagent serves as the leaving group. Even with compounds of relatively low molecular weight the extended structures represent molecules with a substantial Stokes radius. These reagents are intended to probe the accessibility of functional groups in cell organelles, particularly membranes. Subtle differences in labeling patterns have been observed in preliminary experiments with red cell ghosts.U"
