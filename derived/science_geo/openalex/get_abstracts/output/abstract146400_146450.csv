https://openalex.org/W1493752155,"The dynamin-related GTPase Dnm1 controls mitochondrial morphology in yeast. Here we show that dnm1 mutations convert the mitochondrial compartment into a planar 'net' of interconnected tubules. We propose that this net morphology results from a defect in mitochondrial fission. Immunogold labelling localizes Dnm1 to the cytoplasmic face of constricted mitochondrial tubules that appear to be dividing and to the ends of mitochondrial tubules that appear to have recently completed division. The activity of Dnm1 is epistatic to that of Fzo1, a GTPase in the outer mitochondrial membrane that regulates mitochondrial fusion. dnm1 mutations prevent mitochondrial fragmentation in fzo1 mutant strains. These findings indicate that Dnm1 regulates mitochondrial fission, assembling on the cytoplasmic face of mitochondrial tubules at sites at which division will occur."

https://openalex.org/W1834621352,"Extracellular stimuli can induce localized actin rearrangements at the site of stimulation. To understand how this occurs, we have been studying enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), a bacterial pathogen that induces formation of an actin-rich membrane pseudopod or pedestal beneath itself upon adherence to host intestinal epithelia1. Infection ultimately results in diarrhoea, which can cause death, especially among infants in developing countries1. Here we show that pedestal formation depends on localized recruitment and activation of two host-cell factors involved in actin polymerization: the heptameric Arp2/3 complex (Arp2/3c), which nucleates polymerization2, and members of the Wiskottâ€“Aldrich syndrome (WAS) family of proteins (WASP and N-WASP)3, which bind to and activate Arp2/3c (ref. 2). Arp2/3c recruitment depends on WASP, and WASP recruitment depends on its GTPase-binding domain (GBD), suggesting involvement proximally of a Rho family GTPase. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of cellular mediators of EPEC pedestal formation and of localized recruitment of WASP and Arp2/3c as part of a signalling cascade initiated at the cell surface."
