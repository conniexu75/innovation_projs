https://openalex.org/W3155554970,"We identified an emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant by viral whole-genome sequencing of 2,172 nasal/nasopharyngeal swab samples from 44 counties in California, a state in the western United States. Named B.1.427/B.1.429 to denote its two lineages, the variant emerged in May 2020 and increased from 0% to >50% of sequenced cases from September 2020 to January 2021, showing 18.6%–24% increased transmissibility relative to wild-type circulating strains. The variant carries three mutations in the spike protein, including an L452R substitution. We found 2-fold increased B.1.427/B.1.429 viral shedding in vivo and increased L452R pseudovirus infection of cell cultures and lung organoids, albeit decreased relative to pseudoviruses carrying the N501Y mutation common to variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. Antibody neutralization assays revealed 4.0- to 6.7-fold and 2.0-fold decreases in neutralizing titers from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients, respectively. The increased prevalence of a more transmissible variant in California exhibiting decreased antibody neutralization warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3163488943,"The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is an important target in current drug development efforts for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019. Molnupiravir is a broad-spectrum antiviral that is an orally bioavailable prodrug of the nucleoside analogue β-D-N<sup>4</sup>-hydroxycytidine (NHC). Molnupiravir or NHC can increase G to A and C to U transition mutations in replicating coronaviruses. These increases in mutation frequencies can be linked to increases in antiviral effects; however, biochemical data of molnupiravir-induced mutagenesis have not been reported. Here we studied the effects of the active compound NHC 5'-triphosphate (NHC-TP) against the purified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex. The efficiency of incorporation of natural nucleotides over the efficiency of incorporation of NHC-TP into model RNA substrates followed the order GTP (12,841) > ATP (424) > UTP (171) > CTP (30), indicating that NHC-TP competes predominantly with CTP for incorporation. No significant inhibition of RNA synthesis was noted as a result of the incorporated monophosphate in the RNA primer strand. When embedded in the template strand, NHC-monophosphate supported the formation of both NHC:G and NHC:A base pairs with similar efficiencies. The extension of the NHC:G product was modestly inhibited, but higher nucleotide concentrations could overcome this blockage. In contrast, the NHC:A base pair led to the observed G to A (G:NHC:A) or C to U (C:G:NHC:A:U) mutations. Together, these biochemical data support a mechanism of action of molnupiravir that is primarily based on RNA mutagenesis mediated <i>via</i> the template strand."
https://openalex.org/W3161999894,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect. Fetal screening ultrasound provides five views of the heart that together can detect 90% of complex CHD, but in practice, sensitivity is as low as 30%. Here, using 107,823 images from 1,326 retrospective echocardiograms and screening ultrasounds from 18- to 24-week fetuses, we trained an ensemble of neural networks to identify recommended cardiac views and distinguish between normal hearts and complex CHD. We also used segmentation models to calculate standard fetal cardiothoracic measurements. In an internal test set of 4,108 fetal surveys (0.9% CHD, >4.4 million images), the model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99, 95% sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI), 84–99%), 96% specificity (95% CI, 95–97%) and 100% negative predictive value in distinguishing normal from abnormal hearts. Model sensitivity was comparable to that of clinicians and remained robust on outside-hospital and lower-quality images. The model’s decisions were based on clinically relevant features. Cardiac measurements correlated with reported measures for normal and abnormal hearts. Applied to guideline-recommended imaging, ensemble learning models could significantly improve detection of fetal CHD, a critical and global diagnostic challenge. Deep learning can facilitate identification of congenital heart disease from fetal ultrasound screening, a diagnosis that in clinical practice is often missed."
https://openalex.org/W3161508292,"Since establishment of the first embryonic stem cells (ESCs), in vitro culture of totipotent cells functionally and molecularly comparable with in vivo blastomeres with embryonic and extraembryonic developmental potential has been a challenge. Here we report that spliceosomal repression in mouse ESCs drives a pluripotent-to-totipotent state transition. Using the splicing inhibitor pladienolide B, we achieve stable in vitro culture of totipotent ESCs comparable at molecular levels with 2- and 4-cell blastomeres, which we call totipotent blastomere-like cells (TBLCs). Mouse chimeric assays combined with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) demonstrate that TBLCs have a robust bidirectional developmental capability to generate multiple embryonic and extraembryonic cell lineages. Mechanically, spliceosomal repression causes widespread splicing inhibition of pluripotent genes, whereas totipotent genes, which contain few short introns, are efficiently spliced and transcriptionally activated. Our study provides a means for capturing and maintaining totipotent stem cells."

https://openalex.org/W3162740984,"Electroencephalography (EEG) microstate analysis is a method wherein spontaneous EEG activity is segmented at sub-second levels to analyze quasi-stable states. In particular, four archetype microstates and their features are known to reflect changes in brain state in neuropsychiatric diseases. However, previous studies have only reported differences in each microstate feature and have not determined whether microstate features are suitable for schizophrenia classification. Therefore, it is necessary to validate microstate features for schizophrenia classification. Nineteen microstate features, including duration, occurrence, and coverage as well as thirty-one conventional EEG features, including statistical, frequency, and temporal characteristics were obtained from resting-state EEG recordings of 14 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and from 14 healthy (control) subjects. Machine-learning based multivariate analysis was used to evaluate classification performance. EEG recordings of patients and controls showed different microstate features. More importantly, when differentiating among patients and controls, EEG microstate features outperformed conventional EEG ones. The performance of the microstate features exceeded that of conventional EEG, even after optimization using recursive feature elimination. EEG microstate features applied with conventional EEG features also showed better classification performance than conventional EEG features alone. The current study is the first to validate the use of microstate features to discriminate schizophrenia, suggesting that EEG microstate features are useful for schizophrenia classification."
https://openalex.org/W3163212147,"Expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat GGGGCC (G4C2) in the intron of the C9ORF72 gene is the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (C9-ALS/FTD). Transcripts carrying G4C2 repeat expansions generate neurotoxic dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins, including poly-Gly-Ala (poly-GA), which tends to form protein aggregates. Here, we demonstrate that UBQLN2, another ALS/FTD risk factor, is recruited to reduce poly-GA aggregates and alleviate poly-GA-induced neurotoxicity. UBQLN2 could recognize HSP70 ubiquitination, which facilitates the UBQLN2-HSP70-GA complex formation and promotes poly-GA degradation. ALS/FTD-related UBQLN2 mutants fail to bind HSP70 and clear poly-GA aggregates. Disruption of the interaction between UBQLN2 and HSP70 inhibits poly-GA aggregation in C9-ALS/FTD iPSC-derived neurons. Finally, enhancing HSP70 by the chemical compound 17AAG at the adult stage mitigates behavioral defects in poly-GA animals. Our findings suggest a critical role of the UBQLN2-HSP70 axis in protein aggregate clearance in C9-ALS/FTD."
https://openalex.org/W3160233334,"Abstract 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) but is hampered by chemoresistance. Despite its impact on patient survival, the mechanism underlying chemoresistance against 5-FU remains poorly understood. Here, we identified serine hydroxymethyltransferase-2 (SHMT2) as a critical regulator of 5-FU chemoresistance in CRC. SHMT2 inhibits autophagy by binding cytosolic p53 instead of metabolism. SHMT2 prevents cytosolic p53 degradation by inhibiting the binding of p53 and HDM2. Under 5-FU treatment, SHMT2 depletion promotes autophagy and inhibits apoptosis. Autophagy inhibitors decrease low SHMT2-induced 5-FU resistance in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the lethality of 5-FU treatment to CRC cells was enhanced by treatment with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine in patient-derived and CRC cell xenograft models. Taken together, our findings indicate that autophagy induced by low SHMT2 levels mediates 5-FU resistance in CRC. These results reveal the SHMT2–p53 interaction as a novel therapeutic target and provide a potential opportunity to reduce chemoresistance."
https://openalex.org/W3119242720,"In India, nursing regulation is generally weak, midwifery coexists with nursing, and 88% of nursing and midwifery education is provided by the private health sector. The Indian health system faces major challenges for health care provision due to poor quality, indeterminate regulatory functions and lack of reforms.We undertook a qualitative investigation to understand midwifery and nursing education, and regulatory systems in India, through a review of the regulatory Acts, and an investigation of the perceptions and experiences of senior midwifery and nursing leaders representing administration, advocacy, education, regulation, research and service provision in India with an international perspective.There is a lack of importance accorded to midwifery roles within the nursing system. The councils and Acts do not adequately reflect midwifery practice, and remain a barrier to good quality care provision. The lack of required amendment of Acts, lack of representation of midwives and nurses in key governance positions in councils and committees have restrained and undermined leadership positions, which have also impaired the growth of the professions. A lack of opportunities for professional practice and unfair assessment practices are critical concerns affecting the quality of nursing and midwifery education in private institutions across India. Midwifery and nursing students are generally more vulnerable to discrimination and have less opportunities compared to medical students exacerbated by the gender-based challenges.India is on the verge of a major regulatory reform with the National Nursing and Midwifery Commission Bill, 2020 being drafted, which makes this study a crucial and timely contribution. Our findings present the challenges that need to be addressed with regulatory reforms to enable opportunities for direct-entry into the midwifery profession, improving nursing education and practice by empowering midwives and nurses with decision-making powers for nursing and midwifery workforce governance."
https://openalex.org/W3160984339,"To report a modelling study using local health care costs and epidemiological inputs from a population-based program to access the cost-effectiveness of adopting hrHPV test.A cost-effectiveness analysis based on a microsimulation dynamic Markov model. Data and costs were based on data from the local setting and literature review. The setting was Indaiatuba, Brazil, that has adopted the hrHPV test in place of cytology since 2017. After calibrating the model, one million women were simulated in hypothetical cohorts. Three strategies were tested: cytology to women aged 25 to 64 every three years; hrHPV test to women 25-64 every five years; cytology to women 25-29 years every three years and hrHPV test to women 30-64 every five years (hybrid strategy). Outcomes were Quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER).The hrHPV testing and the hybrid strategy were the dominant strategies. Costs were lower and provided a more effective option at a negative incremental ratio of US$ 37.87 for the hybrid strategy, and negative US$ 6.16 for the HPV strategy per QALY gained. Reduction on treatment costs would influence a decrease in ICER, and an increase in the costs of the hrHPV test would increase ICER.Using population-based data, the switch from cytology to hrHPV testing in the cervical cancer screening program of Indaiatuba is less costly and cost-effective than the old cytology program."

Nowadays, digital contact tracing has promptly emerged as an indispensable asset in the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The work at hand offers a meticulous study of all the official Android contact tracing apps deployed hitherto by European countries. Each app is closely scrutinized both statically and dynamically by means of dynamic instrumentation. Depending on the level of examination, static analysis results are grouped in two axes. The first encompasses permissions, API calls, and possible connections to external URLs, while the second concentrates on potential security weaknesses and vulnerabilities, including the use of trackers, in-depth manifest analysis, shared software analysis, and taint analysis. Dynamic analysis on the other hand collects data pertaining to Java classes and network traffic. The results demonstrate that while overall these apps are well-engineered, they are not free of weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations that may ultimately put the user security and privacy at risk."
https://openalex.org/W3160694359,"The adhesion G protein–coupled receptor CD97 and its ligand complement decay-accelerating factor CD55 are important binding partners in the human immune system. Dysfunction in this binding has been linked to immune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as various cancers. Previous literatures have indicated that the CD97 includes 3 to 5 epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains at its N terminus and these EGF domains can bind to the N-terminal short consensus repeat (SCR) domains of CD55. However, the details of this interaction remain elusive, especially why the CD55 binds with the highest affinity to the shortest isoform of CD97 (EGF1,2,5). Herein, we designed a chimeric expression construct with the EGF1,2,5 domains of CD97 and the SCR1–4 domains of CD55 connected by a flexible linker and determined the complex structure by crystallography. Our data reveal that the two proteins adopt an overall antiparallel binding mode involving the SCR1–3 domains of CD55 and all three EGF domains of CD97. Mutagenesis data confirmed the importance of EGF5 in the interaction and explained the binding specificity between CD55 and CD97. The architecture of CD55–CD97 binding mode together with kinetics suggests a force-resisting shearing stretch geometry when forces applied to the C termini of both proteins in the circulating environment. The potential of the CD55–CD97 complex to withstand tensile force may provide a basis for the mechanosensing mechanism for activation of adhesion G protein–coupled receptors.

The potential of the CD55–CD97 complex to withstand tensile force may provide a basis for the mechanosensing mechanism for activation of adhesion G protein–coupled receptors. Adhesion G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a subfamily of GPCRs that participate in a wide variety of functions from cell adhesion to immune defense and development, and, consequently, their dysfunction is linked to a myriad of negative health effects including inflammation, neurological disease, and cancer (1Langenhan T. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors-candidate metabotropic mechanosensors and novel drug targets.Basic Clin. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2020; 126 Suppl 6: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Adhesion GPCRs are characterized by variable tandem adhesion domains followed by a common GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain at the extracellular region and a canonical seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain at the C-terminal region (2Langenhan T. Aust G. Hamann J. Sticky signaling--adhesion class G protein-coupled receptors take the stage.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6re3Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The epidermal growth factor (EGF) subgroup of the adhesion GPCR includes five members, CD97, and EGF module–containing mucin-like hormone receptor (EMR) numbers 1 through 4. Each of these members exhibits similar structural patterns but with variant numbers of EGF-like domains. Uniquely among the members, CD97 is widely expressed on granulocytes, monocytes, macrophage, dendritic cells, and smooth muscle cells (3Jaspars L.H. Vos W. Aust G. Van Lier R.A. Hamann J.

Recent in vivo studies using mAbs have indicated that CD97 plays a prominent role in neutrophil migration and antibacterial immunity (4Leemans J.C. te Velde A.A. Florquin S.

CD97 has three alternative gene-spliced isoforms containing between three and five EGF domains: EGF1,2,5, EGF1,2,3,5, and EGF1–5 (8Gray J.X. Haino M. Roth M.J. Maguire J.E. Jensen P.N. Yarme A.

These isoforms have been linked to distinct functions, an aspect believed to derive from the different ligands they accommodate (9Liu D. Trojanowicz B. Ye L. Li C. Zhang L. Li X. Li G. Zheng Y.

In addition to CD55, CD97 can also bind to a number of other ligands including CD90 (Thy1) (14Wandel E. Saalbach A. Sittig D. Gebhardt C. Aust G.

These varied binding partners, together with the different isoforms of CD97, likely associate with distinct physiological consequences. CD55 is a GPI-linked membrane protein with four short consensus repeat (SCR) domains at the N terminus. CD55 regulates the complement cascade by inactivating the C3 convertases and plays a critical role in inflammation and pathogen defense (17Lublin D.M. Atkinson J.P.

CD55 is also linked to adaptive immunity via costimulating CD4+ T cells with CD97, resulting in T cell activation and an increase in cell proliferation and cytokine secretion (20Capasso M.

CD97 shares the highest similarity with EMR2 in the primary sequence, with only three residual differences in EGF domains 1, 2, and 5. However, EMR2 (EGF1,2,5) has been found to bind to CD55 with a dissociation constant (KD) much lower (>10 fold) than that of CD97 (EGF1,2,5) (13Lin H.H. Stacey M. Saxby C. Knott V. Chaudhry Y.

However, owing to the absence of crystal structure for CD55 in complex with CD97 or EMR2, insights into the binding mode and specificity, as well as the signal transduction mediated by the ligand-receptor pair, remain elusive. Herein, we report the structure of the adhesive domains of the CD97–CD55 complex as determined at 3.19 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography. Evaluation of the complex structure reveals not just an overall antiparallel binding mode but also the specificity for CD97 recognition by CD55. The CD55 SCR1–4 domains and CD97 EGF1,2,5 domains were initially purified independently from HEK293 cells. However, the mixture of the two fragments did not yield a stable complex in gel-filtration chromatography, presumably because of the relatively low affinity between the two proteins. Therefore, we designed a 24-residue linker including a tobacco etch virus protease (TEV) site to connect the C terminus of EGF1,2,5 and the N terminus of SCR1–4, enlightened by a head-to-tail docking mode based on NMR titration (Experimental procedures, Fig. 1A) (13Lin H.H.

Cleavage of the linker with TEV generated a size-exclusion profile of two peaks corresponding to the CD55 and CD97 fragments, suggesting each protein within the chimera construct was well folded individually (Fig. 1C). The small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements and alignments with models of the chimera complex and each individual protein indicated the formation of a stable CD55–CD97 complex, mediated by the flexible linker (Fig. 1D, Fig. S1 and Table S1). We then successfully crystallized the chimeric complex and collected the data to 3.19 Å resolution. We solved the structure with molecular replacement using previous high-resolution structures of CD55 and EMR2 as searching models, and the final structure was refined to Rwork and Rfree of 0.26 and 0.30, respectively (Table 1).Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsCD97–CD55 complexData collection Space groupP21 Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)51.80, 44.25, 116.53α, β, γ (°)90, 98.69, 90 Resolution (Å)aValues for the highest resolution shells are given in parentheses.33.23–3.19 (3.27–3.19) Reflections (total/unique)33,704/8903 RmergebRmerge = ∑hkl∑i|Ii(hkl) − <I(hkl)>|/∑hkl∑i|Ii(hkl), where Ii (hkl) and <I(hkl)> are the i and mean measurement of intensity of reflection hkl, respectively.0.14 (0.77) CC1/2cCC1/2 = Pearson’s correlation coefficient between average intensities of random half data sets for each unique reflection.0.98 (0.89) I/σ(I)7.3 (2.2) Completeness (%)99.2 (98.3) Redundancy3.8 (4.0)Refinement Rwork/Rfree0.267/0.304 R.m.s.d.Bond lengths (Å)0.004Bond angles (°)0.899 Ramachandran (%) plot (%)93.5/6.5/0 Residue rangeA/CD97/25–164; B/CD55/35–284 Carbohydrate residues4 Metal ion2 calcium PDB ID7DO4a Values for the highest resolution shells are given in parentheses.b Rmerge = ∑hkl∑i|Ii(hkl) − <I(hkl)>|/∑hkl∑i|Ii(hkl), where Ii (hkl) and <I(hkl)> are the i and mean measurement of intensity of reflection hkl, respectively.c CC1/2 = Pearson’s correlation coefficient between average intensities of random half data sets for each unique reflection. Open table in a new tab Although most of the residues in the complex can be successfully modeled, the linker region is disordered, consistent with its highly hydrophilic property. Crystal packing revealed two major crystal lattices with packing interfaces of 960 Å2 and 748 Å2, named lattice A and lattice B, respectively (Fig. S2A). Previous binding studies of CD55 and CD97 have emphasized the importance of the N-terminal domains of both proteins in recognition, and our designed 24-residue linker was sufficient to connect the 36 Å distance between the C terminus of EGF1,2,5 and the N terminus of SCR1–4 in lattice A but not long enough to fill the 106 Å gap in lattice B. Furthermore, lattice A binding mode can be fitted into a SAXS envelop with a normalized structural difference of 2.74; this is relatively better than the fittings of lattice B and the previously proposed model from NMR titration (Fig. S2B) (23Abbott R.J. Spendlove I. Roversi P. Fitzgibbon H. Knott V. Teriete P. McDonnell J.M. Handford P.A. Lea S.M.

Chem. 2007; 282: 22023-22032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In considering of the low-resolution envelope calculated from scattering data, we cannot rule out another possibility of an ensemble fit (24Tria G. Mertens H.D.T. Kachala M. Svergun D.I. Advanced ensemble modelling of flexible macromolecules using X-ray solution scattering.IUCrJ. 2015; 2: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) for the chimeric complex in the solution. Therefore, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding studies have been conducted to further support the lattice A binding mode (see below). All these analyses clearly favor physiological relevance of the binding mode in lattice A over lattice B and we therefore only discuss the lattice A binding mode hereafter. The CD55 and CD97 bind roughly antiparallel to each other involving each N-terminal tandem domains (Fig. 1E). Structures of CD55 and CD97 in the complex superimposed closely with prior monomeric structures, with a Cα r.m.s.d. of 0.9 to 2.1 Å and 1.1 to 1.2, respectively (Fig. 1E), suggesting no conformational change is needed during binding. Previous structures of CD55 SCR domains have suggested a constant interface of SCR2–SCR3 and very little variation in the interfaces of SCR1–SCR2 and SCR3–SCR4. In our complex structure, the orientation of SCR2–SCR3 is invariant and the other interfaces are within similar ranges of variation as the CD55 molecules of previous studies (Fig. 1E). Similar case in CD97, only slight variation in the EGF1–EGF2 or EGF2–EGF5 interface, is monitored when compared with previous monomeric structures of its homolog protein, EMR2 (Fig. 1E). In CD97 or EMR2, EGF2 and EGF5 each bind a calcium ion in the N-terminal tip, which contributes to rigidity within the interface of EGF1–EGF2 or EGF2–EGF5. These comparisons, together with apparent disorder of the 24-residue linker between the two molecules, indicated the binding mode between CD55 and CD97 is not affected by the protein engineering. The total solvent-accessible surface buried by the EGF1,2,5–SCR1–4 interactions was 1920 Å2, an interface area that is above the average for protein–protein interaction (25Chen J. Sawyer N. Regan L. Protein-protein interactions: General trends in the relationship between binding affinity and interfacial buried surface area.Protein Sci. 2013; 22: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). All domains, except SCR4, are involved in the CD97–CD55 interaction, and this is the probable reason that SCR4 possesses relatively poor electronic density compared with other domains in the complex. Our examination of the SCR4 domain revealed that only 20% of its surface area are buried by lattice contact, in contrast to 30% to 39% for the other SCR domains. Our complex structure reveals two N-glycosylation sites in CD97 (Asn-38 and Asn-108) and one N-glycosylation site in CD55 (Asn-95), but none of these carbohydrates are involved in the CD97–CD55 interactions. The EGF1,2,5–SCR1–4 interactions can be divided into three interfaces: the EGF1–SCR2/SCR3 interface, the EGF2–SCR1/SCR2 interface, and the EGF5–SCR1 interface (Fig. 2). In the EGF1–SCR2/SCR3 interface, we observed that Asp-63 of EGF1 forms a charged hydrogen bond with Arg-130 of SCR2 (Fig. 2A). In addition, EGF1 also forms extensive hydrophobic interactions with SCR2 and SCR3 residues and buries a total surface area of 518 Å2. The preeminent interactions of CD97–CD55 come from the EGF2–SCR1/SCR2 interface in the middle region, which buries a total surface area of 1278 Å2 and contains six pairs of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2B). At the upper half of this interface, Thr-70 and Glu-86 of EGF2 hydrogen bond to Glu-99 and Gln-111 of SCR2, respectively. In addition, the carbonyl group of Cys-82 in EGF2 forms a hydrogen bond to Asn-117 of SCR2. At the bottom half of the interface, the EGF2–SCR1 interactions are secured by three pairs of side chain–main chain hydrogen bonds between EGF2 residues Asp-79, Asp-80, and Asp-81 and SCR1 residues Asp-77, Lys-71, and Lys-74, respectively. In the third interface of EGF5–SCR1 (Fig. 2C), Val-137 of EGF5 inserts into a joint hydrophobic pocket formed by SCR1 residues Val-60, Lys-76, Val-79, Ile-80, and Leu-82 and EGF2 residue Phe-79. These interfaces are consistent with previous literature, identifying the EGF1,2 and SCR1,2 domains as critical determinants for CD55–CD97 interactions. Moreover, our structure unveils additional interactions contributed by EGF5 of CD97 as well as SCR3 of CD55. Notably, the involvement of EGF5 in the CD55–CD97 interactions may elucidate why the EGF1,2,5 isoform of CD97 shows a higher binding affinity to CD55 than the other two isoforms, EGF1,2,3,5 and EGF1–5. The relatively large interface in the CD55–CD97 complex appears to be inconsistent with the previously characterized low affinity and rapid off-rate binding (13Lin H.H. Stacey M. Saxby C. Knott V.

Protein-protein interactions: General trends in the relationship between binding affinity and interfacial buried surface area.Protein Sci. 2013; 22: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To understand this puzzle, we remeasured the binding kinetics of CD55 and CD97 by SPR. We preimmobilized His-tagged CD55 onto a nickel coated NTA sensor chip and sequentially injected serial concentrations of CD97 samples. Our results show that CD97 binds to CD55 with a KD of 3.2 μM, ∼20-fold higher than the previously reported affinity (Fig. 3A), and in accord with one study demonstrating a statistical correlation between the interface area and binding affinity (25Chen J. Sawyer N. Regan L. Protein-protein interactions: General trends in the relationship between binding affinity and interfacial buried surface area.Protein Sci. 2013; 22: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, compared with the previously determined fast off-rate (13Lin H.H. Stacey M. Saxby C. Knott V. Chaudhry Y. Evans D. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Handford P. Lea S. Molecular analysis of the epidermal growth factor-like short consensus repeat domain-mediated protein-protein interactions: Dissection of the CD97-CD55 complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24160-24169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), our measurements show the two proteins bound to each other with a much slower on-rate (546 M−1S−1) and off-rate (1.73 × 10−3S−1). These rates are in line with our structural observation of the antiparallel binding interface that composed by tandem rod-like domains at both sides. The apparent difference in binding kinetics between our measurements and previous reports could be attributed to the differing immobilization techniques. In the previous work, CD55 was randomly covalently attached to the chip via primary amino groups, which may cause a decrease in flexibility and accessibility by CD97 (13Lin H.H. Stacey M. Saxby C. Knott V. Chaudhry Y. Evans D. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Handford P. Lea S.

Moreover, our proteins were both expressed and secreted from HEK293 cells, whereas in the previous work, the CD97 and CD55 proteins were expressed from Escherichia coli or Pichia (13Lin H.H. Stacey M. Saxby C. Knott V. Chaudhry Y. Evans D. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Handford P. Lea S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24160-24169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We further measured affinity of CD97 mutants to confirm the physiological relevance of the binding mode. Within the interface, D63, D81, and E86 of CD97 each hydrogen bonds to a residue in CD55 (Fig. 2). Aligned with this interface, the binding affinity of mutants D63L (85.17 ± 2.43 μM), D81A (66.37 ± 21.38 μM), and E86A (17.56 ± 2.04 μM) decreased by 26-, 20-, and 5-fold, respectively (Fig. 3, B–D). The CD55–CD97 interface defined in our structure does not overlap with the interface proposed from NMR titration (23Abbott R.J. Spendlove I. Roversi P. Fitzgibbon H. Knott V. Teriete P. McDonnell J.M. Handford P.A. Lea S.M. Structural and functional characterization of a novel T cell receptor co-regulatory protein complex, CD97-CD55.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22023-22032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the previous model, the SCR1 and N-terminal portion of SCR2 in CD55 bind to the other side of CD97 with a much smaller interface (Fig. S3). Furthermore, that model does not explain how such a minute difference between CD97 and EMR2 could dramatically alter the ligand-binding affinity. It also cannot explain why the smallest isoform of CD97 has the highest binding affinity with CD55. In a further demonstration that the previous model is untenable, it locates all three carbohydrates in the binding interface (Fig. S3); the protein samples used for the NMR titration are nonglycosylated as they were generated from E. coli. In contrast, our crystal structure reveals key features that illuminate the specificities for CD55 recognition by different splicing isoforms of CD97 as well as its homologues. Although the interface involved by EGF5 (194 Å2) is relatively small—and no hydrogen bond is visualized within this interface—this EGF domain may dictate the binding affinity and specificity of the different CD97 isoforms with CD55. In the EGF1,2,3,5 and EGF1–5 isoforms, the EGF3 domain occupies the position of EGF5 and faces the SCR1 domain of CD55. The key EGF5 residue Val-137 is equivalent to a leucine residue in the EGF3 domain. The relative conservation of this position suggests that in the other two isoforms, the EGF3 domain may involve in the binding of CD55 with similar pattern. To further verify the importance of a hydrophobic aliphatic residue in the interface with CD55, we mutated the V137 to an alanine in the EGF1,2,5 fragment and the SPR result showed that the V137A mutant shows an ∼8-fold reduction in binding value (25.3 ± 2.35 μM), confirming the involvement of EGF5 in the binding interface with CD55 (Fig. 3E). The additional methylene group in the EGF3 domain, together with a potential fine-tuning of its orientation compared with the first two EGF domains, may contribute to lower binding affinity of the two longer isoforms (EGF1,2,3,5 and EGF1–5) than the EGF1,2,5 isoform. The EGF1,2,5 fragment of CD97 and EMR2 is differentiated by only three residues, and previous reference suggested >10-fold lower CD55-binding affinity of EMR2 than CD97 (13Lin H.H. Stacey M. Saxby C. Knott V. Chaudhry Y. Evans D. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Handford P. Lea S. Molecular analysis of the epidermal growth factor-like short consensus repeat domain-mediated protein-protein interactions: Dissection of the CD97-CD55 complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24160-24169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although with different values, our measurements of EMR2 EGF1,2,5 fragment indicated similar level of reduction in binding affinity (43.04 ± 6.28 μM), confirming the involvement of these variant residues in the binding interactions (Fig. 3F). Two of three variant residues are located in the binding interface with CD55, and their side chains can be unambiguously modeled in the CD97–CD55 complex (Fig. 4). The first variation is located in the EGF1–SCR2/SCR3 interface, where Thr-59 (equivalent to Met-62 in EMR2) of the CD97 EGF1 domain encounters the residues Tyr-133, Lys-160, and Phe-182 of CD55. The hydroxyl group of Thr-59 is only ∼4 Å away from Tyr-133 and Lys-160, and this forms a weak polar interaction in the CD97–CD55 interface, whereas similar interaction would be absent in the EMR2–CD55 interface (Fig. 4, A and B"

https://openalex.org/W3161257698,"The KdpDE two-component system regulates potassium homeostasis and virulence in various bacterial species. The KdpD histidine kinases (HK) of this system contain a universal stress protein (USP) domain which binds to the second messenger cyclic-di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) for regulating transcriptional output from this two-component system in Firmicutes such as Staphylococcus aureus. However, the structural basis of c-di-AMP specificity within the KdpD-USP domain is not well understood. Here, we resolved a 2.3 Å crystal structure of the S. aureus KdpD-USP domain (USPSa) complexed with c-di-AMP. Binding affinity analyses of USPSa mutants targeting the observed USPSa:c-di-AMP structural interface enabled the identification of the sequence residues that are required for c-di-AMP specificity. Based on the conservation of these residues in other Firmicutes, we identified the binding motif, (A/G/C)XSXSX2N(Y/F), which allowed us to predict c-di-AMP binding in other KdpD HKs. Furthermore, we found that the USPSa domain contains structural features distinct from the canonical standalone USPs that bind ATP as a preferred ligand. These features include inward-facing conformations of its β1-α1 and β4-α4 loops, a short α2 helix, the absence of a triphosphate-binding Walker A motif, and a unique dual phospho-ligand binding mode.

Two-component systems (TCSs) are the other prevalent signaling systems in bacteria that sense and adaptively respond to environmental cues, utilizing mechanisms distinct from the second messenger systems (29Zschiedrich C.P.

In a prototypical TCS, an environmental signal is sensed by an extracellular domain of a membrane-bound histidine kinase (HK), which triggers its autophosphorylation. The HK then transfers the phosphoryl group to a response regulator protein, which then causes an intracellular response by altering gene expression (29Zschiedrich C.P. Keidel V. Szurmant H.

The KdpD HKs of this TCS are prototypical among membrane-anchored HKs that contain an N-terminal sensory cytoplasmic region (NTR) in addition to a canonical transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic C-terminal region. The C-terminal region contains a transmitter GAF domain and an EnvZ-like catalytic HK domain. The NTR is composed of KdpD' and universal stress protein (USP) domains (Fig. 1A) (38Schramke H.

The mechanisms regulating transcriptional output from the KdpDE system have been well-studied in proteobacteria (34Heermann R. Jung K.

For example, the canonical transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain in KdpDEc sense the external and internal K+ concentrations, respectively (38Schramke H. Tostevin F. Heermann R.

Furthermore, the site of c-di-AMP binding in KdpDSa was found to be the USP domain in its NTR (hereafter referred to as USPSa) (56Moscoso J.A. Schramke H. Zhang Y. Tosi T. Dehbi A. Jung K.

Here, we performed a structural and biochemical analysis of c-di-AMP-USPSa interactions, and we identified key c-di-AMP-binding residues in KdpDFirmicutes. Our studies identified a unique nucleotide-binding mode in USPSa, intermediate between USPFG and other nucleotide-binding proteins. Our initial attempts to express N-terminally hexahistidine (His6)-tagged USPSa in E. coli yielded an insoluble protein. Because the NTR of KdpDEc had previously been shown to scaffold KdpD, KdpE, and DNA (40Heermann R. Altendorf K. Jung K.

Indeed, co-expression of the S. aureus kdpE gene (accession number SAR2167) with uspSa in E. coli produced soluble preparations of His6-tagged USPSa, as well as untagged USPSa (Fig. 1B). To determine the binding affinity and specificity of this purified His6-USPSa protein toward c-di-AMP, we monitored the ligand-induced fluorescence change using MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST). In this assay, His6-USPSa bound to c-di-AMP with a dissociation constant (KD) of 0.5 ± 0.06 μM (Table S1), which is consistent with a previously reported KD of 2 ± 0.18 μM using a maltose-binding protein–tagged USP in a differential radial capillary action of ligand assay (56Moscoso J.A.

https://openalex.org/W3161929640,"Despite the positive health effect of physical activity, one third of the world's population is estimated to be insufficiently active. Prior research has mainly investigated physical activity on an aggregate level over short periods of time, e.g., during 3 to 7 days at baseline and a few months later, post-intervention. To develop effective interventions, we need a better understanding of the temporal dynamics of physical activity. We proposed here an approach to studying walking behavior at ""high-resolution"" and by capturing the idiographic and day-to-day changes in walking behavior. We analyzed daily step count among 151 young adults with overweight or obesity who had worn an accelerometer for an average of 226 days (~25,000 observations). We then used a recursive partitioning algorithm to characterize patterns of change, here sudden behavioral gains and losses, over the course of the study. These behavioral gains or losses were defined as a 30% increase or reduction in steps relative to each participants' median level of steps lasting at least 7 days. After the identification of gains and losses, fluctuation intensity in steps from each participant's individual time series was computed with a dynamic complexity algorithm to identify potential early warning signals of sudden gains or losses. Results revealed that walking behavior change exhibits discontinuous changes that can be described as sudden gains and losses. On average, participants experienced six sudden gains or losses over the study. We also observed a significant and positive association between critical fluctuations in walking behavior, a form of early warning signals, and the subsequent occurrence of sudden behavioral losses in the next days. Altogether, this study suggests that walking behavior could be well understood under a dynamic paradigm. Results also provide support for the development of ""just-in-time adaptive"" behavioral interventions based on the detection of early warning signals for sudden behavioral losses."

Recently, the dynamic needle tip positioning (DNTP) technique was introduced to facilitate ultrasound-guided vascular catheterization. Therefore, we performed this prospective, parallel group, randomized, controlled trial to compare the ultrasound-guided DNTP technique with the palpation method in elderly patients.For this study, 256 patients aged 65 years or older were randomly allocated to the ultrasound-guided DNTP technique group (DNTP group) or the palpation method group (palpation group). The primary outcome was first-attempt success rate. The secondary outcomes were overall success rate, numbers of attempts and redirections, cannulation time, and incidence of complications.The first-attempt success rate (85.9% vs. 72.3%; relative risk [RR], 1.47; 95% CI 1.25-1.72; P<0.001) and the overall success rate (99.2% vs. 93.0%; RR, 1.07; 95% CI 1.02-1.12; P = 0.01) were significantly higher in the DNTP group compared to the palpation group. The numbers of attempts [1 (1,1) vs. 1 (1,3), P<0.001] and redirections [0 (0,1) vs. 2 (0,4), P<0.001] were significantly lower in the DNTP group. The cannulation time for successful attempts was 42 (32,55) seconds in the DNTP group and 53 (36,78) seconds in the palpation group (P<0.001). The incidence of hematoma was significantly lower in the DNTP group (7% vs. 24.2%; RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.14-0.59; P<0.001).Ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulation with the DNTP technique improved the efficiency of radial artery cannulation in elderly patients by increasing the success rate while minimizing complications."
https://openalex.org/W3161516272,"Background The literature regarding esophageal fistula after definitive concurrent chemotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains lacking. We aimed to investigate the risk factors of esophageal fistula among ESCC patients undergoing definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) via IMRT technique. Methods A total of 129 consecutive ESCC patients receiving definitive CCRT with IMRT between 2008 and 2018 were reviewed. The cumulative incidence of esophageal fistula and survival of patients were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method and compared between groups by the log-rank test. The risk factors of esophageal fistula were determined with multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results Median follow-up was 14.9 months (IQR, 7.0–28.8). Esophageal perforation was identified in 20 (15.5%) patients, resulting in esophago-pleural fistula in nine, esophago-tracheal fistula in seven, broncho-esophageal fistula in two, and aorto-esophageal fistula in two patients. The median interval from IMRT to the occurrence of esophageal fistula was 4.4 months (IQR, 3.3–10.1). Patients with esophageal fistula had an inferior median overall survival (10.0 vs. 17.2 months, p = 0.0096). T4 (HR, 3.776; 95% CI, 1.383–10.308; p = 0.010) and esophageal stenosis (HR, 2.601; 95% CI, 1.053–6.428; p = 0.038) at baseline were the independent risk factors for esophageal fistula. The cumulative incidence of esophageal fistula was higher in patients with T4 (p = 0.018) and pre-treatment esophageal stenosis (p = 0.045). There was a trend toward better survival after esophageal fistula among patients receiving repair or stenting for the fistula than those only undergoing conservative treatments (median survival, 5.9 vs. 0.9 months, p = 0.058). Conclusions T4 and esophageal stenosis at baseline independently increased the risk of esophageal fistula in ESCC treated by definitive CCRT with IMRT. There existed a trend toward improved survival after the fistula among patients receiving repair or stenting for esophageal perforation."
https://openalex.org/W3161639839,"The C-type lectin receptor langerin plays a vital role in the mammalian defense against invading pathogens. Langerin requires a Ca2+ cofactor, the binding affinity of which is regulated by pH. Thus, Ca2+ is bound when langerin is on the membrane but released when langerin and its pathogen substrate traffic to the acidic endosome, allowing the substrate to be degraded. The change in pH is sensed by protonation of the allosteric pH sensor histidine H294. However, the mechanism by which Ca2+ is released from the buried binding site is not clear. We studied the structural consequences of protonating H294 by molecular dynamics simulations (total simulation time: about 120 μs) and Markov models. We discovered a relay mechanism in which a proton is moved into the vicinity of the Ca2+-binding site without transferring the initial proton from H294. Protonation of H294 unlocks a conformation in which a protonated lysine side chain forms a hydrogen bond with a Ca2+-coordinating aspartic acid. This destabilizes Ca2+ in the binding pocket, which we probed by steered molecular dynamics. After Ca2+ release, the proton is likely transferred to the aspartic acid and stabilized by a dyad with a nearby glutamic acid, triggering a conformational transition and thus preventing Ca2+ rebinding. These results show how pH regulation of a buried orthosteric binding site from a solvent-exposed allosteric pH sensor can be realized by information transfer through a specific chain of conformational arrangements.

Protonation of H294 unlocks a conformation in which a protonated lysine side chain forms a hydrogen bond with a Ca2+-coordinating aspartic acid. This destabilizes Ca2+ in the binding pocket, which we probed by steered molecular dynamics. After Ca2+ release, the proton is likely transferred to the aspartic acid and stabilized by a dyad with a nearby glutamic acid, triggering a conformational transition and thus preventing Ca2+ rebinding. These results show how pH regulation of a buried orthosteric binding site from a solvent-exposed allosteric pH sensor can be realized by information transfer through a specific chain of conformational arrangements. When pathogens invade a mammal (or more specifically: a human), Langerhans cells capture some of the pathogens, process them, and present antigens to the adaptive immune system. The swift activation of the adaptive immune system is critical for the survival of the mammal, and langerin plays a vital role in this process. Langerin is a transmembrane carbohydrate receptor, which is expressed by Langerhans cells of mammalian skin and mucosa (1Valladeau J. Duvert-Frances V. Pin J.J. Dezutter- Dambuyant C. Vincent C.

Langerin recognizes these pathogens by binding to carbohydrates on the pathogen surface. Its carbohydrate-binding pocket contains a Ca2+ cation as cofactor that is essential for carbohydrate binding, and thus for the capture of pathogens. After the initial binding event, the pathogen is captured in an endocytic vesicle, and langerin releases the pathogen into the endosome (Fig. 1A) (1Valladeau J. Duvert-Frances V. Pin J.J.

This cargo release is triggered by a drop of pH from 7 in the extracellular medium to 5.5 to 6 in the early endosome (12Sorkin A. von Zastrow M.

Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) and by a substantial drop in the Ca2+ concentration from about 1 to 2 mM to a value in the micromolar range (13Cote R.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1335-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The pH-dependent cargo release is accomplished by a fascinating mechanism in which various chemical equilibria are carefully balanced. To be able to release the cargo into the more acidic endosome, the carbohydrate affinity of langerin needs to be pH dependent. However, the change in pH does not affect the carbohydrate binding itself. Instead, langerin depends on a Ca2+ cofactor for carbohydrate binding, and the observed pH dependence of the carbohydrate affinity is caused by an underlying pH dependence of the Ca2+ affinity (17Hanske J. Aleksic S. Ballaschk M. Jurk M. Shanina E. Beerbaum M. Schmieder P. Keller B.G. Rademacher C. Intradomain allosteric network modulates calcium affinity of the C-type lectin receptor langerin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 12176-12186Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the Ca2+ affinity is lower at pH 6 than at pH 7. The pH sensitivity, measured as the difference in the Ca2+ binding free energies, is ΔΔG = 5.1 kJ mol−1 (17Hanske J. Aleksic S. Ballaschk M. Jurk M. Shanina E. Beerbaum M. Schmieder P. Keller B.G. Rademacher C. Intradomain allosteric network modulates calcium affinity of the C-type lectin receptor langerin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 12176-12186Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). At high Ca2+ concentrations (10 mM) the carbohydrate affinity ceases to be pH dependent, because the excess in Ca2+ outweighs any change in Ca2+ affinity due to a change in pH. However, in the endosome the Ca2+ concentration is low. Thus, the drop in pH from the extracellular medium to the endosome causes a decrease in Ca2+ affinity, and the unbinding of the Ca2+ cofactor leads to the dissociation of the carbohydrate ligand and to the release of the pathogen. Similarly, pH sensitivities of either ligand or Ca2+ affinities have been observed for several other C-type lectins (18Stambach N.S. Taylor M.E.

Chem. 2008; 283: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (example structures in Fig. S32). In DC-SIGNR and LSECtin, which have a different biological role than langerin, a drop in pH causes an increase in ligand affinity. The mechanisms underlying the regulation by the pH in C-type lectins are highly diverse and not yet studied in detail. The observation that the Ca2+ affinity in C-type lectins is pH dependent is surprising. First, when a carbohydrate (and attached to it an entire virus) is bound to a C-type lectin, the Ca2+-binding site is almost certainly not solvent exposed. Second, the Ca2+ in C-type lectins is coordinated by either aspartate or glutamate side chains, whose reference pKa values (27Lide R.D. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. 87th Ed. CRC Press, West Palm Beach, FL2006Google Scholar) (in water at 25 °C) are 3.71 (aspartate) and 4.15 (glutamate). By themselves, these residues are not sensitive to a change in pH from 7 to 6. Pairs of acidic residues can in principle form a protonated dyad, which is the close arrangement of two residues with acidic side chains such that protonation of their carboxyl groups is coupled. This results in an increased pKa of the protonated residue, stabilized by the unprotonated form of the other group. Prominent examples of this effect are found in the proteins HIV-1 protease (28Hyland L.J. Tomaszek T.A. Meek T.D. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease. 2.

Yue Z. Tsai C.-C. Henderson J.A. Shen J. Predicting catalytic proton donors and nucleophiles in enzymes: How adding dynamics helps elucidate the structure–function relationships.J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2018; 9: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The presence of organic ligands can increase these values further (32Yamazaki T. Nicholson L.K. Torchia D.A. Wingfield P.

Soc. 1994; 116: 10791-10792Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, a protonated dyad can only form if Ca2+ has already left the binding pocket. So, the question arises: how do C-type lectins sense a change in pH, and how does this lead to the release of Ca2+? For langerin we previously identified the histidine residue H294 as a partial pH sensor that regulates the Ca2+ affinity (17Hanske J. Aleksic S. Ballaschk M. Jurk M. Shanina E. Beerbaum M. Schmieder P. Keller B.G. Rademacher C. Intradomain allosteric network modulates calcium affinity of the C-type lectin receptor langerin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 12176-12186Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The reference pKa of histidine is 6.04 (in water at 25 °C) (27Lide R.D. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. 87th Ed. CRC Press, West Palm Beach, FL2006Google Scholar), which makes it sensitive to a pH change from 7 to 6. When H294 is mutated to A294, the pH sensitivity is about 40% smaller than in the wildtype (ΔΔG = 3.1 kJ mol−1 upon a change in pH from 7 to 6). Because the histidine side chain points away from the Ca2+-binding site, it is unlikely that the decrease in Ca2+ affinity is caused by electrostatic repulsion between the protonated histidine and the Ca2+. This mechanism has been suggested for the C-type lectin ASGPR, in which, however, the histidine pH sensor is located directly underneath the Ca2+-binding pocket (Fig. S32D) (20Wragg S. Drickamer K. Identification of amino acid residues that determine pH dependence of ligand binding to the asialoglycoprotein receptor during endocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35400-35406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Instead, we showed—by combining NMR experiments, site-directed point mutations, and molecular dynamics simulations—that H294 is at the center of an allosteric network that contains the Ca2+-binding site. More specifically, in its unprotonated form H294 forms a hydrogen bond with lysine K257, which is also present in the known crystal structures of langerin (16Feinberg H. Powlesland A.S. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Trimeric structure of langerin.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13285-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This hydrogen bond cannot be formed if H294 is protonated, and the allosteric mechanism that regulates the Ca2+ affinity likely hinges on this hydrogen bond. Yet, protonation of H294 is only the initial detection that the surrounding medium has changed. Even though we identified the residues that are involved in the allosteric network, we do not yet understand how the protonation of H294 could ultimately affect the Ca2+-binding pocket. Several allosteric effects have been reported for C-type lectins (see ref. (33Keller B.G. Rademacher C. Allostery in C-type lectins.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2020; 62: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) for a recent review), but little is known about their underlying molecular mechanisms that could be applied to the situation in langerin. The goal of this study is to elucidate how the protonation of H294 changes the conformational ensemble of langerin and to investigate the effect these conformational changes have on the Ca2+-binding pocket. A model of how the signal, that the pH has changed, traverses the allosteric network to the buried Ca2+-binding site and triggers the Ca2+ release might serve as a blueprint for understanding how pH-sensitive ligand binding is achieved in C-type lectins and other proteins. Langerin forms a homotrimer. The monomers consist of a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region, and a long alpha-helical neck (residues 56–197) extending into the extracellular milieu, which carries the C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (16Feinberg H. Powlesland A.S. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Trimeric structure of langerin.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13285-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Stambach N.S. Taylor M.E. Characterization of carbohydrate recognition by langerin, a C-type lectin of Langerhans cells.Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate recognition domain has the typical C-type lectin domain fold (Fig. 1B) (4Zelensky A.N. Gready J.E. The C-type lectin-like domain superfamily.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6179-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), which consists of two extended β sheets (turquoise), each composed of three single strands. The two β sheets are flanked by three α helices (purple, α3 in red). The carbohydrate-binding pocket, which contains the Ca2+-binding site, is located on top of the β4 strand. One residue from this β sheet directly binds to the Ca2+: D308. In addition, the Ca2+ is held in place by E293 and E285 in the long-loop (blue), which coordinate to Ca2+ from the side. E285 is part of a conserved EPN-motif (E285, P286, N287 in langerin), which determines the selectivity for mannose, fucose, and glucose over galactose (18Stambach N.S. Taylor M.E. Characterization of carbohydrate recognition by langerin, a C-type lectin of Langerhans cells.Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 34Drickamer K. Engineering galactose-binding activity into a C-type mannose-binding protein.Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 35Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Recent insights into structures and functions of C-type lectins in the immune system.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2015; 34: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The pH sensor H294 (pink) is located at the end of the long-loop. If its side chain is unprotonated, it forms a hydrogen bond to K257 (also pink) in the short-loop (orange). The allosteric network that regulates the Ca2+ affinity comprises the long- and the short-loop (17Hanske J. Aleksic S. Ballaschk M. Jurk M. Shanina E. Beerbaum M. Schmieder P. Keller B.G. Rademacher C. Intradomain allosteric network modulates calcium affinity of the C-type lectin receptor langerin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 12176-12186Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). H229 (yellow) is the only other histidine residue in the langerin carbohydrate recognition domain. A pathogen would bind via a carbohydrate ligand (dark red) to langerin and would be separated from the pH sensor by the long-loop. If Ca2+ is bound to langerin, we will call the system holo-langerin, otherwise apo-langerin. We conducted 31 μs of molecular dynamics simulations of holo-langerin, in which all residues were protonated according to their default protonation state at pH 7, i.e., H294 was unprotonated, and the overall protein was neutral (neutral state). We compare these simulations with 27 μs of holo-langerin, in which H294 was protonated (protonated state). Protonation of H294 has no influence on the secondary structure of langerin (Fig. 2A, Fig. S1). Thus, any conformational change due to the protonation of H294 affects the side chains, or those residues that are not assigned to a specific secondary structure, i.e., the loop regions. One way a conformational change in the loop regions could manifest itself, is by a change of the loop flexibility. This is, however, not corroborated by the root-mean-square fluctuations of the individual residues (Fig. 2B). The short-loop (sharp peak around residue 260) and the α3 helix (broad peak around residue 275) are more rigid in the protonated state, but the difference is very small. The flexibility in all other regions of the protein, and in particular the long-loop region, does not change upon protonation. To gauge whether protonation of H294 has an influence on the conformation of the Ca2+-binding site, we measured the distance distribution between the carboxyl group of the Ca2+-coordinating residues—E285, E293, and D308—and the Ca2+ (Fig. 2, C and D). For E293 and D308 the differences are too minor to explain the observed difference in Ca2+ affinity. For E285 the distribution shifts slightly to lower distances and thus to a potentially tightly bound Ca2+, not explaining it either. The distance difference between the two populated states is about 0.05 nm. Yet, we know from our previous analyses (17Hanske J. Aleksic S. Ballaschk M. Jurk M. Shanina E. Beerbaum M. Schmieder P. Keller B.G. Rademacher C. Intradomain allosteric network modulates calcium affinity of the C-type lectin receptor langerin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 12176-12186Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that protonation of H294 causes a significant shift in the conformational ensemble, and this is again confirmed by the distance distributions between the H294 side chain and the Ca2+ in the neutral and the protonated state (Fig. 2E). In the protonated state the distribution shifts to larger distances, well beyond 1 nm. At this distance, we do not expect a significant influence of the positively charged H294 side chain on the Ca2+, considering that H294 is located on the protein surface and that the dielectric constant between the two interacting groups is relatively high (see Figs. S20 and S21 for an assessment of the Coulomb interaction) (36Li L. Li C. Zhang Z. Alexov E. On the dielectric “constant” of proteins: Smooth dielectric function for macromolecular modeling and its implementation in DelPhi.J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2013; 9: 2126-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Thus, we can rule out that the decrease in Ca2+ affinity is caused by direct Coulomb repulsion between the protonated H294 and the Ca2+. To uncover which residues besides H294 are involved in the conformational shift, one needs to compare the two conformational ensembles. This cannot be accomplished in the full high-dimensional conformational space. Instead, one needs to project the two ensembles into a low-dimensional space that is representative of both systems. Principal component analysis (37Jolliffe I.T. Principal Component Analysis.2nd Ed. Springer, New York, NY2002Google Scholar) identifies low-dimensional spaces that preserve the directions of the largest conformational variance (38Scherer M.K. Trendelkamp-Schroer B. Paul F. Pérez-Hernández G. Hoffmann M. Plattner N. Wehmeyer C. Prinz J.-H. Noé F. PyEMMA 2: A software package for estimation, validation, and analysis of Markov models.J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2015; 11: 5525-5542Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). To be able to directly compare the neutral and the protonated ensemble, we combined the simulations in the two protonation states to obtain a joint principal component space. The principal component with the largest variance represents the opening and closing of the gap between the short-loop and long-loop (blue sequence of structures in Fig. 3A). The second principal component represents a sideways shear motion of the short-loop (orange sequence of structures in Fig. 3A). This is in line with our previous finding that the allosteric network is centered on these two loops (17Hanske J. Aleksic S. Ballaschk M. Jurk M. Shanina E. Beerbaum M. Schmieder P. Keller B.G. Rademacher C. Intradomain allosteric network modulates calcium affinity of the C-type lectin receptor langerin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 12176-12186Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Even though the two principal components cover only about 28% of the total structural variance (Fig. 3B), they represent the conformational fluctuations that are most sensitive to a protonation of H294. Separate principal component analyses of the two protonation states yielded principal components that were almost identical, indicating that the joint principal components are a faithful representation of the largest variances for both protonation states. Figure 3C shows the free energy surface of the two systems in the space of the first two joint principal components. The free-energy surface of the unprotonated system is shallow with two minima corresponding to the open and closed states of the short- and long-loop. Upon protonation, the free energy surface becomes much steeper and more structured. One can discern at least three minima. The difference plot of the probability densities in the neutral and protonated states (Fig. 3C to the right) shows these emerging conformations in red. We extracted the highly populated regions by clustering in the space of the first two principal components using the density-based common-nearest-neighbors cluster algorithm (39Keller B.G.

https://openalex.org/W3163760826,"Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a nonthermal tumor/cell ablation technique in which a series of high-voltage short pulses are used. As a new approach, we aimed to investigate the rupture of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) using the IRE technique under different osmotic pressures (Π), and estimated the membrane tension due to Π. Two categories of GUVs were used in this study. One was prepared with a mixture of dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and cholesterol (chol) for obtaining more biological relevance while other with a mixture of DOPG and DOPC, with specific molar ratios. We determined the rate constant (kp) of rupture of DOPG/DOPC/chol (46/39/15)-GUVs and DOPG/DOPC (40/60)-GUVs induced by constant electric tension (σc) under different Π. The σc dependent kp values were fitted with a theoretical equation, and the corresponding membrane tension (σoseq) at swelling equilibrium under Π was estimated. The estimated membrane tension agreed well with the theoretical calculation within the experimental error. Interestingly, the values of σoseq were almost same for both types of synthesized GUVs under same osmotic pressure. We also examined the sucrose leakage, due to large osmotic pressure-induced pore formation, from the inside of DOPG/DOPC/chol(46/39/15)-GUVs. The estimated membrane tension due to large Π at which sucrose leaked out was very similar to the electric tension at which GUVs were ruptured without Π. We explained the σc and Π induced pore formation in the lipid membranes of GUVs."
https://openalex.org/W3162592705,"Sperm capacitation is essential to gain fertilizing capacity. During this process, a series of biochemical and physiological modifications occur that allow sperm to undergo acrosomal exocytosis (AE). At the molecular level, hyperpolarization of the sperm membrane potential (Em) takes place during capacitation. This study shows that human sperm incubated under conditions that do not support capacitation (NC) can become ready for an agonist stimulated AE by pharmacologically inducing Em hyperpolarization with Valinomycin or Amiloride. To investigate how Em hyperpolarization promotes human sperm’s ability to undergo AE, live single-cell imaging experiments were performed to simultaneously monitor changes in [Ca2+]i and the occurrence of AE. Em hyperpolarization turned [Ca2+]i dynamics in NC sperm from spontaneously oscillating into a sustained slow [Ca2+]i increase. The addition of progesterone (P4) or K+ to Valinomycin-treated sperm promoted that a significant number of cells displayed a transitory rise in [Ca2+]i which then underwent AE. Altogether, our results demonstrate that Em hyperpolarization is necessary and sufficient to prepare human sperm for the AE. Furthermore, this Em change decreased Ca2+ oscillations that block the occurrence of AE, providing strong experimental evidence of the molecular mechanism that drives the acquisition of acrosomal responsiveness."

Geographic mobility, including travel for work, education, or personal reasons, may also play a role in TB transmission, but this relationship is poorly defined. We aimed to define geographic mobility among participants in facility- and community-based TB case finding in Kampala, Uganda, and to assess associations between mobility, access to care, and TB disease.We included consecutive individuals age ≥15 years diagnosed with TB disease through either routine health facility practices or community-based case finding (consisting of door-to-door testing, venue-based screening, and contact investigation). Each case was matched with one (for community-based enrollment) or two (health facility enrollment) TB-negative controls. We conducted a latent class analysis (LCA) of eight self-reported characteristics to identify and define mobility; we selected the best-fit model using Bayesian Information Criterion. We assessed associations between mobility and TB case status using multivariable conditional logistic regression.We enrolled 267 cases and 432 controls. Cases were more likely than controls to have been born in Kampala (p<0.001); there was no difference between cases and controls for remaining mobility characteristics. We selected a two-class LCA model; the ""mobile"" class was perfectly correlated with a single variable: travel (>3 km) from residence ≥2 times per month. Mobility was associated with a 28% reduction in odds of being a TB case (adjusted matched odds ratio 0.72 [95% confidence interval 0.49, 1.06]).Frequency of out-of-neighborhood travel is an easily measured variable that correlates closely with predicted mobility class membership. Mobility was associated with decreased risk of TB disease; this may be in part due to the higher socioeconomic status of mobile individuals in this population. However, more research is needed to improve assessment of mobility and understand how mobility affects disease risk and transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3163735880,"Background Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major and increasing public health problem that may be underdiagnosed and undertreated among persons living with HIV (PLWH). Objective To describe the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of DM among PLWH. Methods This study was performed inside a monocentric cohort of 1494 PLWH. DM was defined as having a FG ≥126 mg/dL twice or a HbA1c ≥6.5%, or a history of diabetes, or receiving antidiabetic treatment. The first visit mentioning a diagnosis of DM was considered as the baseline visit. Chi-Square or Fisher exact test were used to examine the association between categorical variables and DM, Wilcoxon or Student t-test were used for continuous variables. Results 156 PLWH with DM were included. Compared to non-diabetic participants, they were more likely to be native of Sub Saharan Africa (31.6% vs. 22.4%, p = 0.027) and older (54.6 vs. 49.9 years, p&lt;0.001), to have a higher BMI (&gt; 25 for 46.1% vs. 35.3%, p = 0.020) and a poorer control of HIV (HIV RNA&lt;50 copies/mL: 80.1% vs. 89.5%, p&lt;0.001). The diagnosis of DM was missed in 37.8% of PLWH, and 47.2% of PLWH treated for DM did not reach a HbA1c&lt;7%. PLWH with DM were more frequently on antihypertensive and/or lipid-lowering medications: 94.2% had a LDL-cholesterol &lt;70 mg/dL and 60.9% had a blood pressure &lt;140/90 mmHg. Conclusion In a setting of HIV-control, HIV care providers should focus on metabolic issues. The management of DM and associated risk factors is mandatory to prevent cardiovascular disease in PLWH."
https://openalex.org/W3160577570,"Increased oxidative stress, leukocyte telomere length (LTL) shortening, endothelial dysfunction, and lower insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 concentrations reflect key molecular mechanisms of aging. We hypothesized that biomarkers representing these pathways are associated with measures of subclinical atherosclerosis and all-cause mortality.We evaluated up to 2,314 Framingham Offspring Study participants (mean age 61 years, 55% women) with available biomarkers of aging: LTL, circulating concentrations of IGF-1, asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), and urinary F2-Isoprostanes indexed to urinary creatinine. We evaluated the association of each biomarker with coronary artery calcium [ln (CAC+1)] and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). In multivariable-adjusted linear regression models, higher ADMA levels were associated with higher CAC values (βADMA per 1-SD increase 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.11, 0.39]). Additionally, shorter LTL and lower IGF-1 values were associated with higher IMT values (βLTL -0.08, 95%CI -0.14, -0.02, and βIGF-1 -0.04, 95%CI -0.08, -0.01, respectively). During a median follow-up of 15.5 years, 593 subjects died. In multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models, LTL and IGF-1 values were inversely associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratios [HR] per SD increase in biomarker, 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.99, and 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-0.98 for LTL and IGF-1, respectively). F2-Isoprostanes and ADMA values were positively associated with all-cause mortality (HR per SD increase in biomarker, 1.15, 95% CI, 1.10-1.22, and 1.10, 95% CI, 1.02-1.20, respectively).In our prospective community-based study, aging-related biomarkers were associated with measures of subclinical atherosclerosis cross-sectionally and with all-cause mortality prospectively, supporting the concept that these biomarkers may reflect the aging process in community-dwelling adults."
https://openalex.org/W3161858398,"Music has a unique capacity to evoke both strong emotions and vivid autobiographical memories. Previous music information retrieval (MIR) studies have shown that the emotional experience of music is influenced by a combination of musical features, including tonal, rhythmic, and loudness features. Here, our aim was to explore the relationship between music-evoked emotions and music-evoked memories and how musical features (derived with MIR) can predict them both.Healthy older adults (N = 113, age ≥ 60 years) participated in a listening task in which they rated a total of 140 song excerpts comprising folk songs and popular songs from 1950s to 1980s on five domains measuring the emotional (valence, arousal, emotional intensity) and memory (familiarity, autobiographical salience) experience of the songs. A set of 24 musical features were extracted from the songs using computational MIR methods. Principal component analyses were applied to reduce multicollinearity, resulting in six core musical components, which were then used to predict the behavioural ratings in multiple regression analyses.All correlations between behavioural ratings were positive and ranged from moderate to very high (r = 0.46-0.92). Emotional intensity showed the highest correlation to both autobiographical salience and familiarity. In the MIR data, three musical components measuring salience of the musical pulse (Pulse strength), relative strength of high harmonics (Brightness), and fluctuation in the frequencies between 200-800 Hz (Low-mid) predicted both music-evoked emotions and memories. Emotional intensity (and valence to a lesser extent) mediated the predictive effect of the musical components on music-evoked memories.The results suggest that music-evoked emotions are strongly related to music-evoked memories in healthy older adults and that both music-evoked emotions and memories are predicted by the same core musical features."
https://openalex.org/W3161893817,"Access to major services, often located in urban centres, is key to the realisation of numerous Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In Kenya, there are no up-to-date and localised estimates of spatial access to urban centres. We estimate the travel time to urban centres and identify marginalised populations for prioritisation and targeting.Urban centres were mapped from the 2019 Kenya population census and combined with spatial databases of road networks, elevation, land use and travel barriers within a cost-friction algorithm to compute travel time. Seven travel scenarios were considered: i) walking only (least optimistic), ii) bicycle only, iii) motorcycle only, iv) vehicle only (most optimistic), v) walking followed by motorcycle transport, vi) walking followed by vehicle transport, and vii) walking followed by motorcycle and then vehicle transport (most pragmatic). Mean travel time, and proportion of the population within 1-hour and 2-hours of the urban centres were summarized at sub-national units (counties) used for devolved planning. Inequities were explored and correlations between the proportion of the population within 1-hour of an urban centre and ten SDG indicators were computed.A total of 307 urban centres were digitised. Nationally, the mean travel time was 4.5-hours for the walking-only scenario, 1.0-hours for the vehicle only (most optimistic) scenario and 1.5-hours for the walking-motorcycle-vehicle (most pragmatic) scenario. Forty-five per cent (21.3 million people) and 87% (41.6 million people) of Kenya's population resided within 1-hour of the nearest urban centre for the least optimistic and most pragmatic scenarios respectively. Over 3.2 million people were considered marginalised or living outside the 2-hour threshold in the pragmatic scenario, 16.0 million Kenyans for walking only, and 2.2 million for the most optimistic scenario. County-level spatial access was highly heterogeneous ranging between 8%-100% and 32%-100% of people within the 1-hour threshold for the least and most optimistic scenarios, respectively. Counties in northern and eastern parts of Kenya were generally most marginalised. The correlation coefficients for nine SDG indicators ranged between 0.45 to 0.78 and were statistically significant.Travel time to urban centres in Kenya is heterogeneous. Therefore, marginalised populations should be prioritised during resource allocation and policies should be formulated to enhance equitable access to public services and opportunities in urban areas."

https://openalex.org/W3160060401,"Certain species of pathogenic bacteria damage tissues by secreting cholesterol-dependent cytolysins, which form pores in the plasma membranes of animal cells. However, reducing cholesterol protects cells against these cytolysins. As the first committed step of cholesterol biosynthesis is catalyzed by squalene synthase, we explored whether inhibiting this enzyme protected cells against cholesterol-dependent cytolysins. We first synthesized 22 different nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate molecules that were designed to inhibit squalene synthase. Squalene synthase inhibition was quantified using a cell-free enzyme assay, and validated by computer modeling of bisphosphonate molecules binding to squalene synthase. The bisphosphonates were then screened for their ability to protect HeLa cells against the damage caused by the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, pyolysin. The most effective bisphosphonate reduced pyolysin-induced leakage of lactate dehydrogenase into cell supernatants by >80%, and reduced pyolysin-induced cytolysis from >75% to <25%. In addition, this bisphosphonate reduced pyolysin-induced leakage of potassium from cells, limited changes in the cytoskeleton, prevented mitogen-activated protein kinases cell stress responses, and reduced cellular cholesterol. The bisphosphonate also protected cells against another cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, streptolysin O, and protected lung epithelial cells and primary dermal fibroblasts against cytolysis. Our findings imply that treatment with bisphosphonates that inhibit squalene synthase might help protect tissues against pathogenic bacteria that secrete cholesterol-dependent cytolysins."
https://openalex.org/W3163883937,"Cathepsin H (CTSH) is a type 1 diabetes (T1D) risk gene; large-scale genetic and epidemiological studies found that T1D genetic risk correlates with high CTSH expression, rapid decline of beta-cell function, and early onset T1D. Counterintuitively, transcriptional downregulation of CTSH by proinflammatory cytokines has been shown to promote beta-cell apoptosis. Here, we potentially explain these observed contrasting effects, describing a new mechanism where proinflammatory cytokines and T1D genetic risk variants regulate CTSH transcription via differential DNA methylation. We show that, in human islets, CTSH downregulation by the proinflammatory cytokine cocktail interleukin 1β + tumor necrosis factor α + interferon γ was coupled with DNA hypermethylation in an open chromatin region in CTSH intron 1. A luciferase assay in human embryonic kidney 293 cells revealed that methylation of three key cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) residues in intron 1 was responsible for the reduction of promoter activity. We further found that cytokine-induced intron 1 hypermethylation is caused by lowered Tet1/3 activities, suggesting that attenuated active demethylation lowered CTSH transcription. Importantly, individuals who carry the T1D risk variant showed lower methylation variability at the intron 1 CpG residues, presumably making them less sensitive to cytokines, whereas individuals who carry the protective variant showed higher methylation variability, presumably making them more sensitive to cytokines and implying differential responses to environment between the two patient populations. These findings suggest that genetic and environmental influences on a T1D locus are mediated by differential variability and mean of DNA methylation."

While conventional chemical and biological solutions to these challenges are characteristically slow to develop and reach public availability; recent advances in device components operating at Super High Frequency (SHF) bands (3–30 GHz) of the electromagnetic spectrum enable novel approaches to such problems. Methods Based on experimentally documented evidence, a clinically relevant in situ radiation procedure to reduce viral loads in patients is devised and presented. Adapted to the currently available medical device technology to cause viral membrane fracture, this procedure selectively inactivates virus particles by forced oscillations arising from Structure Resonant Energy Transfer (SRET) thereby reducing infectivity and disease progression. Results Effective resonant frequencies for pleiomorphic Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is calculated to be in the 10–17 GHz range.

https://openalex.org/W3161931665,"Synaptic plasticity is vital for brain function and memory formation. One of the key proteins in long-term synaptic plasticity and memory is the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc). Mammalian Arc forms virus-like capsid structures in a process requiring the N-terminal domain and contains two C-terminal lobes that are structural homologues to retroviral capsids. Drosophila has two isoforms of Arc, dArc1 and dArc2, with low sequence similarity to mammalian Arc, but lacking a large N-terminal domain. Both dArc isoforms are related to the Ty3/gypsy retrotransposon capsid, consisting of N- and C-terminal lobes. Structures of dArc1, as well as capsids formed by both dArc isoforms, have been recently determined. We carried out structural characterization of the four individual dArc lobe domains. As opposed to the corresponding mammalian Arc lobe domains, which are monomeric, the dArc lobes were all oligomeric in solution, indicating a strong propensity for homophilic interactions. A truncated N-lobe from dArc2 formed a domain-swapped dimer in the crystal structure, resulting in a novel dimer interaction that could be relevant for capsid assembly or other dArc functions. This domain-swapped structure resembles the dimeric protein C of flavivirus capsids, as well as the structure of histones dimers, domain-swapped transcription factors, and membrane-interacting BAK domains. The strong oligomerization properties of the isolated dArc lobe domains explain the ability of dArc to form capsids in the absence of any large N-terminal domain, in contrast to the mammalian protein."
https://openalex.org/W3162000892,"Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) is a potent mitogen that activates the IGF receptor (IGFR)/insulin receptor substrate (IRS) axis, thus stimulating growth in normal cells and uncontrolled cell proliferation in cancer. Posttranslational modifications of IRS such as ubiquitination tightly control IGF signaling, and we previously identified IRS-1 as a potential substrate for the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF4 using an unbiased screen. Here we provide evidence that TRAF4-mediated ubiquitination of IRS-1 is physiologically relevant and crucial for IGF signal transduction. Through site-directed mutagenesis we found that TRAF4 promotes an atypical K29-linked ubiquitination at the C-terminal end of IRS-1. Its depletion abolishes AKT and ERK phosphorylation downstream of IGF-1 and inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation. Overexpression of TRAF4 enhances IGF1-induced IGFR-IRS-1 interaction, IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and downstream effector protein activation, whereas mutation of IRS-1 ubiquitination sites completely abolishes these effects. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that nonproteolytic ubiquitination of IRS-1 is a key step in conveying IGF-1 stimulation from IGFR to IRS-1."
https://openalex.org/W3162605630,"Organizations and other groups often recognize the importance of members treating each other in a fair (dignified, unbiased) manner. This type of treatment is key to fostering individuals’ sense of belonging in the group. However, while a sense of belonging is important, individuals also need to be shown that they have some distinct value to the group–enabling them to not only “fit in” but also “stand out.” Building from research on fair treatment, we explicate another form, distinctive treatment , whereby others show interest and appreciation for an individual’s more distinguishing, group-relevant qualities. In six studies using multiple methods (e.g., experimental, longitudinal) and in multiple types of groups (work organizations, student communities, racial/ethnic minority groups), we show that fair and distinctive treatment play fundamentally different roles–shaping individuals’ perceived belonging versus intragroup standing, respectively–and with downstream benefits for mental health (less anxiety, fewer depressive symptoms). Overall, this illustrates that promoting fair treatment in groups is important, but not sufficient. Experiencing distinctive treatment is also key. Each type of treatment provides unique social evaluative information that fosters a healthy sense of self. This research further indicates that distinctive treatment may be a vital yet overlooked element to promoting diversity and inclusion in groups, as it provides a path for recognizing and appreciating, and thus encouraging, a diversity of ideas, insights, knowledge and skills that individuals bring to the group."

Lack of evidence for the prevalence and associated factors of acute respiratory infection among street sweepers and door-to-door waste collectors in Dessie City, Ethiopia is a challenge for the implementation of appropriate measures to control acute respiratory infection. Thus, this study was designed to address the gaps.A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among 84 door-to-door waste collectors and 84 street sweepers from March to May 2018. A simple random sampling technique was used to select study participants. Data were collected by trained data collectors using a pretested structured questionnaire and on-the-spot direct observation checklist. Data were analyzed using three different binary logistic regression models at 95% confidence interval (CI): the first model (Model I) was used to identify factors associated with acute respiratory infection among street sweepers, whereas the second model (Model II) was used to identify factors associated with acute respiratory infection among door-to-door waste collectors, and the third model (Model III) was used for pooled analysis to identify factors associated with acute respiratory infection among both street sweepers and door-to-door waste collectors. From each model multivariable logistic regression, variables with a p-value <0.05 were taken as factors significantly associated with acute respiratory infection.The overall prevalence of acute respiratory infection among studied population was 42.85% with 95% CI (35.1, 50.0%). The prevalence of acute respiratory infection among street sweepers was 48.80% (95% CI: 37.3, 64.8%) and among door-to-door waste collectors was 36.90% (95% CI: 27.4, 46.4%). There was no statistically significant difference between the prevalence of acute respiratory infection among the two groups due to the overlapping of the 95% CI. Among the street sweepers, we found that factors significantly associated with acute respiratory infection were not cleaning personal protective equipment after use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.40; 95% CI: 1.15, 5.51) and use of coal/wood for cooking (AOR: 3.95; 95% CI: 1.52, 7.89), whereas among door-to-door waste collectors, were not using a nose/mouth mask while on duty (AOR: 5.57; 95% CI: 1.39, 9.32) and not receiving health and safety training (AOR: 3.82; 95% CI: 1.14-7.03) were factors significantly associated with acute respiratory infection among door-to-door-waste collectors. From the pooled analysis, we found that not using a nose/mouth mask while on duty (AOR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.16, 4.53) and using coal/wood for cooking (AOR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.18, 6.95) were factors significantly associated with acute respiratory infection for both street sweepers and door-to-door waste collectors.The prevalence of acute respiratory infection among street sweepers and door-to-door waste collectors has no statistically significant difference. For both groups, not using a nose/mouth mask while on duty and using coal/wood for cooking fuel factors associated with acute respiratory infection.

There is an unmet need for a realistic model of diabetic cataract for mechanistic and longitudinal studies, as existing models do not reflect key aspects of the complex human disease. Here, we introduce and characterize diabetic cataract in the Nile grass rat (NGR, Arvicanthis niloticus), an established model of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We conducted a longitudinal study of cataract in over 88 NGRs in their non-diabetic, pre-diabetic, and diabetic stages of metabolism. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results distinguished the metabolic stages. Diverse cataract types were observed in the course of diabetes, including cortical, posterior subcapsular (PSC), and anterior subcapsular (ASC), all of which succeeded a characteristic dotted ring stage in all animals. The onset ages of diabetes and cataract were 44 ± 3 vs 29 ± 1 (P < .001) and 66 ± 5 vs 58 ± 6 (not significant) weeks in females and males, respectively. Histological analysis revealed fiber disorganization, vacuolar structures, and cellular proliferation and migration in cataractous lenses. The lens epithelial cells (LECs) in non-diabetic young NGRs expressed the stress marker GRP78, as did LECs and migrated cells in the lenses of diabetic animals. Elucidating mechanisms underlying LEC proliferation and migration will be clinically valuable in prevention and treatment of posterior capsule opacification, a dreaded complication of cataract surgery. Marked changes in N-cadherin expression emphasized a role for LEC integrity in cataractogenesis. Apoptotic cells were dispersed in the equatorial areas in early cataractogenesis. Our study reveals diverse cataract types that spontaneously develop in the diabetic NGR, and which uniquely mirror the cataract and its chronic course of development in individuals with diabetes. We provide mechanistic insights into early stages of diabetic cataract. These unique characteristics make NGR highly suited for mechanistic studies, especially in the context of metabolism, diabetes, and aging."

However, assessing the quality of the result produced from this technique is one of its major implementation challenges. To bridge this gap, the National tuberculosis reference laboratory (NTRL) introduced the GeneXpert MTB/RIF proficiency testing (PT) Scheme in 2015.A descriptive cross-sectional study on the GeneXpert PT scheme in Uganda was conducted between 2015 and 2018. Sets of panels each comprising four 1ml cryovial liquid samples were sent out to enrolled participants at preset testing periods. The laboratories' testing accuracies were assessed by comparing their reported results to the expected and participants' consensus results. Percentage scores were assigned and feedback reports were sent back to laboratories. Follow up of sites with unsatisfactory results was done through ""on and off-site support"". Concurrently, standardization of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and practices to the requirements of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 17043:2010 was pursued.Participants gradually increased during the program from 56 in the pilot study to 148 in Round 4 (2018). Continual participation of a particular laboratory yielded an odd of 2.5 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22 to 4.34] times greater for achieving a score of above 80% with each new round it participated. The ""on and off-site"" support supervision documented improved performance of failing laboratories. Records of GeneXpert MTB/RIF PT were used to achieve accreditation to ISO 17043:2010 in 2018.Continued participation in GeneXpert MTB/RIF PT improves testing accuracy of laboratories.

https://openalex.org/W3163901591,"Tripartite motif (TRIM)7 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that was first identified through its interaction with glycogenin-1 (GN1), the autoglucosyltransferase that initiates glycogen biosynthesis. A growing body of evidence indicates that TRIM7 plays an important role in cancer development, viral pathogenesis, and atherosclerosis and, thus, represents a potential therapeutic target. TRIM family proteins share a multidomain architecture with a conserved N-terminal TRIM and a variable C-terminal domain. Human TRIM7 contains the canonical TRIM motif and a B30.2 domain at the C terminus. To contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of action of TRIM7, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of its B30.2 domain (TRIM7B30.2) in two crystal forms at resolutions of 1.6 Å and 1.8 Å. TRIM7B30.2 exhibits the typical B30.2 domain fold, consisting of two antiparallel β-sheets of seven and six strands, arranged as a distorted β-sandwich. Furthermore, two long loops partially cover the concave face of the β-sandwich defined by the β-sheet of six strands, thus forming a positively charged cavity. We used sequence conservation and mutational analyses to provide evidence of a putative binding interface for GN1. These studies showed that Leu423, Ser499, and Cys501 of TRIM7B30.2 and the C-terminal 33 amino acids of GN1 are critical for this binding interaction. Molecular dynamics simulations also revealed that hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions play a major role in the stability of a modeled TRIM7B30.2-GN1 C-terminal peptide complex. These data provide useful information that could be used to target this interaction for the development of potential therapeutic agents. Tripartite motif (TRIM)7 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that was first identified through its interaction with glycogenin-1 (GN1), the autoglucosyltransferase that initiates glycogen biosynthesis. A growing body of evidence indicates that TRIM7 plays an important role in cancer development, viral pathogenesis, and atherosclerosis and, thus, represents a potential therapeutic target. TRIM family proteins share a multidomain architecture with a conserved N-terminal TRIM and a variable C-terminal domain. Human TRIM7 contains the canonical TRIM motif and a B30.2 domain at the C terminus. To contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of action of TRIM7, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of its B30.2 domain (TRIM7B30.2) in two crystal forms at resolutions of 1.6 Å and 1.8 Å. TRIM7B30.2 exhibits the typical B30.2 domain fold, consisting of two antiparallel β-sheets of seven and six strands, arranged as a distorted β-sandwich. Furthermore, two long loops partially cover the concave face of the β-sandwich defined by the β-sheet of six strands, thus forming a positively charged cavity. We used sequence conservation and mutational analyses to provide evidence of a putative binding interface for GN1. These studies showed that Leu423, Ser499, and Cys501 of TRIM7B30.2 and the C-terminal 33 amino acids of GN1 are critical for this binding interaction.

These data provide useful information that could be used to target this interaction for the development of potential therapeutic agents. Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins constitute a family of over 80 members encoded in the human genome (1Hatakeyama S. TRIM family proteins: Roles in autophagy, immunity, and carcinogenesis.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2017; 42: 297-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) that participate in diverse cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, autophagy, oncogenesis, innate immunity, and viral replication (reviewed in (1Hatakeyama S.

Gack M.U. TRIM proteins and their roles in antiviral host defenses.Annu. Rev. Virol. 2018; 5: 385-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)). They share a multimodular architecture with a conserved N-terminal TRIM, also called RBCC motif, and a variable C-terminal region. The TRIM/RBCC motif includes a RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger domain (R), one or two B-box domains (B), and a coiled-coil region (CC). The RING finger, which is present in most but not all TRIM proteins, is a cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain that confers E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (4Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. RING finger proteins: Mediators of ubiquitin ligase activity.Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). B-boxes, like the RING finger domain, are also zinc-binding motifs but with a less well-characterized function; they have been shown to regulate RING domain function, higher-order self-assembly, and substrate recognition (5Short K.M.

Virol. 2008; 82: 11495-11502Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The CC domain, on the other hand, is mainly involved in dimerization/oligomerization of TRIM proteins and in promoting the formation of high molecular weight complexes (7Reymond A. Meroni G.

A. 2014; 111: 2494-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region can contain one or more domains that appear to mediate the recognition of E3 ubiquitin ligase substrates and other targets (reviewed in (9Ozato K. Shin D.M. Chang T.H. Morse III, H.C. TRIM family proteins and their emerging roles in innate immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar)). The most common of these C-terminal domains is the B30.2, also referred to as the PRY-SPRY domain, which is present in at least 30 human TRIM family members as well as in other unrelated proteins (10Sardiello M. Cairo S. Fontanella B. Ballabio A. Meroni G. Genomic analysis of the TRIM family reveals two groups of genes with distinct evolutionary properties.BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 225Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11Perfetto L. Gherardini P.F. Davey N.E. Diella F. Helmer-Citterich M. Cesareni G. Exploring the diversity of SPRY/B30.2-mediated interactions.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 38-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Human TRIM7 is a 511-amino acid protein that displays the canonical TRIM/RBCC motif followed by a B30.2 C-terminal domain. It was first identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with glycogenin-1 (GN1), the autoglucosyltransferase responsible for the initiation of glycogen biosynthesis, and was therefore named GNIP1 (glycogen interacting protein isoform 1 (12Skurat A.V. Dietrich A.D. Zhai L. Roach P.J. GNIP, a novel protein that binds and activates glycogenin, the self-glucosylating initiator of glycogen biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19331-19338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). The TRIM7/GNIP1–glycogenin interaction was shown to be mediated by the B30.2 domain, whereas the CC domain was involved in the protein self-association (13Zhai L. Dietrich A. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. Structure–function analysis of GNIP, the glycogenin-interacting protein.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 421: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These studies also demonstrated that GNIP2, a spliced isoform of TRIM7/GNIP1 containing the B30.2 domain and a segment of the CC region, stimulates GN1 autoglucosylation in vitro almost 4-fold (12Skurat A.V. Dietrich A.D. Zhai L. Roach P.J. GNIP, a novel protein that binds and activates glycogenin, the self-glucosylating initiator of glycogen biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19331-19338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). TRIM7 has also been shown to be an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a key role in the c-Jun/AP-1 activation pathway via Ras, by mediating the ubiquitination of the c-Jun co-activator RACO-1, thus leading to its stabilization (14Chakraborty A. Diefenbacher M.E. Mylona A. Kassel O. Behrens A. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Trim7 mediates c-Jun/AP-1 activation by Ras signalling.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, TRIM7 depletion reduces c-Jun transcriptional activity, and its knockdown decreases the growth of xenograft lung tumors driven by Ras (14Chakraborty A. Diefenbacher M.E. Mylona A. Kassel O. Behrens A. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Trim7 mediates c-Jun/AP-1 activation by Ras signalling.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, increased TRIM7 expression levels that correlate with tumor size have been described in hepatocellular carcinoma patients, an effect that is related to the regulation of the p38 MAP-kinase pathway (15Hu X. Tang Z. Ma S. Yu Y. Chen X. Zang G. Tripartite motif-containing protein 7 regulates hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation via the DUSP6/p38 pathway.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2019; 511: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, new evidences also describe TRIM7 as a suppressor of hepatocellular carcinoma progression via inhibition of the Src-mTORC1-S6K1 axis (16Zhu L. Qin C. Li T. Ma X. Qiu Y. Lin Y. Ma D. Qin Z. Sun C. Shen X. Zhao Y. Han L. The E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM7 suppressed hepatocellular carcinoma progression by directly targeting Src protein.Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27: 1819-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). TRIM7 is also involved in osteosarcoma metastasis and chemoresistance regulation (17Zhou C. Zhang Z. Zhu X. Qian G. Zhou Y. Sun Y. Yu W. Wang J. Lu H. Lin F. Shen Z. Zheng S. N6-Methyladenosine modification of the TRIM7 positively regulates tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in osteosarcoma through ubiquitination of BRMS1.EBioMedicine. 2020; 59: 102955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Through the activation of c-Jun/AP-1 signaling pathway, TRIM7 also promotes proliferation and migration of atherosclerotic vascular smooth muscle cells (18Ji R. Gu Y. Zhang J. Gao C. Gao W. Zang X. Zhao Y. TRIM7 promotes proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis through activating c-Jun/AP-1.IUBMB Life. 2019; 72: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, TRIM7 exhibits in vitro autoubiquitination activity, which could be attributed to its RING finger/B-box domains, and promotes glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscle when overexpressed (19Montori-Grau M. Pedreira-Casahuga R. Boyer-Díaz Z. Lassot I. García-Martínez C. Orozco A. Cebrià J. Osorio-Conles O. Chacón M.R. Vendrell J. Vázquez-Carrera M. Desagher S. Jiménez-Chillarón J.C. Gómez-Foix A.M. GNIP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase is a novel player in regulating glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle.Metabolism. 2018; 83: 177-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The relationship, if any, between the glycogenic effect of TRIM7 and its potential role as a GN1 activator is not known. Recent studies have also revealed that TRIM7 ubiquitinates Zika virus envelope protein, thereby favoring the entry of the virus into host cells and pathogenesis (20Giraldo M.I. Xia H. Aguilera-Aguirre L. Hage A. van Tol S. Shan C. Xie X. Sturdevant G.L. Robertson S.J. McNally K.L. Meade-White K. Azar S.R. Rossi S.L. Maury W. Woodson M. et al.Envelope protein ubiquitination drives entry and pathogenesis of Zika virus.Nature. 2020; 585: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, TRIM7 has been shown to inhibit norovirus infection in human cells (21Orchard R.C. Sullender M.E. Dunlap B.F. Balce D.R. Doench J.G. Virgin H.W. Identification of antinorovirus genes in human cells using genome-wide CRISPR activation screening.J. Virol. 2019; 93e01324-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and the innate immune response against DNA virus through mediator of IRF3 activation ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation (22Yang B. Liu Y. Cui Y. Song D. Zhang G. Ma S. Liu Y. Chen M. Chen F. Wang H. Wang J. RNF90 negatively regulates cellular antiviral responses by targeting MITA for degradation.PLoS Pathog. 2020; 16e1008387Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, TRIM7 has an activating effect on the immune response mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 in macrophages (23Lu M. Zhu X. Yang Z. Zhang W. Sun Z. Ji Q. Chen X. Zhu J. Wang C. Nie S. E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif 7 positively regulates the TLR4-mediated immune response via its E3 ligase domain in macrophages.Mol. Immunol. 2019; 109: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As these evidences suggest, TRIM7 is emerging as a promising therapeutic target. In this context, its B30.2 domain may be particularly important because specificity determinants of many TRIM proteins lie in this domain (11Perfetto L. Gherardini P.F. Davey N.E. Diella F. Helmer-Citterich M. Cesareni G. Exploring the diversity of SPRY/B30.2-mediated interactions.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 38-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of action of TRIM7, we report here the X-ray crystal structure of its B30.2 domain, which constitutes the first structural study on this protein. We also define a putative binding interface in the TRIM7 B30.2 domain through the analysis of sequence conservation and assess the effect of different mutations on its interaction with GN1, the first protein identified as capable of interacting with this domain. The stability and dynamics of a docked complex between the TRIM7 B30.2 domain and the modeled structure of GN1 C-terminal peptide was further investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The structure of the human TRIM7 B30.2 domain (named as TRIM7B30.2 from now on; the same convention will be used in all other B30.2 domains) has been solved in two different crystal forms (Table 1) using the molecular replacement method with the structure of the Butyrophilin 3A1 (BTN3A1) B30.2 domain (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID 4N7I (24Sandstrom A. Peigné C.M. Léger A. Crooks J.E. Konczak F. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Bonneville M. Scotet E. Adams E.J.

Both crystal forms contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1A). Even though the packing of the molecules in the two crystal forms is different, the structure of the four independent molecules is very similar, showing backbone root mean square deviations (RMSD) smaller than 0.5 Å for all pairwise comparisons. The structure of chain A at the highest resolution (1.6 Å; PDB ID 6UMA) was used for the general description of TRIM7B30.2 and subsequent analysis.Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsCrystal grown by hanging drop method (PDB ID 6UMA)Crystal grown by sitting drop method (PDB ID 6UMB)Data collection Space groupP212121P212121a (Å)41.9462.36b (Å)62.0767.44c (Å)128.7685.69 Resolution range (Å)20.69–1.60 (1.63–1.60)50.42–1.80 (1.84–1.80) Observed reflections237,684193,627 Independent reflections44,09933,860 Rmerge (%)aRmerge = ΣhΣi | Iih – <Ih> |/ΣhΣi <Ih> where <Ih> is the mean intensity of the i observations of reflection h.4.2 (33.7)7.6 (54.6) I/σ (I)11.3 (1.7)10.7 (2.9) Completeness (%)97.6 (90.5)99.6 (97.8) Multiplicity5.4 (5.3)5.7 (5.9) CC1/20.999 (0.959)0.995 (0.917) Wilson B-factor20.918.5Refinement Reflections in refinement41,80432,144 Rcryst (%)bRcryst = Σ | |Fobs| - |Fcalc| |/Σ |Fobs| where |Fobs| and |Fcalc| are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively.

TRIM7B30.2 structure reveals the typical B30.2 domain fold consisting of two antiparallel β-sheets of seven (β1, β2, β4, β9, β10, β11, and β13) and six (β3, β5, β6, β7, β8, and β12) strands, arranged as a distorted β-sandwich (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, there is a short 310 helix (residues 428–430) located immediately before β6 strand. N- and C-terminal ends are close to each other in the seven-stranded β-sheet. This β-sheet (β-sheet B) forms a slightly convex surface at one side of the β-sandwich, whereas the six-stranded β-sheet (β-sheet A) forms a concave surface on the other side, which is partly covered by the two long loops that connect β2–β3 strands (loop 3) and β5 strand-310 helix (loop 6). The high structural similarity between the four molecules from the two crystal forms and the relatively low B-factor values for the residues of these loops suggest that their conformation is quite stable, most likely because of interactions (hydrogen bonds and to a lesser extent hydrophobic contacts) within and between one another and with residues from loops 1 and 12 and the β12 strand. Sequence homology and evolutionary studies indicate that the B30.2 domain is a fusion of two subdomains, named PRY and SPRY, forming a single structural module. According to the Pfam database assignment, in TRIM7B30.2, the PRY domain encompasses residues 344 to 392 (β1-β3 strands), whereas the SPRY domain includes residues 396 to 509 (β4-β13 strands) (Fig. 1C). A structural similarity search using the Dali server (25Holm L. Laakso L.M. Dali server update.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: W351-W355Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) revealed that the closest homolog to TRIM7B30.2 was BTN3A1B30.2 (PDB ID 4N7I, Z-score = 28.9, RMSD = 1.1 Å over 187 residues (24Sandstrom A. Peigné C.M. Léger A. Crooks J.E. Konczak F. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Bonneville M. Scotet E. Adams E.J.

Among human proteins, BTN3A1B30.2 also exhibits a high sequence similarity with TRIM7B30.2 showing 41.3% identity. The other top matches from the Dali server analysis were the B30.2 domains of mouse TRIM21 (PDB ID 3ZO0, Z-score = 28.1, RMSD = 1.3 Å (26Keeble A.H. Khan Z. Forster A. James L.C.

Despite its high structural and sequence similarity, unlike BTN3A1B30.2, which would be able to form dimers (24Sandstrom A. Peigné C.M. Léger A. Crooks J.E. Konczak F. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Bonneville M. Scotet E. Adams E.J.

A. 2017; 114: E7311-E7320Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), TRIM7B30.2 is monomeric both in solution on the basis of gel filtration chromatography (Fig. S1) and in the crystals, according to the quaternary assembly analysis with the PISA server (33Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6151) Google Scholar). In fact, the asymmetric unit of both crystal forms includes two molecules but in a different spatial arrangement (Fig. 1A). The structure of the full-length intracellular domain of BTN3A1 exhibits two potential dimer interfaces (32Gu S. Sachleben J.R. Boughter C.T. Nawrocka W.I. Borowska M.T. Tarrasch J.T. Skiniotis G. Roux B. Adams E.J. Phosphoantigen-induced conformational change of butyrophilin 3A1 (BTN3A1) and its implication on Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: E7311-E7320Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), one of which involves only the B30.2 domain. A possible explanation for the different quaternary structure of TRIM7B30.2 and BTN3A1B30.2 arises from the analysis of the conservation of the amino acids involved in the formation of the dimer of the latter (Fig. S2). This analysis shows that the residues that would contribute to the interaction from one of the protomers of the BTN3A1B30.2 dimer and their equivalent in TRIM7B30.2 have an identity of 35.7% and a similarity of 42.9%, whereas those from the second protomer are much less conserved (identity 0%, similarity 28.6%). Among the latter are Trp350, Tyr352, and Trp391 (equivalent to Thr382, Thr384, and Leu423 from TRIM7) which would be particularly important for the interaction because they participate in stable contacts as revealed by MD simulations (32Gu S. Sachleben J.R. Boughter C.T. Nawrocka W.I. Borowska M.T. Tarrasch J.T. Skiniotis G. Roux B. Adams E.J. Phosphoantigen-induced conformational change of butyrophilin 3A1 (BTN3A1) and its implication on Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: E7311-E7320Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). During the refinement process, additional electron densities connected to Cys378, Cys390, and Cys501 were observed in the Fobs-Fcalc map in both crystal forms (Fig. S3). As in the case of BTN3A1B30.2 (PDB ID 4N7I (24Sandstrom A. Peigné C.M. Léger A. Crooks J.E. Konczak F. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Bonneville M. Scotet E. Adams E.J. The intracellular B30.2 domain of butyrophilin 3A1 binds phosphoantigens to mediate activation of human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells.Immunity. 2014; 40: 490-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar)), the extra electron density was attributed to the modification of the cysteines by the β-mercaptoethanol present in the crystallization medium, yielding S,S-(2-hydroxyethyl)thiocysteine. Only Cys455, whose side chain points into the core of the β-sandwich, appears not to be modified according to the electron density maps. Because the main function of the B30.2 domains appears to be to mediate interactions with different targets, we sought to define the potential TRIM7B30.2 binding region by comparison with other B30.2 domain sequences and structures. Given the high structural homology between TRIM B30.2 domains, the conserved residues might be presumably important in determining the domains’ general conformation, whereas their different binding specificity would be related to differences in their sequences. In this respect, Song has described the existence of four regions in B30.2 domains that exhibit significant variations both in their length and in their amino acid composition (34Song B. Javanbakht H. Perron M. Park D.H. Stremlau M. Sodroski J. Retrovirus restriction by TRIM5alpha variants from Old World and New World primates.J.

Using a similar criterion, in an effort to identify potentially important residues for TRIM7B30.2 binding specificity, a multiple sequence alignment of 42 human B30.2 domain sequences (37 from TRIM family proteins and five from other proteins, including Butyrophilins) was performed using the program Clustal Omega (36Sievers F. Wilm A. Dineen D. Gibson T.J. Karplus K. Li W. Lopez R. McWilliam H. Remmert M. Söding J. Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Fast, scalable generation of high-quality protein multiple sequence alignments using Clustal Omega.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7: 539Crossref PubMed Scopus (7861) Google Scholar). The results were used to calculate the degree of conservation of each amino acid using the ConSurf server (37Ashkenazy H. Abadi S. Martz E. Chay O. Mayrose I. Pupko T. Ben-Tal N. ConSurf 2016: An improved methodology to estimate and visualize evolutionary conservation in macromolecules.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: W344-W350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar) (Fig. S4). Conservation scores were mapped onto the three-dimensional protein structure by the server using a representative coloring scheme (Fig. 3, A and B). The analysis revealed that most of the conserved residues are clustered on one face of the β-sandwich comprising β-sheet B and loops 1, 2, 4, 10, and 11 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the vast majority of the nonconserved residues map on the opposite side and are located on loops 3, 6, 7, 8, and 13 and the solvent-exposed region of β-sheet A. Invariant residues corresponding to β-strands 3, 5, 6, and 12 of β-sheet A are mostly hydrophobic, with their side chains buried at the interface between the β-sheets, and are covered by loop 6 and to a lesser extent by loop 3. Regions of high variability corresponding to six loops, most of them analogous to those found to be variable in TRIM7B30.2, have also been described as part of the binding interface in the structure of the TRIM21B30.2 in complex with IgG Fc (38James L.C.

Moreover, the face of TRIM7B30.2 on which variable residues are clustered matches with the canonical binding interface proposed from the analysis of TRIM21B30.2 (Fig. 4, A and B). TRIM21 residues Asp355, Trp381, Trp383, and Phe450 are essential for IgG Fc binding (38James L.C. Keeble A.H. Khan Z. Rhodes D.A. Trowsdale J.

https://openalex.org/W3162192582,"The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from expression data is a challenging problem in systems biology. The stochasticity or fluctuations in the biochemical processes that regulate the transcription process poses as one of the major challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel GRN inference approach, named the Probabilistic Extended Petri Net for Gene Regulatory Network (PEPN-GRN), for the inference of gene regulatory networks from noisy expression data. The proposed inference approach makes use of transition of discrete gene expression levels across adjacent time points as different evidence types that relate to the production or decay of genes. The paper examines three variants of the PEPN-GRN method, which mainly differ by the way the scores of network edges are computed using evidence types. The proposed method is evaluated on the benchmark DREAM4 in silico data sets and a real time series data set of E. coli from the DREAM5 challenge. The PEPN-GRN_v3 variant (the third variant of the PEPN-GRN approach) sought to learn the weights of evidence types in accordance with their contribution to the activation and inhibition gene regulation process. The learned weights help understand the time-shifted and inverted time-shifted relationship between regulator and target gene. Thus, PEPN-GRN_v3, along with the inference of network edges, also provides a functional understanding of the gene regulation process."
https://openalex.org/W3160505104,"Evidence of attentional atypicalities for faces in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are far from being confirmed. Using eye-tracking technology we compared space-based and object-based attention in children with, and without, a diagnosis of ASD. By capitalizing on Egly's paradigm, we presented two objects (2 faces and their phase-scrambled equivalent) and cued a location in one of the two objects. Then, a target appeared at the same location as the cue (Valid condition), or at a different location within the same object (Same Object condition), or at a different location in another object (Different Object condition). The attentional benefit/cost in terms of time for target detection in each of the three conditions was computed. The findings revealed that target detection was always faster in the valid condition than in the invalid condition, regardless of the type of stimulus and the group of children. Thus, no difference emerged between the two groups in terms of space-based attention. Conversely the two groups differed in object-based attention. Children without a diagnosis of ASD showed attentional shift cost with phase-scrambled stimuli, but not with faces. Instead, children with a diagnosis of ASD deployed similar attentional strategies to focus on faces and their phase-scrambled version."

The presence of bilateral subclavian, innominate or superior vena cava obstruction is a major limitation to device revision and/or upgrade.This is retrospective study of patients who underwent laser-assisted lead extraction (LLE) (GlideLight laser sheath, Spectranetics Corporation, Colorado Springs, USA) with lead revision or upgrade using the laser sheath as a guide rail. Patients with known occlusion, severe stenosis or functional obstruction of the venous access vessels with indwelling leads were included in this study.106 patients underwent percutaneous LLE with lead revision and/or upgrade. Preoperative known complete occlusion or severe stenosis of access veins was present in 23 patients (21.5%). More patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) underwent LLE (64.1%) than patients with CRT-Ds (24.5%) and pacemaker patients (11.3%). In total 172 leads were extracted: 79 (45.9%) single-coil defibrillator leads, 35 (20.3%) dual-coil defibrillator leads, 31 (18.0%) right atrial leads, 24 (13.9%) right ventricular leads and three (1.7%) malfunctional coronary sinus left ventricular pacing leads. The mean age of leads was 99.2±65.6 months. The implantation of new leads after crossing the venous stenosis/obstruction was successful in 98 (92.4%) cases. Postoperative complications were pocket hematoma in two cases and wound infection in one case. No peri-operative and no immediate postoperative death was recorded. One intraoperative superior vena cava tear was treated by immediate thoracotomy and surgical repair.In a single-center study on LLE in the presence of supra-cardiac occlusion of the central veins for CIED lead upgrade and revision we could demonstrate a low procedural complication rate with no procedural deaths. Most of the leads could be completely extracted to revise or upgrade the system. Our study showed a low complication rate, with acceptable mortality rates."

Here, 16S rRNA sequencing-based fecal microbiota profiles of 18–24 month old Indian children were evaluated (n = 41), in relation to their anthropometric parameters, intestinal permeability, body composition and total energy expenditure. Pathway analyses were conducted to assess microbial functions related to stunting, underweight and wasting. The fecal microbiota was enriched in Prevotella 9 , Bifidobacterium and Escherichia-Shigella . Weight, weight-for-age Z-scores (WAZ) and weight-for-length Z-scores (WLZ), along with age, acted as covariates of microbiota variation specifically in boys (n = 23). Bifidobacterium longum subsp longum abundance was positively associated with WAZ while Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium breve abundances were negatively associated with age. The lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway was upregulated in stunted (n = 16) and wasted (n = 8) children. Findings from this study indicate that child sex may be a critical modifier of the role of gut microbiota on childhood growth."

However, the role of Nrg4 in human NAFLD remains unclear to date. We analysed Nrg4 plasma levels and its association with liver disease severity together with the transcriptional profile of the Nrg4 pathway in liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of NAFLD patients.Plasma Nrg4 levels were measured in 65 NAFLD patients and 43 healthy controls (HC). Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis were diagnosed and quantified with chemical shift MRI and transient elastography respectively. Furthermore, blood lipid levels, HOMA-IR and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IFN-γ) were analysed. Microarray analyses to assess differences in the Nrg4 and its receptor family ErbB pathway in liver and VAT from an independent patient group with biopsy proven NAFL (simple steatosis) (n = 4), NASH (n = 5) and normal liver (n = 6) were performed.Plasma Nrg4 levels were not significantly different between NAFLD patients and HC (p = 0.622). Furthermore, plasma Nrg4 levels did not correlate with the hepatic fat fraction (r = -0.028, p = 0.829) and were not significantly different between NAFLD patients with or without hepatic fibrosis (p = 0.087). Finally, the expression profile of 82 genes related to the Nrg4-ErbB pathway in liver and VAT was not significantly different between NAFL, NASH or obese controls.Our study does not support a role for Nrg4 in the pathophysiology of human NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W3162267040,"This study evaluated the adherence to prescribed cardiovascular therapy medications among cardiovascular disease patients attending clinics in Misan, Amara, Iraq. Mixed methods were used to assess medication adherence comprising the Arabic version of the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) and determination of drug concentrations in patient dried blood spot (DBS) samples by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. Three hundred and three Iraqi patients (median age 53 years, 50.5% female) who had been taking one or more of the nine commonly prescribed cardiovascular medications (amlodipine, atenolol, atorvastatin, bisoprolol, diltiazem, lisinopril, losartan, simvastatin and valsartan) for at least six months were enrolled. For each patient MMAS-8 scores were determined alongside drug concentrations in their dried blood spot samples. Results from the standardized questionnaire showed that adherence was 81.8% in comparison with 50.8% obtained using the laboratory-based microsample analysis. The agreement between the indirect (MMAS-8) and direct (DBS analysis) assessment approaches to assessing medication adherence showed significantly poor agreement (kappa = 0.28, P = 0.001). The indirect and direct assessment approaches showed no significant correlation between nonadherence to prescribed cardiovascular pharmacotherapy and age and gender, but were significantly associated with the number of medications in the patient's treatment regimen (MMAS-8: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.947, 95% CI, P = 0.001; DBS analysis: OR 2.164, 95% CI, P = 0.001). The MMAS-8 results highlighted reasons for nonadherence to prescribed cardiovascular pharmacotherapy in this patient population whilst the objective DBS analysis approach gave valuable information about nonadherence to each medication in the patient's treatment regimen. DBS sampling, due its minimally invasive nature, convenience and ease of transport is a useful alternative matrix to monitor adherence objectively in Iraq to cardiovascular pharmacotherapy. This information combined with MMAS-8 can provide clinicians with an evidence-based novel approach to implement intervention strategies to optimise and personalise cardiovascular pharmacotherapy in the Iraqi population and thereby improve patient health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3163810448,"Although low birth weight in Japan has slightly increased over the past several decades, the association between maternal birth weight and pregnancy outcomes remains poorly understood.In this hospital-based, prospective cohort study conducted at the National Center for Child Health and Development, we obtained information on pregnant women's birth weight via their maternal and child health handbook. We analyzed 944 women born at term after dividing them into five categories according to their birth weight: <2500 g, 2500-2999 g, 3000-3499 g, 3500-3999 g, and ≥4000 g. Multivariate logistic regression analysis and trend analysis were used to elucidate the extent to which maternal birth weight was associated with small-for-gestational-age and low birth weight in offspring, as well as with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.Compared with women with a birth weight of 3000-3499 g, those born with a birth weight <2500 g had a significantly higher risk of low birth weight (adjusted odds ratio: 5.39, 95% confidence interval: 2.06-14.1) and small-for-gestational-age (adjusted odds ratio: 9.11, 95% confidence interval: 3.14-26.4) infants. No significant association was found between the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preterm birth. A linear relationship was observed between the lower birth weight categories and a higher risk of low birth weight and small-for-gestational-age (p-values for trends: 0.009 and <0.001, respectively), but no linear relationship was observed for the risk of preterm birth and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (p-value for trends: 0.317 and 0.157, respectively).Our findings suggest that lower maternal birth weight is associated with small-for-gestational-age and low birth weight in offspring of women born at term."

In this issue of Cell, Washington et al. and Alpert et al. demonstrate the value of genomic surveillance when studying the introduction of the B.1.1.7 variant to the US and illustrate the challenge that results from the lack of good sampling strategies. In late 2020, scientists in the United Kingdom studying the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic noticed something unusual. In the southeast region of Kent, there was a sudden uptick in the number of samples of a particular lineage—separate infections without known links or shared exposures that nevertheless had extremely closely related genomes suggestive of being proximal infections in a relatively short transmission chain. Moreover, the mutations that defined the lineage included several that had been independently implicated in changing the properties of the virus for the worse (from a human perspective), here all together in one tidy package. Over the next few weeks, frantic efforts to define the characteristics of this “variant” confirmed that it was a serious event in the evolution of the pandemic, more transmissible and virulent, and we now know it as the “variant of concern” B.1.1.7 (Volz et al., 2021Volz E. Mishra S. Chand M. Barrett J.C. Johnson R. Geidelberg L. Hinsley W.R. Laydon D.J. Dabrera G.

At the time of writing a few months later, B.1.1.7 is now the dominant lineage in the country and likely to be at least partially responsible for spiking infections from Michigan to Florida (CDC, 2021aCDCCOVID Data Tracker - Variant Proportions.2021https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportionsGoogle Scholar). Though both handle it cautiously and candidly, a common challenge for these two papers is that when B.1.1.7 was making landfall and becoming established in the US, genomic data from COVID cases in this country was very limited and efforts to collect it were unevenly distributed. Globally, it is hard to overstate how different the UK’s genomic surveillance program is from that of other nations, but the comparison with the US is instructive. As described in Alpert et al., 2021Alpert T. Brito A.F. Lasek-Nesselquist E. Rothman J. Valesano A.L. MacKay M.J. Petrone M.E. Breban M.I. Watkins A.E.

In contrast, the sequencing effort that allowed the emergence of B.1.1.7 in Kent to be detected covered around 5% of all positive cases (Vavrek et al., 2021Vavrek D. Speroni L. Curnow K.J. Oberholzer M. Moeder V. Febbo P.G.

Genomic surveillance is valuable, whether to detect variants or to infer or rule out transmission across scales (Figure 1A). But how can we manage national surveillance for an infectious disease when some places are not looking as hard as others? One possible work-around used by Washington et al., 2021Washington N.L. Gangavarapu K. Zeller M. Bolze A. Cirulli E.T. Schiabor Barrett K.M. Larsen B.B. Anderson C. White S. Cassens T. et al.Emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States.Cell. 2021; 184 (this issue): 2587-2594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar is to sequence a fraction of samples from commercial test providers. This is smart but imperfect as the resulting surveillance will be good in the places where that test is widely used and poor where it isn’t. Multiple cooperating commercial labs will do a lot to help this. Nevertheless, while sequencing truly random samples from commercial labs will provide a better estimate of the rise of known variants than an ad hoc alternative, or preferential sequencing of clusters of transmission (e.g., long-term care facilities), it is still not a substitute for a national strategy. The challenge is not only to sequence more but to collect appropriate metadata, like date of sampling or epidemiologic and clinical features of infection, because without it, genomes are reduced to a much less useful string of As, Cs, Gs, and Ts (and Ns). This, like sequencing, is easier said than done for a nation of diverse states with different attitudes toward an investment in public health (Maxmen, 2021Maxmen A. Why US coronavirus tracking can’t keep up with concerning variants.Nature. 2021; 592: 336-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the scientific community should also give fair credit to those who contribute sequence and other data to the public databases that make work of this sort possible. This is a truly valuable contribution that too often goes unrecognized and unrewarded by grant-making bodies and promotion committees. Researchers must be motivated to share data openly and in a timely fashion; perverse incentives that stand in the way of sharing data could literally cost lives. It is the nature of things that during a pandemic of this kind, events overtake the patient collection of evidence and publication. This work documenting the introduction of B.1.1.7 to the US is being published when B.1.1.7 has already been acknowledged as the dominant lineage there. The significance is not limited to the findings of the papers but in demonstrating what can be done provided data are promptly available to inform policy and encourage future research. The issue of prompt reporting is shown clearly if we compare the lag time between samples being collected and submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID, 2021GISAID, (2021). GISAID - hCov19 Variants Surveillance Data. Accessed April 16, 2021. https://www.gisaid.org/hcov19-variants/.Google Scholar) in the US and the UK (Figure 1B, median days of submission delay: 37 days in the US versus 19 days in the UK). Even had the US been sequencing as rigorously as the UK, such a lag in submissions would delay the detection of variants. This is an ongoing concern. Lack of sampling strategies, limited sequencing, and delays in genomic surveillance continue to hinder detection of other emerging variants. B.1.1.7 has been joined by emerging variants of concern B.1.351 and P.1, the last responsible for a concerning surge of cases in a population thought to have high levels of prior immunity from previous infection (Sabino et al., 2021Sabino E.C. Buss L.F. Carvalho M.P.S. Prete Jr., C.A. Crispim M.A.E. Fraiji N.A. Pereira R.H.M. Parag K.V. da Silva Peixoto P.

Of these three, P.1 has recently been introduced to the US and is apparently rapidly becoming established in states including Illinois, Florida, and Massachusetts (CDC, 2021bCDCSARS-CoV-2 Variant Classifications and Definitions - Variants of Concern.2021https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/variant-surveillance/variant-info.htmlGoogle Scholar). Prompt reporting of genomic data is crucial to determining the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this variant. Other variants continue to emerge. B.1.427/1.429 has recently been designated by CDC as “of concern,” and multiple lineages that are descended from or closely related to B.1.526 merit close attention (CDC, 2021bCDCSARS-CoV-2 Variant Classifications and Definitions - Variants of Concern.2021https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/variant-surveillance/variant-info.htmlGoogle Scholar). This is not only an issue for the United States. Recently screening revealed three travelers arriving from Tanzania into Angola infected with another “variant” that is more divergent than any yet reported (de Oliveira et al., 2021de Oliveira T. Lutucuta S. Nkengasong J. Morais J. Paixão J.P. Neto Z. Afonso P. Miranda J. David K.

Surveillance might not seem the most exciting of topics, but it determines our ability to know almost anything about the status of the pandemic. This is reflected by the $1.7 billion investment in genomic epidemiology announced by the White House on the 16th of April (The White House, 2021The White HouseFact Sheet: Biden Administration Announces $1.7 Billion Investment to Fight COVID-19 Variants | The White House.2021https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/16/fact-sheet-biden-administration-announces-1-7-billion-investment-to-fight-covid-19-variants/Google Scholar), which will hopefully jumpstart programs across the country and mitigate the patchy sampling we have described here, even if it will take time and effort.

https://openalex.org/W3162204751,"Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of eyedrop instillation failure and its related physical and visual function factors among glaucoma patients who used hypotensive eyedrops daily. Subjects and methods Patients with a history of self-instillation of one or more ocular hypotensive ophthalmic solutions for six or more months were enrolled. Definitions of instillation failure were eyedrop instillation other than on the eye surface; eyedrop contact with eyelashes; eyedrop bottle tip contact with the eyelashes, eye surface or ocular adnexa; or two or more drops instilled with one instillation trial. To clarify factors related to instillation failure, we used visual function tests and investigated cervical spine extension angles during instillation, pinching strength, physical ataxia (evaluated using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia), motor dysfunction of the upper limbs (evaluated using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire), and vision quality (evaluated using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25). Results Of 103 total subjects, 61.2% satisfied the definition of instillation failure. Instillation of the eyedrop other than at the cul-desac (76.2%) was the most frequent reason for failure, followed by contact of the tip of the eyedrop bottle (22.2%) and instillation of the same or more than two eyedrops in a single attempt (11.1%). Advanced age, a shallow cervical spine extension angle, weak pinching strength, poor motor dysfunction of the upper limbs, the degree of ataxia, poor best-corrected visual acuity, and visual field scores were significant risk factors for instillation failure. Vision quality may have some relation to instillation failure. Conclusion It is highly recommended that instillation failure be routinely investigated even among patients with adequate experience using eyedrops and that correct therapies are chosen in a patient-based fashion."

However, it is difficult for clinicians to judge the running pattern with high reproducibility. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare the degree of concordance of the running pattern of the choroidal vessels between that determined by artificial intelligence (AI) to that determined by experienced clinicians.The running pattern of the choroidal vessels in en face images of Haller's layer of 413 normal and pachychoroid diseased eyes was classified as symmetrical or asymmetrical by human raters and by three supervised machine learning models; the support vector machine (SVM), Xception, and random forest models. The data from the human raters were used as the supervised data. The accuracy rates of the human raters and the certainty of AI's answers were compared using confidence scores (CSs).The choroidal vascular running pattern could be determined by each AI model with an area under the curve better than 0.94. The random forest method was able to discriminate with the highest accuracy among the three AIs. In the CS analyses, the percentage of certainty was highest (66.4%) and that of uncertainty was lowest (6.1%) in the agreement group. On the other hand, the rate of uncertainty was highest (27.3%) in the disagreement group.AI algorithm can automatically classify with ambiguous criteria the presence or absence of a symmetrical blood vessel running pattern of the choroid. The classification was as good as that of supervised humans in accuracy and reproducibility."
https://openalex.org/W3172817606,"RNA polymerase II (Pol II) surveils the genome, pausing as it encounters DNA lesions and base modifications and initiating signals for DNA repair among other important regulatory events. Recent work suggests that Pol II pauses at 5-carboxycytosine (5caC), an epigenetic modification of cytosine, because of a specific hydrogen bond between the carboxyl group of 5caC and a specific residue in fork loop 3 of Pol II. This hydrogen bond compromises productive NTP binding and slows down elongation. Apart from this specific interaction, the carboxyl group of 5caC can potentially interact with numerous charged residues in the cleft of Pol II. However, it is not clear how other interactions between Pol II and 5caC contribute to pausing. In this study, we use Markov state models (a type of kinetic network models) built from extensive molecular dynamics simulations to comprehensively study the impact of 5caC on Pol II translocation. We describe two translocation intermediates with specific interactions that prevent the template base from loading into the Pol II active site. In addition to the previously observed state with 5caC constrained by fork loop 3, we discovered a new intermediate state with a hydrogen bond between 5caC and fork loop 2. Surprisingly, we find that 5caC may curb translocation by suppressing kinking of the helix bordering the active site (the bridge helix) because its high flexibility is critical to translocation. Our work provides new insights into how epigenetic modifications of genomic DNA can modulate Pol II translocation, inducing pauses in transcription."
