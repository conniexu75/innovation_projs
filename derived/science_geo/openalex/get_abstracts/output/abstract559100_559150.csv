https://openalex.org/W2344657883,"We analysed whole-genome sequences of 560 breast cancers to advance understanding of the driver mutations conferring clonal advantage and the mutational processes generating somatic mutations. We found that 93 protein-coding cancer genes carried probable driver mutations. Some non-coding regions exhibited high mutation frequencies, but most have distinctive structural features probably causing elevated mutation rates and do not contain driver mutations. Mutational signature analysis was extended to genome rearrangements and revealed twelve base substitution and six rearrangement signatures. Three rearrangement signatures, characterized by tandem duplications or deletions, appear associated with defective homologous-recombination-based DNA repair: one with deficient BRCA1 function, another with deficient BRCA1 or BRCA2 function, the cause of the third is unknown. This analysis of all classes of somatic mutation across exons, introns and intergenic regions highlights the repertoire of cancer genes and mutational processes operating, and progresses towards a comprehensive account of the somatic genetic basis of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2343190161,"Star-like objects with effective temperatures of less than 2,700 kelvin are referred to as ultracool dwarfs. This heterogeneous group includes stars of extremely low mass as well as brown dwarfs (substellar objects not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion), and represents about 15 per cent of the population of astronomical objects near the Sun. Core-accretion theory predicts that, given the small masses of these ultracool dwarfs, and the small sizes of their protoplanetary disk, there should be a large but hitherto undetected population of terrestrial planets orbiting them - ranging from metal-rich Mercury-sized planets to more hospitable volatile-rich Earth-sized planets. Here we report observations of three short-period Earth-sized planets transiting an ultracool dwarf star only 12 parsecs away. The inner two planets receive four times and two times the irradiation of Earth, respectively, placing them close to the inner edge of the habitable zone of the star. Our data suggest that 11 orbits remain possible for the third planet, the most likely resulting in irradiation significantly less than that received by Earth. The infrared brightness of the host star, combined with its Jupiter-like size, offers the possibility of thoroughly characterizing the components of this nearby planetary system."
https://openalex.org/W2345862122,"There is great interest in the restoration and conservation of coastal habitats for protection from flooding and erosion. This is evidenced by the growing number of analyses and reviews of the effectiveness of habitats as natural defences and increasing funding world-wide for nature-based defences–i.e. restoration projects aimed at coastal protection; yet, there is no synthetic information on what kinds of projects are effective and cost effective for this purpose. This paper addresses two issues critical for designing restoration projects for coastal protection: (i) a synthesis of the costs and benefits of projects designed for coastal protection (nature-based defences) and (ii) analyses of the effectiveness of coastal habitats (natural defences) in reducing wave heights and the biophysical parameters that influence this effectiveness. We (i) analyse data from sixty-nine field measurements in coastal habitats globally and examine measures of effectiveness of mangroves, salt-marshes, coral reefs and seagrass/kelp beds for wave height reduction; (ii) synthesise the costs and coastal protection benefits of fifty-two nature-based defence projects and; (iii) estimate the benefits of each restoration project by combining information on restoration costs with data from nearby field measurements. The analyses of field measurements show that coastal habitats have significant potential for reducing wave heights that varies by habitat and site. In general, coral reefs and salt-marshes have the highest overall potential. Habitat effectiveness is influenced by: a) the ratios of wave height-to-water depth and habitat width-to-wavelength in coral reefs; and b) the ratio of vegetation height-to-water depth in salt-marshes. The comparison of costs of nature-based defence projects and engineering structures show that salt-marshes and mangroves can be two to five times cheaper than a submerged breakwater for wave heights up to half a metre and, within their limits, become more cost effective at greater depths. Nature-based defence projects also report benefits ranging from reductions in storm damage to reductions in coastal structure costs."
https://openalex.org/W2344275832,"Activity in the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways can bidirectionally control the speed of movements that underlie reward-seeking actions in mice without affecting motivation. Activity in the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways, respectively, promotes actions associated with reward and suppresses actions that do not lead to reward. Eric Yttri and Joshua Dudman now show that in addition to their role in selecting the action that will lead to reward, these pathways are also involved in the modification of the velocity of movements required to obtain the reward. Through optogenetic stimulation of the direct or indirect pathway during voluntary movement, the authors show that each pathway can produce both a learned increase and a learned decrease in the speed of specific movements, without affecting motivation, and in a dopamine-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that each pathway can reinforce the speed of movements that underlie reward-seeking actions. For goal-directed behaviour it is critical that we can both select the appropriate action and learn to modify the underlying movements (for example, the pitch of a note or velocity of a reach) to improve outcomes. The basal ganglia are a critical nexus where circuits necessary for the production of behaviour, such as the neocortex and thalamus, are integrated with reward signalling1 to reinforce successful, purposive actions2. The dorsal striatum, a major input structure of basal ganglia, is composed of two opponent pathways, direct and indirect, thought to select actions that elicit positive outcomes and suppress actions that do not, respectively3,4. Activity-dependent plasticity modulated by reward is thought to be sufficient for selecting actions in the striatum5,6. Although perturbations of basal ganglia function produce profound changes in movement7, it remains unknown whether activity-dependent plasticity is sufficient to produce learned changes in movement kinematics, such as velocity. Here we use cell-type-specific stimulation in mice delivered in closed loop during movement to demonstrate that activity in either the direct or indirect pathway is sufficient to produce specific and sustained increases or decreases in velocity, without affecting action selection or motivation. These behavioural changes were a form of learning that accumulated over trials, persisted after the cessation of stimulation, and were abolished in the presence of dopamine antagonists. Our results reveal that the direct and indirect pathways can each bidirectionally control movement velocity, demonstrating unprecedented specificity and flexibility in the control of volition by the basal ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W2345410714,"Sequence variants affecting blood lipids and coronary artery disease (CAD) may enhance understanding of the atherogenicity of lipid fractions. Using a large resource of whole-genome sequence data, we examined rare and low-frequency variants for association with non-HDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in up to 119,146 Icelanders. We discovered 13 variants with large effects (within ANGPTL3, APOB, ABCA1, NR1H3, APOA1, LIPC, CETP, LDLR, and APOC1) and replicated 14 variants. Five variants within PCSK9, APOA1, ANGPTL4, and LDLR associate with CAD (33,090 cases and 236,254 controls). We used genetic risk scores for the lipid fractions to examine their causal relationship with CAD. The non-HDL cholesterol genetic risk score associates most strongly with CAD (P = 2.7 × 10(-28)), and no other genetic risk score associates with CAD after accounting for non-HDL cholesterol. The genetic risk score for non-HDL cholesterol confers CAD risk beyond that of LDL cholesterol (P = 5.5 × 10(-8)), suggesting that targeting atherogenic remnant cholesterol may reduce cardiovascular risk."

https://openalex.org/W2343219805,"The physiology of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is fundamental to brain development and function. NMDA receptors are ionotropic glutamate receptors that function as heterotetramers composed mainly of GluN1 and GluN2 subunits. Activation of NMDA receptors requires binding of neurotransmitter agonists to a ligand-binding domain (LBD) and structural rearrangement of an amino-terminal domain (ATD). Recent crystal structures of GluN1-GluN2B NMDA receptors bound to agonists and an allosteric inhibitor, ifenprodil, represent the allosterically inhibited state. However, how the ATD and LBD move to activate the NMDA receptor ion channel remains unclear. Here we applied X-ray crystallography, single-particle electron cryomicroscopy and electrophysiology to rat NMDA receptors to show that, in the absence of ifenprodil, the bi-lobed structure of GluN2 ATD adopts an open conformation accompanied by rearrangement of the GluN1-GluN2 ATD heterodimeric interface, altering subunit orientation in the ATD and LBD and forming an active receptor conformation that gates the ion channel."
https://openalex.org/W2345827275,"Conditional expression of the most common somatic gain-of-function Ezh2 mutation in mouse models of melanoma and lymphoma reveals insight into its cooperation with other oncogenic events and its effects on the epigenome. B cell lymphoma and melanoma harbor recurrent mutations in the gene encoding the EZH2 histone methyltransferase (EZH2), but the carcinogenic role of these mutations is unclear. Here we describe a mouse model in which the most common somatic Ezh2 gain-of-function mutation (EZH2Y646F in human; Ezh2Y641F in mouse) is conditionally expressed. Expression of Ezh2Y641F in mouse B cells or melanocytes caused high-penetrance lymphoma or melanoma, respectively. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2, but not the oncoprotein Myc, or loss of the tumor suppressor protein p53 (encoded by Trp53 in mice) further accelerated lymphoma progression. Expression of the mutant Braf but not the mutant Nras oncoprotein further accelerated melanoma progression. Although expression of Ezh2Y641F globally increased the abundance of trimethylated Lys27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), it also caused a widespread redistribution of this repressive mark, including a loss of H3K27me3 that was associated with increased transcription at many loci. These results suggest that Ezh2Y641F induces lymphoma and melanoma through a vast reorganization of chromatin structure, inducing both repression and activation of polycomb-regulated loci."

https://openalex.org/W2346657728,"The authors show that a gene expression switch operated by microRNAs regulates the control of puberty onset and adult fertility by the CNS by triggering increased hypothalamic Gnrh mRNA expression during the infantile period of postnatal development. A sparse population of a few hundred primarily hypothalamic neurons forms the hub of a complex neuroglial network that controls reproduction in mammals by secreting the 'master molecule' gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Timely postnatal changes in GnRH expression are essential for puberty and adult fertility. Here we report that a multilayered microRNA-operated switch with built-in feedback governs increased GnRH expression during the infantile-to-juvenile transition and that impairing microRNA synthesis in GnRH neurons leads to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and infertility in mice. Two essential components of this switch, miR-200 and miR-155, respectively regulate Zeb1, a repressor of Gnrh transcriptional activators and Gnrh itself, and Cebpb, a nitric oxide–mediated repressor of Gnrh that acts both directly and through Zeb1, in GnRH neurons. This alteration in the delicate balance between inductive and repressive signals induces the normal GnRH-fuelled run-up to correct puberty initiation, and interfering with this process disrupts the neuroendocrine control of reproduction."

Those exogenous pioneer TFs overexpressed in the fibroblasts directly recognize specific loci across the genome and recruit and orchestrate with other transcriptional regulators to remodel the epigenome of the host cells and eventually establish the NSC identity. This reprogramming strategy may ultimately provide an avenue to patient-specific cell-based or in situ regenerative therapy. Compared to the genetic approach, small-molecule-based chemical strategies may have several important advantages (Xu et al., 2013Xu T. Zhang M. Laurent T. Xie M. Ding S.

Principles of Developmental Genetics. Second Edition. Academic Press, 2014: 59-76Google Scholar). Small molecules are relatively easy to apply, optimize, and manufacture, and they can be more readily developed into conventional pharmaceuticals. Unlike the reprogramming mediated by pioneer TFs, chemical-induced cellular reprogramming represents a different process. Mechanistically, small molecules interact with and modulate endogenously pre-existing proteins of the starting cell type (e.g., fibroblasts), and indirectly and ultimately gain and establish target cell type specificity. Therefore, chemical reprogramming would provide a novel approach and process to investigate the underlying mechanism of cell fate conversion. A previous study reported a chemical cocktail that induced fibroblasts into neural progenitor cells under hypoxia conditions (Cheng et al., 2014Cheng L. Hu W. Qiu B. Zhao J. Yu Y. Guan W. Wang M. Yang W. Pei G. Generation of neural progenitor cells by chemical cocktails and hypoxia.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 665-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Not only does the mechanism underlying such reprogramming remain elusive, but also most previous studies of NSC reprogramming started with undefined mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Cheng et al., 2014Cheng L.

MEFs are an inherently heterogeneous population containing non-fibroblast precursor cell types that may be specified into neural lineage via processes other than bona fide reprogramming. To unambiguously define the origin of cells that are reprogrammed into NSCs, genetic lineage tracing of the starting fibroblasts would be required (Cassady et al., 2014Cassady J.P. D’Alessio A.C. Sarkar S. Dani V.S. Fan Z.P. Ganz K. Roessler R. Sur M. Young R.A. Jaenisch R. Direct lineage conversion of adult mouse liver cells and B lymphocytes to neural stem cells.Stem Cell Reports. 2014; 3: 948-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), especially in conditions that use combinations of small molecules given the indirect induction mechanisms of reprogramming and differentiation. To this end, using purified MEFs that were genetically labeled with tdTomato via a validated fibroblast-specific Fsp1-Cre lineage tracing system, we rationally screened combinations of small molecules and identified a specific combination of nine components (M9) that could efficiently convert the fibroblasts into chemical-induced NSC-like cells (ciNSLCs). The resulting ciNSLCs are tripotent and can robustly differentiate into three neural lineages, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and functional neurons. Moreover, ciNSLCs have gene expression profiles and self-renewal abilities very similar to primary NSCs. Initial mechanistic studies further uncovered how fibroblasts are gradually and specifically reprogrammed toward an NSC fate via activation of endogenous Sox2. Our study provides not only a completely chemically defined approach to generating NSCs from fibroblasts but also molecular insights into the chemical-induced neural reprogramming process. Because primary MEFs contain heterogeneous populations of non-fibroblast precursor cells, it is essential to unambiguously define the origin and identity of the starting fibroblasts for chemical-based reprogramming with a genetic lineage tracing strategy. Fibroblast-specific protein 1 (Fsp1; also known as S100α4) has been shown and validated as a specific marker for fibroblasts, and Fsp1-Cre has been used to lineage-trace fibroblast origin (Qian et al., 2012Qian L. Huang Y. Spencer C.I. Foley A. Vedantham V. Liu L. Conway S.J. Fu J.D. Srivastava D. In vivo reprogramming of murine cardiac fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes.Nature. 2012; 485: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Consequently, cells were isolated from transgenic mice carrying Fsp1-Cre/ROSA26tdTomato at E13.5, and the fibroblast population was permanently marked with tdTomato expression. Besides removing neural tissues from the MEF preparations, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to collect the tdTomato+/p75− population to exclude any neural crest progenitors (hereafter named tdMEF; Figures 1A and S1A). These tdMEFs were negative for typical NSC markers, including Sox2, Pax6, and Olig2 (Figure S1B; Table S1). They showed a very low level of Nestin expression, but the pattern was quite different from that of primary NSCs (Figure S1B). In addition, tdMEFs were negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neural/glial antigen 2 (NG2), markers for astrocytes/radial glia cells and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, respectively, that have the potential to become NSCs (Figure S1B) (Doetsch et al., 1999Doetsch F.

Raff M. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells reprogrammed to become multipotential CNS stem cells.Science. 2000; 289: 1754-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). We confirmed the absence of several neural gene transcripts, including Pax6, Sox2, Hes5, Ascl1, Gfap, and Olig2, in tdMEFs by RT-PCR (Figure S1C; Table S2). To further confirm the absence of neuron-producing cells, tdMEFs were cultured under extended neuronal differentiation condition. No Tuj1+ neurons were detected from 105 starting tdMEFs after a 15-day differentiation (data not shown). Consequently, these tdMEFs were established as suitable starting cells for chemical-based neural reprogramming studies. We hypothesized that treating cells with a combination of small molecules that target epigenetic modifications and modulate neuro-developmental signaling would induce the neural transcriptional program in fibroblasts.

Briefly, tdMEFs were plated at 15,000 cells per well in a 24-well plate. After overnight culture, tdMEFs were treated in neural reprogramming basal medium with addition of individual small molecules from a focused chemical collection, including epigenetic modifiers, metabolism regulators, and signaling modulators. Ten days post-treatment, cells were fixed, immuno-stained, and analyzed for co-expression of Sox2 and Nestin, two typical NSC markers (Figures 1A and 1B). From the primary screening, Hh-Ag 1.5 (Hh; a potent Smo agonist) and retinoic acid (RA) were found to induce the generation of 3.68% and 1.26% Sox2+/Nestin+ cells, respectively, while DMSO treated control wells had no Sox2+/Nestin+ cells. These two chemicals were subsequently included into the basal condition, and small molecules were screened again on top of the six-molecule condition for ones that could further improve the neural induction efficiency. Notably, RG108 (RG; a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor), Parnate (Par; a histone demethylase inhibitor), and SMER28 (SR; an autophagy modulator) further enhanced the generation of Sox2+/Nestin+ cells. Particularly, addition of SR improved the conversion efficiency for adult tail-tip fibroblasts. These three small molecules were included into the neural induction cocktail, resulting in a nine-component combination of CHIR, LDN, A83, RA, Hh, RG, Par, SR, and bFGF (Table S3), that robustly induced Sox2+/Nestin+ cells at∼24.20%–30.04% (Figure 1F). To identify indispensible molecules, each component was individually removed from the cocktail and the neural reprogramming efficiency was evaluated. Removing any of the nine components significantly reduced the reprogramming efficiency (Figure S1D). This combination of nine components (named M9 hereafter) was used in subsequent assays after optimization of dosage (Figure S1E). To characterize the reprogramming process, it was observed that the M9-treated tdMEFs morphologically underwent a characteristic mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), and small cell colonies gradually emerged toward day 6 (Figure S1F). These METed colonies were positive for alkaline phosphatase (ALP; Figure S1G). Remarkably, during days 6–10, induction of the Sox2, the master transcriptional factor for NSCs, was observed in cell colonies. By day 10, the percentage of Sox2+/Nestin+ cells reached ∼25% (Figures 1B and 1F). Semiquantitative RT-PCR confirmed the expression of other NSC genes, including Pax6, Sox2, Ascl1, and Olig2, in this population (Figure S1H). Further examination of the M9-induced neural reprogramming process revealed that generation of these METed cell colonies would require a period as short as only 6 days, while expression of NSC genes in these colonies could not be maintained in the absence of M9, indicating an unstable/incomplete transition status by day 6 (data not shown). However, it was found that 10-day induction is sufficient to induce the stable expression of NSC genes (Figures 1B and 1C). After passaging, the whole population became morphologically homogeneous (Figure S2A). The homogeneity was further examined by analyzing the expression of Sox2, Nestin, and an additional NSC marker, Pax6. By immunostaining, we found the percentage of cells co-expressing Sox2 and Nestin, Pax6 and Nestin, or Sox2 and Pax6 was ∼87.46%, 92.12%, and 79.95% at passage 2 and 97.62%, 94.39% and 93.36% at passage 12, respectively. Notably, all these Sox2+/Nestin+ cells also expressed tdTomato, demonstrating a conversion from fibroblasts (Figures 1B and 1C). To further characterize M9-induced tdTomato+/Sox2+/Nestin+ cells, they were serially propagated in conventional NSC expansion medium containing bFGF and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Conti et al., 2005Conti L.

These cells were highly proliferative, as 73.53% ± 4.10% of the cells showed incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (Figure 1C). They were able to form neurospheres in suspension culture over at least ten passages (Figure S2A). These cells showed exponential growth in a quantitative manner, similar to primary neural progenitor cells (pri-NPCs) and NSC line SCR029 (Figure S2B). FACS analysis with propidium iodide staining showed that the cell-cycle distribution (G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases) was 41.30%, 8.11%, and 41.10% for passage 2 and 57.30%, 11.50%, and 30.60% for passage 12, similar to the cell-cycle profiles of pri-NPCs and SCR029 (Figure S2C). Morphologically, these cells maintained a non-polarized homogeneous population in monolayer culture and did not form polarized rosette-structure (Figures 1C and S2A). These cells expressed multiple CNS NSC markers, including Sox2, Nestin, Pax6, Olig2, and N-cadherin (Figures 1C and 1D; Table S4). The expression of these genes in independent lines was comparable to those in pri-NPCs and SCR029 (Figure 1D). By immunostaining or RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we could not detect the expression of Dach1 and PLZF (also known as Zbtb16) (Elkabetz et al., 2008Elkabetz Y. Panagiotakos G. Al Shamy G. Socci N.D. Tabar V. Studer L. Human ES cell-derived neural rosettes reveal a functionally distinct early neural stem cell stage.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 152-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), but some radial glia-like cell markers, such as Glast (also known as Slc1a3) and BLBP (also known as Fabp7) (Table S5), indicating that these cells may resemble bFGF/EGF-adopted post-rosette-stage neural stem cells (Conti et al., 2005Conti L.

Adherent neural stem (NS) cells from fetal and adult forebrain.Cereb. Cortex. 2006; 16: i112-i120Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Transcriptome analysis revealed that these cells closely resembled mouse NSCs but were distinct from tdMEFs (Figure 1E). Those fibroblast-originated, highly proliferative, and self-renewable Sox2/Nestin double-positive cells are thereafter referred to as chemical-induced neural stem cell-like cells (ciNSLCs). In addition to reproducible results with different batches of tdMEFs (n = 4), MEFs with different genetic backgrounds were also tested with the M9 condition. Ten days after M9 treatment, the percentage of Sox2+/Nestin+ cells was ∼16.40% and 27.95% for MEFs of 129 × C57BL/6 or 129 background, respectively (Figure 1F). Furthermore, M9 could induce Fsp1-Cre/ROSA26tdTomato-traced mouse tail-tip fibroblasts (tdTTF) into ciNSLCs, albeit at a lower reprogramming efficiency (∼0.6%–2.9%; Figure 1F). The tdTTF-derived ciNSLCs resemble pri-NPCs, as they have comparable expression of multiple NSC markers, as evidenced by qRT-PCR (Figure 1D) and immunostaining (Figure S3A), similar proliferation rate (Figure S2B), and the ability to differentiate into mature neurons (Figure S3B). To determine if tdTomato+ cells exhibited any preferential response to M9 treatment, we sorted Fsp1-Cre/ROSA26tdTomato MEFs by FACS into p75−/tdTomato+ and p75−/tdTomato− populations and treated them with M9 condition. Approximately 26.7% of tdTomato+ cells and 31.0% of tdTomato− cells became Sox2+/Nestin+ ciNSLCs 10 days after M9 treatment, demonstrating a comparable efficiency (Figure S2D). These results collectively demonstrate that M9 cocktail has a robust and general effect on reprogramming fibroblasts into ciNSLCs. To characterize the differentiation potential of expanded ciNSLCs, they were first cultured under spontaneous differentiation condition without bFGF and EGF. By immunostaining, ciNSLCs gave rise to approximately 67.9% Tuj1+ neurons and 16.5% GFAP+ astrocytes at passage 5, and this differentiation potential was well maintained during prolonged culture (passage 10; Figure 2H). To examine the neuron differentiation in vitro (Kim et al., 2011Kim J. Efe J.A. Zhu S. Talantova M. Yuan X. Wang S. Lipton S.A. Zhang K. Ding S. Direct reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts to neural progenitors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 7838-7843Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), we observed tdTomato+ cells with immature neuronal morphology as early as day 3 (Figure S4A). Upon further differentiation, mature neurons with elaborate processes that expressed a panel of typical neuronal markers, including Tuj1, Map2, NeuN, and Synapsin I, were readily detected at day 10 onward (Figures 2A–2C). Subsequent analysis revealed that most of the neurons were vGlut1+, indicating an excitatory glutamatergic phenotype, while ∼8.6%–14.7% were GABA+ inhibitory neurons (Figures 2D, 2E, and 2I). To more rigorously characterize these differentiated neurons, we examined their electrophysiological properties. As expected, they generated repetitive trains of action potentials elicited by depolarizing the membrane in the current-clamp mode (8 out of 11; Figure 3A). In addition, the inactivating inward and persistent outward currents were observed in the voltage-clamp mode, which could be blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX, 3 out of 3) or tetraethylammonium (TEA, 3 out of 3), respectively, indicating the presence of functional sodium or potassium channels (Figures 3B and 3C). Furthermore, the ciNSLC-derived neurons exhibited strong spontaneous synaptic network activities (4 out of 11; Figure 3D), suggesting the formation of functional synapses, consistent with Synapsin I expression at the synaptic puncta along dendrites (Figure 2C). Moreover, these neurons responded to direct activation of excitatory (glutamate, 3 out of 3; Figure 3E) or inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors (GABA, 2 out of 5; Figure 3F) and exhibited postsynaptic currents. These results demonstrated that ciNSLCs could generate functional neurons in vitro. In addition to neuronal differentiation, ciNSLCs can differentiate into O4+ oligodendrocytes with typical multi-branching morphology after treatment with T3 (Figures 2F and S4B) (Glaser et al., 2007Glaser T. Pollard S.M. Smith A. Brüstle O. Tripotential differentiation of adherently expandable neural stem (NS) cells.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e298Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, Najm et al., 2013Najm F.J. Lager A.M. Zaremba A.

Transcription factor-mediated reprogramming of fibroblasts to expandable, myelinogenic oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Importantly, those differentiated oligodendrocytes expressed myelin basic protein (MBP; Figure 2F) and other defining markers of mature oligodendrocytes, including myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) (Figure S4B), and can myelinate the axons in vitro (Figure S4C). ciNSLCs can also generate characteristic GFAP-, and S100β-positive astrocytes when treated with BMP4 (Figure 2G). qRT-PCR revealed the upregulation of glial genes, including Gfap for astrocytes and Mbp and Plp1 for oligodendrocytes, upon directed differentiation (Figure S4D). Thus, the expanded ciNSLCs are tripotent and can robustly generate neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in vitro. To determine ciNSLC’s differentiation potential in vivo, they were microinjected into the cortices of postnatal mouse pups (n = 6), and their survival and differentiation were evaluated 2–4 weeks after injection. Remarkably, tdTomato-marked ciNSLC progeny survived in the cortex of all mice we analyzed. These ciNSLCs efficiently differentiated into NeuN-positive mature neurons, Olig2-positive oligodendrocytes, and GFAP-positive astrocytes (Figure 3G). No tumor was found 4 weeks post-injection (data not shown). This in vivo differentiation potential of ciNSLCs was validated by two independent ciNSLC lines. Taken together, the expanded ciNSLCs resemble primary NSCs by their marker expression and abilities to self-renew and differentiate in vitro and in vivo. To determine the regional identity of ciNSLC, the expression of regional markers along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes of neural tube were analyzed. The early-passage ciNSLC (passage 2) stained positive for the forebrain marker Foxg1, but did not express the midbrain marker En1, and hindbrain marker Hoxa2 and/or posterior marker Hoxb4 (Figures 4A and 4C ). However, the anterior identity was lost in late-passage ciNSLCs (passage 12), which acquired posterior identity and stained positive for Hoxb4 (Figure 4B). We confirmed this transition by qRT-PCR or RNA-seq. In contrast to passage 2, which exhibited high expression of the forebrain gene Foxg1, ciNSLCs at passage 12 showed no expression of Foxg1 and En1 but predominantly expressed hindbrain and spinal cord genes, including Hoxa2, Hoxa3, Hoxa5, and Hoxb4, indicating a posterior regionalization of stable ciNSLCs (Figure 4C; Table S5). Along the dorsal-ventral axis, stable ciNSLCs showed high expression of ventral genes Olig2 and Nkx2.2 but no or low expression of other ventral and dorsal genes, such as Pax3 and Pax7, respectively (Figure 4C; Table S5). Therefore, stable ciNSLCs are mostly compatible with a posterior ventral fate. To confirm this regional property, we found that ciNSLCs at passage 12 exhibited propensity to differentiate into choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)- and Islet1-positive neurons after 15 day differentiation in the presence of 10 ng/ml BDNF, 20 ng/ml GDNF, 10 ng/ml NT3, 2 μM db-cAMP, and 200 μM ascorbic acid (Figure S4E). We did not observe neurons that stained positive for tyrosine hydroxylase or serotonin, for both early- and late-passage ciNSLCs (data not shown). When these stable ciNSLCs were subjected to an “induced” differentiation protocol (pre-patterned with 1 μM RA and 200 ng/ml Shh for 5 days, then cultured in presence of 10 ng/ml BDNF, 20 ng/ml GDNF, 10 ng/ml NT3, 2 μM db-cAMP, and 20"

Our findings support use of systematic genome editing in hPSCs as a strategy for understanding mechanisms underlying congenital disorders. The advancements in next-generation sequencing and genome-wide association studies have led to the identification of hundreds of disease-associated sequence variants. Thus, there is an urgent need for a functional evaluation platform to rapidly identify disease-causing mutations. A promising strategy involves the use of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including both embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (hESCs and hiPSCs), for disease modeling. However, the limited access to patient material and the relatively low genome-editing throughput has been a bottleneck for increasing the output of hPSC-based models. Furthermore, most hPSC studies so far have focused on generating disease-relevant cell types for studying disease phenotypes that are manifested at the cellular level, whereas the utility of hPSCs for studying more complex biological processes such as a multistep developmental process remains uncertain. A unique challenge of modeling developmental defects lies in the need for faithful recreation of the complexity of embryonic development in a petri dish. Despite considerable progress, it remains challenging to perfectly recapitulate the contexts of embryonic development such as complex tissue-tissue interactions, and many in vivo biologists remain skeptical of the relevance of hPSCs for studying developmental disorders. In comparison, to study the cellular phenotype of a disease, some deviation from in vivo development can be tolerated; for instance, one may generate disease-relevant cell types without mimicking development at all through direct lineage reprogramming (Qiang et al., 2014Qiang L. Inoue K. Abeliovich A. Instant neurons: directed somatic cell reprogramming models of central nervous system disorders.Biol. Psychiatry. 2014; 75: 945-951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). There are also technical concerns of using hPSCs for developmental studies. Developmental phenotypes are typically manifested as changes in the efficiencies of hPSCs to differentiate into a specific lineage of interest, which could be obscured by variations in differentiation propensity among hPSC lines from different genetic backgrounds (Bock et al., 2011Bock C. Kiskinis E. Verstappen G. Gu H. Boulting G. Smith Z.D. Ziller M. Croft G.F. Amoroso M.W.

Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 313-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). We have recently established an efficient genome-editing platform in hPSCs named iCRISPR through the use of TALENs (transcription activator like effector nucleases) and CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats [CRISPR]/CRISPR-associated) system (González et al., 2014González F. Zhu Z. Shi Z.D. Lelli K. Verma N. Li Q.V. Huangfu D. An iCRISPR platform for rapid, multiplexable, and inducible genome editing in human pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 215-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Combining the power of genome editing and stem cell biology, we set out to systematically probe transcriptional control of pancreatic development and the developmental defects involved in permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM), a rare monogenic form of diabetes that occurs during the first 6 months of life (Aguilar-Bryan and Bryan, 2008Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neonatal diabetes mellitus.Endocr. Rev. 2008; 29: 265-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Our analysis not only defines the specific developmental step(s) affected by these mutations but also revealed a number of insights into disease mechanisms, including a role of RFX6 in regulating the number of pancreatic progenitors, a dosage-sensitive requirement for PDX1 in pancreatic endocrine development, and a potentially divergent role of NGN3 in humans and mice. Taking full advantage of the power of genome editing, we further performed temporal rescue studies to investigate the competence window for NGN3-dependent pancreatic β cell formation as well as gene correction experiments to verify CRISPR targeting specificity. Thus the hESC-based genetic model not only offers the speed and scale necessary to meet the growing demand for validating disease causality but also enables sophisticated genetic manipulations for mechanistic investigations. The systematic probing of transcription factors that regulate pancreatic development also forms the foundation for understanding the transcriptional circuitry involved in human pancreatic development, and it provides much-needed information for advancing hPSC-based β cell replacement therapies for treatment of diabetes. To harness the power of hESCs for functional human genetics, it is necessary to first establish efficient genetic approaches for knocking out or ectopically expressing a gene of interest. Although viral vectors offer a convenient method for transgene expression, low infection efficiency, random integration, and transgene silencing have limited its application in hESCs (Saha and Jaenisch, 2009Saha K. Jaenisch R. Technical challenges in using human induced pluripotent stem cells to model disease.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 584-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Building upon previous findings (DeKelver et al., 2010DeKelver R.C. Choi V.M. Moehle E.A. Paschon D.E. Hockemeyer D. Meijsing S.H. Sancak Y. Cui X. Steine E.J. Miller J.C. et al.Functional genomics, proteomics, and regulatory DNA analysis in isogenic settings using zinc finger nuclease-driven transgenesis into a safe harbor locus in the human genome.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), we targeted the AAVS1 transgene safe harbor locus with a pair of TALENs for simultaneous integration of two transgenes in trans, one with a constitutive promoter driving the expression of an optimized form of reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (M2rtTA) and the other with a tetracycline-response element (TRE) driving the expression of a gene of interest (Figure 1A). This system conveniently generates hESC lines for doxycycline-inducible gene expression, which is critical for studying developmental mechanisms in a stage-specific manner. In a typical targeting experiment, as shown for the creation of inducible GFP-expressing lines (named iGFP), approximately half of the clonal lines had correct biallelic transgene integration without random insertions based on PCR genotyping and Southern blot analysis (Figures S1A–S1D). Because of this high efficiency, only 6−12 clonal lines need to be analyzed after electroporation, making it feasible to generate inducible expression lines for multiple genes in parallel in just a month (Figure S1B). We also made this system compatible with the Gateway recombination cloning technology, reducing the time and effort needed for generating the targeting constructs (Figure S1E). To model pancreatic development, we adapted a directed differentiation protocol initially established by D’Amour and colleagues and now widely used in the original or modified forms (D’Amour et al., 2006D’Amour K.A.

Using HUES8 hESCs, we routinely generate ∼50%−80% definitive endoderm (DE) cells co-expressing SOX17 and FOXA2 after 3 days of differentiation and ∼50% PDX1-expressing (PDX1+) pancreatic progenitor (PP) cells (also co-expressing additional PP markers such as SOX9 and HNF6) after 6 additional days of differentiation (Figure S1F). Further differentiation generates pancreatic endocrine cells that express endocrine hormones such as insulin (INS) and glucagon (GCG) characteristic of β and α cells respectively. As observed by others (D’Amour et al., 2006D’Amour K.A. Bang A.G. Eliazer S. Kelly O.G. Agulnick A.D. Smart N.G. Moorman M.A. Kroon E. Carpenter M.K. Baetge E.E. Production of pancreatic hormone-expressing endocrine cells from human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1392-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar), the INS-expressing (INS+) cells often co-express hormones such as GCG and somatostatin (SST), thus resembling immature polyhormonal β cells, which we refer to as PH-β hereafter. Using iGFP hESC lines, we confirmed relatively uniform GFP expression upon doxycycline treatment at each differentiation step (Figure S1G). Thus, we went on to perturb NOTCH and NGN3 during hESC differentiation because of their well-demonstrated roles from murine studies in inhibiting and promoting endocrine differentiation, respectively (Shih et al., 2013Shih H.P. Wang A. Sander M. Pancreas organogenesis: from lineage determination to morphogenesis.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2013; 29: 81-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We generated iNotchIC and iNGN3 hESC lines for inducible expression of NotchIC (Notch intracellular domain, the constitutively active form of Notch1) and NGN3, respectively (Figures 1B and 1C). iNotchIC and iNGN3 hESC cells were differentiated to the PP stage, treated with doxycycline, and then examined at the PH-β stage for expression of endocrine markers (Figure 1D). Activation of Notch signaling completely blocked the formation of endocrine cells as indicated by immunofluorescence staining for C-peptide (CPEP), INS, GCG, and SST at the PH-β stage (Figure 1D). In contrast, expression of these endocrine markers was greatly promoted by NGN3 overexpression (Figure 1D). Due to concerns of potential uptake of insulin from the culture media (Rajagopal et al., 2003Rajagopal J. Anderson W.J. Kume S. Martinez O.I. Melton D.A. Insulin staining of ES cell progeny from insulin uptake.Science. 2003; 299: 363PubMed Google Scholar), the expression of C-peptide, the byproduct of insulin biosynthesis, was used for quantification of insulin-producing cells hereafter. Overexpression of NGN3 led to an ∼10-fold increase of INS+ cells based on CPEP intracellular staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (Figures 1E and 1F). The pro-endocrine effect of NGN3 was also supported by qRT-PCR analysis, which showed an increase in all pancreatic endocrine hormone genes as well as key transcription factor genes such as NKX2.2, NEUROD1, ISL1, and MAFB (Figure 1G). These findings mirror results from murine studies and support the employment of conserved genetic networks in hESC differentiation and in vivo biology. In parallel to the gain-of-function approach, we set out to generate an array of mutant lines affecting eight key transcription factor genes involved in pancreatic development (Figure 2B). Six of the genes (PDX1, RFX6, PTF1A, GLIS3, MNX1, and NGN3) are associated with PNDM, and biallelic inactivation of these genes is thought to be responsible for the absence of pancreatic endocrine cells including β cells in patients (Flanagan et al., 2014Flanagan S.E.

Mutations in a subset of these genes (e.g., PDX1 and PTF1A) are associated with severe deficiencies in both endocrine and exocrine pancreas, a condition known as pancreatic agenesis. Two additional genes (ARX and HES1) were chosen because in contrast to the pro-endocrine roles of PNDM-associated genes above, Hes1 inhibits endocrine development whereas Arx is necessary for the formation of α cells, but not β cells, in mice (Collombat et al., 2003Collombat P. Mansouri A. Hecksher-Sorensen J. Serup P. Krull J. Gradwohl G. Gruss P.

We previously established the iCRISPR platform based on the creation of iCas9 hESCs that express the RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9 upon doxycycline treatment (Figure 2A) (González et al., 2014González F. Zhu Z. Shi Z.D. Lelli K. Verma N. Li Q.V. Huangfu D. An iCRISPR platform for rapid, multiplexable, and inducible genome editing in human pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 215-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Transfecting doxycycline-treated iCas9 hESCs with synthetic chimeric guide RNAs (gRNAs) directs Cas9 for site-specific DNA cleavage and enables efficient generation of mutant hESC lines. To further increase the throughput, we designed a PCR-based strategy for in vitro gRNA synthesis compatible with multi-well format (Figure S2A), enabling the generation of a large number of gRNAs in a single day. For each gene of interest, we used two gRNAs to offset potential CRISPR/Cas off-target effects, and targeted distinct sequences either shortly after the start codon or within sequences corresponding to critical functional domains (Figures S2B and S2C; Table S1). To verify the generation of knockout alleles, we identified mutant lines with frameshift mutations and performed western blot analysis for the corresponding protein when reliable antibodies were available (Figure 2D). In protein lysates collected from the PH-β stage, PDX1, MNX1, and HES1 proteins were detected in wild-type cells, but not in the corresponding biallelic mutant cells. A decrease in protein levels was also noticed in PDX1 and MNX1 heterozygous mutant lines. These findings support the generation of null or strong loss-of-function alleles. For simplicity, we refer to biallelic and monoalleic frameshift mutations as the “−/−” and “+/−” genotypes respectively henceforward. The large collection of knockout hESC lines presented us the opportunity to systematically interrogate the pathogenesis of PNDM by characterizing mutant phenotypes at each differentiation stage (i.e., DE, PP, and PH-β stages) using a panel of assays including FACS analysis (Figure 2B). To mitigate potential line-to-line variations, we examined four −/− mutant lines per gene (two gRNAs per gene and two lines per gRNA) except for HES1, for which we analyzed two −/− lines from one gRNA (Table S3). Two lines from the same targeting experiment without mutations in the target gene were randomly chosen as isogenic wild-type controls. As consistent phenotypes were observed in all analyses, results of mutant lines affecting the same gene were combined for statistical analysis. In the undifferentiated state, all clonal lines displayed typical hESC morphology and expressed key pluripotency proteins such as NANOG and OCT4 (POU5F1) as determined by immunofluorescence staining (Figures S3A and S3B). None of the mutations affected DE formation as shown by examination of DE markers SOX17 and FOXA2 (co-immunostaining) and CXCR4 (FACS) (Figures 3A, S3C, and S3D). At the PP stage, no PDX1+ cells were detected in PDX1−/− mutant lines by immunostaining and FACS analysis as expected (Figures 3A, S3E, and S3F). All other mutants formed PDX1+ pancreatic progenitors normally except for RFX6−/− mutants, which showed a ∼40% reduction of PDX1+ cells compared with wild-type lines (Figures 3A and S3F). At the PH-β stage, all −/− mutant lines exhibited a defect with the exception of PTF1A−/−, MNX1−/−, and GLIS3−/− mutants. PDX1−/−, RFX6−/−, and NGN3−/− mutants all exhibit a severe impairment in forming INS+ or GCG+ cells by immunofluorescence staining and FACS analysis (Figures 3B and 3C). qRT-PCR analysis also detected a significant reduction in the expression of additional endocrine hormone genes SST and GHRL (Figure 3D). These findings demonstrate critical requirements for PDX1, RFX6, and NGN3 in proper pancreatic endocrine differentiation and establish causal roles of the corresponding mutations in PNDM. Distinct phenotypes were observed in HES1−/− and ARX−/Y mutants. A significant increase of endocrine cells was observed in HES1−/− mutants based on INS and GCG immunofluorescence staining and qRT-PCR analysis (p < 0.05), and FACS analysis detected an ∼2-fold increase of INS+ cells (Figures 3A–3D). These findings are in agreement with conclusions from murine studies that HES1 inhibits pancreatic endocrine differentiation (Apelqvist et al., 1999Apelqvist A. Li H. Sommer L. Beatus P.

In ARX−/Y mutants, GCG+ cells were absent as determined by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 3B), which is also observed from murine studies (Collombat et al., 2003Collombat P. Mansouri A. Hecksher-Sorensen J. Serup P. Krull J. Gradwohl G. Gruss P. Opposing actions of Arx and Pax4 in endocrine pancreas development.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2591-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). We also noticed an ∼30% reduction in the number of INS+ cells as determined by FACS analysis (Figures 3A and 3C). qRT-PCR analysis confirmed corresponding changes in GCG and INS mRNA expression (p < 0.01) (Figure 3D). This finding is consistent with a recent report on the requirement for ARX in specifying GCG and INS expressing cells (Gage et al., 2015Gage B.K. Asadi A. Baker R.K. Webber T.D. Wang R. Itoh M. Hayashi M. Miyata R. Akashi T. Kieffer T.J. The role of ARX in human pancreatic endocrine specification.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0144100Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), though the reduction of INS+ cells could also reflect the loss of immature polyhormonal β cells in ARX−/Y mutant lines. Our study revealed an unexpected reduction of PDX1+ pancreatic progenitor cells in RFX6−/− mutants. RFX6 is known to regulate the differentiation of pancreatic progenitors into endocrine cells during embryonic development (Smith et al., 2010Smith S.B. Qu H.Q. Taleb N. Kishimoto N.Y. Scheel D.W.

Raffelsberger W. Beucher A. Orvain C. Peers B. Ravassard P. Vermot J. Voz M.L. Mellitzer G. Gradwohl G. Rfx6 is an Ngn3-dependent winged helix transcription factor required for pancreatic islet cell development.Development. 2010; 137: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and it is also important for adult β cell function (Chandra et al., 2014Chandra V. Albagli-Curiel O. Hastoy B. Piccand J. Randriamampita C. Vaillant E. Cavé H. Busiah K. Froguel P.

Rfx6 maintains the functional identity of adult pancreatic β cells.Cell Rep. 2014; 9: 2219-2232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, an earlier requirement for RFX6 in the specification of pancreatic progenitor cells is unknown. The reduction of pancreatic progenitor cells was not caused by reduced proliferation or increased apoptosis. In fact, by immunofluorescence staining and FACS analysis at the PP stage, RFX6−/− mutants showed a slightly higher percentage of PDX1+ cells expressing the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 and a reduced percentage of PDX1+ cells expressing the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 (Figures 4A–4C and S4A). Instead, we observed decreased PDX1 immunofluorescence intensity in RFX6−/− pancreatic progenitors, which was also corroborated by a leftward shift in the FACS histogram compared to wild-type cells (Figures 4A and 4D). Thus, RFX6 regulates PDX1 expression either direct or indirectly, and without RFX6, the formation of pancreatic progenitor cells is impaired or delayed. A reduced number of pancreatic progenitor cells in embryos would predict a smaller pancreas in adults (Stanger et al., 2007Stanger B.Z. Tanaka A.J. Melton D.A. Organ size is limited by the number of embryonic progenitor cells in the pancreas but not the liver.Nature. 2007; 445: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Indeed, a reduction in the size of the pancreas was noted in Rfx6−/− mice as well as in patients carrying biallelic RFX6 mutations (Concepcion et al., 2014Concepcion J.P. Reh C.S. Daniels M. Liu X. Paz V.P. Ye H. Highland H.M. Hanis C.L. Greeley S.A. Neonatal diabetes, gallbladder agenesis, duodenal atresia, and intestinal malrotation caused by a novel homozygous mutation in RFX6.Pediatr.

Lynn F.C. et al.Rfx6 directs islet formation and insulin production in mice and humans.Nature. 2010; 463: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We speculate that a similar phenotype is likely present during mouse development, and the sensitivity of the FACS assay contributed to the detection of this early phenotype in the hESC system. In analyzing PDX1+/− mutants, a ∼65% reduction of INS+ cells was detected at the PH-β stage by FACS analysis (Figures 4E–4H). Further immunofluorescence staining confirmed the reduction of both INS+ and GCG+ cells (Figure 4F), and qRT-PCR analysis revealed a similar decrease in all pancreatic endocrine hormone genes, with INS and SST being the most affected (Figure 4I). The haploinsufficiency of PDX1 in endocrine differentiation is surprising. Although PDX1 heterozygous patients exhibit diabetes with the age of onset ranging from 17 to 67 years (Stoffers et al., 1997aStoffers D.A. Ferrer J. Clarke W.L. Habener J.F. Early-onset type-II diabetes mellitus (MODY4) linked to IPF1.Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 138-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), it is thought to be caused by defects in β-cell function and/or the maintenance of β-cell mass in adults (Brissova et al., 2002Brissova M.

No developmental abnormalities are known to occur in Pdx1+/− mice (Jonsson et al., 1994Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H.

We therefore performed additional experiments to confirm that the unexpected phenotype observed in PDX1+/− hESCs was due to haploinsufficiency rather than the frameshift alleles having dominant-negative effects. The two PDX1 heterozygous mutant lines carry different frameshift mutations, PDX1L36fs and PDX1A34fs (Figure 4E). To verify that no functional protein was made from the mutant allele, we examined two biallelic mutant lines carrying the same mutations, PDX1L36fs/L36fs and PDX1L36fs/A34fs, at the PP stage so that the consequence of these mutations could be determined without interference of any endocrine differentiation phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2344649716,"Postsynaptic kainate-type glutamate receptors (KARs) regulate synaptic network activity through their slow channel kinetics, most prominently at mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 synapses in the hippocampus. Nevertheless, how KARs cluster and function at these synapses has been unclear. Here, we show that C1q-like proteins C1ql2 and C1ql3, produced by MFs, serve as extracellular organizers to recruit functional postsynaptic KAR complexes to the CA3 pyramidal neurons. C1ql2 and C1ql3 specifically bound the amino-terminal domains of postsynaptic GluK2 and GluK4 KAR subunits and the presynaptic neurexin 3 containing a specific sequence in vitro. In C1ql2/3 double-null mice, CA3 synaptic responses lost the slow, KAR-mediated components. Furthermore, despite induction of MF sprouting in a temporal lobe epilepsy model, KARs were not recruited to postsynaptic sites in C1ql2/3 double-null mice, leading to reduced recurrent circuit activities. C1q family proteins, broadly expressed, are likely to modulate KAR function throughout the brain and represent promising antiepileptic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2342999003,"Transplantation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neurons is a promising avenue for treating disorders including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Precise control over engrafted cell activity is highly desired, as cells do not always integrate properly into host circuitry and can cause suboptimal graft function or undesired outcomes. Here, we show tunable rescue of motor function in a mouse model of PD, following transplantation of human midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons differentiated from hPSCs engineered to express DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drug). Administering clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) enabled precise DREADD-dependent stimulation or inhibition of engrafted neurons, revealing D1 receptor-dependent regulation of host neuronal circuitry by engrafted cells. Transplanted cells rescued motor defects, which could be reversed or enhanced by CNO-based control of graft function, and activating engrafted cells drives behavioral changes in transplanted mice. These results highlight the ability to exogenously and noninvasively control and refine therapeutic outcomes following cell transplantation."

Exposure to an enriched environment and constraint of dendritic growth by disrupting Wnt signaling led to increased branch addition and accelerated growth, which were, however, counteracted by earlier and more extensive pruning. Our results indicate that pruning is regulated in a homeostatic fashion to oppose excessive branching and promote a similar dendrite structure in DGCs."

Methods This study linked routine primary and secondary care EHRs in Wales, UK. A machine learning based scheme was used to identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis from primary care EHRs via the following steps: i) selection of variables by comparing relative frequencies of Read codes in the primary care dataset associated with disease case compared to non-disease control (disease/non-disease based on the secondary care diagnosis); ii) reduction of predictors/associated variables using a Random Forest method, iii) induction of decision rules from decision tree model. The proposed method was then extensively validated on an independent dataset, and compared for performance with two existing deterministic algorithms for RA which had been developed using expert clinical knowledge. Results Primary care EHRs were available for 2,238,360 patients over the age of 16 and of these 20,667 were also linked in the secondary care rheumatology clinical system. In the linked dataset, 900 predictors (out of a total of 43,100 variables) in the primary care record were discovered more frequently in those with versus those without RA. These variables were reduced to 37 groups of related clinical codes, which were used to develop a decision tree model. The final algorithm identified 8 predictors related to diagnostic codes for RA, medication codes, such as those for disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, and absence of alternative diagnoses such as psoriatic arthritis. The proposed data-driven method performed as well as the expert clinical knowledge based methods. Conclusion Data-driven scheme, such as ensemble machine learning methods, has the potential of identifying the most informative predictors in a cost-effective and rapid way to accurately and reliably classify rheumatoid arthritis or other complex medical conditions in primary care EHRs."

Serum miRNAs were extracted from all subjects to assess the expression profiles for the following miRNAs (miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-146a, miR-223, miR-24, miR-454, miR-183, miR-135a, miR- 135b and miR- 92a) using the custom miScript miRNA PCR-based sybergreen array. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the studied miRNAs for colorectal cancer diagnosis.Data analysis of miRNA from the training set showed that; compared to control group, only miR-19b was significantly up-regulated in patients with IBD group (fold change = 5.24, p = 0.016), whereas in patients with colonic polyps, miR-18a was significantly up-regulated (fold change = 3.49, p-value = 0.018). On the other hand, miR-17, miR-19a, miR-20a and miR-223 were significantly up-regulated (fold change = 2.35, 3.07, 2.38 and 10.35; respectively and p-value = 0.02, 0.015, 0.017 and 0.016; respectively in CRC patients. However, the validation set showed that only miR-223 was significantly up-regulated in CRC patients (fold change = 4.06, p-value = 0.04).Aberrant miRNA expressions are highly involved in the cascade of colorectal carcinogenesis. We have found that (miR-17, miR-19a, miR-20a and miR-223) could be used as diagnostic biomarkers for CRC. On the other hand, miR-19b and miR-18a could be used as diagnostic biomarkers for CP and IBD respectively."

Samples were taken from the deepest layer of dentinal caries lesions associated with pulp exposure in 10 teeth diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. DNA was extracted and the microbiome was characterized on the basis of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene by using paired-end sequencing on Illumina MiSeq device. Bacterial taxa were mapped to 14 phyla and 101 genera composed by 706 different OTUs. Three phyla accounted for approximately 98% of the sequences: Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. These phyla were also the ones with most representatives at the species level. Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in 9/10 samples. As for genera, Lactobacillus accounted for 42.3% of the sequences, followed by Olsenella (13.7%), Pseudoramibacter (10.7%) and Streptococcus (5.5%). Half of the samples were heavily dominated by Lactobacillus, while in the other half lactobacilli were in very low abundance and the most dominant genera were Pseudoramibacter, Olsenella, Streptococcus, and Stenotrophomonas. High bacterial diversity occurred in deep dentinal caries lesions associated with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. The microbiome could be classified according to the relative abundance of Lactobacillus. Except for Lactobacillus species, most of the highly prevalent and abundant bacterial taxa identified in this study have been commonly detected in infected root canals. The detected taxa can be regarded as candidate pathogens for irreversible pulpitis and possibly the pioneers in pulp invasion to initiate endodontic infection."

However, little is known about how electrical coupling strength is determined due to the inaccessibility of gap junctions on the dendritic tree. We investigated the properties of gap junctions in cerebellar interneurons by combining paired somato-somatic and somato-dendritic recordings, anatomical reconstructions, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and modeling. By fitting detailed compartmental models of Golgi cells to their somato-dendritic voltage responses, we determined their passive electrical properties and the mean gap junction conductance (0.9 nS). Connexin36 immunofluorescence and freeze-fracture replica immunogold labeling revealed a large variability in gap junction size and that only 18% of the 340 channels are open in each plaque. Our results establish that the number of gap junctions per connection is the main determinant of both the strength and variability in electrical coupling between Golgi cells."
https://openalex.org/W2345952626,"Insects are often attacked by multiple natural enemies, imposing dynamic selective pressures for the development and maintenance of enemy-specific resistance. Pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) have emerged as models for the study of variation in resistance against natural enemies, including parasitoid wasps. Internal defenses against their most common parasitoid wasp, Aphidius ervi, are sourced through two known mechanisms- 1) endogenously encoded resistance or 2) infection with the heritable bacterial symbiont, Hamiltonella defensa. Levels of resistance can range from nearly 0-100% against A. ervi but varies based on aphid genotype and the strain of toxin-encoding bacteriophage (called APSE) carried by Hamiltonella. Previously, other parasitoid wasps were found to commonly attack this host, but North American introductions of A. ervi have apparently displaced all other parasitoids except Praon pequodorum, a related aphidiine braconid wasp, which is still found attacking this host in natural populations. To explain P. pequodorum's persistence, multiple studies have compared direct competition between both wasps, but have not examined specificity of host defenses as an indirectly mediating factor. Using an array of experimental aphid lines, we first examined whether aphid defenses varied in effectiveness toward either wasp species. Expectedly, both types of aphid defenses were effective against A. ervi, but unexpectedly, were completely ineffective against P. pequodorum. Further examination showed that P. pequodorum wasps suffered no consistent fitness costs from developing in even highly 'resistant' aphids. Comparison of both wasps' egg-larval development revealed that P. pequodorum's eggs have thicker chorions and hatch two days later than A. ervi's, likely explaining their differing abilities to overcome aphid defenses. Overall, our results indicate that aphids resistant to A. ervi may serve as reservoirs for P. pequodorum, hence contributing to its persistence in field populations. We find that specificity of host defenses and defensive symbiont infections, may have important roles in influencing enemy compositions by indirectly mediating the interactions and abundance of rival natural enemies."
https://openalex.org/W2346790351,"Many ecological theories and species conservation programmes rely on accurate estimates of population density. Accurate density estimation, especially for species facing rapid declines, requires the application of rigorous field and analytical methods. However, obtaining accurate density estimates of carnivores can be challenging as carnivores naturally exist at relatively low densities and are often elusive and wide-ranging. In this study, we employ an unstructured spatial sampling field design along with a Bayesian sex-specific spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) analysis, to provide the first rigorous population density estimates of cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) in the Maasai Mara, Kenya. We estimate adult cheetah density to be between 1.28 ± 0.315 and 1.34 ± 0.337 individuals/100km2 across four candidate models specified in our analysis. Our spatially explicit approach revealed 'hotspots' of cheetah density, highlighting that cheetah are distributed heterogeneously across the landscape. The SECR models incorporated a movement range parameter which indicated that male cheetah moved four times as much as females, possibly because female movement was restricted by their reproductive status and/or the spatial distribution of prey. We show that SECR can be used for spatially unstructured data to successfully characterise the spatial distribution of a low density species and also estimate population density when sample size is small. Our sampling and modelling framework will help determine spatial and temporal variation in cheetah densities, providing a foundation for their conservation and management. Based on our results we encourage other researchers to adopt a similar approach in estimating densities of individually recognisable species."
https://openalex.org/W2345836284,"Background Motor Unit Number Index (MUNIX) is a neurophysiological measure that provides an index of the number of lower motor neurons in a muscle. Its performance across centres in healthy subjects and patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) has been established, but inter-rater variability between multiple raters in one single subject has not been investigated. Objective To assess reliability in a set of 6 muscles in a single subject among 12 examiners (6 experienced with MUNIX, 6 less experienced) and to determine variables associated with variability of measurements. Methods Twelve raters applied MUNIX in six different muscles (abductor pollicis brevis (APB), abductor digiti minimi (ADM), biceps brachii (BB), tibialis anterior (TA), extensor dig. brevis (EDB), abductor hallucis (AH)) twice in one single volunteer on consecutive days. All raters visited at least one training course prior to measurements. Intra- and inter-rater variability as determined by the coefficient of variation (COV) between different raters and their levels of experience with MUNIX were compared. Results Mean intra-rater COV of MUNIX was 14.0% (±6.4) ranging from 5.8 (APB) to 30.3% (EDB). Mean inter-rater COV was 18.1 (±5.4) ranging from 8.0 (BB) to 31.7 (AH). No significant differences of variability between experienced and less experienced raters were detected. Conclusion We provide evidence that quality control for neurophysiological methods can be performed with similar standards as in laboratory medicine. Intra- and inter-rater variability of MUNIX is muscle-dependent and mainly below 20%. Experienced neurophysiologists can easily adopt MUNIX and adequate teaching ensures reliable utilization of this method."

However, the role of animals in zoonotic transmission of the disease is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and genotypes of Cryptosporidium species in dairy calves; to assess the role of cattle in zoonotic transmission in central Ethiopia. A total of 449 fecal samples were collected and screened using modified Ziehl-Neelson staining method and PCR targeting the small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium was 9.4% (42/449) and 15.8% (71/449) as detected by microscopy and nested PCR, respectively. The prevalence of infection varied significantly across the study areas with the higher prevalence being observed in Chancho 25.4% (30/118). Crossbred calves had significantly higher prevalence of Cryptosporidium than indigenous zebu. Genotyping results revealed the presence of C. andersoni (76.1%), C. bovis (19.7%) and C. ryanae (4.2%). The occurrence of these Cryptosporidium species appeared to be age-related. C. andersoni constituted 92.1% of the Cryptosporidium infection in calves older than 3 months. Sequence analysis also showed the existence of intra-species variation at SSU rRNA gene. Findings of the current study indicate that cattle may not be an important source of zoonotic cryptosporidiosis in central Ethiopia. Further molecular studies are needed to support this observation from other part of the country."
https://openalex.org/W2345777583,"Echolocation is the ability to use reflected sound to obtain information about the spatial environment. Echolocation is an active process that requires both the production of the emission as well as the sensory processing of the resultant sound. Appreciating the general usefulness of echo-acoustic cues for people, in particular those with vision impairments, various devices have been built that exploit the principle of echolocation to obtain and provide information about the environment. It is common to all these devices that they do not require the person to make a sound. Instead, the device produces the emission autonomously and feeds a resultant sound back to the user. Here we tested if echolocation performance in a simple object detection task was affected by the use of a head-mounted loudspeaker as compared to active clicking. We found that 27 sighted participants new to echolocation did generally better when they used a loudspeaker as compared to mouth-clicks, and that two blind participants with experience in echolocation did equally well with mouth clicks and the speaker. Importantly, performance of sighted participants’ was not statistically different from performance of blind experts when they used the speaker. Based on acoustic click data collected from a subset of our participants, those participants whose mouth clicks were more similar to the speaker clicks, and thus had higher peak frequencies and sound intensity, did better. We conclude that our results are encouraging for the consideration and development of assistive devices that exploit the principle of echolocation."

In this study, maternal, paternal, and biparental genetic systems were applied to infer phylogenetic relationships among macaques and to trace ancient hybridization events in their evolutionary history. Using a PCR display method, 17 newly phylogenetically informative Alu insertions were identified from M. assamensis. We combined presence/absence analysis of 84 Alu elements with mitochondrial genomes as well as nuclear sequences (five autosomal genes, two Y chromosomal genes, and one X chromosomal fragment) to reconstruct a robust macaque phylogeny. Topologies generated from different inherited markers were similar supporting six well defined species groups and a close relationship of M. assamensis and M. thibetana, but differed in the placing of M. arctoides. Both Alu elements and nuclear genes supported that M. arctoides was close to the sinica group, whereas the mitochondrial data clustered it into the fascicularis/mulatta lineage. Our results reveal that a sex-biased hybridization most likely occurred in the evolutionary history of M. arctoides, and suggest an introgressive pattern of male-mediated gene flow from the ancestors of M. arctoides to the M. mulatta population followed by nuclear swamping. According to the estimation of divergence dates, the hybridization occurred around 0.88~1.77 mya (nuclear data) or 1.38~2.56 mya (mitochondrial data). In general, our study indicates that a combination of various molecular markers could help explain complicated evolutionary relationships. Our results have provided new insights into the evolutionary history of macaques and emphasize that hybridization might play an important role in macaque evolution."

Specific modulation of endogenous HDP synthesis by dietary compounds has been regarded as a novel approach to boost immunity and disease resistance in animal production. 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (1,25D3) is well known as a powerful HDP inducer in humans, but limited information about the effect of 1,25D3 on HDPs in poultry is available. Here, we sought to examine whether 1,25D3 could stimulate avian β-defensin (AvBD) expression in chickens. We used chicken embryo intestinal epithelial cells (CEIEPCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to study the effect of 1,25D3 on the expression of AvBDs. We observed that 1,25D3 is able to up-regulate the expression of several AvBDs in CEIEPCs and PBMCs, whereas it increased the amounts of AvBD4 mRNA in CEIEPCs only in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). On the other hand, LPS treatment not only inhibited the expression of CYP24A1 but also altered the expression pattern of VDR in CEIEPCs. Furthermore, AvBDs were not directly regulated by 1,25D3, as cycloheximide completely blocked 1,25D3-induced expression of AvBDs. Our observations suggest that 1,25D3 is capable of inducing AvBD gene expression and is a potential antibiotic alternative through augmentation of host innate immunity as well as disease control in chickens."

Our objective was to determine the incidence of individual tumour types for seven individual ethnic groups. Methods We used data from the National Cancer Intelligence Network on tumour site, age, sex and deprivation to identify 42,207 tumour cases. Self-reported ethnicity was obtained from the Hospital Episode Statistics database. We used mid-year population estimates from the Office for National Statistics. We analysed tumours by site using Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios comparing non-White ethnicities to Whites after adjustment for sex, age and deprivation. Results Our study showed differences in tumour incidence by ethnicity for gliomas, meningiomas, pituitary tumours and cranial and paraspinal nerve tumours. Relative to Whites; South Asians, Blacks and Chinese have a lower incidence of gliomas (p<0.01), with respective incidence rate ratios of 0.68 (confidence interval: 0.60–0.77), 0.62 (0.52–0.73) and 0.58 (0.41–0.83). Blacks have a higher incidence of meningioma (p<0.01) with an incidence rate ratio of 1.29 (1.05–1.59) and there is heterogeneity in meningioma incidence between individual South Asian ethnicities. Blacks have a higher incidence of pituitary tumours relative to Whites (p<0.01) with an incidence rate ratio of 2.95 (2.37–3.67). There is heterogeneity in pituitary tumour incidence between individual South Asian ethnicities. Conclusions We present incidence data of individual tumour types for seven ethnic groups. Current understanding of the aetiology of these tumours cannot explain our results. These findings suggest avenues for further work."
https://openalex.org/W2346417257,"We previously screened the novel gene Ds-26-16 from a 4 M salt-stressed Dunaliella salina cDNA library and discovered that this gene conferred salt tolerance to broad-spectrum organisms, including E. coli (Escherichia coli), Haematococcus pluvialis and tobacco. To determine the mechanism of this gene conferring salt tolerance, we studied the proteome of E. coli overexpressing the full-length cDNA of Ds-26-16 using the iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification) approach. A total of 1,610 proteins were identified, which comprised 39.4% of the whole proteome. Of the 559 differential proteins, 259 were up-regulated and 300 were down-regulated. GO (gene ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes) enrichment analyses identified 202 major proteins, including those involved in amino acid and organic acid metabolism, energy metabolism, carbon metabolism, ROS (reactive oxygen species) scavenging, membrane proteins and ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporters, and peptidoglycan synthesis, as well as 5 up-regulated transcription factors. Our iTRAQ data suggest that Ds-26-16 up-regulates the transcription factors in E. coli to enhance salt resistance through osmotic balance, energy metabolism, and oxidative stress protection. Changes in the proteome were also observed in E. coli overexpressing the ORF (open reading frame) of Ds-26-16. Furthermore, pH, nitric oxide and glycerol content analyses indicated that Ds-26-16 overexpression increases nitric oxide content but has no effect on glycerol content, thus confirming that enhanced nitric oxide synthesis via lower intercellular pH was one of the mechanisms by which Ds-26-16 confers salt tolerance to E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2345494564,"Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the combination of oral vinorelbine with erlotinib using the conventional (CSV) and metronomic (MSV) dosing schedules in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods This was an open-label, multiple dose-escalation phase I study. An alternating 3+3 phase I design was employed to allow each schedule to enroll three patients sequentially at each dose level. Thirty patients with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were treated with escalating doses of oral vinorelbine starting at 40 mg/m2 on day 1 and 8 in the CSV group (N = 16) and at 100 mg/week in the MSV group (N = 14). Erlotinib was administered orally daily. Results The maximum tolerated dose was vinorelbine 80 mg/m2 with erlotinib 100 mg in the CSV group and vinorelbine 120 mg/week with erlotinib 100 mg in the MSV group. Grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia (N = 2; 13%) and hyponatremia (N = 1; 6%) in the CSV group, and neutropenia (N = 5; 36%) in the MSV group. Objective response was achieved in 38% and 29% in the CSV and MSV groups respectively. Vinorelbine co-administration did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of erlotinib and OSI-420 after initial dose. However, at steady-state, significantly higher Cmax, higher Cmin and lower CL/F of erlotinib were observed with increasing dose levels of vinorelbine in the CSV group. Significantly higher steady-state Cmin, Cavg and AUCss of erlotinib were observed with increasing dose levels of vinorelbine in the MSV group. Conclusions Combination of oral vinorelbine with erlotinib is feasible and tolerable in both the CSV and MSV groups. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00702182"
https://openalex.org/W2346814628,"MiRNAs have been reported as CIS-acting elements of several hemostatic factors, however, their mechanism as TRANS-acting elements mediated by a transcription factor is little known and could have important effects. HNF4α has a direct and important role in the regulation of multiple hepatic coagulation genes. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that miR-24-3p and miR-34a-5p regulate HNF4A expression. Here we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of miR-24 and miR-34a on coagulation through HNF4A. Transfections with miR-24 and miR-34a in HepG2 cells decreased not only HNF4A but also F10, F12, SERPINC1, PROS1, PROC, and PROZ transcripts levels. Positive and significant correlations were observed between levels of HNF4A and several hemostatic factors (F5, F8, F9, F11, F12, SERPINC1, PROC, and PROS1) in human liver samples (N = 104). However, miR-24 and miR-34a levels of the low (10th) and high (90th) percentiles of those liver samples were inversely correlated with HNF4A and almost all hemostatic factors expression levels. These outcomes suggest that miR-24 and miR-34a might be two indirect elements of regulation of several hemostatic factors. Additionally, variations in miRNA expression profiles could justify, at least in part, changes in HNF4A expression levels and its downstream targets of coagulation."
https://openalex.org/W2346593858,"Epidemiological studies indicate that metformin, a widely used type 2 diabetes drug, might reduce breast cancer risk and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. Metformin might protect against breast cancer indirectly by ameliorating systemic glucose homeostasis. Alternatively, it might target breast cancer cells directly. However, experiments using MDA-MB-231 cells, a standard in vitro breast cancer model, produced inconsistent results regarding effectiveness of metformin as a direct anti-cancer agent. Metformin treatments in cultured MDA-MB-231 cells are usually performed for 48-96 hours, but protocols describing renewal of cell culture medium during these prolonged treatments are rarely reported. We determined whether medium renewal protocol might alter sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with metformin. Using the MTS assay, BrdU incorporation and Hoechst staining we found that treatment with metformin for 48-72 hours failed to suppress viability and proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells if low-glucose (1 g/L) medium was renewed every 24 hours. Conversely, metformin suppressed their viability and proliferation if medium was not renewed. Without renewal glucose concentration in the medium was reduced to 0.1 g/L in 72 hours, which likely explains increased sensitivity to metformin under these conditions. We also examined whether 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) reduces resistance to metformin. In the presence of 2-DG metformin reduced viability and proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells with or without medium renewal, thus demonstrating that 2-DG reduces their resistance to metformin. In sum, we show that medium renewal blocks anti-proliferative effects of metformin during prolonged treatments in low-glucose medium. Differences in medium renewal protocols during prolonged treatments might therefore lead to apparently inconsistent results as regards effectiveness of metformin as a direct anti-cancer agent. Finally, our results indicate that co-therapy with 2-DG and metformin might provide an effective strategy to overcome metformin resistance of breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2346828652,"Constricted cerebral venous outflow has been linked with increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulsatility in the aqueduct of Sylvius in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and healthy individuals. This study investigates the relationship between CSF pulsatility and internal jugular vein (IJV) cross-sectional area (CSA) in these two groups, something previously unknown.65 relapsing-remitting MS patients (50.8% female; mean age = 43.8 years) and 74 healthy controls (HCs) (54.1% female; mean age = 43.9 years) were investigated. CSF flow quantification was performed on cine phase-contrast MRI, while IJV-CSA was calculated using magnetic resonance venography. Statistical analysis involved correlation, and partial least squares correlation analysis (PLSCA).PLSCA revealed a significant difference (p<0.001; effect size = 1.072) between MS patients and HCs in the positive relationship between CSF pulsatility and IJV-CSA at C5-T1, something not detected at C2-C4. Controlling for age and cardiovascular risk factors, statistical trends were identified in HCs between: increased net positive CSF flow (NPF) and increased IJV-CSA at C5-C6 (left: r = 0.374, p = 0.016; right: r = 0.364, p = 0.019) and C4 (left: r = 0.361, p = 0.020); and increased net negative CSF flow and increased left IJV-CSA at C5-C6 (r = -0.348, p = 0.026) and C4 (r = -0.324, p = 0.039), whereas in MS patients a trend was only identified between increased NPF and increased left IJV-CSA at C5-C6 (r = 0.351, p = 0.021). Overall, correlations were weaker in MS patients (p = 0.015).In healthy adults, increased CSF pulsatility is associated with increased IJV-CSA in the lower cervix (independent of age and cardiovascular risk factors), suggesting a biomechanical link between the two. This relationship is altered in MS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2346378174,"Although it is well accepted that there is a close relationship between hypothyroidism and depression, previous studies provided inconsistent or even opposite results in whether subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) increased the risk of depression. One possible reason is that the etiology of SCH in these studies was not clearly distinguished. We therefore investigated the relationship between SCH resulting from 131I treatment of Graves' disease and depression.The incidence of depression among 95 patients with SCH and 121 euthyroid patients following 131I treatment of Graves' disease was studied. The risk factors of depression were determined with multivariate logistic regression analysis. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy was performed in patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels exceeding 10 mIU/L.Patients with SCH had significantly higher Hamilton Depression Scale scores, serum TSH and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) levels compared with euthyroid patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed SCH, Graves' eye syndrome and high serum TPO antibody level as risk factors for depression. L-thyroxine treatment is beneficial for SCH patients with serum TSH levels exceeding 10 mIU/L.The results of the present study demonstrated that SCH is prevalent among 131I treated Graves' patients. SCH might increase the risk of developing depression. L-thyroxine replacement therapy helps to resolve depressive disorders in SCH patients with TSH > 10mIU/L. These data provide insight into the relationship between SCH and depression."
https://openalex.org/W2346106327,"Background & Aims Simple steatosis (SS) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are subtypes of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and the pathogenic differences between SS and NASH remain unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, non-coding, short RNAs that regulate gene expression. The aim of this study was to use animal models and human samples to examine the relationship between miRNA expression profiles and each type of NAFLD (SS and NASH). Methods DD Shionogi, Fatty Liver Shionogi (FLS) and FLS ob/ob mice were used as models for normal control, SS and NASH, respectively. Microarray analysis and real-time PCR were used to identify candidate NAFLD-related miRNAs. Human serum samples were used to examine the expression profiles of these candidate miRNAs in control subjects and patients with SS or NASH. Results Fourteen miRNAs showed clear expression differences among liver tissues from SS, NASH, and control mice with good reproducibility. Among these NAFLD candidate miRNAs, seven showed similar expression patterns and were upregulated in both SS and NASH tissues; these seven candidate miRNAs mapped to an miRNA cluster in the 14q32.2 maternally imprinted region delineated by delta-like homolog 1 and type III iodothyronine deiodinase (Dlk1-Dio3 mat). Software-based predictions indicated that the transforming growth factor-β pathway, insulin like growth factor-1 and 5' adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase were potential targets of theses Dlk1-Dio3 mat NAFLD candidate miRNAs. In addition, serum samples from patients with SS or NASH differed markedly with regard to expression of the putative Dlk1-Dio3 mat miRNAs, and these differences accurately corresponded with NAFLD diagnosis. Conclusion The expression profiles of seven miRNAs in 14q32.2 mat have high potential as biomarkers for NAFLD and for improving future research on the pathogenesis and treatment of NASH."
https://openalex.org/W2345847483,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the internal consistency, structural validity, sensitivity and specificity of the 5- and 4-item versions of the LATCH assessment tool among a multiethnic population in Singapore.The study was a secondary analysis of a subset of data (n = 907) from our previous breastfeeding survey from 2013 to 2014. The internal consistency of the LATCH was examined using Cronbach's alpha. The structural validity was assessed using an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and the proposed factors were confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using separate samples. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the LATCH score thresholds for predicting non-exclusive breastfeeding.The Cronbach's alpha values of the 5- and 4-item LATCH assessments were 0.70 and 0.74, respectively. The EFA demonstrated a one-factor structure for the 5- and 4-item LATCH assessments among a randomized split of 334 vaginally delivered women. Two CFA of the 4-item LATCH demonstrated better fit indices of the models compared to the two CFA of the 5-item LATCH among another randomized split of 335 vaginally delivered women and 238 cesarean delivered women. Using cutoffs of 5.5 and 3.5 were recommended when predicting non-exclusive breastfeeding for 5- and 4-item versions of the LATCH assessment among vaginally delivered women (n = 669), with satisfactory sensitivities (94% and 95%), low specificities (0% and 2%), low positive predictive values (25%) and negative predictive values (20% and 47%). A cutoff of 5.5 was recommended to predict non-exclusive breastfeeding for 5- and 4-item versions among cesarean delivered women (n = 238) with satisfactory sensitivities (93% and 98%), low specificities (4% and 9%), low positive predictive values (41%) and negative predictive values (65% and 75%). Therefore, the tool has good sensitivity but poor specificity, positive and negative predictive values.We found that the 4-item version demonstrated sound psychometric properties compared to the 5-item version. Health professionals can use the 4-item LATCH as a clinical tool because it is a concise, easy-to-use and valid tool for assessing breastfeeding techniques among a multiethnic population."
https://openalex.org/W2347029040,"Background Post-exercise heart rate recovery (HRR) is an index of parasympathetic function associated with clinical outcome in patients with chronic heart failure. However, its relationship with the pro-inflammatory response and prognostic value in consecutive patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) has not been investigated. Methods We measured HRR and pro-inflammatory markers in 107 prospectively and consecutively enrolled, recovered ADHF patients (71 male, 59 ± 15 years, mean ejection fraction 28.9 ± 14.2%) during the pre-discharge period. The primary endpoint included cardiovascular (CV) events defined as CV mortality, cardiac transplantation, or rehospitalization due to HF aggravation. Results The CV events occurred in 30 (28.0%) patients (5 cardiovascular deaths and 7 cardiac transplantations) during the follow-up period (median 214 days, 11–812 days). When the patients with ADHF were grouped by HRR according to the Contal and O’Quigley’s method, low HRR was shown to be associated with significantly higher levels of serum monokine-induced by gamma interferon (MIG) and poor clinical outcome. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that low HRR was an independent predictor of CV events in both enter method and stepwise method. The addition of HRR to a model significantly increased predictability for CV events across the entire follow-up period. Conclusion Impaired post-exercise HRR is associated with a pro-inflammatory response and independently predicts clinical outcome in patients with ADHF. These findings may explain the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and clinical outcome in terms of the inflammatory response in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2345814089,"IFN orchestrates the expression of various genes to halt hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication with the possibility of either reduced or increased liver fibrosis; due to controlled viral replication or overproduction of inflammatory mediators, repectively. In this study, we examined the transcriptional profiling of type I IFN related genes in HCV-chronically infected patients with varying degrees of liver fibrosis. PCR array was used to examine the expression of 84 type I IFN related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) RNA from 12 treatment-naïve chronic HCV patients (5 F0-F1 and 7 F2-F4) and 5 healthy subjects. We further validated our results by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) in 103 treatment-naïve chronic HCV patients (43 F0-F1 and 60 F2-F4) and 15 controls. PCR array data revealed dysregulation in TLR7 pathway. The expression of TLR7 was decreased by 4 folds and MyD88 was increased by 3 folds in PBMCs of F2-F4 patients when compared to the healthy volunteers (p = 0.03 and 0.002, respectively). In addition, IRF7 and TLR7 showed dramatic downregulation (6 and 8 folds, respectively) in F2-F4 patients when compared to F0-F1 ones. qRT-PCR confirmed the altered expression patterns of TLR7 and MyD88 in F2-F4 patients when compared to either controls or F0-F1 patients. However, by qRT-PCR, IRF7 and NF-κB1 (TLR7 pathway transcription factors) exhibited similar mRNA abundance among F2-F4 and F0-F1 patients. These results suggest that TLR7 and MyD88 are possible candidates as biomarkers for the progression of HCV-induced liver fibrosis and/ or targets for therapeutic intervention."

In both cohorts, cord blood was collected at delivery.A total of 92 twin pairs were enrolled (n = 49 in Cohort 1; n = 43 in Cohort 2). In Cohort 1, the concentrations of adiponectin (median, 68.5 ng/mL vs 61.4 ng/mL; p<0.05) and leptin (median, 13.9 ng/mL vs 11.2 ng/mL; p<0.1) in mid-trimester AF were significantly higher in smaller compared with larger twins. In Cohort 2, the concentration of serpin E1 (median, 246.0 ng/mL vs 182.8 ng/mL; p<0.01) in AF at delivery was significantly higher in smaller twins, but no difference was noted in adiponectin and leptin concentrations. Levels of adiponectin (median, 10425.5 ng/mL vs 11552.0 ng/mL; p<0.005) and leptin (median, 2.1 ng/mL vs 2.6 ng/mL; p<0.005) were significantly lower in the cord blood of smaller twins whereas cord blood concentrations of serpin E1 (median, 15.5 ng/mL vs 13.3 ng/mL; p<0.05) was higher in the smaller twins.In discordant DCDA twin pairs, concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, and serpin E1 in mid-trimester AF, AF at delivery, and cord blood at birth vary significantly but predictably between the smaller and larger twins."

This study was performed to identify factors associated with satisfactory changes in physical function after orthopedic surgery. Methods 358 patients were selected for the questionnaire survey. The following information was collected: gender, primary disease, age of initial surgery, total procedural count, operated sites, satisfaction of postoperative rehabilitation frequency, ideal amount of postoperative rehabilitation sessions per week, frequency of voluntary home training per week, satisfaction of the timing of surgery and the current satisfaction with the changes in physical function after the orthopedic surgery. We classified the patients into the satisfied and dissatisfied group according to satisfactory changes in physical function after the surgery. We performed unpaired t-tests and chi-square tests to determine the variables that differed significantly between the groups. Variables with a p value of <0.2 were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results The logistic model was revised and summed up to two potential predictors of postsurgical satisfaction with physical function: satisfaction with the frequency of postoperative rehabilitation sessions and the orthopedic surgery of the hip (distinction hit ratio, 75.4%). Conclusions This study demonstrated that the frequency of postoperative rehabilitation and history of hip surgery seemed to be related to the satisfaction with the changes in physical function after orthopedic surgery."

https://openalex.org/W2345815003,"Although Streptococcal bacteremia is common in diarrheal children with high morbidity and mortality, no systematic data are available on Streptococcal bacteremia in diarrheal children. We sought to evaluate the factors associated with Streptococcal bacteremia in diarrheal children under five years of age and their outcome.We used an unmatched case-control design to investigate the associated factors with Streptococcal bacteremia in all the diarrheal children under five years of age through electronic medical record system of Dhaka hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. We had simultaneously used a retrospective cohort design to further evaluate the outcome of our study children. All the enrolled children had their blood culture done between January 2010 and December 2012. Comparison was made among the children with (cases = 26) and without Streptococcal bacteremia (controls = 78). Controls were selected randomly from hospitalized diarrheal children under five years of age.Cases had proportionately higher deaths compared to controls, but it was statistically insignificant (15% vs. 10%, p = 0.49). The cases more often presented with severe dehydration, fever, respiratory distress, severe sepsis, and abnormal mental status compared to the controls (for all p<0.05). In the logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for potential confounders, it has been found that Streptococcal bacteremia in diarrheal children under five years of age was independently associated with nutritional edema (OR: 5.86, 95% CI = 1.28-26.80), hypoxemia (OR: 19.39, 95% CI = 2.14-175.91), fever (OR: 4.44, 95% CI = 1.13-17.42), delayed capillary refill time (OR: 7.00, 95% CI = 1.36-35.93), and respiratory distress (OR: 2.69, 95% CI = 1.02-7.12).The results of our analyses suggest that diarrheal children under five years of age presenting with nutritional edema, hypoxemia, fever, delayed capillary refill time, and respiratory distress may be at risk of Streptococcal bacteremia. It underscores the importance of identification of these simple clinical parameters for the prompt recognition and management in order to reduce the morbidity and death of such children especially in resource limited settings."
