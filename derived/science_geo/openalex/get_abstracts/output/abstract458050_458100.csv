We conclude that cell-type-specific chromatin organization occurs at the submegabase scale and that architectural proteins shape the genome in hierarchical length scales. Genomes are organized at multiple length scales into sophisticated higher-order architectures (Misteli, 2007Misteli T. Beyond the sequence: cellular organization of genome function.Cell. 2007; 128: 787-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Individual chromosomes occupy distinct spatial territories with respect to each other in interphase nuclei (Cremer and Cremer, 2001Cremer T. Cremer C. Chromosome territories, nuclear architecture and gene regulation in mammalian cells.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). Within each territory, at intermediate length scales of ∼1–10 Mb, compartments of transcriptionally active euchromatin tend to group together, and independent from, compartments of inactive heterochromatin (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009Lieberman-Aiden E. van Berkum N.L.

At the subcompartment level, chromatin is further organized into megabase-sized topologically associating domains (TADs) that represent spatial neighborhoods of high-frequency chromatin interactions (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R.

Within TADs, however, the precise features of chromatin folding at the submegabase scale remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that nuclear architecture is critically important for cellular function. Seminal microscopy studies have linked the spatial positioning of specific genomic loci to gene expression (Fraser and Bickmore, 2007Fraser P. Bickmore W.

Moreover, molecular methods based on proximity ligation, such as chromosome conformation capture (3C) or circularized-3C (4C), have been used to detect functional long-range interactions between two specific genomic loci in a population of cells (Dekker et al., 2002Dekker J.

Principles from these studies have been difficult to generalize, however, because most previous reports focus on interrogation of 3D interactions between specific preselected fragments (Kurukuti et al., 2006Kurukuti S.

More recently, technologies for genome-wide mapping of chromatin architecture have been described, but comprehensive detection comes at the expense of resolution for mammalian genomes (Hi-C) (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B. Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3955) Google Scholar; Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009Lieberman-Aiden E. van Berkum N.L.

Dorschner M.O. et al.Comprehensive mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome.Science. 2009; 326: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (4868) Google Scholar) or is restricted to only interactions mediated by a preselected protein of interest (ChIA-PET) (Handoko et al., 2011Handoko L. Xu H. Li G. Ngan C.Y. Chew E. Schnapp M. Lee C.W. Ye C. Ping J.L. Mulawadi F. et al.CTCF-mediated functional chromatin interactome in pluripotent cells.Nat.

Zhang J. et al.Extensive promoter-centered chromatin interactions provide a topological basis for transcription regulation.Cell. 2012; 148: 84-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a great need to elucidate principles of genome folding at the submegabase scale by mapping 3D chromatin interactions in an unbiased manner at high resolution. Megabase-scale TADs appear to be constant between mammalian cell types and conserved across species (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B. Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3955) Google Scholar; Nora et al., 2012Nora E.P. Lajoie B.R. Schulz E.G. Giorgetti L. Okamoto I. Servant N. Piolot T. van Berkum N.L. Meisig J. Sedat J. et al.Spatial partitioning of the regulatory landscape of the X-inactivation centre.Nature. 2012; 485: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that genome organization at the submegabase scale, e.g., within TADs, plays a critical role in the establishment and/or maintenance of cellular state. To test this hypothesis, we present an unbiased, large-scale, and high-resolution analysis of 3D chromatin architecture in a continuous developmental system. We employed chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) (Dostie et al., 2006Dostie J. Richmond T.A. Arnaout R.A. Selzer R.R. Lee W.L. Honan T.A. Rubio E.D. Krumm A. Lamb J. Nusbaum C. et al.Chromosome Conformation Capture Carbon Copy (5C): a massively parallel solution for mapping interactions between genomic elements.Genome Res. 2006; 16: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) in combination with high-throughput sequencing to map higher-order chromatin organization during differentiation of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) cells along the neuroectoderm lineage. An alternating 5C primer design was applied to query long-range chromatin interactions in a massively parallel manner across six 1–2 Mb-sized genomic regions around key developmentally regulated genes (Oct4, Nanog, Nestin, Sox2, Klf4, and Olig1-Olig2). Our analyses reveal that distinct combinations of architectural proteins shape the 3D organization of mammalian genomes at different length scales for unique functional purposes during lineage commitment. To investigate cell-type-specific patterns of higher-order chromatin organization, we first derived homogeneous populations of multipotent neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from mouse ES cells using a well-established, four-stage procedure (Mikkelsen et al., 2007Mikkelsen T.S. Ku M. Jaffe D.B. Issac B. Lieberman E. Giannoukos G. Alvarez P. Brockman W. Kim T.K. Koche R.P. et al.Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in pluripotent and lineage-committed cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar; Okabe et al., 1996Okabe S. Forsberg-Nilsson K. Spiro A.C. Segal M. McKay R.D. Development of neuronal precursor cells and functional postmitotic neurons from embryonic stem cells in vitro.Mech. Dev. 1996; 59: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). qRT-PCR analysis and confocal microscopy coupled with immunofluorescence staining confirmed a >95% pure population of Nestin/Sox2-postitive, Oct4/Nanog-negative cells displaying morphological characteristic of NPCs (Figure S1 available online). We then employed 5C in combination with high-throughput sequencing to generate high-resolution long-range interaction maps for two biological replicates of ES cells and ES-derived NPCs (Dostie et al., 2006Dostie J. Richmond T.A. Arnaout R.A. Selzer R.R. Lee W.L. Honan T.A. Rubio E.D. Krumm A. Lamb J. Nusbaum C. et al.Chromosome Conformation Capture Carbon Copy (5C): a massively parallel solution for mapping interactions between genomic elements.Genome Res. 2006; 16: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). 5C, a high-throughput derivative of 3C, involves the selective amplification of chromatin interactions within specific genomic loci of interest. By preselecting regions to be queried, we were able to obtain insight into chromatin architecture at the resolution of single interrogated fragments (∼4 kb), which is not yet feasible in a cost-effective manner with genome-wide Hi-C technologies in mammalian systems. Forward and reverse 5C primers were designed in an alternating scheme using tools from the publicly available my5C suite (Lajoie et al., 2009Lajoie B.R. van Berkum N.L. Sanyal A. Dekker J. My5C: web tools for chromosome conformation capture studies.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 690-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Figure S2E). The tiled, alternating design queried ∼90,000 cis and ∼500,000 trans interactions in parallel across seven genomic loci surrounding developmentally regulated genes (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Klf4, Nestin, Olig1-Olig2, and gene-desert control) (Table S1). We first evaluated the quality of our raw 5C data by (1) assessing consistency between biological replicates and (2) comparing our high-resolution 5C data to Hi-C data recently reported at 40 kb resolution for E14 ES cells and primary cells isolated from mouse cortex (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B. Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3955) Google Scholar). Raw 5C counts were highly correlated between replicates (ES 1 versus ES 2, Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.91; NPC 1 versus NPC 2, Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.89) and more correlated than between ES cells and NPCs (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.70) when considering the log of counts for all fragment combinations with >100 reads. Furthermore, heatmaps of raw 5C data showed high similarity between biological replicates at each individual locus (Figure S2F), suggesting that region-specific primers amplified each region in a robust and consistent manner. Importantly, we also observe a striking similarity between global topological features in 5C and Hi-C data for all regions queried, albeit with marked differences in resolution (Figure S3). These results indicate that our 5C libraries are high quality, consistent between replicates, and achieve notable similarity to data generated with an independent method (Hi-C) in an independent study with similar cellular phenotypes. We next examined large-scale architectural features by visualizing heatmaps of 5C counts in ES cells and NPCs (Figures 1C and 1F ). Comparison of high-resolution 5C maps to Hi-C maps at each region revealed a complex hierarchy of chromatin organization. TADs are readily detected in both Hi-C and 5C data sets. Importantly, the higher resolution of 5C data revealed that TADs previously defined with Hi-C are further subdivided into smaller subtopologies (sub-TADs). We systematically identified sub-TADs in 5C data with a Hidden Markov Model-based approach (Extended Experimental Procedures). Using this method, we uncovered numerous distinct subtopologies arranged in a hierarchy within the larger TAD organization. Indeed, >60 invariant and cell-type-specific sub-TAD boundaries were identified with our 5C data at the submegabase scale, whereas only 7 TAD boundaries were called in our regions of interest with a previous Hi-C analysis (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B. Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3955) Google Scholar) (Figures 1G and 1H). Topological features were unique to each region (Figure S3), suggesting that each genomic locus has an architectural signature that may reflect the functional activity of that region. Taken together, these data demonstrate that 5C achieves a marked increase in resolution compared to Hi-C, which enables mapping of finer-scale architectural features within TADs. Our observation that submegabase-scale architectural features undergo marked changes between cell types prompted us to systematically identify constitutive and cell-type-specific looping interactions within and between larger-scale TADs. To account for bias intrinsic to all 3C-based methods, as well as to 5C specifically, we developed a probabilistic model that simultaneously captures the distance-dependent background level of nonspecific chromatin interactions and the nonbiological contribution from each primer (Imakaev et al., 2012Imakaev M. Fudenberg G. McCord R.P. Naumova N. Goloborodko A. Lajoie B.R. Dekker J. Mirny L.A. Iterative correction of Hi-C data reveals hallmarks of chromosome organization.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar; Yaffe and Tanay, 2011Yaffe E. Tanay A. Probabilistic modeling of Hi-C contact maps eliminates systematic biases to characterize global chromosomal architecture.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) (Extended Experimental Procedures). Our model produces an interaction score that is comparable within and between experiments and allows for robust detection of fragment-to-fragment looping interactions that are significant above the expected background signal (Figure S4). 3D contacts with interaction scores greater than stringent, pre-established thresholds in both biological replicates were subjected to further analysis (Figure 2A). To rigorously minimize false positives, thresholds were selected so that the large majority of cell-type-specific interactions were lost when randomly permuting data (Figure 2B). By applying these stringent thresholds, we identified 83 ES-cell-specific interactions that are lost upon differentiation, 260 constitutive interactions that are constant between cell types, and 165 NPC-specific interactions that are absent in ES cells and acquired upon differentiation (Figure 2C). Thus, only cell-type-specific architectural features corresponding to the top 0.096% and 0.190% of all queried interactions in ES and NPC libraries, respectively, were considered for downstream analysis. We next integrated 5C data with other epigenomic data sets. We observed that a significant proportion of fragments engaged in 3D interactions were occupied by specific histone modifications. For example, a series of ∼80- to 120-kb-sized looping interactions connect the Sox2 gene with a putative downstream enhancer in ES cells marked by H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and low levels of H3K4me3 (Creyghton et al., 2010Creyghton M.P.

A unique chromatin signature uncovers early developmental enhancers in humans.Nature. 2011; 470: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar) (Figure 2D). Loss of enhancer marks in NPCs occured in parallel with loss of ES-specific looping interactions, suggesting that this particular chromatin conformation has important functional significance. Similarly, an ES-specific interaction connects the Pou5f1/Oct4 gene to a putative enhancer ∼25 kb upstream marked by H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and low levels of H3K4me3 (Figure 2E). By contrast, we detected a hierarchy of constitutive interactions (constant between cell types) around the pluripotent genes Nanog and Slc2a3 despite changes in gene activity during differentiation (Figure 2F). These examples provide evidence that a notable proportion of looping interactions identified in this study may be involved in genome function. To gain more insight into organizing principles governing genome folding, we integrated 5C data with genome-wide maps of protein occupancy. We first examined factors that have been reported as both essential for cellular functions and correlated with a specific looping interactions using 3C technology. The top three candidates fulfilling these criteria were CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), cohesin, and Mediator (Hadjur et al., 2009Hadjur S. Williams L.M. Ryan N.K. Cobb B.S. Sexton T. Fraser P.

CTCF mediates long-range chromatin looping and local histone modification in the beta-globin locus.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Genome-wide binding sites for CTCF, mediator subunit Med12, and cohesin subunit Smc1 have been previously identified in ES cells by ChIP-seq (Kagey et al., 2010Kagey M.H. Newman J.J. Bilodeau S. Zhan Y. Orlando D.A. van Berkum N.L. Ebmeier C.C. Goossens J. Rahl P.B.

Gaidatzis D. et al.DNA-binding factors shape the mouse methylome at distal regulatory regions.Nature. 2011; 480: 490-495PubMed Google Scholar). We first used the ChIP-seq data to quantify unique and overlapping occupied sites in our regions of interest. As previously reported, high-confidence Smc1 binding sites significantly overlapped high-confidence CTCF and Med12 binding sites (Kagey et al., 2010Kagey M.H. Newman J.J. Bilodeau S. Zhan Y. Orlando D.A. van Berkum N.L. Ebmeier C.C. Goossens J. Rahl P.B. Levine S.S. et al.Mediator and cohesin connect gene expression and chromatin architecture.Nature. 2010; 467: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). However, in addition to Med12+Smc1 and CTCF+Smc1 co-occupied sites, we also found notable subclasses of CTCF alone and Med12 alone both genome wide and in our regions of interest in ES cells (Figures 3A and 3B ). Noteworthy, Med12 rarely overlaps CTCF in the absence of cohesin, but a subclass with occupancy of all three proteins (i.e., Med12+Smc1+CTCF) does emerge as significant. We next examined the enrichment of CTCF, Med12, and Smc1 in 5C looping interactions. Unsupervised cluster analysis demonstrated that >80% of significant interactions were anchored by some combination of CTCF, Med12, or Smc1 in ES cells, which is significantly higher than the enrichment of these proteins in all queried background interactions (Figure 3C). By contrast, only ∼40% of interactions were occupied by some combination of Oct4, Nanog, and/or Sox2, which is not significant compared to the expected background enrichment of these proteins (Figure 3D). The widespread occupancy of CTCF, Med12, and Smc1 in 3D interactions led us to hypothesize that these three proteins might have important architectural roles in shaping 3D genome organization. We next explored the specific role for each candidate architectural protein subclass in genome organization. We observed a striking pattern in which multiple adjacent binding sites for the same architectural protein subclass were often found at the base of significant interactions. Indeed, enrichment for a particular architectural subclass in 3D interactions showed a strong correlation with the number of binding sites (Figure 3E). Therefore, to explore only high-confidence interactions, we focused our analysis on only loops anchored by >2 or >3 co-occupied sites (Figure 3F). CTCF+Smc1 and CTCF alone subclasses were highly overrepresented at the base of constitutive interactions compared to background nonloops (Figure 3F). By contrast, Med12+Smc1 and Med12 alone subclasses were predominantly enriched in only ES-specific looping interactions. Intriguingly, sites co-occupied by Med12+CTCF+Smc1 showed enrichment in both constitutive and ES-cell-specific interactions. We also noticed that interactions mediated by each candidate architectural subclass displayed markedly different size distributions (Figure 4A). Med12+Smc1 co-occupied sites were predominately enriched at the smallest <100 kb length scale (Figure 4B), whereas Med12 alone sites, independent from cohesin, were enriched at intermediate length scales of 600–1,000 kb (Figure 4D). The subclass with all three proteins (Med12+CTCF+Smc1) also displayed a loop size distribution shifted toward small to intermediate (<300 kb) length scales (Figure 4C). By contrast, loops connected by CTCF+Smc1 and CTCF Alone subclasses were significantly biased toward interactions greater than 1 Mb in size (Figures 4E and 4F). Together, these results support our hypothesis that architectural protein subclasses function at different length scales to fulfill distinct roles in genome organization. To further explore the molecular mechanisms regulating constitutive chromatin interactions, we mapped CTCF and Smc1 occupancy in NPCs using ChIP-seq. Genomic loci co-occupied by CTCF and Smc1 in both ES cells and NPCs represented the largest architectural subclass genome wide and in our regions of interest (n = 159) (Figures 5A and 5B ). Moreover, the sites with constant occupancy of CTCF+Smc1 between cell types were highly enriched in constitutive interactions compared to background (Figure 5C). This result is illustrated with a series of loops around Nanog and Slc2a3 (Figure 2F) and Olig1 and Olig2 (Figure 5D). At both genomic loci, fragments anchoring the base of const"
https://openalex.org/W2033998652,"To learn more about cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), we have isolated fibroblasts from different stages of breast cancer progression and analysed their function and gene expression. These analyses reveal that activation of the YAP transcription factor is a signature feature of CAFs. YAP function is required for CAFs to promote matrix stiffening, cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis. Remodelling of the ECM and promotion of cancer cell invasion requires the actomyosin cytoskeleton. YAP regulates the expression of several cytoskeletal regulators, including ANLN and DIAPH3, and controls the protein levels of MYL9 (also known as MLC2). Matrix stiffening further enhances YAP activation, thus establishing a feed-forward self-reinforcing loop that helps to maintain the CAF phenotype. Actomyosin contractility and Src function are required for YAP activation by stiff matrices. Further, transient ROCK inhibition is able to disrupt the feed-forward loop, leading to a long-lasting reversion of the CAF phenotype. Sahai and colleagues report that YAP is required for the establishment and function of cancer-associated fibroblasts. They propose that matrix stiffening promotes Src-mediated activation of YAP in fibroblasts, which is necessary for the cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype and further promotes matrix stiffening in a positive feedback loop."

Here the authors use optogenetic stimulation to demonstrate a causal role for temporally precise dopamine neuron signaling in cue-reward learning. Situations in which rewards are unexpectedly obtained or withheld represent opportunities for new learning. Often, this learning includes identifying cues that predict reward availability. Unexpected rewards strongly activate midbrain dopamine neurons. This phasic signal is proposed to support learning about antecedent cues by signaling discrepancies between actual and expected outcomes, termed a reward prediction error. However, it is unknown whether dopamine neuron prediction error signaling and cue-reward learning are causally linked. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated dopamine neuron activity in rats in two behavioral procedures, associative blocking and extinction, that illustrate the essential function of prediction errors in learning. We observed that optogenetic activation of dopamine neurons concurrent with reward delivery, mimicking a prediction error, was sufficient to cause long-lasting increases in cue-elicited reward-seeking behavior. Our findings establish a causal role for temporally precise dopamine neuron signaling in cue-reward learning, bridging a critical gap between experimental evidence and influential theoretical frameworks."

Our results unveil a process that synchronizes immune and hematopoietic rhythms and expand the ascribed functions of neutrophils beyond inflammation. Neutrophils are the most abundant myeloid leukocytes in mammals, and are characterized by a short lifespan of ∼12 hr in mice (Basu et al., 2002Basu S. Hodgson G. Katz M. Dunn A.R. Evaluation of role of G-CSF in the production, survival, and release of neutrophils from bone marrow into circulation.Blood. 2002; 100: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This unique feature demands the elimination of large numbers of neutrophils every day, which have been estimated to be in the order of 107 in mice and 1011 in humans (Furze and Rankin, 2008Furze R.C. Rankin S.M.

Ley K. Homeostatic regulation of blood neutrophil counts.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 5183-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In inflammatory scenarios, neutrophils recruited to injured tissues are eventually cleared by macrophages, a process that contributes to resolving inflammation and restoring homeostasis (Serhan and Savill, 2005Serhan C.N. Savill J. Resolution of inflammation: the beginning programs the end.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar; Soehnlein and Lindbom, 2010Soehnlein O. Lindbom L. Phagocyte partnership during the onset and resolution of inflammation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). In contrast, under noninflammatory situations, neutrophils are preferentially eliminated in spleen, liver, and bone marrow (BM) (Furze and Rankin, 2008Furze R.C. Rankin S.M.

Physiol. 2001; 281: L913-L921PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of neutrophil death and subsequent elimination by phagocytosis have been well characterized in vitro (Fadok et al., 1998Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W.

Invest. 1989; 83: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar), the properties and fate of circulating neutrophils that are spontaneously cleared from the circulation remain to be elucidated. Removal of dying cells serves not only to maintain organ size but also generates signals that are essential to maintain homeostasis and immune fitness, as illustrated by the development of autoimmune disease in mice that lack genes required for the elimination of apoptotic cells (Henson and Hume, 2006Henson P.M.

Savill J. Resolution of inflammation: the beginning programs the end.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). Representative of this group of genes are those coding for liver X receptors (LXRα and LXRβ), which are oxysterol-activated transcription factors that sense elevated cellular cholesterol (Calkin and Tontonoz, 2012Calkin A.C. Tontonoz P. Transcriptional integration of metabolism by the nuclear sterol-activated receptors LXR and FXR.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). LXR receptors are important transcriptional regulators in macrophages that activate or repress gene expression upon engulfment of apoptotic cells, including apoptotic neutrophils (Hong et al., 2012Hong C. Kidani Y. A-Gonzalez N. Phung T. Ito A. Rong X. Ericson K. Mikkola H. Beaven S.W. Miller L.S. et al.Coordinate regulation of neutrophil homeostasis by liver X receptors in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Under steady-state conditions, efficient clearance of neutrophils requires their active extravasation through adhesive pathways similar to those used during inflammation, including endothelial selectins (Ley et al., 2007Ley K. Laudanna C. Cybulsky M.I. Nourshargh S. Getting to the site of inflammation: the leukocyte adhesion cascade updated.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (3078) Google Scholar; Stark et al., 2005Stark M.A. Huo Y. Burcin T.L. Morris M.A. Olson T.S. Ley K. Phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils regulates granulopoiesis via IL-23 and IL-17.Immunity. 2005; 22: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Studies in mice deficient in adhesion receptors established that impaired neutrophil extravasation results in an imbalance in the homeostatic levels of G-CSF and enhanced granulopoiesis, both of which could be normalized by transfer of wild-type apoptotic neutrophils (Stark et al., 2005Stark M.A. Huo Y. Burcin T.L. Morris M.A. Olson T.S. Ley K. Phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils regulates granulopoiesis via IL-23 and IL-17.Immunity. 2005; 22: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that phagocytosis of neutrophils was part of a homeostatic loop that controlled their own levels in blood. These studies also suggested that neutrophil clearance might be a significant source of homeostatic signals able to functionally modulate the tissues and organs where they are eliminated. The BM is not only a major clearance site for dying neutrophils, but also the main hematopoietic organ in adult mammals. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) are maintained within the BM in association with different populations of stromal cells that produce CXCL12 (Mercier et al., 2011Mercier F.E. Ragu C. Scadden D.T. The bone marrow at the crossroads of blood and immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 12: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), a chemokine that controls the migration to and retention of HSPC within the BM through binding to its receptor CXCR4 (Peled et al., 1999Peled A. Petit I. Kollet O. Magid M. Ponomaryov T. Byk T. Nagler A. Ben-Hur H. Many A.

Physiological regulation of these stromal components modulates HSPC survival and trafficking, and is afforded by several mechanisms including sympathetic innervation (Katayama et al., 2006Katayama Y.

Notably, the capacity of the BM to host HSPC varies during the day; circadian reductions in the production of CXCL12 in BM during the early resting period of mice correlate with increases of HSPC in the circulation (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2008Méndez-Ferrer S. Lucas D. Battista M. Frenette P.S. Haematopoietic stem cell release is regulated by circadian oscillations.Nature. 2008; 452: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). The BM also presents circadian changes in the expression of endothelial selectins and VCAM-1, a process that favors the immigration of circulating leukocytes at night (Scheiermann et al., 2012Scheiermann C. Kunisaki Y. Lucas D. Chow A. Jang J.E. Zhang D. Hashimoto D. Merad M. Frenette P.S. Adrenergic nerves govern circadian leukocyte recruitment to tissues.Immunity. 2012; 37: 290-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Thus, the BM is uniquely characterized by nonoverlapping cycles of infiltration of mature leukocytes and emigration of immature/stem cells. Here, we have hypothesized that the physiological clearance of neutrophils within the BM triggers signals that modulate the hematopoietic niche and promote the ensuing cycles of HSPC release. We report that neutrophils that physiologically age in blood migrate to the BM at the end of the resting period in mice, are engulfed by macrophages, and modulate the size and function of the hematopoietic niche in an LXR-dependent manner. We show that, through this mechanism, neutrophils regulate the homeostatic trafficking pattern of hematopoietic precursors and allow synchronization of immune and hematopoietic rhythms. We initially sought to identify neutrophils that have remained the longest in the circulation and are primed for clearance (herein referred to as aged neutrophils). BM-derived neutrophils senesced ex vivo upregulate the expression of CXCR4, the receptor for CXCL12 that mediates their retention within and homing back to the BM (Eash et al., 2009Eash K.J. Means J.M. White D.W. Link D.C.

Physiol. 2001; 281: L913-L921PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, CD62L levels decrease as neutrophils transit in the circulation (Van Eeden et al., 1997Van Eeden S.F. Bicknell S. Walker B.A. Hogg J.C. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes L-selectin expression decreases as they age in circulation.Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H401-H408PubMed Google Scholar). Using these markers, we detected a small subpopulation of Ly6G+ neutrophils in blood that expresses relatively low levels of CD62L and high levels of CXCR4 (CD62LLO CXCR4HI) (Figure 1A). The CD62LLO CXCR4HI subset of neutrophils was markedly expanded in the blood of mice in which extravasation was prevented by genetic deficiency in endothelial selectins (PEdKO mice) or fucosyltransferase 7 (Fut7−/−), an enzyme required for the synthesis of functional selectin ligands (Frenette et al., 1996Frenette P.S. Mayadas T.N. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Wagner D.D.

Experiments using parabiotic mice showed that the CD62LLO phenotype in these mice was not due to cytokines or other factors present in their plasma (Figure S1A available online), which suggested that this subset represents physiologically aged neutrophils that remained trapped in the circulation of adhesion-deficient mice. To assess whether the CD62LLO CXCR4HI cells represent bona fide aged neutrophils, we transferred CD45.1+ CD62LHI neutrophils into CD45.2+ wild-type mice. CD62LHI cells gradually converted into CD62LLO cells so that by 8 hr CD62LHI cells had virtually disappeared from blood; in contrast, transfer of CD62LLO cells derived from PEdKO mice did not yield CD62LHI neutrophils and their number progressively declined (Figure 1C). In both cases, transferred neutrophils increased the expression of surface CXCR4 over time (Figure 1D), which confirmed the upregulation of this receptor during aging. To track the fate of endogenously produced neutrophils, we metabolically labeled myeloid precursors by injecting BrdU into wild-type mice in which neutrophil extravasation was prevented by blocking endothelial selectins with antibodies (Figure S1B). Forty-eight hours after labeling, the majority of BrdU+ neutrophils that first appeared in blood was CD62LHI and gradually became CD62LLO (Figure 1E). In vivo biotinylation of circulating cells confirmed that newly released, nonbiotinylated neutrophils were CD62LHI (Figure S1C). Thus, Ly6G+ CD62LLO cells are a population of physiologically aged neutrophils, whereas the Ly6G+ CD62LHI subset identifies those recently released from the BM. Importantly, circulating CD62LLO neutrophils did not show evidence of apoptosis (Figures S1D and S1E) and presented higher surface levels of other receptors involved in cell trafficking, including the integrins CD11b and CD49d (Figure S1F), suggesting an enhanced migratory capacity of these cells. The morphology of aged neutrophils was characterized by a marked nuclear hypersegmentation (Figure 1F) and reduced forward and side scattering properties compared to the CD62LHI subset (Figure S1G), indicating changes in cell size and granularity during aging in blood. In agreement with the increased number of CD62LLO neutrophils, a large fraction of circulating neutrophils was hypersegmented in adhesion-deficient mice (PEdKO and Fut7−/− mice; Figure 1F).Figure S1Phenotypic Characterization of Aged Neutrophils, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) The CD62LLO phenotype in PEdKO and Fut7−/− mice is due to impaired extravasation of aging neutrophils.

https://openalex.org/W2106404376,"Metabolic adaptation is essential for cell survival during nutrient deprivation. We report that eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), which is activated by AMP-kinase (AMPK), confers cell survival under acute nutrient depletion by blocking translation elongation. Tumor cells exploit this pathway to adapt to nutrient deprivation by reactivating the AMPK-eEF2K axis. Adaptation of transformed cells to nutrient withdrawal is severely compromised in cells lacking eEF2K. Moreover, eEF2K knockdown restored sensitivity to acute nutrient deprivation in highly resistant human tumor cell lines. In vivo, overexpression of eEF2K rendered murine tumors remarkably resistant to caloric restriction. Expression of eEF2K strongly correlated with overall survival in human medulloblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme. Finally, C. elegans strains deficient in efk-1, the eEF2K ortholog, were severely compromised in their response to nutrient depletion. Our data highlight a conserved role for eEF2K in protecting cells from nutrient deprivation and in conferring tumor cell adaptation to metabolic stress. PAPERCLIP:"
https://openalex.org/W1971284016,"Maintaining proper mRNA levels is a key aspect in the regulation of gene expression. The balance between mRNA synthesis and decay determines these levels. We demonstrate that most yeast mRNAs are degraded by the cytoplasmic 5'-to-3' pathway (the ""decaysome""), as proposed previously. Unexpectedly, the level of these mRNAs is highly robust to perturbations in this major pathway because defects in various decaysome components lead to transcription downregulation. Moreover, these components shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, in a manner dependent on proper mRNA degradation. In the nucleus, they associate with chromatin-preferentially ∼30 bp upstream of transcription start-sites-and directly stimulate transcription initiation and elongation. The nuclear role of the decaysome in transcription is linked to its cytoplasmic role in mRNA decay; linkage, in turn, seems to depend on proper shuttling of its components. The gene expression process is therefore circular, whereby the hitherto first and last stages are interconnected."
https://openalex.org/W2077756009,"Regnase-1 (also known as Zc3h12a and MCPIP1) is an RNase that destabilizes a set of mRNAs, including Il6 and Il12b, through cleavage of their 3' UTRs. Although Regnase-1 inactivation leads to development of an autoimmune disease characterized by T cell activation and hyperimmunoglobulinemia in mice, the mechanism of Regnase-1-mediated immune regulation has remained unclear. We show that Regnase-1 is essential for preventing aberrant effector CD4(+) T cell generation cell autonomously. Moreover, in T cells, Regnase-1 regulates the mRNAs of a set of genes, including c-Rel, Ox40, and Il2, through cleavage of their 3' UTRs. Interestingly, T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation leads to cleavage of Regnase-1 at R111 by Malt1/paracaspase, freeing T cells from Regnase-1-mediated suppression. Furthermore, Malt1 protease activity is critical for controlling the mRNA stability of T cell effector genes. Collectively, these results indicate that dynamic control of Regnase-1 expression in T cells is critical for controlling T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2023577211,"Histone acetylation plays critical roles in chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and epigenetic regulation of gene expression, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Proteasomes usually catalyze ATP- and polyubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Here, we show that the proteasomes containing the activator PA200 catalyze the polyubiquitin-independent degradation of histones. Most proteasomes in mammalian testes (“spermatoproteasomes”) contain a spermatid/sperm-specific α subunit α4 s/PSMA8 and/or the catalytic β subunits of immunoproteasomes in addition to PA200. Deletion of PA200 in mice abolishes acetylation-dependent degradation of somatic core histones during DNA double-strand breaks and delays core histone disappearance in elongated spermatids. Purified PA200 greatly promotes ATP-independent proteasomal degradation of the acetylated core histones, but not polyubiquitinated proteins. Furthermore, acetylation on histones is required for their binding to the bromodomain-like regions in PA200 and its yeast ortholog, Blm10. Thus, PA200/Blm10 specifically targets the core histones for acetylation-mediated degradation by proteasomes, providing mechanisms by which acetylation regulates histone degradation, DNA repair, and spermatogenesis."

These findings revise our understanding of the regulation of type I PI3K by showing that both RAS and RHO family GTPases directly regulate distinct ubiquitous PI3K isoforms and that RAC activates p110β downstream of GPCRs. The type I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are critical signaling proteins involved in the regulation of cell growth, survival, motility, and metabolism. In mammals, there exist four isoforms of the type I PI3K catalytic p110 subunits: α, β, γ, and δ. Of these, α and β are ubiquitously expressed, whereas γ and δ have more limited distribution, most notably in hematopoietic cells (Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2010Vanhaesebroeck B. Guillermet-Guibert J. Graupera M. Bilanges B. The emerging mechanisms of isoform-specific PI3K signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). The lipid kinase activity of p110α is regulated downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases by the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to its regulatory p85 subunit, resulting in attenuation of its autoinhibitory activity. In addition, activated RAS proteins bind directly to an N-terminal RAS-binding domain (RBD) on p110α, acting synergistically with the input from tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to optimally activate lipid kinase activity (Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1994Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J.

Proof of the pathophysiological importance of the direct interaction of RAS with p110α came from the generation of mice bearing germline mutations in the RBD of p110α, which were found to be highly resistant to mutant-RAS-induced lung and skin cancer formation (Gupta et al., 2007Gupta S. Ramjaun A.R. Haiko P. Wang Y. Warne P.H. Nicke B. Nye E. Stamp G. Alitalo K. Downward J.

The direct binding of RAS to p110γ has also been studied in detail. The 3D structure of RAS bound to p110γ has been determined, and RAS has been shown to activate the lipid kinase activity of p110γ cooperatively with input from Gβγ subunits via the regulatory p101 subunit (Pacold et al., 2000Pacold M.E. Suire S. Perisic O. Lara-Gonzalez S. Davis C.T. Walker E.H. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Eccleston J.F. Williams R.L. Crystal structure and functional analysis of Ras binding to its effector phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma.Cell. 2000; 103: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mice with mutations in the RBD of p110γ show neutrophil defects in the regulation of PI3K activity by some G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Suire et al., 2006Suire S. Condliffe A.M. Ferguson G.J. Ellson C.D. Guillou H. Davidson K. Welch H. Coadwell J. Turner M. Chilvers E.R. et al.Gbetagammas and the Ras binding domain of p110gamma are both important regulators of PI(3)Kgamma signalling in neutrophils.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). RAS also has been reported to bind and activate p110δ in vitro (Vanhaesebroeck et al., 1997Vanhaesebroeck B. Welham M.J.

USA. 1997; 94: 4330-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In addition, RBD mutations have been used to demonstrate that input of RAS binding to the single Drosophila type I PI3K is critical in insulin-pathway-controlled developmental growth (Orme et al., 2006Orme M.H. Alrubaie S. Bradley G.L. Walker C.D. Leevers S.J. Input from Ras is required for maximal PI(3)K signalling in Drosophila.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1298-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and that RAS binding is required for PI3K activation by chemoattractants in Dictyostelium (Funamoto et al., 2002Funamoto S. Meili R. Lee S. Parry L. Firtel R.A.

It appears to be relatively insensitive to activation by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase signaling but important downstream of certain GPCRs, including those for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), making p110β the only GPCR-regulated type I PI3K isoform outside the hematopoietic system (Ciraolo et al., 2008Ciraolo E.

The molecular basis of how p110β can exert these distinct functions is poorly understood. p110β is overall structurally similar to other p110 catalytic subunits and engages the very same p85 type regulatory subunits as p110α, albeit in a somewhat different way (Zhang et al., 2011Zhang X. Vadas O. Perisic O. Anderson K.E. Clark J. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Williams R.L. Structure of lipid kinase p110β/p85β elucidates an unusual SH2-domain-mediated inhibitory mechanism.Mol. Cell. 2011; 41: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Early reports have found p110β to associate with Gβγ subunits from heterotrimeric G proteins, which can directly stimulate its lipid kinase activity in vitro (Kurosu et al., 1997Kurosu H. Maehama T. Okada T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino S. Fukui Y. Ui M. Hazeki O. Katada T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29311-29317Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It has, however, remained entirely unclear whether the p110β RBD contributes to p110β activation and function, and despite the apparently similar level of relatedness between the RBDs across the four isoforms, a systematic analysis of RAS effector proteins failed to detect any activation of p110β by RAS in cotransfected cells (Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 2004Rodriguez-Viciana P. Sabatier C. McCormick F. Signaling specificity by Ras family GTPases is determined by the full spectrum of effectors they regulate.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4943-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In this report, we explore the role of p110β regulation through its RBD for PI3K signaling and function. We present extensive in vitro work to show that p110β is the only type I PI3K isoform not regulated by RAS and to identify the RHO family GTPases RAC and CDC42 as direct isoform-specific RBD interactors and activators of p110β. We go on to show that GPCRs couple to PI3K via Dock180/Elmo1-mediated RAC activation and subsequent interaction with p110β. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from p110β RBD mutant mice show reduced PI3K activity and mice are resistant to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, a pathology that has been linked with LPA signaling. These findings explain longstanding inconsistencies and revise our understanding of type I PI3K regulation by small GTP-binding proteins, providing molecular insight into the regulation and function of the ubiquitous p110β isoform. To investigate the role of RAS in regulating p110β, we set out to characterize the biochemical interaction between the two in vitro. In glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down studies using recombinant, GTPγS-loaded HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS as baits, we found strong and specific interaction between all three RAS proteins and p110α (Figure 1A). In contrast, p110β bound to none of the RAS proteins, but did bind to RAB5, a previously identified GTPase interactor of p110β (Christoforidis et al., 1999Christoforidis S. Miaczynska M. Ashman K. Wilm M. Zhao L. Yip S.C. Waterfield M.D. Backer J.M. Zerial M. Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinases are Rab5 effectors.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Mutating key residues within the RBD of p110α (T208D/K227A) abrogated RAS binding, whereas introduction of analogous mutations (see below for details) into p110β did not affect RAB5 binding. Similar results were obtained when we used recombinant full-length GST-p110/p85 complexes to pull down active RAS or RAB5 proteins (Figure 1B). Moreover, when we expressed constitutively active RAS or RAB5, along with p110α/p85 or p110β/p85 in COS7 cells, and measured PIP3-levels (Figure 1C) or steady-state phospho-AKT (Figure S1A available online) as indicators of PI3K activity, HRAS and KRAS strongly enhanced p110α activity, whereas p110β was not stimulated by either RAS proteins or RAB5.Figure S1PI 3-Kinase p110β Is Unable to Interact with RAS, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Active RAS proteins fail to stimulate p110β in cells.

FLAG-tagged p110α, p110γ and p110δ were expressed in COS7 cells along with their respective regulatory subunits p85 or p101. COS7 cell lysates were incubated with GTPases for 1 hr and bound p110 was detected by western blot for FLAG. The modest RBD sequence similarity among the four paralogs of type I PI3K is shown in Figure 1D. Even though the overall structural organization of the p110β RBD is conserved (Zhang et al., 2011Zhang X. Vadas O. Perisic O. Anderson K.E. Clark J. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Williams R.L.

Cell. 2011; 41: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we speculated that because we cannot detect any interaction with RAS, it might have lost or altered its function. We therefore mutated two highly conserved key residues within the p110β RBD to generate a p110β-S205D/K224A double mutant (p110β-RBD-DM; Figure 1E). Analogous mutations in p110α and p110γ disrupt RAS binding (Gupta et al., 2007Gupta S. Ramjaun A.R. Haiko P. Wang Y. Warne P.H. Nicke B. Nye E. Stamp G. Alitalo K. Downward J.

In vitro, the basal lipid kinase activity of purified recombinant p110β-RBD-DM protein was indistinguishable from its wild-type counterpart prepared in parallel (Figure 1F). Moreover, p110β-RBD-DM was still stimulated by the addition of purified recombinant Gβγ subunits, alone or in combination with a platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-derived phosphotyrosine peptide (pY740), indicating that the RBD mutations had no intrinsic effect on p110β lipid kinase activity or RBD-independent stimulatory input (Figure 1G). However, RBD mutant p110β was much less active than wild-type when expressed in COS7 cells (Figures 1H and S1B) even when Gβγ subunits were coexpressed or a myristoylation signal was added, pointing to a critical role of the RBD for p110β activity in living cells. To identify RBD interactors of p110β, we probed all 34 murine members of the RAS subfamily of small GTPases (RFGs) for binding to p110β/p85 (Figure S1C). Parallel experiments were performed with p110α/p85, p110γ/p101, and p110δ/p85, respectively (Figure S1D). Strikingly, whereas all non-β isoforms interacted with the three prototypical RAS proteins and a partially overlapping subset of closely related RFGs (RRAS1, RRAS2, MRAS, and ERAS), p110β bound to none of those (Figure 2A). Instead, p110β exclusively bound to the more distantly related DIRAS1 and DIRAS2 proteins in a GTP-dependent manner (Figure S1C). DIRAS selectively bound wild-type and not RBD mutant p110β (Figure S2B), suggesting binding to the RBD. However, DIRAS failed to stimulate p110β lipid kinase activity in vitro (Figure 2C) and in cells, where constitutively active DIRAS proteins seemed to repress rather than elevate phospho-AKT when coexpressed along with p110β (Figure 2B), making DIRAS an unlikely in vivo activator of p110β.Figure S2RAC and CDC42 Directly Bind and Active p110β, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) RAS-D33/DIRAS-I37 are essential residues for isoform-specific PI3K binding.

Cells were serum-starved, and protein lysates were made for western blot analysis. When comparing DIRAS with RAS, an obvious difference is the substitution of Asp33 within the G2 box of RAS with Ile37 in DIRAS (Figure 2D). This substitution is relevant to PI3K binding because an HRAS-D33I mutant showed attenuated binding to p110α and DIRAS1-I37D showed reduced binding to p110β, even though exchange of this residue did not enable RAS binding to p110β or DIRAS binding to p110α (Figure S2A), pointing to additional, G2-box-independent determinants of PI3K isoform specificity. Several members of the RHO subfamily of small GTPases harbor a hydrophobic isoleucine or valine residue in this position (Figure S2C), which prompted us to test p110β for binding to representative RHO family GTPases (Figure S2D). Surprisingly, p110β bound to both RAC1 and CDC42 in a GTP-dependent manner. Weaker binding to RHOG and minimal binding to RHOA was also observed (Figure 2E). Importantly, RAC1, CDC42, RHOG, and RHOA preparations bound similar amounts of GTP, indicating proper folding and functionality (Figure 2E, right lower graph), and a RAC1-I33D mutant showed reduced binding to p110β (Figure S2E), confirming a key role of this residue in GTPase binding to p110β. The RAC1/CDC42-p110β interaction was isoform specific because neither RAC1 nor CDC42 significantly bound non-β isoforms under parallel conditions (Figures 2F and S2F). Strikingly, GTPγS-loaded RAC1 or CDC42 strongly stimulated p110β lipid kinase activity in vitro (Figure 2G), alone and in cooperation with a phosphotyrosine peptide (pY740), or when p110β was complexed with a less inhibitory, truncated p85 (Δp85 schematic in Figure 3C). Stimulation of p110β by active RAC1 and CDC42 was dose dependent (Figure 2H). Coexpression of constitutively active RAC1 or CDC42 (Figure S2G, lanes 4–6), but not RHOA (Figure S2H), along with p110β/p85 in COS7 cells strongly elevated cellular phospho-AKT and PIP3 levels (Figure 2I), indicating that both GTPases activate p110β in transfected cells. PIP3 levels were further enhanced by coexpression of Gβ1/Gγ2 subunits or by myristoylation of p110β (Figure 2I). In contrast, GTPγS-loaded RAC1/CDC42 did not stimulate p110α in vitro (Figure S2I), nor did V12-RAC1/CDC42 cooperate with p110α, p110γ, or p110δ to elevate cellular phospho-AKT levels (Figure S2J). Taken together, these data show that the RHO family GTPases RAC1 and CDC42 bind to p110β in an isoform-specific manner and potently and directly stimulate its lipid kinase activity. We next aimed to confirm that RAC and CDC42 are RBD interactors of p110β. Purified recombinant wild-type p110β/p85 bound to RAC1 and CDC42 in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas p110β-RBD-DM/p85 complexes showed no binding (Figure 3A). Similarly, RBD mutant p110β was not stimulated by active RAC1 or CDC42 in vitro (Figure 3B) or in cells (Figure S2E, lanes 7–9). To test whether the BCR homology domain (BHD) on p85, which had previously been shown to bind RAC and CDC42 (Bokoch et al., 1996Bokoch G.M. Vlahos C.J. Wang Y. Knaus U.G. Traynor-Kaplan A.E.

First, methionylated initiator methionine transfer RNA (Met-tRNAi(Met)), eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2, and guanosine triphosphate form a ternary complex (TC). The TC, eIF3, eIF1, and eIF1A cooperatively bind to the 40S subunit, yielding the 43S preinitiation complex, which is ready to attach to messenger RNA (mRNA) and start scanning to the initiation codon. Scanning on structured mRNAs additionally requires DHX29, a DExH-box protein that also binds directly to the 40S subunit. Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the mammalian DHX29-bound 43S complex at 11.6 Å resolution. It reveals that eIF2 interacts with the 40S subunit via its α subunit and supports Met-tRNAi(Met) in an unexpected P/I orientation (eP/I). The structural core of eIF3 resides on the back of the 40S subunit, establishing two principal points of contact, whereas DHX29 binds around helix 16. The structure provides insights into eukaryote-specific aspects of translation, including the mechanism of action of DHX29."

To determine whether synchronous patterns of gene activation are significant in development, we manipulated the timing of snail expression, which controls the coordinated invagination of ∼1,000 mesoderm cells during gastrulation.

We conclude that paused Pol II and transcriptional synchrony are essential for coordinating cell behavior during morphogenesis. The early Drosophila embryo is the premier system for visualizing gene activity in animal development. In a period of just 1 hr, broadly distributed maternal determinants generate localized patterns of gene activity, including segmentation stripes of gene expression (Chen et al., 2012Chen H. Xu Z. Mei C. Yu D. Small S. A system of repressor gradients spatially organizes the boundaries of Bicoid-dependent target genes.Cell. 2012; 149: 618-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A variety of studies suggest that enhancers, typically 300–500 bp in length, are responsible for determining where and when developmental control genes are switched on and off (Ong and Corces, 2011Ong C.T. Corces V.G. Enhancer function: new insights into the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). With few exceptions, localized patterns of expression can be attributed to discrete enhancers located upstream, downstream, or within the gene of interest. The enhancer is therefore seen as the key agent of differential gene activity in animal development (Ong and Corces, 2011Ong C.T. Corces V.G. Enhancer function: new insights into the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Considerably less is known about the role of the promoter in the regulation of the spatial or temporal limits of gene expression, although they are known to control the rates of RNA synthesis (Juven-Gershon and Kadonaga, 2010Juven-Gershon T. Kadonaga J.T. Regulation of gene expression via the core promoter and the basal transcriptional machinery.Dev. Biol. 2010; 339: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In the simplest view, enhancers determine the limits of gene expression (where and when genes are active), whereas the promoter controls the levels of expression (e.g., how many transcripts are produced in a given unit of time). The purpose of this study is to determine whether the promoter regions of developmental control genes can influence the timing or spatial limits of gene expression in the early Drosophila embryo. We were motivated by the recent finding that many developmental control genes contain paused RNA polymerase (Pol II) prior to their activation during embryogenesis (Adelman and Lis, 2012Adelman K. Lis J.T. Promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II: emerging roles in metazoans.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar; Levine, 2011Levine M. Paused RNA polymerase II as a developmental checkpoint.Cell. 2011; 145: 502-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The function of paused Pol II is uncertain, despite its apparent prevalence (∼30% of all protein coding and noncoding genes) in both Drosophila embryos and mammalian stem cells (Guenther and Young, 2012Guenther M.G. Young R.A. Grounded: transcriptional pausing in naive mESCs.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 484-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The prototypic example of paused Pol II, Drosophila heat shock genes, underlies rapid induction of gene expression in response to stress (Boehm et al., 2003Boehm A.K. Saunders A. Werner J. Lis J.T. Transcription factor and polymerase recruitment, modification, and movement on dhsp70 in vivo in the minutes following heat shock.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7628-7637Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that paused Pol II serves to keep promoters “open” by excluding or diminishing the occurrence of positioned nucleosomes that occlude the transcription start site in cultured cells (Gilchrist et al., 2010Gilchrist D.A. Dos Santos G. Fargo D.C. Xie B. Gao Y. Li L. Adelman K. Pausing of RNA polymerase II disrupts DNA-specified nucleosome organization to enable precise gene regulation.Cell. 2010; 143: 540-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Recent quantitative imaging methods suggest that paused Poll II influences synchronous induction of gene expression across the different cells of presumptive tissues in the early Drosophila embryo (Boettiger and Levine, 2009Boettiger A.N. Levine M. Synchronous and stochastic patterns of gene activation in the Drosophila embryo.Science. 2009; 325: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the latter study, quantitative in situ hybridization assays were used to detect the first nascent transcripts encoded by different developmental control genes, within the first 10–20 min after the onset of expression in precellular embryos, ∼2 hr after fertilization. Genes were classified as synchronous if nascent transcripts were detected in over 50% of the nuclei that will eventually express a given gene or stochastic if expressed in fewer than 50%. Most paused genes exhibited synchronous patterns of activation, whereas most nonpaused genes displayed stochastic expression. The evidence linking paused polymerase and synchrony was strictly correlative, and there is no evidence that these modes of activation are significant in development. Here, we employ quantitative imaging (Bothma et al., 2011Bothma J.P. Magliocco J. Levine M. The snail repressor inhibits release, not elongation, of paused Pol II in the Drosophila embryo.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 1571-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar; Perry et al., 2010Perry M.W. Boettiger A.N. Bothma J.P. Levine M. Shadow enhancers foster robustness of Drosophila gastrulation.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 1562-1567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), whole-genome Pol II-binding assays (Zeitlinger et al., 2007Zeitlinger J. Stark A. Kellis M. Hong J.W. Nechaev S. Adelman K. Levine M. Young R.A. RNA polymerase stalling at developmental control genes in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), and BAC transgenesis (Venken et al., 2006Venken K.J. He Y. Hoskins R.A. Bellen H.J. P[acman]: a BAC transgenic platform for targeted insertion of large DNA fragments in D. melanogaster.Science. 2006; 314: 1747-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) to examine the function of paused Pol II in the early Drosophila embryo. Evidence is presented that minimal promoter sequences, ∼100–200 bp centered around the +1 transcription start site, are sufficient for establishing paused Pol II and mediating rapid, synchronous activation of gene expression in transgenic embryos. Those genes containing high levels of paused Pol II achieve coordinate expression more rapidly than those containing low levels. To determine whether the “time to synchrony” is important in development, we manipulated the coordinate expression of snail (sna) (Slug/Sna2 in vertebrates), a major determinant of epithelial-mesenchyme transitions (EMTs) in animal development. In Drosophila, sna is expressed in ∼1,000 cells comprising the presumptive mesoderm (Kosman et al., 1991Kosman D. Ip Y.T. Levine M. Arora K. Establishment of the mesoderm-neuroectoderm boundary in the Drosophila embryo.Science. 1991; 254: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar; Leptin and Grunewald, 1990Leptin M. Grunewald B. Cell shape changes during gastrulation in Drosophila.Development. 1990; 110: 73-84PubMed Google Scholar). These cells undergo coordinated invagination during gastrulation, within 90 min of the onset of sna expression (Leptin, 2005Leptin M. Gastrulation movements: the logic and the nuts and bolts.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 305-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar; Sweeton et al., 1991Sweeton D. Parks S. Costa M. Wieschaus E. Gastrulation in Drosophila: the formation of the ventral furrow and posterior midgut invaginations.Development. 1991; 112: 775-789PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether synchronous activation of sna expression is essential for coordinated invagination of the mesoderm, we replaced the native sna promoter with those from moderately paused (short gastrulation; Chordin) or nonpaused (thisbe; Fgf8) genes. These heterologous promoters result in less synchronous patterns of sna activation and a progressive reduction in mesoderm invagination during gastrulation. We therefore conclude that paused Pol II and transcriptional synchrony are essential for coordinating cell behavior during morphogenesis. Previous studies suggested a correlation between paused Pol II and synchronous patterns of gene activation in the Drosophila embryo. Moreover, computational analyses identified sequence elements that are associated with promoters containing paused Pol II, including GAGA and pause button (PB) motifs (e.g., Gilchrist et al., 2010Gilchrist D.A. Dos Santos G. Fargo D.C. Xie B. Gao Y. Li L. Adelman K.

These observations raise the possibility that the core promoter might be sufficient to determine whether a gene is paused or not paused and activated in a synchronous or stochastic fashion. As a first step toward testing this possibility, we examined the regulation of two Dpp (BMP) target genes, pannier (pnr; GATA4) and tailup (tup; Islet-1), transcription factors essential for the specification of a variety of dorsal tissues, including the heart (Vincent and Buckingham, 2010Vincent S.D. Buckingham M.E. How to make a heart: the origin and regulation of cardiac progenitor cells.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2010; 90: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). These genes are coactivated in the dorsal ectoderm of 2 hr embryos (e.g., Ashe et al., 2000Ashe H.L. Mannervik M. Levine M. Dpp signaling thresholds in the dorsal ectoderm of the Drosophila embryo.Development. 2000; 127: 3305-3312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but, nonetheless, display opposite Pol II-binding profiles. tup is strongly paused, whereas pnr lacks Pol II (Zeitlinger et al., 2007Zeitlinger J. Stark A. Kellis M. Hong J.W. Nechaev S. Adelman K. Levine M. Young R.A. RNA polymerase stalling at developmental control genes in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The use of quantitative imaging methods revealed differences in their activation profiles that were missed in previous studies, as discussed below (Figure 1). tup is activated by high levels of the Dpp gradient, whereas pnr is triggered by low levels (Figures 1A–1H) (Ashe et al., 2000Ashe H.L. Mannervik M. Levine M. Dpp signaling thresholds in the dorsal ectoderm of the Drosophila embryo.Development. 2000; 127: 3305-3312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These distinctive spatial expression patterns depend on previously identified tup and pnr enhancers. Quantitative imaging methods reveal that they also exhibit dissimilar temporal profiles (Figures 1E–1I). It was previously shown that tup contains paused Pol II and is activated in a synchronous fashion, whereas pnr lacks Pol II and exhibits stochastic expression (Boettiger and Levine, 2009Boettiger A.N. Levine M. Synchronous and stochastic patterns of gene activation in the Drosophila embryo.Science. 2009; 325: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We developed high-resolution confocal visualization and image segmentation methods to measure the time to synchrony, i.e., the degree of temporal coordination in gene activation during nuclear cleavage cycle (cc) 14, the 1 hr interval preceding gastrulation (Figures 1A–1H). The ∼6,000 cells comprising the pregastrula embryo are synchronized within the cell cycle, thereby permitting direct comparisons of transcriptional coordination. Quantitative FISH assays permit detection of nascent transcripts shortly after the onset of gene expression (e.g., Bothma et al., 2011Bothma J.P. Magliocco J. Levine M. The snail repressor inhibits release, not elongation, of paused Pol II in the Drosophila embryo.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 1571-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this assay, activation is defined as the time it takes for 50% of the nuclei to express nascent transcripts (t50). Using a cumulative gamma distribution, we fit a curve to each experimental data set (see Figure S1 available online; Supplemental Information). t50 values are calculated by measuring the fraction of nuclei that express a given gene for each fitted activation profile. Pregastrula cc14 embryos are selected based on nuclear density and embryo morphology and then ordered relative to one another based on the fraction of the expression pattern containing nascent transcripts. The collections are designed to ensure that embryos are distributed in an unbiased way across the entirety of cc14. This approach allows us to measure the t50 values with an accuracy of ±5 min (see Table 1; Figure S1; Table S1; Supplemental Information).Table 1Summary of the t50 Values for All of the Constructs Used in This StudyPromotert50 Time (min)Uncertainty from Simulations (min)PnrPr Endo413TupPr Endo263Tup-Y BAC323Tup-Y-PnrPr BAC532PnrE-TupPr NelfE/Spt5394PnrE-TupPrShort313PnrE-TupPr Trl304PnrE-TupPr153PnrE-SnaPr243PnrE-Hsp70Pr284PnrE-SogPr384PnrE-ThsPr552PnrE-PnrPr744SnaE-SnaPr32SnaE-SogPr224SnaE-ThsPr403SnaE-PnrPr423SogE-TupPr10.6SogE-SnaPr10.6SogE-PnrPr357t50 corresponds to the time it takes for an embryo to show nascent transcription in 50% of the pattern. t50 is an estimated time based on the measured activated kinetics of many embryos (see also Figure S1 and Table S1). Open table in a new tab t50 corresponds to the time it takes for an embryo to show nascent transcription in 50% of the pattern. t50 is an estimated time based on the measured activated kinetics of many embryos (see also Figure S1 and Table S1). The endogenous tup and pnr genes exhibit distinct t50 activation profiles: tup achieves t50 expression ∼26 min after the onset of cc14, whereas pnr does not exhibit comparable expression for another 15 min (Table 1). This represents a significant delay because the entire cc14 interphase extends for just 55 min (see below). To determine whether these divergent temporal expression profiles are due to enhancer or promoter sequences, we created a BAC transgene encompassing the entire tup transcription unit and flanking regulatory DNAs that recapitulates the rapid and synchronous activation profile of the endogenous tup locus (Figures 1J and S2). In these experiments, the tup transcription unit was replaced with the yellow reporter gene to facilitate detection of nascent transcripts (Perry et al., 2010Perry M.W. Boettiger A.N. Bothma J.P. Levine M. Shadow enhancers foster robustness of Drosophila gastrulation.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 1562-1567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). There is a slight delay in the t50 value of the BAC transgene (∼32 min) as compared with the endogenous tup locus (∼26 min) (Table 1), which is likely due to the heterologous site of transgene insertion, a slower rate of yellow transcription, or the use of heterozygous embryos to measure expression of BAC transgenes (see Figures 1I and 1J). We next examined the activation profile obtained upon replacement of the paused tup promoter (tupPr) with the nonpaused pnr promoter (Figures 1J and S2). The modified BAC transgene is identical to the control, except for the substitution of just 200 bp centered around the +1 transcription start site of the pnr promoter (Figure S3). The modified transgene was inserted into the same chromosomal location as the control transgene, thereby permitting direct quantitative comparisons of their activation dynamics. Surprisingly, this 200 bp substitution within the large 60 kb BAC transgene is sufficient to convert the rapid and synchronous tup-yellow expression pattern into a slow and stochastic mode of activation (Figure 1J). The modified transgene exhibits a t50 value of 53 min, which is considerably slower than the t50 values seen for the endogenous tup locus (26 min) or unmodified tup BAC transgene (32 min). It is somewhat slower than the t50 value seen for the endogenous pnr locus (41 min), although the differential timing of the tup versus pnr promoters (Δt50) is similar for the endogenous loci and BAC transgenes, at 15 and 21 min, respectively (Table 1). These findings suggest that the pnr promoter, not enhancers, is the prime determinant of its slow and stochastic activation profile during development. The preceding results suggest that minimal promoter sequences might be sufficient to determine whether a gene is activated in a synchronous or stochastic fashion. To establish whether they are also sufficient for determining the presence or absence of paused Pol II, we analyzed minigenes containing the pnr intronic enhancer (pnrE), tupPr, and yellow reporter gene (pnrE > tupPr/yellow). This minigene exhibits synchronous expression in the dorsal ectoderm of wild-type embryos (see below) but is inactive in Toll10b mutants due to the absence of Dpp signaling (Schneider et al., 1991Schneider D.S. Hudson K.L. Lin T.Y. Anderson K.V. Dominant and recessive mutations define functional domains of Toll, a transmembrane protein required for dorsal-ventral polarity in the Drosophila embryo.Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Both the endogenous tup locus and the minigene nonetheless contain paused Pol II in these “silent” Toll10b embryos (Figures 2A and 2B); as expected, the endogenous pnr locus lacks paused Pol II (Zeitlinger et al., 2007Zeitlinger J. Stark A. Kellis M. Hong J.W. Nechaev S. Adelman K. Levine M. Young R.A. RNA polymerase stalling at developmental control genes in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) (Table S2). Permanganate footprint assays identified hypersensitive thymidine residues at positions +48 and +51 nucleotides downstream of the tup transcription start site in transgenic embryos (Figure 2C), strengthening the evidence that the stalled Pol II identified at the tupPr represents promoter-proximal paused Pol II. Thus, the 200 bp tupPr region is sufficient for the establishment of paused Pol II (and synchronous expression, as shown below). It contains key signatures of paused promoters (Gilchrist et al., 2010Gilchrist D.A. Dos Santos G. Fargo D.C. Xie B. Gao Y. Li L. Adelman K.

HSF access to heat shock elements in vivo depends critically on promoter architecture defined by GAGA factor, TFIID, and RNA polymerase II binding sites.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2756-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), including 5′ GAGA elements located ∼100 bp upstream of the transcription start site, and PB motifs positioned +54 to +64 bp downstream of the start site, in the vicinity of the hypersensitive thymidine residues identified by permanganate protection assays (Figures 2C and S3). We therefore conclude that minimal promoter sequences are sufficient to establish paused Pol II in vivo, in the Drosophila embryo. In principle, any gene can be artificially “paused” or “depaused” by exchanging minimal promoter sequences. Such an approach may be relevant to the stem cell field because some of the key determinants of pluripotency (e.g., Nanog) exhibit stochastic expression among the different ICM cells of mouse embryos (Kalmar et al., 2009Kalmar T. Lim C. Hayward P. Muñoz-Descalzo S. Nichols J. Garcia-Ojalvo J. Martinez Arias A. Regulated fluctuations in nanog expression mediate cell fate decisions in embryonic stem cells.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000149Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar; Nichols and Smith, 2011Nichols J. Smith A. The origin and identity of embryonic stem cells.Development. 2011; 138: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To establish a sharper connection between “pausing elements” in the tupPr and transcriptional synchrony, we expressed the pnrE > tupPr/yellow transgene in embryos containing diminished levels of the GAGA-binding protein, GAF (or Trl). Previous studies implicated GAGA and Trl in the stable association of paused Pol II within the proximal promoter of Hsp70 (Fay et al., 2011Fay A. Misulovin Z. Li J. Schaaf C.A. Gause M. Gilmour D.S. Dorsett D. Cohesin selectively binds and regulates genes with paused RNA polymerase.Curr.

Hirayoshi K. Fernandes M. Lis J.T. HSF access to heat shock elements in vivo depends critically on promoter architecture defined by GAGA factor, TFIID, and RNA polymerase II binding sites.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2756-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The tupPr region contains GAGA elements located ∼100 bp upstream of the transcription start site (Figure S3), and whole-genome assays confirm GAF/Trl binding to this region in the Drosophila embryo (Schuettengruber et al., 2009Schuettengruber B. Ganapathi M. Leblanc B. Portoso M. Jaschek R. Tolhuis B. van Lohuizen M. Tanay A. Cavalli G. Functional anatomy of polycomb and trithorax chromatin landscapes in Drosophila embryos.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e13Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Reduced levels of Trl caused an ∼20 min delay in the activation of the pnrE > tupPr/yellow transgene, as compared with wild-type embryos (Figure 2D; Table 1), similar to the activation profile mediated by the nonpaused thisbe promoter (see below). An equivalent delay is observed with a truncated tupPr lacking upstream GAGA elements but retaining all core elements such as the INR (Figure 2D; Table 1). These studies suggest a close correlation between Trl/GAGA and the temporal coordination of gene activation. The stability of paused Pol II also depends on negative elongation factors, such as NELF and Spt5, which bind nascent transcripts shortly after the onset of transcription (Gilchrist et al., 2010Gilchrist D.A. Dos Santos G. Fargo D.C. Xie B. Gao Y. Li L. Adelman K.

Gilmour D.S. Promoter proximal pausing and the control of gene expression.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2011; 21: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). There is an ∼30 min delay in the activation profile of the pnrE > tupPr/yellow transgene in embryos containing reduced levels of NelfE and Spt5 (Figure 2D; Table 1). Thus, the preceding findings suggest a close correlation among minimal promoter sequences, paused Pol II, and the time to synchrony in the Drosophila embryo. Whole-genome Pol II chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) assays suggest that genes might not be simply paused or nonpaused, and activated in a strictly synchronous or stochastic fashion. Instead, there are different levels of Pol II in the promoter regions of genes previously identified as stalled or not stalled (Figure 3F; see Zeitlinger et al., 2007Zeitlinger J. Stark A. Kellis M. Hong J.W. Nechaev S. Adelman K. Levine M. Young R.A. RNA polymerase stalling at developmental control genes in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Normalized levels of paused Pol II were measured in vivo in dorsal-ventral patterning mutants containing a single embryonic tissue, in which the gene in question is silent (Figure 3F). For example, tup is not expressed in Toll10b mutant embryos because they contain only mesoderm due to the transformation of ectoderm into mesoderm. Conversely, sna is not expressed in gd7 mutant embryos, which display the reciprocal transformation of mesoderm into ectoderm. The tup and sna promoters contain significantly more Pol II sequence reads than sog in silent mutant embryos, even though all three genes were classified as stalled or paused in previous studies (Zeitlinger et al., 2007Zeitlinger J. Stark A. Kellis M. Hong J.W. Nechaev S. Adelman K. Levine M. Young R.A. RNA polymerase stalling at developmental control genes in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Similarly, thisbe contains more Pol II than pnr, even though both genes were classified as nonstalled. tup is consistently seen to contain the highest levels of promoter-proximal Pol II read counts in a variety of tissues (Gaertner et al., 2012Gaertner B. Johnston J. Chen K. Wallaschek N. Paulson A. Garruss A.S. Gaudenz K. De Kumar B. Krumlauf R. Zeitlinger J. Poised RNA polymerase II changes over developmental time and prepares genes for future expression.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 1670-1683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To investigate the significance of these different levels of Pol II, we analyzed the expression of a series of minigenes containing the pnr enhancer (pnrE) and six different promoter sequences encompassing a spectrum of paused Pol II (Figure S3). Remarkably, the activation profiles of these minigenes mirror the levels of Pol II binding (Figure 3E; Table 1). The tupPr contains the highest levels of Pol II and exhibits a t50 value of just ∼15 min. This is followed by progressively slower profiles for sna (t50, 24 min), hsp70 (28 min), and sog (38 min), which contain successively lower levels of Pol II. Finally, the promoter regions of the nonpaused ge"

However, the mechanisms driving transcriptome amplification during the immune response are unknown. By monitoring single-stranded DNA genome wide, we show that the genome of naive cells is poised for rapid activation. In G0, ∼90% of promoters from genes to be expressed in cycling lymphocytes are polymerase loaded but unmelted and support only basal transcription. Furthermore, the transition from abortive to productive elongation is kinetically limiting, causing polymerases to accumulate nearer to transcription start sites. Resting lymphocytes also limit the expression of the transcription factor IIH complex, including XPB and XPD helicases involved in promoter melting and open complex extension. To date, two rate-limiting steps have been shown to control global gene expression in eukaryotes: preinitiation complex assembly and polymerase pausing. Our studies identify promoter melting as a third key regulatory step and propose that this mechanism ensures a prompt lymphocyte response to invading pathogens."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease whose causes are still poorly understood. To identify additional genetic risk factors, we assessed the role of de novo mutations in ALS by sequencing the exomes of 47 ALS patients and both of their unaffected parents (n = 141 exomes). We found that amino acid–altering de novo mutations were enriched in genes encoding chromatin regulators, including the neuronal chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF) component SS18L1 (also known as CREST). CREST mutations inhibited activity-dependent neurite outgrowth in primary neurons, and CREST associated with the ALS protein FUS. These findings expand our understanding of the ALS genetic landscape and provide a resource for future studies into the pathogenic mechanisms contributing to sporadic ALS."

The synthesis of a stable phosphohistidine mimic now leads to a pan antibody, enabling detection and further functional investigations of this little-known post-translational modification.

We report the development of the first pan-phosphohistidine (pHis) antibody using a stable pHis mimetic as the hapten. This antibody was successfully used in ELISA, western blotting, dot blot assays and immunoprecipitation and in detection and identification of histidine-phosphorylated proteins from native cell lysates when coupled with MS analysis. We also observed that the amount of protein pHis in Escherichia coli lysates depends on carbon source and nitrogen availability in the growth medium. In particular, we found that the amount of pHis on phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PpsA) is sensitive to nitrogen availability in vivo and that α-ketoglutarate inhibits phosphotransfer from phosphorylated PpsA to pyruvate. We expect this antibody to open opportunities for investigating other pHis proteins and their functions."

Therefore, a continuing challenge is identifying a drug that is hypersensitive to cancer cells but has minimal deleterious effects on healthy cells. The aims of this study were to evaluate the potential of 4β-hydroxywithanolide (4βHWE) for selectively killing cancer cells and to elucidate its related mechanisms.Changes in survival, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and apoptosis signaling were compared between 4βHWE-treated oral cancer (Ca9-22) and normal fibroblast (HGF-1) cells. At 24 h and 48 h, the numbers of Ca9-22 cells were substantially decreased, but the numbers of HGF-1 cells were only slightly decreased. Additionally, the IC50 values for 4βHWE in the Ca9-22 cells were 3.6 and 1.9 µg/ml at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Time-dependent abnormal increases in ROS and dose-responsive mitochondrial depolarization can be exploited by using 4βHWE in chemotherapies for selectively killing cancer cells. Dose-dependent DNA damage measured by comet-nuclear extract assay and flow cytometry-based γ-H2AX/propidium iodide (PI) analysis showed relatively severer damage in the Ca9-22 cells. At both low and high concentrations, 4βHWE preferably perturbed the cell cycle in Ca9-22 cells by increasing the subG1 population and arrest of G1 or G2/M. Selective induction of apoptosis in Ca9-22 cells was further confirmed by Annexin V/PI assay, by preferential expression of phosphorylated ataxia-telangiectasia- and Rad3-related protein (p-ATR), and by cleavage of caspase 9, caspase 3, and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP).Together, the findings of this study, particularly the improved understanding of the selective killing mechanisms of 4βHWE, can be used to improve efficiency in killing oral cancer cells during chemoprevention and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2002520997,"Recent analyses have shown that significant changes have occurred in patterns of sea ice seasonality in West Antarctica since 1979, with wide-ranging climatic, biological and biogeochemical consequences. Here, we provide the first detailed report on long-term change and variability in annual timings of sea ice advance, retreat and resultant ice season duration in East Antarctica. These were calculated from satellite-derived ice concentration data for the period 1979/80 to 2009/10. The pattern of change in sea ice seasonality off East Antarctica comprises mixed signals on regional to local scales, with pockets of strongly positive and negative trends occurring in near juxtaposition in certain regions e.g., Prydz Bay. This pattern strongly reflects change and variability in different elements of the marine “icescape”, including fast ice, polynyas and the marginal ice zone. A trend towards shorter sea-ice duration (of 1 to 3 days per annum) occurs in fairly isolated pockets in the outer pack from∼95–110°E, and in various near-coastal areas that include an area of particularly strong and persistent change near Australia's Davis Station and between the Amery and West Ice Shelves. These areas are largely associated with coastal polynyas that are important as sites of enhanced sea ice production/melt. Areas of positive trend in ice season duration are more extensive, and include an extensive zone from 160–170°E (i.e., the western Ross Sea sector) and the near-coastal zone between 40–100°E. The East Antarctic pattern is considerably more complex than the well-documented trends in West Antarctica e.g., in the Antarctic Peninsula-Bellingshausen Sea and western Ross Sea sectors."
https://openalex.org/W1978934797,"Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variants (SCVs) are persistent pathogenic bacteria characterized by slow growth and, for many of these strains, an increased ability to form biofilms and to persist within host cells. The virulence-associated gene expression profile of SCVs clearly differs from that of prototypical strains and is often influenced by SigB rather than by the agr system. One objective of this work was to confirm the role of SigB in the control of the expression of virulence factors involved in biofilm formation and intracellular persistence of SCVs. This study shows that extracellular proteins are involved in the formation of biofilm by three SCV strains, which, additionally, have a low biofilm-dispersing activity. It was determined that SigB activity modulates biofilm formation by strain SCV CF07-S and is dominant over that of the agr system without being solely responsible for the repression of proteolytic activity. On the other hand, the expression of fnbA and the control of nuclease activity contributed to the SigB-dependent formation of biofilm of this SCV strain. SigB was also required for the replication of CF07-S within epithelial cells and may be involved in the colonization of lungs by SCVs in a mouse infection model. This study methodically investigated SigB activity and associated mechanisms in the various aspects of SCV pathogenesis. Results confirm that SigB activity importantly influences the production of virulence factors, biofilm formation and intracellular persistence for some clinical SCV strains."
https://openalex.org/W2041270797,"Many sea level rise adaptation plans emphasize the protection of adjacent uplands to allow for inland salt marsh migration, but little empirical information exists on this process. Using aerial photos from 1930 and 2006 of Delaware Estuary coastal habitats in New Jersey, I documented the rate of coastal forest retreat and the rate of inland salt marsh migration across 101.1 km of undeveloped salt marsh and forest ecotone. Over this time, the amount of forest edge at this ecotone nearly doubled. In addition, the average amount of forest retreat was 141.2 m while the amount of salt marsh inland migration was 41.9 m. Variation in forest retreat within the study area was influenced by variation in slope. The lag between the amount of forest retreat and salt marsh migration is accounted for by the presence of Phragmites australis which occupies the forest and salt marsh ecotone. Phragmites expands from this edge into forest dieback areas, and the ability of salt marsh to move inland and displace Phragmites is likely influenced by salinity at both an estuary-wide scale and at the scale of local subwatersheds. Inland movement of salt marsh is lowest at lower salinity areas further away from the mouth of the estuary and closer to local heads of tide. These results allow for better prediction of salt marsh migration in estuarine landscapes and provide guidance for adaptation planners seeking to prioritize those places with the highest likelihood of inland salt marsh migration in the near-term."
https://openalex.org/W2114517583,"The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is the crucial ubiquitin ligase targeting the regulatory machinery of the cell cycle. Emi1, a major modulator of APC activity, is thought to act competitively as a pseudosubstrate. We show that the modulation of APC activity is more subtle: Emi1 inhibits ubiquitylation at both substrate binding and separately at the step of ubiquitin transfer to APC-bound substrates. The zinc-binding region of Emi1 allows multiple monoubiquitylation of substrates, but preferentially suppresses the ubiquitin chain elongation by UBCH10. Furthermore, the carboxy-terminal tail of Emi1 antagonizes chain elongation by Ube2S, by competitively preventing its binding to the APC cullin subunit through electrostatic interaction. Combinatorially, Emi1 effectively stabilizes APC substrates by suppressing ubiquitin chain extension. Deubiquitylating enzymes can then convert inhibited substrates to their basal state. Chain elongation may be a particularly sensitive step for controlling degradation, and this study provides the first kinetic evidence for how it is inhibited. The Emi1 protein inhibits the anaphase promoting complex (APC), an E3 ubiquitin ligase and critical cell cycle regulator, but it has remained unclear how it does this. Wang and Kirschner demonstrate that Emi1 suppresses the elongation of ubiquitin chains on APC substrates by interfering in different ways with the activities of the E2 enzymes UBCH10 and Ube2S."

Communication between climbing fibers (CFs) and molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) in the cerebellum is mediated exclusively by glutamate spillover. Here, we show how CF stimulation functionally segregates MLIs based on their location relative to glutamate release. Excitation of MLIs that reside within the domain of spillover diffusion coordinates inhibition of MLIs outside the diffusion limit. CF excitation of MLIs is dependent on extrasynaptic NMDA receptors that enhance the spatial and temporal spread of CF signaling. Activity mediated by functionally segregated MLIs converges onto neighboring Purkinje cells (PCs) to generate a long-lasting biphasic change in inhibition. These data demonstrate how glutamate release from single CFs modulates excitability of neighboring PCs, thus expanding the influence of CFs on cerebellar cortical activity in a manner not predicted by anatomical connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2012039267,"Hereditary hemochromatosis, an iron overload disease associated with excessive intestinal iron absorption, is commonly caused by loss of HFE gene function. Both iron and manganese absorption are regulated by iron status, but the relationships between the transport pathways of these metals and how they are affected by HFE-associated hemochromatosis remain poorly understood. Loss of HFE function is known to alter the intestinal expression of DMT1 (divalent metal transporter-1) and Fpn (ferroportin), transporters that have been implicated in absorption of both iron and manganese. Although the influence of HFE deficiency on dietary iron absorption has been characterized, potential effects on manganese metabolism have yet to be explored. To investigate the role of HFE in manganese absorption, we characterized the uptake and distribution of the metal in Hfe−/− knockout mice after intravenous, intragastric, and intranasal administration of 54Mn. These values were compared to intravenous and intragastric administration of 59Fe. Intestinal absorption of 59Fe was increased and clearance of injected 59Fe was also increased in Hfe−/− mice compared to controls. Hfe−/− mice displayed greater intestinal absorption of 54Mn compared to wild-type Hfe+/+ control mice. After intravenous injection, the distribution of 59Fe to heart and liver was greater in Hfe−/− mice but no remarkable differences were observed for 54Mn. Although olfactory absorption of 54Mn into blood was unchanged in Hfe−/− mice, higher levels of intranasally-instilled 54Mn were associated with Hfe−/− brain compared to controls. These results show that manganese transport and metabolism can be modified by HFE deficiency."

Besides, we also identified the differentially methylated genes between patients with PCOS-non-insulin resistance (PCOS-NIR) and PCOS-insulin resistance (PCOS-IR). A total of 79 genes were differentially methylated between PCOS-NIR vs. PCOS-IR patients, and 40 genes were differentially methylated in PCOS patients vs. healthy controls. We analyzed these differentially methylated genes by constructing regulatory networks and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Further, Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis were also performed to investigate the biological functions of networks. We identified multiple categories of genes that were differentially methylated between PCOS-NIR and PCOS-IR patients, or between PCOS patients and healthy controls. Significantly, GO categories of immune response were differentially methylated in PCOS-IR vs. PCOS-NIR. Further, genes in cancer pathways were also differentially methylated in PCOS-NIR vs. PCOS-IR patients or in PCOS patients vs. healthy controls. The results of this current study will help to further understand the mechanism of PCOS."
https://openalex.org/W2101000006,"The emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae has led to difficulties in treating patients, and novel strategies to prevent and treat this infection are urgently needed. Here, we examined 21 different nanomaterials for their potential activity against N. gonorrhoeae (ATCC 49226). Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs, 120 nm) showed the greatest potency for reducing N. gonorrhoeae colony formation (MIC: 12.5 µg/ml) and possessed the dominant influence on the antibacterial activity with their properties of the nanoparticles within a concentration range that did not induce cytotoxicity in human fibroblasts or epithelial cells. Electron microscopy revealed that the Ag NPs significantly reduced bacterial cell membrane integrity. Furthermore, the use of clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae showed that combined treatment with 120 nm Ag NPs and cefmetazole produced additive effects. This is the first report to screen the effectiveness of nanomaterials against N. gonorrhoeae, and our results indicate that 120 nm Ag NPs deliver low levels of toxicity to human epithelial cells and could be used as an adjuvant with antibiotic therapy, either for topical use or as a coating for biomaterials, to prevent or treat multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae."
https://openalex.org/W2024597019,"The rate of cell-cycle progression must be tuned in response to nutrient levels to ensure that sufficient materials are synthesized to generate viable daughters. We report that accumulation of the yeast M phase B-cyclin CLB2 mRNA depends on assembly and activation of the heterogeneous nuclear RNA-binding protein (hnRNP) arginine methyltransferase Hmt1, which is promoted by the kinase Dbf2 and countered by the PP2A phosphatase Pph22. Activated Hmt1 methylates hnRNPs, which in turn stabilize CLB2 transcripts. Dbf2 activation of Hmt1 is highly cooperative, producing a sharp increase in CLB2, whereas Pph22 dephosphorylation is graded such that small changes in PP2A activity can cause large shifts in Dbf2-mediated Hmt1 activity. Starvation and rapamycin inhibition of TOR activate Pph22, causing a depletion of CLB2 and delay of M phase. We propose a general model wherein changes to Pph22 activity modulate cyclin mRNA stability to tune cell-cycle progression to environmental conditions."

The procedures adopted to prepare this tissue consist in treatment with aldehydes, which do not prevent post-graft tissue calcification due to incomplete xeno-antigens removal. The adoption of fixative-free decellularization protocols has been therefore suggested to overcome this limitation. Although promising, the decellularized pericardium has not yet used in clinics, due to the absence of proofs indicating that the decellularization and cryopreservation procedures can effectively preserve the mechanical properties and the immunologic compatibility of the tissue.The aim of the present work was to validate a procedure to prepare decellularized/cryopreserved human pericardium which may be implemented into cardiovascular homograft tissue Banks. The method employed to decellularize the tissue completely removed the cells without affecting ECM structure; furthermore, uniaxial tensile loading tests revealed an equivalent resistance of the decellularized tissue to strain, before and after the cryopreservation, in comparison with the fresh tissue. Finally, immunological compatibility, showed a minimized host immune cells invasion and low levels of systemic inflammation, as assessed by tissue transplantation into immune-competent mice.Our results indicate, for the first time, that fixative-free decellularized pericardium from cadaveric tissue donors can be banked according to Tissue Repository-approved procedures without compromising its mechanical properties and immunological tolerance. This tissue can be therefore treated as a safe homograft for cardiac surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2059329334,"Mutations in the coding sequence of the X-linked gene MeCP2 (Methyl CpG–binding protein) are present in around 80% of patients with Rett Syndrome, a common cause of intellectual disability in female and to date without any effective pharmacological treatment. A relevant, and so far unexplored feature of RTT patients, is a marked reduction in peripheral circulation. To investigate the relationship between loss of MeCP2 and this clinical aspect, we used the MeCP2 null mouse model B6.129SF1-MeCP2tm1Jae for functional and pharmacological studies. Functional experiments were performed on isolated resistance mesenteric vessels, mounted on a pressurized myograph. Vessels from female MeCP2+/− mice show a reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation, due to a reduced Nitric Oxide (NO) availability secondary to an increased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation. Such functional aspects are associated with an intravascular increase in superoxide anion production, and a decreased vascular eNOS expression. These alterations are reversed by curcumin administration (5% (w/w) dietary curcumin for 21 days), which restores endothelial NO availability, decreases intravascular ROS production and normalizes vascular eNOS gene expression. In conclusion our findings highlight alterations in the vascular/endothelial system in the absence of a correct function of MeCP2, and uncover related cellular/molecular mechanisms that are rescued by an anti-oxidant treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2031750327,"Vascular smooth muscle cells are constantly exposed to mechanical force by the blood pressure, which is thought to regulate smooth muscle growth, differentiation and contractile function. We have previously shown that the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs, is essential for regulation of smooth muscle phenotype including stretch-dependent contractile differentiation. In this study, we have investigated the effect of mechanical stretch on miRNA expression and the role of stretch-sensitive miRNAs for intracellular signaling in smooth muscle. MiRNA array analysis, comparing miRNA levels in stretched versus non-stretched portal veins, revealed a dramatic decrease in the miR-144/451 cluster level. Because this miRNA cluster is predicted to target AMPK pathway components, we next examined activation of this pathway. Diminished miR-144/451 expression was inversely correlated with increased phosphorylation of AMPKα at Thr172 in stretched portal vein. Similar to the effect of stretch, contractile differentiation could be induced in non-stretched portal veins by the AMPK activator, AICAR. Transfection with miR-144/451 mimics reduced the protein expression level of mediators in the AMPK pathway including MO25α, AMPK and ACC. This effect also decreased AICAR-induced activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. In conclusion, our results suggest that stretch-induced activation of AMPK in vascular smooth muscle is in part regulated by reduced levels of miR-144/451 and that this effect may play a role in promoting contractile differentiation of smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2055796568,"Epigenetics, or the reversible and heritable marks of gene regulation not including DNA sequence, encompasses chromatin modifications on both the DNA and histones and is as important as the DNA sequence itself. Chromatin-modifying factors are playing an increasingly important role in tumorigenesis, particularly among pediatric rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS), revealing potential novel therapeutic targets. We performed an overexpression screen of chromatin-modifying factors in a KRASG12D-driven zebrafish model for RMS. Here, we describe the identification of a histone H3 lysine 9 histone methyltransferase, SUV39H1, as a suppressor of embryonal RMS formation in zebrafish. This suppression is specific to the histone methyltransferase activity of SUV39H1, as point mutations in the SET domain lacked the effect. SUV39H1-overexpressing and control tumors have a similar proliferation rate, muscle differentiation state, and tumor growth rate. Strikingly, SUV39H1-overexpressing fish initiate fewer tumors, which results in the observed suppressive phenotype. We demonstrate that the delayed tumor onset occurs between 5 and 7 days post fertilization. Gene expression profiling at these stages revealed that in the context of KRASG12D overexpression, SUV39H1 may suppress cell cycle progression. Our studies provide evidence for the role of SUV39H1 as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W1995014678,"Anserine (beta-alanyl-N(Pi)-methyl-L-histidine), a naturally occurring derivative of carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine), is an abundant constituent of skeletal muscles and brain of many vertebrates. Although it has long been proposed to serve as a proton buffer, radicals scavenger and transglycating agent, its physiological function remains obscure. The formation of anserine is catalyzed by carnosine N-methyltransferase which exhibits unknown molecular identity. In the present investigation, we have purified carnosine N-methyltransferase from chicken pectoral muscle about 640-fold until three major polypeptides of about 23, 26 and 37 kDa coeluting with the enzyme were identified in the preparation. Mass spectrometry analysis of these polypeptides resulted in an identification of histamine N-methyltransferase-like (HNMT-like) protein as the only meaningful candidate. Analysis of GenBank database records indicated that the hnmt-like gene might be a paralogue of histamine N-methyltransferase gene, while comparison of their protein sequences suggested that HNMT-like protein might have acquired a new activity. Chicken HNMT-like protein was expressed in COS-7 cells, purified to homogeneity, and shown to catalyze the formation of anserine as confirmed by both chromatographic and mass spectrometry analysis. Both specificity and kinetic studies carried out on the native and recombinant enzyme were in agreement with published data. Particularly, several compounds structurally related to carnosine, including histamine and L-histidine, were tested as potential substrates for the enzyme, and carnosine was the only methyl group acceptor. The identification of the gene encoding carnosine N-methyltransferase might be beneficial for estimation of the biological functions of anserine."
https://openalex.org/W2141913030,"Biological fluids fulfill key functionalities such as hydrating, protecting, and nourishing cells and tissues in various organ systems. They are capable of these versatile tasks owing to their distinct structural and viscoelastic properties. Characterizing the viscoelastic properties of bio-fluids is of pivotal importance for monitoring the development of certain pathologies as well as engineering synthetic replacements. Laser Speckle Rheology (LSR) is a novel optical technology that enables mechanical evaluation of tissue. In LSR, a coherent laser beam illuminates the tissue and temporal speckle intensity fluctuations are analyzed to evaluate mechanical properties. The rate of temporal speckle fluctuations is, however, influenced by both optical and mechanical properties of tissue. Therefore, in this paper, we develop and validate an approach to estimate and compensate for the contributions of light scattering to speckle dynamics and demonstrate the capability of LSR for the accurate extraction of viscoelastic moduli in phantom samples and biological fluids of varying optical and mechanical properties."
https://openalex.org/W1972587570,"Type 2 diabetes is characterized by both insulin resistance and progressive deterioration of β-cell function. The forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 is a prominent mediator of insulin signaling in β-cells. We reasoned that identification of FoxO1 target genes in β-cells could reveal mechanisms linking β-cell dysfunction to insulin resistance. In this study, we report the characterization of Nov/Ccn3 as a novel transcriptional target of FoxO1 in pancreatic β-cells. FoxO1 binds to an evolutionarily conserved response element in the Ccn3 promoter to regulate its expression. Accordingly, CCN3 levels are elevated in pancreatic islets of mice with overexpression of a constitutively active form of FoxO1 or insulin resistance. Our functional studies reveal that CCN3 impairs β-cell proliferation concomitantly with a reduction in cAMP levels. Moreover, CCN3 decreases glucose oxidation, which translates into inhibition of glucose-stimulated Ca2+ entry and insulin secretion. Our results identify CCN3, a novel transcriptional target of FoxO1 in pancreatic β-cells, as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2128497706,"Intraneuronal inclusions containing alpha-synuclein (a-syn) constitute one of the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD) and are accompanied by severe neurodegeneration of A9 dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra. Although to a lesser extent, A10 dopaminergic neurons are also affected. Neurodegeneration of other neuronal populations, such as the cholinergic, serotonergic and noradrenergic cell groups, has also been documented in PD patients. Studies in human post-mortem PD brains and in rodent models suggest that deficits in cholinergic and dopaminergic systems may be associated with the cognitive impairment seen in this disease. Here, we investigated the consequences of targeted overexpression of a-syn in the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic and septohippocampal cholinergic pathways. Rats were injected with recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors encoding for either human wild-type a-syn or green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the ventral tegmental area and the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca, two regions rich in dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons, respectively. Histopathological analysis showed widespread insoluble a-syn positive inclusions in all major projections areas of the targeted nuclei, including the hippocampus, neocortex, nucleus accumbens and anteromedial striatum. In addition, the rats overexpressing human a-syn displayed an abnormal locomotor response to apomorphine injection and exhibited spatial learning and memory deficits in the Morris water maze task, in the absence of obvious spontaneous locomotor impairment. As losses in dopaminergic and cholinergic immunoreactivity in both the GFP and a-syn expressing animals were mild-to-moderate and did not differ from each other, the behavioral impairments seen in the a-syn overexpressing animals appear to be determined by the long term persisting neuropathology in the surviving neurons rather than by neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1966316195,"Cooperation is necessary in many types of human joint activity and relations. Evidence suggests that cooperation has direct and indirect benefits for the cooperators. Given how beneficial cooperation is overall, it seems relevant to investigate the various ways of enhancing individuals' willingness to invest in cooperative endeavors. We studied whether ascription of a transparent collective goal in a joint action promotes cooperation in a group.A total of 48 participants were assigned in teams of 4 individuals to either a ""transparent goal-ascription"" or an ""opaque goal-ascription"" condition. After the manipulation, the participants played an anonymous public goods game with another member of their team. We measured the willingness of participants to cooperate and their expectations about the other player's contribution.Between subjects analyses showed that transparent goal ascription impacts participants' likelihood to cooperate with each other in the future, thereby greatly increasing the benefits from social interactions. Further analysis showed that this could be explained with a change in expectations about the partner's behavior and by an emotional alignment of the participants.The study found that a transparent goal ascription is associated with an increase of cooperation. We propose several high-level mechanisms that could explain the observed effect: general affect modulation, trust, expectation and perception of collective efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2088070897,"Cholesterol loaded macrophages in the arterial intima are the earliest histological evidence of atherosclerosis. Studies of mouse models of atherosclerosis have shown that the strain background can have a significant effect on lesion development. We have previously shown that DBA/2 ApoE−/− mice have aortic root lesions 10-fold larger than AKR ApoE−/−mice. The current study analyzes the response to cholesterol loading of macrophages from these two strains. Macrophages from the atherosclerosis susceptible DBA/2 strain had significantly higher levels of total and esterified cholesterol compared to atherosclerosis resistant AKR macrophages, while free cholesterol levels were higher in AKR cells. Gene expression profiles were obtained and data were analyzed for strain, cholesterol loading, and strain-cholesterol loading interaction effects by a fitted linear model. Pathway and transcriptional motif enrichment were identified by gene set enrichment analysis. In addition to observed strain differences in basal gene expression, we identified many transcripts whose expression was significantly altered in response to cholesterol loading, including P2ry13 and P2ry14, Trib3, Hyal1, Vegfa, Ccr5, Ly6a, and Ifit3. Eight pathways were significantly enriched in transcripts regulated by cholesterol loading, among which the lysosome and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways had the highest number of significantly regulated transcripts. Of the differentially regulated transcripts with a strain-cholesterol loading interaction effect, we identified three genes known to participate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, Ddit3, Trib3 and Atf4. These three transcripts were highly up-regulated by cholesterol in AKR and either down-regulated or unchanged in loaded DBA/2 macrophages, thus associating a robust ER stress response with atherosclerosis resistance. We identified significant transcripts with strain, loading, or strain-loading interaction effect that reside within previously described quantitative trait loci as atherosclerosis modifier candidate genes. In conclusion, we characterized several strain and cholesterol induced differences that may lead to new insights into cellular cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1970116958,"We investigated intraguild interactions between two egg parasitoids of Nezara viridula (L.) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae), Ooencyrtus telenomicida (Vassiliev) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) and Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae), as the former has the potential to be a facultative hyperparasitoid of the latter. We assessed the suitability of N. viridula eggs for the development of O. telenomicida as a function of egg age when they were unparasitized, or had been attacked by T. basalis at different times prior to exposure to O. telenomicida females. Ooencyrtus telenomicida can exploit healthy N. viridula host eggs up to 5 days of age, just prior to the emergence of N. viridula. This window of opportunity can be extended for an additional 6–7 days through interspecific competition or facultative hyperparasitism. While there are minor fitness costs for O. telenomicida as the result of interspecific larval competition, those costs are greater with facultative hyperparasitism. In choice assays O. telenomicida females discriminated between different quality N. viridula eggs, avoiding those where their progeny would have to develop as facultative hyperparasitoids of T. basalis. Results are discussed with respect to the possible effects that the costs of intraguild parasitism might have on biological control programmes."
https://openalex.org/W1995428293,"Sterigmatocystin (ST), which is commonly detected in food and feed commodities, is a mutagenic and carcinogenic mycotoxin that has been recognized as a possible human carcinogen. Our previous study showed that ST can induce G2 phase arrest in GES-1 cells in vitro and that the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways are involved in the ST-induced G2 arrest. It is now widely accepted that DNA damage plays a critical role in the regulation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In response to DNA damage, a complex signaling network is activated in eukaryotic cells to trigger cell cycle arrest and facilitate DNA repair. To further explore the molecular mechanism through which ST induces G2 arrest, the current study was designed to precisely dissect the role of DNA damage and the DNA damage sensor ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)/p53-dependent pathway in the ST-induced G2 arrest in GES-1 cells. Using the comet assay, we determined that ST induces DNA damage, as evidenced by the formation of DNA comet tails, in GES-1 cells. We also found that ST induces the activation of ATM and its downstream molecules, Chk2 and p53, in GES-1 cells. The ATM pharmacological inhibitor caffeine was found to effectively inhibit the activation of the ATM-dependent pathways and to rescue the ST-induced G2 arrest in GES-1 cells, which indicating its ATM-dependent characteristic. Moreover, the silencing of the p53 expression with siRNA effectively attenuated the ST-induced G2 arrest in GES-1 cells. We also found that ST induces apoptosis in GES-1 cells. Thus, our results show that the ST-induced DNA damage activates the ATM/53-dependent signaling pathway, which contributes to the induction of G2 arrest in GES-1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2015593596,"Foraging animals typically encounter opportunities that they either pursue or skip, but occasionally meet several alternatives simultaneously. Behavioural ecologists predict preferences using absolute properties of each option, while decision theorists focus on relative evaluations at the time of choice. We use European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to integrate ecological reasoning with decision models, linking and testing hypotheses for value acquisition and choice mechanism. We hypothesise that options' values depend jointly on absolute attributes, learning context, and subject's state. In simultaneous choices, preference could result either from comparing subjective values using deliberation time, or from processing each alternative independently, without relative comparisons. The combination of the value acquisition hypothesis and independent processing at choice time has been called the Sequential Choice Model. We test this model with options equated in absolute properties to exclude the possibility of preference being built at the time of choice. Starlings learned to obtain food by responding to four stimuli in two contexts. In context [AB], they encountered options A5 or B10 in random alternation; in context [CD], they met C10 or D20. Delay to food is denoted, in seconds, by the suffixes. Observed latency to respond (Li) to each option alone (our measure of value) ranked thus: LA≈LC<LB<<LD, consistently with value being sensitive to both delay and learning context. We then introduced simultaneous presentations of A5 vs. C10 and B10 vs. C10, using latencies in no-choice tests to predict sign and strength of preference in pairings. Starlings preferred A5 over C10 and C10 over B10. There was no detectable evaluation time, and preference magnitude was predictable from latency differentials. This implies that value reflects learning rather than choice context, that preferences are not constructed by relative judgements at the time of choice, and that mechanisms adapted for sequential decisions are effective to predict choice behaviour."

Graphical plots were also used for model comparison.The learning-based systems obtained encouraging prediction results. Sensitivity analyses of the four environmental factors showed that temperature and, to a lesser extent, NaCl had the most influence on accuracy in predicting the growth rate of Leuconostoc mesenteroides under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The observed effectiveness of ANFIS for modeling microbial kinetic parameters confirms its potential use as a supplemental tool in predictive mycology. Comparisons between growth rates predicted by ANFIS and actual experimental data also confirmed the high accuracy of the Gaussian membership function in ANFIS. Comparisons of the six statistical indices under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions also showed that the ANFIS model was better than all ANN models in predicting the four kinetic parameters. Therefore, the ANFIS model is a valuable tool for quickly predicting the growth rate of Leuconostoc mesenteroides under aerobic and anaerobic conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2073610398,"The haemostatic relevance of antithrombin together with the low genetic variability of SERPINC1, and the high heritability of plasma levels encourage the search for modulating genes. We used a hypothesis-free approach to identify these genes, evaluating associations between plasma antithrombin and 307,984 polymorphisms in the GAIT study (352 individuals from 21 Spanish families). Despite no SNP reaching the genome wide significance threshold, we verified milder positive associations in 307 blood donors from a different cohort. This validation study suggested LARGE, a gene encoding a protein with xylosyltransferase and glucuronyltransferase activities that forms heparin-like linear polysaccharides, as a potential modulator of antithrombin based on the significant association of one SNPs, rs762057, with anti-FXa activity, particularly after adjustment for age, sex and SERPINC1 rs2227589 genotype, all factors influencing antithrombin levels (p = 0.02). Additional results sustained this association. LARGE silencing inHepG2 and HEK-EBNA cells did not affect SERPINC1 mRNA levels but significantly reduced the secretion of antithrombin with moderate intracellular retention. Milder effects were observed on α1-antitrypsin, prothrombin and transferrin. Our study suggests LARGE as the first known modifier of plasma antithrombin, and proposes a new role for LARGE in modulating extracellular secretion of certain glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1977021553,"While all ciliates possess nuclear dimorphism, several ciliates – like those in the classes Phyllopharyngea, Spirotrichea, and Armophorea – have an extreme macronuclear organization. Their extensively fragmented macronuclei contain upwards of 20,000 chromosomes, each with upwards of thousands of copies. These features have evolved independently on multiple occasions throughout ciliate evolutionary history, and currently no models explain these structures in an evolutionary context. In this paper, we propose that competition between two forces – the limitation and avoidance of chromosomal imbalances as a ciliate undergoes successive asexual divisions, and the costs of replicating massive genomes – is sufficient to explain this particular nuclear structure. We present a simulation of ciliate cell evolution under control of these forces, allowing certain features of the population to change over time. Over a wide range of parameters, we observe the repeated emergence of this unusual genomic organization found in nature. Although much remains to be understood about the evolution of macronuclear genome organization, our results show that the proposed model is a plausible explanation for the emergence of these extremely fragmented, highly polyploid genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2010866873,"Objectives To investigate whether normal variation of adult height is associated with clinical characteristics in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including disease activity (DAS28), impairment of joint function (mechanical joint score, MJS) and overall disability (health assessment questionnaire, HAQ). Methods A cohort (134 males, 287 females) of consecutively recruited RA patients of Northern European origin was studied. Height, weight and demographic information were obtained. A core set of disease measurements, including DAS28, MJS and HAQ, were recorded at baseline, 12 and 24 months. Other clinical variables (e.g. disease duration, IgM rheumatoid factor, antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) were recorded at baseline. Socioeconomic status, smoking status, comorbid condition, other autoimmune conditions and drug therapy were also recorded. Associations were analyzed using univariate statistics and multivariate linear regression models. Mediation tests were also carried out for evaluating the relationship between gender, height and disease measures. Results In males, height was inversely associated with DAS28, MJS and HAQ (at baseline and over 24 months) independent of other factors (e.g. weight, body mass index, age, disease duration, osteoporosis, autoantibodies, erosive disease, joint replacement, steroid use, smoking status, socioeconomic status and comorbid disease). In females, a similar trend was seen but the relationships were non significant. In the whole population, the association of female gender with more active disease and poor function disappeared after adjustment for height. Mediation analysis indicated that height served as a full mediator in the relationship of gender with disease activity and overall disability. Confirmation of these findings was demonstrated in a second RA population (n = 288). Conclusion Adult height is inversely associated with disease activity, impairment of joint function and overall disability in RA, particularly in males. The association of female sex with more severe disease activity and disability appears to be mediated by smaller stature."
https://openalex.org/W2008407573,"We have designed a dodecamer d-AGATCTAGATCT (RY12) with alternate oligopurines and oligopyrimidines tracts and its homologous 28 bp hairpin oligomer (RY28) that forms a triple helix only in the presence of a pentapeptide REWER. An intermolecular triplex is formed by the single strand invasion of the RY28 duplex by RY12 in the presence of REWER. 5'- oligopurine end of RY12 binds to oligopurine sequence of RY28 in a parallel orientation and its oligopyrimidine stretch then changes strand and adopts an antiparallel orientation with the other strand of the duplex. Evidence for the formation of the triplex come from our studies of the UV melting curves, UV mixing curves, gel retardation assay, and chemical sequencing of 1∶1 mixture of dodecamer and hairpin oligonucleotides in the presence and absence of the peptide REWER. RY12 exists as a duplex that melts at 35°C. The hairpin (RY28) melts at 68°C. 1∶1 mixture of RY12 and RY28 in the absence of REWER gives a biphasic transition curve with thermodynamic properties corresponding to those of the melting of the duplex of RY12 and the hairpin RY28. However, the melting curve of this mixture is triphasic in the presence of the REWER; the thermodynamic parameters associated with the first phase (melting of the duplex of RY12), second phase (melting of the triplex) and the third phase (melting of the hairpin) show dependence on the molar ratio of peptide to oligonucleotides. Under appropriate conditions, gel retardation assay showed a shifted band that corresponds to a possible triplex. Chemical sequencing of KMnO4 and DEPC treated mixture of RY12, RY28 and REWER revealed the footprint of triplex."
