A similar phenomena in periodic elastic structures can be used to manipulate mechanical vibrations. Here we present the design and experimental realization of strongly coupled optical and mechanical modes in a planar, periodic nanostructure on a silicon chip. 200-Terahertz photons are co-localized with mechanical modes of Gigahertz frequency and 100-femtogram mass. The effective coupling length, which describes the strength of the photon-phonon interaction, is as small as 2.9 microns, which, together with minute oscillator mass, allows all-optical actuation and transduction of nanomechanical motion with near quantum-limited sensitivity. Optomechanical crystals have many potential applications, from RF-over-optical communication to the study of quantum effects in mesoscopic mechanical systems."

To confirm additional risk loci, we selected SNPs from 2,466 regions that showed nominal evidence of association to SLE (P < 0.05) in a genome-wide study and genotyped them in an independent sample of 1,963 cases and 4,329 controls. This replication effort identified five new SLE susceptibility loci (P < 5 x 10(-8)): TNIP1 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.27), PRDM1 (OR = 1.20), JAZF1 (OR = 1.20), UHRF1BP1 (OR = 1.17) and IL10 (OR = 1.19). We identified 21 additional candidate loci with P< or = 1 x 10(-5). A candidate screen of alleles previously associated with other autoimmune diseases suggested five loci (P < 1 x 10(-3)) that may contribute to SLE: IFIH1, CFB, CLEC16A, IL12B and SH2B3. These results expand the number of confirmed and candidate SLE susceptibility loci and implicate several key immunologic pathways in SLE pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2026759417,"In vivo imaging of mammary carcinoma cells reveals that activation of a TGFβ-induced transcriptional response induces the motility of individual cells, allowing them to spread through the blood stream. In the absence of TGFβ, cells migrate as groups and can only metastasize through the lymphatic system. Here we use intravital imaging to demonstrate a reversible transition to a motile state as breast cancer cells spread. Imaging primary tumours revealed heterogeneity in cell morphology and motility. Two distinct modes of motility were observed: collective and single-celled. By monitoring the localization of Smad2 and the activity of a TGFβ-dependent reporter gene during breast cancer cell dissemination, we demonstrate that TGFβ signalling is transiently and locally activated in motile single cells. TGFβ1 switches cells from cohesive to single cell motility through a transcriptional program involving Smad4, EGFR, Nedd9, M-RIP, FARP and RhoC. Blockade of TGFβ signalling prevented cells moving singly in vivo but did not inhibit cells moving collectively. Cells restricted to collective invasion were capable of lymphatic invasion but not blood-borne metastasis. Constitutive TGFβ signalling promoted single cell motility and intravasation but reduced subsequent growth in the lungs. Thus, transient TGFβ signalling is essential for blood-borne metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1987294127,"Aneuploidy and translocations are hallmarks of B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but many individuals with this cancer lack recurring chromosomal alterations. Here we report a recurring interstitial deletion of the pseudoautosomal region 1 of chromosomes X and Y in B-progenitor ALL that juxtaposes the first, noncoding exon of P2RY8 with the coding region of CRLF2. We identified the P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion in 7% of individuals with B-progenitor ALL and 53% of individuals with ALL associated with Down syndrome. CRLF2 alteration was associated with activating JAK mutations, and expression of human P2RY8-CRLF2 together with mutated mouse Jak2 resulted in constitutive Jak-Stat activation and cytokine-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells overexpressing interleukin-7 receptor alpha. Our findings indicate that these two genetic lesions together contribute to leukemogenesis in B-progenitor ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2168414233,"Behavioral expression of food-associated memory in fruit flies is constrained by satiety and promoted by hunger, suggesting an influence of motivational state. Here, we identify a neural mechanism that integrates the internal state of hunger and appetitive memory. We show that stimulation of neurons that express neuropeptide F (dNPF), an ortholog of mammalian NPY, mimics food deprivation and promotes memory performance in satiated flies. Robust appetitive memory performance requires the dNPF receptor in six dopaminergic neurons that innervate a distinct region of the mushroom bodies. Blocking these dopaminergic neurons releases memory performance in satiated flies, whereas stimulation suppresses memory performance in hungry flies. Therefore, dNPF and dopamine provide a motivational switch in the mushroom body that controls the output of appetitive memory.

Therefore, dNPF and dopamine provide a motivational switch in the mushroom body that controls the output of appetitive memory. Motivation provides behavior with purpose and intensity and ensures that particular motor actions are expressed at the appropriate time. Although the concept of motivation has interested psychologists and ethologists for decades (Hull, 1951Hull C.L. Essentials of Behavior.

Animal motivation: the beginning of the end?.in: Jermy T. Chapman R.F. Bernays E.A. Stoffolano J.G. Perspectives in Chemoreception and Behavior. Springer, New York1987Google Scholar), a detailed neurobiological perspective of the mechanisms underlying state-dependent changes in behavior is lacking. Understanding how motivational systems are organized in the brain and how they impact neural circuits that direct behavior is a major question in neurobiology and addresses the functional connection between body and mind. Hunger is perhaps the most heavily studied of the regulatory, or homeostatic, motivational drive states because food availability is easily manipulated in the laboratory. Hunger results from internally generated metabolic deficit signals, and these signals in turn increase the likelihood that the animal initiates food-seeking behavior (Dethier, 1976Dethier V.G. The Hungry Fly - A Physiological Study of the Behaviour. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1976Google Scholar, Saper et al., 2002Saper C.B. Chou T.C. Elmquist J.K.

Horvath T.L. Brain circuits regulating energy homeostasis.Regul. Pept. 2008; 149: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Models of motivation include learned representations of cues associated with food, such as smell and taste, that provide additional incentive and direction to locate a particular food source (Hull, 1951Hull C.L. Essentials of Behavior. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1951Google Scholar, Toates, 1986Toates F.M. Motivational Systems. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1986Google Scholar). When the food is located and consumed, the homeostatic process comes full-circle and the motivational drive to feed is neutralized. However, it is unclear how neural systems representing hunger and satiety are integrated with those of memory. The idea that motivation could be approached experimentally in insects followed seminal studies of food-seeking behavior in the blowfly Phormia regina (Dethier, 1976Dethier V.G. The Hungry Fly - A Physiological Study of the Behaviour. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1976Google Scholar). It was noted that although exposing gustatory receptor neurons on the proboscis to sugar always generated an electrophysiological response, the blowfly did not consistently respond by extending the proboscis. However, a food-deprived blowfly was more likely to respond with proboscis extension. A sophisticated genetic toolkit for manipulating neural circuits (Keene and Waddell, 2007Keene A.C. Waddell S. Drosophila olfactory memory: single genes to complex neural circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) coupled with robust behaviors makes the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster ideal to understand the physiological mechanism that underlies such state-dependent behavior. Drosophila can be efficiently trained to associate odorants with sucrose reward (Tempel et al., 1983Tempel B.L. Bonini N. Dawson D.R. Quinn W.G. Reward learning in normal and mutant Drosophila.Proc.

Rapid consolidation to a radish and protein synthesis-dependent long-term memory after single-session appetitive olfactory conditioning in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3103-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Importantly, fruit flies have to be hungry to effectively express appetitive memory performance (Krashes and Waddell, 2008Krashes M.J. Waddell S. Rapid consolidation to a radish and protein synthesis-dependent long-term memory after single-session appetitive olfactory conditioning in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3103-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This apparent state dependence implies that signals for hunger and satiety may interact with memory circuitry to regulate the behavioral expression of learned food-seeking behavior. The mushroom body (MB) in the fly brain is a critical site for appetitive memory (Schwaerzel et al., 2003Schwaerzel M. Monastirioti M. Scholz H. Friggi-Grelin F. Birman S. Heisenberg M.

Synaptic output from the MB α′β′ neurons is required to consolidate appetitive memory whereas output from the αβ subset is specifically required for memory retrieval (Krashes et al., 2007Krashes M.J.

This anatomy provides a foundation for understanding neural circuit integration between systems representing a motivational state and those for memory. neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a highly conserved 36 amino acid neuromodulator that stimulates food-seeking behavior in mammals (Tatemoto et al., 1982Tatemoto K.

NPY messenger RNA (mRNA) levels are elevated in neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus of food-deprived mice (Sahu et al., 1988Sahu A. Kalra P.S. Kalra S.P.

USA. 1985; 82: 3940-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Most impressively, ablation of NPY-expressing neurons from adult mice leads to starvation (Bewick et al., 2005Bewick G.A.

NPY exerts its effects through a family of NPY receptors and appears to have inhibitory function (Colmers et al., 1988Colmers W.F. Lukowiak K. Pittman Q.J.

NPY and Y receptors: lessons from transgenic and knockout models.Neuropeptides. 2004; 38: 189-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). NPY therefore must repress the action of inhibitory pathways in order to promote feeding behavior. Drosophila neuropeptide F (dNPF) is an ortholog of NPY, which has a C-terminal amidated phenylalanine instead of the amidated tyrosine in vertebrates (Brown et al., 1999Brown M.R. Crim J.W. Arata R.C. Cai H.N. Chun C. Shen P. Identification of a Drosophila brain-gut peptide related to the neuropeptide Y family.Peptides. 1999; 20: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that dNPF plays a similar role in appetitive behavior in flies. dNPF overexpression prolongs feeding in larvae and delays the developmental transition from foraging to pupariation (Wu et al., 2003Wu Q. Wen T. Lee G. Park J.H. Cai H.N. Shen P. Developmental control of foraging and social behavior by the Drosophila neuropeptide Y-like system.Neuron. 2003; 39: 147-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of a dNPF receptor gene, npfr1 (Garczynski et al., 2002Garczynski S.F. Brown M.R. Shen P. Murray T.F. Crim J.W. Characterization of a functional neuropeptide F receptor from Drosophila melanogaster.Peptides. 2002; 23: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), causes well-fed larvae to eat bitter-tasting food that wild-type larvae will only consume if they are hungry (Wu et al., 2005Wu Q. Zhao Z. Shen P. Regulation of aversion to noxious food by Drosophila neuropeptide Y- and insulin-like systems.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1350-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In this study, we exploited dNPF to identify a neural circuit that participates in motivational control of appetitive memory behavior in adult fruit flies. We show that stimulation of dNPF neurons promotes appetitive memory performance in fed flies, mimicking the hungry state. npfr1 is required in dopaminergic (DA) neurons that innervate the MB for satiety to suppress appetitive memory performance. Directly blocking the DA neurons during memory testing reveals performance in fed flies, whereas stimulating them suppresses performance in hungry flies. These data suggest that six DA neurons are a key module of dNPF-regulated circuitry, through which the internal motivational states of hunger and satiety are represented in the MB. Feeding of flies after appetitive conditioning suppresses memory performance (Figure 1A) and the suppression is reversed by restarvation (Krashes and Waddell, 2008Krashes M.J. Waddell S. Rapid consolidation to a radish and protein synthesis-dependent long-term memory after single-session appetitive olfactory conditioning in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3103-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Food deprivation is also required for efficient appetitive learning, but a learning defect could simply result from satiated flies failing to ingest the reinforcing sucrose. In this study, we specifically manipulated memory retrieval, and in all experiments we ensured that flies were efficiently trained by food depriving them for 18 hr before training. Immediately after training, we transferred flies to vials with, or without, food for 3 hr before testing appetitive memory. Flies starved before and after training display robust appetitive memory, but memory performance steadily declines after 10–30 min of feeding (Figure 1A), indicating a continuum of performance relative to the satiety state of the flies. Immunostaining for dNPF in adult fly brains reveals neurons in the subesophageal ganglion (SOG), the dorsal and lateral protocerebrum, and the central complex (CC) (Wen et al., 2005Wen T. Parrish C.A. Xu D. Wu Q. Shen P. Drosophila neuropeptide F and its receptor, NPFR1, define a signaling pathway that acutely modulates alcohol sensitivity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). One can control some of these neurons by using a dNPF promoter-driven GAL4 to express GAL4-uas promoter-driven transgenes (Wen et al., 2005Wen T. Parrish C.A. Xu D. Wu Q. Shen P. Drosophila neuropeptide F and its receptor, NPFR1, define a signaling pathway that acutely modulates alcohol sensitivity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). dNPF-GAL4 driven uas-CD8::GFP labels most of the dNPF-immunoreactive neurons whose cell bodies reside in the dorsal protocerebrum but not those whose somata are clustered in the SOG (Figure 1B, and Figure S1 available online). We reasoned that dNPF release might represent the food-deprived state in the brain, and so we tested whether stimulation of dNPF-expressing neurons could override the suppression of memory performance by feeding. We expressed the heat-sensitive uas-dTrpA1 transgene (Hamada et al., 2008Hamada F.N. Rosenzweig M. Kang K. Pulver S.R. Ghezzi A. Jegla T.J. Garrity P.A. An internal thermal sensor controlling temperature preference in Drosophila.Nature. 2008; 454: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) with dNPF-GAL4. dTrpA1 encodes a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel that is required in a small number of neurons in the brain for temperature preference in Drosophila (Hamada et al., 2008Hamada F.N. Rosenzweig M. Kang K. Pulver S.R. Ghezzi A. Jegla T.J. Garrity P.A. An internal thermal sensor controlling temperature preference in Drosophila.Nature. 2008; 454: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Ectopically expressed dTRPA1 conducts Ca2+ and depolarizes neurons when flies are exposed to >25°C, allowing one to stimulate specific neurons. We first food deprived and trained wild-type, dNPF-GAL4, uas-dTrpA1, and dNPF-GAL4;uas-dTrpA1 flies, fed them ad libitum for 3 hr, and tested appetitive memory at the permissive 23°C. No group showed robust appetitive memory under these conditions (Figure 1C), and no statistical differences were apparent between groups (p > 0.57). However, stimulation of dNPF neurons for 30 min before and during testing by shifting the flies to 31°C revealed memory performance in dNPF-GAL4;uas-dTrpA1 flies that was statistically different from all other groups (p < 0.006)(Figure 1D). Therefore, stimulation of dNPF neurons mimics food deprivation, consistent with dNPF being a key factor in the internal state of hunger in the brain. We used a uas-RNA interference (RNAi) transgene against the dNPF receptor, uas-npfr1RNAi (Wu et al., 2003Wu Q. Wen T. Lee G. Park J.H. Cai H.N. Shen P.

Zhao Z. Shen P. Regulation of aversion to noxious food by Drosophila neuropeptide Y- and insulin-like systems.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1350-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) to localize the relevant dNPF-modulated neurons, reasoning that npfr1 disruption would impair appetitive memory in hungry flies. We verified the efficacy of the uas-npfr1RNAi transgene for our purpose by expressing it in all neurons using n-synaptobrevin-GAL4 and testing appetitive memory performance. As expected, the memory performance of uas-npfr1RNAi;n-syb-GAL4 flies was impaired and was statistically different from all other control groups (p < 0.04). However, uas-npfr1RNAi;n-syb-GAL4 flies were normal for aversive olfactory conditioning (Tully and Quinn, 1985Tully T. Quinn W.G. Classical conditioning and retention in normal and mutant Drosophila melanogaster.J. Comp. Physiol. [A]. 1985; 157: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) (Figure S2). We next drove uas-npfr1RNAi with GAL4 drivers that express in the dorsal protocerebrum and CC—c005, 210Y, 104Y, and c061 and in all MB neurons or the MB αβ and γ neurons—OK107, and MB247. We food deprived wild-type flies, flies with a piggyBac element in the npfr1 locus, npfr1[c01896] (Bellen et al., 2004Bellen H.J. Levis R.W. Liao G. He Y. Carlson J.W. Tsang G. Evans-Holm M. Hiesinger P.R. Schulze K.L. Rubin G.M. et al.The BDGP gene disruption project: single transposon insertions associated with 40% of Drosophila genes.Genetics. 2004; 167: 761-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), flies expressing uas-npfr1RNAi in specific neurons, and flies harboring GAL4 or uas-npfr1RNAi alone and tested appetitive memory 3 hr after training. The performance of npfr1[c01896] and c061;uas-npfr1RNAi flies was statistically different (both p < 0.01) from all other flies (Figure 2). These data suggest c061 neurons mediate the effects of dNPF on appetitive memory expression. We visualized c061 neurons with uas-CD8::GFP. Confocal analysis revealed expression, including intrinsic neurons of the MBs (Figure 3A). Since MB expression of uas-npfr1RNAi did not disrupt memory (Figure 2), we crossed in a GAL80 transgene that blocks GAL4 activity in all MB neurons (MBGAL80) (Krashes et al., 2007Krashes M.J. Keene A.C. Leung B. Armstrong J.D. Waddell S. Sequential use of mushroom body neuron subsets during drosophila odor memory processing.Neuron. 2007; 53: 103-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). MBGAL80 abolished MB expression, but prominent expression remained in three neurons per hemisphere, whose projections densely innervate the MB heel and peduncle. Another cluster of five neurons per hemisphere innervate a specific layer in the fan-shaped body of the CC (Figure 3B and Movies S1 and S2). Higher-resolution imaging revealed innervation of the MB peduncle occupied by αβ but not α′β′ neurons (Figure 3E). Output from α′β′ neurons is required to consolidate appetitive memory, whereas output from αβ neurons is required for appetitive memory retrieval (Krashes et al., 2007Krashes M.J. Keene A.C. Leung B.

Finding neurons that innervate the MB heel and αβ neurons is consistent with a model where satiety affects memory retrieval by modulating MB αβ and γ neurons. Some DA neurons innervate the MB heel and base of the peduncle (Friggi-Grelin et al., 2003Friggi-Grelin F. Coulom H. Meller M. Gomez D. Hirsh J. Birman S.

We therefore immunostained c061;MBGAL80;uas-CD8::GFP brains with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibody. TH specifically labels DA neurons in flies because they do not produce epinephrine or norepinephrine. This analysis revealed that the three c061 MB-innervating neurons double label with GFP and anti-TH (Figure 3F), consistent with them releasing dopamine. Their position by the MB calyx defines them as belonging to the protocerebral posterior lateral 1 (PPL1) DA neuron cluster (Friggi-Grelin et al., 2003Friggi-Grelin F. Coulom H. Meller M. Gomez D.

Finding the MB-innervating neurons label for TH allowed us to use a TH promoter-driven GAL80 (THGAL80) to remove DA neuron expression (Sitaraman et al., 2008Sitaraman D. Zars M. Laferriere H. Chen Y.C. Sable-Smith A. Kitamoto T. Rottinghaus G.E. Zars T. Serotonin is necessary for place memory in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 5579-5584Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We combined c061 and c061;MBGAL80 with THGAL80 and uas-CD8::GFP and visualized brains colabeled with anti-TH. THGAL80 suppressed expression in DA neuron somata (Figures 3C, 3D, and 3G) and eliminated expression in processes innervating the heel and peduncle region of the MB (Figures 3C and 3D). Expression remained in c061;THGAL80 brains in MB, the fan-shaped body, and SOG (Figure 3C). In c061;MBGAL80/THGAL80 brains, expression remained in the fan-shaped body and SOG (Figure 3D). Therefore, c061 DA neurons innervate the dorsal protocerebrum and MB heel and peduncle. Transgenic markers of neural polarity suggest DA processes in the dorsal protocerebrum are postsynaptic, whereas those in the MB heel and peduncle are presynaptic (Zhang et al., 2007Zhang K. Guo J.Z. Peng Y. Xi W. Guo A. Dopamine-mushroom body circuit regulates saliency-based decision-making in Drosophila.Science. 2007; 316: 1901-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We tested the importance of npfr1 in DA neurons by expressing uas-npfr1RNAi with TH-GAL4. We food-deprived flies before and after training and tested 3 hr appetitive memory. Performance of TH-GAL4;uas-npfr1RNAi flies was statistically different from that of wild-type, TH-GAL4, and uas-npfr1RNAi control flies (p < 0.01; Figure 4A). We also used THGAL80 to test whether DA neuron expression was required for the appetitive memory defect of c061;uas-npfr1RNAi flies. Memory of c061;THGAL80;uas-npfr1RNAi flies was statistically indistinguishable from that of controls (p > 0.9) and was statistically different from that of c061;uas-npfr1RNAi and TH-GAL4;uas-npfr1RNAi flies (Figure 4A). Therefore, npfr1 expression is required in DA neurons that innervate the MB for appetitive memory performance in hungry flies. We used c061;MBGAL80 and THGAL80 to test whether DA neurons were responsible for inhibiting memory performance in fed flies. We directly blocked their output during memory testing with the dominant temperature-sensitive uas-shibirets1 (shits1) transgene (Kitamoto, 2001Kitamoto T. Conditional modification of behavior in Drosophila by targeted expression of a temperature-sensitive shibire allele in defined neurons.J. Neurobiol. 2001; 47: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). shits1 blocks membrane recycling and thus synaptic vesicle release at the restrictive temperature of 31°C and this blockade is reversible by returning flies to <25°C. Flies were food deprived, trained, and immediately transferred to vials containing food before testing of 3 hr memory. We performed this experiment at 23°C throughout (Figure 4B), or we blocked the neurons prior to and during memory retrieval by shifting flies to 31°C for 1 hr before testing (Figure 4C). We tested wild-type and single-transgene GAL4 and uas-shits1 flies in parallel. At 23°C, performance was suppressed by feeding, and there were no significant differences between groups (p > 0.77; Figure 4B). However, when c061;MBGAL80;uas-shits1 neurons were blocked prior to and during retrieval, appetitive memory performance was statistically different from all other groups (all p < 0.04; Figure 4C). Expression of uas-shits1 in c061;MBGAL80 neurons except the DA neurons did not enhance performance (Figure 4C). Memory of c061;MBGAL80/THGAL80;uas-shits1 flies was statistically indistinguishable from that of the control groups (p > 0.99). Importantly, blocking DA neurons did not further enhance hungry fly performance (all p > 0.17; Figure 4D). Therefore, these data are consistent with the DA neurons limiting memory performance in fed flies. It is likely that dopamine provides the inhibition because the DA neurons do not label for the inhibitory transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA; Figure S3). Similar neurons tha"

Here, we identify growing nerves projecting throughout the body as a stem/progenitor niche containing Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) from which large numbers of skin melanocytes originate. SCPs arise as a result of lack of neuronal specification by Hmx1 homeobox gene function in the neural crest ventral migratory pathway. Schwann cell and melanocyte development share signaling molecules with both the glial and melanocyte cell fates intimately linked to nerve contact and regulated in an opposing manner by Neuregulin and soluble signals including insulin-like growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. These results reveal SCPs as a cellular origin of melanocytes, and have broad implications on the molecular mechanisms regulating skin pigmentation during development, in health and pigmentation disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2060712542,"Many mitochondrial proteins are synthesized with N-terminal presequences that are removed by specific peptidases. The N-termini of the mature proteins and thus peptidase cleavage sites have only been determined for a small fraction of mitochondrial proteins and yielded a controversial situation for the cleavage site specificity of the major mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP). We report a global analysis of the N-proteome of yeast mitochondria, revealing the N-termini of 615 different proteins. Significantly more proteins than predicted contained cleavable presequences. We identified the intermediate cleaving peptidase Icp55, which removes an amino acid from a characteristic set of MPP-generated N-termini, solving the controversial situation of MPP specificity and suggesting that Icp55 converts instable intermediates into stable proteins. Our results suggest that Icp55 is critical for stabilization of the mitochondrial proteome and illustrate how the N-proteome can serve as rich source for a systematic analysis of mitochondrial protein targeting, cleavage and turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2065884484,"Topoisomerase I (Top1) is a key enzyme in functioning at the interface between DNA replication, transcription and mRNA maturation. Here, we show that Top1 suppresses genomic instability in mammalian cells by preventing a conflict between transcription and DNA replication. Using DNA combing and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)-on-chip, we found that Top1-deficient cells accumulate stalled replication forks and chromosome breaks in S phase, and that breaks occur preferentially at gene-rich regions of the genome. Notably, these phenotypes were suppressed by preventing the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) during transcription. Moreover, these defects could be mimicked by depletion of the splicing factor ASF/SF2 (alternative splicing factor/splicing factor 2), which interacts functionally with Top1. Taken together, these data indicate that Top1 prevents replication fork collapse by suppressing the formation of R-loops in an ASF/SF2-dependent manner. We propose that interference between replication and transcription represents a major source of spontaneous replication stress, which could drive genomic instability during the early stages of tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2137171341,"Dopaminergic neurons are thought to drive learning by signaling changes in the expectations of salient events, such as rewards or punishments. Olfactory conditioning in Drosophila requires direct dopamine action on intrinsic mushroom body neurons, the likely storage sites of olfactory memories. Neither the cellular sources of the conditioning dopamine nor its precise postsynaptic targets are known. By optically controlling genetically circumscribed subsets of dopaminergic neurons in the behaving fly, we have mapped the origin of aversive reinforcement signals to the PPL1 cluster of 12 dopaminergic cells. PPL1 projections target restricted domains in the vertical lobes and heel of the mushroom body. Artificially evoked activity in a small number of identifiable cells thus suffices for programming behaviorally meaningful memories. The delineation of core reinforcement circuitry is an essential first step in dissecting the neural mechanisms that compute and represent valuations, store associations, and guide actions."
https://openalex.org/W1999408122,"Wnts play pivotal roles during development and in the mature nervous system. However, the mechanism by which Wnts traffic between cells has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate a mechanism of Wnt transmission through release of exosome-like vesicles containing the Wnt-binding protein Evenness Interrupted/Wntless/Sprinter (Evi/Wls/Srt). We show that at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), presynaptic vesicular release of Evi is required for the secretion of the Wnt, Wingless (Wg). We also show that Evi acts cell-autonomously in the postsynaptic Wnt-receiving cell to target dGRIP, a Wg-receptor-interacting protein, to postsynaptic sites. Upon Evi loss of function, dGRIP is not properly targeted to synaptic sites, interfering with postsynaptic Wnt signal transduction. These findings uncover a previously unknown cellular mechanism by which a secreted Wnt is transported across synapses by Evi-containing vesicles and reveal trafficking functions of Evi in both the Wnt-producing and the Wnt-receiving cells.

https://openalex.org/W2077929218,"Autophagy is an active homeostatic degradation process for the removal or turnover of cytoplasmic components wherein the LC3 ubiquitin-like protein undergoes an Atg7 E1-like enzyme/Atg3 E2-like enzyme-mediated conjugation process to induce autophagosome biogenesis. Besides its cytoprotective role, autophagy acts on cell death when it is abnormally upregulated. Thus, the autophagy pathway requires tight regulation to ensure that this degradative process is well balanced. Two death effector domains (DED1/2) containing cellular FLICE-like inhibitor protein (cFLIP) and viral FLIP (vFLIP) of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), and Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) protect cells from apoptosis mediated by death receptors. Here, we report that cellular and viral FLIPs suppress autophagy by preventing Atg3 from binding and processing LC3. Consequently, FLIP expression effectively represses cell death with autophagy, as induced by rapamycin, an mTor inhibitor and an effective anti-tumour drug against KSHV-induced Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). Remarkably, either a DED1 alpha2-helix ten amino-acid (alpha2) peptide or a DED2 alpha4-helix twelve amino-acid (alpha4) peptide of FLIP is individually sufficient for binding FLIP itself and Atg3, with the peptide interactions effectively suppressing Atg3-FLIP interaction without affecting Atg3-LC3 interaction, resulting in robust cell death with autophagy. Our study thus identifies a checkpoint of the autophagy pathway where cellular and viral FLIPs limit the Atg3-mediated step of LC3 conjugation to regulate autophagosome biogenesis. Furthermore, the FLIP-derived short peptides induce growth suppression and cell death with autophagy, representing biologically active molecules for potential anti-cancer therapies."

We crossed two distinct APP transgenic mouse strains with CD11b-HSVTK mice, in which nearly complete ablation of microglia was achieved for up to 4 weeks after ganciclovir application.

https://openalex.org/W2116505573,"Macrophages rapidly engulf apoptotic cells to limit the release of noxious cellular contents and to restrict autoimmune responses against self antigens. Although factors participating in recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells have been identified, the transcriptional basis for the sensing and the silent disposal of apoptotic cells is unknown. Here we show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR-delta) is induced when macrophages engulf apoptotic cells and functions as a transcriptional sensor of dying cells. Genetic deletion of PPAR-delta decreases expression of opsonins such as complement component-1qb (C1qb), resulting in impairment of apoptotic cell clearance and reduction in anti-inflammatory cytokine production. This increases autoantibody production and predisposes global and macrophage-specific Ppard(-/-) mice to autoimmune kidney disease, a phenotype resembling the human disease systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, PPAR-delta has a pivotal role in orchestrating the timely disposal of apoptotic cells by macrophages, ensuring that tolerance to self is maintained."
https://openalex.org/W1978984304,"Hepatic insulin resistance is often associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to defects in cellular activity. Morris White and his colleagues have now found that continued activity of the transcription factor Foxo1, which is normally inhibited by insulin signaling, is at the crux of this dysfunction, and, when it is genetically deleted, proper mitochondrial function in two models of insulin resistance is restored. Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease that is marked by the dysfunction of glucose and lipid metabolism. Hepatic insulin resistance is especially pathogenic in type 2 diabetes, as it dysregulates fasting and postprandial glucose tolerance and promotes systemic dyslipidemia and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease1,2. Mitochondrial dysfunction is closely associated with insulin resistance and might contribute to the progression of diabetes3,4. Here we used previously generated mice5 with hepatic insulin resistance owing to the deletion of the genes encoding insulin receptor substrate-1 (Irs-1) and Irs-2 (referred to here as double-knockout (DKO) mice) to establish the molecular link between dysregulated insulin action and mitochondrial function. The expression of several forkhead box O1 (Foxo1) target genes increased in the DKO liver, including heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1), which disrupts complex III and IV of the respiratory chain and lowers the NAD+/NADH ratio and ATP production. Although peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (Ppargc-1α) was also upregulated in DKO liver, it was acetylated and failed to promote compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis or function. Deletion of hepatic Foxo1 in DKO liver normalized the expression of Hmox1 and the NAD+/NADH ratio, reduced Ppargc-1α acetylation and restored mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and biogenesis. Thus, Foxo1 integrates insulin signaling with mitochondrial function, and inhibition of Foxo1 can improve hepatic metabolism during insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2061271326,"The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Olig1 promotes oligodendrocyte maturation and is required for myelin repair. We characterized an Olig1-regulated G protein-coupled receptor, GPR17, whose function is to oppose the action of Olig1. Gpr17 was restricted to oligodendrocyte lineage cells, but was downregulated during the peak period of myelination and in adulthood. Transgenic mice with sustained Gpr17 expression in oligodendrocytes exhibited stereotypic features of myelinating disorders in the CNS. Gpr17 overexpression inhibited oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation both in vivo and in vitro. Conversely, Gpr17 knockout mice showed early onset of oligodendrocyte myelination. The opposing action of Gpr17 on oligodendrocyte maturation reflects, at least partially, upregulation and nuclear translocation of the potent oligodendrocyte differentiation inhibitors ID2/4. Collectively, these findings suggest that GPR17 orchestrates the transition between immature and myelinating oligodendrocytes via an ID protein-mediated negative regulation and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for CNS myelin repair."

These parameters correlated with circuit performance. Circuits produced similar outputs because of compensatory and coordinated changes among the parameters. How different are the neuronal circuits for a given behavior across individual animals? To address this question, we measured multiple cellular and synaptic parameters in individual preparations to see how they correlated with circuit function, using neurons and synapses in the pyloric circuit of the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab Cancer borealis. There was considerable preparation-to-preparation variability in the strength of two identified synapses, in the amplitude of a modulator-evoked current and in the expression of six ion channel genes. Nonetheless, we found strong correlations across preparations among these parameters and attributes of circuit performance. These data illustrate the importance of making multidimensional measurements from single preparations for understanding how variability in circuit output is related to the variability of multiple circuit parameters."

This antiviral effect is counteracted by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) accessory protein viral protein U (Vpu). Here we show that HIV-1 Vpu physically interacts with BST-2 through their mutual transmembrane domains and leads to the degradation of this host factor via a lysosomal, not proteasomal, pathway. The degradation is partially controlled by a cellular protein, β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP), which is known to be required for the Vpu-induced degradation of CD4. Importantly, targeting of BST-2 by Vpu occurs at the plasma membrane followed by the active internalization of this host protein by Vpu independently of constitutive endocytosis. Thus, the primary site of action of Vpu is the plasma membrane, where Vpu targets and internalizes cell-surface BST-2 through transmembrane interactions, leading to lysosomal degradation, partially in a βTrCP-dependent manner.

This protein has an unusual topology, harboring an N-terminal CT domain followed by a TM domain, an extracellular coiled-coil domain, and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor at the C terminus (31.Kupzig S.

Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3850-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). At the cell surface, BST-2 resides in cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains (also called lipid rafts) through the GPI anchor, whereas its TM domain apparently lies outside the lipid rafts (31.Kupzig S.

Nature. 2008; 451: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar) speculated on several configurations, such as forms tethering virions to cell membranes, and to each other. However, the actual configuration remains unknown. As expected from the formation of tethers to capture enveloped viruses, BST-2 indeed shows broad-spectrum inhibition of the release of not only animal retroviruses, but also Ebola, Lassa, and Marburg viruses (34.Jouvenet N.

Herein, we show that the Vpu primary site of action is the plasma membrane, where this protein targets cell-surface BST-2 through their mutual TM-to-TM binding, leading to lysosomes, partially dependent on βTrCP. We also propose a possible configuration model of BST-2 to tether virions to the plasma membranes. The vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein expression vector pHIT/G (37.Fouchier R.A. Meyer B.E.

The lentiviral plasmids psPAX2 and pLVTHM (40.Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by D. Trono. The HIV-1 Vpu expression plasmid pCA-Vpu-RRE and HIV-1 Rev expression plasmid pCA-Rev were created by inserting a PCR-amplified NL4-3-derived vpu gene (nucleotide 6061–6306) together with a Rev-responsive element (RRE; nucleotide 7759–7992) and a rev gene (nucleotide 5969–6044, 8369–8643), respectively, into a mammalian expression plasmid pCAGGS (41.Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4618) Google Scholar). A CT deletion mutant of Vpu pCA-VpuΔCT-RRE was created by replacing the full-length Vpu of pCA-Vpu-RRE with a PCR-amplified TM domain of Vpu (amino acid residues 1–27). A chimeric mutant comprising the human CD4 TM and Vpu CT domains, pCA-CD4tmVpu-RRE, was created by replacing the TM domain of Vpu with that of CD4 (amino acid residues 398–420), using overlapping PCR-based cloning. Hemagglutinin (HA)- or enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged Vpu plasmids (pCA-Vpu-HA-RRE, pCA-VpuΔCT-HA-RRE, pCA-CD4tmVpu-HA-RRE, pCA-Vpu-EGFP-RRE, and pCA-CD4tmVpu-EGFP-RRE) were generated by inserting amplified Vpu fragments into a modified pCAGGS carrying a C-terminal HA tag with a RRE downstream of HA or into a modified pCAGGS carrying C-terminal EGFP tag with a RRE downstream of EGFP. A Vpu phosphorylation mutant pCA-Vpu2/6-RRE was created as previously described (12.Schubert U. Henklein P. Boldyreff B. Wingender E. Strebel K. Porstmann T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), by using pCA-Vpu-RRE as a template with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). A proviral Vpu phosphorylation mutant pNL-Vpu2/6-E- was similarly created except using pNL-E− as a template. Vpu- and envelope-deficient proviral clones, pNL-U−E− and pNL-Luc-U−E−, were generated by introducing a HpaI site at the vpu initiation codon of pNL-E− and pNL-Luc-E− using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis. To create a BST-2 expression plasmid pCA-BST-2, total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells using a RNAqueous Kit (Ambion) and was subjected to reverse transcription followed by amplification with specific oligonucleotides. The amplified fragments were cloned into pCAGGS. Extracellular FLAG- and Myc-tagged BST-2 expression plasmids (pCA-BST-2-exFLAG and pCA-BST-2-exMyc) were generated by inserting the FLAG or Myc fragments into an AflII site (nucleotide 429 of BST-2 gene) in pCA-BST-2. An endocytosis mutant (pCA-BST-2-Y6A/Y8A) was generated by using pCA-BST-2 as a template with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis. Chimeric versions between BST-2 and transferrin receptor (TfR) (42.Schneider C. Owen M.J. Banville D. Williams J.G. Nature. 1984; 311: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), pCA-TfRct/tm-BST-2, pCA-TfRct-BST-2, and pCA-TfRtm-BST-2 were created by replacing the N-terminal CT (amino acid residues 1–21) and TM domains (amino acid residues 22–43) of pCA-BST-2 with those of pTfR (kindly provided by Y. Takai; CT, amino acid residues 1–62; TM, 63–88), by replacing the CT domain of pCA-BST-2 with that of pTfR, and by replacing the TM domain of pCA-BST-2 with that of pTfR, respectively, using overlapping PCR-based cloning. A chimeric mutant of the human CD4 signal peptide and BST-2, pCA-BST-2-CD4sig, was generated by exchanging the CT with the TM domains of pCA-BST-2 for the CD4 signal peptide (amino acid residues 1–25) and an additional 10 residues of pNL-CD4 using the overlapping PCR-based cloning. A BST-2 mutant deleted of the GPI modification signal pCA-BST-2ΔGPI was created by inserting amplified BST-2 fragments deleted of the signal (amino acid residues 161–180) into pCAGGS. With regard to the mutant BST-2 plasmids described above, extracellular FLAG- and Myc-tagged versions were also constructed. To create βTrCP-1 and -2 expression plasmids (pCA-βTrCP-1-FLAG and pCA-βTrCP-2-FLAG), total RNA from MOLT-4 cells was subjected to reverse transcription followed by amplification with specific oligonucleotides. Amplified fragments were cloned into a modified pCAGGS carrying a C-terminal FLAG-tag. A CD4 expression plasmid pCA-CD4 was created by inserting a CD4 fragment amplified from pNL-CD4 into pCAGGS. To generate a dynamin-2 (Dyn2) expression plasmid (pCA-Dyn2), total RNA isolated from 293T cells was subjected to reverse transcription-PCR amplification of the Dyn2 gene using specific oligonucleotides. Amplified Dyn2 fragments were cloned into pCAGGS. A dominant-negative mutant of Dyn2 (pCA-Dyn2-K44A) was created by using pCA-Dyn2 as a template with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis. EGFP-tagged Dyn2 and Dyn2-K44A expression plasmids (pCA-Dyn2-EGFP and pCA-Dyn2-K44A-EGFP) were generated by introducing wild-type (WT) and mutant-derived Dyn2 fragments into a modified pCAGGS carrying the C-terminal EGFP tag. An EGFP expression plasmid, pCA-EGFP, was created by inserting a PCR-amplified EGFP fragment into pCAGGS. Plasmids expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against βTrCP-1 and βTrCP-2 were generated by inserting fragments containing sequences targeting βTrCP-1 (GCGTTGTATTCGATTTGATAA) and βTrCP-2 (GTGTCATTGTAACTGGCTCTT) into pLVTHM. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. HeLa, 293T, and COS7 cells were maintained under standard conditions. 293T cells were transfected with a BST-2 (WT or mutants) expression plasmid or HIV-1 proviral construct (Vpu-WT, -2/6, or -deficient) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell extracts from transfected cells were subjected to gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were probed with an anti-BST-2 mouse polyclonal antibody (Abnova) or an anti-Vpu serum (obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health; HIV-1 NL4-3 Vpu antiserum was from F. Maldarelli and K. Strebel (43.Maldarelli F. Chen M.Y. Willey R.L. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5056-5061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Reacted proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using an ECL Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare) and monitored using a LAS-3000 imaging system (FujiFilm). 7 × 105 293T cells were cotransfected with 0.95 μg of βTrCP-1 or βTrCP-2 shRNA, 0.95 μg of psPAX2, and 0.1 μg of pHIT/G by using FuGENE6. After 48 h, the supernatants were harvested, and the amount of p24 antigen was measured by using an HIV-1 p24-antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Advanced BioScience Laboratories). 1.25 × 105 HeLa cells were transduced with 1 μg of a lentivirus carrying βTrCP-1 and/or βTrCP-2 shRNA. 1.75 × 105 293T cells were cotransfected with the proviral construct (0.5 μg) pNL-Luc-U−E− together with 25 ng of pCA-Vpu-RRE (WT or mutants), 25 ng of pCA-Rev, 2.5 ng of pCA-BST-2 (WT or mutants), and 947.5 ng of the empty vector by using FuGENE 6. After 48 h the supernatants were harvested and subjected to p24-antigen capture ELISA. To normalize transfection efficiency, cells were lysed in 75 μl of lysis buffer, and firefly luciferase activities were determined by using a firefly Luciferase Assay System (Promega) with a Centro LB960 luminometer (Berthold). Alternatively, 7 × 105 293T cells were cotransfected with the proviral construct (1 μg) pNL-E−, pNL-Vpu2/6-E−, or pNL-U−E− together with 0.1 μg of pHIT/G and 0.9 μg of the empty vector by using FuGENE 6. After 48 h the supernatants were harvested and subjected to p24-antigen capture ELISA. βTrCP-1 and/or βTrCP-2-knockdown HeLa cells seeded at 6.25 × 104 cells were infected with 12.5 ng each of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped HIV-1. Sixteen hours later cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 1 ml of fresh complete medium was added. After 24 h supernatants were harvested and subjected to HIV-1 p24-antigen capture ELISA. 7 × 105 293T cells were cotransfected with 0.4 μg of pCA-Rev, either 0.8 μg of pCA-Vpu-RRE or pCA-Vpu-HA-RRE (WT or mutants), and either 0.8 μg of pCA-BST-2 (WT, or mutants) or pCA-BST-2-exMyc using FuGENE 6. Alternatively, 0.5 μg of βTrCP-1 or-2 plasmid was added to 0.5 μg each of the plasmids as described above (in control experiments, 0.5 μg of pCA-CD4 was used instead of pCA-BST-2). At 48 h after transfection, the cells were suspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% digitonin, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The resultant lysates were clarified by brief centrifugation, precleared with 30 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C, incubated with the anti-BST-2 mouse polyclonal antibody the Vpu antiserum, an anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Sigma) or an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C, and then added to 30 μl of protein G-agarose beads. After 1 h at 4 °C, the immune complexes were extensively washed with lysis buffer, and equal aliquots of the total and bound fractions were subjected to gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were probed with the anti-BST-2 mouse polyclonal antibody, the Vpu antiserum, an anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma), or an anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma). 1.75 × 105 293T cells were cotransfected with 2.5 ng of either the control vector or extracellular FLAG-tagged series of BST-2 expression plasmids, 25 ng of pCA-Vpu-RRE, 25 ng of pCA-Rev, 50 ng of pCA-EGFP (in some experiments together with 25 ng of the dynamin-2 WT or mutant expression plasmid) and the empty vector up to 1 μg of total DNA. After 48 h, transfected cells were incubated with an anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or an isotype control antibody (Immunotech) followed by staining with a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to R-phycoeythrin (Molecular Probes) for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting on a CyFlow (Partec). The data were analyzed by using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). COS7 cells were plated on 13-mmΦ glass coverslips, cotransfected with the indicated plasmids, and cultured for 24 h before fixation. To evaluate the Vpu-induced down-regulation of BST-2, cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of pCA-Vpu-EGFP-RRE (WT or CD4tm chimera), 0.5 μg of pCA-Rev, and 50 ng of Myc-tagged BST-2 (WT or mutants) using FuGENE 6. Alternatively, cells were cotransfected with 0.3 μg of pCA-Vpu-HA-RRE (WT or CD4tm chimera), 0.3 μg of pCA-Rev, 50 ng of pCA-BST-2-exMyc together with 0.4 μg of either pCA-Dyn2-EGFP or pCA-Dyn2-K44A-EGFP. To detect Myc-tagged BST-2 accumulated in lysosomes, the transfected cells were cultured for 16 h in complete medium in the presence of lysosomal protease inhibitors (40 μm of leupeptin and pepstatin A; Peptide Institute Inc., 4 μg/ml E64d; Sigma). To evaluate the involvement of proteasomal degradation in the Vpu-induced down-regulation of BST-2, transfected cells were cultured for 12 h in complete medium in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor (0.8 μm of MG-132; Sigma). The transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.05% saponin for 10 min, and immunostained with an anti-cathepsin D polyclonal antibody (DAKO) and an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10; Sigma). To distinguish cell-surface and intracellular BST-2 proteins, cells were incubated in complete medium in the presence of the anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody at 4 °C for 5 min, washed in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin for 10 min and immunostained with the anti-Myc polyclonal antibody. Secondary goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies that had been conjugated with Cy3 or Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) were used at 5 μg/ml. DNA staining with Hoechst (Molecular Probes) was performed at 0.5 μg/ml. All immunofluorescence images were observed on a Leica DMRB microscope (Wetzlar) equipped with a 100× 1.32 NA oil immersion lens (PL APO), acquired through a cooled CCD camera, MicroMAX (Princeton Instruments), and digitally processed using IPlab Software (Scanalytics). We first investigated the possible interaction between Vpu and BST-2. Precleared cell lysates from 293T cells cotransfected with Vpu and BST-2 expression plasmids were incubated with the anti-BST-2 antibody, and the resulting complexes were analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody to Vpu. An antibody against BST-2 was able to specifically coimmunoprecipitate Vpu protein from 293T cells (Fig. 1A, left panel). In the converse experiment cell lysates from 293T cells expressing Vpu and BST-2 proteins were incubated with the anti-Vpu antibody, and the precipitates were analyzed using the anti-BST-2 antibody. BST-2 protein was also able to be coimmunoprecipitated with Vpu (Fig. 1A, right panel). We, therefore, conclude that Vpu and BST-2 can physically interact. To dissect the mechanisms by which Vpu counteracts BST-2 protein, we examined the cell-surface expression of BST-2 in the presence and absence of Vpu by flow cytometry using optimal doses of BST-2 and Vpu expression plasmids based on levels of endogenous expression in HeLa cells and of physiological expression from Vpu-positive NL4-3 proviral DNA, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Cell-surface expression of BST-2 in 293T cells transfected with the expression plasmid encoding BST-2 was readily detected by using the anti-BST-2 antibody. When Vpu was coexpressed with BST-2 in 293T cells, expression of BST-2 on the cell surface was remarkably diminished (Fig. 1B), as recently reported (30.Van Damme N. Goff D. Katsura C. Jorgenson R.L. Mitchell R. Johnson M.C. Stephens E.B. Guatelli J. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 3: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). BST-2-specific cell-surface and intracellular immunofluorescence staining confirmed that Vpu was able to block cell-surface expression of BST-2 (Fig. 1C, lower panels), although a control Vpu-CD4TM hybrid protein, which is unable to enhance virion release (44.Paul M. Mazumder S. Raja N. Jabbar M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not affect BST-2 expression (Fig. 1C, upper panels). These results suggest that Vpu down-regulates cell-surface BST-2, thereby probably leading to the lysosomal degradation of this host protein. Alternatively, Vpu might prevent de novo BST-2 expression intracellularly by inducing proteasomal degradation, similar to the mechanism by which it acts on CD4 (10.Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H.

Telenti A. Rothenberger S. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 1502-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or by inducing lysosomal degradation before BST-2 reaches the plasma membrane. We next attempted to determine the pathway of the Vpu-induced down-regulation of BST-2. To examine whether BST-2 undergoes lysosomal degradation, we transfected COS7 cells with Myc-tagged BST-2 expression plasmid and either the WT Vpu or CD4tmVpu expression plasmid in the presence or absence of a mixture of lysosomal protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin A, and E64d (45.Volanti C.

In bone, periostin is preferentially expressed in the periosteum, but its functional significance remains unclear. We investigated Postn−/− mice and their wild type littermates to elucidate the role of periostin in the skeletal response to moderate physical activity and direct axial compression of the tibia. Furthermore, we administered a sclerostin-blocking antibody to these mice in order to demonstrate the influence of sustained Sost expression in their altered bone phenotypes. Cancellous and cortical bone microarchitecture as well as bending strength were altered in Postn−/− compared with Postn+/+ mice. Exercise and axial compression both significantly increased bone mineral density and trabecular and cortical microarchitecture as well as biomechanical properties of the long bones in Postn+/+ mice by increasing the bone formation activity, particularly at the periosteum. These changes correlated with an increase of periostin expression and a consecutive decrease of Sost in the stimulated bones. In contrast, mechanical stimuli had no effect on the skeletal properties of Postn−/− mice, where base-line expression of Sost levels were higher than Postn+/+ and remained unchanged following axial compression. In turn, the concomitant injection of sclerostin-blocking antibody rescued the bone biomechanical response in Postn−/− mice. Taken together, these results indicate that the matricellular periostin protein is required for Sost inhibition and thereby plays an important role in the determination of bone mass and microstructural in response to loading.

Taken together, these results indicate that the matricellular periostin protein is required for Sost inhibition and thereby plays an important role in the determination of bone mass and microstructural in response to loading. Periostin gene (Postn) expression was first identified using subtractive hybridization techniques on MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells and initially named osteoblast-specific factor 2 (OSF-2) (1.Takeshita S. Kikuno R. Tezuka K. Amann E. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Subsequently, several developmentally regulated and differentially spliced isoforms of Postn have been identified in both mice and humans and are expressed in many non-skeletal tissues, including stromal cells from ovary, breast, colon, and brain tumors. Periostin is a 90-kDa secreted extracellular matrix protein that binds integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5, thereby regulating cell adhesion and mobility (2.Gillan L. Matei D. Fishman D.A. Gerbin C.S. Karlan B.Y. Chang D.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5358-5364PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Shimazaki M. Nakamura K. Kii I. Kashima T. Amizuka N. Li M. Saito M. Fukuda K. Nishiyama T. Kitajima S. Saga Y.

Periostin potently promotes metastatic growth of colon cancer cells by augmenting their survival via the Akt/protein kinase B pathway (4.Bao S. Ouyang G. Bai X. Huang Z. Ma C. Liu M. Shao R.

Besides, periostin is predominantly expressed in tissues subject to mechanical stress, suggesting a potential function of periostin in maintaining the structure and integrity of connective tissues. For example, periostin is expressed by cardiac fibroblasts (5.Katsuragi N. Morishita R. Nakamura N. Ochiai T. Taniyama Y. Hasegawa Y. Kawashima K. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Sugimura K.

Periostin is also linked to type I collagen in the periodontal ligament, where it regulates fibrillogenesis and consequently the biomechanical properties of fibrous connective tissues around the tooth (9.Norris R.A. Damon B. Mironov V. Kasyanov V. Ramamurthi A. Moreno-Rodriguez R. Trusk T. Potts J.D. Goodwin R.L. Davis J. Hoffman S. Wen X. Sugi Y. Kern C.B. Mjaatvedt C.H. Turner D.K. Oka T. Conway S.J.

Periodontol. 2008; 79: 1480-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro application of tensional forces to periodontal cells increases Postn expression. In contrast, following in vivo masticatory unloading, Postn mRNA levels decrease (11.Rios H.F. Ma D. Xie Y. Giannobile W.V. Bonewald L.F. Conway S.J. Feng J.Q. J.

Postn-deficient mice (Postn−/−) show severe alterations in tooth (incisor) eruption, resulting from a failure to digest collagen fibers in the shear zone of the periodontal ligament (13.Rios H. Koushik S.V. Wang H. Wang J. Zhou H.M. Lindsley A. Rogers R. Chen Z. Maeda M. Kruzynska-Frejtag A. Feng J.Q. Conway S.J. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 2006; 342: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the enamel and dentin of the incisors is compressed and disorganized. In MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells, periostin is secreted into the collagen matrix and regulates cell adhesion and differentiation (15.Horiuchi K. Amizuka N. Takeshita S. Takamatsu H. Katsuura M. Ozawa H. Toyama Y. Bonewald L.F. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 16.Litvin J. Selim A.H. Montgomery M.O. Lehmann K. Rico M.C. Devlin H. Bednarik D.P. Safadi F.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 1044-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Postn using specific periostin-blocking antibodies leads to a severe reduction of osteoblast-specific differentiation markers, such as type I collagen, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and alkaline phosphatase (16.Litvin J. Selim A.H. Montgomery M.O. Lehmann K. Rico M.C. Devlin H. Bednarik D.P. Safadi F.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 1044-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the rodent adult skeleton, Postn expression appears to be restricted to the periosteum, without any reported expression within the endosteum (15.Horiuchi K. Amizuka N. Takeshita S. Takamatsu H. Katsuura M. Ozawa H. Toyama Y. Bonewald L.F. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). For this reason, Postn has recently been used to identify periosteal osteoblasts ex vivo (17.Ogita M. Rached M.T. Dworakowski E. Bilezikian J.P. Kousteni S. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 5713-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). During fracture repair, Postn mRNA is up-regulated 2-fold and localizes to preosteoblastic cells within the periosteum as well as in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells close to the fracture site (18.Nakazawa T. Nakajima A. Seki N. Okawa A. Kato M. Moriya H. Amizuka N. Einhorn T.A. Yamazaki M. J. Orthop. Res. 2004; 22: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Postn−/− mice have shorter long bones, suggesting a disruption of the cartilaginous growth plate (13.Rios H. Koushik S.V. Wang H. Wang J. Zhou H.M. Lindsley A. Rogers R. Chen Z. Maeda M. Kruzynska-Frejtag A. Feng J.Q. Conway S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 11131-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Whether periostin influences bone turnover, however, remains to be elucidated. In young and adult rats, treadmill exercise, typically 1 h/day, is known to increase cortical and cancellous bone mass of the tibia due to enhanced bone formation and reduced bone resorption (19.Iwamoto J. Takeda T. Ichimura S. J. Orthop. Sci. 1998; 3: 257-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20.Iwamoto J. Yeh J.K. Aloia J.F.

Physiol. 2007; 103: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cyclic axial compression of the ulna or tibia can also increase bone mass and size in rodents (22.Robling A.G. Burr D.B. Turner C.H. J Musculoskelet. Neuronal Interact. 2001; 1: 249-262PubMed Google Scholar). In these models, stimulation of bone formation occurs mainly at the periosteal rather than endocortical surfaces (23.Lee K.C. Maxwell A. Lanyon L.E. Bone. 2002; 31: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 24.de Souza R.L. Pitsillides A.A. Lanyon L.E. Skerry T.M. Chenu C. J.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This bone (re)modeling effect largely depends on the suppression of sclerostin gene (Sost) expression by osteocytes (26.Robling A.G. Niziolek P.J. Baldridge L.A. Condon K.W. Allen M.R. Alam I. Mantila S.M. Gluhak-Heinrich J. Bellido T.M. Harris S.E. Turner C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar), which then allows for the stimulation of Wnt/LRP5/β-catenin signaling within lining osteoblasts (27.Sawakami K. Robling A.G. Ai M. Pitner N.D. Liu D. Warden S.J. Li J. Maye P. Rowe D.W. Duncan R.L. Warman M.L. Turner C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23698-23711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Interestingly, preliminary studies suggest that sclerostin antagonistic activity on Wnt signaling can be inhibited by periostin (28.Huang, Q. Y., (2008) International Bone and Mineral Workshops, Davos, Switzerland March 9–11, 2009Google Scholar). These observations led us to hypothesize that periostin modulates bone turnover, specifically in response to mechanical stimulation. In order to test this hypothesis, we characterized bone mass, microarchitecture, and strength in Postn−/− mice. We show that Postn mRNA and protein expression in bone is stimulated by mechanical loading, which precedes inhibition of Sost gene expression. Furthermore, we report that periostin is required for the complete biomechanical responses of the skeleton to both axial compression and physical activity and that sclerostin-blocking antibodies restore the bone biomechanical response in Postn−/− mice. Postn−LacZ knock-in mice (Postn−/−) were generated as reported previously (13.Rios H. Koushik S.V. Wang H. Wang J. Zhou H.M. Lindsley A. Rogers R. Chen Z. Maeda M. Kruzynska-Frejtag A. Feng J.Q. Conway S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 11131-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Postn−/− mice were subsequently bred with C57BL/6J mice, and tail DNA analyzed by PCR was used to identify Postn heterozygous mice. We interbred mice that were heterozygous carriers of this mutation and obtained wild-type (Postn+/+), heterozygous (Postn+/−), and homozygous mutant (Postn−/−) offspring in the expected Mendelian genetic frequencies. These mice were subsequently back-crossed for 6 generations, resulting in a genome of 98% C57BL/6J. Mice were housed five per cage, maintained under standard non-barrier conditions, and had access to water and soft diet ad libitum (2019 Teklad, Harlan Laboratories, Shardlow, UK). A soft diet was chosen to reduce malnutrition in the Postn−/− mice, which was previously observed under a standard diet due to the enamel and dentin defects of the incisors and molars (13.Rios H. Koushik S.V. Wang H. Wang J. Zhou H.M. Lindsley A. Rogers R. Chen Z. Maeda M. Kruzynska-Frejtag A. Feng J.Q. Conway S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 11131-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). All of the mice received the same diet throughout the experiment. 12- and 14 week-old male mice were used for the treadmill exercise and the loading studies, respectively. An additional group of mice were sacrificed at 12 weeks old to describe the bone phenotype of the Postn-deficient mice at base line (n = 10 mice/group). Animal procedures were approved by the University of Geneva School of Medicine Ethical Committee and the State of Geneva Veterinarian Office. The loading apparatus was specifically adapted for mouse tibiae as previously described (29.Stadelmann V.A. Hocke J. Verhelle J. Forster V. Merlini F. Terrier A. Pioletti D.P. Comput. Methods Biomech. Biomed. Engin. 2008; 12: 95-100Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Custom molded pads were placed on the axes to apply compression on the bone extremities. The tibiae were then placed on the stimulation machine between the moving pad on the proximal side (the knee) and the fixed pad on the distal side (the foot). Strain magnitudes were calibrated ex vivo using miniature strain gauges bound to the midshaft tibia surface, as previously reported (24.de Souza R.L. Pitsillides A.A. Lanyon L.E. Skerry T.M. Chenu C. J. Bone Miner Res. 2005; 20: 2159-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29.Stadelmann V.A. Hocke J. Verhelle J. Forster V. Merlini F. Terrier A. Pioletti D.P. Comput. Methods Biomech. Biomed. Engin. 2008; 12: 95-100Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The left tibia of each mouse was subjected to dynamic axial stimulation, using the following parameters: peak load = 12 newtons; peak strain (midshaft cortex) = 1500 micro strain; pulse period (trapeze-shaped pulse) = 0.1 s; rest time between pulses = 10 s; full cycle frequency (pulse + rest) = 0.1 Hz. A total of 40 cycles (∼7 min) were applied per day. The non-stimulated right tibia served as an internal control. The mice used to study the bone response to direct axial compression were stimulated on 3 alternate days/week for 2 weeks and sacrificed 3 days later. To measure dynamic indices of bone formation, mice received subcutaneous injections of calcein (25 mg/kg; Sigma) 9 and 2 days before euthanasia. The mice used for immunohistochemical staining of periostin were stimulated for 2 consecutive days and then sacrificed on day 3. The mice used for real-time analyses were stimulated for a single session (1 day) and sacrificed 6 or 24 h later. For the axial compression procedure, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamin xylasine. The total duration of anesthesia lasted just a bit longer than the loading period, up to a maximum of 20 min. None of the mice showed signs of lameness or decreased activity levels after recovery from anesthesia (n = 10 mice/group). This loading experiment was repeated in Postn+/+ and Postn−/− mice with concomitant intravenous injection of a sclerostin-blocking antibody (Sost-Ab 2The abbreviations used are: Sost-Absclerostin-blocking antibodyAbantibodyANOVAanalysis of variance1F-ANOVAone-factor ANOVA2F-ANOVAtwo-factor ANOVABMDbone mineral densitymicroCTmicrocomputed tomographyNnewtonPLSDprotected least squares differenceBVbone volumeTVtotal volumeTbTHtrabecular thicknessTbNtrabecular numberTbtrabecularConn densityconnectivity densitySMIstructural model indexCtTVcortical tissue volumeCtBVcortical tissue bone volumeBMaVbone marrow volumeCtThaverage cortical widthMARmineral apposition rateSLSsingle-labeled surfaceBSbone surfacedLSdouble-labeled surfaceMSmineralizing surfaceBFRbone formation rateTbSpseparation between trabeculaeMPmmineralization perimeterBPmbone perimeter. ; 12 mg/kg/week) or a control antibody (anti-cyclosporin A, Ig-G2A) for 2 weeks (n = 6 mice/group/genotype). The anti-sclerostin antibody was isolated from a combinatorial antibody library using phage display technology (MorphoSys AG, Martinsried, Germany) and administered 1 h prior to axial compression at a concentration previously found to have mild anabolic effects on bone (30.Li X.

Nine mice were sacrificed at the age of 14 weeks, and the tibiae were immediately excised. Soft tissues were removed, and the tibia were cleaned with acetone. The tibiae were separated randomly into three groups of six corresponding to three zones of tests on the tibia: zone 1, anteroproximal; zone 2, anterotibial crest; zone 3, posterodistal. Each tibia received a single element foil strain gauge (EA-06-015LA-120, Vishay Micro-measurements, Raleigh, NC) aligned with the long axis bound to bone surface with cyanoacrylate. The gauge was connected to a tension amplifier and digital recorder (DAQ NI9215, National Instruments, Switzerland). Gauge location allowed for the analysis of the whole strain submitted to the bone during an axial compression of the tibia without any space left between the gauges. Male mice (12 weeks old) were randomly divided into exercise-trained and rested groups for each genotype, Postn−/−, Postn+/−, and Postn+/+ mice. The mice were trained 5 days/week for 6 weeks. During the first week, the treadmill speed and the duration of each running session were gradually increased from 8 m/min for 10 min to 16 m/min for 40 min. For the last 5 weeks, the running sessions consisted of 16 m/min for 40 min with a treadmill inclination of 8°, corresponding to moderate exercise for these mice at this specific age (31.Narkar V.A. Downes M. Yu R.T. Embler E. Wang Y.X. Banayo E. Mihaylova M.M. Nelson M.C. Zou Y. Juguilon H. Kang H. Shaw R.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 2008; 134: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Rested mice serving as control were handled twice daily at 1-h intervals to mimic the stress induced by handling before and after running. It should be noted that the above interventions do not affect food intake in mice (data not shown). At the end of the study (i.e. at 18 weeks of age), all mice were sacrificed with an overdose of ketamin xylasine (n = 8 mice/group). To measure dynamic indices of bone formation, mice received subcutaneous injections of calcein 9 and 2 days before euthanasia. Total body, femoral, and spinal bone mineral density (BMD; g/cm2) were measured in vivo, at 12 and 18 weeks of age in the exercise experiment and at 13 and 16 weeks of age in the axial compression experiment, by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (PIXImus2, GE lunar, Madison, WI) (32.Iida-Klein A. Lu S.S. Yokoyama K. Dempster D.W. Nieves J.W. Lindsay R. J. Clin. Densitom. 2003; 6: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A high resolution in vivo microcomputed tomography system (microCT Skyscan 1076, Skyscan, Aartselaar, Belgium) was used to scan the left and right tibiae. The in vivo microCT system consists of an x-ray source and detector that rotates around the animal bed. The machine is equipped with a 100-kV x-ray source with a spot size of 5 μm. Each scan lasted ∼20 min, resulting in shadow projections with a pixel size of 10 μm. A modified Feldkamp algorithm, using undersampling to reduce noise, was applied to the scan data, resulting in reconstructed three-dimensional data sets with a voxel size of 20 μm. (33.Waarsing J.H. Day J.S. van der Linden J.C. Ederveen A.G. Spanjers C. De Clerck N. Sasov A. Verhaar J.A. Weinans H. Bone. 2004; 34: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The mice were scanned at 14 weeks of age before loading and at 16 weeks of age, 3 days after the last loading. A detailed description and validation of the algorithm is published elsewhere (34.Waarsing, J. H., Day, J. S., Weinans, H., (2002) The IXth Congress of the International Society of Bone Morphometry, Edingburgh, UK, April, 2002Google Scholar). Cortical and trabecular bones were separated manually with “CT Analyzer” software (Skyscan, Aartselaar, Belgium). For a description of the bone microarchitecture parameters analyzed, see below. Microcomputed tomography (microCT UCT40, Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) was used to assess trabecular bone volume fraction and microarchitecture in the excised 5th lumber spine body and distal femur and cortical bone geometry at the midshaft femoral diaphysis as described previously (35.Bouxsein M.L. Pierroz D.D. Glatt V. Goddard D.S. Cavat F. Rizzoli R. Ferrari S.L. J. Bone Miner Res. 2005; 20: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, trabecular and cortical bone regions were evaluated using isotropic 12-μm voxels. For the vertebral trabecular region, we evaluated 250 transverse CT slices between the cranial and caudal end plates, excluding 100 μm near each end plate. For the femoral and tibial trabecular region, to eliminate the primary spongious, we analyzed 100 slices from the 50 slices under the distal growth plate. Femoral cortical geometry was assessed using 50 continuous CT slides (600 μm) located at the femoral midshaft. Images were segmented using an adaptative-iterative thresholding approach rather than a fixed threshold. Morphometric variables were computed from binarized images using direct, three-dimensional techniques that do not rely on prior assumptions about the underlying structure (36.Hildebrand T. Ruegsegger P. J. Microsc. 1997; 185: 67-75Crossref Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). For the trabecular bone regions, we assessed the bone volume fraction (BV/TV, percentage), trabecular thickness (TbTh, μm), trabecular number (TbN, mm−1), trabecular connectivity density (Tb Conn density, mm−3), and structural model index (SMI). The structure model index was measured to determine the prevalence of platelike or rodlike trabecular structures, where 0 represents “plates” and 3 represents “rods” (36.Hildebrand T. Ruegsegger P. J. Microsc. 1997; 185: 67-75Crossref Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). For cortical bone at the femoral and tibial midshaft, we measured the cortical tissue volume (CtTV, mm3), bone volume (CtBV, mm3), marrow volume (BMaV, mm3), and average cortical width (CtTh, μm). The whole tibia was excised, and both tibial extremities were cut to remove the bone marrow from the diaphysis, by flushing with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Tibial diaphysis and extremities were immediately pulverized to a fine powder and homogenized in peqGold Trifast (peQLab Biotechnologie GmbH) using a FastPrep system apparatus (QBiogene) in order to achieve quantitative RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted and then purified on minicolumns (RNeasy minikit, Qiagen) in combination with a deoxyribonuclease treatment (RNase-free DNase set, Qiagen) to avoid DNA contamination. Single-stranded cDNA templates for quantitative real-time PCR analyses were carried out using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using predesigned TaqMan® gene expression assays (references as follows: B2m, Mm00437762_m1; Sost, Mm00470479_m1; Postn, Mm00450111_m1) (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) consisting of two unlabeled primers and a FAMTM dye-labeled TaqMan® MGB probe and the correspondent buffer TaqMan® universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). A Biomek 2000 robot (Beckman Coulter, Nyon, Switzerland) was used for liquid handling (10 μl) in 384-well plates with 3 replicates/sample. The cDNA was PCR-amplified in a 7900HT SDS System, and raw threshold cycle (Ct) values were obtained from SDS version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantities (RQ) were calculated with the formula RQ = E − Ct using an efficiency (E) of 2 by default. For each gene, the highest quantity was arbitrarily designated a value of 1.0. The mean quantity was calculated from triplicates for each sample, and this quantity was normalized to the similarly measured mean quantity of the β2-microglobulin normalization gene. Finally, normalized quantities were averaged for 3–4 animals and represented as mean ± S.E. The right and left tibiae were excised and subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. They were then decalcified in 19% EDTA and 4% phosphate-buffered formalin for 3 weeks. The tibiae were then dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol, cleared in Propar (Anatech LTD, Battle Creek, MI), and embedded in paraffin blocks. 10-μm-thick sections were cut from the blocks at the tibia midshaft level using a RM2155 microtome (Leica, Germany) and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher). Sections were air-dried overnight at room temperature. Prior to staining, they were incubated at 60 °C for 1 h, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in a descending series of ethanol. Deparaffinized slides were pretreated in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol to quench endogenous peroxidase and rinsed in tap water followed by nonspecific avidin/biotin blocking (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. All incubations took place in a humidified chamber. Additional protein blocking was accomplished with Protein Block-Serum Free (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Using the Vectastain Elite ABC (rabbit IgG) kit (Vector Laboratories), the slides were incubated in 1.5% normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. The primary antibody (rabbit anti-periostin) (Ed Krug, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC) was diluted in antibody diluent (DAKO) to a final concentration of 1:6000 and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The following day, slides were rinsed in Wash Buffer (DAKO) for 15 min on a rocker at room temperature and incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit (Vectastain kit) secondary antibody diluted 1:1000 for 30 min at room temperature, followed by another rinse in Wash Buffer for 15 min on a rocker at room temperature. The ABC reagent from the Vector kit was prepared according to the manufacturer's directions at a dilution of 1:250, and the slides were incubated in it for 30 min at room temperature and rinsed, as above, in Wash Buffer. All incubation steps were performed at room temperature, and all rinse steps employed the DAKO Wash Buffer at room temperature on a rocker. The following protocol was used: incubation in streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase diluted at 1:100 for 30 min and washed for 15 min. Slides were developed in a working solution of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB Substrate Kit for Peroxidase Kit, Vector Laboratories) prepared according to the manufacturer's directions for 10 min at room temperature. Following a final rinse in deionized water, the slides were counterstained in Weak Methyl Green and mounted in Cytoseal 60 (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). Positive periostin staining was quantified using a microscope interfaced with an image analysis system (Leica Corp.). To measure dynamic in"
https://openalex.org/W2115359460,"The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) and its G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) CXCR4 play fundamental roles in many physiological processes, and CXCR4 is a drug target for various diseases such as cancer metastasis and human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, infection. However, almost no structural information about the SDF-1-CXCR4 interaction is available, mainly because of the difficulties in expression, purification, and crystallization of CXCR4. In this study, an extensive investigation of the preparation of CXCR4 and optimization of the experimental conditions enables NMR analyses of the interaction between the full-length CXCR4 and SDF-1. We demonstrated that the binding of an extended surface on the SDF-1 beta-sheet, 50-s loop, and N-loop to the CXCR4 extracellular region and that of the SDF-1 N terminus to the CXCR4 transmembrane region, which is critical for G-protein signaling, take place independently by methyl-utilizing transferred cross-saturation experiments along with the usage of the CXCR4-selective antagonist AMD3100. Furthermore, based upon the data, we conclude that the highly dynamic SDF-1 N terminus in the 1st step bound state plays a crucial role in efficiently searching the deeply buried binding pocket in the CXCR4 transmembrane region by the ""fly-casting"" mechanism. This is the first structural analyses of the interaction between a full-length GPCR and its chemokine, and our methodology would be applicable to other GPCR-ligand systems, for which the structural studies are still challenging."

Protein modification by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors is a highly conserved posttranslational modification in eukaryotes (Ferguson et al., 2008Ferguson M.A. Kinoshita T. Hart G.W.

Approximately 150 proteins are modified by GPI, which is vital for embryonic development, immune responses, and neurogenesis in mammals. GPI biosynthesis and attachment to proteins are carried out on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Many genes involved in the GPI biosynthetic pathway have been characterized in mammalian cells, yeasts, and trypanosomes (Ferguson, 1999Ferguson M.A. The structure, biosynthesis and functions of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors, and the contributions of trypanosome research.J.

However, relatively little is known about how the modified proteins are targeted to their proper destinations. In the early secretory pathway, proteins including GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) are transported from the ER in vesicles formed by coat protein complex II (COPII). Most proteins are actively sorted and packaged into these vesicles (Belden and Barlowe, 2001bBelden W.J. Barlowe C.

Jiang F. Schekman R. Concentrative sorting of secretory cargo proteins into COPII-coated vesicles.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), although a bulk flow export mechanism also exists. GPI attachment to proteins is indispensable for their exit from the ER, otherwise most proteins are degraded by the proteasome through ER-associated degradation. GPI is an ER export signal in protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei (McDowell et al., 1998McDowell M.A. Ransom D.M. Bangs J.D. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-dependent secretory transport in Trypanosoma brucei.Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In yeasts, GPI-APs are sorted and transported from the ER via vesicles that are distinct from those containing other proteins such as the general amino acid permease Gap1p and pro-α factors (Muniz et al., 2001Muniz M. Morsomme P. Riezman H. Protein sorting upon exit from the endoplasmic reticulum.Cell. 2001; 104: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The p24 family proteins are putative cargo receptors recycling between the ER and the Golgi, and members of this family in yeast are required for efficient packaging of GPI-APs (Muniz et al., 2000Muniz M. Nuoffer C. Hauri H.P. Riezman H. The Emp24 complex recruits a specific cargo molecule into endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, Schimmoller et al., 1995Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Schroder S. Kruger U. Barlowe C. Riezman H.

In mammalian cells, efficient transport of GPI-APs also requires p24 family members (Takida et al., 2008Takida S. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mammalian GPI-anchored proteins require p24 proteins for their efficient transport from the ER to the plasma membrane.Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how the p24 family members are involved in the transport of GPI-APs, and which components and GPI structures actually determine the exit of GPI-APs from the ER (Kaiser, 2000Kaiser C. Thinking about p24 proteins and how transport vesicles select their cargo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 3783-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition to the early secretory pathways, GPI-APs have unique properties in other secretory and endocytic pathways. Many GPI-APs are transported to the apical side of the plasma membrane in several types of epithelial cells, and to the axonal regions of neuronal cells (Brown et al., 1989Brown D.A. Crise B.

GPI-anchored proteins are directly targeted to the apical surface in fully polarized MDCK cells.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that several GPI-APs are selectively internalized by a unique pathway involving dynamin-independent, Cdc42- and ARF1-regulated endocytic vesicles (Kumari and Mayor, 2008Kumari S. Mayor S. ARF1 is directly involved in dynamin-independent endocytosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, Sabharanjak et al., 2002Sabharanjak S. Sharma P.

Cell. 2002; 2: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The GPI anchor functions as a sorting signal for selective targeting of GPI-APs to this pathway. The sorting of GPI-APs to the secretory and endocytic pathways seems to be correlated with their associations with specialized lipid domains, designated lipid rafts or nanoclusters (Brown and Rose, 1992Brown D.A. Rose J.K.

Ikonen E. Functional rafts in cell membranes.Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7747) Google Scholar). Although there are no satisfactory definitions of these specialized lipid domains, certain lipids form membrane microdomains that function as platforms for intracellular signaling or are required for selective transport of proteins (Mayor and Riezman, 2004Mayor S. Riezman H. Sorting GPI-anchored proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). GPI is synthesized from phosphatidylinositol (PI) containing an unsaturated fatty acid at the sn-2 position, whereas GPI-APs have a saturated fatty acid at the sn-2 position in mammalian cells (Figure S1 available online). The lipid moieties of the GPI anchors are remodeled after GPI attachment to proteins, and this remodeling is critical for lipid raft association in mammalian cells as well as in yeasts (Bosson et al., 2006Bosson R. Jaquenoud M. Conzelmann A. GUP1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes an O-acyltransferase involved in remodeling of the GPI anchor.Mol. Biol.

Fatty acid remodeling of GPI-anchored proteins is required for their raft association.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Unlike other lipid membrane anchoring, such as acylation and prenylation, GPI bears a complex glycan portion between a protein and its lipid anchor. In contrast to the function of the GPI lipid moiety, the function of the glycan moiety is not well understood. There is a structural difference between the glycan moieties of GPI just before attachment to proteins in the ER and GPI-APs on the cell surface (Figure S1). In the GPI biosynthetic pathway, a side-chain ethanolamine-phosphate (EtNP) can be attached to the second Man (Man2) of the GPI intermediate by PIG-G/GPI7 and PIG-F, thereby generating the complete precursor H8 (Hirose et al., 1992Hirose S. Prince G.M. Sevlever D. Ravi L. Rosenberry T.L. Ueda E. Medof M.E. Characterization of putative glycoinositol phospholipid anchor precursors in mammalian cells. Localization of phosphoethanolamine.J.

GPI7 is the second partner of PIG-F and involved in modification of glycosylphosphatidylinositol.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9728-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, most GPI-APs on the cell surface do not contain this side-chain EtNP on Man2 of GPI (Ferguson et al., 2008Ferguson M.A. Kinoshita T. Hart G.W. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol Anchors.in: Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H. Stanley P. Bertozzi C.R. Hart G.W. Etzler M.E. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2008: 143-161Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been considered that the GPI structure H7, which lacks a side-chain EtNP on Man2, may be the major precursor for protein attachment, and that H8 is a structural variant of H7 with a similar function. In the present study, we screened mutants defective in GPI-AP transport and identified a gene required for processing of the glycan moiety on GPI. First, chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant cell lines defective in transport of GPI-APs were established. The mutant cells exhibited severe transport delay of GPI-APs from the ER to the Golgi. GPI-APs on the cell surface retained a side-chain EtNP on Man2 of the GPI glycan in the mutant cells, whereas this side chain was mostly removed in wild-type (WT) cells. We identified the gene responsible for the defect of the mutant cells and designated it PGAP5 (post-GPI attachment to proteins 5). PGAP5 was a phosphoesterase directly required for removal of a side-chain EtNP from Man2 of GPI to allow efficient exit of GPI-APs from the ER. Our results suggest that remodeling of the GPI glycan regulates the transport of GPI-APs from the ER to the Golgi. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the physiological importance of the glycan portion of GPI anchors. To establish mutant cells defective in GPI-AP transport, FF8 was used as a parental cell line (Maeda et al., 2008Maeda Y. Ide T. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Kinoshita T. GPHR is a novel anion channel critical for acidification and functions of the Golgi apparatus.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1135-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the FF8 cell line, expression of a Flag-tagged temperature-sensitive reporter protein, VSVGex-Flag-GFP-GPI (VFG-GPI), was induced by adding doxycycline at the nonpermissive temperature of 40°C, thereby causing accumulation in the ER of VFG-GPI, which could then be released from the ER all at once by shifting the temperature to 32°C (Figure S2). Transport of VFG-GPI to the plasma membrane was monitored by flow cytometry of the surface expression of the Flag-tag at various times after the temperature shift. FF8 cells were mutagenized with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and several rounds of similar transport assays were performed to sort out the mutant cells displaying delayed transport of VFG-GPI. Mutant clones 9 (C9) and 19 (C19) cells were finally obtained (Figure 1A). C9 and C19 mutant cells exhibited defective transport of the reporter protein (Figures 1B and 1C; data for C9 not shown). Transport of a transmembrane protein, Flag-VSVGfull-GFP (FVG-TM), to the cell surface was barely affected in these mutant cells (Figures 1D and 1E), indicating that GPI-AP transport was selectively delayed in these mutant cells. We investigated whether the mutant cells were defective in genes known to be involved in GPI biosynthesis and remodeling. Steady-state surface expression of GPI-APs and GPI biosynthesis were normal (Figures S3A and S3B). We also confirmed the normal PI-phospholipase C (PLC) sensitivity of GPI-APs (Figure S3C), indicating that the mutant cells were not defective in the GPI-inositol deacylase PGAP1 (Tanaka et al., 2004Tanaka S. Maeda Y. Tashima Y. Kinoshita T. Inositol deacylation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins is mediated by mammalian PGAP1 and yeast Bst1p.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14256-14263Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The fatty acid remodeling of GPI-APs, which is essential for the association of GPI-APs with lipid rafts (Maeda et al., 2007Maeda Y. Tashima Y. Houjou T. Fujita M. Yoko-o T. Jigami Y. Taguchi R. Kinoshita T. Fatty acid remodeling of GPI-anchored proteins is required for their raft association.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), was also normal as assessed by association of GPI-APs with detergent-resistant membranes (Figure S3D). These results indicate that the mutant cells do not have a defect in the biosynthesis and lipid remodeling of GPI. Next, we analyzed decay-accelerating factor (DAF), a GPI-AP, in the mutant cells to determine whether the mutant cells exhibit defective transport from the ER to the Golgi. Western blotting analysis of steady-state levels of ER and mature forms of DAF showed that in WT cells, the ER form (∼45 kDa) was smoothly transported to the Golgi where it accepted O-glycans and modification of the N-glycan to become the mature form (70–75 kDa), but that the ER form accumulated in the mutant cells (Figure 2A). Pulse-chase analyses revealed that transport of DAF from the ER to the Golgi was severely delayed in the mutant cells (Figures 2B and 2C), whereas the ER-to-Golgi transport of VSVG was normal (Figures S4A and S4B). We further tested GPI-AP-specific transport delay in C19 mutant cells using VFG-GPI. Due to the presence of a furin-cleavage site between VSVG and Flag-GFP parts, the reporter protein becomes smaller in size after arrival at the trans-Golgi network. As expected, conversion of the reporter protein from the 85 kDa form to the 30 kDa form was severely delayed in the mutant cells (Figures 2D and 2E). Taken together, these results indcate that the mutant cells were selectively impaired in the transport of GPI-APs from the ER to the Golgi. The gene responsible for the defective transport in C19 cells was identified by expression cloning based on restored protein transport. A retrovirus cDNA library prepared from human brain was used for the expression cloning. The identified gene, designated PGAP5, was previously recorded as metallophosphoesterase 1 (MPPE1; gene accession number NM_023075 for Homo sapiens), but its function was unknown. Human PGAP5 encodes a membrane protein bearing a phosphoesterase motif on the lumenal side and an ER retrieval signal at the C terminus. Transfection of human and mouse PGAP5 cDNAs restored the delayed transport of GPI-APs in both C9 and C19 mutant cells (Figures 3A and S5A). Accumulation of the ER form of DAF was also diminished by transfection of human PGAP5 (Figure S5B). To confirm that PGAP5 was the primary defect in these mutant cells, we identified the hamster PGAP5 gene, analyzed its cDNA from the C9 and C19 mutant cells, and found that 75 bases between positions 480 and 554 from the start codon were deleted in both mutant cells (Figures S6 and S7A–S7C). The region deleted in the mutant cells corresponds to exon 6 in the human and mouse PGAP5 (NM_023075 for H. sapiens and NM_172630 for Mus musculus), suggesting that the mutant cells have a defect in the exon-intron boundary of exon 6. We analyzed the genomic PGAP5 and revealed a GA transition at the donor splice site of intron 6 (gtgagt to gtgaat), which is known to cause skipping of exon (Tavassoli et al., 1997Tavassoli K. Eigel A. Pollmann H. Horst J. Mutational analysis of ectopic factor VIII transcripts from hemophilia A patients: identification of cryptic splice site, exon skipping and novel point mutations.Hum. Genet. 1997; 100: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), in C19 mutant cells (Figures S7D and S7E). When the hamster PGAP5 cDNAs were transfected into C19 cells, WT cDNA, but not the mutant cDNA, restored the delayed transport of GPI-APs (data not shown). Therefore, the defect in PGAP5 is the primary cause for the phenotypes of the mutant cells. We next examined the cellular localizations of PGAP5 in CHO and normal rat kidney (NRK) cells. HA-tagged PGAP5 (HA-hPGAP5), which fully restored the mutant phenotypes (Figure 3A), was constructed to investigate the localization. HA-hPGAP5 signals were detected strongly in the perinuclear area and as dot-like structures more dispersedly (Figure 3B, left panels). Signals of HA-hPGAP5 were not colocalized with those of the ER marker calnexin (CNX) (top panels). The signals in the perinuclear area merged with those of the Golgi marker GPP130 (bottom panels), whereas the majority of dot-like signals of HA-hPGAP5 were colocalized with ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)-53 and β-COP (third and fourth sets of panels from top, respectively). Some of the dot-like signals were colocalized with the ER-exit site marker Sec16 (second set of panels from top). ERGIC-53 and β-COP are localized at the ERGIC and cis-Golgi (Klumperman et al., 1998Klumperman J. Schweizer A. Clausen H. Tang B.L. Hong W. Oorschot V. Hauri H.P. The recycling pathway of protein ERGIC-53 and dynamics of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment.J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3411-3425PubMed Google Scholar). To strengthen the point that PGAP5 is in the ERGIC, we incubated cells in 5 μg/ml of brefeldin A to relocalize Golgi, but not ERGIC, proteins to the ER (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Microtubule-dependent retrograde transport of proteins into the ER in the presence of brefeldin A suggests an ER recycling pathway.Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, dot-like PGAP5-expressing structures remained, supporting the ERGIC localization of PGAP5 (Figure 3C). Therefore, HA-hPGAP5 is distributed in the ER-exit site, ERGIC, and cis-Golgi, although it should be noted that HA-hPGAP5 may be expressed higher than endogenous PGAP5 and had wider distribution than that of endogenous PGAP5. The ER retrieval signal KxKxx at the C terminus is conserved among PGAP5 homologs from fish to primates except for rodents (Figure S6). To check whether the ER retrieval signal is functional, the two Lys residues of the signal were replaced with Ala (K2A). The K2A protein localization at the dot-like structures was diminished (Figure 3D), suggesting that the C-terminal KxKxx motif functions as an ER retrieval signal and that PGAP5 recycles between the ER and the Golgi. The ability of K2A PGAP5 in restoring transport in C19 mutant cells was severely diminished as expected (Figure S8). Since the transport of GPI-APs was specifically delayed in the PGAP5 mutant cells, we analyzed whether PGAP5 is associated with GPI-APs. To confirm the association of PGAP5 with GPI-APs, immunoprecipitation of HA-hPGAP5 was performed. As a control, HA-tagged aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) encoding an ER protein was used (Figure 4A). We also included H158A, an active site mutant of PGAP5 to see whether the active site is important for association. VFG-GPI was weakly, but specifically, coprecipitated with PGAP5 (Figure 4A, third panel from top). Surprisingly, PGAP5 was also bound to p23 (fourth panel from top). The p24 family members, including p23, are known to be required for efficient transport of GPI-APs from the ER in both yeasts and mammalian cells (Schimmoller et al., 1995Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Schroder S. Kruger U. Barlowe C. Riezman H. The absence of Emp24p, a component of ER-derived COPII-coated vesicles, causes a defect in transport of selected proteins to the Golgi.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, Takida et al., 2008Takida S. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mammalian GPI-anchored proteins require p24 proteins for their efficient transport from the ER to the plasma membrane.Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the transmembrane proteins ERGIC-53 and GPP130 were not coprecipitated with PGAP5 (bottom two panels). To examine whether the association of PGAP5 with VFG-GPI depends on the GPI anchor, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with a construct that was similar but involved the transmembrane protein FVG-TM. The C19 mutant cells shown in Figure 4A were transiently transfected with FVG-TM and an immunoprecipitation analysis was performed similarly. FVG-TM was not coprecipitated with PGAP5 (Figure S9), suggesting that PGAP5 is associated with VFG-GPI via the GPI portion. Because PGAP5 partly exists in the ER-exit site (Figure 3B) and is associated with GPI-APs (Figure 4A) and because a defect in PGAP5 caused delayed ER-to-Golgi transport of GPI-APs (Figure 2), we next analyzed localization of GPI-APs (EGFP-F-CD59, a fusion protein of EGFP and CD59) in WT, C19, and HA-PGAP5-carrying C19 cells. Whereas WT and HA-PGAP5-carrying C19 cells had strong cell-surface expression of EGFP-F-CD59, C19 cells showed the ER expression of EGFP-F-CD59 in addition to the cell surface (Figure 4B). The expression pattern of EGFP-F-CD59 in C19 cells was nicely overlapped with that of the ER marker mRFP-KDEL (Figure 4C). The expression pattern of EGFP-F-CD59, however, was not coincided with that of the ER-exit site marker Sec13. The red dots representing mStrawberry-labeled Sec13 (Nagaya et al., 2008Nagaya H. Tamura T. Higa-Nishiyama A. Ohashi K. Takeuchi M. Hashimoto H. Hatsuzawa K. Kinjo M. Okada T. Wada I. Regulated motion of glycoproteins revealed by direct visualization of a single cargo in the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 129-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were mainly seen in the areas where the green color of EGFP-F-CD59 was dull (Figure 4D). It is, therefore, suggested that GPI-AP is not accumulated in the ER-exit site but rather that GPI-AP is not found clearly in the ER-exit site in the absence of PGAP5. To confirm that GPI-AP is not accumulated in the ER-exit site in C19 cells, we monitored the transport of VFG-GPI after temperature block and release. In WT cells, VFG-GPI that accumulated in the ER at time zero appeared in the Golgi at 10 min and nearly completely moved to the Golgi by 20 min (Figure S10). In C19 cells, the appearance of VFG-GPI in the Golgi was slow and the ER pattern remained even at 30 min. However, a dot-like pattern was not seen during the monitoring period, supporting that it has a defect in the GPI-APs sorting to the ER-exit site for the effective transport when PGAP5 is not functioning. The GPI glycan contains several phosphodiester bonds. Since PGAP5 possesses a phosphoesterase motif, we investigated whether the GPI glycan structure is changed in the mutant cells. His-Flag-GST-Flag-tagged CD59 (HFGF-CD59) was permanently expressed in WT, C19, and HA-PGAP5-carrying C19 cells, isolated from their cell surface and analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) after trypsin digestion. The molecular ions of the C-terminal peptide bearing GPI were screened by the presence of GPI-specific collision fragments of m/z 422.1+ (glucosaminyl-inositol-phosphate, GlcN-Ino-P) and 447.1+ (ethanolamine-phosphate-mannosyl-glucosamine, EtNP-Man-GlcN) in the second MS. As reported previously (Taguchi et al., 1994Taguchi R. Hamakawa N. Harada-Nishida M. Fukui T. Nojima K. Ikezawa H.

Taguchi R. Murata C. Ashida H. Kinoshita T. Maeda Y. PGAP2 is essential for correct processing and stable expression of GPI-anchored proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1410-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), most of the peptides bearing GPI consisted of peptide-EtNP-Man-Man-(EtNP)Man-GlcN-Ino-P in WT cells (Figure 5A). In contrast, the majority of the GPI structures in the mutant cells had an additional side-chain EtNP attached to Man2 (Figure 5B). In the revertant cells permanently expressing HA-tagged PGAP5, the structures had reverted to those of the WT cells (Figure 5C). These results indicate that PGAP5 is required for removal of a side-chain EtNP from Man2. To determine whether PGAP5 is the enzyme, we expressed His6-Flag-tagged PGAP5 (HF-PGAP5) in CHO cells, purified it, and established an in vitro enzyme assay. HF-PGAP5 was sequentially purified using a Ni column and anti-Flag beads and analyzed by silver staining. A prominent silver-stained band that migrated with a molecular mass of 50 kDa was confirmed to be HF-PGAP5 by western blot analysis with an anti-Flag antibody (Figure 6A). Although the natural substrate for PGAP5 was considered to be protein-linked GPI, it seemed difficult to measure its structural change and to prepare it in a sufficient amount. Therefore, we first measured the phosphoesterase activity using several artificial substrates, including p-nitrophenyl phosphate and monofluorophosphate. However, HF-PGAP5 did not recognize these molecules as substrates (data not shown). We subsequently used the GPI intermediate H8 as a substrate. H8 has structure EtNP-Man-(EtNP)Man-(EtNP)Man-GlcN-(acyl)PI, which is a complete precursor just before GPI attachment (Hirose et al., 1992Hirose S. Prince G.M. Sevlever D. Ravi L. Rosenberry T.L. Ueda E. Medof M.E. Characterization of putative glycoinositol phospholipid anchor precursors in mammalian cells. Localization of phosphoethanolamine.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16968-16974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When [14C]Man-labeled H8 was incubated with HF-PGAP5, it was efficiently converted into H7 lacking the side-chain EtNP on Man2 (Figure 6B), indicating that PGAP5 is the enzyme involved in the removal of EtNP from Man2 of GPI. The PGAP5 activity was time dependent and the reaction was linear up to ∼45 min under the conditions used (Figures 6C and 6D). The enzyme exhibited optimal activity at pH 7.0–7.5 (Figures 6E and 6F). We then examined the metal dependency of PGAP5. The yeast homolog of PGAP5, CDC1, is linked to Mn2+ homeostasis (Paidhungat and Garrett, 1998Paidhungat M. Garrett S. Cdc1 and the vacuole coordinately regulate Mn2+ homeostasis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1998; 148: 1787-1798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) since cdc1 mutant cells are rescued by Mn2+ supplementation and hypersensitive to the divalent cation chelator EGTA. As expected, Mn2+ was required for the PGAP5 activity. Zn2+ partially activated the PGAP5 activity. The PGAP5 activity was abolished by addition of EDTA to the reaction mixture (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2030626080,"Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)(2) is a classic glycolytic enzyme that also mediates cell death by its nuclear translocation under oxidative stress. Meanwhile, we previously presented that oxidative stress induced disulfide-bonded GAPDH aggregation in vitro. Here, we propose that GAPDH aggregate formation might participate in oxidative stress-induced cell death both in vitro and in vivo. We show that human GAPDH amyloid-like aggregate formation depends on the active site cysteine-152 (Cys-152) in vitro. In SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, treatment with dopamine decreases the cell viability concentration-dependently (IC(50) = 202 microM). Low concentrations of dopamine (50-100 microM) mainly cause nuclear translocation of GAPDH, whereas the levels of GAPDH aggregates correlate with high concentrations of dopamine (200-300 microM)-induced cell death. Doxycycline-inducible overexpression of wild-type GAPDH in SH-SY5Y, but not the Cys-152-substituted mutant (C152A-GAPDH), accelerates cell death accompanying both endogenous and exogenous GAPDH aggregate formation in response to high concentrations of dopamine. Deprenyl, a blocker of GAPDH nuclear translocation, fails to inhibit the aggregation both in vitro and in cells but reduced cell death in SH-SY5Y treated with only a low concentration of dopamine (100 microM). These results suggest that GAPDH participates in oxidative stress-induced cell death via an alternative mechanism in which aggregation but not nuclear translocation of GAPDH plays a role. Moreover, we observe endogenous GAPDH aggregate formation in nigra-striatum dopaminergic neurons after methamphetamine treatment in mice. In transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type GAPDH, increased dopaminergic neuron loss and GAPDH aggregate formation are observed. These data suggest a critical role of GAPDH aggregates in oxidative stress-induced brain damage."

https://openalex.org/W2168469435,"Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a major role in host defense against microbial infections in the lung. To perform this function, these cells must ingest and destroy pathogens, generally in phagosomes, as well as secrete a number of products that signal other immune cells to respond. Recently, we demonstrated that murine alveolar macrophages employ the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl(-) channel as a determinant in lysosomal acidification (Di, A., Brown, M. E., Deriy, L. V., Li, C., Szeto, F. L., Chen, Y., Huang, P., Tong, J., Naren, A. P., Bindokas, V., Palfrey, H. C., and Nelson, D. J. (2006) Nat. Cell Biol. 8, 933-944). Lysosomes and phagosomes in murine cftr(-/-) AMs failed to acidify, and the cells were deficient in bacterial killing compared with wild type controls. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in CFTR and is characterized by chronic lung infections. The information about relationships between the CFTR genotype and the disease phenotype is scarce both on the organismal and cellular level. The most common disease-causing mutation, DeltaF508, is found in 70% of patients with cystic fibrosis. The mutant protein fails to fold properly and is targeted for proteosomal degradation. G551D, the second most common mutation, causes loss of function of the protein at the plasma membrane. In this study, we have investigated the impact of CFTR DeltaF508 and G551D on a set of core intracellular functions, including organellar acidification, granule secretion, and microbicidal activity in the AM. Utilizing primary AMs from wild type, cftr(-/-), as well as mutant mice, we show a tight correlation between CFTR genotype and levels of lysosomal acidification, bacterial killing, and agonist-induced secretory responses, all of which would be expected to contribute to a significant impact on microbial clearance in the lung."
https://openalex.org/W2072041078,"Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are employed in first line therapies for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. They generally lack a 3'-hydroxyl group, and thus when incorporated into the nascent DNA they prevent further elongation. In this report we show that 4'-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (EFdA), a nucleoside analog that retains a 3'-hydroxyl moiety, inhibited HIV-1 replication in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with an EC(50) of 0.05 nm, a potency several orders of magnitude better than any of the current clinically used NRTIs. This exceptional antiviral activity stems in part from a mechanism of action that is different from approved NRTIs. Reverse transcriptase (RT) can use EFdA-5'-triphosphate (EFdA-TP) as a substrate more efficiently than the natural substrate, dATP. Importantly, despite the presence of a 3'-hydroxyl, the incorporated EFdA monophosphate (EFdA-MP) acted mainly as a de facto terminator of further RT-catalyzed DNA synthesis because of the difficulty of RT translocation on the nucleic acid primer possessing 3'-terminal EFdA-MP. EFdA-TP is thus a translocation-defective RT inhibitor (TDRTI). This diminished translocation kept the primer 3'-terminal EFdA-MP ideally located to undergo phosphorolytic excision. However, net phosphorolysis was not substantially increased, because of the apparently facile reincorporation of the newly excised EFdA-TP. Our molecular modeling studies suggest that the 4'-ethynyl fits into a hydrophobic pocket defined by RT residues Ala-114, Tyr-115, Phe-160, and Met-184 and the aliphatic chain of Asp-185. These interactions, which contribute to both enhanced RT utilization of EFdA-TP and difficulty in the translocation of 3'-terminal EFdA-MP primers, underlie the mechanism of action of this potent antiviral nucleoside."
https://openalex.org/W2142809851,"Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes the disease cholera, controls virulence factor production and biofilm development in response to two extracellular quorum-sensing molecules, called autoinducers. The strongest autoinducer, called CAI-1 (for cholera autoinducer-1), was previously identified as (S)-3-hydroxytridecan-4-one. Biosynthesis of CAI-1 requires the enzyme CqsA. Here, we determine the CqsA reaction mechanism, identify the CqsA substrates as (S)-2-aminobutyrate and decanoyl coenzyme A, and demonstrate that the product of the reaction is 3-aminotridecan-4-one, dubbed amino-CAI-1. CqsA produces amino-CAI-1 by a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent acyl-CoA transferase reaction. Amino-CAI-1 is converted to CAI-1 in a subsequent step via a CqsA-independent mechanism. Consistent with this, we find cells release > or =100 times more CAI-1 than amino-CAI-1. Nonetheless, V. cholerae responds to amino-CAI-1 as well as CAI-1, whereas other CAI-1 variants do not elicit a quorum-sensing response. Thus, both CAI-1 and amino-CAI-1 have potential as lead molecules in the development of an anticholera treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2147344322,"The enzyme telomerase extends telomeres at unprotected chromosomal ends. DNA double-stranded breaks could also form a substrate for telomerase, but DNA damage signalling induces the phosphorylation of the telomerase inhibitor Pif1 at breaks, preventing ectopic addition of telomeres at sites of repair and hence genomic instability. The response to DNA damage involves regulation of several essential processes to maximize the accuracy of DNA damage repair and cell survival1. Telomerase has the potential to interfere with repair by inappropriately adding telomeres to DNA breaks. It was unknown whether cells modulate telomerase in response to DNA damage to increase the accuracy of repair. Here, we report that telomerase action is regulated as a part of the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Using yeast, we show that the main ATR/Mec1 DNA damage signalling pathway regulates telomerase action at DSBs. After DNA damage, MEC1–RAD53–DUN1-dependent phosphorylation of the telomerase inhibitor Pif1 occurs. Using a separation of function PIF1 mutation, we show that this phosphorylation is specifically required for the Pif1-mediated telomerase inhibition that takes place at DNA breaks, but not for that at telomeres. Hence DNA damage signalling down-modulates telomerase action at DNA breaks through Pif1 phosphorylation, thus preventing aberrant healing of broken DNA ends by telomerase. These findings uncover a new regulatory mechanism that coordinates competing DNA end-processing activities and thereby promotes DNA repair accuracy and genome integrity."

Previous work has shown that β3 integrin can regulate negatively VEGFR2 expression. Here we show that β3 integrin can regulate negatively VEGF-mediated angiogenesis by limiting the interaction of the co-receptor NRP1 (neuropilin-1) with VEGFR2. In the presence of αvβ3 integrin, NRP1 contributed minimally to VEGF-induced angiogenic processes in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro. Conversely, when β3 integrin expression is absent or low or its function is blocked with RGD-mimetic inhibitors, VEGF-mediated responses became NRP1-dependent. Indeed, combined inhibition of β3 integrin and NRP1 decreased VEGF-mediated angiogenic responses further than individual inhibition of these receptors. We also show that αvβ3 integrin can associate with NRP1 in a VEGF-dependent fashion.

The immune system enables a host to discriminate self from non-self antigens so that invading pathogens can be recognized, captured, and eradicated. Adaptive immunity relies on highly polymorphic molecules, such as class I and class II major histocompatibility complexes, to present antigens to T and B cells and to initiate an immune response against foreign antigens. Whereas adaptive immunity implements highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex molecules for presenting specific antigens, innate immunity recognizes a diverse class of antigens by “pattern recognition” (1.Janeway Jr., C.A.

Among the innate immune receptors (IIRs), CLRs are vital carbohydrate-recognizing proteins that mediate pathogen recognition/clearance, immune cell interactions, and endothelium cell adhesion. These proteins are characterized by the presence of highly conserved carbohydrate recognition domains that are responsible for binding to a variety of glycoproteins and glycolipids via their carbohydrate portion of the molecule. CLRs are able to activate and modulate host immunity through protein-protein interactions and/or by using their carbohydrate recognition domains to interact with glycans (5.Cambi A. Figdor C.G. Curr.

To better understand the underlying mechanisms of self versus non-self recognition in the immune system, it is important to study the binding characteristics of CLRs to their glycoconjugate ligands. Ganoderma and Cordyceps are among the most popular fungi used for dietary supplement and/or herbal medicine in eastern Asia. The polysaccharide extracts from Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi or Ling-Zhi), abbreviated as GLPS, contain active anti-tumor and immune modulation activities (20.Lien E.J. Prog.

In addition, the polysaccharides extracted from Cordyceps (caterpillar fungus), also known as CPS, alter apoptotic homeostasis, improve respiratory, renal, and cardiovascular functions (24.Buenz E.J.

The major polysaccharide backbones of GLPS and CPS are β-glucans and α(1–4)-mannan, although the composition is highly variable due to strain diversity, culture conditions, and extraction methods. As such, the beneficial activities of GLPS and CPS are difficult to reproduce. Analytical methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography and proton-nuclear magnetic resonance techniques have been applied to monitor and investigate the components derived from medicinal herbs, but these methods are not suitable for analyzing large and complex molecules such as GLPS and CPS. Here, we develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) based on Fc-tagged recombinant IIR fusion proteins to investigate the profiles of GLPS and CPS derived from various sources. This IIR-EIA analyzes the polysaccharides and glycoconjugates in natural products quantitatively and qualitatively. The method of IIR-EIA will be useful for resolving the biological functions of medicinal polysaccharides. The FreeStyleTM 293-F cells (Invitrogen) were cultured with FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium (Invitrogen) in Erlenmeyer flasks and incubated in a 37 °C incubator containing 8% CO2 on an orbital shaker rotating at 125 rpm. Mannan (α-linked, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae), β-glucan (from barley), cellulose (carboxymethylated, with average Mr ∼90,000), dextran (Mr ∼100,000), laminarin, fucoidan, β(1–4)-mannan, and monosaccharides were purchased from Sigma; amylopectin, galactan, and arabinogalactan (from larch) were purchased from Megazyme (Wicklow, Ireland). Mannan, cellulose, dextran, laminarin, fucoidan, galactan, arabinogalactan, and all the monosaccharides were dissolved in pure water. Stock solutions of β(1–4)-mannan (5 mg/ml) and amylopectin (10 mg/ml) were made by dissolving in 0.75 and 0.5 n NaOH, respectively. For dissolving cellulose, 5 mg/ml of stock solution was heated at 90 °C with vigorous shaking for 30 min. For preparing β-glucan stock solution, 3 mg of β-glucan was first dissolved in 0.2 ml of DMSO by heating at 60 °C with shaking for 30 min, followed by mixing in 0.8 ml of pure water and another 30 min of 60 °C incubation with vigorous shaking. The DNA fragments encoding extracellular domains of CLRs, and TLRs were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+)-hIgG1 Fc or pSecTag2C-hIgG1 Fc (gifts from Hugh O. McDevitt, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA) vectors to generate N- or C-terminal hIgG1 Fc-tagged fusion proteins, respectively. Primer pairs for amplifying extracellular domains of IIRs are listed in Table 1. The receptor-Fc proteins were overexpressed using the FreeStyle 293 Expression System (Invitrogen).

The culture supernatants were harvested at days 3 and 5, and the recombinant receptor-Fc proteins were purified by Protein A columns (GE Healthcare). Purified IIR-Fc proteins were examined for their sizes by SDS-PAGE with or without the addition of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (supplemental Fig. S1).TABLE 1Primer pairs for amplifying IIR extracellular domain fragmentsInnate immune receptor (IIR)Other namesForward primerReverse primerAICLCLEC2B, CLECSF2GGATCCTCTCAGAGTTTATGCCCCGGATCCCCCCATTATCTTAGACATBDCA2CLEC4C, DLEC, HECL, CLECSF11, CLECSF7GGATCCTTTATGTATAGCAAAACTGTCAAGGAATTCTTATATGTAGATCTTCTTCATCTTCLEC2CLEC1BGGATCCATGCAGCGCAATTACCTACAAGAATTCTTAAGGTAGTTGGTCCACCTTGCLEC6CLEC4D, Mpc1, MCL, CLECSF8GGATCCCATCACAACTTTTCACGCTGTGAATTCCTAGTTCAATGTTGTTCCAGGDCIRCLEC4A, DDB27, CLECSF6GGATCCTTTCAAAAATATTCTCAGCTTCTTGAATTCTCATAAGTGGATCTTCATCATCDC-SIGNCLEC4L, CD209GGATCCAAGGTCCCCAGCTCCATAAGGAATTCCTACGCAGGAGGGGGGTDectin-1CLEC7A, β-glucan receptor, CLECSF12GGATCCACCATGGCTATTTGGAGATCCGAATTCTTACATTGAAAACTTCTTCTCACLangerinCLEC4K, CD207GGATCCCGGTTTATGGGCACCATAGGATCCTCACGGTTCTGATGGGACNKG2DKLRK1GGAGTGCTGTATTCCTAAACGAATTCCTGGCTTTTATTGAGATGGMDL1CLEC5A, CLECSF5AGATCTAGTAACGATGGTTTCACCACGAATTCCTGTGATCATTTGGCATTCTTMouse KCRKupffer cell receptorCAGCCTTGGAGACCTGAGTCTAGCCTACTCTGGCCGCDCAL1CLECL1GGATCCTACGCTGACATCAAAACTGTTGAATTCTAAATGTTAAATCTCACCATAGCDEC205CLEC13B, LY75, CD205GCCGGCCTGGCCGCGCAGCTAATGAGCGGCCGCGGCACTTTGCAGACAACTCEndo180CLEC13E, MRC2GATATCCGGAACCCAACATCTTCCGCGGCCGCAGCGCTGATGGGGAGAAGCTMMRCLEC13D, MRC1GGTACCTACTGGACACCAGGCAATTGCGGCCGCGAAGGGTCCATCTTCCTTGTLR2TIL4, CD282GCGGATCCAGGAAGAATCCTCCAATCAGGCGCGGCCGCGTCCTGTGACATTCCGACACTLR4hToll, CD284GCGGATCCAAAGCTGGGAGCCCTGCGTGCGCGGCCGCTTATTCATCTGACAGGTGATA Open table in a new tab The polysaccharide components of GLPS-F3 were prepared according to the procedures described previously (23.Wang Y.Y.

In brief, crude Reishi powders (broken spores and fruiting bodies) were stirred in boiling water for 2 h, and centrifuged to remove the insoluble materials. The resulting solution was concentrated, lyophilized, and dissolved in a small volume of 0.1 n Tris buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 n sodium azide, and purified by gel filtration chromatography at 4 °C using a Sephacryl S-500 column (95 × 2.6 cm) to obtain GLPS-F3. Fractions were subjected to the phenol-sulfuric acid method to detect sugar concentration, concentrated, dialyzed with a 6000–8000-dalton MWCO membrane against water, and lyophilized to give GLPS-F3 powders. The estimated molecular weights of GLPS-F3 were larger than 1,000,000 according to the elution time shown in gel filtration chromatography. The biotinylation of GLPS-F3 was performed in a one-pot procedure. GLPS-F3 (100 mg) in 0.2 n NaHCO3/Na2CO3 (10 ml) was reacted with biotinamidohexanoyl-6-amino-hexanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (biotin-XX-NHS, 1.0 mg) in N,N-dimethylformamide (1 ml) and stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The resulting solution was dialyzed against water (500 ml for five times) with a 6000–8000-dalton MWCO membrane at 4 °C within 48 h. After dialysis, the biotinylated F3 was lyophilized to give a brown powder of 90 mg (90%). The purity of biotinylated GLPS-F3 was monitored by high-pressure liquid chromatography and streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate in binding assay. Samples of GLPS-F3 and biotinylated GLPS-F3 were weighed, dissolved, and diluted with 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 9.5) to give 0.2–20 μg/ml. Diluted GLPS-F3 was then immobilized in the wells of 96-well Nunc MaxiSorpTM plates (50 μl/well, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). After incubation overnight at 4 °C, wells were washed twice with TBST (0.05% Tween 20/TBS), followed by blocking with 200 μl of blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin/TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. Peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was diluted (1:5000) in blocking buffer (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and added 100 μl per well to detect the immobilized biotinylated GLPS-F3 after incubation at room temperature for 30 min. Alternatively, for examining the interaction with GLPS-F3 that was immobilized and blocked as described above, 100 μl of IIR-Fc fusion protein (1 μg/ml in 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin/TBST) in the presence or absence of competitors was added into each well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBST, each well was incubated with 100 μl of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in blocking buffer (1:5000) at room temperature for 30 min. Wells were incubated with 100 μl of tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Pierce) for 15 min after the TBST wash and read at 450 nm in a plate reader. For profiling of GLPS and the CPS mixture derived from different sources, samples were first measured for their sugar contents by phenol-sulfuric acid method, and the sugar concentrations were then used to calculate the amounts for immobilization on 96-well plates (250 ng/well). CPS samples were obtained from Wyntek Corporation (Taipei, Taiwan). The DNA fragments encoding the extracellular domain of IIRs including CLRs and TLRs were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using the cDNA templates derived from various immune cells. These amplified DNA fragments were subcloned into mammalian expression vectors. The vectors contained an Fc fusion, consisting of a mutated human IgG1 Fc portion lacking the human Fc receptors binding capability (28.Ettinger R. Browning J.L. Michie S.A. van Ewijk W. McDevitt H.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13102-13107Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, the hinge region of IgG1 Fc was preserved to produce dimeric fusion proteins that allow for divalent interactions. The extracellular domains of the type I and II transmembrane receptors were fused at the N terminus (receptor-Fc) and C terminus (Fc-receptor), respectively. The IIR-Fc proteins were submitted to the Consortium for the Functional Glycomics (CFG) for glycan array analysis to understand more about their detailed carbohydrate recognition capability. All of the glycan binding data for the IIRs are available through Functional Glycomics Gateway. Table 2 summarizes the IIR-Fc proteins studied by EIA along with their glycan-binding characteristics. Of these 17 IIRs, 12 were submitted for CFG glycan array analysis by us, and six IIRs among them (Fc-tagged AICL, BDCA2, CLEC2, DCIR, Langerin, and MMR) show binding to the glycans on this array. The individual glycan binding profiles for these recombinant IIR proteins we submitted for CFG glycan array analysis can be found in supplemental Figs. S2–S7. In addition to these six IIRs, recombinant DC-SIGN and Kupffer cell receptor (KCR) proteins from other groups have also been characterized for their sugar-binding properties via CFG glycan arrays (29.Coombs P.J. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 1C-7CCrossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30.Guo Y. Feinberg H. Conroy E. Mitchell D.A. Alvarez R. Blixt O. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The binding profiles of these two proteins are thus included in Table 2 as well. A high proportion of IIRs interact with sulfated lactose (Lac) or N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc). CLEC2, DC-SIGN, Dectin-2, Langerin, and MMR bind to high mannose (Man) structures. In addition to the sulfated LacNAc/Lac, BDCA2 and DC-SIGN also bind biantennary N-glycans with or without core fucosylation and terminal sialylation, suggesting that they interact with heavily N-glycosylated proteins on the cell surface. AICL, CLEC2, DC-SIGN, and Langerin can bind fucose (Fuc)-containing antigens, such as H, Lewis, or sialyl Lewis antigens, indicating their ability to recognize Fuc. In addition, the results indicate that CLEC2 and MMR have a higher tendency to bind poly α2–8-linked sialic acid (NeuAc); notably, this polysialic acid has been shown to mediate cancer growth and invasion (31.Seidenfaden R.

Overall, the results from glycan array analysis provide greater insight into the carbohydrate recognition capabilities of each IIR, which will likely help delineate the molecular characteristics of their natural glycoconjugate substrates.TABLE 2Carbohydrate-binding characteristics of IIRsInnate immune receptor (IIR)Other namesData available in CFG glycan array databaseCarbohydrate-binding characteristics (CFG glycan array data)AICLCLEC2B, CLECSF2Yes1.

Open table in a new tab To demonstrate the possibility of using IIR for profiling unidentified glycan mixtures, all 17 IIR-Fc fusion proteins were tested for binding specificity and sensitivity to GLPS-F3. GLPS-F3 is the water-soluble polysaccharide fraction extracted from G. lucidum capable of inducing immune cell activation (23.Wang Y.Y. Khoo K.H. Chen S.T. Lin C.C. Wong C.H. Lin C.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2002; 10: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). According to the previous analysis (23.Wang Y.Y. Khoo K.H. Chen S.T. Lin C.C. Wong C.H. Lin C.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2002; 10: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the carbohydrates in GLPS-F3 are composed of 58% glucose, 15% mannose, 14% galactose, 7% Fuc, 3% xylose, and 1% N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and 2% other monosaccharides, but no sialic acid. Protein accounts for ∼30% of GLPS-F3 in weight (data not shown), indicating that GLPS-F3 is a mixture of polysaccharides and proteins (or glycoproteins) with very high molecular masses (>1000 kDa). The IIR-EIA of immobilized GLPS-F3 in microtiter plates was established to investigate the interaction between GLPS-F3 and IIR fusion proteins. To optimize the immobilization condition, various amounts of biotinylated-GLPS-F3 (biotin-GLPS-F3) ranging from 10 to 1000 ng/well were coated on microtiter plates through both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions. For read out, peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and then chromogen substrate tetramethylbenzidine were subsequently added. As shown in Fig. 1A, the intensity of coloration reached a plateau at 100 ng/well; therefore this concentration was used for immobilization of un-biotinylated GLPS-F3 in the IIR-EIA. As expected, Fc-Dectin-1 (β-glucan receptor) bound strongly to GLPS-F3 (Fig. 1B), which contains β(1,3)-glucan as the major backbone (33.Usui T. Iwasaki Y. Mizuno T. Tanaka M. Shinkai K. Arakawa M. Carbohydr. Res. 1983; 115: 273-280Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, Fc-mKCR, Fc-Langerin, and Fc-DC-SIGN also bound to GLPS-F3 specifically (OD450 > 0.6), whereas weaker but positive binding was also observed between GLPS-F3 and TLR2, TLR4, MMR, CLEC2, and CLEC6 (0.4 < OD450 < 0.6). Notably, both TLR2 and TLR4 were reported to mediate GLPS-induced cell activation (34.Chen H.S. Tsai Y.F. Lin S. Lin C.C. Khoo K.H. Lin C.H. Wong C.H. Bioorg. Med.

However, none of these receptors have been reported to play a role in GLPS-mediated cell activation. Other CLRs including Fc-tagged AICL, BDCA2, DCIR, and MDL-1 showed a minimal capability to bind to GLPS-F3, with the signal similar to that of human IgG1 control. Among the non-binders, Fc-AICL, Fc-BDCA2, and Fc-DCIR display binding capabilities to specific ligands on CFG glycan arrays, whereas Fc-MDL-1 (also known as CLEC5A) has been demonstrated to interact with dengue virus (38.Chen S.T. Lin Y.L. Huang M.T. Wu M.F. Cheng S.C. Lei H.Y. Lee C.K. Chiou T.W. Wong C.H. Hsieh S.L. Nature. 2008; 453: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) although it shows no binding on the glycan array. Here, we provide evidence that these five recombinant IIR proteins do have binding abilities to various ligands but not GLPS-F3. Considering that the biotinylation of GLPS-F3 may change the immobilization behavior of GLPS-F3 on EIA plates,"
https://openalex.org/W2124233979,"Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are heterogeneous rheumatic disorders of unknown cause characterized by muscle weakness, inflammatory cell infiltrates, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression on muscle fibers. The nonhistone nuclear protein alarmin high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) has been detected extranuclearly in muscle biopsies from patients with IIMs. We hypothesize that HMGB1 has a central role in the cause of muscle weakness, particularly in the early phases of IIMs. Experiments were performed on skeletal muscle fibers isolated from adult mice, which were exposed to recombinant interferon (IFN)-γ or HMGB1. The myoplasmic free [Ca2+] was measured. Stimulation with IFN-γ resulted in increased HMGB1 expression in muscle nuclei and the myoplasm. Exposure to HMGB1 induced a reversible up-regulation of MHC class I in the muscle fibers. However, HMGB1 exposure caused an irreversible decrease in Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during fatigue, induced by repeated tetanic contractions. HMGB1 and MHC class I were frequently colocalized in the myoplasm of muscle fibers in muscle biopsies from patients with early IIMs. However, HMGB1-expressing fibers outnumbered fibers expressing MHC class I. Our data indicate that HMGB1 could be an early inducer of skeletal muscle dysfunction in IIMs.—Grundtman, C., Bruton, J., Yamada, T., Östberg, T., Pisetsky, D. S., Harris, H.

https://openalex.org/W2024698835,"Chk1, one of the critical transducers in DNA damage/replication checkpoints, prevents entry into mitosis through inhibition of Cdk1 activity. However, it has remained unclear how this inhibition is cancelled at the G2/M transition. We reported recently that Chk1 is phosphorylated at Ser286 and Ser301 by Cdk1 during mitosis. Here, we show that mitotic Chk1 phosphorylation is accompanied by Chk1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in prophase. This translocation advanced in accordance with prophase progression and was regulated by Crm-1-dependent nuclear export. Exogenous Chk1 mutated at Ser286 and Ser301 to Ala (S286A/S301A) was observed mainly in the nuclei of prophase cells, although such nuclear accumulation was hardly observed in wild-type Chk1. Induction of S286A/S301A resulted in the delay of mitotic entry. Biochemical analyses using immunoprecipitated cyclin B1-Cdk1 complexes revealed S286A/S301A expression to block the adequate activation of Cdk1. In support of this, S286A/S301A expression retained Wee1 at higher levels and Cdk1-induced phosphorylation of cyclin B1 and vimentin at lower levels. A kinase-dead version of S286A/S301A also localized predominantly in the nucleus but lost the ability to delay mitotic entry. These results indicate that Chk1 phosphorylation by Cdk1 participates in cytoplasmic sequestration of Chk1 activity, which releases Cdk1 inhibition in the nucleus and promotes mitotic entry.

Accumulating evidence from microarray analyses and animal genetic models highlights the central involvement of the transcription factor early growth response-1 (EGR-1) in prostate carcinoma progression. It is unknown, however, whether knockdown of EGR-1 inhibits IL-8 production and IL-8-mediated tumor metastasis. Here we show that EGR-1 knockdown by a specific shRNA-Egr1 inhibited gene transcription and production of IL-8 by the human prostate cancer cell line DU145. Conversely, enforced expression of EGR-1 in EGR-1-lacking PC3 prostate cancer cells markedly enhanced IL-8 transcription and secretion. By using wild type and a series of mutant IL-8 promoter luciferase constructs, we found that the NF-κB binding site is important for EGR-1 regulation of IL-8. Furthermore, silencing EGR-1 suppressed a synergistically functional interaction between EGR-1 and NF-κB. Consequently, knockdown of EGR-1 inhibited IL-8-mediated tumor colony formation and invasion. Thus, targeted knockdown of EGR-1 could be an effective therapeutic approach against prostate cancer.

In contrast, Huang et al., reported that IL-8 was expressed solely by neuroendocrine rather than epithelial cells.

In addition, loss of the EGR-1 corepressor NAB2 enhances the EGR-1 levels in prostate cancer. Although there is no EGR-1 binding motif in the promoter of the interleukin 8 gene, EGR-1-associated IL-8 production was investigated in combination with three central transcription factors such as NF-κB, C/EBP, or AP-1 (22.Moon Y. Yang H. Lee S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The expression of EGR-1 can be induced by a range of stimuli, which in many cases overlap with those known to be capable of inducing NF-κB expression. NF-κB and EGR-1 have been shown to cooperatively stimulate the NF-κB promoter (23.Cogswell P.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Exp.

In addition, it has been reported that EGR-1 regulates proinflammatory cytokine gene expression by synergistic interaction with other transcription factors such as nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT) (25.Decker E.L.

The proinflammatory chemokine IL-8 is undetectable in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells (e.g. LNCaP and LAPC-4), but it is highly expressed in androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer tissue (9.Huang J.

Therefore, IL-8 is associated with chemoresistance, tumor growth, and angiogenesis in androgen-independent prostate carcinoma (28.Araki S. Omori Y. Lyn D. Singh R.K. Meinbach D.M. Sandman Y.

In the present study, we used DU145/sh-EGR1 and DU145/sh-Control stable cell lines to evaluate the effect of EGR-1 knockdown on IL-8 transcription and production by human prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, it appears that EGR-1 functions cooperatively with NF-κB to stimulate IL-8 transcription and production. Our data demonstrate knockdown of EGR-1-inhibited tumor colony formation and invasion may be through the down-regulation of IL-8. Thus, targeted knockdown of EGR-1 could be an effective therapeutic approach against prostate cancer. All reagents and chemicals and affinity-purified anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent tags were purchased from Sigma. The following specific antibodies were used in this study: anti-NF-κB p65 and p50 (Upstate Biotech); anti-EGR-1, anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), The IL-8 ELISA kit was purchased from R&D Systems. QCMTM 24-Well Cell Invasion Assay kit was purchased from Chemicon Corp. The empty pU6 + 27, shRNA-control and shRNA-p65 vectors were purchased from Panomics Corp. (Fremont, CA). A 21-nucleotide sequence coding for amino acids 413–419 of human Egr-1 was selected as the targets for RNAi according to the manufacturer's instructions. In all cases, the corresponding sequences were scrambled to generate a control vector. In initial studies, we used empty vector (pU6 + 27) and scrambled shRNA as controls. Double-strand siRNAs targeting NF-κB (p65) and scramble control were synthesized using the following sequences: siRNA-p65: forward 5′-GAU UGA GGA GAA ACG UAA AdTdT, reverse 5′-UUU ACG UUU CUC CUC AAU CdTdT; siRNA-scramble: forward 5′-AUG AAC GUG AAU UGC UCA AdTdT, Reverse 5′-UUG AGC AAU UCA CGU UCA UdTdT. siRNA duplexes were purchased from Invitrogen. To construct the IL-8 promoter luciferase reporter, a 350-bp DNA fragment from the promoter region of the human IL-8 gene, including −323 to +27 nt upstream of the start ATG, was obtained by PCR using human genomic DNA as the template and primer pair IL-8-pf: 5′- CGA CGC GTC ACC TGC CAC TCT AGT ACT A-3′ and IL-8-pr: 5′- CCG CTC GAG AAG CTT GTG TGC TCT GCT G-3′, where the restriction enzyme sites for cloning are indicated by underlines. The PCR products were inserted into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, MI) and designated as pGL3-IL-8-wt. The AP-1, CEBP, and NF-κB binding sites were each mutated using site-directed mutagenesis as indicated in Fig. 3A. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The Egr-1 expression plasmids containing a full-length cDNA coding for human EGR-1 were generous gifts from Dr. Jie Du, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. Human prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC3, were purchased from ATCC and cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen) was employed for transfection. The stably transfected cell lines were obtained after being selectively screened by G418 (800 μg/ml, GIBCO) for 3–4 weeks. Total RNA was isolated by TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 1 μg was converted to cDNA using the Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The following primer sets were used for RT-PCR and real-time PCR with Cyber-Green incorporation: huIL-8-RT- Re: TGG TGG CGC AGT GTG GTC CA, huIL-8-RT- Fw: AAG CTG GCC GTG GCT CTC TT; β-ACTIN-Re: GTC ACA CTT CAT GAT GGA GTT GAA GG, β-ACTIN-Fw: GAC CTG ACT GAC TAC CTC ATG AAG AT; Egr-1-Re: TGG GTG CCG CTG AGT AAA TG, Egr-1-Fw: CTG ACC GCA GAG TCT TTT CCT G. For preparing the whole cell extract, cells were harvested and lysed in the Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and freshly added proteinase inhibitors, including 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 1 μg/ml pepstatin (Sigma), and 1 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma). Lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce Chemical Co.) was used to detect specific immunoreactive proteins. Cellular lysates were prepared using a radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF). Equivalent amount of total protein was incubated with 2 μg of specific antibody or control IgG at 4 °C overnight. The immune complexes were captured by incubation with protein A-agarose at 4 °C for 2 h, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to Western blotting with specific antibodies. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to fixation with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 7 min. The cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) and sonicated to shear the chromatin (∼500 bp). The soluble fraction was collected by centrifugation and incubated with specific antibodies or control IgG at 4 °C overnight. The immune complexes were captured with protein A-agarose beads. After extensive washing, the bound DNA fragments were eluted and purified (32.Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O'Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Tachibana M.

DNA from these samples was subjected to PCR analyses with NF-κB-BS-pf: 5′-CAT CAG TTG CAA ATC GTG GA-3′ and NF-κB-BS-pr: 5′-GAA GCT TGT GTG CTC TGC TG-3′; GAPDH-pf: 5′-GTA TTC CCC CAG GTT TAC AT-3′ and GAPDH-pr: 5′-TTC TGT CTT CCA CTC ACT CCT-3′. The PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The GAPDH promoter fragment acted as the internal negative control for this assay. Briefly, an appropriate amount of the IL-8 promoter-luciferase reporters, together with Renilla luciferase plasmids, which served as the internal control, were co-transfected into cells. 24 h later, cellular lysates were subjected to Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activities for the promoter reporters were normalized to Renilla luciferase activities. Data are presented as the ratio of IL8-Wt in DU145/sh-Con cells. Data represent at least three independent experiments, and in each experiment, there were triplicate tests for all samples. Forty-eight hours after transfection with siRNA, 5 × 103 cells were suspended in 1.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.35% agar and 10% fetal bovine serum and seeded in 6-well plates precoated with the same medium used for suspending the cells except containing 0.5% agar. The cells were allowed to form colonies for 14 days. At the end, the colonies were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 10 min at 37 °C and counted. The experiments were repeated at least twice with three or six replicates in each experiment, and the data are presented as the mean of multiple tests. The Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. ELISA assays were performed using IL-8 ELISA kits from R&D Systems according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell culture supernatants were collected and diluted 5–160-fold with deionized water before assaying. The data represent the mean of at least two experiments and triplicate samples for each experiment. Stable transfected DU145/sh-con and DU145/sh-Egr1 cells were transiently transfected with either si-Scramble or si-IL-8 RNA duplexes (Invitrogen) before incubation for 48 h; the cells were plated onto Matrigel-coated wells and cultured for another 48 h. By the end, the cells in the lower chamber of the transwells were collected, and cell numbers were detected by CyQUANT@GR Dye (QCMTM 24-Well Cell Invasion Assay kit from Chemicon Corp.) per the manufacturer's instruction. Data are presented as relative luminescence units and the mean of three samples in each experiment. To determine whether EGR-1 regulates transcription and secretion of IL-8 by prostate cancer cells, DU145 cells were transfected with shRNA-EGR-1 plasmids or control plasmids to generate the DU145/sh-EGR-1 and DU145/sh-Con stable cell lines, respectively. The level of EGR-1 expression in both cell lines was analyzed by Western blotting, RT-PCR, and real-time PCR. As show in Fig. 1A, a significant reduction of EGR-1 expression was observed, confirming the knockdown of Egr-1 in DU145/sh-EGR-1 stable prostate cancer cells. RT-PCR (Fig. 1B) and real-time PCR (Fig. 1C) showed that the level of transcripts of IL-8 was reduced in the DU145 cell with EGR-1-knockdown compared with the control cells. Furthermore, IL-8 secretion by the above cell lines was also measured by ELISA. Knockdown of EGR-1 resulted in a significant decrease of IL-8 production (Fig. 1D). Because PC3, another prostate cancer cell line, expresses little detectable EGR-1 mRNA, we used PC3 cells as a model system to directly assess the actual role of EGR-1 expression in the EGR-1-mediated IL-8 production by prostate cancer cells. The PC3 cells were transfected with plasmids containing either cDNA coding for full-length human EGR-1 wild type or empty vector pcDNA3.1. Compared with the control PC3 cells, the level of IL-8 transcription and secretion was significantly higher in the EGR1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1, E and F). These results suggested that expression and secretion of IL-8 by prostate cancer cells are correlated with the level of EGR-1. Although there is no EGR-1 binding motif in the promoter of the interleukin 8 gene, EGR-1-associated IL-8 production may be regulated by other transcription factors such as NF-κB, C/EBP, or AP-1 because the IL-8 promoter contains these binding sites. We used wild type and a series of mutant IL-8 promoter luciferase constructs to assess whether EGR-1 affects activation of IL-8 promoter mediated by the above transcription factor binding sites. DU145/sh-Con and DU145/sh-EGR-1 cells were transiently transfected with the −323 bp IL-8 promoter construct and mutation constructs each containing AP-1 (−126 to −120), C/EBP (−94 to −81), or NF-κB site mutations (−80 to −69) (Fig. 2A) for 48 h and assayed for luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 2B, compared with the control DU145 cells, knockdown of EGR-1 resulted in a 60% loss in IL-8 promoter luciferase activity of transfected cells with a wild-type construct, confirming that EGR-1 regulates IL-8 promoter activity in prostate cancer cells. When cells were transfected with an IL-8 promoter construct containing a single C/EBP site mutant (−94 to −81) or AP-1 site mutant (−126 to −120), IL-8 promoter activation was affected by knockdown of EGR-1. However, in the case of the transfected cells with the construct with a single mutation of the NF-κB site, there was a lower level of IL-8 promoter luciferase activity than that of the wild-type construct. In addition, no difference in transactivation of the IL-8 promoter containing an NF-κB binding site mutation between DU145/sh-EGR-1 and control cells was observed, demonstrating that EGR-1-regulating transactivation of IL-8 promoter is associated with NF-κB. Furthermore, similar experiments were performed on EGR-1-overexpressing PC3 cells and their parent cells (Fig. 2C). Overexpression of EGR-1 in PC3 prostate cancer cells markedly enhanced IL-8 promoter activity, but did not affect activity of IL-8 promoter with a single NF-κB site mutation. These data indicate that the NF-κB site is the most important positive regulatory element and the target site for EGR-1 activation of IL-8 promoter transactivation in prostate cancer cells. We used ChIP to directly assess whether EGR-1 binds to the NF-κB binding site of IL-8 promoter. Stably transfected DU145/sh-con and DU145/sh-EGR-1 cells were harvested for the preparation of chromatin, which was immunoprecipitated with anti-EGR-1, -NF-κB p65, and -NF-κB p50 antibodies or normal IgG. Genomic fragments associated with immunoprecipitated DNA were amplified by PCR using specific primers flanking the NF-κB binding site within the IL-8 promoter (Fig. 3A, left panel). Not only did NF-κB bind to its specific binding site in the IL-8 promoter, but also the occupancy by EGR-1 of the NF-κB site was detected. Transfection with sh-Egr1 resulted in the decrease in such EGR-1 occupancy of NF-κB site in IL-8 promoter. To further examine whether the binding of EGR-1 to IL-8 promoter is dependent on NF-κB, another ChIP assay was performed using control and p65 knockdown cells (Fig. 3A, right panel). Knockdown of p65 decreased the association of EGR-1 to a region (−500 bp) that contains the κB site in IL-8 promoter, demonstrating that the molecular interplay between EGR-1 and NF-κB in the regulation of IL-8 is dependent on p65. Similar results were observed in co-immunoprecipitation analysis performed with cell lysates from parent DU145 cells using anti-NF-κB p65 monoclonal antibody for immunoprecipitation and anti-EGR-1 for blotting (Fig. 3B). The data indicated that EGR-1 formed a complex with NF-κB binding to the IL-8 promoter. Next, we examined whether EGR-1 affected expression and phosphorylation of NF-κB using Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3C, neither the level of expression, nor phosphorylation of NF-κB was affected by knockdown of EGR-1. This suggested that EGR-1 regulates IL-8 through facilitating NF-κB regulatory activity on the IL-8 promoter. To further investigate how the EGR-1/NF-κB complex affects the expression of IL-8, DU145/sh-EGR-1 stable cell line and its parent cell line were transfected with RNA duplexes siRNA-p65 or siRNA scramble that either specifically targeted the NF-κB p65 coding region or served as control, respectively. In contrast to scramble transfections, transcription and expression of both NF-κB p65 and EGR-1 were significantly reduced in DU145/sh-Egr1 cells transfected with siRNA-p65 determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 4A) and Western blot (Fig. 4B), confirming double knockdown of NF-κB p65 and EGR-1. IL-8 secretion by the same cells was measured by ELISA (Fig. 4C). Comparing the DU145 cells transfected with either sh-Egr1 or si-p65 alone, double knockdown of EGR-1 and NF-κB p65 resulted in a remarkable loss of IL-8 production. This suggested that EGR-1 functions cooperatively with NF-κB to stimulate IL-8 transcription and production. Silencing EGR-1 suppressed a synergistically functional interaction between EGR-1 and NF-κB. Because IL-8 has been reported to be involved in tumor colony formation and invasion, we investigated whether EGR-1 might further regulate IL-8-mediated tumor colony formation and invasion. Stably transfected DU145/sh-EGR-1 and DU145/sh-Con cells were transiently transfected with either siRNA-IL-8 or siRNA-Scramble. A human tumor colony-forming assay (Fig. 5, A and B) and in vitro chemoinvasion assay (Fig. 5C) were performed with the cells under different conditions. When the level of IL-8 in DU145 cells was reduced by transfection with siRNA-IL-8, both the tumor colony number and invasion activity of DU145 cells were significantly dropped off, confirming that IL-8 stimulates tumor colony formation and invasion of prostate cancer cells. In DU145 cells with knockdown of EGR-1, the number of tumor colonies and invasion of cells through the extracellular matrix were significantly decreased compared with the control DU145 cells (Fig. 5, A, B, and C, respectively). Silencing IL-8 also attenuated EGR-1 knockdown-caused inhibition of the tumor colony number and invasion activity on DU145 cells. The data indicated that knockdown of EGR-1 inhibited tumor colony formation and invasion that might be through down-regulation of IL-8. Because other growth factors in addition to IL-8 may also participate in tumor invasion, we further examined the gene expression profile in EGR-1 knockdown prostate cells. In DU145/sh-EGR1 cells, the expression levels of EGF, PGDF-α, and IGF2 were significantly less than that in control DU145 cells (Fig. 5D). However, the expression of ICAM-1 and VEGF was not affected by EGR-1 knockdown. Therefore, besides IL-8, the role of other growth factors in tumor invasion needs to be further investigated. The expression of IL-8 has been shown to correlate with the angiogenesis, tumorigenicity, and metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells. Inhibiting these pronounced effects of IL-8 signaling within the tumor microenvironment may have significant therapeutic potential in modulating disease progression (1.Moore B.B. Arenberg D.A. Stoy K. Morgan T. Addison C.L. Morris S.B. Glass M. Wilke C. Xue Y.Y. Sitterding S. Kunkel S.L. Burdick M.D. Strieter R.M. Am. J.

This study revealed that EGR-1 knockdown resulted in significant reduction in the expression of IL-8 gene transcription and protein production. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of EGR-1 in DU145 cells dramatically decreased IL-8-mediated tumor forming and invasion. Because the majority of clinical studies confirm overexpression of IL-8 in the most advanced stages of disease, this suggests that suppressing the effects of IL-8 may have important implications for the systemic treatment of aggressive and metastatic disease. The present data, obtained from both knockdown and overexpression of EGR-1 experiments, demonstrate that EGR-1 suppresses transactivation of IL-8 via down-regulation of the IL-8 promoter in an EGR-1-dependent manner. Interfering of EGR-1 expression repressed IL-8 induction as well as EGR-1 production. Although there is no EGR-1 binding motif in the promoter of the interleukin-8 gene, EGR-1-associated IL-8 production may be regulated by other transcription factors in an indirect way. The transcriptional regulation of the IL-8 gene has been analyzed extensively at the level of the IL-8 promoter. Cis-acting elements for several transcription factors have been identified within this regulatory region (22.Moon Y. Yang H. Lee S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The factors that bind to these motifs include C/EBP, AP-1, and NF-κB. By using wild type and a series of mutant IL-8 promoter luciferase constructs, we have found that the NF-κB binding site is an important positive regulatory element for EGR-1 regulation of IL-8 (Fig. 2). It is also worthy of note that deletion of the κB site seems to be too destructive to the promoter with/without EGR-1 knockdown. By using ChIP assays, we have found the decreased binding of EGR-1 to the IL-8 promoter after treatment with shRNA-Egr-1 (Fig. 3A). Such molecular interplay between EGR-1 and NF-κB in the regulation of IL-8 is dependent on p65. We further show that EGR-1 interacts with NF-κB forming an NF-κB/EGR-1 complex, which was consistent with Cogswell et al. (23.Cogswell P.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) observations in T cell activation. Moreover, IL-8 transcription (mediated synergistically by the NF-κB and EGR-1 transcription factors) was significantly reduced by knockdown of EGR-1 in prostate carcinoma cells. Taken together, these data provided the evidence that targeting knockdown of EGR-1 resulted in the reduction of IL-8 production and IL-8-mediated tumor colony formation and invasion of prostate cancer cells through suppression of a synergistically functional interaction between EGR-1 and NF-κB. Such a model could highlight the importance of transcriptional cross-talk in IL-8-mediated prostate cancer growth and progression. EGR-1 may be the therapeutic molecular target in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells by targeting IL-8 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2032456988,"Although metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) has recently been shown as a DNA damage responsive protein, the underlying mechanism for its role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair remains unknown. Here, we show that MTA1 controls p53 stability through inhibiting its ubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligases mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2) and constitutive photomorphogenic protein 1 (COP1). The underlying mechanisms involve the ability of MTA1 to compete with COP1 to bind to p53 and/or to destabilize COP1 and Mdm2. Consequently, MTA1 regulates the p53-dependent transcription of p53R2, a direct p53 target gene for supplying nucleotides to repair damaged DNA. Depletion of MTA1 impairs p53-dependent p53R2 transcription and compromises DNA repair. Interestingly, these events could be reversed by MTA1 reintroduction, indicating that MTA1 interjects into the p53-dependent DNA repair. Given the fact that MTA1 is widely up-regulated in human cancers, these findings in conjunction with our earlier finding of a crucial role of MTA1 in DSB repair suggest an inherent role of the MTA1-p53-p53R2 pathway in DNA damage response in cancer cells.

IntroductionThe p53 tumor suppressor is a central component of cellular mechanisms that respond to DNA damage signals to preserve genomic integrity (1.Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P.

Under physiological conditions, p53 is tightly regulated and normally maintained at low levels by the action of several RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligases, including constitutive photomorphogenic protein 1 (COP1) (3.Dornan D.

Lozano G. Hakem R. Benchimol S. Cell. 2003; 112: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). All of these ligases are transcriptionally stimulated by the p53 protein and in turn, target p53 for the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, thereby creating tight negative feedback loops for controlling p53 protein stability (7.Harris S.L. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Accordingly, disruption of these autoregulatory feedback loops is a pivotal event for the activation of p53 in response to various genotoxic stresses (8.Dornan D. Shimizu H. Mah A. Dudhela T. Eby M.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Following DNA damage, p53 protein is stabilized and activated through post-translational modifications, resulting in a controlled activation of a series of downstream target genes that mediate its functions (10.Ashcroft M.

Loss of p53 function leads to decreased repair of damaged DNA and is reflected by increased sensitivity to DNA damage agents. Therefore, blocking the p53-induced DNA repair could prove to be an efficient approach to enhance the efficacy of DNA-damaging agents (18.Helleday T. Petermann E. Lundin C. Hodgson B. Sharma R.A.

Cancer. 2008; 8: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar).Recently, numerous potential mechanisms have been described as to how p53 functions to regulate DNA repair. p53 directly associates with TFIIH, a nucleotide excision repair component (19.Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Freidberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) and transactivates genes implicated in DNA repair, such as p53R2, a newly identified subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (20.Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 21.Kimura T. Takeda S. Sagiya Y. Gotoh M. Nakamura Y. Arakawa H. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The ability of p53R2 to supply nucleotides for repairing DNA damage requires the presence of a functional p53 protein, and inactivation of p53 directly interferes with the transcription of p53R2 in response to DNA damage (20.Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In function, inactivation of p53R2 impairs DNA repair and sensitizes several types of cancer cells to DNA-damaging anticancer agents or to ionizing radiation (IR) (20.Tanaka H. Arakawa H.

Thus, it is quite clear that p53 protein plays a critical role in regulating DNA repair caused by various genotoxic stresses through transcriptional induction of p53R2.The metastasis-associated protein (MTA) 2The abbreviations used are: MTAmetastasis-associated proteinDSBdouble-strand breakHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferaseqPCRquantitative PCRMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastIPimmunoprecipitation. family represents an emerging family of ubiquitously expressed chromatin modifiers, which have an integral role in the nucleosome remodeling and histone-deacetylase (NuRD) complexes (24.Denslow S.A.

Chem. 2007; 282: 1529-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The members of MTA family have been shown to interact and deacetylate non-histone proteins. For example, the MTA2- histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) complex has been shown to deacetylate p53 and represses the ability of p53 to stimulate the transcription of genes important in growth and apoptosis (26.Luo J. Su F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). However, MTA family members exist in distinct NuRD complexes, and functional redundancy is lacking among MTA family members (27.Yao Y.L. Yang W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42560-42568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). MTA1 is highly up-regulated in a variety of human cancers with metastatic potential (28.Toh Y.

Recent data suggest that MTA1 may interact with p53 (27.Yao Y.L. Yang W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42560-42568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31.Moon H.E. Cheon H. Lee M.S. Oncol. Rep. 2007; 18: 1311-1314PubMed Google Scholar), but there are conflicting reports about its effect on p53 levels with no mechanistic insights (32.Li W. Bao W. Ma J. Liu X.

Metastasis. 2005; 22: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and thus, the effect of MTA1 on p53 expression and involvement of MTA1 in p53-dependent DNA damage response remain unclear.Recent data from our laboratory suggest that MTA1 is a DNA damage responsive protein as it is stabilized in response to IR, and facilitates DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair (34.Li D.Q. Ohshiro K. Reddy S.D. Pakala S.B. Lee M.H. Zhang Y. Rayala S.K. Kumar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17493-17498Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, using a variety of genetic, biochemical, and molecular approaches, we show that MTA1 is a direct stabilizer of the p53 protein by inhibiting its ubiquitination by E3 ligases, and therefore regulates p53-dependent function in DNA repair. These findings in conjunction with our earlier finding of a crucial role of MTA1 in DSB repair suggest that MTA1 is a potential therapeutic target that could be used to enhance the effectiveness of IR or DNA-damaging anticancer agents in cancer cells by targeting MTA1 expression. IntroductionThe p53 tumor suppressor is a central component of cellular mechanisms that respond to DNA damage signals to preserve genomic integrity (1.Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P.

Under physiological conditions, p53 is tightly regulated and normally maintained at low levels by the action of several RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligases, including constitutive photomorphogenic protein 1 (COP1) (3.Dornan D. Wertz I. Shimizu H. Arnott D. Frantz G.D. Dowd P. O'Rourke K. Koeppen H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 429: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2) (4.Haupt Y.

Lozano G. Hakem R. Benchimol S. Cell. 2003; 112: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). All of these ligases are transcriptionally stimulated by the p53 protein and in turn, target p53 for the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, thereby creating tight negative feedback loops for controlling p53 protein stability (7.Harris S.L. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Accordingly, disruption of these autoregulatory feedback loops is a pivotal event for the activation of p53 in response to various genotoxic stresses (8.Dornan D. Shimizu H. Mah A. Dudhela T. Eby M.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Following DNA damage, p53 protein is stabilized and activated through post-translational modifications, resulting in a controlled activation of a series of downstream target genes that mediate its functions (10.Ashcroft M.

Loss of p53 function leads to decreased repair of damaged DNA and is reflected by increased sensitivity to DNA damage agents.

When expressed in Escherichia coli, the large (L) subunits of the Rubisco from the archaeabacterium Methanococcoides burtonii assemble into functional dimers (L(2)). However, further assembly into pentamers of L(2) (L(10)) occurs when expressed in tobacco chloroplasts or E. coli producing RuBP. In vitro analyses indicate that the sequential assembly of L(2) into L(10) (via detectable L(4) and L(6) intermediates) occurs without chaperone involvement and is stimulated by protein rearrangements associated with either the binding of substrate RuBP, the tight binding transition state analog carboxyarabinitol-1,5-bisphosphate, or inhibitory divalent metal ions within the active site. The catalytic properties of L(2) and L(10) M. burtonii Rubisco (MbR) were indistinguishable. At 25 degrees C they both shared a low specificity for CO(2) over O(2) (1.1 mol x mol(-1)) and RuBP carboxylation rates that were distinctively enhanced at low pH (approximately 4 s(-1) at pH 6, relative to 0.8 s(-1) at pH 8) with a temperature optimum of 55 degrees C. Like other archaeal Rubiscos, MbR also has a high O(2) affinity (K(m)(O(2)) = approximately 2.5 microM). The catalytic and structural similarities of MbR to other archaeal Rubiscos contrast with its closer sequence homology to bacterial L(2) Rubisco, complicating its classification within the Rubisco superfamily."

Because the systems governing circadian rhythms are important for adaptation to RF, we investigated whether Mc3rs are required for metabolic adaption to RF. Mc3r-/- mice subjected to RF exhibited normal weight loss; however, they developed hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, increased expression of lipogenic genes, and increased ketogenesis relative to controls. Rhythmic expression of transcription factors regulating liver clock activity and energy metabolism (Bmal1, Rev-erba, Pgc1, Foxo1, Hnf4a, and Pck1) was severely compromised in Mc3r-/- mice during RF. Inhibition of neural melanocortin receptors by agouti-related peptide also attenuated rhythmicity in the hepatic expression of these genes during RF.

https://openalex.org/W2000918690,"Cells that have been purified by FACS using intracellular markers are not amenable to gene expression analysis by conventional methods. Pechhold et al. solve this problem with the quantitative nuclease protection assay and apply the approach to study subsets of islet cells. Analyzing specialized cells in heterogeneous tissues is crucial for understanding organ function in health and disease. Thus far, however, there has been no convenient method for studying gene expression in cells purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using intracellular markers. Here we show that the quantitative nuclease protection assay (qNPA) enables transcriptional analysis of intracytoplasmically stained cells sorted by FACS. Applying the method to mouse pancreatic islet–cell subsets, we detected both expected and unknown lineage-specific gene expression patterns. Some beta cells from pregnant animals were found to express Mafb, previously observed only in immature beta cells during embryonic development. The four 'housekeeping' genes tested were expressed in purified islet-cell subpopulations with a notable variability, dependent on both cell lineage and developmental stage. Application of qNPA to intracellularly stained, FACS-sorted cells should be broadly applicable to the analysis of gene expression in subpopulations of any heterogeneous tissue, including tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1998770772,"In cystic fibrosis (CF), dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channel disrupts epithelial ion transport and perturbs the regulation of intracellular pH (pHi). CFTR modulates pHi through its role as an ion channel and by regulating transport proteins. However, it is unknown how CFTR senses pHi. Here, we investigate the direct effects of pHi on recombinant CFTR using excised membrane patches. By altering channel gating, acidic pHi increased the open probability (Po) of wild-type CFTR, whereas alkaline pHi decreased Po and inhibited Cl− flow through the channel. Acidic pHi potentiated the MgATP dependence of wild-type CFTR by increasing MgATP affinity and enhancing channel activity, whereas alkaline pHi inhibited the MgATP dependence of wild-type CFTR by decreasing channel activity. Because these data suggest that pHi modulates the interaction of MgATP with the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of CFTR, we examined the pHi dependence of site-directed mutations in the two ATP-binding sites of CFTR that are located at the NBD1:NBD2 dimer interface (site 1: K464A-, D572N-, and G1349D-CFTR; site 2: G551D-, K1250M-, and D1370N-CFTR). Site 2 mutants, but not site 1 mutants, perturbed both potentiation by acidic pHi and inhibition by alkaline pHi, suggesting that site 2 is a critical determinant of the pHi sensitivity of CFTR. The effects of pHi also suggest that site 2 might employ substrate-assisted catalysis to ensure that ATP hydrolysis follows NBD dimerization. We conclude that the CFTR Cl− channel senses directly pHi. The direct regulation of CFTR by pHi has important implications for the regulation of epithelial ion transport.

HS biosynthetic enzymes do not act upon every potential site within a chain, resulting in chains with a high level of structural diversity and a distinct domain structure, with regions of unmodified saccharides (N-acetyl domains) and highly modified saccharides (N-sulfated domains) flanked by regions of alternating modified and unmodified disaccharides (transition or N-acetyl/N-sulfated domains) (1.Turnbull J.E.

HS chains are usually attached to core proteins, forming HS proteoglycans, and these proteoglycans represent one of the major components of most metazoan cell surfaces and extracellular matrices. Here, they control cell-cell and cell-matrix communication by association with a large repertoire of regulatory proteins (5.Ori A. Wilkinson M.C. Fernig D.G. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 4309-4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), including growth factors, morphogens, extracellular matrix components, enzymes, cell adhesion molecules, and cytokines. It is through these interactions with proteins that HS exerts its role in numerous biological processes during embryogenesis, development, and adult homeostasis, largely by regulating transport and/or effector functions of its protein ligands. heparan sulfate single chain variable fragment vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein horseradish peroxidase porcine mucosal heparan sulfate heavy chain variable domain light chain variable domain complementarity determining region degree of polymerization bovine serum albumin embryonic day n phosphate-buffered saline. The structure of HS is dynamic and is directed by the cellular environment and physiology, i.e. tissue/cell type, state of differentiation and growth, and pathology. Distinct cellular sources have been shown to display a range of HS chain lengths, domain structures, and sulfation (1.Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem.

Native HS is therefore highly diverse, with each cell synthesizing an array of HS chains of different lengths and structures with a variety of modifications and chain domain organization. HS should therefore not be classed as a single entity but rather as a family of structurally related but highly diverse molecules with a range of functional effects. The mechanisms regulating HS biosynthesis and the resulting structure of HS are poorly understood; thus, the precise composition of native chains is difficult to establish. Nucleic acids can be amplified and quantified by PCR and localized by in situ hybridization; there are no such methods for analyzing the minute quantities of HS structures in a tissue. Tissue HS is usually structurally analyzed following extraction and purification; the inherent averaging of this approach, however, limits the information to the overall assessment of mixed populations of HS structures and the loss of all spatial information. Monoclonal antibodies directed toward glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate and keratan sulfate are available that enable the localization of specific glycosaminoglycan epitopes to be identified in tissues (11.Caterson B.

To circumvent the difficulties of analyzing tissue HS in situ, HS-specific single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies have been generated by phage display technology, which enables the detection of HS glycosaminoglycan structures in situ (22.van Kuppevelt T.H.

However, their application is complicated by the fact that they are raised against heterogeneous native heparin and HS chains, and consequently the exact structures they recognize within the polysaccharide are unknown. This hinders further application of the antibodies and interpretation of tissue staining patterns. To gain insights into the specificity of these valuable analytical tools, the binding characteristics and epitope structures recognized by a panel of six scFv HS antibodies were examined. Antibody epitopes were probed in situ using immunohistochemistry and dot blotting of embryonic rat lungs, because the development of the lung represents one of the core models of mammalian organogenesis, and its functional transition postpartum is a key event in mammalian physiology. In addition, modeling of the antibody structures and competition binding assays with various heparin analogues were used to determine antibody binding specificities in vitro. The results show that HS phage display antibodies all share a similar, largely basic structure and recognize distinct HS epitopes that are structurally complex. Analysis of antibody binding specificities also provides valuable information on the specificity of HS-protein interactions in general.

Maxisorp 96-well microtiter plates were purchased from Nunc (Fisher), and o-phenylenediamine (o-phenylenediamine substrate) was from Dako Ltd. (Ely, UK). Lungs from Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Ltd, Margate, UK) were harvested at embryonic days (E) 15.5 and 17.5 of gestation and fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. The lungs were washed in PBS, cryoprotected with 20% (w/v) sucrose in PBS, and gelatin-embedded (7.5% (w/v) gelatin, 15% (w/v) sucrose in PBS) before being covered in Cryo-M-Bed (Bright, Huntingdon, UK) and snap frozen at −40 °C. The lung sections were cut at 8 μm and mounted onto chrome alum gel slides for storage at −40 °C. Tissue sections were blocked with 10% (v/v) goat serum in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with HS scFv antibodies, diluted 1/5 in 1% (v/v) goat serum in PBS. Bound antibody was detected with rabbit VSV-G tag antibody diluted 1/200 in 1% (v/v) goat serum in PBS, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The controls were omission of HS antibody or treatment of tissue sections with heparinase III (EC 4.2.2.8) (5 milliunits/ml in 100 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 mm calcium acetate, 50 μg/ml BSA, pH 7.0) for 2 h at 37 °C, prior to antibody incubation to remove HS epitopes. Lungs from Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River) were harvested at E15.5, E17.5, E19.5, and E21.5 of gestation and immediately homogenized on ice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2% (w/v) SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/10 ml buffer). Because earlier gestation stage lungs are smaller, a higher number of E15.5 lungs were used to prepare lung extract samples compared with E21.5 lungs. This ensured similar ratios of tissue weight:volume homogenization buffer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and supernatants were collected. Each supernatant was then standardized for protein concentration. Lung extracts (10 μl) were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 0.6% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in PBS. The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST). HS antibodies were diluted 1/10 in 5% (w/v) milk in PBST, and the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Bound antibodies were detected with mouse anti-His tag IgG, diluted 1/20,000 followed by HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG, diluted 1/2000. After washes in PBST and finally PBS, the membranes were incubation in SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate for 5 min and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL. The controls were omission of HS antibody, omission of HS antibody, and anti-His tag antibody or treatment of lung extracts with heparinase I, II, and III (all 5 milliunits/200 μl of extract in 100 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 mm calcium acetate, 50 μg/ml BSA, pH 7.0) for 4 h at 37 °C to remove epitopes prior to blotting lung extract. Antibody light and heavy chain sequences were aligned with known sequences and submitted to web antibody modeling, an online resource hosted by The Centre for Protein Analysis and Design at the University of Bath. This is specifically tailored to construct three-dimensional models of antibody Fv sequences. The resulting models were then viewed in a Swiss-PDB viewer. N-Hydroxysuccinimide amino caproate biotin (NHS-LC-biotin) (25 μl of a 50 mm solution in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to 5 mg of PMHS in 500 μl of distilled water and allowed to react overnight at room temperature. A further 25 μl of NHS-LC-biotin was added after this time. Biotinylated polysaccharide was separated from unconjugated biotin on a Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column, with the absorbance monitored at 280 nm to identify fractions containing biotinylated HS. In this way, PMHS was biotinylated internally within the polysaccharide chain at rare N-unsubstituted glucosamines. PMHS is estimated to contain ∼1.2–7.5% free amines (34.Toida T. Yoshida H. Toyoda H. Koshiishi I. Imanari T. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), equating to 1–2 biotinylation sites/HS chain; thus, attachment to microtitre plates will be made at a restricted number of sites/chain. Three μg/ml streptavidin in 0.1 m Na2CO3HCO3 (pH 9.6) was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C in Maxisorp 96-well microtiter plates. The plates were blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, washed with PBST (0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), and then incubated with biotinylated PMHS (75 μg/ml) in 1% (w/v) BSA, PBST for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were washed with PBST, and 15 μl of antibody was added to wells with 15 μl of competitor saccharide (heparin dp2–dp20 oligosaccharides or chemically modified heparins) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The antibody dilutions were determined in a titer and were used at final concentrations of; HS3B7V 1/5, HS4E4V 1/15, HS3A8V 1/20, AO4B08V 1/15, EV3C3V 1/15, and EW4G1V 1/2. Competitor saccharides (10 mg/ml in distilled water) were diluted in 2% BSA in PBST (0.1% Tween 20) to the required concentrations. For the positive control, antibody was added to wells with 2% BSA in PBST without competitor saccharide. The plates were washed in PBST and incubated with mouse anti-VSV-G IgG, clone P5D4, diluted 1/100 for 1 h, followed by HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG, diluted 1/1000. After washing in PBST, the plates were developed with o-phenylenediamine substrate, and A490 values were measured using a microtiter plate reader. Six antibodies were chosen on the basis that they had been raised against HS/heparin from a variety of tissue sources and encompassed a broad spectrum of antibody structures. Their selection contained two pairs of antibodies that shared an identical framework structure and therefore only differed in the VH CDR3 sequence (HS4E4V/HS3A8V and EV3C3V/EW4G1V). The two remaining antibodies had distinct framework structures and unique VH CDR3 sequences (Table 1).TABLE 1HS phage display antibodiesCloneVHDPCDR3Selected againstRef.HS3B7V13SRKTRKPFMRKBovine kidney HS24.Dennissen M.A. Jenniskens G.J.

All of the antibodies showed strong immunoreactivity to airway epithelial basement membranes; one antibody, HS3B7V, exclusively labeled epithelial basement membranes in the lungs and failed to stain mesenchymal or epithelial cells (Fig. 1C, panel 2). HS3A8V and EV3C3V showed similar patterns of immunohistochemistry in E15.5 rat lungs, labeling airway epithelium, underlying basement membranes and the surrounding mesenchyme (Fig. 1A, panels 1 and 2). However, at E17.5, staining by these two antibodies differed, most notably in the lung mesenchyme; HS3A8V staining remained strong throughout the mesenchyme (Fig. 1B, panel 1), whereas a gradient of mesenchymal EV3C3V staining was observed, with the highest levels of immunoreactivity around the smaller developing airways (Fig. 1B, panel 2). EW4G1V and AO4B08V also demonstrated equivalent patterns of staining in E15.5 rat lungs, both showing strong labeling of epithelial basement membranes and weak labeling of the surrounding mesenchyme (Fig. 1A, panels 3 and 4). In E17.5 lungs, however, staining with the two antibodies was distinct; EW4G1V mesenchymal staining remained weak (Fig. 1B, panel 3), whereas AO4B08V mesenchymal staining increased significantly (Fig. 1B, panel 4). The final antibody, HS4E4V showed a unique pattern of immunoreactivity in E15.5 lungs, labeling epithelial basement membranes and areas of mesenchyme surrounding smaller distal airways (Fig. 1C, panel 1). Immunohistochemical analysis of antibody binding specificities thus indicated unique HS epitope expression. To gain further biochemical insight into the expression of antibody-binding sites, we examined the presence of epitopes biochemically by dot blotting tissue extracts from developing rat lungs and probing with HS antibodies. In many cases the epitopes were identified in lung extracts at varying levels during development that correlated with the relevant immunochemistry data. Surprisingly, however, one antibody, HS4C3V, failed to label developing rat lungs in situ (data not shown), whereas the epitope was clearly identified in vitro in dot blotted lung extracts (Fig. 2). In addition, alongside the major difference in recognition of the HS4C3V epitope, a number of more subtle discrepancies between the in situ and in vitro detection of epitopes were observed. Levels of the AO4B08V epitope were high in E15.5 lung extracts and increased further in E17.5 extracts (Fig. 2), whereas in situ the epitope was present at a low level at E15.5 and significantly increased in E17.5 lungs (Fig. 1, A and B, panels 4). Conversely, EV3C3V epitope levels observed in dot blots were very low at E15.5 and increased significantly at E17.5 (Fig. 2), whereas in situ the epitope was present at a consistently high level throughout development (Fig. 1, A and B, panels 2). These observations are significant, as they highlight an important difference between the presence and availability of epitopes in a native environment in situ compared with an in vitro environment, i.e. in tissue extracts. In the latter, HS chains may be stripped of the majority of their protein partners (e.g. because of detergent in homogenization buffer), whereas in situ, bound proteins could be associated with HS chains and modify antibody binding. The antibodies consisted of a heavy chain (VH) and a light chain variable domain (VL), which are connected by a polypeptide linker. Within both of these domains were three hypervariable regions, termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which form the antigen-binding site. All of the antibodies shared an identical VL chain but showed differences in their VH chains. Two pairs of antibodies, HS4E4V/ HS3A8V and EV3C3V/EW4G1V, were encoded by identical gene segments belonging to the VH3 gene family, and consequently, their amino acid sequences were identical apart from their CDR3 (Table 1). AO4B08V was encoded by a different gene segment (DP47) of the VH3 gene family, resulting in minor variations in the heavy chain amino acid sequence, as well as a unique CDR3 (Table 1). HS3B7V was distinct from the other antibodies, originating from a different VH gene family altogether (VH1), resulting in a more diverse heavy chain sequence and more obvious variations in structure and surface electrostatic potential compared with the other five antibodies. The surface electrostatic potentials of the antibodies have not been examined before and were therefore modeled here. Modeling revealed a large basic area on the surface of all antibodies, expected to be a significant mediator of interactions with polyanionic heparin/HS (Figs. 3a and 4 and supplemental Figs. S1–S4). However, the large area of basic residues dominating the surface of the antibodies clearly provided more than one possibility for the binding orientation of HS. Measurement of the potential binding axes for heparin/HS revealed that lengths of between 2 and 4 nm can be accommodated (Figs. 3 and 4 and supplemental Figs. S1–S4), corresponding to a dp4–dp10 heparin/HS sequence, because a disaccharide measured ∼0.8 nm in length (35.Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Jones C. Davies D.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Interestingly, on the surface of HS3B7V, however, the basic patch was comparatively smaller than the other antibodies, and there was also a higher proportion of acidic regions on its surface (Fig. 4). The binding axis for heparin/HS would, therefore, be expected to be more restricted in this case than with the other antibodies.FIGURE 4Proposed model and surface electrostatic potential of HS3B7V from four perspectives. Two possible HS binding axes and their lengths are shown. Note the smaller proportion of basic residues and higher number of acidic patches on the surface of this antibody compared with the others (Compare with HS4E4V in Fig. 2 and other antibodies described in supplemental Figs. S1–S4).

Chemically modified heparin oligosaccharides were used as model binding competitors, because their sulfation patterns are virtually homogeneous, and they have been structurally characterized (36.Yates E.A.

https://openalex.org/W2030516172,"Abnormal transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling is a critical contributor to the pathogenesis of various human diseases ranging from tissue fibrosis to tumor formation. Excessive TGF-β signaling stimulates fibrotic responses. Recent research has focused in the main on the antiproliferative effects of TGF-β in fibroblasts, and it is presently understood that TGF-β-stimulated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induction in fibroblasts is essential for antifibroproliferative effects of TGF-β. Both TGF-β and COX-2 have been implicated in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis, and therefore tumor-associated fibroblasts are a recent topic of interest. Here we report the identification of positive and negative regulatory factors of COX-2 expression induced by TGF-β as determined using proteomic approaches. We show that TGF-β coordinately up-regulates three factors, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B (HNRPAB), nucleotide diphosphate kinase A (NDPK A), and nucleotide diphosphate kinase A (NDPK B). Functional pathway analysis showed that HNRPAB augments mRNA and protein levels of COX-2 and subsequent prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) production by suppressing degradation of COX-2 mRNA.

https://openalex.org/W2130912742,"The catalytic (C) and regulatory (R) subunits of protein kinase A are exceptionally dynamic proteins. Interactions between the R- and C-subunits are regulated by cAMP binding to the two cyclic nucleotide-binding domains in the R-subunit. Mammalian cells express four different isoforms of the R-subunit (RIalpha, RIbeta, RIIalpha, and RIIbeta) that all interact with the C-subunit in different ways. Here, we investigate the dynamic behavior of protein complexes between RIalpha and C-subunits using small angle x-ray scattering. We show that a single point mutation in RIalpha, R333K (which alters the cAMP-binding properties of Domain B) results in a compact shape compared with the extended shape of the wild-type R.C complex. A double mutant complex that disrupts the interaction site between the C-subunit and Domain B in RIalpha, RIalpha(AB)R333K.C(K285P), results in a broader P(r) curve that more closely resembles the P(r) profiles of wild-type complexes. These results together suggest that interactions between RIalpha Domain B and the C-subunit in the RIalpha.C complex involve large scale dynamics that can be disrupted by single point mutations in both proteins. In contrast to RIalpha.C complexes. Domain B in the RIIbeta.C heterodimer is not dynamic and is critical for both inhibition and complex formation. Our study highlights the functional differences of domain dynamics between protein kinase A isoforms, providing a framework for elucidating the global organization of each holoenzyme and the cross-talk between the R- and C-subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1986427206,"Cytoplasmic dynein is a complex containing heavy chains (HCs), intermediate chains (ICs), light intermediate chains (LICs), and light chains (LCs). The HCs are responsible for motor activity. The ICs at the tail region of the motor interact with dynactin, which is essential for dynein function. However, functions of other subunits and how they contribute to the assembly of the core complex are not clearly defined. Here, we analyzed in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans functions of the only LIC and two LCs, RobA (Roadblock/LC7) and TctexA (Tctex1) in dynein-mediated nuclear distribution (nud). Whereas the deletion mutant of tctexA did not exhibit an apparent nud mutant phenotype, the deletion mutant of robA exhibited a nud phenotype at an elevated temperature, which is similar to the previously characterized nudG (LC8) deletion mutant. Remarkably, in contrast to the single mutants, the robA and nudG double deletion mutant exhibits a severe nud phenotype at various temperatures. Thus, functions of these two LC classes overlap to some extent, but the presence of both becomes important under specific conditions. The single LIC, however, is essential for dynein function in nuclear distribution. This is evidenced by the identification of the nudN gene as the LIC coding gene, and by the nud phenotype exhibited by the LIC down-regulating mutant, alcA-LIC. Without a functional LIC, the HC-IC association is significantly weakened, and the HCs could no longer accumulate at the microtubule plus end. Thus, the LIC is essential for the assembly of the core complex of dynein in Aspergillus."

However, none of the LeuT structures indicates the location of the permeation pathway leading from the binding site to the cytoplasm.Studies employing cysteine scanning mutagenesis of serotonin transporter (SERT) identified a potential permeation pathway leading from the binding site to the cytoplasm, composed of TMs 1, 5, 6, and 8 (12.Zhang Y.W.

Chem. 2007; 282: 29441-29447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).We generated a model of LeuT in a cytoplasm-facing conformation that was consistent with accessibility information from the cysteine scanning studies (13.Forrest L.R.

LeuT could interconvert between conformations represented by the crystal structures and the cytoplasm-facing model by tilting or rocking of a 4-helix bundle composed of TMs 1, 2, 6, and 7 within a scaffold formed by the rest of the protein. We proposed that this “rocking bundle” mechanism could account for alternating access in the neurotransmitter: sodium symporter transporter family (13.Forrest L.R. Zhang Y.W. Jacobs M.T. Gesmonde J. Xie L. Honig B.H. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10338-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar).These accessibility changes are consistent with cocaine stabilizing conformations of SERT similar to those of the LeuT crystal structures (with the bundle tilted so as to open the extracellular pathway and close the cytoplasmic pathway). A model was recently proposed for cocaine binding to dopamine transporter in a conformation similar to that of the occluded LeuT crystal structure (17.Beuming T. Kniazeff J. Bergmann M.L. Shi L. Gracia L. Raniszewska K. Newman A.H. Javitch J.A. Weinstein H. Gether U. Loland C.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Ibogaine is expected to stabilize a conformation more like the cytoplasm-facing model of LeuT (with the bundle tilted so as to close the extracellular pathway and open the cytoplasmic one).Information about proximity between residues within a polypeptide can be obtained by site-directed cross-linking experiments (18.Falke J.J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1987; 237: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 19.Pakula A.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In the homologous γ-aminobutyric acid transporter GAT-1, an interaction between TM1 and TM3 was proposed based on paired cysteine mutagenesis and cross-linking (22.Zomot E. Zhou Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25512-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In a mutant containing cysteines at positions 68 and 143, transport was sensitive to inhibition by Cd2+ and copper(II)(1,10-phenanthroline)3 (CuPh3), which can chelate or cross-link, respectively, two cysteine thiol groups. Cross-linking by CuPh3 was not shown chemically but only by inhibition of transport activity (22.Zomot E. Zhou Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25512-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Detection of cross-linking events in membrane proteins has been challenging. In other systems, where disulfide cross-links were formed between polypeptide chains, detection by a change in mobility on SDS-PAGE was sufficient (21.Wu J. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 14498-14502Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Alternatively, protease-sensitive sites have been inserted into proteins to allow cleavage into peptides that would separate on SDS-PAGE unless cross-linked (23.Sun J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11959-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, to be useful, these sites must be inserted in locations where they are accessible to the specific protease and also do not interfere with protein function, requirements that may be difficult to satisfy. In this study, we employed a novel strategy of methionine mutagenesis to generate specific cleavage sites for cyanogen bromide.According to our analysis of LeuT (13.Forrest L.R. Zhang Y.W. Jacobs M.T. Gesmonde J. Xie L. Honig B.H. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10338-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), cysteine cross-linking between Cys-68 and Cys-143 in GAT-1 represented disulfide formation between the 4-helix bundle and the scaffold comprising the remainder of the protein. We reasoned that the distance between these positions might change with the bundle orientation, and might be affected by binding of specific ligands that affect transporter conformation. Accordingly, we tested the corresponding positions in SERT, where cocaine and ibogaine are known to have different effects on protein conformation.DISCUSSIONProtein conformational changes are thought to underlie the alternate exposure of binding sites to opposite sides of the membrane during transport (31.Jardetzky O. Nature. 1966; 211: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 32.Mitchell P. Res. Microbiol. 1990; 141: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We recently proposed a conformational mechanism for alternating access in the neurotransmitter transporter family (13.Forrest L.R. Zhang Y.W. Jacobs M.T. Gesmonde J. Xie L. Honig B.H. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10338-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This mechanism proposed that tilting or rocking of a 4-helix bundle composed of TM helices 1, 2, 6, and 7 within a scaffold formed by the rest of the protein accomplished these accessibility changes. In the work described here, we provide additional experimental evidence in favor of that mechanism.In the original LeuT crystal structure, proposed as a model for neurotransmitter transporter structure (3.Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar), the α-carbons of Leu-29 in TM1 and Ile-111 in TM3 are situated 10.6 Å from each other (Fig. 8) and ∼10 Å closer to the extracellular medium than the bound leucine molecule. In this structure, the bound leucine at the substrate site was occluded from both sides of the membrane. A more recent LeuT structure with tryptophan bound was presented as a possible model for the conformation of the transporter with the substrate site exposed to the extracellular medium (7.Singh S.K. Piscitelli C.L. Yamashita A. Gouaux E. Science. 2008; 322: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In this “open-out” structure, the C-α positions of the same two residues were 13.6 Å apart (Fig. 8). In the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter GAT-1, Kanner and co-workers (22.Zomot E. Zhou Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25512-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) found that when both of the corresponding residues were replaced with cysteine, transport activity became sensitive to the sulfhydryl oxidizing agent CuPh3, and suggested that this inhibition resulted from disulfide formation between the two transmembrane helices. The C-α positions in the extended conformation of cystine are only 7.3 Å apart, significantly closer than the corresponding residues in either LeuT structure. Thus, CuPh3 inactivation of GAT-1 either occurred by another mechanism, or a conformational change was required to bring the two cysteine residues together.In the work presented here, we show that cysteine residues at the two corresponding positions in SERT led to chemical cross-linking between TM1 and TM3 (Fig. 3). This observation was facilitated by judicious mutation of methionine residues in SERT to create a background in which a single methionine in TM2 provided a CNBr cleavage site between the two reactive cysteine residues. We propose this method as a new application of CNBr cleavage to identify cross-linking reactions in proteins, especially in cases where the cross-linking event does not lead to a measurable change in activity.The presence of cysteine at positions 103 and 179 was required for efficient CuPh3 inactivation (Figs. 2 and 4) and cross-linking (Fig. 3). However, the effect of CuPh3 on cross-linking was not visible in Fig. 3, and the extent of cross-linking was not measurably sensitive to ligand binding, although inactivation was dependent on CuPh3 (Figs. 2 and 4) and blocked by inhibitors (Figs. 4 and 7). The inability to detect a CuPh3 effect by CNBr cleavage may reflect the high extent of spontaneous cross-linking. Proteins destined for surface expression are subject to spontaneous disulfide oxidation in the endoplasmic reticulum (33.Frand A.R. Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 203-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We surmise that only a minor fraction of SERT expressed in these cells catalyzed 5-HT influx, and was sensitive to oxidation by CuPh3, whereas the majority of cell surface SERT was cross-linked during biosynthesis.From our results with CNBr cleavage, we conclude that, at least in this system, the technique is useful to identify a pair of cysteine residues that are close enough to form a disulfide. However, we found that for determining the time course of cross-linking or measuring the effect of ligands on the process, it was more useful to follow changes in activity that accompanied the reaction.The W103C mutant was weakly inactivated by CuPh3 (Figs. 2 and 5) and showed some evidence of cross-linking as indicated by the occasional formation of a minor DTT-sensitive band (supplemental Fig. S1). The corresponding mutant in GAT-1 also showed some sensitivity to CuPh3 (22.Zomot E. Zhou Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25512-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is not clear what this cross-linking and CuPh3 sensitivity represent, although it is likely to be a different process from that observed with X3M2C. The mobility of the occasionally observed W103C cross-linked product was higher than with X3M2C, and cocaine, which blocked CuPh3 inactivation of X3M2C (Fig. 4), had no effect on W103C (Fig. 5). Whatever process was responsible for the reactivity of W103C, it is likely to represent a common feature of SERT and GAT-1. It is not clear why only W103C and not I179C was sensitive to inactivation and cross-linking by CuPh3. However, as part of the mobile 4-helix bundle, position 103 might have more access to other cysteine residues in SERT or adjacent proteins.In our proposed mechanism for alternating access in this family, the outer half of the bundle, including TM1, tilts toward the scaffold, including TM3, as the extracellular permeation pathway closes (13.Forrest L.R. Zhang Y.W. Jacobs M.T. Gesmonde J. Xie L. Honig B.H. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10338-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). At the same time, the cytoplasmic half of the bundle tilts away from the scaffold, exposing the cytoplasmic permeation pathway. In our model, the distance between the α-carbons of Leu-29 and Ile-111 in the cytoplasm-facing conformation is only 5.5 Å, well within the distance required to form a disulfide between cysteines at the corresponding positions in GAT-1 and SERT (Fig. 8). Disulfide formation, therefore, would be facilitated by the conformational change that we proposed to interconvert these transporters from their open-out to cytoplasm-facing conformations. Moreover, covalent linkage of the corresponding positions in TMs 1 and 3 of GAT-1 and SERT would be expected to block transport by preventing the conformational change leading to the occluded or open-out conformations.To provide further support for this interpretation, we utilized cocaine and ibogaine, two inhibitors that apparently stabilize different conformations of SERT. Using the reactivity of cysteine residues placed in the cytoplasmic permeation pathway, we previously showed that cocaine closed that pathway and ibogaine opened it (12.Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14.Jacobs M.T. Zhang Y.W. Campbell S.D. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29441-29447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). At the same time, cocaine increased exposure, and ibogaine decreased exposure, of cysteine residues placed in the extracellular permeation pathway, consistent with a concerted conformational change resulting from tilting of the 4-helix bundle (14.Jacobs M.T. Zhang Y.W. Campbell S.D. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29441-29447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15.Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Fig. 4 shows that cocaine blocked the ability of CuPh3 to inactivate the SERT double cysteine mutant X3M2C, as expected if cocaine binding restricted SERT to conformations similar to the occluded or open-out structures of LeuT (Fig. 8). The effect of cocaine was not simply due to steric occlusion of the cysteine residues at positions 103 and 179, because the single cysteine replacement mutants were either equally (W103C, supplemental Fig. S2) or more sensitive (I179C, Fig. 7) to inactivation by MTSEA in the presence of cocaine. The increased accessibility of I179C is likely due to cocaine stabilizing the extracellular-facing conformation of SERT. We previously showed that cocaine also increased accessibility of the corresponding residue in norepinephrine transporter (15.Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Other inhibitors, imipramine, fluoxetine, and citalopram (all antidepressant drugs that inhibit SERT by binding from the cell exterior), also protected SERT X3M2C from inactivation by CuPh3 (Fig. 6). In contrast, the transported substrates 5-HT and MDMA had little effect on inactivation. Ibogaine was the only inhibitor that did not significantly protect against CuPh3.We interpret these results in the context of a conformational change associated with transport that brings positions 103 and 179 into close proximity. In the absence of ligands, the conformational flexibility of the transporter is high enough that the rate-limiting factor in cross-link formation is the rate of oxidation, itself dependent on CuPh3 concentration (Figs. 2 and 4B), rather than the proportion of SERT in a cross-linkable conformation. The presence of substrates (5-HT or MDMA) initiates catalytic cycling of the transporter, but does not inhibit cross-linking because intermediate conformations during transport also favor cross-linking. However, inhibitors such as cocaine and antidepressants bind to and stabilize SERT conformations in which positions 103 and 179 are separated enough not to cross-link (Figs. 4 and 6) and are accessible to MTSEA (Figs. 7 and supplemental S2).Ibogaine, despite being a SERT inhibitor, did not inhibit CuPh3-dependent inactivation to the extent observed with other inhibitors. Compared with cocaine, ibogaine was less than 10% as effective at decreasing the sensitivity to CuPh3 (Fig. 4B) although both inhibitors were present at concentrations 5-fold higher than their IC50. Ibogaine apparently stabilizes a conformation of SERT different from that favored by other inhibitors. Thus, we conclude that when ibogaine is bound, SERT is in a conformation closer to that of the cytoplasm-facing intermediate, in which positions 103 and 179 are in close proximity. The observation that ibogaine slightly inhibited the rate of CuPh3-mediated inactivation relative to no addition suggests that the two cysteine residues at 103 and 179 may not be as close in the ibogaine-bound state as in the cytoplasm-facing conformation, or that the orientation of their sulfhydryl groups are constrained by ibogaine in a way that impedes their oxidation to cystine. Our model of the cytoplasm-facing conformation of LeuT (13.Forrest L.R. Zhang Y.W. Jacobs M.T. Gesmonde J. Xie L. Honig B.H. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10338-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) is not sufficiently accurate to predict the orientation of these residues in SERT, and we also do not know how closely the cytoplasm-facing conformation of SERT resembles the conformation with ibogaine bound.The results presented here are consistent with a mechanism in which the extracellular half of the 4-helix bundle containing TM1 moves toward TM3 in the scaffold when the transporter is in the cytoplasm-facing conformation. Cocaine binding is proposed to block this movement and in our current results also prevented inactivation due to cross-linking. We anticipate that future structural and biochemical studies will provide further support for the rocking bundle mechanism.

However, none of the LeuT structures indicates the location of the permeation pathway leading from the binding site to the cytoplasm.Studies employing cysteine scanning mutagenesis of serotonin transporter (SERT) identified a potential permeation pathway leading from the binding site to the cytoplasm, composed of TMs 1, 5, 6, and 8 (12.Zhang Y.W.

We previously reported that the expression of the transcription factor NFAT2 (NFATc1) induced by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) is essential for the formation of multinucleated cells.

Here we searched for serine analogs that antagonize the function of l-Ser and suppress the formation of osteoclasts in bone marrow as well as RAW264 cells. An analog thus identified, H-Ser(tBu)-OMe·HCl, appeared to suppress the production of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine by serine palmitoyltransferase, and the expression and localization of RANK, a cognate receptor of RANKL, in membrane lipid rafts was down-regulated in the analog-treated cells.

It is well established that receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) plays a central role in osteoclastogenesis through its cognate receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) (3.Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S.

We previously found, using an in vitro model of osteoclastogenesis consisting of mouse cells and recombinant RANKL, that the expression of the transcription factor NFAT2 (NFATc1) induced by stimulation with RANKL is essential for the formation of mature osteoclasts (5.Ishida N.

Subsequently, a high cell density was found to cause a change in the composition/state of the culture medium accompanying down-regulation of NFAT2 expression, and we eventually identified l-Ser as a key component for the phenomenon (6.Ogawa T.

Although the differentiation medium contained seven nonessential amino acids (l-Ala, l-Asn, l-Asp, l-Glu, l-Gly, l-Pro, and l-Ser), no other amino acid showed such a characteristic property. In fact, no osteoclasts formed when only l-Ser was depleted from the differentiation medium with dialyzed serum. In this regard, d-Ser was completely inert, and moreover, when d-Ser was added together with l-Ser, there was a suppressive effect on NFAT2 expression/osteoclastic formation, implying certain analog(s) to be useful for suppressing osteoclastogenesis through the down-regulation of NFAT2 expression. Unfortunately, however, d-Ser had a toxic effect in RAW264 cells. multinucleated 3-ketodihydrosphingosine serine palmitoyltransferase lactosylceramide fetal bovine serum glutathione S-transferase extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. Here we systematically searched for analogs with more effective suppressive activity and less toxicity. We consequently identified a novel serine analog, H-Ser(tBu)-OMe·HCl (or O- t.-Butyl-l-serine methyl ester hydrochloride), that suppressed osteoclastogenesis in vitro by down-regulating RANK expression as well as its localization in membrane lipid rafts and the subsequent RANKL/RANK signaling cascade. The analog appeared to inhibit the production of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (KDS) by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), and the addition of lactosylceramide (LacCer) rescued the osteoclastic formation. The analysis using the analog thus shed light on the significance of serine metabolism through SPT in osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, this effect was confirmed in vivo; namely, administration of the analog appeared to increase bone density in control mice and to prevent high bone turnover in soluble RANKL-treated mice. Therefore, the findings may be useful for developing a novel therapeutic tool for bone diseases such as osteoporosis, which is known to be accelerated by enhanced bone resorbing activity and/or the formation of osteoclasts. The significance of the findings is discussed. RAW264 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm l-glutamine (Nissui), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). GST-RANKL was prepared as described previously (5.Ishida N. Hayashi K. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Koga S. Miyatake Y. Kumegawa M. Kimura T. Takeya T. J. Biol.

Rabbit anti-ERK, anti-pERK, anti-p38, and anti-phosphop38 were from Promega and Cell Signaling Technology, respectively. Anti-RANK antibody (sc-9072), anti-NFAT2 monoclonal antibody (sc-7294), and anti-c-Fos (sc-52) rabbit polyclonal antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A were purchased from GE Healthcare UK Ltd. FB1 and myriocin were obtained from Calbiochem. LacCer and H-Ser(tBu)-OMe·HCl were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Merck, respectively. The cytotoxicity of d-Ser or analog was assessed with a WST-8 assay kit (TAKARA BIO, Shiga, Japan). The cells were incubated in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in triplicate in the presence of increasingly higher concentrations of d-Ser or the analog. After 72 h, 10 μl of the solution provided with WST-8 was added to each well, and the cells were cultured for another 2 h. The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm. For examining osteoclastogenesis in vitro, either RAW264 cells or bone marrow macrophages were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml and incubated for 24 h. Purified GST-RANKL or GST, prepared as described (5.Ishida N. Hayashi K. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Koga S. Miyatake Y. Kumegawa M. Kimura T. Takeya T. J. Biol.

In brief, bone marrow cells were collected by flushing the femurs and tibias of 6–8-week old wild-type mice with α-minimum essential medium (Invitrogen), and red blood cells were removed by treatment with ammonium chloride solution. After being washed, the cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% conditioned medium of NIH3T3/pCAhMCSF cells (macrophage colony-stimulating factor conditioned medium) (6.Ogawa T.

After 12–16 h, nonadherent cells were collected and cultured a further 1–3 days in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 3% macrophage colony-stimulating factor conditioned medium. The cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, and 100 KIU/ml aprotinin. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were carried out essentially as described using protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare Bioscience KK, Tokyo, Japan). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, MA), and detected by Western blotting using Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore). This was essentially performed as reported (8.Ha H. Kwak H.B. Lee S.K. Na D.S. Rudd C.E. Lee Z.H. Kim H.H. J. Biol.

We tested ∼100 types of l-serine analogs including dipeptides. Substances that either caused cell death or showed osteoclast inducing activity were eliminated at the first screening. The candidates were then added at concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 10 mm to the in vitro osteoclastogenesis system as described above, and the numbers of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells formed were counted after 4 days. Test substances were administered intraperitoneally to a group of female mice (n = 5). The dose levels were selected in such a way that 0–100% of the animals would die. The LD50 with 95% confidence limits and function was determined as described (9.Akhila J. Deepa S. Alwar M. Curr. Sci. 2007; 93: 917-920Google Scholar).

Female C57BL/6JJc1 mice, aged 7 weeks, were intraperitoneally injected with 100 μg of GST or GST-RANKL three times at intervals of 24 h. The l-Ser analog (analog 290) was injected twice a day with the first injection 1 h before the GST-RANKL treatment, and the second injection was 8 h after the first. One day after the last injection, all of the mice were sacrificed and subjected to pQCT and micro-CT analyses. Right tibiae were dissected out from 6–8-week old female mice of vehicle-, RANKL-, or analog 290-treated mice and stored in 70% ethanol. The imaging of proximal metaphyses of the tibiae was performed by micro focus x-ray computed tomography (Scan X-mate; Comscan Techno). Three-dimensional micro-CT images were analyzed and quantified using TRI/3D-BON image analysis software (Ratoc System Engineering). Histomorphometric parameters on proximal metaphyses of left tibiae were measured at the Ito Bone Histomorphometry Institute (Niigata, Japan) and described according to the nomenclature system (12.Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4921) Google Scholar). The right tibiae were dissected out from mice to be examined as described above and stored in 70% ethanol. The proximal metaphysis and midshaft of each tibial sample were scanned with a peripheral quantitative computer tomography (pQCT) system (XCT Research SA; Norland Stratec Medizintechnik GmbH). The growth cartilage at the distal epiphysis of the tibia was used as a reference line, and two sites, at 1 and 7 mm medial to the line, were selected as the point of the analysis for trabecular BMD and cortical BMD, respectively. The following set-up was used for the measurement; voxel size = 0.08 mm, slice thickness = 0.46 mm, contour mode = 2, peel mode = 2, inner threshold for trabecular bone analysis = 395 mg/cm3, cortical mode = 1, and threshold for cortical analysis = 690 mg/cm3. Cell and microsomal fractions containing SPT were prepared from CHO-K1 cells and LY-B cells (as a negative control of SPT activity) and mouse tissues, respectively (14.Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochim.

CHO-K1 cells were cultivated in spinner bottles containing 1 liter of ES medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, NaHCO3 (1 g/liter), 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), and 5% (v/v) FBS at 37 °C. The membrane fraction was prepared essentially as described previously (14.Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 754: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The presence of SPT was monitored by Western blotting using anti-SPT antibody (Cayman Chemical, MI). For mouse tissues, the mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the liver, kidney, and lung were removed, minced with scissors, and homogenized with a glass homogenizer under isotonic conditions with Hepes (pH 7.4), sucrose, and EDTA. The microsomal pellet was prepared by serial centrifugation and finally suspended in 1 ml/g of tissue with 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% (w/v) glycerol and stored at −80 °C (13.Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8409-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Either the cell or microsomal fraction containing SPT was incubated in 200 μl of a standard SPT reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm pyridoxal phosphate, 25 μm palmitoyl-CoA, and 0.1 mm l-Ser) at 37 °C for 10 min; for labeling of the product, either l-[3H]Ser (50 mCi/mmol: Amersham Biosciences, NJ) or [14C]palmitoyl-CoA (Amersham Biosciences) was used. After the reaction was stopped, the lipids were extracted, and the radioactively labeled KDS was measured as described (14.Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 754: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15.Williams R.D. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The mice were purchased from CLEA Japan Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) and bred and maintained in accordance with the guidelines of the Nara Institute of Science and Technology Animal Ethics Committee. We reported previously that l-Ser was indispensable for osteoclasts to form in vitro (6.Ogawa T. Ishida-Kitagawa N. Tanaka A. Matsumoto T. Hirouchi T. Akimaru M. Tanihara M. Yogo K. Takeya T. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2006; 24: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Namely, when l-Ser was depleted from the regular medium, the expression of c-Fos as well as NFAT2 was significantly down-regulated in both RAW264 cells and bone marrow macrophages. Conversely, the addition of l-Ser without another NEAA restored the expression of NFAT2, and the retroviral transfer of NFAT2 appeared to compensate for the depletion of l-Ser (6.Ogawa T. Ishida-Kitagawa N. Tanaka A. Matsumoto T. Hirouchi T. Akimaru M. Tanihara M. Yogo K. Takeya T. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2006; 24: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Regarding this, d-Ser was found to be unable to substitute for l-Ser, and instead, when d-Ser was added together with l-Ser up to a 390-fold excess, there was a suppressive effect on NFAT2/c-Fos expression (Fig. 1A). In fact, when the effect of d-Ser was monitored by the formation of TRAP-positive MN cells, only a few corresponding cells were observed in the presence of 3 mm d-Ser, and even entire viable cells became limited with 10 mm d-Ser (Fig. 1B), suggesting the toxicity of d-Ser. This inhibitory effect of d-Ser was unique to osteoclastic cells in that it little influenced the proliferation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts even in the presence of 10 mm d-Ser (Fig. 1C). The above results implied that compounds with antagonistic activity against l-Ser might be useful for modulating osteoclastogenesis. However, because d-Ser showed toxicity to preosteoclastic cells (Fig. 1B), we conducted a systematic search focusing on serine analogs with effective suppressive activity but less toxicity. To this end, we tested ∼100 substances according to the procedure shown in Fig. 2A. The analogs could be classified into three groups based on their characteristics at the first screening step: namely, (i) those that could substitute for l-Ser and formed MN cells, (ii) those that caused cell death, and (iii) those that did not affect cell viability but little influenced the formation of TRAP-positive MN cells. We then examined the inhibitory activity of the third group in the presence of l-Ser. H-Ser(tBu)-OMe·HCl, given analog 290, showed the most desirable properties in terms of solubility in water and effects on differentiation and viability and was mainly used in subsequent experiments. Actually, as shown in Fig. 2B, the addition of analog 290 to the regular differentiation system significantly suppressed the formation of TRAP-positive MN cells but had little effect on the proliferation or viability of MEF and RAW264 cells at 10 mm, in contrast to d-Ser (Fig. 2C). RANKL is known to activate a signaling cascade leading to the induction of NFAT2 expression/activity, and MAPK and c-Fos play essential roles in this cascade (16.Tanaka S. Nakamura K. Takahasi N. Suda T. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 208: 30-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Actually, l-Ser-depleted conditions caused the down-regulation of this cascade (Ref. 6.Ogawa T. Ishida-Kitagawa N. Tanaka A. Matsumoto T. Hirouchi T. Akimaru M. Tanihara M. Yogo K. Takeya T. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2006; 24: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar and Fig. 1A). When 3 mm of analog 290 was included in the regular reaction mixture, the activation of ERK and p38 as well as the expression of c-Fos and NFAT2 were found to be significantly down-regulated (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that the analog functions by suppressing the RANKL/RANK signaling cascade under conditions similar to those caused by the depletion of l-Ser. Regarding this, the expression of RANK was found to be down-regulated in the analog-treated cells (Fig. 3C), and moreover, its localization in membrane lipid rafts appeared to be significantly reduced (Fig. 3D). Overall, it is conceivable that this down-regulation causes the suppression of the downstream signaling machinery. To understand the functional mechanism of the analog, we examined the effect of its dosage on the metabolism of l-Ser. l-Ser is known to be metabolized to ceramide/sphingolipids in mammalian cells through the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA by SPT as a first step, producing KDS. In this regard, an important role for glycosphingolipid in osteoclastogenesis was reported (17.Iwamoto T. Fukumoto S. Kanaoka K. Sakai E. Shibata M. Fukumoto E. Inokuchi J. Takamiya K. Furukawa K. Kato Y. Mizuno A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46031-46038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The involvement of this pathway in the formation of MN cells was actually confirmed in our system using myriocin, an SPT inhibitor. When 1.0 μm of myriocin was added to the RAW264 cells, the expression of c-Fos and NFAT2 as well as RANK was found to be significantly down-regulated (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that the metabolism of l-Ser through SPT plays an essential role in the activation of the RANKL/RANK signaling cascade. Because l-Ser was present in the medium, the results obtained with the use of myriocin also suggested that l-Ser per se does not act directly. Moreover, FB1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase acting at the salvage pathway of ceramide synthesis as well as at the second last step of the de novo synthesis pathway, had a similar effect to myriocin on c-Fos, NFAT2, and RANK. These results, combined with those in Fig. 3, strongly suggested that metabolites, in particular ceramide and/or its derivatives, play a role in the activation of the RANKL/RANK signaling cascade through the modulation of RANK expression. To test the involvement of SPT as a target of analog 290 more directly, we purified SPT and examined the effect of the analog on the formation of KDS. As shown in Fig. 5A, we measured the production of KDS using [14C]palmitoyl-CoA as a substrate. When 1 mm l-Ser was included in the reaction mixture containing the microsomal fraction of mouse liver, the production of KDS was clearly observed, in contrast to the fraction from LY-B cells, which are known to lack SPT activity (18.Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Neither d-Ser nor the analog produced KDS, and when a 5-fold excess of either was added together with l-Ser, the production of KDS was reduced to 20 and 75% of the control level, respectively (Fig. 5B); a 5-fold excess of neither d-Ser nor analog 290 was a saturated concentration (data not shown). Regarding this, d-Ser was reported to inhibit KDS production in a competitive manner (19.Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 63-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Together, the analog seems to function at SPT reducing l-Ser metabolism, affecting osteoclastogenesis. In fact, when LacCer, a glycosphingolipid, was added exogenously to the analog-treated cells, the formation of TRAP-positive MN cells recovered (Fig. 4, C and D). Given the potential of the analog as an inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis in vitro, we wanted to examine its effect in vivo, aiming to answer two questions; does the analog actually suppress osteoclastogenesis in vivo, and does it regulate bone turnover? To this end, we first prepared mice whose bone turnover was enhanced by introducing recombinant RANKL via an intraperitoneal injection. This procedure was previously reported as useful for studying the consequences of high bone turnover for bone quality and strength in animals (10.Lloyd S.A. Yuan Y.Y. Kostenuik P.J. Ominsky M.S.

Udagawa N. Yasuda H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2009; 24: 1194-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The administration of 100 μg of RANKL/day for 3 days in C57BL/6 mice was found to induce a loss of bone density in trabecular bone of tibiae as shown in Fig. 6 (A and B), when assessed using pQCT and micro-CT. The density in cortical bone, on the other hand, was unaffected under such conditions (Fig. 6A).FIGURE 6Effects of analog 290 on bone structure and histomorphometry. A, preparation of high bone turnover mice. The indicated amount of recombinant soluble RANKL was administered to C57BL/6 mice (n = 10) every day for 4 days.

The LD50 of the analog in C57BL6 mice was examined and determined as 2,845 mg/kg of body weight (data not shown). When 15 mm of the analog was administered to the control mice for 3 days, a significant increase in bone density was observed (Fig. 6C), suggesting an apparent effect on bone resorption. Bone architecture appeared normal as a whole, and yet no osteopetrotic status was observed in analog 290-treated mice (Fig. 6B). Subsequently, we tested its effect in RANKL-treated mice. When the analog was administered twice a day prior to the RANKL treatment and the following 3 days at three different concentrations, the loss of bone density in trabecular bone was significantly prevented (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, the administration of analog 290 for 3 months apparently had no significant effect on the condition of C57BL/6 mice such as body weight, whereas bone density remained high (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, histomorphometry was performed on cancellous bones of vehicle- and analog 290-treated mice, and indices are shown in Fig. 6E. Parameters concerning osteoclasts and resorbing activity such as osteoclast surface/bone surface, number of osteoclasts/bone surface, eroded surface/bone surface, and bone resorption rate appeared to be suppressed as expected. Slight reductions in mineralization of surface/bone surface and bone formation rate/bone surface may reflect the decreased coupling and/or bone turnover. As a result, a significant increase in total bone volume/tissue volume as well as in trabecular structure (trabecular thickness, trabecular number, and trabecular separation) was noted as a whole. Previous findings that l-Ser was required in the in vitro differentiation system and that the introduction of d-Ser suppressed the formation of osteoclasts suggested a novel method of regulating osteoclastogenesis and prompted us to search for serine analogs with more desirable properties. We consequently identified the analog 290, H-Ser(tBu)-OMe HCl, containing a l-Ser backbone and forming methyl ester but have been unable to identify the structural characteristics distinguishing analog 290 from the rest. Therefore, at this moment, we cannot make predictions based solely on structure. Analog 290 showed solubility in water and relatively strong inhibitory activity; it had not only an inhibitory effect on osteoclastogenesis in vitro but a significant and rapid suppressive effect on bone turnover in mice. Another characteristic feature of the analog was that it showed a competitive effect with l-Ser on SPT that catalyzes the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and l-Ser to produce KDS (20.Hanada K. Biochim. Bipphys. Acta. 2003; 1632: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). d-Ser was reported to inhibit KDS production in a competitive manner (19.Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 63-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Incubation of SPT with [palmitoyl-14C]palmitoyl-CoA and the analog did not produce [14C]KDS. An analysis of the production of KDS from l-Ser using partially purified SPT and [14C]palmitoyl-CoA revealed the analog to be ∼50% as effective as d-Ser, suggesting that the analog has weaker activity than d-Ser as an inhibitor of SPT. Combined with the results obtained using the SPT inhibitor myriocin, these findings strongly suggest that the analog exerts its effect by down-regulating the production by SPT of the initial metabolite in the metabolism of l-Ser, and this may be the cause of the inhibitory effect on osteoclastogenesis. Hanada et al. (13.Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8409-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) reported that all of the amino, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups of l-Ser are responsible for the substrate's regulation of SPT. Because only the amino group is conserved intact in the analog, the weaker activity could be due to a lack of both carboxyl and hydroxyl groups at appropriate positions. However, detailed analyses may be required for understanding the functional mechanism of analog 290. Furthermore, d-Ser at 3 mm had a toxic effect on differentiating RAW264 cells but little effect on fibroblastic cells, suggesting a high turnover of serine metabolism to be a prerequisite for osteoclastogenesis. We observed that the analog treatment caused the reduction of RANK expression and the relocalization of RANK from membrane lipid rafts. This may explain the down-regulation of MAPK activity and the expression level of c-Fos and NFAT2 in those cells. The expression of RANK was also significantly suppressed by 1.0 μm myriocin administration. Therefore, it seems that reduced levels of sphingolipid metabolites caused by the down-regulation of SPT activity by the analog resulted in the down-regulation of RANK expression and the modulation of its localization in membrane lipid rafts. Regarding this, glycosphingolipid was reported to play an important role in osteoclastogenesis (17.Iwamoto T. Fukumoto S. Kanaoka K. Sakai E. Shibata M. Fukumoto E. Inokuchi J. Takamiya K.

Cell Signal. 2008; 20: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). d-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, a gycosylceramide synthase inhibitor, was shown to completely inhibit the formation of osteoclasts among bone marrow cells, and the addition of LacCer rescued the formation of TRAP-positive mononucleated cells but not multinucleated cells (17.Iwamoto T. Fukumoto S. Kanaoka K. Sakai E. Shibata M. Fukumoto E. Inokuchi J. Takamiya K. Furukawa K. Kato Y. Mizuno A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46031-46038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here the addition of LacCer to the analog-treated RAW264 cells rescued the suppressed formation of TRAP-positive MN cells accompanying an up-regulation of NFAT2 expression. Therefore, the recovery obtained with LacCer observed in this study may reflect either the difference in cell-type used or the partial inhibition of SPT by analog 290. In any case, how LacCer regulates RANK expression is an intriguing question and awaits further analysis. The usefulness of the analog as a modulator of osteoclastogenesis was further tested in vivo. In fact, we observed the effect of the dosage of analog 290 in vivo using control and high bone turnover mice. Osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis are considered major diseases in the field of bone metabolism in terms of the number of patients affected as well as the severity of their effect on ordinary life. Various approaches and drugs have been used to treat these diseases. The l-Ser analog with the inhibitory activity of SPT thus identified may have unique potential as a therapeutic tool, given that it is completely different from currently available drugs in terms of its chemical as well as biological properties and has low production costs. Importantly, because l-Ser is considered a nonessential amino acid in mammals, and the methodology described below does not modify the l-Ser biosynthetic pathway at the genetic level, there should be little damage to homeostasis. Although treatment for 3 months did not cause any obvious change in mice, a more precise analysis may be needed if the analog is to be used for therapeutic purposes."

Rapid mix/chemical quench and stopped-flow spectrofluorometry measurements were carried out with Rho and [γ-32P]ATP, mantADP, or fluorescently tagged E. coli phosphate-binding protein. The results indicate that the Pi off-rate is not rate limiting, but at ∼90 s−1, the ADP dissociation rate is comparable to the 30 s−1 kcat. Previous results indicate that the chemistry step of ATP hydrolysis by Rho is at least 10-fold faster than the overall catalytic cycle. The as yet unmeasured RNA dissociation step, which could be associated with a protein conformation change, might also be a rate-limiting factor. To define the molecular mechanism by which ATP hydrolysis powers the 5′→3′ travel of homohexameric Escherichia coli transcription termination factor Rho along RNA, rates for association and dissociation of non-RNA substrates and products were measured.

Previous results indicate that the chemistry step of ATP hydrolysis by Rho is at least 10-fold faster than the overall catalytic cycle. The as yet unmeasured RNA dissociation step, which could be associated with a protein conformation change, might also be a rate-limiting factor. Escherichia coli transcription termination protein Rho is a homohexameric RNA/DNA helicase that uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to travel directionally 5′→3′ along nascent RNA and to disrupt the ternary transcription complex when it reaches transcribing RNA polymerase (for reviews, see Refs. 1.Richardson J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 2.Banerjee S. Chalissery J. Bandey I. Sen R. J. Microbiol. 2006; 44: 11-22PubMed Google Scholar). The release of RNA from the DNA template and from RNA polymerase is thought to result from Rho travel along RNA, a process fueled by RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis by Rho. This energy expenditure presumably leads to protein conformation changes that allow the repeated binding and release of RNA by Rho that constitute travel. The coordination of ATP hydrolysis with Rho/RNA interactions and the molecular details of these processes are not yet clear. To achieve transcript release, Rho binds an 80-base stretch of the relevant RNA (3.Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 4.Bear D.G. Hicks P.S. Escudero K.W. Andrews C.L. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This is accomplished by RNA binding on one face of Rho along its six circularly arranged subunits (5.Skordalakes E. Berger J.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and then passing through a central hole in the hexamer (6.Burgess B.R. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4182-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Neither the subsequent movements of RNA in response to ATP hydrolysis nor the manner of final RNA release from Rho are known. The directional movement of Rho with respect to RNA is likely to involve travel of the RNA through the central hole of the Rho hexamer. Rho is thus a specific example of a system in which a multisubunit protein moves an unfolded macromolecule (nucleic acid or protein); examples include not only ATP-dependent helicases such as Rho, but also ATP-dependent proteases (7.White S.R. Lauring B. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1657-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and virus packaging proteins (8.Mancini E.J. Kainov D.E. Grimes J.M. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Cell. 2004; 118: 743-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although there are proposed mechanochemical models for several of these systems, proof for any is incomplete. Protein structures underlie current mechanism proposals: connecting actions are predicted when different structures with bound substrates or products are available (e.g. 8.Mancini E.J. Kainov D.E. Grimes J.M. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Cell. 2004; 118: 743-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the order and kinetics of all steps of the catalytic cycle, however, is indispensable for mechanistic understanding. It has previously been established that Rho ATPase activity has a Vmax of 30 s−1 at 22 °C (9.Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Rho has a single class of three ATP binding sites that are catalytic sites (10.Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Stitt B.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2276-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with a KD of 1 μm and based on crystal structure (5.Skordalakes E. Berger J.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), three more sites that may fill with ATP only at millimolar levels. During steady-state Vmax ATP hydrolysis, three molecules of ATP are bound per hexamer (12.Browne R.J. Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To determine which one or more aspects of the protein's action limits the speed of catalysis, we measured ATP binding and the rates of ADP and Pi release from Rho. We found that, at physiological ATP concentration, the ATP on-rate and Pi hydrolysis product dissociation are not rate-limiting; they are faster than kcat. The ADP off-rate, however, is of the same magnitude as catalysis and could be a determinant of Vmax. Wild-type Rho from E. coli was prepared as previously described (13.Mott J.E. Grant R.A. Ho Y.S. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) from strain AR120/A6 containing plasmid p39ASE (14.Nehrke K.W. Seifried S.E. Platt T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6107Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The concentration of Rho was spectrophotometrically determined using ϵ280 nm1% = 3.25 cm−1 (15.Geiselmann J. Yager T.D. Gill S.C. Calmettes P. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The preparations used had specific activities with poly(C) at 37 °C of 10–20 units mg−1. A unit of activity is the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 μmol of ATP in 1 min. 2′,3′-O-(N′-Methylanthraniloyl-ATP) (mantATP) 2The abbreviations used are: mantATP2′,3′-O-(N′-methylanthraniloyl)-ATPMDCCN-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamidePBPphosphate-binding protein. and mantADP were from Jena Bioscience, Germany. In our standard Vmax Rho ATPase assay in the absence of ATP, mantATP was transformed into a faster-migrating compound on TLC (see below) plus Pi, consistent with it serving similarly to ATP as substrate for the hydrolysis activity of Rho. It has previously been used as a Rho substrate (16.Jeong Y.J. Kim D.E. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18370-18376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]mantATP were synthesized by an exchange reaction and subsequently purified (Ref. 17.Glynn I.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, as modified previously (18.Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3718-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Specific activities ranged from ∼103 to 106 cpm/nmol. The mantATP exchange reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 6 h, followed by purification through a Sephadex LH20 column (Amersham Biosciences) in water (similar to purification of 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ATP in Ref. 18.Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3718-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final fractions were analyzed by TLC (Polygram CEL 300 PEI/UV254, Machery-Nagel, Germany; in 2 m formic acid/0.5 m LiCl and quantified using a Packard Cyclone phosphorimaging device (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)). The final combined fractions were found to have <3% of radioactivity in Pi. 2′,3′-O-(N′-methylanthraniloyl)-ATP N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide phosphate-binding protein. RNA was poly(C) from Amersham Biosciences, dissolved in water and used without further purification. Its average size was 400 bases as stated by the manufacturer. It was typically used in 2- to 30-fold excess of 100-base long equivalents over Rho hexamers. The buffer used was TAGME (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8 at 37 °C, 150 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA). Rho ATPase activity was measured using [γ-32P]ATP and monitoring the production of 32Pi (10.Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction samples were typically quenched by addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 2.5% (w/w). 32Pi product was separated from [γ-32P]ATP by mixing with acid-washed charcoal in water at a final concentration of 2.5% (w/v) and sampling the supernatant after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min. A rapid mix/chemical quench apparatus (model 1500/1501/1502, Update Instrument, Madison, WI) (19.Johnson K.A. The Enzymes.in: Boyer P.D. 4th Ed. Academic Press, New York1992: 1-61Google Scholar, 20.Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) with either a Wiskind or T mixer was used at room temperature (21–23 °C, Scheme 1). Rho was mixed with [γ-32P]ATP, and, after various times, excess unlabeled ATP and RNA were added to promote hydrolysis of bound [γ-32P]ATP. Trichloroacetic acid and charcoal were then used as in the other experiments to measure 32P production. Equal volumes of Rho (1.9 mg/ml and 20 μm active sites) in one syringe of the rapid mix instrument and [γ-32P]ATP (20 μm or 40 μm, 1 × 106 cpm/nmol) in the other syringe were mixed and passed through an aging hose into 240 μl of rapidly stirred trap solution, which was 18 mm unlabeled ATP, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 0.15 mg/ml poly(C) in TAGME buffer. 2 s later, 160 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid was added to quench the reaction. From each 500-μl quenched mixture, 50 μl was counted for total radioactivity, and 50 μl was treated with 400 μl of 8% w/w charcoal to determine the amount of 32Pi produced. In control experiments to measure background, [γ-32P]ATP (20 μm or 40 μm) in TAGME buffer was injected into trap solution. Data were analyzed according to Equation 1 (21.Jencks W.P. Catalysis in Chemistry & Enzymology.

Rho·[γ-32P]ATP3 complexes were manually mixed with excess unlabeled ATP (chase), then poly(C) (trap) was added to promote ATP hydrolysis (Scheme 2). A mixture of Rho (10 μm active sites) and [γ-32P]ATP (30 μm at 5 × 104 cpm/nmol) was prepared in TAGME buffer. 100-μl portions were injected (10.Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into 230 μl of rapidly stirred chase solution (20 mm unlabeled ATP, 20 mm magnesium acetate in TAGME buffer). After chase times of 2 s, 5 s, or 2 min (during which [γ-32P]ATP could dissociate), 12 μl of 5 mg/ml poly(C) (trap) was added. Following poly(C) addition, 160 μl of 50% (w/w) trichloroacetic acid quench was added. Three separate experiments for each chase time were carried out, in which trichloroacetic acid was added between 5 and 30 s of trap time. Following quench, the ATP hydrolyzed at the three trap times was plotted and linearly extrapolated to zero trap time. For each 500-μl quenched reaction mixture, total radioactivity was determined in a 50-μl sample, and another 50 μl was treated with 400 μl of 8% w/w charcoal to determine the amount of 32Pi produced. As a measure of background and of the efficacy of the quench, the mixture of Rho plus [γ-32P]ATP was injected into trap solution plus trichloroacetic acid, followed by addition of poly(C) 2 s later. The off-rate of ATP (k) was calculated from Equation 2, At=A0e-kt(Eq. 2) where A0 and At are moles of bound ATP/mol of hexamer at zero trap time for chase times 0 and t. The amount of [γ-32P]ATP initially bound to Rho was measured by sampling the total binding mixture and the free [γ-32P]ATP after ultrafiltration of the mixture through Microcon filters with 30-kDa molecular mass cutoff (11.Stitt B.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2276-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In a stopped-flow spectrofluorometer (Model SF-2003, KinTek Corp., Austin, TX), a mixture of Rho (0.5 μm in hexamer) plus mantADP (1.5 μm) plus poly(C) (0.05 mg/ml) in TAGME buffer, in one syringe of the apparatus, was mixed at room temperature with an equal volume of 1 mm ATP or 1 mm ADP in the same buffer plus 1 mm magnesium acetate, in the other syringe (Scheme 3). The fluorescence emission at 450 nm was monitored using a 400 nm cutoff long pass filter (Model 57345, Spectra-Physics Oriel Corp., Stratford, CT) with excitation at 360 nm. The experiments were also done with poly(C) placed in the syringe with ATP or ADP instead of Rho and mantADP. Release of mantADP from Rho in the absence of RNA was also studied. In control experiments to measure fluorescence background, Rho was in one syringe, poly(C) and ATP in the other syringe, and no mantADP was used. The mantADP dissociation kinetic data were fit to a single exponential function (Equation 3) or to the sum of two exponential functions (Equation 4), Ft=A1e-k1t+C(Eq. 3) Ft=A1e-k1t+A2e-k2t+C(Eq. 4) where Ft is the fluorescence intensity at time t, A1 and A2 are the fluorescence amplitudes, C is the fluorescence intensity when t = ∞, and k1 and k2 are the observed rates. [γ-32P]mantATP hydrolysis by Rho was measured as in the Vmax assay for poly(C)-dependent ATP hydrolysis by Rho (10.Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by quantitation of the 32Pi produced at room temperature in the presence of poly(C) as the required RNA cofactor. Each 50-μl assay mixture in TAGME was 1.1 mm [γ-32P]mantATP (∼6000 cpm/nmol), 1 mm magnesium acetate, 2 μg/ml in poly(C), and contained 25 ng of Rho. All ingredients except Rho were mixed and preincubated at room temperature for 5 min. After 15 min of incubation with Rho, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 250 μl of ice-cold 5% (w/w) trichloroacetic acid and 150 μl of 8% charcoal. Following centrifugation, a sample of the supernatant containing 32Pi was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The Vmax assay with [γ-32P]ATP was performed as a control. Background 32Pi was obtained by replacing protein solution with TAGME buffer in the assay. mantATP equilibrium binding measurements were conducted at room temperature using Microcon-30 ultrafiltration apparati (Millipore) (see Ref. 11.Stitt B.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2276-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Each 100-μl binding mixture was 1 μm Rho (in subunits) and 0.25–12 μm [γ-32P]mantATP with specific activity of 1.8 × 105 cpm/nmol. After the binding mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 min, ∼70 μl was applied on the Microcon membrane, which was then centrifuged to separate bound from free [γ-32P]mantATP. The data were analyzed by Scatchard analysis (bound/free was plotted versus bound/Rho subunit). The Pi off-rate (a–d) was measured using a fluorescently tagged form of the A197C mutant of E. coli phosphate-binding protein (PBP) and protocols similar to those previously published (23.Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 24.Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 25.Sukal S. Leyh T.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15009-15016Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We obtained the strain ANCC75 with the plasmid pSN5182 encoding the mutant PBP from Martin Webb, MRC, Mill Hill, UK; this strain was induced to overproduce PBP by phosphate limitation as described (24.Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and was labeled with the coumarin N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide (MDCC), available from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Invitrogen) as described before (25.Sukal S. Leyh T.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15009-15016Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) as follows. (a) Expression and purification of PBP: ANCC75 was grown as described (24.Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar); in high phosphate TG plus medium, the culture required ∼12 h at 37 °C to achieve an A600 of 1.5. Following PBP induction in low phosphate medium, PBP was released from cells by osmotic shock (24.Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and purified as described (26.Nossal N.G. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3055-3062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final PBP solution was stored as 50- to 100-μl aliquots at −70 °C. PBP concentrations were determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 17.8 (mg/ml)cm−1 (24.Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). ∼40 mg of PBP was purified from 13 g of wet cell pellet. (b) Synthesis and purification of MDCC-PBP: PBP was labeled with MDCC, and MDCC-PBP was purified from the labeling reaction mixture (25.Sukal S. Leyh T.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15009-15016Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The final product was stored as 50- to 100-μl aliquots at −70 °C. ∼32 mg of pure MDCC-PBP (based on a single band on SDS-PAGE gel) was obtained from 35 mg of PBP. (c) Pi“mop” to reduce Pi contamination: To measure Pi release from Rho using MDCC-PBP, adventitious Pi must be meticulously removed from the reagents and also the surfaces of instruments. Because poly(C) is involved in the reaction, all precautions to minimize RNase activity are also taken (diethyl pyrocarbonate treatment to inactivate ribonucleases). Pi mop composed of 7-methylguanosine (1 mm) and PNP (1 unit/ml) was used to remove Pi (23.Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 25.Sukal S. Leyh T.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15009-15016Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) by conversion to ribose 1-phosphate, which binds poorly to PBP. Concentrated MDCC-PBP and Rho in separate dialysis sacs (Spectra/Por) were dialyzed against 40 volumes of TAGME containing Pi mop at 4 °C for 24 h. Pi was removed from the larger volumes of TAGME buffer and from concentrated ATP solutions by placing Pi mop (∼1/5 volume) inside a dialysis bag. The treated enzymes and reagents were assayed for Pi using a PiPer phosphate assay kit, sensitive down to 0.2 μm Pi (Molecular Probes), following the manufacturer's protocol. The fluorescence produced was detected by a Wallac 1420 VICTOR3 fluorescence microtiter plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation at 530 nm (using 530 nm excitation filter for VICTORTM, catalogue no. 1420-502) and emission at 590 nm (with 590 nm emission filter for VICTORTM, catalogue no. 1420-544). The stopped-flow syringes and sample lines were treated with Pi mop for 30 min, and then rinsed with ∼10 ml Pi mop-treated TAGME buffer. (d) Stopped-flow kinetics of Pi dissociation from Rho (Scheme 4): Phosphate release kinetics were measured in the KinTek stopped-flow spectrofluorometer using a fluorescence-coupled assay (23.Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 25.Sukal S. Leyh T.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15009-15016Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Rho was rapidly mixed with ATP and RNA in the presence of MDCC-PBP. Following hydrolysis of the ATP by Rho, when Pi is released from the active site, MDCC-PBP traps the free Pi and exhibits a fluorescence increase. A standard curve for Pi-MDCC-PBP fluorescence was determined by stopped-flow experiments in which 20 μl of a premix of 9 μm MDCC-PBP (concentration in the syringe) plus 0.04 unit/ml PNP and 0.2 mm 7-methylguanosine in TAGME buffer was mixed with 20 μl of various concentrations of Pi solution (0.5–11 μm) in TAGME buffer at room temperature. The excitation wavelength was 425 nm, and the fluorescence emission at 464 nm was detected using a 450 nm cutoff long pass filter (Model 57347, Spectra-Physics Oriel Corp.). To find the off-rate of Pi from Rho, in one syringe of the stopped-flow instrument was 1.5 μm Rho hexamer, 9 μm MDCC-PBP, 0.02 unit/ml PNP, and 0.1 mm 7-methylguanosine in TAGME buffer; the other syringe held 200 μm ATP, 0.15 mg/ml poly(C), 0.02 unit/ml PNP, and 0.1 mm 7-methylguanosine in TAGME buffer. The measurements were also made with poly(C) placed in the syringe with Rho and MDCC-PBP instead of in the syringe with ATP. 5–7 scans were averaged to obtain the final traces. The beginning part of the trace (0–0.03 s) was fit to a single exponential function to determine the rate of Pi release. The control reactions to determine adventitious background included 1) Rho and MDCC-PBP in one syringe and poly(C) in the other syringe and 2) Rho and MDCC-PBP in one syringe and ADP and poly(C) in the other syringe. Data for Pi binding to MDCC-PBP were compared with the curves produced using a model in which Pi binding was preceded by a step in which Pi was released from Rho. Various Pi release rates were tried. Four 150-μl mixtures in TAGME were as follows: 1) 10 μm Rho subunits plus 30 mm 32Pi; 2) 30 mm 32Pi; 3) 10 μm Rho subunits plus 30 mm 32Pi plus 1 mm ADP plus 0.2 mg/ml poly(C); and 4) 30 mm 32Pi plus 1 mm ADP plus 0.2 mg/ml poly(C). The specific activity of 32Pi was 1 × 104 cpm/nmol. For each binding mixture, a 10-μl portion was used to measure total radioactivity; the remaining solution was applied to 1-ml disposable syringes that had been filled with Sephadex G-50 and centrifuged at 100 × g for 2 min (28.Penefsky H.S. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The syringe was then centrifuged identically a second time to separate unbound small molecules (which remain in the column) from those bound to Rho (which elutes from the column). The radioactivity in the filtrate was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. Rapid mix/chemical quench experiments were carried out as diagrammed in Scheme 1. Rapid mixing of 10 or 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP with 3.3 μm Rho hexamer was followed by aging for 50–200 ms. The mixture was then injected into a stirred trap solution containing RNA plus 10 mm nonradioactive MgATP. Under these conditions, any [γ-32P]ATP bound to Rho is hydrolyzed, whereas non-bound radioactive ATP is diluted >1000-fold by trap ATP. After 2 s, trichloroacetic acid is added to quench the reaction, and product 32Pi is determined as a measure of the amount of radioactive ATP that bound to Rho during the aging step. To obtain the on-rate constant, the data for each concentration of [γ-32P]ATP were analyzed for a second-order reaction according to Jencks (21.Jencks W.P. Catalysis in Chemistry & Enzymology. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1969: 564-565Google Scholar). Data are shown in Fig. 1; the rates are from the slopes of least-squares-fit lines. The results from the two concentrations of ATP agree and indicate that the on-rate constant is 2.3–2.4 × 105 m−1 s−1. Using the above on-rate constant and the previously measured KD for ATP under similar conditions, 1 μm (9.Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), an ATP koff of 0.24 s−1 is calculated from KD = koff/kon, which corresponds to a half-life of 2.9 s. The following experiment was performed to check the magnitude of the off-rate. In manual rapid mix/chemical quench experiments (Scheme 2), Rho·[γ-32P]ATP3 complexes were mixed with non-radioactive ATP and chased for 2 or 5 s or 2 min, RNA was added to permit hydrolysis of Rho-bound ATP (trap), and the reaction was finally quenched with trichloroacetic acid. We note that the value obtained from this experimental design could be a composite of the ATP dissociation rates from both Rho·ATP and Rho·ATP·RNA complexes. Correction for rebinding of [γ-32P]ATP and its hydrolysis during the trap was made by quenching with trichloroacetic acid at 5, 10, and 20 s after RNA addition and extrapolating the linear data back to t = 0 (data not shown). No remaining bound [γ-32P]ATP was found when this extrapolation was made with data from 5-s and 2-min chase times (data not shown). The 2-s chase time was the fastest we could reliably achieve in a manual experiment, yielding a lower limit for the ATP off-rate of 0.8 ± 0.05 s−1 (t½ = 0.8 s), in fair agreement with the 0.24-s−1 and 2.9-s values calculated above. ADP analogue mantADP was employed in stopped-flow fluorescence experiments (Scheme 3) to measure ADP release from the Rho·ADP intermediate (or from the Rho·RNA·ADP intermediate when RNA was present). mantADP fluorescence is quenched by the buffer; therefore, when Rho plus mantADP was mixed with a large excess of ATP in a stopped-flow machine, the decrease of fluorescence indicates mantADP release from Rho active sites (29.Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16.Jeong Y.J. Kim D.E. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18370-18376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Variations on this experiment involved inclusion of RNA in the mantADP-Rho mixture, use of ADP instead of ATP in the second solution, and experiments in the absence of RNA (non-hydrolysis conditions). The results are presented in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The fluorescence traces fit well to a single exponential function (Equation 3) and to the sum of two exponentials (Equation 4). In the absence of RNA, information from fluorescence amplitudes (A1 and A2 in Table 1) indicates that k2 contributes the major part to the overall rate, and a single exponential fit is indicated. For experiments that included poly(C), A1 was close to A2, indicating a significant contribution from two events. Although it would be expected that a function with a single exponential would best fit the data, a fit by the sum of two exponentials is not ruled out because mantADP is a 70:30 mixture of two isomers, 3′-mantADP and 2′-mantADP (30.Jameson D.M. Eccleston J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 363-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which could interact differently with Rho (16.Jeong Y.J. Kim D.E. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18370-18376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The currently available structures for Rho do not clarify this possibility: nucleotides bind at Rho subunit interfaces (5.Skordalakes E. Berger J.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) in a very open protein configuration; modeling using Swiss-Pdb Viewer shows that there is sufficient space for either 2′- or 3′-mantADP (not shown). What happens when the protein closes around its substrate to perform hydrolysis is not known. A possible alternative explanation, that there is more than one type of mantATP binding site on Rho, was ruled out by [γ-32P]mantATP binding experiments, whose results were similar to those obtained with ATP: 3 equivalent mantATP binding sites on Rho with KD ∼ 1.5 μm (data not shown).TABLE 1mantADP release rate from RhoExperimentSingle exponential fitDouble exponential fitkk1A1k2A2s−1s−1s−1(Rho+mantADP)+(polyC+ATP)20.842.70.612.20.4(Rho+mantADP+polyC)+(ATP)17.171.70.68.20.4(Rho+mantADP)+(polyC+ADP)14.730.90.410.30.6(Rho+mantADP+polyC)+(ADP)19.534.10.84.90.2(Rho+mantADP)+(ATP)1.318.90.11.30.9(Rho+mantADP)+(ADP)1.215.80.11.20.9 Open table in a new tab We measured the Vmax of mantATP hydrolysis by Rho at 21 °C as 4.3 s−1, compared with 30 s−1 for ATP (data not shown). Presumably this decrease is because the additional ring structure on the ribose of mantATP affects its interaction with Rho, perhaps slowing its off-rate. The measurements of mantADP release from Rho in the presence of poly(C), 15–20 s−1 (Table 1, fitting a single exponential function), are all at least 3-fold faster than this steady-state mantATP hydrolysis rate. This is not a large factor, so mantADP release may make a significant contribution to rate limitation, although it is not necessarily the sole rate-limiting step in the mantATP hydrolysis pathway. In previous work using RhoE155K, we found the KD for Pi"
