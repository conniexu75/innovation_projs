https://openalex.org/W1970132032,"Multiple related cis-active elements required for cell-specific activation of the rat prolactin gene appear to bind a pituitary-specific positive transcription factor(s), referred to as Pit-1. DNA complementary to Pit-1 mRNA, cloned on the basis of specific binding to AT-rich cell-specific elements in the rat prolactin and growth hormone genes, encodes a 33 kd protein with significant similarity at its carboxyl terminus to the homeodomains encoded by Drosophila developmental genes. Pit-1 mRNA is expressed exclusively in the anterior pituitary gland in both somatotroph and lactotroph cell types, which produce growth hormone and prolactin, respectively. Pit-1 expression in heterologous cells (HeLa) selectively activates prolactin and growth hormone fusion gene expression, suggesting that Pit-1 is sufficient to confer a characteristic pituitary phenotype. The structure of Pit-1 and its recognition elements suggests that metazoan tissue phenotype is controlled by a family of transcription factors that bind to related cis-active elements and contain several highly conserved domains."

https://openalex.org/W2062617470,"Growth hormone factor 1 (GHF-1) is a pituitary-specific transcription factor that plays a critical role in cell type-specific expression of the growth hormone (GH) gene. Here, we describe the isolation of bovine and rat GHF-1 cDNA clones. These cDNAs encode proteins whose molecular mass, 33K, is identical to purified GHF-1 and whose sequence agrees with a partial GHF-1 peptide sequence. The predicted GHF-1 sequence contains a region, near its C-terminus, that exhibits considerable similarity to a homeobox consensus sequence. DNAase I footprinting with bacterially expressed fusion protein containing a fragment of GHF-1 encompassing the homeobox indicates that this region of the protein functions as its DNA binding domain. Expression of GHF-1 is restricted to cells of the somatotropic lineage in the pituitary. This remarkable specificity of GHF-1 expression correlates with the selective transcription of its target, the GH gene. Other mammalian homeobox-containing proteins may function similarly as transcription factors controlling cell type-specific expression in other locations."

https://openalex.org/W1498982174,"Abstract Previous studies have shown that differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes leads to the activation of transcription of an unidentified gene which encodes a 4.9-kilobase (kb) mRNA. Several cDNAs that include the complete sequence of this mRNA were obtained and used to isolate and characterize the gene. Analysis of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of both cDNA and genomic clones revealed that the gene encodes the mouse stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), an enzyme known to be expressed upon differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The predicted amino acid sequence (355 residues) of the mouse 3T3-L1 adipocyte SCD exhibits 92% identity to that of the rat liver SCD. There is also a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity between the mouse and rat mRNAs in their unusually long approximately 3.5-kb 3'-untranslated regions. Mice fed a diet containing unsaturated triacylglycerides express SCD mRNA only in adipose tissue, whereas mice starved and refed a fat-free diet, express SCD mRNA in both liver and adipose tissue. The mouse gene for the desaturase spans approximately 15 kb and contains 6 exons and 5 introns with all intron-exon junctions conforming to the GT/AG splicing rule. As determined by S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension analysis, the transcriptional initiation site maps 152 nucleotides upstream from the initiation methionine codon. A canonical promoter TATA box is located 30 base pairs upstream of the Cap site. A typical CCAAT box sequence is not present in the adjacent 5'-flanking region; however, there is a GC-rich sequence (at nucleotide -215) similar to the binding site for the nuclear transcription factor Sp1. Upstream from the transcriptional initiation site are elements with homology (approximately 75%) to the putative fat-specific transcriptional element FSE2 and core consensus sequences for cAMP and glucocorticoid regulatory elements. A chimeric construct, containing 363 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequence and 30 nucleotides of 5'-untranslated sequence of the mouse SCD gene ligated to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, was transfected into 3T3-L1 cells. When cells were induced to differentiate into adipocytes, expression of the SCD chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene increased approximately 63-fold, suggesting that the SCD promoter region contains elements that mediate the response to adipogenic agents which induce differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2054760667,"We have found that mitotic recombination within the S. cerevisiae rDNA cluster (200 tandemly repeated 9.1 kb units) is strongly suppressed and that this suppression requires the combined action of DNA topoisomerases I and II. Strains with a null mutation in the TOP1 gene (encoding topoisomerase I) or a ts mutation in the TOP2 gene (encoding topoisomerase II) grown at a semipermissive temperature show 50- to 200-fold higher frequencies of mitotic recombination in rDNA relative to TOP+ controls. Suppression of recombination is specific to the rDNA because the recombination frequency at another tandem array, the CUP1 locus, at a simple HIS4 duplication, or among dispersed repeats (MAT and HML or HMR) is not elevated in top1 or top2 mutants. The high frequency of mitotic recombination within the rDNA cluster in topoisomerase mutants shows that both TOP1 and TOP2 are required for suppression of recombination in this region of the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1578080358,"The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor type III is a low abundance cell surface component that binds TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 with high affinity and specificity, and is present in many mammalian and avian cell types. Type III TGF-beta receptors affinity-labeled with 125I-TGF-beta migrate in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels as diffuse species of 250-350 kDa. Here we show that type III receptors deglycosylated by the action of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid yield affinity-labeled receptor cores of 110-130 kDa. This marked decrease in molecular weight is also achieved by combined treatment of type III receptors with heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC. Digestion of receptor-linked glycosaminoglycans by treatment of intact cell monolayers with heparitinase and chondroitinase does not prevent TGF-beta binding to the type III receptor core polypeptide and does not release the receptor polypeptide from the membrane. The type III TGF-beta receptor binds tightly to DEAE-Sephacel and coelutes with cellular proteoglycans at a characteristically high salt concentration. Thus, the type III TGF-beta receptor has the properties of a membrane proteoglycan that carries heparan and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains. The binding site for TGF-beta appears to reside in the 100-120-kDa core polypeptide of this receptor. The type III receptor is highly sensitive to cleavage by trypsin. Trypsin action releases the glycosaminoglycan-containing domain of the receptor leaving a 60-kDa membrane-associated domain that contains the cross-linked ligand. A model for the domain structure of the TGF-beta receptor type III is proposed based on these results."

https://openalex.org/W1974426489,"The Deformed (Dfd) gene is a homeotic selector that functions in specifying the identity of the mandibular and maxillary segments. We have constructed transformed fly strains carrying a Dfd cDNA under the heat-inducible control of the hsp70 promoter. With these strains we can induce the ectopic expression of Dfd protein in other segments at various stages of embryonic development. We find that both early and persistent synthesis of the protein is required for the transformation of other body segments toward head segmental identity. The persistent expression of the Dfd protein requires an endogenous copy of the Dfd gene, and we show that the expression of the endogenous copy can be induced by hsDfd expression. This implies that the Dfd protein autoactivates expression from the Dfd locus during normal development. The autoactivation circuit supplies a simple mechanism that can account, in part, for the stability of the determined state controlled by Dfd."

https://openalex.org/W2057569302,"The rough mutation in Drosophila disrupts an early stage of ommatidial assembly in the developing eye imaginal disc. Analysis of somatic mosaics suggests that rough gene function is required only in photoreceptors R2 and R5. However, these cells apparently differentiate normally in mutant eye discs and it is the cells that are subsequently added to the ommatidium that behave aberrantly. The rough gene was isolated by P-element transposon tagging, and the mutant can be rescued by transformation with an 8.6 kb genomic fragment. The rough transcription unit is 4.3 kb and consists of three exons that are joined in a 1.3 kb mRNA. The predicted rough protein is 350 amino acids long and contains a homeobox. Taken together, our results suggest that the role of the rough gene product may be to regulate the sending of signals by photoreceptors R2 and R5 to their neighbors in the developing ommatidia."
https://openalex.org/W1581029120,"Through substitution mutagenesis and gene transfer experiments in cultured cells, we have identified three sequences in the 5' flanking region of the gene for hamster 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase that are required for sterol-mediated regulation of transcription. Point mutations in any one of these sequences largely prevented the increase in transcription that normally follows cellular sterol depletion. These mutations did not alter the low level of transcription that occurs in the presence of sterols. Two of the three sterol regulatory sequences contain an octanucleotide that shows a 7/8-base pair match with a sequence that was previously identified as a sterol regulatory element in the genes for HMG-CoA reductase and the low density lipoprotein receptor, both of which are induced by sterol deprivation. The third sterol regulatory region in the HMG-CoA synthase promoter shows only a low-level match with the other sterol regulatory elements. The current data suggest that the sterol regulatory elements in the HMG-CoA synthase promoter operate by a conditional positive mechanism: in the absence of sterols, regulatory proteins bind to these elements and stimulate transcription; in the presence of sterols, the regulatory proteins are inactivated and transcription decreases to the basal rate."
https://openalex.org/W1532698739,"Abstract Functional and structural similarities among a wide variety of endomembrane H+-ATPases suggest that they form a distinct class with a common origin. Immunological studies (Manolson, M. F., Percy, J. M., Apps, D. K., Xie, X. S., Stone, D. K., and Poole, R. J. (1987) in Proceedings of the Membrane Protein Symposium (Goheen, S. C., ed) pp. 427-434, Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, and M. F. Manolson, J. M. Percy, D. K. Apps, X. S. Xie, D. K. Stone, M. Harrison, D. J. Clarke, R. J. Poole, unpublished data) support this idea and suggest an evolutionary relationship between the endomembrane and F0F1 ATPases. Further examination of relationships necessitates comparison of protein/nucleic acid sequence data. To this end, we have cloned and sequenced the cDNA encoding the polypeptide of the Arabidopsis vacuolar membrane H+-ATPase. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the sequence of a 57-kDa subunit for plant or animal endomembrane H+-ATPase. This cDNA encodes a hydrophilic polypeptide containing a putative ATP binding site. Lack of a secretion signal sequence suggests it is not processed through the endoplasmic reticulum but translated on cytosolic ribosomes. Comparison of protein sequences shows the subunit from Arabidopsis to be nearly identical with the corresponding subunit in Neurospora vacuolar membrane H+-ATPase, very similar to the beta subunit of the archaebacterium Sulfolobus, and slightly, but nevertheless significantly, homologous to the alpha and beta subunits of the F0F1-ATPases. These results suggest that these different classes of ATPases have evolved from a common ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W1749033312,"The gene encoding the hypothalamic peptide thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) was isolated from two rat genomic bacteriophage libraries. Southern blot analysis indicates that the gene is present as a single copy in the rat genome. The transcriptional unit is 2.6 kilobases in size and contains three exons interrupted by two introns of approximately 750 and 450 base pairs. Exon 1 encodes the 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA, exon 2 encodes the signal sequence and the majority of the amino-terminal peptide, and exon 3 encodes the remainder of the amino-terminal peptide, five copies of the TRH sequence, the carboxyl-terminal peptide, and the 3'-untranslated region of the mRNA. The general structure of the TRH gene resembles that of three other polypeptide hormone genes, preproopiomelanocortin, preproenkephalin A, and preproenkephalin B. Further sequence analysis revealed that characteristic promoter elements are present in the 5'-flanking region of the TRH gene. In addition, sequence homologies with the glucocorticoid receptor binding site, the GC box hexanucleotide, and a portion of the flanking region of the thyroid stimulating hormone beta-subunit gene were also identified. These upstream sequences may be important for the regulation of TRH gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1884185957,"A second transport ATPase gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been identified by hybridization to a PMA1 probe and sequenced. The gene called PMA2 encodes a polypeptide of Mr = 102,157, which, with the exception of the 144 amino-terminal residues, is highly homologous to the structural gene PMA1 for the H+-ATPase. It is localized on the chromosome XVI at 16.7 centimorgan from gal4 and is not essential for haploid growth. Comparison between the upstream, noncoding DNA regions of PMA1 and PMA2 indicates that the two genes are controlled differently. The extensive amino acid sequence homology with the fungal H+-ATPases described so far indicates that the PMA2-encoded protein is also able to function as a H+ pump. This is supported by the observation that in pma1 mutants with reduced plasma membrane ATPase activity, disruption of the PMA2 gene confers the ability to grow under alkaline pH conditions. Slower development of diploids is also observed on normal minimal medium after bilateral disruption of PMA2 in the two parents."
https://openalex.org/W1547084038,"Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (tyrosine hydroxylase) is a non-heme iron, tetrahydropterin-dependent enzyme which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of catecholamines. The highly purified bovine adrenal enzyme contains an unusual blue-green chromophore with lambda max at around 700 nm (epsilon = 1.3 (mM subunit enzyme)-1 cm-1). On excitation at 605.2 nm, resonance-enhanced Raman vibrations are observed at 454, 494, 527, 604, 635, 835, 1130, 1271, 1320, 1426, and 1476 cm-1. The excitation profiles of the modes of 1276 and 1476 cm-1 (from 488 to 620 nm) follow the contour of the 700 nm absorption band. The vibrations observed strongly indicate the presence of a bidentate catecholamine-Fe(III) complex in the enzyme as isolated which gives rise to the characteristic charge-transfer transitions. This is further supported by the release of 0.11 +/- 0.04 mol of noradrenaline and 0.25 +/- 0.06 mol of adrenaline per mol of enzyme subunit on denaturation of the enzyme. The energies of the catecholate to Fe(III) charge-transfer transitions indicate a mixture of histidines and carboxylate(s) coordinated to the iron center in tyrosine hydroxylase. At neutral pH, the enzymatic activity was inhibited more than 50% by 10 microM dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline. The high affinity of the catecholamines to the nonphosphorylated form of tyrosine hydroxylase may have significance in vivo since catecholamines are potent feedback inhibitors of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1526178557,"Abstract Mutants of the uncC gene for the epsilon subunit (138 amino acid residues) of Escherichia coli H+-ATPase were isolated: strain KF53 (Gln-72----end) and KF148(SD-) (two base substitutions in the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, GGAGG----AAAGG). These strains did not have F1 bound to membranes and were unable to grow by oxidative phosphorylation. A series of plasmids carrying truncated uncC genes were constructed and introduced into strain KF148(SD-). Analyses of KF148(SD-) cells with different plasmids indicated that the amino-terminal fragment of the epsilon subunit of 78-80 amino acid residues was capable of forming active membrane-bound F1-ATPase, whereas that of 73 residues was not, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal half of the epsilon subunit is not necessary for the active enzyme. Furthermore, results indicated that residues between 73 and 78-80 may have a critical role(s) in binding F1 to F0. Truncated epsilon subunits of 80 and 93 residues were identified in purified F1 from cells carrying the respective uncC genes, and only the latter subunit had intrinsic activity to inhibit ATPase of F1, suggesting that residues between 80 and 93 are essential for the inhibitory activity."
https://openalex.org/W1576964321,"Abstract To define mechanisms regulating expression of M creatine kinase, the human gene including 5'-flanking DNA was cloned, characterized, and partially sequenced. The gene contains 8 exons interrupted by 7 introns spanning 17.5 kilobase pairs of DNA. The intron-exon splice sites were identified and conform to the GT-AG consensus rule. The TATA and CAAT boxes are located at positions -31 and -56 upstream of the transcription start site as determined by primer extension. The 5'-untranslated region is interrupted with the translation start codon located in the second exon. To determine whether sequences within the 5'-upstream DNA confer tissue-specific expression and developmental regulation, constructs containing 2620 base pairs of human M creatine kinase 5'-flanking DNA fused upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in the promoterless plasmid pSVO-CAT were transfected into cultured C2C12 myoblasts. There was 17-fold induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity during differentiation as C2C12 myoblasts fused to form myotubes. The M creatine kinase fusion construct was not expressed in transfected nonmuscle cell lines, COS-7 and NIH/3T3. Thus, cis-acting sequences within 2620 base pairs of the cap site are sufficient to direct developmental regulation and tissue-specific expression of the human M creatine kinase gene."
https://openalex.org/W1974338408,"Studies in animals suggest that fetal neural grafts might restore lost neurological function in Parkinson's disease. In monkeys, such grafts survive for many months and reverse signs of parkinsonism, without attendant graft rejection. The successful and reliable application of a similar transplantation procedure to human patients, however, will require neural tissue obtained from human fetal cadavers, with demonstrated cellular identity, viability, and biological safety. In this report, human fetal neural tissue was successfully grafted into the brains of monkeys. Neural tissue was collected from human fetal cadavers after 9 to 12 weeks of gestation and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. Viability after up to 2 months of storage was demonstrated by cell culture and by transplantation into monkeys. Cryopreservation and storage of human fetal neural tissue would allow formation of a tissue bank. The stored cells could then be specifically tested to assure their cellular identity, viability, and bacteriological and virological safety before clinical use. The capacity to collect and maintain viable human fetal neural tissue would also facilitate research efforts to understand the development and function of the human brain and provide opportunities to study neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1539469446,"We have examined the ability of various forms of activin and inhibin, which are structurally related to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), to interact with various types of cell surface TGF-beta binding sites. Activin AB, inhibin A, and inhibin B were unable to compete with 125I-TGF-beta 1 for binding to the TGF-beta receptor types I, II, or III that coexist in human skin fibroblasts, rat liver epithelial cells, and mink lung epithelial cells. In contrast, activins and inhibins effectively competed for TGF-beta 1 binding to GH3 rat pituitary tumor cells. Binding of TGF-beta 1 to GH3 cells was mediated by about 2700 sites/cell with a Kd = 90 pM. Affinity labeling of these GH3 binding sites by cross-linking to 125I-TGF-beta 1 yielded 70-74-kDa labeled complexes distinct from previously identified TGF-beta binding components. Labeling of these 70-74-kDa components with 125I-TGF-beta 1 was inhibited by TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2, activin AB, and inhibin B at concentrations in the high picomolar to low nanomolar range, but it was not significantly affected by other polypeptide hormones and growth factors tested. The 70-74-kDa labeled GH3 components represent a novel type of cell surface TGF-beta binding protein that is unique in its ability to recognize various other members of the TGF-beta family of bioactive polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1531738583,"The mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by the solubilized mitochondrial ATPase (MF1) has been studied under conditions where catalytic turnover occurs at one site, uni-site catalysis (obtained when enzyme is in excess of substrate), or at two sites, bi-site catalysis (obtained when substrate is in excess of enzyme). Pulse-chase experiments support the conclusion that the sites which participate in bi-site catalysis are the same as those which participate in uni-site catalysis. Upon addition of ATP in molar excess to MF1, label that was bound under uni-site conditions dissociates at a rate equal to the rate of bi-site catalysis. Similarly, when medium ATP is removed, label that was bound under bi-site conditions dissociates at a rate equal to the rate of uni-site catalysis. Evidence that a high affinity catalytic site equivalent to the one observed under uni-site conditions participates as an intermediate in bi-site catalysis includes the demonstration of full occupancy of a catalytically competent site during steady-state turnover at nanomolar concentrations of ATP. Improved measurements of the interaction of ADP at a high affinity catalytic site have lead to the revision of several of the rate constants that define uni-site catalysis. The rate constant for unpromoted dissociation of ADP is equal to that for Pi (4 X 10(-3) s-1). The rate of binding ADP at a high affinity chaseable site (Kd = 1 nM) is equal to the rate of binding ATP (4 X 10(6) M-1 s-1). The rate of catalysis obtained when substrate binding at one site promotes product release from an adjacent site (bi-site catalysis) is up to 100,000-fold faster than unpromoted product release (uni-site catalysis)."
https://openalex.org/W1991556375,"Current vaccine development strategies for malaria depend on widespread immunological responsiveness to candidate antigens such as the zygote surface antigens and the sporozoite coat protein, the circumsporozoite (CS) protein. Since immunological responsiveness is controlled mainly by genes mapping within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), the humoral immune response to the zygote surface antigens and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to the CS protein were examined in MHC-disparate congenic mouse strains. Only two of six strains responded to the 230-kilodalton zygote surface antigen and another two strains responded to the 48/45-kilodalton surface antigen. From two mouse strains, expressing between them five different class I MHC molecules, there was recognition of only a single CTL epitope from the CS protein, which was from a polymorphic segment of the molecule. The restricted CTL response to this protein parallels the restricted antibody response to this protein observed in humans and mice. These findings suggest that subunit malaria vaccines now being developed may be ineffective."
https://openalex.org/W1961286497,"The purified H+-ATPase from chromaffin granules is composed of several polypeptides, one of which has an apparent molecular weight of 39,000. Immunoblots with the antibody against this protein and various membrane preparations showed that similar or even identical polypeptides may be associated with the H+-ATPases from synaptic vesicle, kidney microsomes, and lysosomes. A cDNA library was constructed from bovine adrenal medulla, and the cDNA encoding the polypeptide was isolated and sequenced. Search in DNA and protein data banks revealed no significant homology to known genes. Hydrophobicity plot revealed no obvious transmembrane segments with the exception of one stretch of hydrophobic and neutral amino acid starting at leucine 16. The cDNA was shown to encode the entire polypeptide by the virtue of an amino acid sequence corresponding to the N terminus of the open reading frame and by subunit and site-specific antibodies. The cDNA was cloned into an expression vector, transcribed by T7 polymerase, and translated by reticulocyte lysate. Even though the cDNA encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 31,495, the translation product comigrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels with the subunit of the purified H+-ATPase. In line with several other subunits of vacuolar H+-ATPases, no signal sequence was detected in the translated gene. Northern blots revealed the presence of a single mRNA of about 1.6 kb in bovine adrenal medulla. However, liver, lung, and kidney may contain additional mRNA of about 1.7 kb."
https://openalex.org/W1496745394,"The gene which encodes the beta subunit of the novel membrane-associated ATPase has been identified and characterized. The beta subunit, which is most likely the soluble part of the non-F0F1 type H+-ATPase, was obtained from the archaebacterium, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. In terms of its location, it follows just after the gene for its alpha subunit. It is comprised of 1398 nucleotides, corresponding to a protein of 465 amino acids, and the consensus sequence in the nucleotide binding proteins is poorly conserved. Together with previously described results, the distant homology of the S. acidocaldarius ATPase alpha and beta subunits when compared to those of F0F1-ATPases indicates that this archaebacterial ATPase belongs to an ion-translocating ATPase family uniquely different than F0F1-ATPases even if S. acidocaldarius ATPase and F0F1-ATPases have been derived from a common ancestral ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1518290678,"Two novel compounds, 2-methyl, 4-carboxy, 5-hydroxy-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine (THP(A] and 2-methyl, 4-carboxy-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine (THP(B] have been identified in the pool of Streptomyces parvulus by in vivo and in vitro studies. 13C and 15N were introduced into the compounds by feeding S. parvulus with 15N- and 13C-labeled L-glutamate. High resolution 13C and 15N NMR have been applied to elucidate their structure and biosynthesis in S. parvulus. The splitting patterns and coupling constants of adjacent nitrogen-carbon molecular fragments enable us to unravel their molecular structure. Two different glutamate pools are responsible for their biosynthesis, THP(A) carbon skeleton derives from the extracellular L-[13C]glutamate, whereas THP(B) stems from D-fructose via the intracellular glutamate. During cell growth, THP(A) is synthesized and becomes the major constituent of the intracellular pool. It is consumed after THP(B) is accumulated intracellularly. The onset of THP(A) and -(B) synthesis seems correlated to the time of actinomycin D synthesis. Their high cellular concentrations during actinomycin D synthesis suggest that they may function as nitrogen storage. Other possible functions of THP molecules within the cell are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1970166758,"Malignant progressor tumors are only weakly immunogenic and can evade host recognition and rejection. One approach to therapy involves activation of the host antitumor cellular effector mechanisms. Since monoclonal antibodies to CD3 (anti-CD3) can activate T cells in vitro, an attempt was made to determine if tumor immunity could be achieved by the administration of anti-CD3 in vivo. T lymphocytes from mice injected with anti-CD3 showed increased interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression, increased proliferation to recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2), and enhanced reactivity in both an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction and a mixed lymphocyte tumor culture. Malignant tumor growth in treated mice was also examined. The anti-CD3 treatment prevented tumor outgrowth that would have killed untreated animals and also stimulated an in vivo response against a malignant progressor tumor providing lasting tumor immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1513237156,"The subunit organization of the tonoplast H+-pumping ATPase from oat roots (Avena sativa L. var. Lang) was investigated. Tonoplast vesicles were treated with low ionic strength solutions (0.1 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer or 0.1 mM Na EDTA), carbonate, or a chaotropic reagent (KI), and then centrifuged to give a soluble fraction and a pellet. Treatments with low ionic strength solutions or KI resulted in 70-80% reduction in the membrane-associated ATPase activity, but did not affect the K+-stimulated pyrophosphatase activity. Polypeptides of 72, 60, and 41 kDa were solubilized from tonoplast vesicles by these wash treatments. These polypeptides reacted with polyclonal antibodies against the holoenzyme of tonoplast ATPase (anti-ATPase) and copurified with the tonoplast ATPase activity during gel filtration chromatography (Sepharose CL-6B). Mono-specific antibody against the 72- or 60-kDa polypeptide reacted with the solubilized 72- or 60-kDa polypeptide, respectively. However, the N,N-[14C]dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding 16-kDa polypeptide and a 13-kDa polypeptide that also reacted with anti-ATPase and copurified with the tonoplast ATPase activity during gel filtration remained in the pellets after the wash treatments. We conclude that the 72- and 60-kDa polypeptides appear to be peripheral subunits of the tonoplast ATPase and that the 16-kDa polypeptide is probably embedded in the membrane bilayer. Additional subunits of the ATPase complex may include a 41-kDa (peripheral) and a 13-kDa (integral) polypeptide. Based on these results, a working model of the tonoplast ATPase analogous to the F1F0-ATPase is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1580362736,"The nucleotide sequence of a 3.6-kilobase pair DNA fragment containing the structural gene for yeast cytoplasmic lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KRS1) and its flanking regions was determined. The encoded protein of 67,881 kDa displays a cluster of 11 lysines within a 29-amino acid residue segment at its amino-terminal extremity. Evidence is presented that this segment is responsible for the affinity displayed by the native enzyme toward polyanionic carriers. The transcription initiation sites of the KRS1 gene were determined. Upstream from the TATA box, putative control elements corresponding to the concensus sequences for the RPG box and the general amino acid control system were identified. Evidence for transcriptional induction of the KRS1 gene via the general amino acid control system is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1591680865,"Abstract Cytoplasmic pH (pHi) regulation was studied in thioglycolate-elicited murine macrophages using fluorescent probes. Acid-loaded macrophages regained normal pHi by extrusion of H+ equivalents across the plasma membrane. A fraction of this recovery was due to Na+/H+ exchange, as evidenced by its partial Na+ dependence and amiloride sensitivity. The residual, Na+-independent pHi recovery (approximately 50% of the total) persisted in the nominal absence of HCO3- and was insensitive to disulfonic stilbenes, ruling out mediation by anion exchange. In contrast, intracellular alkalinization and H+ extrusion from the cells were inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or by prior depletion of intracellular ATP. These observations are consistent with the existence of a H+-pumping ATPase in the plasma membrane of macrophages. The mechanism of activation of the ATP-dependent H+ extrusion process was also investigated. In other systems, Ca2+ mobilization has been suggested to signal an exocytic insertion of H+ pumps into the plasma membrane. Acid loading of macrophages was accompanied by an elevation of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), measured using indo-1. These results are consistent with a role for Ca2+ mobilization in the activation of H+ extrusion."

B., Pagan, J., Parsonage, D., Hatch, L., and Senior, A. E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8981-8984) suggested that this domain is formed by residues 160-340, approximately, in alpha-subunit. Within this proposed domain is a sequence Gly-X-X-X-X-Gly-Lys which is conserved in a large and diverse group of nucleotide-binding proteins and is thought to interact with phosphate groups of bound nucleotide. In this work, residue alpha Lys-175, the terminal residue of the above conserved sequence in F1-alpha-subunit, was mutagenized to Ile or Glu. The specific activity of purified mutant F1-ATPase was reduced by 2.5-fold (Ile) or 3-fold (Glu). Apparent binding of ATP to alpha-subunit, as measured by the centrifuge column procedure, was strongly impaired and ATP-induced conformational change in alpha-subunit, as measured by protection against trypsin proteolysis, was nearly abolished in both mutants. The results suggest that residue alpha Lys-175 is located within the nucleotide-binding domain of alpha-subunit, and that this residue is functionally involved in nucleotide binding. The results support previous suggestions that the alpha-subunit nucleotide-binding site is not involved, directly or indirectly, in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2074824786,"A peptide 60 residues in length that corresponds to the homeo domain of Antennapedia (Antp), a protein governing development in Drosophila, was synthesized by segment condensation with protected peptide segments prepared on an oxime resin. A footprinting assay showed that the homeo domain binds specifically to a TAA repeat DNA sequence in the Antp gene. Thus the Antp homeo domain has a sequence-specific DNA binding property. The circular dichroism spectra of the homeo domain peptide showed the presence of a significant amount of alpha-helical structure in aqueous solution and in 50 percent trifluoroethanol. The alpha helicity measured in water appears to depend on the peptide concentration, which suggests that the peptide aggregates. These results support the hypothesis that the homeo domain binds to DNA through a helix-turn-helix motif."
https://openalex.org/W1548348654,"Abstract The 1701-base nucleotide sequence (not including the poly(A) tail) of a cDNA for the gamma subunit of the ATP synthase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was determined. A start translation sequence, 23 bases in from the 5' end, initiates an 1074-base-long open reading frame. The sequence of the first 21 amino acids at the amino-terminal end of the mature gamma subunit from C. reinhardtii was determined and compared to the deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame. From this it was determined that the mature protein contains 323 amino acids, with the first 35 amino acids probably being part of the transit peptide. The length of the mature protein is the same as that for the mature gamma subunit from spinach, for which only a few of the amino acids of the transit peptide are known. The similarity of the two mature proteins at the nucleotide level is 56% while at the amino acid level it is 77%. In addition, the 3 cysteines, which in spinach are involved in the energy-linked catalytic functions of the ATP synthase, are conserved in the predicted amino acid sequence for the gamma subunit from C. reinhardtii. In contrast, the mature C. reinhardtii gamma subunit contains 3 additional cysteine residues not found in the spinach gamma subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2100861942,"Abstract Six chromosomal uncF mutants of Escherichia coli defective in the b subunit of H+-ATPase (156 amino acid residues) were identified (KF92, Met-1----Val; KF164, Gln-64----end; KF61 and KF144, Gln-104----end; KF138, Gln-106----end; and KF79, Gln-123----end). The membranes of all these mutants had low ATPase activities (less than 5% of that of the wild type), and no functional H+ pathway, although the truncated b subunits were integrated into these membranes. These findings suggest that about 30 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of the b subunit are essential for formation of the F1-binding site and H+ pathway. For examination of the role(s) of the carboxyl-terminal region(s) or residue(s) of the b subunit, recombinant plasmids carrying truncated uncF genes of various lengths were constructed by in vitro muta-genesis and introduced into a recA1 derivative of strain KF92 (Met-1----Val). Analyses of the membranes from the resulting strains demonstrated that almost the entire carboxyl-terminal region of the b subunit is necessary for formation of functional Fo, since loss of the carboxyl-terminal residue resulted in significant reduction of both F1 binding and H+ translocation, and loss of two or more residues abolished both activities completely."
https://openalex.org/W1512225972,"Lophotoxin and lophotoxin analog-1 are uncharged cyclic diterpenes obtained from gorgonian corals. They have been shown to block the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Inhibition results from blockade of the agonist recognition site and appears irreversible in that extensive washing does not restore receptor function. This study was undertaken to determine whether this apparently irreversible inhibition involves covalent labeling at a selective site and to further characterize this site directly. Incubation of membranes prepared from the electric organ of Torpedo californica with analog-1 followed by reduction with NaB3H4 resulted in the incorporation of radioactivity into several membrane proteins. The incorporation of radioactivity into the alpha-subunit of the receptor was blocked by prior incubation with agonists and antagonists. [3H]Lophotoxin and [3H]analog-1 were prepared by reduction with NaB3H4 and back-oxidation with CrO3. The radiolabeled coral toxins reacted selectively and covalently with the alpha-subunit of the receptor. Their binding was prevented by prior exposure to agonists and antagonists. In contrast to the site-directed alkylating agent 4-(N-maleimido)benzyltrimethylammonium iodide, prior reduction of the receptor was not required for covalent binding of 3H-labeled coral toxins. Selective reduction of Cys192 and Cys193 followed by alkylation with 4-(N-maleimido)benzyltrimethylammonium iodide blocked the binding of [3H]analog-1, whereas alkylation with iodoacetic acid or iodoacetamide did not. Thus, the binding site for the coral toxins does not overlap the binding surface near Cys192 and Cys193. Digestion of isolated labeled alpha-subunits with endoglycosidase H revealed that the polypeptide portion of the protein retained the covalently bound [3H]analog-1. Digestion with staphylococcal V8 protease revealed two major peptides of approximately 19 and 20 kDa, along with several smaller peptides. Only the 20-kDa peptide retained the covalently bound [3H]analog-1, localizing the site of covalent attachment between Ser173 and Glu335. The unique chemical structure and covalent reactivity of these gorgonian coral toxins will undoubtedly allow further insights into the structure of the agonist recognition site."
https://openalex.org/W1556861714,"The mammalian (Na+,K+), Ca2+-, and (H+,K+)-ATPases contain a well-characterized lysine residue that reacts with fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate (FITC); enzymatic activity is protected by ATP, suggesting that the residue is located in or near the nucleotide-binding domain. In this study, the plasma-membrane H+-ATPase of Neurospora crassa is also shown to be sensitive to FITC. The reaction occurs with pseudo first-order kinetics, has a pKa of 8.0, and is stimulated by Mg2+. Enzymatic activity is protected by MgADP with a Kd of 0.2-0.3 mM, close to the Ki with which MgADP serves as a competitive inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis. A tryptic peptide labeled with FITC in the absence, but not in the presence, of MgADP has been isolated and sequenced. The FITC-sensitive residue is Lys474, located in a region that exhibits significant homology with the mammalian cation-transporting ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W1531420755,"The inhibition of purified bovine adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase by several product and substrate analogues has been studied to probe the kinetic mechanism. Norepinephrine, dopamine, and methylcatechol are competitive inhibitors versus tetrahydropterins and noncompetitive inhibitors versus tyrosine. 3-Iodotyrosine is an uncompetitive inhibitor versus tetrahydropterins and a competitive inhibitor versus tyrosine. The Ki value for 3-iodotyrosine depends on the tetrahydropterin used. These results are consistent with tetrahydropterin binding first to the free enzyme followed by binding of tyrosine. 5-Deaza-6-methyltetrahydropterin is a noncompetitive inhibitor versus tetrahydropterins and tyrosine. The effect of varying the concentration of tyrosine on the Ki value for 5-deaza-6-methyltetrahydropterin is consistent with the binding of this inhibitor to both the free enzyme and to an enzyme-dihydroxyphenylalanine complex. Dihydroxyphenylalanine also is a noncompetitive inhibitor versus tetrahydropterins and tyrosine; the effect of changing the fixed substrate is consistent with the binding of this inhibitor to both the free enzyme and to the enzyme-tetrahydropterin complex. The effect of pH on the Ki values was determined in order to measure the pKa values of amino acid residues involved in substrate binding. Tight binding of catechols requires that a group with a pKa value of 7.6 be deprotonated. Binding of 3-iodotyrosine involves two groups with pKa values of 7.5 and about 5.5, one of which must be protonated for binding. Binding of 5-deaza-6-methyltetrahydropterin requires that a group on the free enzyme with a pKa value of 6.1 be protonated. The Ki value for dihydroxyphenylalanine is relatively insensitive to pH, but the inhibition pattern changes from noncompetitive to competitive above pH 7.5, consistent with the measured pKa values for binding to the free enzyme and to the enzyme-tetrahydropterin complex."
https://openalex.org/W1599273508,"Liver cytosols contain factors that produce an inhibitor of tyrosine aminotransferase and other enzymes when incubated with L-cysteine or L-cystine. Cystine-dependent inactivation was caused by cystathionase and required pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, but a second protein was needed to reconstitute cysteine-dependent inactivation. A cytosolic protein was isolated that oxidized free cysteine and brought about inactivation of tyrosine aminotransferase when coincubated with cystathionase. Hematin also oxidized cysteine, which led to cysteine-dependent inactivation of tyrosine aminotransferase in the presence of cystathionase. The inactivation of tyrosine aminotransferase involved three steps: initial oxidation of cysteine to form cystine; desulfuration of cystine catalyzed by cystathionase to form the persulfide, thiocysteine; and reaction of thiocysteine (or products of its decomposition) with proteins to form protein-bound sulfane. Since dithiothreitol reactivated tyrosine aminotransferase, the sulfane probably inactivated the enzyme by oxidation of thiol groups. The present results do not indicate whether the cysteine oxidase activity is enzymatic nor do they prove which form of polysulfide inactivates tyrosine aminotransferase. Reduced glutathione greatly slowed the rates at which sulfane accumulated and at which tyrosine aminotransferase was inactivated. Incubation of DL-cystathionine with liver cytosols led to formation of cysteine, which was oxidized and cleaved to form persulfide, and caused inactivation of tyrosine aminotransferase. Thus, sulfane sulfur that is generated by an enzyme of the transulfuration pathway inactivates a transaminase by nonselective oxidation of enzyme-bound thiol groups."
https://openalex.org/W1503991018,"The pH-dependent kinetics of lysyl oxidase catalysis was examined for evidence of an ionizable enzyme residue which might function as a general base catalyzing proton abstraction previously shown to be a component of the mechanism of substrate processing by this enzyme. Plots of log Vmax/Km for the oxidation of n-hexylamine versus pH yielded pKa values of 7.0 +/- 0.1 and 10.4 +/- 0.1. The higher pKa varied with different substrates, reflecting ionization of the substrate amino group. A van't Hoff plot of the temperature dependence of the lower pKa yielded a value of 6.1 kcal mol-1 for the enthalpy of ionization. This value as well as the pKa of 7.0 are consistent with those of histidine residues previously implicated as general base catalysts in enzymes. Incubation of lysyl oxidase with low concentrations of diethyl pyrocarbonate, a histidine-selective reagent, at 22 degrees C and pH 7.0 irreversibly inhibited enzyme activity by a pseudo first-order kinetic process. The inactivation of lysyl oxidase correlated with spectral and pH-dependent kinetic evidence for the chemical modification of 1 histidine residue/mol of enzyme, the pKa of which was 6.9 +/- 0.1, within experimental error of that seen in the plot of log Vmax/Km versus pH. Enzyme activity was restored by incubation of the modified enzyme with hydroxylamine, consistent with the ability of this nucleophile to displace the carbethoxy group from N-carbethoxyhistidine. The presence of the n-hexylamine substrate largely protected against enzyme inactivation by diethyl pyrocarbonate. These results thus indicate a functional role for histidine in lysyl oxidase catalysis consistent with that of a general base in proton abstraction."
https://openalex.org/W1664036759,"Insulin has been shown to inhibit rat growth hormone (GH) gene transcription. The effects of insulin were therefore tested on the expression of a transfected human GH gene. A 2.6-kilobase EcoRI fragment of the human GH gene was propagated in pUC18 and transfected by calcium-phosphate shock into HeLa and GC cells, respectively. Transfected cells grown in serum-free medium for 72 h expressed human GH measured by specific radioimmunoassay, incorporation of [35S] methionine into newly synthesized GH, and the presence of the appropriately sized protected transcripts seen after RNase protection assay. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that insulin (0.7-7 nM) suppressed both the basal as well as the hydrocortisone (100 nM)-stimulated expression of newly synthesized 22-kDa GH in a dose-dependent fashion. Insulin (7 nM) also suppressed the basal and hydrocortisone-stimulated GH mRNA transcripts in these cells. Control nontransfected cells did not express human GH. Cells transfected with the truncated pOGH gene and pTKGH gene failed to respond to insulin treatment, whereas the human GH promoter was able to confer insulin responsiveness to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. cis-Acting regulatory sequences residing on the 497-base pair 5'-flanking region of the human GH gene therefore appear to be a requirement for human GH gene response to the insulin signal."
https://openalex.org/W1584035450,"In order to assess the role of thiol groups in the Fo part of the ATP synthase in the coupling mechanism of ATP synthase, we have treated isolated Fo, extracted from beef heart Complex V with urea, with thiol reagents, primarily with diazenedicarboxylic acid bis-(dimethylamide) (diamide) but also with Cd2+ and N-ethylmaleimide. FoF1 ATP synthase was reconstituted by adding isolated F1 and the oligomycin-sensitivity-conferring-protein (OSCP) to Fo. The efficiency of reconstitution was assessed by determining the sensitivity to oligomycin of the ATP hydrolytic activity of the reconstituted enzyme. Contrary to Cd2+, incubation of diamide with Fo, before the addition of F1 and OSCP, induced a severe loss of oligomycin sensitivity, due to an inhibited binding of F1 to Fo. This effect was reversed by dithiothreitol. Conversely, if F1 and OSCP were added to Fo before diamide, no effect could be detected. These results show that F1 (and/or OSCP) protects Fo thiols from diamide and are substantiated by the finding that the oligomycin sensitivity of ATP hydrolysis activity of isolated Complex V was also unaltered by diamide. Gel electrophoresis of FoF1 ATP synthase, reconstituted with diamide-treated Fo, revealed that the loss of oligomycin sensitivity was directly correlated with diminution of band Fo 1 (or subunit b). Concomitantly a band appeared of approximately twice the molecular weight of subunit Fo 1. As this protein contains only 1 cysteine residue (Walker, J. E., Runswick, M. J., and Poulter, L. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 197, 89-100), the effect of diamide is attributed to the formation of a disulfide bridge between two of these subunits. These results offer further evidence for the proposal, based on aminoacid sequence and structural analysis, that subunit Fo 1 of mammalian Fo is involved in the binding with F1 (Walker et al. (1987]. N-Ethylmaleimide affects oligomycin sensitivity to a lesser extent than diamide, suggesting that the mode of action of these reagents (and the structural changes induced in Fo) is different."
https://openalex.org/W1554398774,"Previous investigations on the distribution of [18O]Pi isotopomers formed by hydrolysis of [gamma-18O]ATP by the chloroplast F1-ATPase (CF1) showed that a single reaction pathway is used by all participating sites and that the pathway is modulated by ATP concentration as expected for cooperative interactions between catalytic sites. Such oxygen exchange measurements have been applied to CF1 modified at a single catalytic or noncatalytic site by 2-azido adenine nucleotides. When less than one catalytic or one noncatalytic site per enzyme is modified, hydrolysis occurs in part by the pathway of the unmodified enzyme plus at least one additional pathway at 200 microM and two additional pathways at 4 microM [gamma-18O]ATP. Thus, three sites are potentially catalytically active. The two new pathways shown by the derivatized enzyme logically can arise from nonidentical interactions of the remaining two underivatized beta subunits with the derivatized beta subunit. Reversals of bound ATP cleavage before Pi is released are increased, and the amount of product formed by the new pathways is changed when the ATP concentration is lowered. These modulations must result from the behavior of two remaining active catalytic sites rather than of one catalytic and one regulatory site. When the CF1 is derivatized more extensively, the original catalytic pathway is lost, and two catalytic pathways that do not show modulation by ATP concentration are found. The remaining beta subunits now have weak but independent catalytic capacity. In addition, the enzyme is no longer activated by Ca2+, loses MgGTPase activity, and is much less sensitive to azide."
https://openalex.org/W1608288941,"High resolution deuterium NMR spectra were obtained from suspensions of five bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Deuterium-labeled D-glucose at C-1, C-2, and C-6 was used to monitor dynamically anaerobic metabolism. The flux of glucose through the various bacterial metabolic pathways could be determined by following the disappearance of glucose and the appearance of the major end products in the 2H NMR spectrum. The presence of both labeled and unlabeled metabolites could be detected using 1H NMR spectroscopy since the proton resonances in the labeled species are shifted upfield due to an isotopic chemical shift effect. The 1H-1H scalar coupling observed in both the 2H and 1H NMR spectra was used to assign definitively the resonances of labeled species. An increase in the intensity of natural abundance deuterium signal of water can be used to monitor pathways in which a deuteron is lost from the labeled metabolite. The steps in which label loss can occur are outlined, and the influence these processes have on the ability of 2H NMR spectroscopy to monitor metabolism are assessed."
https://openalex.org/W1601541531,"Abstract Somatostatin (SRIF) is a 14-amino acid peptide hormone that is present in pancreatic islets and the brain where it is synthesized as a larger precursor, preprosomatostatin. In pancreatic islets of the anglerfish (Lophius americanus), there are two separate precursors, preproSRIF I and preproSRIF II, which give rise to SRIF-14 or an N-terminally extended form SRIF-28, respectively. Significantly higher levels of preproSRIF I compared to preproSRIF II are synthesized in pancreatic islets. We show here that preproSRIF II mRNA possesses an eight-nucleotide repeat (CCAGCAGA) which is present three times in its 5'-noncoding region; this sequence is absent from preproSRIF I mRNA. Progressive deletion of these octameric repeats results in the concomitant enhancement of preproSRIF II mRNA translation in vitro. Furthermore, expression of native or 5'-truncated preproSRIF II mRNA in non-islet tissue culture cells, using a retroviral expression vector, gave identical results to those obtained in vitro, indicating that differential translation was a function of the mRNA rather than the translation system. We propose that the octameric repeat sequence, or a subset of it, is responsible for attenuation of preproSRIF II mRNA translation. Since the differential translation of preproSRIF II mRNA was reproduced in widely divergent systems, this suggests that our results are not related to islet cell gene expression per se. Rather, it is possible they have general significance in that the 5'-repeat sequences may be recognized by putative trans-acting factors involved in the translational regulation of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1607200279,"Abstract Previous work with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) has defined two sites on the Neurospora plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Modification of one (the site) by NEM is rapid but does not affect ATPase activity, while modification of the other (the site) inactivates the enzyme and is protectable by MgATP or MgADP. In the present study, a wider array of sulfhydryl reagents have been used to examine the properties of both sites. The results show the following. (a) Both fast and slow sites react preferentially with hydrophobic compounds (N-pyrenemaleimide, dithiobisnitropyridine greater than N-naphthylmaleimide, dithiobisnitrobenzoate greater than N-phenylmaleimide greater than N-ethylmaleimide) and are virtually insensitive to hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents such as iodoacetamide and iodoacetic acid. (b) The reaction rate of the slow site with NEM is approximately 2000-fold less rapid than that of the fast site. The slow site also has an unusually high pKa (greater than 9.5). (c) Whether or not cysteine modification leads to inactivation of the ATPase depends upon the site and the reagent. For example, when the fast site reacts with NEM, enzymatic activity is retained; when it reacts with N-pyrenemaleimide, activity is lost. Likewise, when the slow site is modified by any of the maleimides or by dithiobisnitropyridine or dithiobisnitrobenzoate, the ATPase is inactivated; when it is modified by methylmethanethiosulfonate, activity remains intact. Thus, neither cysteine can be considered to play an essential role in the reaction cycle of the ATPase, but the introduction of a sufficiently bulky substituent at either site can disrupt activity. (d) Upon reaction of methylmethanethiosulfonate at the slow site, the K1/2 for MgATP hydrolysis is reduced from 0.65 to 0.25 mM. This result strengthens the evidence for a conformational relationship between the slow site cysteine and the nucleotide binding site of the ATPase."

The activities of HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase in livers of 17-day-old rat pups reared on the low-cholesterol diet were enhanced three- to fivefold over those observed in the age-matched rats in the normal cholesterol and mother-reared control groups. The concentration of cholesterol in plasma of rats reared on the low-cholesterol milk was about 20% lower than that for mother-reared controls. In contrast, rats reared on milk with normal cholesterol content exhibited plasma cholesterol levels about 25 and 50% higher than the mother-reared and low cholesterol groups, respectively. The long-term metabolic consequences of rearing rats on milk formulations without adequate cholesterol remains to be determined.—Auestad, N.; Korsak, R. A.; Morrow, J. W.; West, D. B.; Bergstrom, J.
