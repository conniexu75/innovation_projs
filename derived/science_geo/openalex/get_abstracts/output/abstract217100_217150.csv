Such changes are probably causally related to the tocopherol requirement, the incidence of chick encephalomalacia, and the peroxide hemolysis test. Whether similar mechanisms are involved in the ability of unsaturated oils to lower serum cholesterol levels remains to be determined."

https://openalex.org/W2063078292,Cache Valley virus was isolated from Culiseta inornata mosquitoes collected in Utah. The newly isolated agent causes signs of encephalitis in mice inoculated intracerebrally. It has been classified with the Bunyamwera group of anthropod-borne (Arbor) viruses.

From such curves, in contrast to those based on logarithmic transformations, both the end point of the titration and the dissociation constant can be derived."

https://openalex.org/W108729284,"The dietary deficiency of essential fatty acids results in anatomical changes in animals, which are accompanied by changes in the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of the tissues (1). The chemical manifestations of the deficiency are principally a greatly increased content of trienoic acids and a decrease in the other polyunsaturated acids in the tissues, notably in the heart and liver (2). Klein and Johnson (3) have demonstrated that polyunsaturated acids occur in the subcellular granules, and that changes in the polyunsaturated acids content of these granules begin much earlier in the deficiency than the external symptoms appear (4). Essential fatty acid deficiency is accompanied by an abnormal metabolism. Burr and Beber (5) found that deficient rats have a higher basal metabolic rate, higher specific dynamic action of foods, and higher respiratory quotients than do normal rats. Deficiency has been found to cause changes in the enzyme activities of tissues. Endogenous respiration of the liver decreases, liver cytochrome oxidase increases, choline oxidase increases slightly, the titer of antimycin A-sensitive factor increases, and the P:O ratios of enzyme preparations decrease markedly in deficiency (6, 7). In fat deficiency, succinic dehydrogenase, glutamic dehydrogenase, and butyric dehydrogenase activities are also reduced significantly (8). Ultraviolet irradiation of rat liver mitochondria, or the addition of partly oxidized linoleate or linolenate, factors which could induce oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, were found to inhibit succinoxidase activity (9). These several lines of evidence suggest that polyunsaturated acids are necessary for or are involved in some enzyme activities. In the light of the information summarized above, it seemed pertinent to measure the content of polyunsaturated acids in enzyme preparations of mitochondrial origin. The data presented here show that polyunsaturated acids are present in significant amounts in these enzyme complexes, and are consistent with the suggestion that polyenoic acids may have some function in the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by these complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2093575791,Treatment of an avirulent strain of Trichomonas gallinae with a cellfree homogenate of a virulent strain resulted in enhanced virulence as evidenced by the size of lesions produced in mice. Addition of deoxyribonuclease to the homogenate cell mixture blocked the transformation.

https://openalex.org/W1994410444,"BY field observations, dissections and analyses of field samples it was discovered that the female diapause in Coccinella 7-punctata L. (Col. : Coccinellidae) is connected with a gonotrophic dissociation, which is not the case in male individuals. After the induction of diapause the adults of both sexes accumulate reserves (fats and glycogen) ; afterwards they stop feeding and migrate towards the winter quarters. During this prehibernation accumulative feeding-period, the females remain sexually immature. On the other hand, for males the maturation of gonads is not such a strain on energy reserves ; both diapausing and active males rapidly reach maturity and only stop tissue activity in testicular follicles immediately before hibernation. At this period they have already accumulated sperm reserves in the seminal vesicles and encysted sperms in the testicular follicles. Already before hibernation they fertilize a part of the females, hibernating afterwards with sperm reserves in the spermatheca. In the spring the males renew their sexual activity long before the females. They fertilize females in the hibernating quarters. The ovaria mature later—only after feeding on the essential aphid food. During hibernation the fat reserves in both sexes are reduced to a half; the glycogen in males to one-fifth, in females to one-third."

https://openalex.org/W2079648134,"THE isolation and structure of citronin, a new flavanone glycoside from the peel of immature Ponderosa lemons (Citrus limon Burm. f. ponderosa Hort.) was reported some time ago by Yamamoto and Oshima1. From chemical and spectroscopic evidence it was concluded that citronin is 2′-methoxy-5,7-dihydroxyflavanone 7-rhamnoglucoside (I) and thus belongs to the rather uncommon group of flavonoids having a substituent at position 2′. In attempting to obtain this compound from samples of both mature and immature Ponderosa lemons, under conditions approximating those of Yamamoto and Oshima, it has been our experience that the only glycoside which can be isolated easily in crystalline form is neohesperidin (II). This was identified by elementary analyses, mixed melting point determination, infra-red spectrum, preparation of the phenylhydrazone derivative and isolation of the aglycone hesperetin from the hydrolysate. Neohesperidin differs from hesperidin only in the position of attachment of rhamnose to glucose2:"

Until recently it was considered to be a true endocrine gland ; but today it is widely held that the process serves as an organ for the storage and release of hormones elaborated by the neurones of certain hypothalamic nuclei1."
